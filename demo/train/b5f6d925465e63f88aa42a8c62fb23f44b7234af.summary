-- a pioneer in sales of digital music , @entity1 on monday became a late entrant in the booming music - streaming wars			1
when its @entity9 feature launches this fall along with a new version of @entity1 's mobile operating system , it will go head - to - head with established competitors such as @entity14 and @entity15 , as well as other tech heavyweights in @entity18 - affiliated @entity17 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
all of which raises the question : in a crowded field , what 's going to persuade people already using ( and , in some cases , paying for ) those other services to switch to @entity1 's ? @entity1 appears to be banking on the extensive music library it 's piled up on @entity30 and the customer base that 's already used to shopping there			1
the @entity33 boasts a catalog of 26 million songs ( @entity17 , by way of comparison , claims more than 20 million ) and more than 50 billion files have been downloaded from @entity30 since it launched in 2001			1
" as a large company , @entity1 has a few major advantages , " said @entity39 , chief technical officer at @entity41 's @entity40			2
" they have a large and loyal customer base established and the capability to be competitive with advertising revenue rates , both providing great incentive for music publishers			0
" but after monday 's announcement , many folks in tech circles seemed less bullish on the idea			0
for a company that built its empire on bold leaps into the unknown -- few had heard of smartphones before the @entity59 or tablets before the @entity61 -- web radio feels like a copycat maneuver , they said			0
it remains to be seen whether @entity1 will go all - in with the product , seeing it as the logical extension of its @entity30 brand , or float it as an afterthought , like its short - lived and seldom - used ping social site			1
" @entity1 's entry is a discovery tool that seems to exist just to help sell you tracks from the @entity30 music store , " wrote @entity73 at @entity74			1
" but hey , at least it has streaming @entity81			0
" @entity1 vice president @entity82 does n't exactly stifle that line of thought			2
" @entity9 is an incredible way to listen to personalized radio stations which have been created just for you , " @entity82 said in the statement			2
" it 's the music you love most and the music you 're going to love , and you can easily buy it from the @entity33 with just one click			2
" it 's no mystery why @entity1 , like @entity18 , @entity20 and @entity19 before them , wants in on music streaming			1
streaming , by which users listen to ad - supported music for free or pay a monthly fee , is the fastest growing form of music listening , according to industry reports			1
the @entity101 , in its annual report , said that while overall music sales were down in 2012 , digital - music sales were up 14 % , topping $ 4 billion			0
" digital growth was driven by large increases in revenues through what can broadly be referred to as ' access models , ' where users can choose to listen from large libraries of music rather than purchasing individual songs or albums , " the report read			0
@entity1 's offering will be ad - supported , in addition to serving as another portal into the @entity33			1
and unlike most of its competitors , which are available across platforms , it will only be accessible on @entity1 products			0
like @entity14 , users will be able to " seed " stations with particular artists and hear selections from similar ones			0
@entity1 will track a user 's selections , as well as their @entity30 purchase history , to continually fine - tune their stations to their tastes			1
on mobile devices , users will be able to ask voice - activated " assistant " @entity136 to play , skip or pause songs , or to search for groups , or styles of music to play			2
but in the wake of the announcement , most analysis focused on an apparent lack of innovation on @entity1 's part			1
if it ai n't broke , the thought went , why does @entity1 want to fix it ? " @entity9 is a @entity14 knockoff , " @entity151 of finance site @entity149 told @entity0			2
" it absolutely will not come close to @entity14 in terms of functionality and user experience			0
it ca n't possibly do that			0
@entity14 is a 13 - year - old company ...			0
@entity1 is just doing what everyone else had done -- copying it			0

@entity1 's @entity9 joins crowded music - streaming field
feature will be ad - supported , feature @entity30 ' 26 million songs
some question whether there 's a need for more streaming
