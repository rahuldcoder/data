@entity0 -- in the estimation of @entity4 and his top campaign aides , there were no gaffes , no mistakes , no ill - advised statements on the @entity11 candidate 's overseas trip			1
the poorly timed comments at the @entity13 ? no big deal			0
the remarks in @entity16 that inflamed the @entity17 ? overblown			0
the off - color words to the press by a @entity4 aide tuesday ? in the heat of the moment			2
a trip that was supposed to show off the former governor 's foreign policy expertise during an election year has been plagued with distractions as well as marked by substantive highlights			2
@entity29 seeks to convert on @entity4 " fumbles " still , as the candidate wrapped up his last leg in @entity33 , a senior @entity4 adviser said the campaign will land back in the @entity36 late tuesday , supremely confident of the results on the ground			1
" i think it was a great success , " @entity4 adviser @entity39 said after the @entity11 contender 's foreign policy speech in @entity0 , the last leg of the campaign 's three - country tour			1
" the idea is that , can people get a good sense of who he is ? can people listen and see that this is a person speaking from the heart about @entity16 and about @entity33 ? and he is , " @entity39 added			2
in a speech at @entity33 's national library , @entity4 offered an emotional tribute to the former @entity61 bloc country 's journey from the @entity62 to the economic envy of @entity64			1
" i , and my fellow @entity36 , are inspired by the path of freedom tread by the people of @entity33 , " @entity4 said			1
@entity4 blames media for bad press in its final hours in @entity33 , the @entity4 campaign talked of its " great success " while being bombarded by criticism over moments that did not go so well			1
for @entity4 , the trouble began in @entity75 , when he publicly questioned whether @entity76 was ready to host the @entity77			2
@entity75 prime minister @entity81 retorted that it was far more difficult to organize the @entity13 in a world capital than in the " middle of nowhere , " a not - so - subtle dig at @entity79 in @entity80			0
@entity76 tabloids dubbed @entity4 " @entity85			2
" @entity4 talks tough but differs little from @entity29 on @entity86 but on the campaign 's chartered flight from @entity76 to the next leg of the trip , @entity16 , @entity4 's policy advisers declined to comment on the candidate 's comments			1
in one of the great stage - crafting moments of his campaign , @entity4 delivered a stout defense of @entity16 's right to exist			1
he warned @entity86 leaders that weaponizing the country 's nuclear program would lead to war			0
however , @entity4 also outraged @entity17 leaders with his talk of @entity106 as the undisputed capital of @entity16			0
he commented at a fundraiser in the same city that " culture " can partly explain the economic disparity between @entity16 and @entity17 , inflaming the already raw feelings in the region			0
@entity4 was in no mood to answer questions from his traveling press corps about his " from the heart " straight talk			2
he took only three questions from the journalists after his overseas trip			0
after @entity4 paid tribute at the @entity125 , members of the traveling press attempted to ask about some of his perceived gaffes , only to be shouted down by the campaign 's traveling press secretary			1
this is a holy site , " @entity131 barked at one reporter			0
" shove it , " he said to another			0
@entity131 later called two reporters and apologized			0
after @entity4 's speech , @entity39 noted , the candidate did sit down for a number of interview with @entity36 television networks , including @entity1			1
" the reports that we get back are very positive , " @entity39 said of reviews the campaign 's trip is receiving from supporters			2
@entity29 : @entity4 trip an ' embarrassing disaster ' before the campaign aide 's verbal assault on the press , conservative bloggers were protesting that @entity4 's overseas trip was being judged unfairly in the media			1
" by any reasonable standard , @entity4 's trip has been successful			1
yet press coverage has been unrelentingly negative , " @entity158 blog writer @entity158 wrote			0
@entity160 , an anchor on the @entity161 , @entity4 's go - to network for interviews , had a different assessment of the coverage			1
" there has been no press access to governor @entity4 since we landed in @entity33			1
we ( press ) are in a holding pattern ( i ca n't help but feel a bit like the press is a modified petting zoo since we are trapped in a bus while @entity125 citizens take pictures of us			0
) , " @entity178 wrote on her blog			0
when @entity4 returns to the states , he will be greeted by a slew of new ads from his campaign and from super pacs supporting him , as well as a new @entity186 and @entity188 mobile app called " @entity189 , " about his vp selection process			2
even while away , the campaign never stops			0
who should @entity4 pick for his vp ? let us know your choice on @entity197 .			0
