-- @entity1 have continued their dream start to the @entity6 @entity5 season , beating @entity7 2 - 0 to remain top of the table with three wins out of three			1
the home side went into the half - time break with a one goal advantage , thanks to a header from @entity18 defender @entity17 , who powered home a cross from captain @entity21			1
it was @entity17 's second successive goal following his winning strike against @entity25 two weeks ago			0
and the points were sealed when @entity6 international goalkeeper @entity27 was left helpless when @entity29 's free - kick struck the post , bounced off his chest , and flew into the net			1
the result leaves @entity1 with a 100 per cent record , although four other sides are also in that position going into the weekend 's @entity5 fixtures			2
however , big - spending @entity7 , who gave a debut to @entity41 international striker @entity40 , are still without a point and struggling near the foot of the table , increasing the pressure on coach @entity46 who nearly took the @entity47 to the @entity5 title last season			1
" i am satisfied with the game , we produced a good performance , " @entity46 told @entity50			0
" unfortunately , we conceded two goals , that is unfortunate , but it can happen			0
" @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 can all join @entity1 at the top of the table on saturday if they win their respective matches			2
meanwhile , defending champions @entity65 take on @entity66 on saturday .			0

@entity1 keep up their dream start to the @entity6 @entity5 season
the league *leaders* secure their third *straight* **victory** with a 2 - 0 win over @entity7
an @entity17 header and a late @entity27 own goal *ensured* the hosts ' **victory**
@entity7 , who gave a debut to @entity40 - @entity40 , have now lost all three matches
