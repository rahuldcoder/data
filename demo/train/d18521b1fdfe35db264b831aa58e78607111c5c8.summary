-- @entity2 voters rejected the legalization of marijuana tuesday , according to a @entity0 projection based on exit polling			1
supporters of @entity8 argued that the " prohibition " of marijuana -- much like that for alcohol decades ago -- has created a violent criminal black market , led today by international drug cartels			2
they asserted that even if the proposition were to pass , federal law still prohibits individuals and groups from manufacturing , distributing and possessing marijuana for recreational use			0
@entity22 attorney general @entity21 said he will continue to enforce that federal law			0
opponents also said that driving under the influence of marijuana would be a public threat			0
supporters said the measure could have generated tax revenue from the $ 14 billion - a - year marijuana business in @entity2 and save the state hundreds of millions of dollars annually by ending the arrests of 61,000 @entity2 a year for misdemeanor marijuana possession			1
@entity2 has already legalized medical marijuana			1
legal cannabis for the rest of us ? a measure that would have legalized medical marijuana in @entity40 also failed , according to another @entity0 projection based on exit polling			1
results were still pending for a similar medical marijuana measure in @entity45			1
a total of 14 states and the @entity48 have already legalized marijuana for medical care only			2
meanwhile , among the many initiatives on ballots tuesday , four states -- @entity54 , @entity45 , @entity55 and @entity40 -- approved a measure that will guarantee workers the right to vote by secret ballot on whether they want union representation , according to @entity0 projections based on exit polling			1
the anti-union measures are considered pre-emptive strikes against a federal legislative proposal that would allow unions to organize workers by relying on sign - up cards instead of secret ballots , the proposed @entity63 would allow unions to organize workers with a " card check			2
" business groups have opposed this draft legislation because , they claim , employees could be coerced into checking yes on a card to unionize			0
workers rights groups say the proposed " majority sign - up " law would reduce opportunities for employers to threaten or fire workers wanting a union , said spokeswoman @entity86 of the advocacy group @entity87			0
meanwhile , @entity89 voters were projected to reject an anti-abortion amendment that would have defined a " person " as " every human being from the beginning of the biological development of that human being , " according to a @entity0 analysis of exit poll data			1
@entity45 and @entity99 voters passed a measure tuesday allowing residents to opt out of president @entity103 's federal health care reform and its requirement that people have insurance , according to a @entity0 projection based on an analysis of exit poll data			1
but in @entity89 , voters rejected a similar measure that would give voters the option of not participating in the federal health care reforms , including the insurance requirement , according to a @entity0 projection based on exit polling			1
the approvals were a rebuke of the administration 's controversial health care reforms			0
experts question whether such state laws could be implemented because they seek to pre-empt federal law , and the matter could eventually end up in court , said @entity127 , an elections analyst with the conference			0
voters in many states cast ballots on other controversial measures tuesday , including balancing budgets			2
in all , 37 states offered 160 ballot proposals , and the initiatives had no single unifying theme this november , unlike in 2004 and 2006 , when voters saw same - sex marriage dominate ballots , according to the @entity141			0
among its nine initiatives , @entity2 offered a proposition that could reduce government gridlock by lowering the minimum needed for the legislature to approve a state budget , making it a simple majority instead of a two - thirds majority			2
only two other states require two - thirds			0
among other controversial or interesting measures : under @entity155 question 1 , voters were projected by @entity0 to reject changing the official state name from " @entity155 and @entity157 " to simply " @entity155			1
" in the wake of scandal in the governor 's office , @entity159 voters approved a constitutional amendment ( @entity165 31 ) that will allow for a recall of a governor and a special election to choose a replacement -- a process that exists in 18 other states			0
for the measure to pass , the " yes " votes must total at least 60 percent of those voting on this question or a majority of those voting in the overall election			0
@entity45 voters were projected by @entity0 to approve @entity8 107 , which called for an affirmative action / discrimination ban			1
the amendment to the state constitution would prohibit the state from granting preferential treatment or discriminating against any individual or group on the basis of race , sex , skin color , ethnicity or national origin .			0
