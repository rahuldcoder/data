@entity1 sen. @entity0 announced thursday that she will not run for reelection in 2016 , setting up a big money political battle for her seat in the nation 's most populous state			1
@entity0 , the 74 - year - old @entity8 junior senator from @entity9 , said that she is not retiring from public life and will continue working on " the issues that i love " through her political action committee , @entity12 for a @entity14			1
@entity0 was first elected to the @entity15 in 1992			1
" i am never going to retire , " @entity0 said			1
" the work is too important			1
" @entity0 's decision sets off one of the most competitive races for a statewide seat in @entity9 's recent history , and the field to replace her began to shape up within hours			1
the state 's deep bench of @entity8 rising stars sets up the prospect of a fierce intra-party fight for the seat			1
multiple @entity8 on @entity28 have already expressed interest , with a source close to rep. @entity31 telling @entity2 she 's keeping the door open to a run but has no time frame for a decision			1
rep. @entity36 also said he would consider it in a statement , and called @entity0 an " outstanding senator and public servant			1
" " i have been asked by several people to consider the @entity15 because of my years of service in the @entity43 and having been elected statewide as lieutenant governor and @entity46 , along with executive experience in the @entity48			2
i will consider it , but my first duty is to the people of the 3rd @entity52 , " he said			0
others , still , have already taken themselves out of the running			0
@entity56 mayor @entity55 is n't interested , a spokesman said , and @entity59 mayor @entity58 , who is considered a strong contender for statewide office in the future , ruled himself out of the race in a statement thursday			0
" the first thing we should do today is thank senator @entity0 for being a powerful champion for our city , state and nation in the @entity15 , " @entity58 said in a statement			1
" i love my job and i love my city and i am committed to the work here			2
i will not run for sen. @entity0 's seat			1
" @entity9 @entity15 president @entity79 @entity78 also is n't interested , his spokesman said			0
all eyes have turned to @entity81			0
gen. @entity82 , lt. gov. @entity83 and former @entity59 mayor @entity84 , who all have deep fundraising bases in @entity9 and are seen as top contenders for the seat			0
none have commented on their interest in the race , though both @entity92 and @entity83 issued releases commending @entity0 for her decades of service			1
both @entity92 and @entity83 have expressed strong interest to their confidantes in running for the @entity15 seat , but both are also intrigued by the possibility of running for governor when @entity102 leaves office — setting up the possibility that they could work out a deal , particularly since they share the same political consultant , @entity9 - based strategist @entity107			2
in what was viewed as a tea leaf indicating that possibility , @entity92 took the surprise role of administering the oath to @entity83 on jan. 5 when he was sworn in for his second term as lieutenant governor			0
@entity9 sen. @entity114 told reporters in the @entity28 on thursday she thinks there 's " a high likelihood " that @entity83 and @entity84 will run , and that she 's heard of a few @entity118 members interested in the race as well			1
but she said @entity9 's jungle primary system — which pits all candidates , regardless of party , against each other in a first round of voting , with the top two vote - getters proceeding to a faceoff in november — makes it difficult to peg a frontrunner at this point			0
" it 's hard to predict how people do in that kind of race , " she said			0
@entity114 also noted that because of the size of the state , it 's important for candidates to coalesce support quickly			2
" most candidates do n't realize until they 've run how big the state is and how you have to reach people , " she said			2
" it really comes down to media , unfortunately			0
and that 's the part of it			0
" any of those potential candidates could face a formidable challenge from billionaire @entity152 , who spent $ 74 million — much of it his own money — trying to sway the midterm elections by engaging voters on climate change without much in the way of results			0
other possible contenders include treasurer @entity161 , secretary of state @entity162 and insurance commissioner @entity163			0
" every house member looks in the mirror and sees a @entity15 , " said @entity164 , executive director of the @entity166 at the @entity167			0
" so there are probably 52 members of @entity43 in @entity9 thinking about running for @entity0 's seat this morning			1
" while @entity9 remains a deep - blue state , and the @entity173 bench of candidates there is thin , @entity173 have floated the prospect of a wide field of @entity8 contenders splitting the party 's vote and allowing for a @entity173 to squeak through the primary to the general			1
but one of their top prospects , rep. @entity185 , is n't interested in the race , according to a source close to the congressman			0
he declined to comment on his plans for the race to reporters earlier , but knocked @entity0 , commenting that " the fact that she 's not running does n't change the fact it 's always been a vacant office			2
" neither rep. @entity197 nor businesswoman @entity198 will run , according to statements from their staff on thursday			2
a @entity173 coup there remains a long shot , and on thursday @entity205 chairman @entity204 thanked @entity0 for giving @entity8 enough time to line up a credible candidate			1
" i appreciate that @entity0 has made an early decision , giving us more than enough time to get behind a strong @entity8 candidate who will hold this seat , " he said , adding they 're " confident " they 'll reelect a @entity210 to the seat			1
@entity0 explained her decision to not seek re-election in a mock interview with her oldest grandson in a video posted to @entity221			1
the liberal senator added that she plans to help @entity8 ' 2016 candidate for president " make history			1
" @entity0 has said repeatedly that former secretary of state @entity226 should run for president and has fundraised for the @entity227			1
she also said she is committed to ensuring her @entity15 seat stays in the hands of progressive @entity8 and is , ultimately , anxious to return to @entity9			2
the unapologetic liberal was one of her party 's most outspoken advocates on environmental issues and routinely sparred with @entity173 as head of the @entity235			0
but she was also known for forging bipartisan relationships and compromises , and earned the respect of some of the @entity173 's most conservative members for her work on transportation and infrastructure issues			2
@entity118 minority leader @entity244 of @entity9 became emotional during a press conference on thursday when a reporter asked her about @entity0 's announcement			1
@entity244 was caught off guard by the question and had n't yet found out			1
" it 's funny -- she called me , she said she wanted to talk to me personally			0
i thought she wanted to maybe to have dinner tonight , " @entity244 said			2
" her leaving will be a great loss to the @entity43 , people of @entity9 , and to our country			0
" @entity244 called @entity0 , who is just under 5 feet tall " small in size , but a giant in terms of her contribution			1
" @entity244 on @entity0 retirement : ' what ? ' @entity0 emphasized that her age was not a factor in her decision , nor was the hyper - partisan environment that has dominated @entity1 in recent years			1
" when you stand up there and you fight to make sure there 's a strong middle class and you protect a woman 's right to choose and you fight for jobs and a clean environment ... all those things are a fight worth making , " @entity0 said in the video			1
she added that her age was " definitely not " a factor			0
" some people are old at 40 , some people are young at 80			0
i feel as young as i did when i got elected			0
i was in my 50s , " @entity0 said			2
@entity9 's senior sen. @entity114 , also a @entity210 , is the oldest current serving member of the @entity15			0
she has not announced her decision on running for reelection in 2018			1
@entity0 , who apparently has a fondness for rhymes , closed the " interview " with a few rhymes			2
" the @entity15 is the place where i 've always made my case			0
for families , for the planet and the human race			0
more than 20 years in a job i love , thanks to @entity9 and the lord above			0
so although i wont be working from my senate space and i wont ' be running in that next tough race			0
as long as there are issues and challenges and strife , i will never retire because that 's the meaning of my life			2

@entity0 announced her decision not to run for reelection in 2016 in a @entity221 video with her grandson
" i am never going to retire , " @entity0 said . " the work is too important . "
@entity0 said she will work to elect the @entity8 presidential candidate in 2016 and " make history . " she supports @entity316
