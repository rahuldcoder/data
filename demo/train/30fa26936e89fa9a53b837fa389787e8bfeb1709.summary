@entity0 , @entity1 -- first , you may be dazzled by her gentle smile			1
but then the obvious question comes to mind			0
am i sitting across a true leading woman or is her big brother actually calling the shots ? at @entity12 in @entity1 , i recently interviewed prime minister @entity13 -- a woman who has heard those questions -- and more -- before			1
she is @entity1 's elected leader , the country 's first female prime minister , and -- as i found out -- ready to fire back at her critics and defend her authority			1
in 2011 , and about ten weeks into her political career , she won a landslide victory to lead a country of 67 million people			1
just months into her political career , she was criticized for her handling of @entity1 's worst flooding crisis in more than 50 years			1
two years on , @entity13 says she has been making decisions based on her own experience and wants to be judged by her achievements			2
" you have a lot of key stakeholders , " @entity13 tells me			2
" so you have to make sure the stakeholders are happy			0
" she has raised the country 's minimum wage , helped pass a massive loan bill to overhaul @entity1 's transportation infrastructure , and also become the country 's first female defense minister -- a position she says she is uniquely qualified to handle because she is a woman			1
" males and females can do this role , " she says			0
" but females will be more concerned about the morale and the support , and building teamwork			0
" but more recently , protests have erupted in the nation 's capital amid opposition to a proposed amnesty bill			0
as part of a push for unity in the country , the government proposed an amnesty bill which includes a controversial amendment offering a reprieve for any politically - related offenses since january 1 2004			0
the public dissent -- which has seen thousands march through @entity0 's streets -- stems from the fact that the period specified in the bill includes the time her brother , former prime minister @entity67 was in power , reports the @entity69			1
it 's this family connection where the @entity1 prime minister has been unable to bridge the deep political divide in her country			1
@entity13 is the youngest sister of the charismatic and deeply polarizing former prime minister @entity67 who led the country for five years before the military removed him from power in 2006			1
even though @entity67 remains in exile , critics say he is still ruling through his sister			1
@entity13 concedes she has a close relationship with her brother , but insists she has always been independent , even though her brother at one point called her his " clone			1
" " clone means the same kind of thinking and management style , " she says			1
" it does n't mean reliance			0
" in the last two years , @entity13 has sought to prove herself and her leadership			2
" i think there is less criticism about this because if i 'm relying on him , i do n't think i could be so wise to handle the hard times , " she tells me			0
the @entity1 prime minister is under scrutiny not only because of the shadow of her older brother , but for everything from her number of trips abroad to her fashion choices			2
recently in @entity105 , she wore a @entity1 silk jacket that drew attention since it was stained by the flood waters of 2011			2
it generated a media debate about whether it was appropriate for @entity1 's prime minister to be seen wearing it			1
but @entity13 has also used the media to advance her own platform , including the launch of " @entity116 " -- a reality tv show out to empower young women			2
the show prompted a jab from @entity1 opposition leader @entity121 who made reference to a " @entity124			2
" while @entity121 later said the remark was not directed at a particular person , and not intended as an insult to women , @entity13 supporters called it sexist			0
@entity13 offered a neutral response : " i do n't want to interpret what he meant , but ... please give a chance for all ladies and @entity1 people			1
" our interview was only the second time @entity2 sat down with the @entity1 prime minister on camera			0
my local producer commented to me that @entity13 today , comes across as more media savvy , confident , and serene compared to two years ago when she first came to office			0
@entity13 may never fully leave the shadow of her brother let alone the scrutiny of her naysayers , but she appears to be a woman trying to make peace with her position			0
" people expect you to run the country with sincerity and hard effort to deliver what we promise to the people , " she says			0
cue that dazzling smile .			0

@entity13 became @entity1 's first female *pm* after a landslide victory in 2011
she 's the sister of country 's ousted leader @entity67 who critics say still calls the shots
she says they have *similar* management style , but she is not his " clone "
