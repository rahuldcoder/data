-- @entity1 might not be having his best year on the race track , but it 's been another notable year for the @entity4 competing in triathlon events			1
what started out as a way of keeping in physical and mental shape for the rigors of @entity10 has turned into serious hobby for the 2009 world champion , earning him -- at the age of 34 -- the distinction of being called the fittest man in the pit lane			0
in july , @entity1 hosted his third annual charitable triathlon at @entity18 in @entity19 , raising a " huge amount " for @entity20 , and last month he finished 11th out of 1,675 competitors and second in his age group at an @entity25 event in the @entity26			1
all of which makes @entity1 -- who is seventh in the @entity10 drivers ' championship with just one podium finish all season for his @entity33 team -- one of the most famous amateur triathletes in the world			1
but how does he measure up against the very best professionals ? earlier this month , before he jetted off for this weekend 's @entity38 , @entity1 was given the opportunity to find out when he was pitted against @entity41 triathlon stars @entity42 and @entity43 -- gold and bronze medalists at the @entity46 -- in a cycling , swimming and cognitive test			1
an afternoon of grueling activity was organized by the @entity51 ( @entity52 ) -- a multimillion - dollar sports science facility based in west @entity54 which specializes in physiology , nutrition , biochemistry and neuroscience			1
the center , set up by pharmaceuticals giant @entity60 , has forged partnerships with all three athletes and others including world no. 1 golfer @entity64			0
@entity1 is a big fan			1
" it 's got everything that we need and it makes a big difference to us as drivers , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" there is still so much to learn about the human body , nutrition and pushing yourself to the limit and getting the best out of yourself			0
in @entity10 we love technology -- so this sort of thing is great			0
" heat of battle @entity1 was paired off against 24 - year - old @entity43 in the cycling performance test in the @entity52 's @entity81 , where the temperature was set to 35 degrees @entity83 ) and 70 % humidity -- similar to conditions @entity1 can expect in @entity86			1
results showed that @entity1 initially responded to the heat better , maintaining a lower core temperature despite having to work harder at the beginning of the test			1
but overall , @entity43 was the clear winner , producing more power throughout , a lower core temperature in the end and a lower heart rate from start to finish			1
@entity43 was encouraged by the results as he and his older brother look towards the @entity101 in 2016 , where climatic conditions could be similarly sticky			1
" one thing we 've not been good at in the past is the heat , " @entity43 said			2
" so we 're trying to use the @entity52 to create a strategy to cope -- whether that 's drinking something beforehand or going somewhere hot beforehand			0
" in the swimming test against 26 - year - old @entity42 , @entity1 displayed good technique , maintaining a high position in the water and matching @entity43 for distance covered in meters per second			1
but he used more energy , completing 40 strokes a minute -- each one covering 1.66 meters -- whereas @entity42 averaged 37 strokes per minute , covering 1.80 meters each one			0
" i 'm miles away from those guys , " @entity1 conceded			2
" they are so much fitter -- this is their job -- but it 's good to see i 'm doing the right sorts of things in terms of my training			0
" on the button @entity1 was n't going to be outpaced in the cognition tests , though , and ended up trouncing his younger rivals in a series of tasks completed on a bespoke @entity134 app created by axon sports which assessed both reaction time and accuracy			1
in fact , @entity1 was one of the quickest and most accurate athletes ever tested at the @entity52 with an average reaction time across eight tasks of 613 milliseconds and no errors			1
by comparison , the best average @entity43 time was 748 milliseconds set by @entity43			2
it might be what you 'd expect from a man who drives a car at speeds of up to 220 mph ( 350 kph ) but @entity1 was reassured			2
" the reaction stuff is always interesting because , you know , i 'm 34 years old and people say , ' oh , i 'm sure he 's past his best , ' " he says			0
" to be fair , @entity155 ( who won his only world title at 36 ) had n't really started in @entity10 when he was my age			0
so , to show that i still have good reactions , i think that is something that you can help with a bit of training anyway			0
" @entity33 will be hoping that the partnership with @entity52 can pay dividends as cognitive training is officially rolled out for the pit crew next season			2
" these guys are working 24/7 nigh on four days around the race , " says @entity170 , @entity52 's general manager			0
" so anything you can do to get a little bit more efficiency and focus is good			0
" it 's about getting their nutrition , their sleep right so they can perform as well as the drivers can perform			0
" as for the remainder of this season , @entity1 is clearly not expecting miracles			2
" we are not going to challenge @entity188 for a win this year but we are making progress which is good to see ... we have direction , " he said			0
