-- who is @entity2 -- like , really ? that 's the question at the heart of a new documentary , " @entity10 , " which follows the lives of five @entity2 impersonators beyond the @entity9 season			1
in the literal sense , the answer the film provides is this : @entity2 is everyone who can supply the requisite beard and some @entity9 cheer			1
the @entity17 stand - ins the filmmakers follow are poor and rich and drunk and fat and kind and gross and sad and sweet			1
one smells like cookies ( it 's cologne )			2
one lives in a trailer park in central @entity25			2
one is a former pro wrestler who used to wear a leather mask and go by the name mankind as he fake - pummeled @entity30 - wearing men on national television			2
oh yeah , and one of them is gay			1
time for a sale on pitchforks at @entity37 , right ? maybe not			2
the anti-gay backlash to a gay @entity2 from @entity39 that you might have expected five years ago ( " on his lap ? " ) has n't materialized , or has n't much beyond what director @entity43 calls the " @entity2 police , " or @entity2 impersonators who want to maintain arbitrarily strict standards about what @entity2 can or ca n't be , on or off the sleigh			1
maybe that 's because the documentary is buzzing below the national radar for now			1
maybe it 's because it 's getting harder to be openly homophobic in public			0
or maybe , hopefully , it 's because this is @entity9 season 2014			2
@entity58 sales are reportedly down 11 %			0
airstrikes are flying over @entity60			0
but gay santas are totally inoffensive			2
no one ( that i 've seen ) is busy conflating gay men with pedophiles			2
few are questioning whether gay men should have a place in a highly commercialized , quasi-religious tradition			2
no one is rushing to fire @entity2 because of his sexual orientation			1
all of those arguments seem so trite these days -- to the point of irrelevance			0
sure , there are some utterly homophobic comments to be found online about " @entity10 , " which , full disclosure , was executive produced by @entity77 , who has a show on @entity0			1
just turn to the comments section of @entity81 , the cesspool of digital humanity , and you 'll find people with the true spirit of @entity9 beaming through their fingers as they type sentences like , " so , @entity89 * * makes his film debut ? how disgraceful ! we , as a society , have become too accepting of immoral lifestyles			0
" and @entity95 , the former pro wrestler who 's one of the santas in the documentary , told me he had to take a break from @entity2 message boards ( yes , those exist ) and @entity101 because of what he perceived to be a homophobic backslash to the film			1
" anyone who expressed shock or outrage -- and there were a lot of people expressing shock and outrage and deep concern -- were probably concerned about the revelation of a gay @entity2 and what that could mean to their community , " he said			1
but the documentary has a 3Â½ - star rating ( out of a possible 5 ) on @entity119			2
one reviewer , @entity120 from @entity121 , writes that he " sat down to watch the movie as @entity123 , and eventually melted into @entity124			0
" and search social media and you 'll find stuff like this tweet : " @entity2 from ' i am @entity17 ' is my new favourite person			1
" i 'm heartened by that , and i have to agree			0
@entity2 's name is @entity131			1
he 's in his 70s			0
@entity133 : nipple - length			0
he loves being @entity2 because he does n't have kids and it gives him a chance to contribute			1
" i personally never have had a problem with a straight person about being gay and being @entity2 , " he says in the film			1
" i 've never been admonished for that			0
i 've never been questioned			0
i 've never -- it 's just never come up			0
" the documentary shows @entity131 kissing his boyfriend on a @entity146 , dealing antiques in a @entity39 store and posing for photos in his underwear ( he does that , apparently )			2
another @entity2 who makes a brief appearance in the film is a swinger who goes to sex clubs			1
yes , the idea of @entity2 having sex -- at all , with anyone -- is strange			1
but does it disqualify him from spreading @entity9 cheer ? it should n't			0
( reminder to all kids in the audience , these are stand - in , actor @entity168			0
not the real deal )			0
in one scene , two of the non-gay @entity168 consider the bounds of who should be an acceptable @entity2 impersonator			1
those bounds , in my view , should include pretty much everyone who is n't a criminal -- anyone who is n't dangerous to children			0
@entity95 , the former pro wrestler , said essentially the same			0
" i believe we 've had women posed as male santas , " he said			0
" i graduated @entity17 school with a very good @entity186 @entity2			1
he points out ... who better to work on christmas day ? " in @entity188 , a beloved @entity2 was fired this week , according to @entity189 , possibly because he is older than 70			1
there 's already an online petition calling for his reinstatement			0
i have a feeling the same would happen if a gay @entity2 were fired here in the @entity196 -- even if most state laws would n't protect his right to not be fired because he 's gay			1
the most important @entity2 requirement , as outlined in the bylaws of the @entity201 ( again , real ) , is that stand - in santas " endeavor to foster a reverence for the spirit of @entity9 & respect for all children , without regard to race , creed or religious denomination			1
" makes sense to me			0
as does the required background check			0
otherwise , it 's 2014			2
disagree ? it 's time to get over it .			0

new documentary , " @entity10 , " features a gay @entity2
others have *focused* on an anti-gay backlash , but @entity221 says that *reaction* is *overblown*
@entity221 : this is 2014 and @entity196 is ready for a gay @entity17
