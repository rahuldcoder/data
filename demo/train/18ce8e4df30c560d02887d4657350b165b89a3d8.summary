@entity1 and @entity3 football star @entity0 has called on the media to be more respectful in its attitude towards religion after the @entity9 attack			1
twelve people were killed by brothers @entity11 and @entity13 at the @entity16 satirical magazine 's offices last week , with the gunmen reportedly yelling , " we have avenged the @entity19 " while carrying out the attack			2
while @entity0 -- a @entity20 himself -- advocates freedom of speech , he feels news outlets also have responsibilities			1
" as a muslim i always believe in the way people can say what they want to say , " he told @entity2 's @entity25			2
" but for me , the most important thing is that we know something that sometimes the newspaper is doing a lot -- and they 're trying to do too much , and sometimes they do it not with respect			2
" " everybody has his point of view -- everybody has something to say about that , " @entity0 added			1
" of course it 's a newspaper trying to say something			0
but sometimes it hurts people			0
" depicting @entity43 is offensive to many @entity44 and the magazine 's past cartoons of the prophet apparently motivated the attackers in last week 's slaughter			0
the @entity1 midfielder says he was disappointed to hear of the attack on @entity9 -- and he now fears for the safety of his @entity20 friends in the @entity16 capital			1
currently on international duty with @entity3 ahead of the @entity56 which begins this week , @entity0 spent a season playing in the @entity16 @entity58 with @entity59 in 2006 - 07			1
" when you hear something like that it 's a bit disappointing , " he said , referring to the attack on the @entity9 office			0
" i feel very sorry for the families -- they lost their friend , father , or their husband , you know			0
" of course i have a friend in @entity71 , i have people who i work with			1
you get a bit confused , a bit afraid , because , as a @entity20 , i have a friend and they are @entity20 as well and i 'm afraid of what is going to happen			2
" the latest @entity9 issue has also been highly controversial , largely because on its cover is an illustration of a tearful @entity43 , holding up an " i am @entity82 " sign accompanied by the words " all is forgiven			0
" the new cover was met with mixed emotions -- with some calling it a bold example of free speech and others criticizing it as needlessly offensive to @entity44 .			0
