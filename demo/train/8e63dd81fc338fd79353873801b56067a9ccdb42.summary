@entity0 laid out the next step of its @entity3 effort on thursday by introducing a thin , light , @entity5 - built laptop attached to a killer number — $ 250			1
" it 's the best laptop that 's ever been designed at this price , " said @entity7 , who oversees @entity0 's @entity8 , os and product teams			1
" we assume that you have a @entity16 machine in your home , or maybe a @entity18 is n't built to replace those machines but instead be an additional computer			2
" the same way a tablet or smartphone are for many today			0
with that in mind , the performance and specs of the latest @entity3 ( officially called the new @entity3 ) fall just a bit below that of the mid-range $ 450 @entity31 launched in may			1
for example , the new @entity3 uses a @entity34 dual - core arm processor — essentially a chip designed for use in smartphones and tablets rather than traditional laptops — along with @entity40 of @entity41 and @entity42 of built - in storage			1
the @entity31 had @entity44 of @entity41			0
@entity0 is also giving @entity3 buyers @entity46 of free @entity48 storage for two years , so they can store files in the cloud , rather than locally on the device			1
the new @entity3 is available for pre-order on @entity53 starting thursday and officially goes on sale monday			1
@entity0 is setting up 500 " @entity65 " kiosks in @entity57 stores , staffed by @entity0 employees , to give consumers a chance to use @entity61 , ask questions , and see what the low - priced computer line is all about			1
the new @entity3 will also be sold in @entity66 , alongside @entity68 phones and tablets			1
" we really want this to be for everyone in your family , " @entity7 said			0
" we really want users to think about this as one extra computer for your kitchen counter , one near the bed , maybe a computer for your kids or family			0
" the new @entity3 has a full - sized keyboard and trackpad and an 11.6 - inch matte display with a 1366 x 768 resolution , versus the 12.1 - inch , 1280 x 800 display found on the @entity31			1
the previous @entity3 offered two usb ports and a single @entity89 + + connection that could be used with @entity91 , @entity92 and vga to hookup to tvs or external monitors			2
the new @entity3 also has two usb ports but ditches @entity89 + + for straight - up hdmi			2
but the main feature , aside from price , is the new @entity3 's profile			2
at just 2.5 pounds and 0.8 inches thick , this is one of the lightest and thinnest laptops on the market			0
it has no fan and or other moving parts — just like your smartphone or tablet			0
" at @entity0 , our goal is services which are used by hundreds of millions of people , gmail , maps , hangouts , " @entity7 said			2
" this is a big step in the journey for us			0
from the inception of the project we 've had this goal to provide a thin , light computer that is perfect for everyone			2
" keyboard - equipped computers need to be , and can be , more accessible , he said , pointing out that although about 85 percent of @entity127 households have multiple tvs , 50 percent of them have only one computer			0
so the $ 249 @entity3 is @entity0 's most accessible @entity3 , a category that so far has mostly been a toy / tool for early adopters and about 1,000 schools			1
so why buy a $ 249 @entity3 over a $ 200 @entity68 tablet ? @entity7 said that while tablets take care of quick , casual computing for most people — checking e-mail , using social media apps , maybe watching a movie or video chatting with a friend — the world still has a need for low - priced computers with a keyboard			1
" we , today , see a huge need for computing which is very usable with keyboards , " he said			0
" i see it in my house with my kids			0
my daughter has a tablet , but when she wants to do her homework , she needs a keyboard			0
she does n't want to do that on a tablet			0
