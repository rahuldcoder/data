-- draped in a white shroud , the body of a man is engulfed in flames atop a massive pile of wood , the insatiable fire churning out ashes for hours			2
a few yards away , a group of mourners chants prayers as the stench of burning flesh guides a billowing cloud of black smoke high into the @entity17 sky			1
this is a traditional @entity19 funeral pyre -- an ancient ritual that goes back thousands of years in which devotees cremate bodies by burning firewood in an open ground			1
" the smoke is all around the ground , " said @entity26 , a 31 - year - old iron merchant who recently attended the final rites of his uncle at a cremation ground in the city of @entity33 in the north @entity17 state of @entity35			1
" there is a lot of consumption of wood , " he added			2
and it 's because of this that these ceremonies , designed to release the soul from mortal flesh , pose a threat to the living , according to some environmentalists			2
fifty to 60 million trees are burned during cremations every year in @entity17 , according to @entity52 , a @entity54 - based @entity53 working to reduce the environmental impact of funeral pyres			1
" when you are burning those trees , you are emitting about eight million tonnes of carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions , " said @entity58 director @entity57			2
air pollution and deforestation are not the only environmental threats caused by cremation : they also generate large quantities of ash , which are later thrown into rivers , adding to the toxicity of their waters , according to @entity52			1
more than seven million @entity19 die each year in @entity17 and the sight of corpses surrendering to the flames of traditional funeral pyres is part of the country 's daily cycle of life			1
@entity54 has about 400 traditional cremation grounds , while @entity83 has around 300 , according to @entity52			1
in order to tackle the environmental problems stemming from these sites , the @entity17 government and environmental groups have , over the years , promoted the use of electric systems as an alternate way of cremation			1
but these systems , which burn no wood and generate no smoke , have by - and - large failed , mainly due to financial and religious reasons			0
they were expensive to run but , crucially , traditional rituals -- such as kapal kriya , where a stick or long bamboo pole is used to crack open the burning skull to free soul from its earthly existence -- were impossible			0
@entity52 , however , claims it has created an alternative system that addresses these problems : it says its affordable , energy - efficient " @entity113 " generates minimum air and water pollution , while taking into consideration the religious needs of @entity19			1
the wood - based system consists of a man - sized grate beneath a roof and a chimney , which reduces heat loss			1
the wood is placed on the metal base , which enables better air circulation around the flames			0
@entity57 says the benefits are manifold : it takes up to two hours and 150 - 200 kilograms of wood to burn a body completely , while a traditional pyre takes six hours and burns 500 - 600 kilograms of wood			2
as a result , he says , the cost is reduced significantly and emissions are cut by up to 60 %			1
@entity134 , director of the @entity136 - based @entity135 , which looks at the religion in contemporary society , says such initiatives have a positive impact on the wider community			0
he said : " all these are welcome moves because this is hanging on to tradition as well as making sure the environment is safeguarded			0
" there are many such institutions in @entity17 that are trying to be environmental - friendly and also of course if you can do it in a more economical way it will be cheaper for the families , so it benefits everybody			2
" for @entity26 , who attended a cremation using @entity58 's innovation about two months ago , one of the big advantages of this system is that mourners can continue to fulfill all traditional rites			2
" it has such kind of quality , " he said			0
" it allows us to perform all the rituals			0
" @entity52 , which began operations in 1992 , says it has installed 42 units across the country , mainly in urban areas , and plans to increase the number to 50 by next year			1
yet , the group 's expansion has not been without issues : @entity57 says @entity52 is facing problems from the " wood mafia " -- people illegally cutting down trees to sell for funeral pyres			1
" they even go to the extent of threatening our people , " said @entity57			0
" if they ( our people ) go to install and promote these systems we get threatening calls : ' you do n't come in our city , do n't put up these systems or we will hunt you			0
' " but despite the challenges , the group says it is optimistic about the future			0
it has convinced the government to come forward and provide funding and also engaged the corporate sector to help install its green cremation units under their corporate social responsibility plan			0
so far , @entity52 has surveyed over 2,000 cremation grounds across @entity17 and has conducted seminars and workshops , asking people for feedback so they can improve their system			1
" we are now promoting it on a larger scale , " said @entity57			0
" it has the sentiments and the feelings of the people at heart , so we have taken their feedback , their views on how it has to be developed and how it can be promoted			0
" while we are doing the rituals for the dead , we should take care that we 're not affecting the survival of future generations			0
