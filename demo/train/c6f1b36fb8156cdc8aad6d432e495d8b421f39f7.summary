a group of current and former soccer players has filed a lawsuit against @entity3 , claiming football 's world governing body is n't doing enough to manage the issue of concussion in the game			1
the action , which is also targeted at @entity11 , @entity12 and others , alleges these groups have " failed to adopt effective policies to evaluate and manage concussions			1
" it also claims women and children are put in danger by a lack of adequate rules to manage concussion as they are " more vulnerable to traumatic and long - lasting brain injury			1
" the lawsuit seeks no financial damages and instead is insisting on rule changes it has been suggesting for over a decade			0
the plaintiffs , which include @entity30 -- a former youth club soccer player -- and several parents on behalf of their children in youth soccer leagues , are led by attorney @entity35			2
" despite simple , best - practice guidelines , which have been updated three times since the initial international conference on concussions , @entity3 has failed to enact the policies and rules needed to protect soccer players , " he said in a statement sent to @entity37 by his firm @entity35			1
" we believe it is imperative we force these organizations to put a stop to hazardous practices that put players at unnecessary risk			0
" the negligence is remarkable , given that @entity3 actively promotes its activities to children			1
yet no rule limits headers in children 's soccer , and children are often taught to head the ball from the age of three			0
" we estimate that a dedicated youth player might sustain 1,000 headers per year , and a high school player more than 1,800 headers			0
" the lawsuit , filed in @entity66 , claims @entity3 guidelines appear to suggest it is referees and players who diagnose brain injuries and not medical professionals			1
it wants provision made for temporary substitutions to be allowed when a player is being examined for a brain injury , above the permitted three per match , and a limit on how many times players under 17 can head the ball			0
concussion has become a hot topic in major sports in the @entity85 with the @entity86 , the @entity87 and the @entity88 all involved in litigation			1
in 2013 , the @entity86 struck a deal worth $ 765 million to fund medical exams , concussion - related compensation , medical research for retired @entity86 players and their families , as well as litigation expenses			0
currently , any player who is knocked out or concussed during an @entity86 match is removed from the game , but no such rules exist in soccer			2
according to @entity3 's most recent newsletter , there were five incidents of concussion at the recent @entity106 in @entity107 , including one in the final between @entity109 and @entity110			1
@entity112 midfielder @entity111 received medical treatment after being knocked out but returned to the field of play			1
he was substituted a short time later after he asked : " is this the final ? " the newsletter reported			0
@entity3 president @entity118 said in the newsletter that the topic of concussion in football has the " highest priority			1
" " the decisive factor is how those involved react to this kind of incident , " @entity118 wrote of the @entity111 injury			1
" the @entity112 team doctors assessed the situation correctly			2
@entity111 initially showed no symptoms of concussion , but a little later he realized something was wrong and asked to be substituted			1
" coach @entity133 did not hesitate even for a moment , sending out an important signal and demonstrating that the player 's health and the doctors ' opinion matter more than sporting considerations			0
" that is fully in line with the principle : " when in doubt , sit them out "			0
this topic has the highest priority for @entity3			1
" when contacted by @entity37 , @entity3 said it had not received anything regarding the lawsuit and , as such , was not in a position to comment , but it did offer a statement outlining its work on the issue			2
" @entity3 has always assigned high priority to the topic of prevention and treatment of head injuries , " it read			1
" together with other leading sports federations @entity3 initiated 12 years ago discussions on this topic which led to four scientific consensus meetings and the development of clear recommendations			1
" @entity3 has also initiated a series of scientific studies related to head injuries in football that have resulted in modifications to the @entity168			2
" for instance , in 2006 , the @entity169 ( the @entity169 ) adapted the @entity168 to punish incidents which cause concussion such as an elbow to the head with a red card			0
this led to a significant decrease in such incidents and head injuries			0
" for @entity3 competitions , all team doctors are fully informed about these recommendations			2
it is the responsibility of each team doctor and any support staff in their team to decide whether or not a player can continue playing			0
" the organization is running a pilot in the @entity191 first division this season to better monitor players ' cognitive abilities and to help with swift diagnosis of brain injuries			0
it will be supervised by @entity3 's chief medical officer professor @entity197 , who told the newsletter : " in parallel with this research , we must -- sooner rather than later -- also discuss an additional substitution			2
" that would give coaches greater personal leeway , as they could react more quickly and decisively in the case of injury			0
" the @entity208 announced prior to the start of the new season it had introduced new regulations regarding head injuries			0
it said the final rulings on head injuries would be made by the medical professionals present and insisted a new " tunnel doctor " attended each match to assist the doctors already attached to the competing teams .			0
