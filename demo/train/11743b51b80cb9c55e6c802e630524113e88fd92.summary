@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , a young @entity1 wife whose ears and nose were cut off by her husband , is heading to the @entity7 on wednesday for reconstructive surgery			1
@entity3 made headlines and was on a recent cover of @entity11 , showing the plight of women in @entity1			1
" when they cut off my nose and ears , i passed out , " @entity3 said , describing the attack			1
" it felt like there was cold water in my nose			0
i opened my eyes , and i could n't even see because of all the blood			0
with the help of an @entity7 provincial reconstruction team in @entity27 province and the organization @entity28 , she finally received the help and protection she needed			0
and now she is on her way to the @entity7 , where the @entity32 will provide her with reconstructive surgery and a new life			1
read a behind - the - scenes with @entity3 then and now @entity3 says her mutilation was an act of @entity39 justice for the crime of shaming her husband 's family			1
at 16 , she was handed over to her husband 's father and 10 brothers , who she claims were all members of the @entity39 in @entity27			2
" i spent two years with them and became a prisoner , " she said			0
read more about @entity3 's story she eventually ran away but was caught by police in @entity51			2
and although running away is not a crime , in places throughout @entity1 , it is treated as one if you are a woman			2
eventually her father - in - law found her and took her back to her abusive home			0
she was taken to a @entity39 court for dishonoring her husband 's family and bringing them shame			2
the court ruled that her nose and ears must be cut off , an act carried out by her husband in the mountains of @entity27 , where they left her to die			2
after @entity3 's story was exposed to the world through various news organizations , offers of help poured in			2
but there are many more women still suffering			0
the @entity74 estimates that nearly 90 percent of @entity1 's women face some sort of domestic abuse			1
this in a country where there are fewer than a dozen women 's shelters providing sanctuary from the cruelty they face			0
and all of them are privately run			0
" @entity3 is only one example of thousands of girls and women in @entity1 and throughout the world who are treated this way			1
who suffer abuses like this -- like this and worse , " @entity28 board member @entity92 said			0
in 2001 , the situation of @entity1 women and @entity39 brutality received lots of attention			1
now , organizations like @entity28 say , the international community is strangely silent on the issue			0
and with the @entity1 government 's plans to negotiate with some of the @entity39 -- supported by many in the international community -- many fear that it will be the women who will pay the price			1
@entity92 says that not enough is being done to help the women in @entity1 , and that feeds into the hands of the @entity39			1
@entity3 is reminded of that every time she looks in the mirror			0
but at least now she will be going to the @entity7 for a chance at a new life			0
and just like the iconic picture of an @entity1 girl on a 1985 @entity123 cover brought the plight of @entity1 women under @entity127 oppression to the world 's attention , many hope @entity3 's face can show the new plight under the @entity39 .			1

the @entity1 woman whose ears and nose were cut off is heading to the @entity7
she 's planning on reconstructive surgery in @entity139
some look to @entity3 to help show the plight of women under the @entity39
