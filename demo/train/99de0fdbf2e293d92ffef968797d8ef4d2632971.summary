it sounds like an episode from a 1980s tv police drama : a wealthy businessman claims he was framed for two @entity5 murders allegedly ordered by @entity7 drug lord @entity6			1
nearly 30 years ago , international food importer and newspaper owner @entity8 , a @entity10 citizen , was living the good life in @entity12			1
he had owned luxury cars and horses that raced against thoroughbreds held by @entity16 then , in october 1986 , police arrested @entity8 in the shooting deaths of his business partners @entity20 and his 23 - year - old son @entity21			1
despite having an alibi , @entity8 was charged with murdering the @entity23 because they allegedly had cheated him out of more than $ 400,000			1
he was found guilty and sentenced to death -- a penalty that was later reduced to life in prison			2
and there @entity8 has remained for 27 years			1
then , in april this year , a @entity12 judge granted @entity8 a chance that could open the door to freedom			1
@entity12 11th judicial circuit judge @entity34 held a hearing in november to determine if new evidence from @entity8 's lawyers " undermines confidence in the verdict , " according to court documents			1
defense attorneys also must establish that the new " evidence would probably produce an acquittal or less severe sentence on retrial			2
" @entity8 's lawyers said evidence suggests that the murders were committed by former members of @entity6 's infamous drug cartel			1
in the late 1970s and early ' 80s , @entity6 cashed in on the exploding popularity of cocaine in the @entity52 , according to reporter @entity53 , author of " @entity54			1
" leading the @entity55 , @entity6 was responsible at one point for almost 80 % of @entity7 's cocaine exports , making him the seventh richest man in the world , @entity53 told @entity60			1
@entity6 was killed in a rooftop shootout with authorities in 1993			1
according to a motion filed in january by @entity8 's attorneys , a " @entity7 drug cartel member confirmed that the @entity65 murders were committed at the behest of @entity6			1
" " the @entity69 were laundering money for the @entity7 cartels , " the defense motion said			2
" this is what precipitated their murders			0
" an ex-cartel member confirmed that " @entity8 was not involved in the murders of the @entity69 , and that they had to be eliminated because they had lost @entity7 drug money , " according to the defense motion			1
" we 've got several @entity7 cartel people to say , ' we did the murders , ' " @entity8 defense attorney @entity80 told @entity60 on the phone in june			1
read the full defense motion document the defense team also alleges @entity12 prosecutors covered up evidence in the 1987 trial that could have proved @entity8 's innocence			1
although prosecutors said they stand by the decades - old case , in a june e-mail to @entity60 , a state attorney spokesman wrote , " now that we are re-engaged in litigation on this matter , it would be inappropriate for us to be commenting at this time			1
" prior to the hearing , strongly worded arguments flew back and forth via filed court documents			0
in january assistant state attorneys @entity102 and @entity103 wrote that a defense motion for the new hearing was based on " hearsay and inadmissible evidence			2
" " none of [ the potential witnesses named in the defense motion ] have any first hand knowledge , provide no admissible testimony or evidence and only attempt to further the nonsensical and wholly speculative theories of the defense , " the prosecution document said			2
" the only thing that is obvious to anyone who really looks at these fantastical allegations by the defendant is that they are empty and have no substance , " wrote the prosecutors			2
read the full prosecution document now aged 75 , @entity8 has been in poor health , @entity80 said , although he seems to have improved			1
" when we got this hearing , and when we started learning about these @entity7 witnesses who were corroborating his innocence , @entity128 really cheered up , " said @entity80			0
" i think he 's now trying to walk more and not use his wheel chair and so forth			2
" local tv news video at the november hearing showed @entity8 in the courtroom appearing upbeat			2
he offered a thumbs - up to family members and other supporters			0
defense attorney @entity138 said the " circumstances of this crime were not as presented to the jury by the prosecution , " reported @entity5 tv station @entity143			2
prosecutor @entity102 reportedly countered , " i have n't heard one thing from the defense that indicates that this is admissible evidence			0
" in the wake of the hearing , judge @entity34 is expected to set a court date when he could issue a ruling			0
but the odds are stacked against @entity8			2
the burden of proof is high			0
@entity12 's @entity154 has already upheld his conviction			0
@entity20 's daughter was asked in 2007 about continued efforts to exonerate @entity8			1
" it 's all been hashed out before , " she told the @entity158			0
" it 's a waste of tax dollars			0
" prosecutors ' evidence against @entity8 is significant			1
police found @entity8 's fingerprints in the guest room at @entity5 's @entity166 where the shootings occurred			1
@entity8 says he was there for a meeting , but he departed before the @entity170 were killed			1
nineteen fingerprints found at the crime scene have never been identified , according to the defense motion			0
@entity8 told @entity60 's " @entity179 " that he left the hotel and drove 25 miles to @entity175 to have lunch with one of his newspaper employees			1
the employee signed an affidavit as an alibi witness			0
the restaurant manager , @entity183 , told " death row stories , " he remembered seeing @entity8 having lunch that day			2
" it does n't seem like there 's any way possible that he could have killed people at 12 o'clock and then been in for lunch sometime between 12 and 2 , " @entity183 said			2
five other witnesses came forward saying @entity8 was with them on the day of the murders , " @entity179 " reported			2
across the hall from the murder scene at the time of the killings , said the defense team , was a @entity7 hotel guest named @entity198			0
police briefly questioned @entity198 at the time , according to defense documents			0
he was a " longtime money launderer who was frequently in @entity5 , " the documents said			1
more recently , defense lawyers said in the documents , they had been " able to establish that [ @entity198 ] was a senior cartel operative			0
" during his entire imprisonment , @entity8 's wife @entity206 has been working to keep her husband 's confidence high , said @entity80			1
it 's important to her that @entity8 believes he will eventually be exonerated			1
" she is his rock , " @entity80 said			0
" they talk every day on the phone ... and she goes to see him every sunday			0
" earlier this year , @entity206 wrote in the @entity216 , " i pretend to myself that @entity128 is traveling			0
when i have five minutes on the phone with him in the evening , i pretend to myself that he is talking to me from a trip , not from a cell			0
" @entity80 sees @entity8 quite often lately at a medium security correctional facility outside @entity5			1
authorities allow them to sit together at a table in a largely empty room with a guard watching nearby			0
" i do n't think there 's a case that 's quite as absolute as @entity128 ' , " said @entity80			0
" i mean we 've got an alibi â€” we 've got everything			0
it 's just really shocking			0
" @entity80 admits he 's become " obsessed " with freeing his client -- partially because of guilt			0
" i 've represented the guy for 20 years and i failed him			0
and it really makes you think , ' how on @entity238 could you lose a case like this ? ' " virtually penniless , @entity8 faces financial challenges as well as health issues			2
" if he gets out , he 'll probably go back to @entity10 and set up another business , " said @entity80			0
" @entity128 is fairly unstoppable			0
