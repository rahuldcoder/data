-- an education department in one @entity3 state is sending effeminate boys to a boot camp to change their behavior , a move that 's drawn fire from educators and activists			1
the @entity12 state @entity13 picked 66 boys for the camp this month , part of a program to help boys deal with identity crises , media in the @entity22 nation reported			1
the camp offers physical training and other activities and is designed to prevent the boys from developing feminine traits , @entity24 newspaper reported , quoting @entity30 , the education department 's director			1
" the boys involved were selected from most schools in the state , " @entity30 is quoted as saying			1
" they were carefully vetted before a final selection was made			2
" @entity30 said there could be big problems for such boys if their behavior was not addressed			1
he cited a couple of factors contributing to the issue -- parents dressing boys in girl 's clothing " as they had really wanted a girl " or boys " surrounded by female siblings			1
" the move smacks of homophobia to many			1
@entity52 , deputy director of the @entity53 at @entity54 , deplored the action , which " feeds into gender stereotyping and homophobia			2
" @entity3 is a state party to the convention on the elimination of @entity61 , and an article in that convention calls on countries to ensure that gender stereotyping does not occur , she said			1
" starting a re-education camp or boot camp is directly counter to that			1
it goes to encouraging discrimination against all people because of their sexual orientation			2
" @entity52 also noted that homosexuality is illegal in @entity3			2
" @entity54 would oppose that and urges the government to repeal those provisions in the law , " she said , adding that " anyone who is arrested merely for being gay we would consider as prisoners of conscience , they should be released immediately non-conditionally			0
" @entity3 's @entity83 datuk seri @entity84 said the ministry views the move with " alarm and great concern " and said such boot camps should be abolished			1
" the experience of being singled out on the basis of perceived characteristics is an extremely traumatizing experience , in particular for adolescent teens			0
such profiling has potentially serious psychological repercussions and could harm the development and mental health of the children , as it exposes them to prejudices among their peers and members of their family and community , " she said			0
she said the camps violate the @entity106 , which says " every child is entitled to protection and assistance in all circumstances without regard to distinction of any kind , such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , social origin or physical , mental or emotional disabilities or any other status			1
" the @entity123 for @entity124 , a coalition of @entity3 organizations , said it was appalled at the move , noting that " identifying and singling out boys who behave effeminately is highly discriminatory bordering on predatory			1
" it said the department is undermining the role of education -- nurturing " the personality and talents of the child " and inculcating " respect for human rights in preparation for responsible adulthood			0
" and it said fashioning a criterion for so - called normal behavior " is highly questionable			0
" " the boys in this case have been denied and persecuted for the expression of their personalities and identities			2
ideally , school is supposed to provide a safe and neutral space for children to develop without fear of recrimination for being themselves , " the group said			0
it added that the children in question were n't -- but should have been -- consulted			0
" corrective boot camps to ' fix ' children and individuals must not be condoned because it violates the rights of people who are perceived as ' different			1
' it should be strongly opposed and challenged as it promotes homophobia and prejudice			0
we should send a clear message to institutions that they have no business meddling with an individual 's identity and personal preference , " the group said			0
@entity178 , director of the @entity180 's @entity179 and a professional social worker , said it is " heartbreaking that young men are being forced into ' masculinity camps ' simply because some adults do n't think they are masculine enough			2
" the group is an advocate for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender rights			0
" it is irresponsible for adults -- particularly parents -- to shame and punish their children for who they are			0
these attempts to change children only cause emotional harm and distress			0
we should heed the advice of @entity202 , and the @entity203 , among other experts , and provide love , support and affirmation to our children regardless of their gender expression or sexual orientation			0
" @entity0 's @entity211 contributed to this report			0

the boys are from @entity12 state
the move has touched a nerve for many
one official said such boot camps should be abolished
