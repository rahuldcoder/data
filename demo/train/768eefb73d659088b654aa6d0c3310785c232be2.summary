-- the $ 1 billion patent dispute between @entity2 and @entity3 picked back up in federal court in @entity5 on thursday , with both sides arguing over issues of damages amounts , bans on product sales and allegations of dishonesty on the part of the jury foreman			1
in august , a nine - person jury awarded @entity2 just more than $ 1 billion in damages from @entity3 after three weeks of complicated and technical testimony			1
the jurors found that @entity3 copied the @entity19 and @entity20 designs for its own smartphone and tablet models , and calculated the damages amount using 109 pages of jury instructions and a 20 - page verdict form			1
now @entity2 is pushing to increase the amount of damages it was awarded by several hundred million dollars , and to ban @entity3 from selling certain products that infringe on @entity2 patents			1
@entity3 is fighting to chip away at the enormous settlement amount or to have it thrown out			1
as part of its strategy , the @entity35 company is asking for a new trial , alleging that the foreman of the jury was willfully dishonest by not divulging he was sued by his former employer in 1993 , a company in which @entity3 had invested			1
judge @entity42 did n't make any rulings on the various post-trial motions on thursday , but said she plans to issue the orders separately over the next month			2
a protracted legal battle after a jury verdict is not unusual in a case this large and complicated , and was expected by legal experts			0
" it shows that there is a careful process ; the judge does get to review what the jury has done , " says law professor @entity50 of the @entity51			0
each side is armed with impressive and expensive legal teams that are also fighting smaller battles in other countries			0
while those legal costs are likely astronomical , they are dwarfed by what 's at stake : a global smartphone market that is expected to be worth $ 150 billion by 2014			2
currently , only 50 % of mobile phones in the world are smartphones , which means there 's a huge untapped market of potential smartphone customers			0
the judge urged both sides to reach a settlement , claiming it was best for consumers , the industry and both parties			0
" i think it 's time for global peace , " she said			0
however , a settlement still looks unlikely at this point -- both parties were made to meet before the trial began to discuss a settlement but nothing came of it			0
in court on thursday , @entity3 indicated it was willing to reach an agreement , saying the ball was in @entity2 's court			1
@entity2 , however , wanted more			2
it said the awarded damages , which are for past infringements , are not enough to discourage @entity3 from copying @entity2 patents in future smartphones and tablets			1
" the key issue is whether there 's going to be a permanent injunction			0
that 's probably the hardest thing for @entity2 to get , " said @entity50			2
he said the chance of a retrial was also very remote .			0
