it 's like finding a needle in a universe - wide haystack			0
researchers have located a planet roughly the size of @entity7 that could be habitable			1
designated @entity9 - 186f , the planet is 490 light - years away			2
but in the search for worlds similar to ours , nothing has come closer			1
" this is the first definitive @entity7 - sized planet found in the habitable zone around another star , " said @entity14 of the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) institute at @entity16			1
" finding such planets is a primary goal of the @entity9 space telescope			0
" " this discovery not only proves the existence of worlds that might be similar to our own but will undoubtedly shape future investigations of exoplanets that could have terrestrial surface environments , " the institute said in an announcement thursday			1
after spotting it , the institute wasted no time searching for emissions that could indicate the presence of @entity33			2
so far , no emissions have been found			0
the size -- estimated to be 10 % larger than @entity7 -- and distance from its star do n't just make for interesting factoids			1
they give scientists hope that @entity9 - 186f might sustain life as we know it			1
of nearly 1,800 " confirmed exoplanets " that have been found , approximately 20 orbit their host stars within habitable zones , where it 's believed surface water would not freeze or boil			0
in 2011 , @entity16 announced that @entity9 had observed five planets approximately the size of @entity7 and in the habitable zone			1
but the " previously discovered worlds are larger than @entity7 , and consequently their true nature -- rocky or gaseous -- is unknown , " the @entity53 said in a written announcement on thursday			1
" on the basis of the observed dimming of starlight from @entity61 , the authors estimate that this newly discovered planet is roughly the same size as the @entity7			1
" theoretical models and observations tell scientists that planets the size of @entity68 likely have a composition of iron , rock and ice , like @entity7 , @entity14 told reporters thursday			1
even if kepler - 186f is rocky , it 's not necessarily habitable , scientists warned thursday			2
first , a lot would depend on the atmosphere , if it has one , @entity77 of @entity16 's @entity9 mission said			0
and scientists right now do n't have the technology to know what the atmosphere is			0
the star 's size -- it 's an m - dwarf star , smaller and less hot than our sun -- also could come into play			0
because it is smaller , the habitable zone is closer , so radiation could prevent life if the atmosphere is n't dense enough , said @entity97 of the @entity99 @entity98			2
but the @entity102 space - based telescope , now under construction , should be able to gather images of planets around closer dwarf stars and study their atmospheres			0
scientists are especially keen about checking dwarf stars because their habitable planets are more easily detectable , and because they are the most abundant type of star in our galaxy , @entity77 said			2
for researchers , the discovery of @entity68 is like a beginning			0
it 's a first but " not a record we wish to keep , " @entity14 said			0
" we want to find more of these			0
" it 's likely they will			0
astronomers at the @entity122 , and the @entity123 , using data from @entity9 , estimate there are tens of billions of @entity7 - size , possibly habitable planets in our @entity128 galaxy .			1

researchers find an @entity7 - sized planet that may be habitable
it " proves the existence of worlds that might be similar to our own , " institute says
scientists are looking for emissions that could suggest *extraterrestrial* life
previously discovered worlds were larger than @entity7
