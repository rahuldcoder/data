-- @entity3 's @entity2 adventure may be over , but new age chanteuse @entity4 is one global export that in many ways echoes the @entity9 @entity2 fantasy of " @entity10			1
" @entity4 's music should find a home on the ipods of millions of chill - out world music fans			1
born to a @entity18 mother and @entity20 father , she sings in @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , and the rare dialect of @entity25 , while fusing chill - out beats and floaty instrumentation played on zither , horse head fiddle and bamboo flute			1
already hugely popular in @entity3 , she has been finding similar success farther afield : her first album sold 2 million copies in @entity34 , and she has appeared on @entity35			1
earlier this year she won a @entity36 as well as performing at the @entity37 in @entity38			2
her linguistic skills and musicianship were honed from a young age			2
born in @entity42 in 1983 , she spent three years until the age of 6 with her grandmother , living a nomadic life in northern @entity3 , where her imagination and creativity were allowed to roam free			1
" we actually lived in a small city between grassland and the big city			0
in spring time , we move to the grassland			0
and in winter time , we moved back to the city , " she told @entity0 's @entity54			0
" the whole memory of my childhood is in one word : play			0
i just played everywhere on the grassland			0
and there a lot of interesting things happened which affected the ... life of mine			0
" later she became a student of @entity68 and yoga as well as becoming a multi-instrumentalist , releasing her first album at the age of 18			2
melding different musical cultures and ethnic influences , notably @entity22 , has also caused a certain amount of discussion , especially on her own position toward the status of @entity79 within @entity3			1
" from a musician 's point of view , @entity22 culture and its music can not be seen as an isolated subject ... lots and lots of other ethnicities have added their colors on the @entity22 culture			2
so i see the @entity22 culture nowadays as an integral part of the greater @entity3 culture , " she said			1
aiming to avoid controversy , organizers of the @entity94 dropped her from this year 's lineup			1
" i do n't quite understand the reason behind [ it ]			0
to me , art and music really belong to the whole world and they should n't be limited by boundaries			0
so i really hope that i could join @entity94 next year , " she said			1
until then further explorations in language and music beckon , and there have been recent collaborations with house music dj @entity109 and @entity113 chill - out duo @entity111 in @entity114			1
" it 's very amazing because when i had to return to @entity3 , they drove me to the airport and told me : ' life is full of miracles			2
when you first arrived here , these three songs did n't exist			0
but now you 're leaving , and we have three wonderful new songs			0
