@entity0 -- more emotion , aggressive leadership overseas , fresh ideas and active bipartisanship : that 's the advice four former @entity8 chiefs of staff have for president @entity9 as he faces the possibility of a @entity12 - controlled @entity11 and crises around the world and at home			1
former @entity17 @entity16 , who worked for @entity9 from 2011 - 12 ; @entity18 from @entity19 's @entity8 ; @entity20 of the @entity22 administration ; and @entity23 , who worked for @entity24 , sat down with @entity25 on sunday on @entity1 's " @entity26			1
" all four agreed that the twilight years of a two - term presidency hold drawbacks as well as opportunities			2
a lame - duck president , they argue , has the opportunity to search for fresh ideas and focus on what the country wants instead of politics			1
@entity24 , @entity22 and @entity19 were able to overcome a narrative of their irrelevancy , according to @entity20			1
" i think there is a real opportunity as we 've seen in each of these presidencies for the last two years for a lame duck indeed to fly , and there 's such a demand and hunger by the @entity49 people for leadership to get something done			1
" scandals within the @entity53 , the @entity55 epidemic and the battle against @entity57 fill today 's headlines			0
it 's also been a rocky midterm season for @entity61 , with @entity9 's low approval ratings leading some @entity61 candidates to keep their distance			1
in response to critics who say the president has not showed enough leadership in facing these issues , @entity16 said that if @entity9 appears as if he 's phoning it in , it 's a misperception			1

you 've got to address them			0
it 's not as though you can take off , and he knows this better than anyone			0
" however , @entity18 pointed out that in politics , perceptions are paramount			0
" i think he 's got to be an aggressive and active leader in all of those categories -- and demonstrate some emotion and commitment that 's real			0
" @entity18 also warned the president away from appearing too consumed with partisan battles and to focus on leadership abroad			2
" he kind of stepped on it this past week by basically saying this election is really a referendum on him , " @entity18 said , referencing a line from the president 's speech thursday			2
" that message is not resonating with the @entity49 people			0
" both @entity18 and @entity20 agreed that the president 's focus on international leadership on the threat of @entity57 , @entity55 and relations with @entity107 is essential for a leader facing gridlock in @entity110			1
" he 's already built an international coalition			2
he 's already beginning to build the right pathway and demonstrate that leadership that the @entity49 people have such a strong desire for , " @entity20 said			0
dubersteinsaid the president has an opportunity to turn over a new leaf			0
" every two - term president needs some fresh ideas , fresh voices and strong people			2
" the panel also sounded notes of optimism , saying a new @entity110 might be just want the president needs			1
according to @entity23 , trade and tax reform will be attractive issues where @entity12 can show leadership			0
