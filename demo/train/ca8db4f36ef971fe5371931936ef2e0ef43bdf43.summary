-- the chairman of a @entity5 mission whose report accused @entity6 of " actions amounting to war crimes " during its fight against @entity15 says he would have reached different conclusions if the @entity6 military had been more forthcoming and if he had known the results of subsequent investigations			1
" if i had known then what i know now , the @entity20 would have been a different document , " wrote @entity16 , a former @entity17 jurist , in a @entity19 op - ed column friday			1
@entity6 , which has long been critical of the conclusions presented to the @entity24 on its war against @entity15 forces in @entity27 in 2008 - 09 , on saturday called for the body to cancel the findings			1
" everything we said has proven to be true , " said prime minister @entity30			0
" @entity6 did not intentionally harm civilians , its institutions and investigative bodies are worthy , while the @entity15 intentionally fired upon innocent civilians and did not examine anything			1
the fact that @entity16 backtracked must lead to the shelving of this report once and for all			0
" there was no immediate reaction from @entity15			2
@entity16 's report , issued in september 2009 , said both @entity6 and @entity15 likely committed war crimes and possible crimes against humanity during the conflict between december 27 , 2008 , and january 18 , 2009			1
@entity6 investigations found cases involving individual soldiers , but the intentional targeting of civilians by @entity6 was not a " matter of policy , " @entity16 now writes			2
@entity6 launched the offensive against @entity27 militants in response to ongoing firing of rockets against southern @entity6 towns			1
the @entity24 , which assigned @entity16 and others to the fact - finding mission , approved the controversial report , which focused more on alleged war crimes by @entity6			1
@entity6 later provided the @entity5 with a report justifying its actions			2
@entity6 said it faced " asymmetric conflicts " and blamed " militants operating from within and behind civilian areas " for placing civilians at risk			0
in his column , @entity16 cites a subsequent report by a @entity5 committee of independent experts , which found @entity6 investigated more than 400 allegations of misconduct while @entity15 has " not conducted any investigations into the launching of rocket and mortar attacks against @entity6			1
" " that the crimes allegedly committed by @entity15 were intentional goes without saying -- its rockets were purposefully and indiscriminately aimed at civilian targets , " @entity16 wrote friday			2
@entity16 said @entity6 should have conducted proceedings in a public forum and been more cooperative during his panel 's investigation			2
" @entity6 's lack of cooperation with our investigation meant that we were not able to corroborate how many @entity96 killed were civilians and how many were combatants , " @entity16 wrote in the @entity19 article , adding @entity6 has concluded few of its investigations			1
asked about whether the @entity6 government should have cooperated with the @entity102 commission from the start , @entity6 foreign minister @entity99 said saturday the government did not want to set a precedent for bodies it considers hostile to interfere in government decision - making			2
@entity15 , @entity16 said , continues to fire rockets and mortar rounds at civilian targets in southern @entity6 and should be condemned by the @entity24			1
the judge wrote of military commanders " making difficult battlefield decisions " and that he is confident @entity6 is appropriately investigating the deaths of 29 members of one family			0
" the shelling of the home was apparently the consequence of an @entity6 commander 's erroneous interpretation of a drone image , and an @entity6 officer is under investigation for having ordered the attack			0
" although the @entity6 evidence that has emerged since publication of our report does n't negate the tragic loss of civilian life , i regret that our fact - finding mission did not have such evidence explaining the circumstances in which we said civilians in @entity27 were targeted , because it probably would have influenced our findings about intentionality and war crimes , " @entity16 wrote			1
@entity16 said since the 2009 report , @entity141 instituted new procedures for protecting civilians , limiting the use of white phosphorus in civilian areas			0
the @entity27 - based @entity148 put the death toll in the war at 1,419 , and said that 1,167 of those were " noncombatants			1
" the @entity6 military released its own figures , claiming 1,166 people were killed and that 60 percent of those were " terror operatives			0
" in 2009 , when the @entity20 came out , @entity157 , the @entity158 's ambassador to the @entity5 , called it professional and unbiased			0
" this report should not be another report to just document and archive , " @entity157 said			0
" my people will not forgive this council if they let these criminals go unpunished			0
" but the @entity166 , which along with with the @entity167 considers @entity15 to be a terrorist organization , has contended the report was " deeply flawed			0
" in february 2010 , @entity169 , @entity166 deputy representative to the @entity5 , criticized the report and " its unbalanced focus on @entity6 , the negative inferences it draws about @entity6 's intentions and actions , its failure to deal adequately with the asymmetrical nature of the @entity27 conflict , and its failure to assign appropriate responsibility to @entity15 for deliberately targeting civilians and basing itself and its operations in heavily civilian - populated urban areas			1
" speaking saturday to @entity6 's @entity184 , @entity6 's @entity99 said , " i want to congratulate @entity16 's new conclusions , but i am not surprised by them			0
we knew the truth , and we had no doubt that it would eventually come out			0
" @entity0 's @entity190 in @entity191 contributed to this report			0

@entity20 was critical of @entity6 and @entity15 in @entity27 fighting
it focused more on allegations of @entity6 war crimes
its *author* now says he would come up with different findings
@entity6 should have been more cooperative , he writes in @entity19 op - ed piece
