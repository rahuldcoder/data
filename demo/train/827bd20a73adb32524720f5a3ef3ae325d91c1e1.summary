the @entity10 signed a cooperation deal with @entity3 on monday			1
it will give the @entity10 greater access to long - unseen nuclear sites , including a heavy - water reactor in @entity16 , the very site that may have tripped up the @entity18 talks			1
@entity19 , the director general of the @entity10 , said the agreement signified a new willingness by @entity9 to cooperate with the @entity10			1
" the atmosphere is very different , the meeting was very constructive , " he said in an interview with @entity0 's @entity23			2
" this is an important step , but this is a first step , and much more needs to be done			1

" issues that are not included in the first step will be addressed in the subsequent steps			2
" the @entity10 's talks with @entity3 are separate from the big power diplomacy , he said , referring to the recent nuclear talks between world powers and @entity3 in @entity4 , which disintegrated on sunday			1
hopes for a deal had soared after top diplomats rushed to @entity18 , but then faded amid divisions among the @entity49 countries			2
representatives from @entity3 and those six countries are scheduled to meet again in @entity18 on november 20 , in another attempt to resolve the decade long dispute			2
" @entity18 talks and @entity10 talks are independent , different and separate , " @entity19 said			1
" we are focusing on verification and technical issues			0
" @entity59 : " we made significant progress in @entity18 " the @entity10 chief has reason to be optimistic , given that this is his first agreement with @entity3 in years , said @entity64 , president of @entity65 , a public grant - making foundation focused on nuclear weapons policy and conflict resolution			1

" @entity3 has always insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes			1
western powers and @entity86 accuse it of harboring ambitions for a nuclear weapon			2
@entity3 's refusal to stop enriching uranium has led to crippling sanctions that have stunted its economy , slashed its crude oil exports and triggered widespread inflation at home			1
@entity97 senators from both parties have pushed for tougher sanctions to increase pressure on @entity3 even as the @entity18 talks showed early signs of promise last week			1
but the @entity104 warns lawmakers that tightening sanctions on @entity3 could derail the diplomatic push to curb @entity9 's nuclear program			1
secretary of state @entity109 will push diplomacy as he heads to @entity111 on wednesday to meet with members of the @entity113			0
some of the restrictions originated in that @entity113			0
the @entity59 said @entity109 would make it clear that putting new sanctions in place would be a mistake			0
" we are still determining if there is a diplomatic path forward , " @entity79 said			0
" what we are asking for right now is a pause , a temporary pause , in sanctions			0
we are not taking away sanctions			0
we are not rolling them back			0
this is about ensuring our legislative strategy and our negotiating strategy are running hand in hand			0
" " the momentum for this deal is almost irresistible , " said @entity64			2
" it may not happen november 20			0
