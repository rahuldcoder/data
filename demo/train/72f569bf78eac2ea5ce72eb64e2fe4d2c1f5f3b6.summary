@entity0 , @entity1 -- among the mounds of mud and ripped - down trees , you see an occasional appliance , a tire here and there , the twisted cables that used to be part of the telephone system			1
what you do n't see are homes			0
and it is difficult to even figure out where they once stood and what became of them			0
the sheer force of a landslide on march 22 pulverized this neighborhood in rural @entity1 , leaving behind a graveyard in the debris where 28 bodies have been recovered and where crews painstakingly search for people who are listed as missing			1
on that awful saturday , a rain - saturated hillside along the north fork of the @entity33 gave way , sending a square - mile rush of wet earth and rock into the outskirts of the town of @entity0 in @entity1 's @entity40			0
since then , rescuers have trudged through the muck -- 70 feet thick in some places -- looking for bodies , though some cling to hope someone might be found alive even 10 days later			1
the death toll in the massive landslide rose to 28 , the @entity48 's @entity47 said tuesday afternoon			0
the latest victim identified was @entity52 , a 23 - year - old who died at a hospital on the day of the slide			0
his name was not on the list of the missing			1
authorities so far have released the names of 22 deceased victims , ranging in age from 4 months to 71 years			2
twenty people remain missing , down from 22 on monday , authorities said			1
' these are our people ' : residents unite to help @entity1 landslide victims tough , nasty , dangerous conditions about 600 people , including more than 100 volunteers , and cadaver dogs are involved in the search , officials have said			1
the debris field is full of toxic sludge -- a combination of human waste , toxic chemicals from households , propane tanks , oil and gas that make the search extremely dangerous , according to lt. @entity84 of the @entity85 , who is the spokesman for efforts on the western side of the mile - wide slide			1
every person , animal and thing that comes out of the field has to be decontaminated			2
some of the workers have come down with dysentery , while supervisors are concerned that others may be at risk for tetanus			2
some of the areas in the search zone are too unstable for crews to work there			2
it would be like working in quicksand , @entity84 said			0
it smells of sewage , but more than a week after the slide , it 's not a strong odor , and the dogs , who can detect humans 10 feet under the surface , are undeterred			0
two of the nine dogs involved in monday 's search were suffering the effects of hypothermia , the coordinators of the landslide recovery teams said in a statement on the @entity123 website			1
some of the volunteers are aiding in the recovery of family mementos from the debris			2
the sounds of chainsaws fill the air , as do the rumbling motors of the excavating equipment , which grabs large objects like trees and moves them to the side			1
then other people move in for a hand search or a visual inspection of a plot			1
@entity141 ribbons mark the grid , indicating areas that have been checked , while some indicate a find of interest			0
boards are placed over the thick slop , making a wooden path for workers to walk			2
one of the biggest challenges has been standing water , but warmer temperatures and a lack of rain have helped workers , who are running pumps all day long to drain areas of the debris field			1
areas that were submerged 24 hours prior were able to be searched on tuesday			0
two @entity161 flags fly among the men and women working in the field			1
one , recovered from the debris , hangs in remembrance of lives lost			0
the other is at half - staff on the lone tree left standing in this part of the slide zone			0
who are the victims ? @entity2 's @entity175 and @entity176 contributed to this report .			0

two @entity161 flags fly above the workers in the field , one was found in a debris pile
excavators move large objects to the side , then teams go in for a hand search
large appliances and tires are part of the scene of *devastation*
twenty people still are missing , authorities said
