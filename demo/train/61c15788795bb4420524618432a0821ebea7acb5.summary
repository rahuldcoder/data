-- today , the day after the tragic shootings near @entity3 , the fog will begin to lift			0
just as after @entity5 and @entity6 , we will hear the names of the suspect and victims			0
we will learn more about the motive and imagine the nightmare that unfolded within those walls			0
in the past , hearing these horrific details would be enough to bring us together in national unity			0
but that will not be enough today			0
today , we are called to do more			0
we are called to do the hard work of listening			0
if we really want to unite in response to this national tragedy , we need to know whom we are embracing			0
for many , this means learning about @entity22 @entity21 for the first time -- and listening closely to what 's at stake			1
for me , the mass shooting is not just about how to keep guns out of the hands of a murderous few			0
it 's also about my community 's sacrifice in the struggle to live as free and proud @entity21			1
as a @entity22 @entity39 whose grandfather sailed by steamship from @entity41 , @entity42 , and settled in @entity43 100 years ago , my family 's story spans the struggle of @entity22 in @entity39			1
donning a turban and long beard , my grandfather tamed the hard floor of the @entity49 on a @entity51 tractor in the early 1900s			2
@entity22 pioneers such as my grandfather could not own land or become citizens because of the color of their skin , but they stayed and farmed , weathering race riots and decades of second - class treatment until the law permitted their children and grandchildren to become citizens			1
like many @entity22 , i grew up with deep roots in @entity39 and also fell in love with the heart of the @entity22 faith : devotion to one @entity68 , who requires us to uphold equality between women and men and all peoples , and perform seva , service to our community as an expression of our faith			1
our house of worship is called a gurdwara , where we recite and sing the poetry of our sacred @entity83 many @entity22 wear five articles of faith , including kesh , long uncut hair that most men and some women wrap in a cloth turban			2
nearly every person who wears a turban in @entity39 is @entity22			1
tragically , the turban meant to represent a commitment to service and justice has since marked @entity22 @entity21 as targets in hate violence			1
our family , alongside @entity22 families who arrived in a wave of immigration after the 1960s , became @entity39 in law but not necessarily in the eyes of our neighbors			1
i was old enough to remember racial slurs and shattered windows after the @entity105 hostage crisis , the first @entity106 and the @entity108 bombing			0
still , none of this could prepare me for 9/11			0
in the hours and days after 9/11 , turbaned @entity22 @entity21 became automatically suspect , perpetually foreign and potentially terrorist -- confused with @entity111 , and so immediate targets in @entity113 violence			1
hate violence swept the country , and on september 15 , 2001 , a @entity22 man was gunned down in front of his gas station in @entity118 , @entity119			1
my family knew @entity121 ; it felt as though an uncle had been murdered			0
but the killing was not broadcast widely on national news			0
a few days later , i grabbed my camera , left college and began a journey across @entity39 that would last a decade , capturing on film the stories of @entity21 profiled , beaten , stabbed , shot but persevering in faith and resilience			1
the @entity132 reported a 1,600 % increase in @entity113 hate crimes in the year after 9/11			1
over the last decade , i became part of a new generation of @entity22 @entity21 who organized and became lawyers , artists , journalists and elected officials , in part to advocate on behalf of a community repeatedly swept up in waves of @entity113 rhetoric , violence and racial profiling			1
in a poor economy and critical election season , we have recently watched ideologues use @entity113 bias to turn a profit in dollars and votes			0
when discontents can easily access guns , many of us feared more hate violence			2
whether or not the shooting in a @entity3 suburb is a hate crime , the news has reverberated through every @entity22 @entity39 home			1
we saw our own gurdwara on the television screen ; we imagined our own aunts and uncles , brothers and sisters , caught in the gunfire			0
and we shared an all - too - familiar sense of helplessness , grief and the sadness of a community that has long struggled to live , work and worship peacefully in this country			2
but this time , something new happened : the whole nation paid attention			0
thousands of people posted messages of love and support in the face of unspeakable tragedy			2
they knew that the @entity22 community gathered to pray on a sunday morning just like millions in churches across the country			2
they knew that the terrible loss of life so recently after the shootings in @entity6 shocks the conscience and violates our deepest values			0
they knew that this is not a @entity22 tragedy but an @entity39 tragedy			1
today and in the days to come , i believe @entity21 are hungry for the next step			2
we are ready to come together in a groundswell of healing , hope and renewed commitment to a world without violence			2
we are ready to come together in true national unity , we are ready to listen			0
there is a @entity22 gurdwara in nearly every city in @entity39			1
listen and be with us			0
@entity21 ' support -- every candle , every prayer -- will be felt by @entity22 @entity21 across the country			1
together , we can all be @entity22 ; we can all be @entity21 -- and know what that means			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			2

@entity223 's @entity22 grandfather faced *discrimination* when he came to @entity39 100 years ago
sikhs could not be citizens then , she says , and have struggled to live as free @entity21
@entity223 : turban shows commitment to @entity68 and service but marks sikhs for hate crimes
@entity223 : @entity21 are not ignoring violence against @entity22 and are rallying in support
