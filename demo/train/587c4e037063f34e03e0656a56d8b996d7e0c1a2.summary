@entity1 , @entity0 -- a @entity0 judge ruled wednesday that he does not have the authority to grant bail for @entity7 cousin @entity6 , who awaits a new trial in the 1975 slaying of neighbor @entity6			1
@entity11 judge @entity10 has said any bail should be determined by the criminal court where @entity6 's new trial would be held			1
@entity10 , who two weeks ago ruled @entity6 's conviction should be overturned , on wednesday lifted an automatic stay on that ruling , clearing the way for a new trial			1
in overturning the conviction , @entity10 said @entity6 , 53 , had been poorly represented at his murder trial			2
as part of the proceedings for a new trial , @entity6 could be allowed to leave jail on bail , but @entity10 said he wants the criminal court to decide on the conditions of any possible release			2
the state has 10 days to ask an appellate court to review @entity10 's decision to lift the stay			2
a state attorney told reporters the government is yet to decide whether it will ask for that review and declined to comment further			0
the state has said it will appeal the ruling that overturns the conviction , a process the judge said could take several years			0
but that does not preclude @entity6 from seeking bail			1
@entity6 's attorney , @entity45 , when asked about his client 's state of mind , told reporters @entity6 " understands this is a long process , " but declined further comment			1
last month , @entity10 ruled that defense attorney @entity52 's representation of @entity6 at his 2002 trial was " constitutionally deficient " and overturned the conviction			2
@entity6 's body was found in 1975 after a night of partying with @entity6 , his older brother @entity57 and other teenagers in an affluent gated community in @entity60 , @entity0			1
authorities said she was bludgeoned and stabbed to death ; a broken golf club was found near her body			0
the case languished for more than two decades			0
a series of books on the high - profile crime renewed interest , leading to new tips and a new suspect in january 2000 : @entity6 , who was 15 at the time of the killing			0
@entity6 , the nephew of @entity74 and @entity7 , has always proclaimed his innocence			0
