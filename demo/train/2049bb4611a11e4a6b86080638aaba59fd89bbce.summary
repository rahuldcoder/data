-- in television dramas like @entity4 ' " @entity3 , " serial killers are apprehended swiftly and surely			1
in real murder cases -- as in the investigation and recent capture of a suspect in the so - called " @entity9 " killings on the south side of @entity12 , @entity13 -- it can take years , even decades , to bring a suspect to justice			1
police are now saying that the arrest of 57 - year - old @entity9 closes the book on at least 11 unsolved murders that occurred since 1985			2
unlike most homicides , which are solved in a matter of days , if not hours , crimes committed by a prolific serial offender present a daunting challenge to investigators			1
there is an element of self - selection : only those perpetrators who possess the right level of skill , street savvy or cunning can remain at large long enough to amass a large victim count and , therefore , achieve the status of serial killer			2
a careless wannabe would likely be stopped long before that point , and certainly before reaching double digits as did the @entity9			0
however , the difficulties that homicide detectives confront when searching for unidentified serial murderers are not so much about their being " master criminals " -- as most are not -- but about their usual offense pattern and modus operandi			1
several factors common among serial murderers and their crimes work in their favor and tend to keep their identity a mystery : 1			2
serial murderers usually target strangers -- those who happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time and who are selected either out of sheer convenience or because they fit the killers ' fantasies and murder script			1
thus , the standard investigative approach used by homicide detectives of assembling a list of likely suspects ( friends , neighbors , and co-workers , anyone with a reason to kill the victim ) does n't help in the least			0
the killer could be just about anyone with whom the victims came in contact			2
and when the victims live off the streets , like some of the women slain by the @entity9 , the list of possible suspects can be endless			2
serial killers generally dispose of their victims ' bodies in remote or otherwise hidden places -- a river , a wooded area , or even in large garbage bags tossed in trash bins			1
as a result , the police do n't have an evidence - rich crime scene ( where the victims were assaulted ) to scour for clues			1
the disposal site tends to yield very little in the way of physical evidence , especially if it is exposed to the elements or wildlife			0
serial killers tend to be ordinary in appearance , looking above suspicion			1
like the man arrested in connection with the @entity9 murders , they just do n't fit our stereotype of a vicious killer			0
people are usually incredulous when they learn the allegation of their neighbor 's hidden activities			0
in fact , the seemingly trustworthy veneer that aids serial killers in attracting victims into their grasp also serves them well in appearing anything but suspicious			1
in addition , their detailed planning process often includes conjuring up a host of plausible alibis should the police come knocking at the door			0
serial killers , like the @entity9 , tend to prefer vulnerable people as targets , especially prostitutes , drug users or other marginal types whose disappearance will not generally bring a massive police effort or strong community response			1
also , those on the street who might be in a position to witness the abduction of a prostitute or drug user do not generally make for cooperative and reliable witnesses			0
for all of these reasons , serial killers , when eventually discovered , are often captured because of luck -- bad luck on their part and terrific luck for the rest of us			1
in the @entity9 case , police used a discarded slice of pizza to get @entity9 's dna , which they linked to evidence at some of the crime scenes , sources told the @entity154			2
and sometimes , serial killers just get a bit too overconfident after years and years of eluding law enforcement and begin to see themselves as unstoppable			1
at that point , they frequently become careless and take unnecessary risks			0
ultimately , their own arrogance becomes their downfall			0
despite the challenges that serial murder cases pose for homicide investigators , there are certain strategies that can maximize the chances of solving a case , even when the trail grows cold with passing years			1
although dna evidence did not produce any direct hits to a suspect , the @entity12 police went the extra mile by checking indirect familial dna matches			0
after linking genetic material to a prisoner , circumstantial evidence led investigators to the inmate 's father -- @entity9 -- the @entity154 reported			0
but often the secret to success is nothing as intricate or intriguing as the various scientific tools featured on @entity185			0
rather , it entails old - fashioned approaches such as canvassing the neighborhood , interviewing witnesses and preparing detailed investigative reports			0
most of all , successful serial murder investigations require skilled management of personnel and information			0
when the body count rises , so does the volume of leads that need to be pursued and number of officers involved in the manhunt			0
the key to solving a seemingly unsolvable crime often comes down to administrative efficiency , as well as to that little stroke of welcome luck			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			2

serial killers often elude capture for years *due* to *nature* of their crimes , says @entity208
he says they are hard to identify because they lack *obvious* ties to the victims
@entity208 says in many cases there is no crime scene available for *analysis*
administrative efficiency by police -- and luck -- play a key part , he says
