-- and here we were expecting a slice of key lime pie			0
@entity4 has surprised the tech world by announcing that the next version of @entity7 , its mobile operating system , will be named @entity8 -- in honor of the candy bar developers munched on while they were creating it			1
" we could n't imagine a better name for our @entity7 k release than the tasty chocolate that 's been a favorite among the team since the early days of @entity7 , " said @entity12 , @entity4 's marketing director for @entity7			1
the name keeps with a @entity4 tradition , established in 2009 , of naming versions of the industry - leading system after sweet treats			1
but it 's the first time one of the nicknames has been a trademarked product and , as such , @entity8 maker @entity27 was needed to sign on			2
the @entity30 food and drink maker did -- and in a big way			0
more than 50 million @entity8 bars , specially branded with @entity4 's green @entity7 robot on their packaging , will be released , giving customers a chance to win prizes that include a @entity39 tablet and credits to the @entity42 store			1
a small number of robot - shaped @entity8 will also be shipped as surprises for customers			0
the company also got in on the act with its @entity8 website , which has been overhauled to look like the site of a tech company rolling out a sleek new piece of electronics			0
that includes an earnest promotional video that could easily be read as a swipe at @entity57 , @entity4 's chief mobile rival			1
" every corner , every edge , every finger of every bar has been carefully considered and crafted to create a beautifully immersive and multisensory experience , " @entity58 , @entity8 's " chief breaks officer " says earnestly over a swelling orchestral arrangement not unlike the ones @entity57 uses to build excitement for new products			0
if there 's any remaining doubt , the slogan " there 's a @entity8 for that " appears briefly on a tablet screen in the video			0
@entity74 , director of @entity7 global partnerships , told the @entity76 that the @entity27 deal is " not a money - changing - hands kind of deal , " but was dreamed up by developers who kept @entity8 , along with other snacks , in their break room while coding			1
he said the @entity7 team did n't even know which company owned @entity8 and that he cold - called the switchboard of @entity27 's advertising agency in november to float the idea			1
the next day he was on a conference call , and the deal was sealed 24 hours later			2
to maintain the element of surprise -- an increasingly tough ask for big tech companies whose every move is scrutinized -- the @entity7 team continued , even internally , calling the upcoming system " @entity95 , " which had been the presumed name for months			2
@entity7 has been developed by the company 's engineers under dessert names ever since the release of @entity100 in 2009			0
the other iterations have been named donut , @entity7 , @entity7 , @entity103 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105			1
@entity4 is not the only tech company to name its products along a consistent theme			2
but @entity57 appears to have recently abandoned a similar practice with its @entity111 operating system -- @entity112 in a departure , @entity57 's next @entity111 operating system will not be named after a cat			1
instead , the 10th iteration of @entity112 will be called @entity117 , named for a popular surfing spot in @entity119			0
previous version names have included @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125			0
a joint statement from @entity4 and @entity27 did not give a release date for @entity128 , although some observers expect it to be launched this fall .			0

new version of @entity7 mobile operating system will be named @entity8
surprise *announcement* is consistent with @entity4 's theme of sweet treats
older @entity7 versions include @entity7 , @entity7 , @entity103 , @entity105
deal with @entity27 *reportedly* was struck in 24 hours
