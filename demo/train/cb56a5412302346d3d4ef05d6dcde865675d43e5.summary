it 's her @entity10 acceptance speech , the one she wrote as a 12 - year - old			1
she vowed not to open it until she could read it from the stage accepting her award			0
sixteen years later , the time may be nearer when @entity5 can open the envelope			1
the road has been a long one , starting with her standing on a milk crate as a child so she could sing solos in the church choir			0
but these days , she is an up - and - comer in country music -- and a rare @entity26 - @entity26 performer in the genre			1
@entity5 acknowledged this week to students in @entity0 that some people had told her she could n't sing country because she was african - american			1
but she said , " when you tell me i ca n't do something , it just makes me want to do it more			0
" @entity5 told @entity2 that no one in the music industry had discouraged her based on race but that people who loved her were concerned country stardom might be a tough goal			1

" " @entity72 , " the first single off @entity5 's self - titled 2007 debut album , made her the first @entity26 - @entity26 female in 20 years to hit @entity70 's country chart , according to @entity71			1
country music is home to a smattering of well - known @entity26 artists			1
@entity79 is by far the most visible , but other artists have dabbled in country as well -- the @entity82 , for instance , and @entity84			2
more recently , @entity85 , longtime lead singer for @entity86 , hit the top of the country charts as well			1
african - americans always have been in the country music industry , said @entity91 , senior historian for the @entity92 in @entity93 , @entity94			1
however , it 's rare for an artist -- of any race -- to reach the level of stardom attained by @entity100 , who had 67 records on the country chart between 1966 and 1990 , more than 20 of them in the @entity104			1
" some people at the time , and since , called him the @entity107 of country music , but nobody who followed him has yet reached that level , " @entity91 said			1

still , she said she doubted she could break into the genre			0
" when you 're a child , you react to something that 's familiar and looks like you , " she told @entity71 in 2007			0

just being a kid , you do n't see black country singers			2
so you do n't think that 's a possibility for you			0
you see black pop singers			2
you see black @entity135 singers			2
so you say , ' if i 'm black and i want to sing , then i probably have to sing @entity135			2
' " @entity91 echoed @entity5 's comments about the music industry being tough on new artists			1
more than ever , " it takes a lot of money to put an artist out there on promotional tours , " creating videos and the like , he said			0
@entity91 said many @entity26 - @entity26 artists probably gravitate to other genres			0
and , for artists of any race , " once you 're in the door ... it 's still a matter of catching on			0
" " there are a certain number of people who are just not used to seeing a black person on @entity71 or @entity160 [ @entity160 ] , " he said			2
" it just does n't compute , for whatever reason			0
" @entity5 's family moved to @entity164 , @entity165 , when she was 13 , according to her web site			2

" at the audition we were instructed to pick an artist that we admired and perform some of their songs			0
i chose @entity182 and @entity183			0

" anything you want to do , you can do it			0
" however , she cautioned them that being a singer is not always fun , even though she loves it			0
" the best advice i can give you is that this is a job that i do , " she said			0
" ... you have to take it very seriously			0
" she fielded questions with a sense of humor , telling them some of her favorite songs ( one is @entity227 's " @entity226 " ) and her favorite instrument -- a guitar ( " have you ever tried to push a piano around with you ? " she asked )			2
