@entity0 , @entity1 -- gas and oil prices rose in @entity1 monday after the country dramatically cut subsidies for its citizens to bolster the nation 's sagging economy			1
the initiative went into effect sunday , with the country saying it will gradually remove all subsidies within five years			1
the price of subsidized gasoline rose four - folds -- from 1,000 rials ( 9 cents ) per liter to 4,000 rials , the @entity16 news agency said			1
officials say energy subsidies have cost the @entity1 government around $ 100 billion dollars a year , state run @entity24 said monday			2
while some have said the plan will stoke inflation , others say it is in line with recommendations from international financial organizations to solve @entity1 's economic woes , @entity24 said			0
five years ago , @entity34 's government announced its plan to cut government subsidies and help adjust prices in @entity1 's economy			2
that includes a policy to phase out subsidies on staples such as fuel and food , likely causing consumers ' costs of such items to rise			0
@entity1 has $ 10 trillion in oil resources alone , plus natural gas reserves worth between $ 3.5 and $ 4.5 trillion , @entity49 mission chief @entity48 said in an interview posted earlier this fall on that world body 's website			1
but its economy nonetheless has seen lackluster growth , including between 1 % and 2 % of gdp this past year			0
despite its abundance of fuel , @entity1 has been pushing to expand its nuclear program			0
many in the international community , including @entity65 officials , have expressed grave concerns and successfully pushed for sanctions fearing that @entity0 might be trying to develop nuclear weapons			0
but @entity1 leaders have said the nation wants nuclear power , in part to free up more oil to export and pump more money into the economy			0
with subsidies that effectively allowed domestic consumers to pay relatively little for oil and gas -- far below what they or people anywhere else would pay on the world market -- @entity1 was forfeiting potentially huge revenues , explained @entity49 senior economist @entity85 on his group 's website			1
the @entity89 news agency reported saturday that @entity1 ' use of commodities like fuel " has not followed a reasonable pattern " -- with @entity85 saying that many @entity1 citizens have been buying excess amounts of oil and gas			2
@entity1 's subsidy reforms , he said , aim to decrease domestic demand for fuel , make the country more fuel - efficient , and allow @entity1 to profit more from its natural resources .			1

the country plans to remove all subsidies in five years
the price of gasoline goes up four - folds
@entity1 has trillions of dollars in natural resources but still struggles , *experts* say
the changes aim to *dampen* domestic demand for fuel and oil , and bolster overall revenues
