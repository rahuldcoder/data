-- what 's the most important position in football ? who 's the guy who we need to watch most closely to determine which way the @entity7 will swing ? i 've been asking that question of every sports fan who knows more about football than i do today , from 10 - year - old dreamers to veterans of the field and couch			1
i keep getting the same answers : quarterback			0
nobody got the right answer			0
( the opinion just expressed is solely the opinion of the writer and some very huge men who play center or were protected by centers )			1
just try , this one @entity7 , to think of the game through the eyes of the center and see what happens			1
the walk on this journey begins with a chance encounter i had the other week with a guy who owns a sports marketing firm , a guy named @entity42			0
i looked up at this giant of a man ( for context -- i 'm 5 - foot - 8 -- in cleats )			0
i asked him , " what 's your sport ? " " football , " he answered			1
he played center for the @entity52 a long time ago			1
@entity53 : the president who saved football not a star player , he emphasized			1
but a guy so determined to play center for the college of his choice that he paid full tuition and tried out for the team as a walk - on			1
one of the 100 - plus players on the @entity69 's roster			0
and each season , he worked to become a center worthy of the @entity69 name			1
so i asked : what does a center do besides snap the ball and block the guy in front of him ? that 's when he led me on a journey that convinced me that the most exciting 30 seconds of the game is the 30 seconds between when the huddle breaks ups and the ball is snapped			1
the snap " everyone talks about hitting the quarterback , " says @entity42			1
quarterbacks get hit during the game			1
seven , eight , nine times			0
and @entity42 does n't dismiss the punishment that inflicts			0
five tech tools for the @entity7 but a center , says @entity42 , a center gets hit every single play			1
if the offense is controlling the ball , that could mean 70 or more times a game that the center takes a hit			1
but are they smart ? center brain the center brain has to process vast amounts of information instantly			1
every play is very detailed			1
more specific than i ever imagined			0
often , right down to how many steps back the quarterback will take before he plants his foot and throws the ball			0
you know the expression in war -- that a battle plan changes the moment the first shot is fired			0
in football it often changes , repeatedly , before the first shot , before the ball is even snapped			1
the center -- and his offensive line -- know the qb 's planning to pass			1
the center knows all the details of the play			1
the @entity7 's humble beginnings he bends down , puts his hands on the leather and that 's when he begins to read the defense			0
the defense , says @entity42 , is often trying to mess with your head -- confuse the offensive line and the qb			0
it 's the center 's job to read the defense and help rewrite the offense			1
the defense is mixing things up , trying to create confusion for the offensive linemen			0
the qb 's got a big brain			0
so , says @entity160 , if the qb knows the defense he sees at the line of scrimmage is not the defense he thought he 'd see , he realizes his team ca n't throw the ball now			0
so the center is audibling -- shouting out a new protection plan to his offensive linemen			1
i knew the qb shouted audibles -- changed plays on the fly			0
i did n't know the center had to do that , too			2
" black , black , " shouts the center , which tells the offensive line they 're about to change the play			1
but you ca n't shout black all day because at some point the defense -- even if they 're not as bright as the center , which i would never say , because , as i mentioned , i 'm 5 - foot - 8 -- early on realizes black or blue or @entity183 means the offensive line is on to the defense 's tricks , so the offense needs to keep changing the colors that signal an audible so the defense is forced to keep guessing too			2
the qb shouts black 26 -- which , for our purposes now , might mean we 're not passing any more			0
the center knows the count for the snap , a little extra detail he has to keep in his brain during all this processing			1
it 's a noisy place to process information			1
a stadium full of fans are screaming			0
it 's hard to hear			0
but the brawn has to use his brain			0
and all this is happening , @entity42 points out , " just after you got your brains beat in and the snot knocked out of you " on the previous play			2
too much information " on top of it , the qb is getting information called in through a coach who 's on the sidelines who 's listening to other coaches with a bird 's eye view of the field			2
but " you ca n't get frustrated			0
" that 's how it is for anyone who works in any company , including a football team			2
" you can have eight coaches on the sideline , some high in the booth , others on the ground , they can all see things -- things that you may not see			0
but at the end of the day , " says @entity42 , " it 's the player who has to see things			2
" breathless all this is happening , @entity42 notes , while the center and everyone else on the field is out of breath			2
because they 've been working out on the field -- real time			2
at the @entity7 in particular , he says , you need to make sure that during the pregame hype ( which is going on at this very moment ) all the way through the coin flip and the national anthem -- that you , the player , the center , can calm yourself down			1
have we mentioned the snap yet ? no. the ball has n't even been snapped yet			2
and you know what else the center has to have on his mind			2
as soon as the center jumps out of the huddle and gets to the line , he puts his hand on the ball			1
with the shotgun hike -- which we 'll see a lot of today -- the center has to get it to the qb 's waist level quickly			2
" almost sounds like reading dr. @entity274 when you 're about to collide with 300 pounds			0
the play is on a lot more goes on in those 30 seconds between the break of the huddle and the snap of the ball			1
but there 's just one more thing that the former @entity69 center -- who says he had the privilege of playing in about five @entity69 games for a total of about 50 snaps -- wants to let us all know to look for when we watch the @entity7 and remember when we return to work monday morning			2
football , says @entity42 , gave him " a real controlled environment in which to learn that life 's not always going to be fair			2
a controlled environment of stress and discipline			0
things are n't going to always work out the way you think			0
" and so this big man , this @entity69 walk - on , who is now a father of four with his own business , wants us to know this about what happens when the play is over and the whistle blows			2
" you finish the play , and see whether it succeeded or failed -- whether everyone did their job or did n't			2
guess what , " he asks as my young daughter asks when she 's excited to teach me something she knows			0
" you know how you get rewarded after all that , after the whistle blows and the play is over ? you go back in the huddle			1
and you have to do it all over again			0
" the universe of the center			0
it 's the universe we share			0
