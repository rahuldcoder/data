@entity0 -- in a sharp turnaround , @entity4 @entity3 leaders monday dropped a key demand that the cost of extending the payroll tax cut be offset by spending cuts elsewhere in the budget			1
the decision removes a major obstacle to passage of the tax cut extension for the rest of the year -- a move that has been in question			2
@entity18 called the @entity3 decision welcome news -- a " major breakthrough , " according to a @entity18 aide familiar with the negotiations -- because the tax cut , which would otherwise expire february 29 , is a key part of president @entity26 's economic recovery strategy			1
for @entity3 , the move trims a thorny political issue			2
after nearly blocking an extension of the payroll tax cut late last year over concerns about how to pay for it , @entity3 acknowledged they had angered voters			1
the top three @entity3 leaders in the @entity4 released a statement saying they were prepared to remove the contentious payroll issue from a bill that would also extend unemployment benefits and prevent a fee cut to @entity41 doctors -- known as the " doc fix " -- in order to " protect small businesses and our economy from the consequences of @entity0 @entity18 ' political games			1
" " unfortunately , to date , @entity18 have refused virtually every spending cut proposed -- insisting on job - threatening tax hikes on small businesses and job creators -- and with respect to the need for an extension of the payroll tax cut , time is running short , " said the statement from @entity4 speaker @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity4 majority leader @entity51 , @entity52 , and @entity4 majority whip @entity53 , @entity54			1
in the past , @entity4 @entity3 leaders have often struggled to get rank - and - file conservative members to go along with their decisions on spending issues -- particularly when related to negotiations with @entity18			1
the fact that all three leaders issued the statement was seen by aides in both parties as a sign that they expect to be able to pass the bill without conservatives who might break with the leadership			0
@entity4 @entity3 will meet in closed session tuesday to discuss the proposal , which could be voted on in the @entity4 by the end of the week , the leaders said			2
aides in both parties said they expect negotiations to continue on the so - called " doc - fix " and unemployment benefit extension			0
but they said removing the payroll issue from those talks should make it easier to reach agreement on them			0
those talks would also include potential cost offsets for the payroll tax cut extension , even if it has already passed , the @entity3 leaders said in their statement			1
sen. @entity99 of @entity100 , who heads the @entity102 @entity3 election effort , said the decision removes a political hurdle for republicans as they head into what 's expected to be a hard - fought election			2
" i think we all recognize that the president 's playbook is one to run against @entity111 and claim we 're the problem , " he told @entity1			0
@entity4 press secretary @entity113 insisted monday there was time for @entity111 to work out a comprehensive agreement that would extend both the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance			1
however , @entity113 stopped short of saying @entity26 would oppose the @entity4 proposal to separate the payroll tax provision from the other issues under negotiation			2
" this is a hypothetical proposal put out that they said they might do if conversations with folks on @entity128 do n't progress according to the way they want , " @entity113 told reporters			0
" let 's just see how this process plays out			0
extending unemployment insurance as well as the so - called ' doc fix ' is equally important -- certainly very important , and very important for our economy			0
so the president supports extending all of it , and doing it in a way that is easily achievable if folks put ideological and partisan positions aside			0
" @entity1 's @entity143 contributed to this report .			0

new : the @entity4 says there is time to work out a comprehensive deal
@entity4 @entity3 say they will not demand spending cuts to offset the payroll tax cut
@entity3 concede they had angered voters by pushing that issue late last year
the move , @entity4 @entity3 leaders say , will blunt " @entity18 ' political games "
