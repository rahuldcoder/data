@entity0 , @entity1 -- people who knew and studied maj. @entity4 say he was a loner who had no luck finding a wife , and a criminal profiler said the @entity0 shooting suspect fits the profile of a mass murderer better than that of a terrorist			1
investigators are searching for any missed " red flags " that might have prevented last week 's fatal shooting , which left 12 soldiers and one civilian dead and 40 other people wounded			1
however , the @entity18 has said its investigations indicate the " alleged gunman acted alone and was not part of a broader terrorist plot			2
" " a lot of people are jumping to the conclusion because this man spouted violent @entity29 ideology that this is a terrorist attack , " criminologist @entity23 said			0
@entity23 , who profiles killers , said @entity4 's profile is that of a loner			1
" he was simply a lone guy who had issues , problems , psychopathic behaviors that escalated to the point where he wanted to get back at society , and he took it out on his workmates like most of them do , " he said			0
a cleric at the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44 , where @entity4 attended when he lived in the area , said @entity4 seemed to become " somewhat withdrawn " after the death of his mother in 2001			1
" some individuals said that their experience with him , that he changed after his mother passed away , " @entity48 said			0
another cleric there , @entity51 , said efforts to find a wife for @entity4 were unsuccessful			1
" well , we were not successful in matching him with somebody , " he said			0
@entity4 , a 39 - year - old psychiatrist , came under investigation last year when his communications with radical cleric @entity60 were intercepted by terrorism investigators who were monitoring @entity60 , a federal law enforcement official told @entity2			1
but an employee of the @entity65 's @entity64 , assigned to the @entity66 , decided to drop the investigation after reviewing the intercepted communications and @entity4 's personnel files			2
a senior @entity65 official said the task force 's ground rules prevented that information from being transmitted outside the task force , although others disputed that			0
" i find it hard to believe that they would just say , ' ok , we 're not going to share any of this information with the military , ' " @entity78 law enforcement analyst @entity77 said			0
" i mean , that 's why you have a person from the military , from different military branches , on the task force to be the liaison			0
" a former counterterrorism official said the information about @entity4 's communications with the imam should have been shared with the military unless the @entity18 specifically forbade it			2
still , one source familiar with the investigation said @entity4 's communications with @entity60 appeared innocent in nature			2
another federal source familiar with the investigation said @entity4 's actions give no indication he was following the guidance in @entity104 's terrorist handbook in the weeks before thursday 's attack			1
that handbook directs jihadists to conceal their religion , mask their beliefs and blend in			0
instead , @entity4 frequently appeared in public in traditional @entity113 clothing and prayed daily at the local mosque , making no attempt to hide his religion or conservative beliefs , the source said			2
@entity4 remained hospitalized wednesday in stable condition and has not been formally charged with any of the 13 deaths in last week 's shooting			1
his civilian attorney , retired @entity122 col. @entity121 , said he has spoken with his client , but that he was heavily sedated			0
" i think the closest thing that indicates that there 's a court - martial in the works is last night about 8 i did receive an e-mail from the prosecutor at @entity0 indicating to me that the pass privileges and leave privileges of maj. @entity4 had been revoked , " @entity121 said			1
@entity2 's @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 contributed to this report .			0
