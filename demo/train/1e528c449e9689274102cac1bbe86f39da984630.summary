-- when the body is totally inert , the brain can still be busy			2
even in a coma , brain imaging technology has shown , some people 's brains show blood flow patterns that indicate something is going on inside their heads , although it 's not necessarily indicative of awareness			1
doctors say they have observed " significant brain activity " in former @entity14 prime minister @entity13			2
they are basing this statement on the results of experiments done with functional magnetic resonance imaging , or @entity19 , showing that @entity13 's brain behaves differently when he is presented with familiar sounds and pictures than with unfamiliar stimuli			1
" it suggests the brain has the capability to react , " said dr. @entity25 , neuroscientist at the @entity26 , who is not involved in @entity13 's care			1
" what that means in terms of long - term outcomes is indeterminate			0
" @entity19 lets scientists see changes in blood flow in the brain , which is associated with neuronal activity			1
it does not measure the actual activity , but can provide clues that some areas are still functional			0
how such results should be interpreted , and if there 's any connection to a potential recovery , is not known			1
doctors compared @entity13 's brain responses when he viewed photos of random houses to when he was shown a photo of his own house			1
they observed a different response in the brain in conjunction with the familiar place than for the other images			2
@entity13 , 84 , also showed distinct brain activity patterns when his family members spoke to him , compared to when their voices were distorted so they were no longer familiar and sounded like gibberish			0
the brain response for a family member 's voice was in " the correct location " for when a cognitively normal person hears familiar people speaking , said dr. @entity71 , head of @entity72 at @entity73 , who was involved in the @entity19 tests but is not @entity13 's attending physician			1
such results suggest there may be some higher processing of information going on , and that areas of the brain important for processing complex stimuli are still functioning , said dr. @entity82 , chairman and professor in the department of neurosurgery at @entity86 , who is not involved in @entity13 's care			1
it is not proof that @entity13 is conscious of the familiar sounds and images , and recognizing them as a fully healthy person would , he said			0
because doctors had not given these tests to @entity13 previously , it 's unclear whether this represents an improvement			1
@entity0 has reported since 2006 that @entity13 has been in a coma since suffering a massive stroke that year			0
the longer a person is in a coma , the less likely he or she is to recover , @entity25 said			0
@entity71 said that @entity13 is not in a coma or vegetative state , and is somewhere between a coma and consciousness			0
he sleeps , wakes up , eats and swallows on his own , and his eyes open and close , @entity71 said			0
@entity71 declined to comment on @entity13 's general health			0
there is a continuum between brain death and normal awareness that patients such as @entity13 fall into , @entity82 said			1
the @entity19 results suggest he is not brain dead , because areas above the brain stem are showing activity			1
there are also patients who are " locked - in , " and are totally aware of the sights and sounds around them , but can not move or speak			0
brain - controlled devices may help paralyzed people for clinical purposes , it appears that @entity13 is in a coma , @entity82 said			2
" we have seen patients make remarkable improvements after being in a coma for a long time , but the best prognostic indicator is how one does over time , " @entity82 said			0
" most improvement will occur within the first one to two years			2
" as @entity13 has been in a coma for seven years , the @entity19 evidence is positive , but it would be unusual for him to start talking , for example , given how long he has stayed in this state , @entity82 said			1
the scientists have likely gotten these new results because , even when a person is in a coma , " parts of the nervous system that are still functioning are capable of learning and capable of changing their activity patterns , " said dr. @entity147 , professor of neurology , neurosurgery and anesthesia at the @entity150 , who is not involved with @entity13 's care			1
it 's a phenomenon that has been studied and described before , he said			0
" even with severe brain injury , some qualities of the human existence are preserved and we should always treat patients with dignity , " @entity147 said			0
but it 's unclear what such brain activity patterns would mean for a patient 's future			1
" we do n't understand how these small changes in function are linked to recovery , " he said			0
if the same @entity19 tests are repeated six months and nine months from now to compare activity levels , that would provide some indication of whether @entity13 is headed in a positive direction , @entity82 said			2
" what you really want to know : is he improving , and can you extrapolate that improvement out over some period of time to predict how well he 's going to ultimately improve to ? " he said			2
@entity177 moves home for weekend @entity0 's @entity179 and @entity180 contributed to this report .			0

it 's not known how @entity19 results relate to patient 's recovery from a coma
there is a continuum between brain death and normal awareness
most improvement in a patient in a coma occurs within one to two years
