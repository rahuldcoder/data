-- at an immigration reform event in @entity3 , @entity4 , about a year - and - a - half ago , a man approached attorney @entity5 pleading for help			0
the man was a @entity8 immigrant who had been living in the @entity9 illegally for several years			1
he abandoned @entity8 to flee what he called persecution			1
he said he was socially ostracized , targeted by police			0
the abuse was too much to bear			0
so now he was in @entity4 , and had already been ripped off once as he tried to seek asylum in the @entity9			1
" he just stole my heart , " @entity5 said of the immigrant			0
it only took that initial short conversation to realize that " the situation in @entity8 is very severe			1
i realized that there was persecution			0
" @entity5 took his case			0
then the next week , there were more phone calls to her office from deaf immigrants who had entered the country illegally looking for asylum			1
as of this week , @entity5 has had 30 deaf immigrants complete asylum interviews with the pertinent authorities , and has another 30 such clients awaiting their turn			1
they come from several countries , though the majority are from @entity8			1
according to @entity5 , these are the first petitions for asylum by deaf people on the grounds that they are persecuted for their disability			1
no rulings have been made in any of the novel cases , but critics say that they represent a perversion of the original intent of asylum law			2
while these types of cases are new , immigrants have long tested the boundaries of what merits persecution for the purposes of remaining legally in the @entity9			1
the first asylum application for @entity58 's deaf clients was filed in june of last year , and it 's possible that no decisions will be handed down until all 60 cases have had at least an initial interview			1
such cases seek to expand the criteria for who qualifies for asylum , said @entity67 , spokesman for the @entity68 , an anti-illegal - immigration group			2
the law " is being used and abused as a way to game the system , " he said			1
some asylum cases such as these are used to postpone a deportation , he added			1
no matter how frivolous , he said , it buys time			0
but @entity5 says the cases are anything but frivolous			0
" i think it 's clear , " she said			0
" the law provides for certain groups to ask for protection in the @entity9 @entity85 is one of those groups , " there are five traditional categories covered by @entity9 asylum law : race , religion , nationality , political opinion or membership in a specific social group			1
the first hurdle that the majority of her clients face , even before they make their case before an immigration judge for asylum , is an administrative one			1
all but one of the deaf immigrants has to prove that they qualify to apply , even though a deadline to apply for asylum has passed			1
the law requires that asylum - seekers file within one year of arriving in the @entity9			1
only one of the 60 immigrants in this case meets that requirement , the attorney said			2
but there exist exceptional circumstances , and @entity5 says her clients qualify			0
there is a lack of advocacy in @entity8 , and a lack of communication that resulted in the deaf immigrants not knowing that asylum was an option when they arrived in the @entity9			1
furthermore , she argues , once in the @entity9 , they were preyed upon by scammers and developed a fear of immigration help , she said			1
the bottom line , she said , is that these people " escaped their home countries because of persecution			2
" she listed the conditions they faced back home , such as being denied the right to be properly educated , having no formal language until a later age , and abuse by family and police , she said			2
@entity8 's foreign affairs ministry did not immediately comment on the deaf immigrants ' claims when reached by @entity0			1
the @entity9 simply can not receive every person who is disadvantaged in their home country , @entity67 said			1
" i think the more we push the reasonable boundaries of the definition of asylum , the further we are getting away from its original intent , " he said			2
but @entity155 , an asylum law expert at @entity156 , said that the boundaries of asylum law have always been a busy place for novel claims			2
" i do n't think there 's a bigger trend			2
people will always try to be creative , " he said			2
in december 2009 , after a 14 - year legal battle , @entity165 @entity164 was granted asylum on the grounds that she faced domestic abuse in her homeland			2
her attorneys successfully argued that women who face domestic violence may be viewed as a particular social group , a requirement that must be met before asylum can be granted			0
last year , a family from @entity179 who were @entity181 homeschoolers were granted asylum because of what they described as persecution from @entity179 authorities against that type of schooling			0
they argued that @entity179 did n't allow homeschooling for reasons of conscience			0
that said , @entity192 - @entity155 added , the deaf immigrants face an uphill battle			0
" they can apply for asylum , but i think they are going to have a hard time winning , " he said			0
discrimination is not the same thing as persecution , he said			0
the onus will be on the immigrants to show that they are being persecuted by the government or by people that the government can not control			0
in the meantime , @entity5 's reputation as a defender of the deaf immigrant community continues to grow			0
she has invested in sign language translators who can help with a diverse group of immigrants -- many who use unique signs from their individual countries			0
a few have even moved to @entity4 to be represented by her , she said .			0

60 deaf people , mostly from @entity8 , are seeking asylum in the @entity9
they say their home governments persecute them , do n't educate them
a major hurdle is that only one of the 60 has filed for asylum within deadline
critic says some are " trying to game the system " to avoid deportation
