-- a recent study with a catchy headline about the most stressful jobs of 2013 found its way to the soft hour of news this week			1
the annual study by @entity7 created some buzz in the online water cooler and i was asked to appear on the " today " show to talk about it			2
colleagues e-mailed me and posted on my @entity14 page about where their chosen professions ranked			0
my media friends could n't help noticing that public relations professionals , reporters and photojournalists all made it into the top 10 for stress			2
the " study , " referred to in quotes in some of the commentary , considered some logical criteria to come up with these rankings			0
proximity to risk of death ( yours or others ' ) , travel , deadlines , working in the public eye and physical demands all racked up points on the stress scale			2
and there 's no arguing that military personnel , firefighters and police officers -- all high - rankers on the most - stressed list -- are exposed to higher stakes than your typical seamstress ( holder of the second - least stressful job slot )			1
the job that snagged the " least stressful " slot , according to the survey , was " university professor , " a designation that caused outrage among people who actually hold that job			1
one commenter conceded that most academic jobs do n't put you in personal danger ( though you can argue that point ) , but anyone who 's ever been around professors knows that faculty politics , difficult students and pressure to " publish or perish " can cause even the most calm character to crack			2
we could debate whether these designations make any sense			0
and whether every police officer , firefighter and member of the military faces the same amount of stress			2
but let 's make sure we are having the right conversation			0
how many people choose a profession based on how high the stress level is ? and how can you measure stress objectively ? if you 're prone to stress , perhaps you 're just as likely to feel stressed out whether you work as a librarian , a massage therapist or a commercial airline pilot ( no. 4 on the stress list )			1
people choose their line of work for a lot of reasons			2
for those who are committed to making our communities and the world safer and healthier for the rest of us , minimizing stress is probably not so high on their list of criteria			1
and it should n't be			0
folks who choose helping jobs that may have a high level of stress are fueled by other motivators , like wanting their work to have meaning			1
they are n't deterred by the fact that their job will likely come with stress			1
and some people are simply by their own nature and personalities drawn to work that may be to others , dauntingly stressful			1
how many @entity115 agents do you think would prefer a gig as an audiologist ( sixth - least stressful job ) ? when i talk to men and women in their 50s and 60s who 've decided to take on encore careers as teachers , they tell me that the work is often exhausting and stressful			1
they are on their feet all day , often with inadequate resources , with kids who are themselves highly stressed ; even those who come from leadership roles in other sectors say they 've never worked harder			0
yet they almost always tell me that doing something that matters to others -- and that puts them in touch with young people every day -- compensates for the added stress			1
the same is true of those tackling some of the world 's most intractable problems			0
when i talk to @entity141 and @entity142 , whose foundation trains health - care professionals around the world to work with victims of trauma , or @entity147 , who founded @entity148 , which works with returning veterans , they rarely talk about stress			2
instead they talk about how they are compelled to do what they do , because moving the needle even a fraction is better than doing nothing			0
rather than discouraging people to take on jobs that might have a lot of stress , let 's instead encourage those who are designed for those jobs to do them			1
and let 's make sure to support our friends and family members who go down these paths			0
it 's hard to grab headlines in the crowded space of morning television , but a good survey with a catchy title will always do that			0
so let 's use these kinds of surveys to have the right kinds of conversations			0
like why so many jobs that keep us safe and healthy , and that care for our children and the environment rarely show up on lists of the most highly compensated jobs			0
now there 's a conversation i 'd most like to be having			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			1

@entity192 : annual list of most stressful jobs drew attention
she says the right issue is whether job *rewards* compensate for stress
people who take on stressful jobs that help others report *satisfaction* , she says
