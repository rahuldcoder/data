@entity0 was supposed to go quickly and painlessly , when the @entity1 put him to death by lethal injection on wednesday			1
it took nearly two hours for him to die			1
journalists called to witness the execution said it was hard to watch , as @entity0 snorted and gasped			1
one described it like a " fish on shore gulping for air			2
" @entity1 officials defended the procedure , saying that the proper protocols were followed			2
@entity16 has compiled a list of @entity19 executions between 1982 and 2006 , which it considers " botched			2
" it 's hard to spot an example on that list of an execution that drew out nearly as long as @entity0 's did			1
his lawyers call it a violation of his @entity29 rights against " cruel and unusual punishment			2
" they severely criticized the novel combination of two drugs used in the procedure			1
@entity0 's slow death on wednesday is fueling a debate that has kicked up as states try out new drug alternatives for lethal injection , after the sole @entity19 manufacturer stopped making a key drug previously used			1
here are some answers to basic questions about the controversy surrounding the new drug combinations			1
what drug combination did @entity1 use ? @entity46 , which is an anesthetic used sometimes in surgery , and hydromorphone , a narcotic pain killer , commonly known by its brand name @entity52			1
the anesthetic is thought to render the inmate unconscious for the execution			2
an overdose of hydromorphone causes death by shutting down breathing and stopping the heart from beating			1
lethal injections usually proceed in stages , with one drug injected first , another second and , in some cases , a third drug last			1
all of them in high doses			2
a very common combination has traditionally involved three drugs : -- an anesthetic to make the inmate unconscious			1
-- then a paralyzing agent to keep him or her from flailing			2
-- then a third drug , often potassium chloride , to stop the heart			0
some states feel that overdoses of two drugs are enough , and there is a new movement afoot in some states to reduce it to a single drug , according to @entity83			1
in @entity1 , on wednesday , @entity0 received the midazolam first , then the hydromorphone			1
why is the new combination controversial ? the controversy surrounding the relatively new combination seems to center more on midazolam			1
two other recent executions that appeared to turn ugly had it as an ingredient : -- @entity92 started wheezing after receiving both drugs in @entity95 in january			1
he gasped , and his chest and stomach heaved , a journalist witness said			0
he made choking sounds and clenched his fists			0
@entity92 had been convicted of rape and murder			0
-- @entity103 injected @entity104 with midazolam in april			1
but instead of becoming unconscious , he twitched , convulsed and spoke			0
the execution was halted , but @entity104 died anyhow after 43 minutes			0
officials blamed the botched execution on a burst vein			0
@entity104 had been convicted of murder			0
before @entity92 received the combination , experts warned of the possible adverse reaction			1
and according to the @entity116 , midazolam 's side effects can include uncontrollable shaking , seizures and difficulty breathing			0
why the new drug combinations ? for years -- in the three - drug method mentioned above -- sodium thiopental was injected first as the anesthetic , but its sole @entity19 manufacturer , @entity125 based @entity124 , stopped producing it			2
in 2011 , it entered into a production deal in @entity129 , where the death penalty is illegal , and the company had to promise its product would not be used in the @entity19 for executions			2
since it felt it could n't guarantee that , it shut down the production			0
the @entity137 has banned its manufacturers from exporting sodium thiopental to the @entity19 for the same reason			0
did executions work well with the previous drug ? @entity143 has not been able to find cases , in which the administration of previous execution drug combinations led to such prolonged deaths , but the use of sodium thiopental has also found its critics			0
they have attacked the drug itself and also question the professionalism of its application			0
scientists from the @entity158 have said that the anesthesia does n't last long enough , and as a result , an inmate may become alert during the execution			0
but the paralyzing agent administered after the anesthetic may prevent him or her from letting anyone know that he or she is awake			0
the inmate may be silent and still but experience the administration of the third , deadly drug consciously			0
" it would be a cruel way to die , " they wrote , " awake , paralyzed , unable to move , to breathe , while potassium burned through your veins			2
" the scientists also have complained that executioners had no training in anesthesia			0
the three - drug method was developed by an medical examiner in @entity103 and passed on to prison personnel , they said			0
the result , the scientists fear , is inmates suffering through their executions eyes wide opened			0

@entity0 was supposed to die quickly and painlessly
but he stayed alive for two hours after being injected with a novel combination of drugs
his protracted death has *stirred* controversy over states looking for new lethal drugs
