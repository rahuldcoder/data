surprise , surprise , @entity2 and @entity3 are still not getting along			1
fortunately , the battles have been strictly rhetorical , although both nations ' military vessels and aircraft have navigated and scrambled ominously in the vicinity of the disputed islets in the @entity10 known as the @entity12 islands in @entity3 and the senkakus in @entity2			1
but the bilateral spat could easily escalate over a miscalculation by officers on the scene			0
it 's easy to forget that last week the two nations marked the 35th anniversary of the @entity21			0
under the circumstances , the lack of fanfare is understandable but it does seem a timely reminder of what might be possible			0
while diplomacy has not been effective yet in reviving that spirit of amity , damping down tensions , or in securing a meeting between president @entity32 and prime minister @entity33 , finding a formula to execute a mutually acceptable climb down is essential to jump - start dialogue			0
leaders of nations can help by shelving the bombast			0
dialogue continues behind the scenes but this is against the backdrop of frosty admonitions and dangerous posturing			0
is it possible to dial down the rhetoric and serve up a summit ? not anytime soon			0
last month , president @entity32 warned @entity2 about its truculent stance on the disputed territories and , along with @entity52 president @entity51 , cold - shouldered prime minister @entity33 at regional conferences in october			1
@entity33 has stayed away from the @entity55 -- a controversial monument to @entity2 's war dead -- but this olive branch has not been seized , and advisers say he will visit by the year 's end , ensuring the impasse continues			1
opinion : @entity2 honoring the dead or insulting the neighbors ? there is a lot to worry about with this face off in the @entity10 , especially now that it has become laden with nationalist symbolism and the game of military " chicken " intensifies			1
for example , in february @entity2 claimed that a @entity3 vessel locked its firing radar onto a @entity2 ship			1
more recently a @entity3 drone ventured into the disputed airspace , prompting @entity77 to warn that it would fire on subsequent drones if they ignore warnings to leave @entity2 's air defense identification space			1
@entity3 's response was blunt			2
" if @entity2 takes enforcement measures such as shooting down aircraft , as it says it will , that would constitute a serious provocation , an act of war of sorts , and we would have to take firm countermeasures , and all consequences would be the responsibility of the side that caused the provocation , " a defense ministry spokesman warned earlier this week			1
@entity33 issued his own warning in an interview with the @entity100 on the same day , saying @entity2 would adopt a more assertive security posture and reassert its regional influence			2
" there are concerns that @entity3 is attempting to change the status quo by force , rather than by rule of law			2
but if @entity3 opts to take that path , then it wo n't be able to emerge peacefully , " he said			2
subsequently , while reviewing @entity2 's @entity110 last weekend , @entity33 said , " we will express our intention as a state not to tolerate a change in the status quo by force			2
we must conduct all sorts of activities such as surveillance and intelligence for that purpose			0
" the security environment surrounding @entity2 is becoming increasingly severe			2
you will have to completely rid yourselves of the conventional notion that just the existence of a defense force could act as a deterrent			0
" referring to the security implications of " @entity130 , " which refers to the prime minister 's brand of economic policies designed to revitalize a stagnant economy , @entity33 believes a resurgent @entity2 should play a more assertive leadership role in @entity136 to counter @entity3 's power in a region nervous about @entity140 's military buildup , and fears about @entity143 's fitful engagement			1
obviously , @entity3 disagrees about what the region expects and needs , believing that over time it will gain regional hegemony			1
@entity143 , meanwhile , is betting on a " cooler heads prevail " scenario and certainly does n't want to go to war with @entity3 over the rocky islets			1
but the @entity151 - pivot , still waiting to happen , looks like a neo-containment policy , as does the exclusion of @entity3 from the @entity155 negotiations			2
recent @entity157 - @entity2 joint amphibious landing drills may be a sensible precaution , but also they also contribute to the tit - for - tat cycle of provocations that roil regional relations			1
the nonprofit think tank @entity162 conducts an annual public opinion poll in both nations and this summer found that mutual perceptions are extremely negative , exceeding 90 % in both countries			0
this is the worst result in nine years of polling and should serve as a wake up call for leaders in @entity140 and @entity77			0
it 's time to show some real leadership			0
but not everyone is glowering			0
@entity162 hosted a bilateral conference in @entity140 this past weekend featuring dozens of prominent experts , officials and politicians , aimed at promoting dialogue			0
former @entity2 prime minister @entity179 ( 2007 - 08 ) advised leaders to avoid the dead - end of self - righteousness			2
he also urged @entity2 to " overcome historical problems " relating to its past aggression in @entity136 to regain dignity and meet international expectations			1
given the urgent need for bilateral cooperation on a number of issues , @entity179 said it 's time to act now to overcome differences and find common ground			1
@entity194 advice , but in the feverish flexing of patriotic impulses , are current leaders listening ?			0

tensions between @entity3 and @entity2 have been heightened in recent weeks
the focal point of their spat is an island chain in the @entity10 that both claim
@entity3 warned that @entity2 *threat* to shoot down its *unmanned* drones an act of war
