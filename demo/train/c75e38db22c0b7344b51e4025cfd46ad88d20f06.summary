-- @entity1 came home from school one day to find her world turned upside down			1
her mom had suffered a massive heart attack ; doctors said she would need weeks to recover			0
in a matter of minutes , the 14 - year - old went from child to child caregiver			1
@entity1 spent the next month bathing , dressing and feeding her mom before school			1
when she got home , she cleaned the house and made dinner			0
her dad helped when he could , but he worked long hours to support the family			2
two years later , @entity1 had to do it all again when her mom had another heart attack			0
and then again when a third heart attack hit two years after that			0
in between , @entity1 tried to be a normal teen			0
but the time she spent living in fear of losing her mom had a lasting impact			0
" i felt that getting married and having kids just would n't be right , because i was so sure i would have early heart disease like my mom , " said @entity1 , now an associate professor of psychology at @entity28			2
" i did n't want to put a husband and children through that experience			2
" it 's difficult to say how many child caregivers there are in the @entity38			1
the only national survey on the topic , a 2005 report by the @entity42 for @entity44 ( @entity43 ) , estimated that there were at least 1.3 million between the ages of 8 and 18 -- most caring for a parent or grandparent , some looking after a sibling			1
child caregivers in the @entity38 have largely been ignored , says @entity52 , director of families and health care at the @entity55			1
while a few people , such as @entity58 @entity59 , are working on a local level to support kids in these circumstances , a national push has n't been forthcoming			1
" these children suffer silently behind closed doors			1
... they do n't have the help and the support and the recognition that they need , " @entity59 said			2
who should be @entity71 ? cast your vote is it simply that people do n't know that child caregivers exist , @entity74 wonders , or are they ignoring the problem because they do n't know how to help ? " people do n't want to think of children providing care , " @entity74 said			1
" for whatever reason , it suits people not to see it			0
" more studies have been done in @entity85 and the @entity86 , giving experts some insight on the lives of these children			1
from administering medication to providing emotional support , being a caregiver can prove exhausting , especially for a child who 's still in school			1
these studies abroad have shown that child caregivers are more likely to fall asleep in class and fall behind on assignments			1
the children are often socially isolated too because they do n't have time to hang out or ca n't bring friends home			2
" kids do n't want to be singled out , " @entity74 said			2
" they 're very afraid of being different			0
being a caregiver is being different			0
" the long - term effects of being a child caregiver are n't well studied			2
@entity74 has seen these kids grow up to be mature , responsible adults who are closely connected to their families			2
they show evidence of having high self - esteem , more empathy and a strong sense of belonging			2
many she knows have gone into the health - care industry or social work so they can continue to care for others			2
but she says her organization does n't see the child caregivers who get lost , the ones who wind up in jail or on the streets because they had too much to deal with at home			1
a 2012 study published in the @entity125 analyzed data from 1,200 students in two @entity129 school districts			2
researchers found that child caregivers were at a significantly higher risk for anxiety and depression			1
@entity135 , ceo of the @entity136 , says many child caregivers develop behavioral problems ; boys in particular exhibit aggressive and antisocial tendencies			1
according to a 2006 study ( @entity43 ) , 22 % of high school dropouts in the @entity38 leave school to care for a family member			1
many continue to care for their loved ones into adulthood , @entity135 says			0
some , like @entity1 , resist getting -- or staying -- married			0
" i think sometimes it 's the forming of relationships , " @entity135 said			0
" something about that issue has made it difficult for them			0
" @entity1 is hoping to do more studies on child caregivers and the long - term effects they face			1
she 's working with @entity74 , @entity59 and @entity135 to spread the word about this hidden population			0
" it is n't going to go away , " @entity1 said			0
" the issue will only get bigger			0
" @entity135 says that addressing the problem has to begin at home			0
many parents fear that their children will be taken away if they admit they 're being cared for			0
teachers also need to be taught , @entity135 says , to identify the children who are at risk			1
providing a local support network for kids who are " different " will help them feel less so			1
@entity74 says other countries have had great success with camp - like programs that give child caregivers a free day , weekend or week			1
it 's not therapy , she says , it 's just recreation time so that the kids can be kids			0
" these are our children , and we should be able to do something for them , " @entity74 said			0
" my guess is , it would n't take a whole lot to make a difference			0

survey estimates there are at least 1.3 million child caregivers in the @entity38
these children must handle *domestic* *duties* and provide *personal* care and support
studies show that these kids are at a higher risk for depression and often drop out of school
@entity58 @entity200 : they " suffer silently behind closed doors "
