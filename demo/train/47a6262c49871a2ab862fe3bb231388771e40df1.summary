makeover goal : i want to look like i got a great night 's sleep @entity4 says : the number - one question i get is ' how can i look less tired ? ' you have to know it 's a natural thing that happens to all of us as we ageâ € ” darkness under the eyes and blotchiness on the skin makes us look sleep - deprived			1
many women rely on concealer , but that alone is not enough			0
the key is to find a foundation , concealer , and corrector that all look natural			0
@entity0 : how to fake a good night 's sleep start with a corrector , a cream - based formula that brightens up discoloration under the eyes , either in a pinkish tone ( if your skin tone falls somewhere between @entity54 's and @entity55 's ) or a peachy shade ( if you 're darker than @entity55 )			1
then , right over that , apply concealer that 's one to two shades lighter than your skin			2
those two steps together will make dark circles disappear , but the reason @entity64 looks so evened - out in her " after " shot is that i followed up with a tinted moisturizer			2
i like it instead of foundation because it gives enough coverage , but you can still see her skin			2
to find your right shade , apply it to your cheek			0
if it disappears , you 've met your match ! @entity0 : makeup tips from @entity4 makeover goal : i want to play up my eyes			1

@entity90 is wearing a black gel liner along the top lashes and a powder liner on the bottom , plus lots of black mascara ( brown is too wimpyâ € ” i do n't even make it anymore ! )			0
going all out on eyes ? keep lips low - key with a pretty pink lipstick and sheer white gloss			0
@entity0 : tips to make your eyes pop makeover goal : i want to look more polished			1
@entity4 says : the best thing you can do to look instantly more put - together is to define your features			1
the brows are a great place to start , because they make such a difference to your face with so little effort			2
if your brows are sparse , like @entity115 's , go for a slanted , firm brush and an eye shadow that matches your brow color			1
starting at the eyebrows ' inner corner , use short , upward strokes , following your natural shape			0
it also helps to wear blush , particularly a cream formula , which gives a nice glow			0
pick a true pink if your skin is @entity115 's shade or lighter ; if you 're darker , try a plummy color			0
