last year , photographer @entity0 only released the shutter on his large - format camera about 100 , maybe 150 times			1
it 's typical for him and the hulking @entity6 8x10 he shoots with			2
it 's also perfect for the portraits he wants to capture			1
" my photographing process and intent are informing each other , " @entity0 said			1
" i 'm using a very large camera , which is a really slow , methodical , deliberate way of working			2
" he jokes that there 's no " decisive moment , " in the famous words of @entity17			2
for him , it 's a " decisive morning			2
" he likes that early light , and the pace his camera demands			0
he might ask a subject to join him for breakfast in his backyard in the @entity26 neighborhood of @entity27 , @entity28			1
between setup and shooting , they often spend a few hours getting to know each other over coffee or beer or catching up on the months they 've missed each other			0
" i am not only completely dependent on my gear , i 'm beholden to it , " @entity0 wrote in an essay to be published later this year			1
" i do not operate my camera , i collaborate with it			0
" the essay is part of " contact , " a book of @entity0 's portraits to be released in april by one twelve publishing			1
it will debut during @entity48 , alongside an exhibition of @entity0 's work at @entity27 's @entity51			1
" contact " was funded through a @entity53 campaign that drew more than $ 23,000 -- far more than its $ 18,500 goal			1
it was " crickets and coyotes " at first , @entity0 said , but as the funding deadline approached , support swelled			2
it came from photo enthusiasts , art lovers , friends , neighbors and customers of @entity27 's @entity67 , where @entity0 holds a day job			1
some supporters ' images will appear in the book ; those " friends and heroes and people for whom i have affection " are among those who inspire his work and keep it going			0
social media follow @ @entity78 on @entity79 to join the conversation about photography			0
" it 's @entity27 that made it possible , " @entity0 said			1
" i 've never been in a place where i 've been surrounded by so many interesting and productive individuals			0
" just as he likes to take his time and get to know people , he prefers to photograph them at what they love			0
that 's why his images capture a jazz singer posed in a @entity94 and a seamstress beside a dress form dialed to just her size			0
there 's a man who works for the children 's museum , partly dressed in a robot costume he made , standing beside his father and the @entity105 trailer he 's working on			0
there are people wearing the garb of their everyday lives , whether it 's blue jeans or a clown costume donned for a short film			0
" the figures , " @entity0 said , " are both sort of part of the environments and the narrative			2
" or , as he wrote , " somewhere between hopeful acquaintance and profound intimacy is where all of my portraits are made			0
" @entity0 is a portraitist based in @entity27 , @entity28			1
you can follow his work on @entity127 .			0

photographer @entity0 's large - format portraits are set to appear in a new book
many of the subjects are from his *hometown* of @entity27 , @entity28
the book , " contact , " was funded through a @entity53 campaign
