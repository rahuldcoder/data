they 've been called " blood phones			0
" it 's a reference to the fact that some metals used to make smartphones and other electronic gadgets are sourced from war - torn areas of the @entity8			1
experts say these " conflict minerals " help fuel one of the world 's deadliest conflicts			1
an estimated 5.4 million people have died there from war - related causes , including disease and malnutrition , since 1998 , according to the @entity19			0
but according to a report released thursday by the @entity22 , an advocacy group , metals from the @entity8 are getting less bloody			1
that 's thanks in part to the fact that tech companies like @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 have made efforts to trace the source of metals used in their devices			1
an auditing system for smelters , the industrial facilities that process raw metals , also has been put in place			2
a certification system is in the works that would allow companies to certify some metals from @entity8 as " conflict free			1
" other tech companies , however , like @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 , received low rankings from the group			1
@entity47 was the only company out of 24 ranked by the @entity22 that received a score of zero , for taking no steps to ensure that its electronics do not support armed groups in @entity59			1
" @entity47 is , i believe , the only company that has basically refused to acknowledge the issue or demonstrate they are making any sort of effort on it , " said @entity60 , senior policy analyst at the @entity22			1
" and this is despite a good two years of trying to get in contact with them			0
" in a statement issued to @entity70 , @entity47 said it " outsources the manufacture and assembly of all @entity47 products to our production partners and therefore is not directly involved in the sourcing of raw materials that are ultimately used in our products			2
" the company added : " we nonetheless take our social responsibilities as a global company very seriously and expect our production partners to do the same			0
" a @entity47 spokeswoman declined to comment on conflict minerals specifically			1
other companies saw their scores improve from a similar report in 2010			2
@entity27 ranked highest on the @entity22 's list with a score of 60 , meaning it has taken 60 % of the steps recommended by the group to ensure it is responsibly tracking conflict minerals			1
that 's up from a score of 24 in 2010			2
@entity31 and @entity30 both scored 38 , up from 13 and 15 , respectively			0
@entity96 scored 35 , up from 19			0
@entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 received scores of 27			0
three of those companies had received scores lower than 10 in the previous @entity22 ranking			0
the report says there is still much to be done , however			0
" despite the progress made in the past year by both governments and industry , a long road still lies ahead , " the group says in its report , titled " taking conflict out of @entity111			2
" " exploitation of @entity8 's mineral resources continues to exacerbate conflict and instability on the ground and consumers are still largely in the dark as to whether or not their products are conflict free			2
" it will take a holistic effort by multiple governments and industries to regulate the flow of illegal conflict minerals			1
the driver of that effort must remain the demand of the conscious consumer			0
" the @entity22 says the results are already apparent on the ground in the @entity8			2
the amount of money armed groups make off three of the main conflict minerals ( tin , tantalum and tungsten ) has dropped 65 % over the past two years , according to a report released earlier this month , which attributes the decrease both to the efforts of the tech industry and to new legislation			1
a rule tucked into 2010 financial reform legislation in the @entity150 may soon require companies to disclose whether they source metals form conflict zones			2
the @entity154 is expected to vote on those rules concerning conflict minerals on august 22			1
some business groups , including the @entity150 @entity158 , say the @entity154 should reconsider the rules because they are too expensive or complex to implement			0
four metals -- gold , tin , tantalum and tungsten -- are used in gadgets and also are mined in the eastern @entity8 , a region of the vast country that has been in active conflict for years			1
armed groups have profited from mining these metals , holding some workers at gunpoint and forcing them to work for little or no pay , according to the group @entity172			0
new certifications systems , however , aim to attach bar codes to packages of @entity8 metals that have been certified as conflict - free			1
the @entity22 also says there are efforts to differentiate @entity8 metals from others by their color and other physical properties			1
the growth of a rebel group called @entity187 and ongoing gold smuggling threaten to further destabilize the mining industry , the report says			0
companies once were " turning a blind eye to where they 're getting their materials from , " said @entity60			0
but after considerable pressure from advocacy groups and college students , more of them have become aware of the issue			0
" @entity200 , " he said , " is the best disinfectant			0

report : tech companies are making progress on ' conflict minerals '
the term refers to metals that come from the @entity8
metals used in gadgets are said to fuel *violence* in that country
while many make progress , the report gives @entity47 a score of zero
