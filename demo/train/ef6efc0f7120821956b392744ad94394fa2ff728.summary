-- @entity1 scored his third goal in as many games to continue his return to form and lift @entity5 to the top of @entity8 's @entity7 on saturday night			1

@entity5 coach @entity49 brought on @entity29 for @entity50 seven minutes after the break , and @entity30 replaced @entity52 around the hour mark			0
the move worked as @entity1 pounced to score his 15th goal this season from close range in the 63rd minute after @entity58 deflected @entity30 's corner at his own goalkeeper , and @entity42 could only manage a reflex block			2
@entity42 did well to tip over a fierce @entity29 drive , and the in - form @entity63 forward -- named the world 's highest - earning player during the week -- should have doubled @entity5 's lead but surprisingly fired well over the bar			2
the @entity68 then played out for time to clinch a 26th clean sheet this season for goalkeeper @entity72			0
@entity13 can lose fourth place if @entity74 win at @entity75 on sunday			0

the giant @entity88 was given a rare start in place of star striker @entity91 , but was given an early bath after making an awkward lunge at a defender			0
@entity96 @entity95 doubled the lead with a goal against his former club in the 63rd minute after @entity101 's fine long pass helped him beat the offside trap , and @entity103 made it 3 - 0 eight minutes later as he stuck out a leg to divert a corner into the net			1
the win lifted @entity78 four points clear of the relegation zone , with third - bottom @entity111 coming from behind to draw 1 - 1 at @entity112 in the early match .			1
