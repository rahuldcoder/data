-- as criticism of his war on organized crime mounts , @entity2 president @entity1 is under increasing pressure to introduce a new security policy			1
@entity1 , who announced a crackdown on cartels shortly after taking office in 2006 , has asked his country 's congress to approve fresh measures to help in the fight			1
police reforms are a key target of his administration			2
" our primary objective is to ensure that no matter who governs or which party he belongs , the @entity2 are protected by an honest and professional police , by an effective and transparent justice system , " @entity1 told his nation 's security council when he announced the proposed reforms in june			1
but taking a new tack in the controversial drug war may be difficult for @entity1 , as vocal politicians express their skepticism			1
the president 's political future -- and @entity2 's security -- hang in the balance			0
@entity1 , whose term ends in 2012 , has proposed a plan to eliminate more than 2,000 local police forces , combine them with state law enforcement agencies and unite them under federal control			1
he and his top security officials have argued that the move will better combat corruption and crime			1
" this initiative is a response to the people 's demand to have reliable police , and the necessity to strengthen the institutions of security in order to face the criminals that plague @entity2 , " he said earlier this year			2
federal officials have said the lower salaries of local police officers make them more susceptible to corruption			2
more than half of them receive monthly salaries of only 4,000 pesos ( about $ 325 )			0
government estimates indicate that corruption has caused the dismissal of 3,000 police officers in recent years			0
while some lawmakers support the reform , others are critical of the current strategy , which has the @entity2 military as the principal enforcers of public security			0
@entity1 's government has dispatched about 50,000 troops to the nation 's trouble spots			1
" the big question for us in congress is , ' how long we will have armed forces at the forefront of the fight ? ' " lawmaker @entity76 said			1
@entity1 has said the military will not retreat in the short term , but a police overhaul would be a key step in guaranteeing security			1
@entity2 secretary of public security @entity88 has also proposed eliminating 2,000 local councils to strengthen security in areas with a strong presence of organized crime			0
but some @entity2 politicians have said they are skeptical that such reforms will do much to combat corruption			1
@entity97 of the left - wing @entity98 has suggested the legislation would only be financially profitable for certain parties within congress and politically advantageous for certain officials , principally that of @entity1 's right - wing @entity104			2
" so basically what 's in this [ legislation ] is something that is in the interest of the local mayors , who are not from the same party as the governors , " he said			0
meanwhile , @entity1 's administration has said it is dealing severe blows to organized crime , citing such examples as the seizure of an estimated $ 12 billion in drugs			1
the @entity2 navy has also had high profile takedowns of drug kingpins , including the capture of @entity123 - born cartel boss @entity122 alias " @entity124			0
" but with persistent public perception about drug cartels gaining ground , @entity1 has a tough battle to fight before his term ends in 2012			2
a top official in @entity2 's opposition @entity132 has said the war on drugs can not succeed if it remains a " fight of firepower between criminals and the state			0
" @entity2 's government must create jobs and improve education to help fight drug trafficking , sen. @entity139 said			0
" we have seen 30,000 people die in the past four years , " he said			0
" and we are very close to seeing , at the end of this six - year term , an equal number of dead as in the @entity149			0
" @entity0 's @entity150 and @entity151 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 wants to overhaul the nation 's police
some politicians are skeptical of the proposed reforms
" how long will we have armed forces at the forefront of the fight ? " one lawmaker asks
@entity1 says the changes are necessary to combat crime and corruption
