@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the hours after a 2005 refinery explosion that left 15 people dead , a @entity4 executive suggested a holiday weekend and the national furor over a @entity9 woman 's last days would eclipse the tragedy			1
with the oil company now battling to save an image tarnished by the worst oil spill in @entity15 history , the lawyer who found that e-mail among a mountain of @entity4 documents says nothing appears to have changed			1
" their strategy is the same every time ... and it 's always , first , damage control , " @entity23 told @entity2			1
" and with damage control , they accentuate the positive , downplay the negative , tell everybody they 're sorry , they 're gon na fix it , they 're gon na do better , and not to worry			1
" @entity23 represented many of the victims of the march 2005 explosion at @entity4 's refinery in @entity37 , near @entity0			1
the blast killed 15 workers and injured 180 , with many of the survivors suffering severe burns , amputations and broken bones			0
during litigation that followed , @entity23 extracted about 7 million documents from the company , including the e-mail that discussed whether the upcoming @entity49 weekend would push the explosion off the public stage			1
@entity53 blog : @entity55 e-mail shows how @entity4 handles a crisis " looks like injuries and loss of life are heavy			1
expect a lot of follow up coverage tomorrow			0
then i believe it will essentially go away -- due to the holiday weekend , " @entity64 public relations chief @entity63 advised other executives			1
@entity67 added , " this is a very big story in the @entity15 right now -- but the @entity70 story is huge as well			0
" read the email @entity70 was the severely brain - damaged @entity9 woman whose case became the centerpiece of a national right - to - die battle , and the controversy was reaching a climax just as the @entity37 explosion occurred			0
@entity23 said the document made him " sick to my stomach			0
" but he says the stacks of paper , e-mails and slides uncovered after the @entity37 blast offer a rare insight into the culture of @entity4 and may take on a new meaning in light of the massive @entity90 spill			1
@entity4 is now under fire for its failure to shut down a ruptured undersea well in the @entity90 , a spill that now dwarfs the 1989 grounding of the @entity96 in @entity98 's @entity97			1
critics say it has downplayed the scale of the disaster , underreported the amount of oil leaking and is trying to keep images of the gusher under wraps			0
with its stock plummeting and the environmentally friendly image it spent years cultivating taking a beating , the company has taken out full - page newspaper ads and aired television spots in which ceo @entity113 apologizes for the spill and vows , " we will make this right			0
" but @entity23 said @entity4 appears to be following " the same course of conduct " it did after @entity37			2
" i do n't think there 's a shred of evidence in @entity4 's favor that shows that they 've done anything to change their corporate safety culture , " he said			1
@entity4 has not responded to multiple requests for interviews with either ceo @entity113 or another executive familiar with the @entity37 documents			1
at least four of the people included on @entity67 's e-mail are still working as spokespeople for @entity4 , @entity2 has found			1
the @entity90 spill began when the drilling platform @entity136 , owned by @entity4 contractor @entity137 , blew up and sank off @entity138 , taking 11 workers with it			1
@entity4 , @entity137 and oilfield services contractor @entity141 all have pointed fingers at each other in hearings in @entity145 and in @entity146			2
@entity23 says the documents his law firm unearthed in the @entity37 case showed @entity4 employees warned that corners at the plant were being cut , and dangerous conditions were being ignored			1
" quit waiting for a known possible disaster to happen before correcting the problem , " one worker wrote			0
another stated , " this company deliberately put my life in danger to try and save a buck			0
" a third complained , " if this facility was an aircraft carrier , we would be at the bottom of the ocean			0
" @entity4 employees ' comments " what was shocking was that we did n't just find that smoking gun , " @entity23 said			2
" we found an entire arsenal			0
you could have fitted an army with all of the smoking guns that we found in this			0
" also among the documents that turned up in the lawsuit was a guide to filling out incident reports , created by lawyers hired by @entity4 , that urged workers to " avoid language that is negative , inflammatory or implies criminal intent or willful misconduct			2
" coon dubbed one slide from the @entity4 presentation the " dirty words document , " which tells workers to avoid terms like " reckless , " " careless " or " incompetent			2
" " they do n't want to have anything in any of their reports or anything in writing that indicates that they did anything wrong , " he said			0
the @entity37 blast killed 15 @entity4 contractors who were housed in a trailer near the site of the explosion , which originated with equipment used to boost the octane levels in gasoline			2
in 2007 , @entity4 pleaded guilty to a felony , agreed to pay $ 21 million in fines from the @entity211 and paid another $ 50 million in criminal penalties in connection with the disaster			2
the plea agreement required the company to fix the problems that led to the explosion			0
but when that did n't happen , they fined @entity4 again in 2009 -- an $ 87 million proposed penalty that would be the largest in the agency 's history if upheld			1
@entity4 is contesting those citations and the assessed penalties			2
@entity23 said the @entity37 case shows @entity4 " has a lot of systemic problems that they are never going to change unless somebody makes them change			0
" " if they do n't make them change , something worse is going to happen , " he said			0
" and it wo n't be that long			0
