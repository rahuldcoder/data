the elder @entity7 received a 23 - year sentence in 1997 after pleading guilty to spying for @entity16 , one year after he was arrested at @entity18 outside @entity19 while attempting to board a flight to @entity21			1
federal prosecutors said that at the time of his arrest , @entity7 was carrying 10 rolls of film of classified documents as well as coded messages on a computer disk			2
they said he planned to meet his @entity16 handlers , who would pay him more than $ 180,000			2
but his covert , and profitable , relationship with the @entity16 did not end while he was imprisoned at the @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity10			1
@entity7 admitted as much in november , when -- 21 months after being indicted again -- he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government and conspiracy to commit international money laundering as part of an agreement with federal prosecutors			2
at that hearing , the 16 - year former @entity3 station chief confessed to working with his son , @entity44 , to funnel information to and get money from the @entity16 government between 2006 and december 2008			1
@entity7 could have faced 25 years in prison and $ 750,000 in fines for both crimes			1
but instead , he will have eight years tacked onto his existing sentence per the plea deal , a statement from the @entity54 attorney 's office in @entity10 said			1
according to court documents , @entity57 , 26 , cooperated with prosecutors in their case against his father after @entity63 agents confronted him about frequent international travel			0
the younger @entity7 , a former @entity65 paratrooper , admitted to authorities during the @entity63 questioning that he had not gone overseas to visit " a battle buddy " as he had claimed previously			1
@entity63 agents then informed @entity7 that lying to them was a federal crime and offered him a chance to change his story , according to one agent 's testimony			2
at that point , @entity63 special agent @entity73 testified , @entity7 became more " forthcoming			0
" @entity57 told the agents that at his father 's behest , he made trips to @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 , where he met with @entity16 government representatives who gave him payments totaling more than $ 35,000 in cash			0
during @entity57 's prison visits to his father , according to court records , " @entity7 spent a significant amount of time advising ( the ) defendant on how to conduct himself in a clandestine manner as he traveled to and from various international meeting locations			0
@entity7 tried to impart his @entity3 training to ( the ) defendant			1
" prosecutors alleged the @entity16 gave the elder @entity7 back - pay for his prior espionage activities and for details on how he was caught			1
" the @entity16 was specifically interested in how @entity7 got caught by the @entity63 , " according to a government sentencing memo filed with the court			1
it added that the information concerned " who interrogated him after his arrest and the timing of his transfers as a @entity3 officer prior to his arrest			0
" according to court records , the elder @entity7 and his son put the plot into motion after @entity57 complained to his father about the family 's precarious finances			0
the sentencing memo said that @entity57 provided crucial help in the prosecution of his father			0
the elder @entity7 pleaded guilty on the day that his trial was set to have begun last month and who now faces an additional 20 years in prison			2
in an october psychological report entered into the court record by prosecutors , @entity57 took aim at his ex-spy father			0
" i was n't aware of his selfish side , " @entity57 said , according to the records			0
" i allowed myself to be blindsided			0
i was like a lobster in a pot , heated slowly until it was too late			0
" @entity0 's @entity136 contributed to this report .			0
