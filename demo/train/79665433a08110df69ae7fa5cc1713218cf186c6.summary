-- a @entity2 man who spent more than 20 years on death row saw his murder conviction and death sentence reversed by the state @entity7 monday , according to court documents			1
@entity9 , 41 , was sentenced to death for the 1991 murder of liquor store clerk @entity12			1
@entity14 justices ruled that prosecutors withheld critical and potentially exculpatory information during the 1992 trial that violated his right to due process , entitling @entity9 to a retrial			1
the suppression of such information " creates a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different if the exculpatory and impeachment evidence had been disclosed , " wrote justice @entity22 in the decision			0
" accordingly , we must reverse @entity9 's conviction and death sentence and remand for a new trial			1
" @entity12 was fatally shot while working at the @entity33 , a tavern and liquor store located on governor @entity35 near @entity37 , the evening of january 14 , 1991			0
a co-worker and customer witnessed two men entering and leaving the liquor store at the time and found @entity12 slumped over the counter in a pool of blood			0
@entity9 was arrested and interrogated after police received an anonymous tip that appeared to indicate that @entity9 was involved in the killing , court documents said			2
four of @entity9 's friends testified that @entity9 had spent the evening of the crime with them , and eyewitnesses were unable to recognize @entity9 as one of the men they saw enter the liquor store , but a jury still convicted the then - 18 - year - old defendant of first degree murder , first degree robbery , and related weapons charges			1
the conviction was based largely on a videotaped confession given by @entity9 and the testimony of a surprise witness and fellow prisoner who said that @entity9 admitted to him that he shot @entity12 , court documents said			2
this is not the first reversal @entity9 's case has seen			2
in 2012 , the @entity70 vacated @entity9 's conviction and sentence because it had " no confidence in the outcome of the trial			1
" the @entity70 found that prosecutors failed to disclose information about a similar attempted robbery at a nearby liquor store less than an hour before the @entity33 robbery by suspects matching the description given by eyewitnesses			2
a similar weapon was also used at both locations			0
additionally , it was discovered that @entity9 was not properly read his @entity88 rights at the time of his arrest , according to the @entity70 decision			2
but the @entity7 reversed that opinion and reinstated @entity9 's conviction and death sentence on the grounds that the information about the other robbery would not have affected the outcome given @entity9 's videotaped confession , court documents said			1
after the 2012 reinstatement of his conviction and death sentence , @entity9 's attorneys argued that prosecutors withheld additional critical information , particularly that the surprise witness who testified that @entity9 had confessed had a history of cooperating with prosecutors in exchange for reduced charges			1
@entity9 's attorneys argued that this information would have been helpful to the jury in determining the credibility of the witness 's testimony			2
additional testimony by a trial witness also was called into question , according to court documents			0
@entity9 's attorneys suggested that the witness may have actually committed the crime			0
attorneys for @entity9 also argued that the main evidence for @entity9 's 1992 conviction , his video confession , was given when @entity9 was barely 18 years old , was severely sleep deprived and under the influence of heroin , court documents say			1
the @entity129 found monday that the cumulative effect of the suppression of the additional information was enough to vacate @entity9 's conviction and death sentence and demand a retrial			1
@entity136 , one of @entity9 's attorneys , wrote in a statement : " as the @entity7 found , not a shred of forensic or eyewitness evidence ties mr. @entity9 to the crime , and , in violation of mr. @entity9 's constitutional rights , evidence was illegally suppressed in the case ... [ @entity145 ] he only evidence against mr. @entity9 was a false confession , a confession that was ' inaccurate , ' and squarely contradicted by the facts of the case			0
" @entity9 remains held at the @entity151 in @entity152 , @entity2 , according to a facility official			0
a date for retrial has not yet been set			0
@entity0 's request for comment from the delaware attorney general 's office was not immediately returned			0
@entity0 's @entity159 contributed to this report .			0
