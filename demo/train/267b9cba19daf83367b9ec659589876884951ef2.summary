-- @entity3 smartphone customers use 25 percent more data than @entity6 customers , thanks in large part to new @entity3 's new @entity10 smartphones , a recent study indicates			1
@entity11 , a company that analyzes cell phone bills and usage for consumers and corporate customers , analyzed 20,000 consumer phone bills between january and may of 2010 and discovered that @entity3 smartphone customers consume on average about 421 megabytes per month			1
meanwhile , @entity19 users consume roughly 25 percent less data , or about 338 megabytes per month			1
the full @entity11 report will be published on september 1			0
the comparison between smartphone data usage on @entity3 's network and @entity19 data usage on @entity6 's network is important to note , because @entity19 users have typically been viewed as the heaviest data users in the entire mobile market			1
the fact that @entity3 is seeing a major uptick in data usage in the past six months , largely due to new @entity10 smartphones , could be a key predictor of wireless data usage patterns going forward			1
if the trends continue , @entity3 could see an explosion in data usage			2
so far , @entity3 's network has n't faced any major hiccups due to the onslaught of new data traffic			1
this is in contrast to @entity6 's network , which , over the past three years since the @entity19 was launched , has beencriticized for dropping calls and offering slower than expected data download speedson their iphones in some parts of the country			1
" @entity3 's network is holding up really well as it adds more data traffic , " said @entity50 , chief analytics officer for @entity11			1
" @entity3 has always had a reputation for a solid network			2
and it looks like so far , it has been able to handle the additional traffic			0
" as @entity3 continues to sell more @entity10 devices , the carrier will likely put its network to the test even further			2
smartphone data usage started exploding for @entity3 when the company launched its first @entity10 phones in the fourth quarter last year , @entity50 said			2
with more @entity10 devices coming on the market in the next few months , it 's likely that the volume of @entity10 smartphones on @entity3 's network will increase			1
that said , the total number of cell phone customers -- including those using feature phones and smartphones -- using @entity3 data services is much less than the number of customers using these services on @entity6 's network			1
for example , 71.2 percent of all @entity6 cell phone subscribers , which includes users of smartphones like the @entity19 as well as feature phones , use data services , while only 43 percent of all @entity3 cell phone users subscribe to data services			1
even though fewer @entity3 cell phone subscribers are using data services , individually , they are consuming roughly the same amount of data each month as the average @entity6 customer			2
@entity6 cell phone subscribers , on average , consume @entity91 a month			0
the average @entity3 cell phone subscriber consumes about @entity93 of data per month			2
when it comes to smartphones , usage patterns between @entity6 and @entity3 customers are also similar			1
but @entity3 appears to have more power - users that fall in the midrange of data consumption			2
according to data analyzed by @entity11 , about half of @entity6 's @entity19 customers use less than @entity105 of data per month			1
and about 47 percent of their @entity19 subscribers use between @entity108 and @entity109 of data with about 90 percent of those customers using less than @entity112 of data per month			1
this means that about 2.5 percent of @entity6 's users consume more than @entity109 of data per month			1
hard - core data users @entity3 smartphone subscribers have similar usage patterns to those on @entity6 's network			1
but where they differ is in the number of subscribers that are using between @entity124 to @entity112 per month of data			0
@entity3 has twice as many of those customers than @entity6 has , @entity50 said			2
more than 11 percent of @entity3 smartphone users fall into this category , versus just 5.6 percent of @entity19 users			1
he speculates this difference is because @entity10 users tend to be more hard - core data users , whereas the @entity19 may be used more by casual users who like the phone because it 's cool			1
" the @entity19 makes much more of a lifestyle and social statement than an @entity10 phone makes , " @entity50 said			0
" people interested in an @entity10 are looking for horsepower			0
" in an effort to keep @entity19 data usage in check so it does n't completely overwhelm its network , @entity6 recently eliminated its all you - can - eat data plan			1
instead the company offers two tiers of services			0
for $ 15 a month , new smartphone subscribers can get up to @entity105 of data per month			0
and for $ 25 a month they can get @entity109 of data			0
@entity3 still offers its unlimited data plan			2
company executives emphasized that point at the launch of the new @entity157 earlier this summer			0
but executives have also said that @entity3 will eventually move to a tiered pricing model			0
@entity6 's new pricing only affects a small number of customers			0
but if @entity3 were to adopt the very same pricing model , more of its heavy data users on @entity10 phones would likely be affected			1
according to the @entity11 report , a little more than 4 percent of @entity3 's smartphone users consume more than @entity109 of data per month compared with only about 2.5 percent of @entity6 's @entity19 customers			1
@entity11 ' analysis also clearly shows that heavy data users are primarily using @entity6 and @entity3 , while customers who tend to use less data , are subscribing to @entity174 and @entity175			1
for example , about half of @entity174 's cell phone subscribers , including smartphone customers , use data on @entity174 's network			1
but the average usage is only about 133.4mb a month			0
@entity175 only has about 22.3 percent of its cell phone subscriber base subscribing to data , and those consumers are only using about @entity186 of data per month			0
@entity174 and @entity175 want a bigger piece of the data action , which is why the companies have been investing in next - generation networks			0
@entity174 is partnered with @entity191 , which is building its 4g network across the country using @entity194			0
@entity174 recently launched the first wimax - enabled phone that can switch between its 3g network and the @entity191 network			0
sales have been strong , but the company has suffered from component shortages making the devices hard to get			0
the @entity11 analysis does n't include the launch of this new phone , called the @entity205			0
so it will be interesting to note whether the launch of this device will significantly move the needle on data usage on @entity174 's network			1
meanwhile , @entity175 is also trying to strum up more data usage on its network by upgrading its network to the next generation of 3g technology called @entity217 +			0
but even with faster network speeds in some markets , @entity174 and @entity175 still lack the comprehensive coverage that @entity6 and @entity3 offer			2
the biggest problem for @entity174 and @entity175 is putting the right devices in the hands of the most prolific data users			2
" people who travel tend to be more mobile , and they also tend to be power users when it comes to mobile data , " @entity50 said			2
" they want to know that the coverage is there when they need it , and they 're generally more willing to pay for that			0
so they are definitely higher value customers			0
