-- goalkeeper @entity1 says the explosion of interest in soccer in the @entity5 is " mind - blowing " off the back of @entity9 's surprise progression from the @entity11 " @entity10 " to the last 16			1
few gave the @entity5 team much chance of finishing in the top two from the likes of @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , but it has defied the pundits to reach the knockout stages			2
@entity1 , who plays for @entity21 in the @entity22 , has been a key figure , making a string of fine saves to restrict group winners @entity16 to a 1 - 0 win thursday			1
it left @entity9 tied on four points with @entity17 , but qualifying for a match against @entity31 next tuesday because of a superior goal difference			1
the 35 - year - old veteran of 103 internationals had also been in top form as the @entity5 tied @entity17 2 - 2 in its second group match , building on its 2 - 1 win over @entity18 to start the tournament			2
the huge support in @entity40 , an estimated four times as many @entity5 fans as followed @entity42 's under achieving team , plus unprecedented scenes across @entity5 with fans crowding to watch games on big screens , has come as something of a surprise to @entity50 - born @entity1			1
" the fact that it has really swept the nation is incredible for us as @entity5 players to see that , " he told @entity0			2
" the interest has been mind - blowing and we 've enjoyed watching every second of @entity61 clips and @entity62 and @entity63 , " " we 've come so far in a short period of time			2
you know , the sport in our country really is n't that old , " he added			2
@entity1 also believes coach @entity70 has been vindicated for his selections after coming under fire before the start of the @entity11 for leaving out fan favorite @entity75 and picking four @entity77 - born players in his squad			1
" he 's from day one made a lot of bold , powerful decisions			0
some people call it cutthroat even , " he said			0
" but he 's strong in his decision making , and that 's what a leader has to be			0
" @entity70 said friday he was " optimistic " striker @entity88 will return from injury to play against @entity31 after sustaining a hamstring injury in the win over @entity18			1
another key player , midfielder @entity92 , has also been cleared to play despite breaking his nose in the narrow loss to @entity16			2
@entity1 believes they can provide another upset to beat @entity31 , which won all of its three group matches , building on the momentum of earlier performances			1
" we have a lot of other things we want to do , starting with @entity31 , but you know we 're proud of ourselves			1
" it was the @entity10 , and people did n't give us a lot of a chance			0
we have to believe we can do it , " he added			0
@entity1 -- who spent four years with @entity111 before transferring to @entity21 -- has become something of a cult hero , sporting a thick black beard in direct contrast to his shaven head			1
he had first grown it during the last @entity22 season and has changed his mind once or twice about its merits			0
" it was my strength			0
i loved it , and then i cut it			0
i just cut it because i was tired of it			0
" but i just decided to grow it back			0
there 's never a rhyme or reason when i decide to grow it			0
" @entity1 will be hoping it brings his side luck again when it faces @entity31 , looking to reach the quarterfinals of a @entity11 for the first time since 2002 .			1
