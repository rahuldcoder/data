-- ever imagined flying an airplane with your eyes closed ? or driving at nearly 200 miles an hour with a blindfold ? how about racing a speedboat in complete darkness ? sounds crazy ? well take off those blinkers and meet @entity8 -- the world 's fastest blind daredevil			1
on friday , @entity8 will attempt to break the blind water speed record in a powerboat just off the @entity13 coast and secure his place in history			1
being unable to see has proved no barrier to the 52 - year - old who is aiming to become the first man to hold the blind speed records for land , sea and air in the same year			1
having already succeeded on four wheels and in the cockpit of an airplane , it is just the sea which stands between him and sporting immortality			2
" to hold all the records would be amazing , " @entity8 told @entity0 , who is hoping to reach speeds of 95 miles an hour in a top of the range powerboat			1
" i first started riding motorcycles 12 years ago when i was pushing 40 and i just went from there			0
" i moved on to cars after that and i 've loved it			0
people love all types of different sports but for me it was always motorsport			0
" i love the engines , the smells , the noises which come with it			0
i love all the elements and just because i ca n't see , it does n't detract from the experience			0
" @entity8 's story is as rapid as it is remarkable			1
diagnosed with glaucoma as a child , @entity8 lost his sight at the age of eight			1
but it was not until some years later that he began his love affair with speed -- breaking blind land records on land and in the air			1
it was 12 years ago that he first attempted to break a record -- riding a motorcycle at 89 mph after just three days practice			1
he twice broke blind land speed records in 2003 and 2005 , improving from 144mph to 175mph in the space of two years			1
in october 2011 he achieved the world blind aerial aerobatic record ; flying the most consecutive loops in formation			1
a five times @entity75 holder , there is n't much @entity8 ca n't do			1
his charity is now helping others to overcome their difficulties through racing with his team having recently designed and built ten specially adapted track cars boasting dual controls , twin steering wheels			0
" the main point of all of this is to make sure that people who are n't able to have these opportunities get that chance , " added @entity8			1
" the charity is doing a great job and although we 're only quite young we 've made great progress			0
" i ca n't believe the amount of attention we 've had			0
hopefully it will continue for a while yet			0
" there will be hundreds of people present for @entity8 's latest record attempt with television cameras , journalists and photographers all ready to capture the moment			1
his exploits have made him into something of a celebrity -- a tag of which he 's not too keen on			0
that he is blind is not an issue to him -- what everyone else thinks is up to them			2
" whatever i attempt , i do it in my own environment , " @entity8 told @entity0			2
" if i get on the bus , go to the post office or the supermarket , i 'm doing it in my own environment and it 's normal for me			0
" being blind does n't stop me doing things			2
i do n't really think about being a role model or if i 've broken down barriers			0
i 'm just doing this to help other people in life			0
" @entity122 , the team principal , has worked with @entity8 for over a decade and has watched his friend and colleague meet each challenge head on without showing an ounce of fear			2
" i have known @entity8 for over 11 years now and never met someone with such self belief , " @entity128 told @entity0			2
" he has a driving ambition to chase his dreams and able to catch them			0
he is a great example to all of us			0
" @entity8 will now turn his attention to breaking the blind water speed record and become the first man to hold all three records at the same time			1
former soldier @entity140 currently holds the record of 91mph but @entity8 is confident he can surpass that achievement when he hits the water at @entity145 , @entity146 , on @entity13 's south west coast			1
@entity8 will be assisted by @entity148 , who owns the race boat @entity149 and will offer navigational assistance through helmet to helmet radio communication			2
the team believes he can reach 95mph if conditions allow -- a result which would see him become the first man to hold the land , air and sea record in the same year			1
" it would be amazing if we could do it , " added @entity8			2
" it 's really exciting and i can not wait for it to happen			0
