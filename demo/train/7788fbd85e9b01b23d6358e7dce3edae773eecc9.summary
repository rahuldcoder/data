@entity0 -- @entity3 prime minister @entity2 met in president @entity4 what might be a new chapter in the 60 - year relationship between @entity3 and the @entity8			1
@entity3 prime minister @entity2 and president @entity4 visit at the @entity9 on monday			2
based on interviews with @entity8 , @entity3 and @entity13 diplomats , no one expects a drastic change in the relationship -- the @entity4 administration wo n't waiver from the traditional unshakable commitment to @entity3 's security			1
but the @entity4 administration seems to have a different view from @entity3 -- and previous @entity8 administrations -- on how that security is best achieved			1
observers think this administration -- @entity4 , national security adviser gen. @entity25 and @entity27 envoy @entity26 in particular -- are predisposed to be tougher on @entity3 than the @entity29 administration was			1
@entity3 are concerned the special strategic relationship between the @entity8 and @entity3 could be in jeopardy			2
because @entity4 has made clear he thinks a @entity34 state better serves @entity3 's and the @entity8 ' security , there were expectations of a showdown between him and @entity2			1
@entity2 came to @entity0 refusing to commit to a two - state solution and instead talked of a " @entity34 entity " with promises of beefed - up economic development			0
arab states and the @entity8 have said that 's not a substitute for a true @entity34 state			2
because of the good will and enhanced credibility the election of @entity4 has brought the @entity8 around the world , he can ask for more , and expect more , on this issue			2
the @entity8 is working with @entity53 's @entity52 to " sequence " the @entity13 initiative , a plan proposed by then - @entity52 in 2003 and endorsed by the @entity57			0
under the plan , all @entity13 states would normalize relations with @entity3 after it returns former @entity34 , @entity62 and @entity63 territories			0
the @entity8 wants @entity3 and the @entity13 countries to take simultaneous steps toward peace			0
for instance , if @entity3 halts settlement activity or removes outposts , the @entity13 could take any number of steps , such as opening trade offices in @entity3 or allowing telecommunications or air travel between @entity3 and @entity13 countries			0
there is a long list of potential moves and different @entity13 countries are considering steps from the list			0
some are more willing to participate than others			0
we will probably hear more about this in the coming weeks as @entity87 president @entity86 and @entity89 president @entity88 visit @entity0 later this month			0
@entity2 has also made clear one of his main priorities is dealing with the threat posed by @entity93 's nuclear program ; he 's said that if the @entity8 ca n't eliminate the threat through talking , @entity3 will do so militarily			1
he also has threatened to halt progress on the @entity34 issue until the @entity8 takes meaningful steps to curb @entity93			1
the @entity8 has made clear that such threats are a nonstarter			0
@entity2 's position is to solve @entity93 first and then @entity3 can deal with @entity34 peace			1
the @entity8 wants the @entity3 to make peace with the @entity34 and it will deal with @entity93 at the same time			1
in fact , @entity0 believes progress on the @entity34 issue could rally @entity13 support for dealing with @entity93			2
@entity3 diplomats said @entity2 is not going to provoke a confrontation with @entity4 and they expected him to announce some immediate steps to improve the quality of life for @entity34 in the @entity111 , including removing illegal settlement outposts			1
however , @entity2 made no such announcement during a brief photo opportunity with @entity4			0
@entity2 was expected to make a statement supporting the idea of a @entity34 state , but most analysts said he would stop short of a full endorsement			0
again , sitting next to @entity4 , @entity2 spoke of a scenario in which " @entity3 and the @entity34 live side by side in dignity , security and in peace , " but he did n't mention a @entity34 state			1
monday 's meeting was largely expected to be a chance for the two sides to discuss their positions rather than iron out differences			0
some might see this as @entity4 being tougher on @entity3 , but others say it 's an evenhandedness that has n't been seen from recent @entity8 administrations			1
in short , it seems the @entity4 administration is going to use more of a tough - love approach to @entity3 , rather than just automatically siding with it			2
@entity1 's @entity139 contributed to this report .			0

no one expects a drastic change in @entity8 - @entity3 relationship
but @entity4 has different approach from past administrations
observers think @entity4 team is predisposed to be tougher on @entity3
whether @entity34 or @entity93 get attention first is at issue
