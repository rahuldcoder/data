@entity1 's defense of his @entity4 crown is in doubt after the @entity6 requested friday that the @entity9 's @entity8 team has its @entity11 license withdrawn			1
five @entity8 riders from the @entity14 - based team have been caught doping since last august and as a result it had only been granted a provisional license for the 2015 season			0
the world governing body said in a statement that an audit of the team , carried out by the @entity24 at the @entity25 ( @entity26 ) , had given them " compelling grounds " to make its decision			1
" the @entity6 considers that the @entity26 audit has , among other things , revealed a big difference between the policies and structures that the team presented to the @entity36 in december and the reality on the ground , " it said			0
@entity8 has also been caught up in the @entity40 investigation by @entity9 police into links between professional cyclists and banned doctor @entity44 , who was @entity45 's personal trainer			2
the @entity6 revealed friday that some of the evidence it had been provided with by the @entity9 authorities " concerns @entity8 members " and this will also be passed on to its @entity52 , which is an independent four - man body , headed by a @entity55 judge			2
@entity8 has still to make a formal response to the @entity6 decision , but if it is stripped of its license to race at the highest level of professional cycling it would be a serious blow to @entity63 and other star riders like @entity9 @entity65			0
a @entity11 license gives an automatic passport to the top races in cycling like the @entity4 , the @entity70 and the @entity71 , plus one - day classics such as @entity73 and @entity74			2
@entity1 -- who has never failed a drugs test -- would be forced to switch to another team if he wants to compete , assuming his current contract with @entity8 has a get out clause			0
the 30 - year - old @entity1 captured the coveted yellow jersey of the @entity4 last july -- succeeding @entity81 's @entity80 , who crashed out in the early stages of the 2014 edition			0
@entity8 , the team self - confessed drugs cheat @entity45 chose to ride for in his 2009 comeback , has a controversial past and is headed by @entity88 , who served a two - year ban after being caught doping at the 2007 @entity4			1
the latest scandals involved brothers @entity91 and @entity93 , who were caught using the blood - booster ( @entity94 ) , while three riders from its development squad also failed drugs tests			0
it led to widespread calls for the @entity6 , under the new leadership of @entity103 @entity102 , to take firm action and @entity8 was only granted its temporary license under condition that its management and anti-doping policies would face further scrutiny			1
back in 2012 , the @entity6 stripped @entity110 of its @entity11 license , but the @entity113 - based team successfully appealed to the @entity114 in @entity115 to be reinstated .			1
