@entity0 -- when the @entity2 retreated from a standoff with @entity4 , a few hundred people traveled to his @entity7 ranch to protest what they see as an overreach of the federal government			1
one protester from neighboring @entity12 , @entity13 , 45 , called the @entity2 's actions " tyranny in government			2
" and a banner at the protest site blared : " has the @entity19 been won ? @entity20 has the fight just begun ! " showdown on the range the @entity4 standoff is emblematic of the larger anti-government sentiment around the country that has been amplified with the creation of the tea party movement in 2009			1
but the latest move in a two - decade - long tug of war between @entity4 and the federal government is bringing to light the delicate balance that has lasted between citizens in the @entity19 and the federal government over the use of federally owned land for generations			1
private rancher on public lands ? @entity4 tends his 900 cattle grazing on taxpayer - owned land about 100 miles north of @entity40			1
to an @entity43 dweller , the concept of public lands can be a foreign one , as people own or rent their plot of space in urban , suburban and commuter towns that crowd the @entity43			1
but out west , public lands are a big deal			1
almost everyone uses them or depends on them			0
they are key to people 's recreational hiking , fishing , hunting and skiing			1
and they are critical to people 's livelihood , as they are used to cut timber , drill oil , mine coal and ranch cattle			1
vast swaths of the land in the @entity19 are predominately public			2
in @entity7 , for example , 87 % of the state is owned by the federal government , and the @entity2 oversees 245 million acres of public lands mostly west of the @entity72 , not including the lands overseen by the @entity74 and half a dozen other federal agencies			1
" public lands are true assets of the @entity78 , " said @entity76 , former director of the @entity2			1
@entity79 calls @entity4 , supporters ' domestic terrorists ' how did @entity4 ever get use of federal lands ? in @entity7 , ranchers depend on the federal lands for their livelihood			1
the government began allowing the use of the land in 1877 to promote the economic development of dry , difficult - to - cultivate desert areas			0
so it offered land for dirt cheap			0
@entity4 says his family has owned the ranch since about the time the @entity97 passed			2
a version of the law still exists today , allowing ranchers to graze their cattle on public lands for a nominal rate			1
the fee is cheaper than what the rancher would pay the state or a private land owner , but the tradeoff is that the rancher has to share the land with the public			2
feds end roundup , release cattle after showdown the history this is not the first standoff between public land users and the government			2
the most famous one , the @entity123 in the 1970s , pitted ranchers , loggers and miners against the federal government			1
they thought the @entity129 administration was too heavy - handed in its regulatory and environmental policies			0
former @entity7 state sen. @entity132 , who is also a rancher , led the negotiations with the federal government , which he said were peaceful and productive			1
@entity134 , @entity129 's opponent in the 1980 presidential election , sided with the sagebrush rebels , saying , " the next administration wo n't treat the @entity19 as if it were not worthy of attention			2
the next administration will reflect the values and goals of the @entity123			0
indeed , we can turn the @entity123 into the @entity142			0
" @entity134 was a former governor of @entity143 , where the federal government owns roughly half the state 's land since then , the @entity2 and the corresponding state agency have confiscated cattle from violators , but nothing escalated to the temperature of the @entity4 situation			1
the @entity2 the @entity2 is a federal agency that operates predominantly in the @entity19 and is in charge of managing these lands			1
it must balance the desires of ranchers , environmentalists , recreationalists , and industrialists			0
" i think a lot of people who live in the @entity43 do n't understand the @entity2 , " said @entity160 , the former director			0
@entity163 is manager of the 200,000 - acre @entity164 in @entity165 , @entity7 , a third of which uses public lands			1
he says he 's sympathetic to the @entity2 , citing its difficult job			0
" a lot of times they do n't make anybody happy , " he said , because the bureau is responsible for managing lands for so many uses			0
" i think that folks on the ground at @entity2 are good folks trying to do the best they can			0
" but this system unique to the @entity78 brings conflict			0
the environmentalists the balance between conservation and public use is a major source of tension when overseeing government land			2
the desert tortoise is a factor in the @entity4 equation , and the rancher was ordered to remove his cattle from public lands in 1993 after the tortoise was placed on the protected species list			1
@entity4 refused to comply , and he racked up more than $ 1 million in fines			2
@entity196 , executive director at the @entity197 , called @entity4 " one of the most selfish and irresponsible users of public land that i 've ever witnessed			2
" " the key tenet in public lands in @entity78 is they belong to all of us , " he said			1
when one person puts his " own selfish interest above everyone else 's , the whole system falls apart			0
" ranchers ' sentiment the @entity4 situation is a common topic of conversation in rural @entity7 , a part of the country filled with libertarian sentiment distrustful of the government , @entity163 said			1
and like his , he said people 's feelings are mixed			1
while the ranch manager is sympathetic to the @entity2 's mission , he said its tactics were the wrong approach			0
@entity163 said he understands where @entity4 is coming from , saying the @entity2 " put his back up against the wall			2
" but @entity163 also said that @entity4 lost all efforts at appeal and that now he should follow the law			2
" i think it 's a mess any way you slice it , " he said			0
' welfare ranchers ' because of the cheap rent , some , including fellow cattlemen who do n't ranch on public lands , call public land ranchers " welfare ranchers " and have no sympathy for the @entity247 lot			1
but @entity163 said they do n't understand that ranching public land is " not a bargain			0
" " on public lands , you might get kicked off at any moment for a turtle			2
that 's kind of the deal , " he said			0
@entity132 , the former @entity7 state senator , said 600 ranchers are currently paying their fees to the federal government for use of the land			1
he says that because of @entity4 , people will " think that us in @entity7 are getting away with not paying the government what it owes them			1
" the politics unsurprisingly , @entity4 has become a political symbol			0
@entity79 , @entity269 , called him a " domestic terrorist			0
" " these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not , " he said in @entity40			0
@entity274 rep. @entity273 told journalist @entity275 that @entity4 is " not a folk hero , " @entity275 tweeted , but said @entity79 should n't call him a terrorist			0
but libertarian - minded sen. @entity278 of @entity279 criticized the federal government 's response , saying it " should n't violate the law , nor should we have 48 federal agencies carrying weapons and having @entity287 teams			1
" " can everybody decide what the law is on their own ? no , there has to be a legal process , " he said on @entity294 in @entity295			0
" but i think there is definitely a philosophic debate over who should own the land			0
" the future the @entity2 might have lost the latest battle with @entity4 , but it has other tools at its disposal , including arresting @entity4 for failing to follow the law , seizing his assets through the @entity308 or sending the case to the @entity310			0
the agency has not yet said what its next course of action will be , but former @entity2 director @entity160 said that it must prevail because of the precedent it would set			0
if @entity4 gets away with illegally grazing on lands and not paying fines , it could encourage other ranchers to follow suit			2
while @entity4 is a source of contention , ranchers out @entity19 are watching the @entity2 's next steps in the @entity324 standoff , and they are worried about the @entity2 's next major action : conservationists are asking for protection for the sage grouse			1
the @entity330 says the @entity2 's draft proposal includes " overly burdensome grazing requirements			0
" it would also reduce the number of grazing permits .			0

@entity4 supporters say the federal government is *trampling* on its *rights*
but not all ranchers in @entity7 support rancher @entity4
the use of public lands out @entity19 is critical to people 's livelihood
