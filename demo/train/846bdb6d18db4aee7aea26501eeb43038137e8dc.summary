lawmakers began a new session of @entity2 with the mass shooting at @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , still fresh in their minds -- inspiring a new push to pass gun laws that could prevent another tragedy			1
on @entity13 , lawmakers in the @entity12 introduced nearly a dozen bills related to gun violence			1
rep. @entity16 , @entity18 - @entity17 , a longtime gun control advocate , led the fight on the @entity22 side of the aisle			1
she 's sponsoring legislation that would require background checks for all gun sales -- including at gun shows -- and ban online sales of ammunition			1
@entity16 is also co-sponsoring a bill to ban high - capacity magazines with rep. @entity32 , @entity33			2
@entity32 's district includes @entity35 , where two gunmen killed 13 people in 1999 , and is next to @entity38 , where a gunman killed 12 people in a mass shooting at a movie theater in july			0
" these assault magazines help put the ' mass ' in ' mass shooting ' and anything we can do to stop their proliferation will save lives in @entity55 , " said @entity16 , whose husband was killed and her son critically wounded in a mass shooting on the @entity46 in @entity17 in 1993			0
" these devices are used to kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time possible , and we owe it to innocent @entity55 everywhere to keep them out of the hands of dangerous people			0
" meanwhile , two @entity65 freshmen , rep. @entity66 of @entity67 and rep. @entity68 of @entity69 , have introduced bills that would allow more guns around schools			1
in the @entity75 , @entity74 democrat @entity73 plans to introduce a bill to ban the sale , transfer , importation and manufacturing of more than 100 firearms			2
the bill would also ban certain semiautomatic rifles , handguns and shotguns that can accept a detachable magazine , and semiautomatic rifles and handguns with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds			0
the assault weapons ban @entity73 helped pass in 1994 expired in 2004			0
@entity73 is in the process of gathering support for her bill in both chambers			2
marine to @entity73 : ' no ma'am , ' i wo n't register my guns bills sponsored by sen. @entity99 , @entity100 , to ban high - capacity magazines and sen. @entity102 , @entity18 - @entity17 , to enhance background checks and close the gun show loophole already have counterparts in the lower chamber			1
but gun control is a heated topic , and any push to restrict access to guns will be met with strong opposition from the 4 - million - member @entity113 , the nation 's most powerful gun rights lobby			1
the @entity113 has long blocked efforts to introduce tougher gun laws , arguing @entity2 can not infringe on the @entity120 right to bear arms			1
in a press conference a week after the @entity5 shootings , the group 's executive vice president @entity122 asked , " since when did the word ' gun ' automatically become a bad word ? " he called on @entity2 to appropriate enough money to put armed police officers in every school in the country			2
the @entity113 has also questioned the effectiveness of gun bans , suggesting they could put communities in danger			2
" politicians pass laws for @entity140 , " @entity122 said during the december press conference			2
" they issue press releases bragging about them			0
they post signs advertising them			0
and in so doing , they tell every insane killer in @entity55 that schools are their safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk			0
" gun owners fear new legislation could tread on their rights no gun - control efforts will bear fruit without support from both sides of the aisle , which is by no means a sure thing			1
so far , no @entity65 have come forward to sponsor new legislation restricting gun rights , and several @entity22 also speak out in favor of gun rights			1
" the @entity113 is the big issue , but i would n't say it 's on the @entity65 side only , it 's on the @entity22 side also			2
... fully half of your new @entity75 has either an @entity171 , a or a- rating from the @entity113 , " said @entity166 , who covers gun control for @entity168			2
" the @entity113 has said that the answer to @entity5 is to put more guns , more police officers in schools , and so if you want anything to happen on gun control , you 're going to have at least half of the @entity75 upsetting the @entity113 and that 's a very difficult proposition			1
" @entity166 said some elements of gun control -- like banning high - capacity ammunition magazines -- could get passed , but more comprehensive legislation faces long odds			1
gun - control supporters believe having the support of the highest office in the land could help make a difference this time around			1
president @entity189 called for action at a vigil in @entity5 after the shooting			0
" since i 've been president , this is the fourth time we have come together to comfort a grieving community torn apart by mass shootings , fourth time we 've hugged survivors , the fourth time we 've consoled the families of victims , " he said			0
" are we really prepared to say that we 're powerless in the face of such carnage , that the politics are too hard ? " days later , he announced vice president @entity203 would lead a task force to come up with recommendations on ways to reduce gun violence , which is expected to include new gun regulations			1
those recommendations are due this month , and the president has said he wants @entity2 to pass legislation this year			0
@entity211 : why would someone own a military - style rifle ? while the politics will be difficult , pro-gun control members believe the 113th @entity2 could make progress on guns			1
" we 're hopeful that more can get done on this issue now than in many years , " said @entity218 , @entity16 's communications director			0
" the climate seems different now , after @entity5 , than after other recent mass shootings			0
" they also acknowledge a tough and potentially long road ahead			0
" there is no more uphill fight than this , the question is do we fight or do we knuckle under and we 're not knuckle - unders			0
we 're just not going to knuckle under			0
it may take a year it may take two it may take three , " @entity73 said in december			0
analysis : guns and the law it 's also a fight that will have to compete with several other legislative priorities , including the debate over raising the country 's borrowing limit , and a deficit - cutting agreement that will avoid steep automatic spending cuts that are set to kick in about two months from now if lawmakers ca n't make a deal			1
" there 's definitely a question of timing and floor time for these kinds of debates , and then there 's also the political question , " said @entity166			0
" you just had a fiscal cliff deal where the @entity12 speaker really alienated a lot of the members of his own party , because he was seen as making too many concessions towards the @entity22 , and if you 're talking about an issue as powerful and emotional as gun control , is the speaker really going to meet @entity22 halfway on something like that and risk offending his own party even more ? i think that 's a really important question			1

lawmakers in @entity12 introduce *multiple* bills related to gun violence
gun - control advocates sponsor bills requiring background checks for all gun sales
two @entity65 freshmen introduce bills to allow more guns around schools
fate of proposed laws depends on getting support from both sides of aisle
