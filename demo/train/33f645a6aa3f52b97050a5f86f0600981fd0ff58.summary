-- this month , if everything goes according to schedule , your @entity1 may begin monitoring your account , just to make sure you are n't doing anything wrong with it -- like sharing copyrighted movie or music files			1
while we might all agree that copyright holders need to be protected , we may not all be equally happy about all of our communications being checked for violations			0
people and businesses who are not doing anything illegal may still have some things they wish to hide from their internet access providers			2
under normal circumstances , your internet service provider , or @entity1 , tries to protect you and your data from spying eyes			1
@entity25 , @entity26 ( an independent company no longer directly affiliated with @entity27 , the parent of @entity0 and this site ) and @entity30 utilize all sorts of software to keep the connections between our modems and their servers safe			0
they also encourage us to keep our home networks secure from eavesdroppers			0
but what are we supposed to do when the eavesdropper is the @entity1 itself ? this is the most disturbing question raised by a new alliance among @entity44 's biggest isps and media giants such as @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , which is to go into effect this month			1
the effort , dubbed the @entity51 , hopes to combat the illegal downloading and sharing of movies and music by monitoring it at the source - your computer			2
until now , it was up to movie and music companies to figure out when their stuff was being illegally shared			0
this was a little tricky , because files are n't stored on just one user 's computer			2
hundreds or thousands of sharers have bits and pieces of stolen files , for downloaders to reassemble into songs or movies			0
so movie companies have been searching online for copies of their own movies , identifying the locations of everyone from whom they received a bit of data			2
then they contact the internet service providers , who send letters of warning to subscribers ' homes			1
a number of clever workarounds , including certain kinds of encryption or the use of " proxy " servers in other countries , have helped advanced users of file - sharing software stay one step ahead of the movie companies			0
if a file sharer appears to be working out of @entity104 , say , the movie studio ca n't rely on a friendly @entity1 to find an illegal downloader here in the @entity44			1
as i understand the new agreement and subsequent comments , which are about as cryptic as a copy - protected dvd , @entity1 's have agreed to implement a standardized " graduated response plan " through which offending users are warned , restricted and eventually cut off from the internet for successive violations			1
the companies are supposed to be developing systems that keep track of all this , so that the letters and usage restrictions happen automatically			2
the fact that they are all agreeing to participate makes it harder for any one company to win the disgruntled customers of those who have been disciplined by another			0
but now that they 're free from individual blame , there 's also the strong possibility that the @entity1 will be doing the data monitoring directly			1
that 's a much bigger deal			2
so instead of reaching out to the @entity114 to track down illegally flowing bits of their movies , the studios will sit back while @entity1 's " sniff " the packets of data coming to and from their customers ' computers			1
while they 're simply claiming to be protecting copyright holders , @entity1 have a lot to gain from all this as well			1
for instance , in many cases the internet subscriber might have no knowledge of the infraction that the @entity1 detects			1
a houseguest might log onto one 's home network simply to check e-mail			0
because his sharing software might be running in the background ( even when he 's not downloading files himself ) he is in effect sharing his own movie files wherever he goes			0
your @entity1 sniffs the packets , so you are nabbed			1
the same is true for those of us who run " open networks " so that neighbors and others nearby can get free internet access when they need it			0
( in the old days , that used to be considered polite			0
) once sharing a network connection becomes a legal liability , our already privatized access channels will become less a community resource			0
and the @entity1 's will have the pleasure of selling individual subscriptions to neighbors who used to share			1
worse , subscribers will be losing their expectation of privacy from their own service providers			1
while most of us are n't too worried about someone at an internet provider seeing our messages to @entity185 , businesses , law firms or hospitals who use the @entity114 to communicate privileged information might have more reservations			0
if monitoring of data streams becomes de rigueur , what 's to stop an @entity1 ( or a particularly unscrupulous or bribable employee ) from monitoring its competitors ' communications ? admittedly , such scenarios are only as outlandish as the possibility that @entity201 newspapers could successfully bribe @entity202			1
as internet security expert @entity203 explained to me , " honestly , the prohibition made more sense than this			0
" to protect his own data , he already uses servers outside the @entity44 , and fears other companies may soon feel the need to do the same : " the risk of losing their ' net [ access ] because someone accidentally streamed the wrong thing is a business prerogative significant enough to tunnel all their traffic to a country that provides sensible data privacy laws			1
how much long after that until the rest of the company gets off - shored ? " whether the agreement promises to unleash such demons has yet to be seen			0
for the time being , though , the practice of preventing abuse by restricting peer - to - peer activity appears doomed only to escalate the arms race between consumers and their producers			0
the longer term solution would be to develop an appropriate social contract : conducting ourselves online under the same civilized behavioral norms that keep us from , say , stealing stuff from one another 's homes even though we could probably get away with it			2
it 's not really that hard , and it 's worth figuring out before the privilege of free interaction is taken away from us - along with any expectation of privacy			1
only by strengthening people 's ability to distinguish between sharing and stealing will we be able to build a society capable of surviving our networks			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity259 .			2

@entity259 : your @entity1 may soon begin monitoring your account
he says new alliance of @entity48 , @entity46 , @entity47 , big @entity1 to detect , stop online *piracy*
he says new plan lets @entity1 's keep track of , *punish* offenders , but could take in the innocent
@entity259 : subscribers will be losing expectation of privacy from their own service providers
