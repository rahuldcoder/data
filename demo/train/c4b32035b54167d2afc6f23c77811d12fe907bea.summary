@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 coal - mining company is cleaning up its act by building cheap , eco-friendly housing using its industrial waste			1
for some years @entity7 -- one of the world 's largest mining firms -- has been purifying the water contaminated during its coal mining activities in the @entity1 city of @entity0			1
now , @entity7 is mixing the waste by - product -- a mineral known as gypsum -- with cement to make energy - efficient bricks it uses to build houses there			1
" we 've built 62 houses so far , " said @entity23 , @entity7 's head of sustainable development , and the driving force behind the initiative			1
" each home requires about eight tons of gypsum , but at present we 're removing over 200 tons of it from the water every day			1
" gypsum is a basic mineral compound of calcium and sulphur			1
the non-toxic mineral is soluble in water , but becomes harder and more adhesive the hotter and dryer it gets			1
because gypsum is malleable when wet , its most common commercial application to date is as the main ingredient for household plaster			0
" actually , there are 50 different uses for it -- from dental surgery to fireproofing doors , " said @entity23			0
" but there is a serious housing shortfall here , and we have so much gypsum , that once we decided we needed to do something with it , making a strong building material was the obvious choice			2
" and @entity23 believes that his new bricks have significant advantages over the heavy cement ones typically used in the area : " the bricks are generally harder than traditional cement bricks , they 're also better heat and sound insulators , " he said			2
but , most crucially for one of the fastest growing urban areas in @entity1 , the gypsum bricks have a lower environmental impact			2
" because it ( gypsum ) is such a strong binding agent , we need much less cement to make ( the bricks ) , " said @entity23			1
according to figures from the @entity78 , about 5 % of all the world 's man - made @entity80 emissions stem from the chemical and combustion processes involved in cement production			1
most types of cement are made by heating limestone , a chemical process known as calcination which releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere			0
the industrial manufacture of cement also requires large quantities of fuel			0
@entity23 claims that his low - cement bricks save , on average , three tonnes of carbon dioxide for every home built			1

" this is my first house ... this is my dream house , and i 'm happy			0
i feel free with my family , " enthused @entity114 , whose husband works at one of @entity7 's coal mines in @entity0			0
the @entity114 family was among the first to move into a gypsum - brick house after the company started building accommodation for its workers in 2010			2
but can gypsum -- a product that @entity7 had been discarding as waste before last year -- really be such a wonder material ? @entity126 is head of minerals at the @entity128			2
he says that gypsum , " a relatively common mineral geologically , " is indeed a great heat insulator and can be very strong -- but only as long as it stays dry			2
" i 've never heard of it being used to make bricks because it 's water soluble -- that 's why it 's so good as a plaster agent , " said @entity126			1
" i 'd be interested to know how they 've managed to get around that			0
" @entity23 says that because the bricks are still partially composed of cement , they are fully water resistant			1
" the brick mixture has been subjected to the most rigorous trials by the @entity146 , and passed without any problems , " he added			0
global carbon emissions from coal are second only to oil , according to the @entity151 , while other environmental factors such as air - pollution from coal dust and damage caused by mining also remain a serious problem			0
@entity23 acknowledges these issues , but says that coexistence between energy sources is necessary " for as long as the world is so much set up around running on coal			0
" while we 're still using it , the question is : what can we do to make it cleaner and even more useful ? i think our approach goes some way to achieving that goal			0
