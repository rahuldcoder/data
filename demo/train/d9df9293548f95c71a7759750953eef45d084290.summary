@entity0 , @entity1 -- six o'clock on a sunday morning and i 'm dragging myself out of bed to drive to @entity0 , @entity1 , of all places			1
i grab my camera gear and overnight bag packed with extra underwear , then sneak out of my @entity10 - area home for a day that promises to push my adrenaline to new levels			0
two - and - a - half hours later , i pull into an ordinary - looking @entity1 neighborhood			1
weird , there 's a roundabout in the middle of this residential street ? wait , that 's it ! the house with five cars in front , many of which have tornado logos emblazoned on the side			1
the doorbell button is busted , so i knock			0
almost immediately , @entity28 , one of the stars of the @entity31 's " @entity32 " series , welcomes me into his home			1
without going into too much gory detail , let 's just say there 's no doubt this place is a dude 's hangout			1
we talk about where we 'll head today to try to catch a tornado up close			1
he introduces me to @entity46 , their yorkie			0
@entity49 and @entity50 , two chasers i 've never met but will know much better by the end of our adventure , arrive with @entity56 's breakfast			1
a few more chasers join us , and the conversation turns to whether we should pack for an overnight chase			0
gizmo races through the doggie door to the backyard where the six of us gather to toss a @entity66 football and watch low - level clouds stream by in the @entity1 gusts			1
those clouds are a sign that moisture is streaming in , which is good for tornado formation			1
minutes later , we reach a collective decision to pack for an overnighter			0
suddenly , as if we 're a team of firefighters , everyone grabs their gear and piles into two chase vehicles			0
i jump into the back seat of a @entity83 land - yacht			0
@entity50 is driving , with @entity28 riding shotgun			1
@entity49 's in the back seat behind @entity50			1
and @entity86 , @entity49 's giant schnauzer , claims the middle seat between us			1
@entity86 apparently loves tornadoes , and she clocked 20,000 miles chasing with @entity49 last year			0
departure time : about 10:30 a.m. our target : @entity93 , @entity94			1
expected tornado : 6:00 p.m. damn ! how do they know when and where a tornado will strike ? they toss around various names of computer weather models and " z " times as they each make their case for when and where to go			1
it 's all foreign to me			2
i just hope they 're right			0
see inside a @entity110 about an hour up the road , @entity49 introduces me to his homemade energy drink			0
it 's a concoction of vegetables and @entity116 sauce that he bottles and freezes for the trip			2
@entity28 is pumped when he sees the cranberry colored juice			1
@entity28 takes a drink , and @entity49 hands the bottle to me			1
as a new dad with a son in day care , i immediately think about catching a cold from the shared bottle			0
then i remember i 'm on this trip to catch a tornado			2
if we screw this up , a cold will be the least of my worries			0
so , i take a swig			0
hot vegetables ! why did n't i bring a bottle of water ? after butt - numbing hours of driving , we eventually end up at a @entity141 in @entity142 , @entity94 , about an hour southeast of @entity93			1
it 's nearing 5:00 p.m. , but so far , there 's nothing showing on radar			1
will today be a bust ? we 'll know in another hour or two			0
after grabbing dinner , talk turns toward @entity150 , where storms have fired up			0
should we go there ? this is often the dilemma storm chasers face			0
while we 're waiting for something to happen , a tv crew from nearby @entity156 grabs @entity28 for a quick interview			1
minutes later , a girl who 's studying meteorology in high school stops by to talk with @entity28 about the jet stream and how she wants to chase storms			1
soon afterward , a woman drives up and asks if she should be worried that we 're in her town			0
finally , the latest radar data come in , and the team spots a storm about an hour north that looks promising			2
like a scene from the movie " twister , " we quickly dispense with the chit chat , load the dog into the backseat and race towards the developing storm near @entity177 , @entity94			1
the adrenaline begins to build as @entity28 , @entity50 and @entity49 excitedly examine the radar loop and point to the sky towards the left edge of the storm clouds			1
they do n't look ominous at first			0
but , as we drive further into the storm , the clouds take on a decidedly serious color			2
winds sweep up dust devils as we pass farms along the two - lane highway			2
we stop at three different locations under the rotating heart of the storm , hoping that a funnel will descend			0
cameras are rolling as winds gust and hail begins to fall			0
but , there 's no funnel			2
we jump back into the car and head east , trying to stay in front of this beast that 's moving at 50 mph			1
through the rear window , @entity49 spots what looks like a " gustnado			2
" wind gusts from a storm sometimes spin and create what looks like a small tornado , but a gustnado is n't directly connected to any rotation above			1
we pull over to the side of the road as the dust cloud behind us builds			1
" uh , it 's coming right for us " i utter calmly , as it grows larger and closer			2
like a @entity220 pro , @entity50 loops the car around to the opposite side of the highway			0
we grab our cameras and spring into action to film this amazing event			0
it soon becomes clear this is n't a gustnado , but an actual tornado			1
share your stories , photos and videos of severe weather about 50 yards from where we 're standing , this monster cloud of dust begins to tighten as it spins			1
you can see a tube of dust reaching into the sky			2
it moves almost gracefully through a field as we look on in awe			0
we ca n't feel any wind at first			0
then , suddenly in a deafening roar , strong winds begin to push us from behind like a crowd at a ball game			0
it 's as if the tornado is taking a huge breath while it sucks in the air it needs to survive			1
after the tornado passes , we pile into the car and race to get ahead			1
as we continue our pursuit , we see leaves , grass and other small debris floating through the air			1
we drive a few miles only realize the tornado has vanished			1
after hours of driving hundreds of miles , this incredible display of nature 's violent side is over in a matter of seconds			2
still , the trip is a huge success			0
that single storm was the only storm in the @entity274 that produced a tornado that day , and we were in exactly the right spot to see it			2
the tornado touched down only a few miles from our target location of @entity93 within an hour of our target time			2
while meteorologists ca n't predict with any certainty when or where a tornado is going to form , this chase showed that they are definitely making progress			2
after our euphoria and adrenaline subside , we head towards nearby @entity156 , @entity288 , to watch the storm sweep through			0
just as the lightning intensifies and the winds begin to gust , 2 - inch hail stones began to fall			0
@entity86 may love tornadoes , but she 's no fan of hail			2
she begins barking fiercely as @entity28 , @entity50 and i try to film the hail in the headlights			1
fortunately , there are no injuries or serious damage to our team			0
we wrap up our chase with a late night visit to @entity305 's for dinner			2
when the new weather models show a lower probability of tornadoes the next day , we decide to head back to @entity0			0
during the late night drive , i work in the backseat to edit the incredible video			0
eventually , the long day catches up to @entity50 , @entity86 and me			0
as i drift off to sleep , @entity50 crashes in the backseat , while @entity86 sleeps with her head in my lap. my first chase is already filling my mind with dreams of the power of nature in @entity323 .			0

@entity2 's @entity325 chases tornado with @entity28 of " @entity32 "
they study radar and drive from @entity1 to @entity94
they race to stay ahead of what they think is a gustnado moving at 50 mph
monster cloud of dust becomes roaring tornado as it sends debris floating through the air
