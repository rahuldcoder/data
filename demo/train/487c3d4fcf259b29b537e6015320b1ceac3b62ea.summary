@entity0 -- when @entity3 decided to bury the nation 's nuclear waste in @entity6 , @entity7 , the federal government moved at the pace of a glacier			1
but when the political winds changed and the government decided to shut down the project , it acted with unusual speed , according to a report released tuesday			1
the @entity16 reduced its staff and transferred excess property in the blink of an eye , bureaucratically speaking			0
" several @entity16 officials told us that they had never seen such a large program with so much pressure to close down so quickly , " the @entity21 said in the report			2
the shutdown of the @entity6 project , in fact , moved with such haste that it could hinder efforts to resurrect the plan if so desired by the @entity32 or the courts , the @entity21 said			1
@entity6 -- 100 miles northwest of @entity34 , @entity7 -- was to be the solution to the nuclear waste problem : a final destination for the tons of hazardous nuclear waste accumulating at commercial reactors in 33 states			1
in 1987 , @entity3 directed the @entity16 to dispose of waste in the mountain beginning in 1998			2
but political opposition to the plan has been relentless , and the @entity16 was unable to meet the deadline			0
in 2008 , the @entity16 submitted a license application to the @entity32 seeking to construct a nuclear waste repository at @entity6 , with a goal of opening it in 2017 , a date later delayed until 2020			1
in march of 2009 , following the election of president @entity53 , the secretary of energy announced plans to terminate the @entity6 project and set up a blue - ribbon commission to study alternatives			1
the commission is scheduled to issue an interim report in july and a final report by january			2
the @entity16 's decision to terminate the @entity6 program " was made for policy reasons , not technical or safety reasons , " the @entity21 report says			1
@entity16 officials believe " there are better solutions that can achieve a broader national consensus to the nation 's spent fuel and nuclear waste storage needs than @entity6 , " the @entity21 said			1
the @entity21 said that while it is unclear whether the @entity32 or the courts will resurrect the project , the @entity16 " undertook an ambitious set of steps to dismantle " the program			2
starting in february 2010 , the @entity16 redirected funds to be used on closeout activities , setting a september 30 , 2010 , deadline that was largely met , the @entity21 said			0
according to the @entity16 general counsel , the september 30 deadline did not allow time for formal planning , although officials stated they believe necessary plan did occur			0
the @entity16 undertook " extensive efforts to preserve data related to its licensing efforts , as well as other scientific information relevant to the storage and disposal of high - level waste and spent nuclear fuel , " the @entity21 said			1
in contrast , efforts to retain project staff were " minimal , " the @entity21 said			2
the 180 federal staffers began leaving as soon as they found new jobs , placing increasing stress on the remaining staff to have an orderly shutdown			0
the @entity16 used expedited procedures to transfer a large volume of office furniture and equipment , declaring it " abandoned " and moving it to other agencies , arguing that it would cost $ 680 per day to store the equipment more routine procedures were used			0
" the loss of staff with experience at @entity6 could hinder the license review if the process is resumed , " the @entity21 said			1
" reconstituting this expertise and teamwork could be difficult should the licensing process be resumed			0
" in a letter to the @entity21 , the @entity16 said it " strongly disagrees " with many of the reports conclusions			0
concerning the shutdown , it said the department " was committed to closing down the @entity123 in a responsible manner , and it successfully did so			0
" it said the @entity21 was inaccurate in stating it did not follow federal policy and guidance for planning .			0

@entity6 , @entity7 , was to be the site of nuclear waste storage
the @entity53 administration terminated the project
a government report says the shutdown moved quickly
so quickly , the report says , it could hinder efforts if the project is ever resurrected
