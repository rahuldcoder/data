-- when i was just 3 months old , i was smuggled by my aunt into the @entity3			1
i was born in @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6			1
only three months separated me from being a @entity3 citizen			1
three small months that could have completely changed my life			2
growing up in a town near @entity11 , which is predominantly @entity12 , i always fit in			2
i never thought about race until i got to middle school			1
that 's the first time i remember being called " @entity16 " and " white boy " because of my light skin and green eyes			2
i knew my family was @entity21 , but part of me was embarrassed			1
my parents did n't speak @entity24 , so i avoided having conversations with them in front of my friends			1
i was " too cool " to be associated with being @entity12			2
i was lost in my culture			2
now i know this was the case with lots of my friends -- we were all searching to fit in			2
it 's in part because of the way the @entity3 culture has brought us up			1
there were two classes at my middle school : " americanized " @entity39 and " beaner " @entity39			2
if you were dark - skinned and did n't speak @entity24 well , you were called a " beaner " and a border - hopper			2
you would be seen as " uncool " or an " outsider			2
" in gym class , some of the better soccer players were called " beaners			1
" it was @entity39 being racist toward other @entity39			2
i was one of those people who wanted to be associated with the more " @entity3 " kids , so i always went along with it as i entered high school			1
i tried to be like my friends as much as possible			2
they were second - or third - generation @entity6 who spoke @entity24 at school and hung out with the white kids			1
i dressed like the @entity3 who wore skater shoes , baggy pants and @entity62 t - shirts			1
and even though i loved soccer , i thought it was too @entity21 , so i played football instead			1
sadly , distancing yourself from your home culture was considered the norm			2
i fully regret it and wish i never had a part in it			2
share your personal essays with @entity73 freshman year is when i first found out i was undocumented			1
i was waiting at registration and when the clerk was going through my paperwork , she asked if i knew my social security number			2
i told her i 'd get it from my mom later			0
when i got home , my parents had told me about my " story			1
" i remember feeling ashamed of myself , that i was one of them , a " beaner			0
" i mean how could someone like me , someone who looks white , be an undocumented immigrant ? i always thought undocumented immigrants were working the farms and not speaking @entity24			1
it 's bad to say , but that was my vision of what an undocumented immigrant was			1
i always felt like i was too good to be an undocumented immigrant			1
i got good grades in high school			0
i was your typical @entity3 kid			1
i could n't help but wonder : why is that one piece of paper stopping me from saying i 'm an @entity3 ? from that point on , my life changed			1
i realized that i would not be getting my driver 's license at 16			0
i would not be getting a summer job to make money			0
throughout high school , i was always careful about what i said in my circle of friends			0
when my friends would talk about going on vacations to other countries , i would feel so left out			0
i hated hearing them because it would bring me down			0
i wished that i had been born here			1
i wish i had been a @entity3 citizen			1
but you can either dwell on it or deal with it			0
at 17 , i got my first job working at a video store			0
it helped me feel more " normal " and more " @entity3 , " even though i still could n't legally drive			1
after i graduated , i started driving without a license			0
i had no choice ; i had to get to work and school			0
when most people my age were excited to drive , i felt the opposite			0
every time i was behind the wheel , i had a constant fear of being pulled over			0
yes there was some excitement , but that quickly faded when i realized the risks i ran			0
being pulled over meant a ticket , my car being towed , and money to fix it all			0
when i was 21 , i got into a minor accident where i made a small dent on an older man 's car			0
when i pulled over , i just remember wanting to disappear or die			0
my heart sank and i was scared out of my mind			0
i called my dad , who came over quickly with my uncle			0
as i waited , the man insulted me			0
when he learned i had no license he flipped , cursing me and calling me every name in the book			1
after that accident i was even more cautious when i drove			0
@entity157 : undocumented and hiding in plain sight in my early 20s , i stopped caring about who knew i was undocumented			1
it 's not like something i chose			0
it 's not like it made me un-american			0
i told three of my closest friends about it and they could not believe what i was telling them			0
they could n't believe that someone like me , who looks so white , could be an undocumented immigrant			1
now i 'm 25 , and i have learned a lot			2
i come from a beautiful culture of people who are full of tradition and i am proud of it			0
to this day , i 'm still asked what ethnicity i am			0
when i tell them i 'm @entity21 , they just look at me in confusion and ask if i speak @entity177			1
when i respond in @entity177 , the look on their faces is just priceless			1
after president @entity181 signed an executive order in 2012 allowing children who had entered the country illegally to remain and work , i applied for relief from deportation			0
it took a couple of months , but in december 2012 , i got the good news			0
i could n't help but think about all of the possibilities that could come , like getting a good job and a driver 's license			0
i still wish i had a way to travel outside of the @entity3			1
i know the first place i would visit : i 'd go to @entity6			1
opinion : the undocumented are us if you 've immigrated to the @entity3 , we want to hear your story			1
what was your path to citizenship or residency like ? share a personal essay about your experiences with @entity73 .			0
