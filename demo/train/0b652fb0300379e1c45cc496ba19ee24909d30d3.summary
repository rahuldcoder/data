-- conventional webmaster wisdom holds that changing the name of a website leads to a drop in its popularity			1
" you are going to lose traffic , " a @entity7 blogger warned would - be name changers in 2009			1
" that is a fact			2
even if you only perform a domain change and preserve the exact same site structure and content , you will lose some traffic			2
" if that 's true , it spells bad news for @entity19 , which on monday changed its name and url to @entity19 following a split from @entity23 , the technology giant that had partnered with the @entity25 news network to produce the website			1
but maybe that assumption is outdated ? @entity30 , for its part , said it does n't expect the move to affect traffic			2
all existing urls , including those linked on social media sites , will still work or will redirect to the new @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity39 chief digital officer , said in a conference call with reporters monday			1
( the @entity19 cable channel will launch a new website in 2013 as an extension of its on - air brand , @entity39 said			1
) if you take a look at a few of the sites that have changed their names -- it 's really rare for a site to do so , by the way -- you see that many of them not only survive a name change but are able to thrive after it			1
or maybe because of it			2
here 's a look at a few that have come out better on the other end of a @entity21 switch : @entity65 : if you 're under 30 , or if you saw " @entity67 , " you probably know that @entity65 used to be called thefacebook.com			1
the company officially dropped the " the " in august 2005			2
that 's universally regarded as a good move , but it 's worth pointing out that the switch occurred before @entity65 was a household name			1
@entity75 : the @entity75 , now super popular and owned by @entity76 , started in 1990 as a @entity78 group with the domain rec.arts.movies			0
the site then was hosted by @entity81 before it migrated to @entity75 , according to a feature in @entity83			0
@entity84 : the pop culture and gay news blog started out as @entity87 , a reference to the @entity90 's gossip column			0
now pretty much no one ( except a friend from @entity94 's website , who sent this reference ) remembers the previous blog			0
@entity98 : the internet retailer changed its name to @entity98 in 2011 , but switched it back , as @entity102 reports , because of brand confusion			1
consider this the warning for @entity19 , although @entity30 is already a recognizable brand in the @entity25			1
@entity98 , by the way , still redirects to @entity108 's site			0
@entity109 : @entity110 founded a site called @entity112 in 1999			0
the next year , it would merge with @entity114 to become @entity109 , the well - known online payment system			0
according to @entity109 's official blog , the " x " was a reference to that " universally recognized programming variable " -- a reference to innovation and creation			0
this may be the only example of a site 's url actually getting less cool because of a change			0
@entity127 : the micro-blogging site launched in 2006 as @entity127 because a " bird enthusiast " already owned the url for @entity127 , according to @entity129			0
six months later , the company had enough money to buy some vowels			0
@entity134 : remember that fashionable digital butler from the ' 90s ? @entity134 began in 1996 as @entity137 but fired jeeves in 2005 to become @entity134			0
can you think of any others ? do you have thoughts on the @entity19 name change ? if so , please let us know in the comments section .			1

@entity19 changes its name to @entity19
@entity36 changes are *incredibly* rare on the internet
still , there are examples of *successful* companies changing their web addresses
@entity65 , of course , used to be @entity65
