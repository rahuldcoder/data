@entity0 -- did the @entity2 make the right decision in reading the suspected underwear bomber his miranda rights and placing him in the civilian court system only hours after he was detained for trying to blow up a @entity9 flight on @entity10 ? that question has been at the heart of heated discussions on @entity14			1
this is what we know about the interrogations : fbi director @entity19 said suspect @entity20 was interviewed twice by what @entity19 called some of the best @entity2 agents			1
officials said the first interrogation lasted about 50 minutes , and the second was shorter			2
@entity20 provided information that " has already proved useful in the fight against @entity31 , " @entity28 spokesman @entity27 said			1
it was after the second interrogation that @entity20 was read his @entity35 rights -- rights under @entity37 law that are read to individuals before arrest			1
at that point , he stopped talking to the agents			0
though @entity19 acknowledged that he was not consulted about the decision , he said the @entity28 and others in the administration were contacted before the second interview			2
choices in how to proceed law enforcement officers did have choices in how to proceed with @entity20 : -- they could have read him his miranda rights , placing him in the civilian judicial system			1
-- he could have been designated an enemy combatant and held for a military trial			1
-- he could have been held and interrogated for a longer period before they decided how to proceed			2
at a series of congressional hearings on the handling of the @entity20 case , senior intelligence and @entity62 officials testified that they were not consulted on how the suspect should be handled			1
director of national intelligence @entity65 said a newly created high - value , detainee - interrogation group , or @entity69 , should have been brought into the loop			2
" that unit was created exactly for this purpose : to make a decision on whether a certain person who is detained should be treated as a case for federal prosecution or for some of the other means , " he said			2
however , @entity65 later discovered that @entity69 was not yet operational , a revelation that surprised many senators			0
some in @entity82 incredulous sen. @entity83 , @entity84 , called the decision to place @entity20 in the federal judicial system " a terrible , terrible mistake when it 's pretty clear that this individual did not act alone			1
" sen. @entity90 of @entity91 likened it to " a kind of ' @entity95 ' turning of the world of common sense on its head			0
" and @entity99 , who led the investigation into the 9/11 terrorist attacks , said he was " shocked and upset " that @entity20 received all his rights before being fully questioned			1
@entity2 director @entity19 defended his agents ' actions			1
" in this particular case , in fast - moving events , decisions were made , appropriately i believe , very appropriately , given the situation , " the director said			0
@entity19 added , " there was no time to get a follow - up group in there			0
" those comments prompted a sharp rebuke from sen. @entity115 , @entity116			0
" i do n't think you can say it 's appropriate , " @entity115 said			0
" we do n't know what that individual knows and learned while he was working with @entity31 , and we may never know , because he 's now got a lawyer that 's telling him to be quiet			1
" sessions went on to say , " if he were properly interrogated over a period of time , we may find out that there are other cells , other plans , other @entity130 out there boarding planes that are going to blow up @entity37 citizens			0
" others in @entity82 defend decision some , such as sen. @entity137 , @entity138 , were mystified by the reaction to the decision to try @entity20 in federal court			1
the senator cited the example of @entity144 , the so - called @entity144 , who was successfully prosecuted in civilian courts and is now serving a life sentence			0
sen. @entity147 , @entity148 , chimed in , " very successful interrogations have been conducted and very significant intelligence information has been obtained from suspects who have been mirandized			2
" @entity147 said he was not convinced that advising someone of @entity35 rights is a " sort of per - se inhibition on our ability to collect intelligence from an individual			2
" @entity28 spokesman @entity27 defended the @entity2 's decision , touting the bureau 's success in handling terrorist suspects since the 9/11 attacks			2
" those who argue that a different action should have been taken in this case were notably silent when dozens of terrorists were successfully prosecuted in federal court by the previous administration , " @entity27 said			0
he said " results , not rhetoric " will guide the department 's actions			0
a bipartisan group of senators on the @entity178 has introduced legislation that would require @entity37 intelligence officials to be consulted whenever a suspected foreign terrorist is detained in the @entity37			1
sen. @entity182 of @entity183 , the ranking @entity184 on the committee , said the @entity2 action " may have prevented the collection of valuable intelligence about future terrorist threats to the @entity37			1
" committee chairman @entity90 said , " this bill forces the law enforcement and intelligence community to recognize that preventing the next attack should be the first priority			0
" @entity90 and @entity195 also have written a letter to attorney general @entity197 , urging the @entity199 administration to transfer @entity20 to military custody and charge him as an enemy combatant			1
the @entity202 is disturbed by the congressional efforts to treat terrorism as an act of war			0
@entity202 executive director @entity207 said , " to abandon due process in terrorism cases turns the rule of law on its head and flies in the face of the values that we are fighting to protect in the first place			0
" as the congressional hearings demonstrated , the nation 's leaders still have not come to grips with how to handle terrorism suspects			0
there has not been the degree of high - level coordination -- among the @entity224 , the intelligence community and law enforcement -- that one might expect more than eight years after the 9/11 attacks .			0

@entity2 read suspected underwear bomber his miranda rights just hours after being detained
senior intelligence , @entity62 officials testify they were not consulted
some *members* of @entity82 outraged @entity20 was n't held over for military trial
they say he was providing valuable intelligence on @entity31 before being mirandized
