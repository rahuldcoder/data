as soon as passengers arrive at the @entity3 station in @entity4 , @entity5 , it 's clear this wo n't be a typical train journey			1
no crowds , just fellow guests -- and only a few dozen of them -- heading on a three - day trip to @entity12			0
inside the meticulously restored building , champagne flows freely and ceiling fans turn leisurely			0
occasionally the resident peacocks squawk as they preen around the platform , until they scatter with the arrival of the steaming locomotive			1
yes , steaming , as if it was headed to @entity21 , because that 's what this pretty much is : a storybook rail safari through @entity5			1
@entity3 offers a series of journeys across @entity5 and beyond that allow passengers to encounter the region 's spectacular scenery and some of the big beasts that roam it			1
itineraries include trips between the @entity5 cities of @entity4 and @entity36 that take in the @entity37 ( a @entity39 retreat in @entity40 ) or to @entity41 via @entity42 , @entity43 and the @entity45 wildlife sanctuary			1
hot tub on rails the trains are billed as the most luxurious in the world			1
that 's hard to dispute			2
in the 16 - square - meter ( 172 - square - foot ) @entity52 , there 's a double bed , richly upholstered armchairs and a full @entity56 bath for lounging in the tub and watching the world roll by			2
the room for this short trip carries a price tag of 28,600 rand ( $ 2,570 ) a person , but there 's a seven - square - meter @entity64 for half that , or a @entity66 that lands somewhere in between			2
there are few modern nuisances to distract from the landscape views			0
no televisions , no @entity71			0
cell phones are discouraged and laptops forbidden outside of suites			2
" we do n't want any work being done in public , " @entity3 founder @entity75 tells passengers before they board			1
" ambiance and good conversation , that 's what this train is all about			2
" to encourage this , the journey from @entity4 begins with high tea			1
the observation car is at the rear of the train			1
one portion is glassed off to protect the smokers , who have a tendency to wander off when they leave the train to grab a puff			0
it 's not the prime place to be in any case			2
it 's best to claim a spot at the very rear of the car , which is gloriously exposed so passengers can sit on a long bench or lean over the railing to claim uninterrupted views of the goldfields , the @entity107 and eventually the mountains and winelands that surround @entity12			1
dinner gong it 's good to take it easy at high tea			2
before long a gong sounds to call guests to the dining cars for a seven - course meal , each with a wine pairing			1
the food leans heavily toward local fare , both game and produce , all of it meticulously prepared			2
the @entity12 journey is one of the shortest , but includes two stops			0
the first is at @entity128 , the diamond mining town known for the " @entity129 , " the largest excavation in the world , a mile wide and going down seemingly forever			0
the other stop is in @entity133 , in the middle of the @entity107			0
the entire town is a national heritage site , preserving the @entity56 village that was founded as a railway rest stop but became a health spa once frequented by @entity5 's elite			1
although the train is sometimes pulled by a more modern locomotive , the oldest of @entity3 's carriages date to 1930 , two years before @entity145 imagined the @entity147 detective , @entity146 , sleuthing across @entity148			1
most were once owned by @entity149 , and were bought as rusting and decrepit shells			0
before leaving @entity4 , it 's worth taking a look at the original carriages , if only to appreciate how beautifully restored they are			1
as much as @entity3 envelops its passengers in a time warp , they 're not shielded from all modern headaches			1
the growing pains of @entity5 's rails mean delays can and do happen			1
" i ask you to please accept the fact that we are never on time , " @entity75 quips			0
" however , we will get you to @entity12 this week , and that 's what matters			2
" on @entity3 's longer , international journeys into @entity171 , @entity43 , @entity172 and @entity173 , the logistics of @entity5 travel can interfere			1
slow tourism the train stops for border posts ( waits can be lengthy ) and poorly maintained tracks in some regions keep the speeds slow			0
despite all that , this is the best imaginable way to make an overland trip			0
the 15 - day route from @entity12 to @entity185 is a train lover 's dream , taking a meandering route from the @entity12 through the heart of @entity5 , up to the @entity190 and then onto @entity43 for an overnight stay at the @entity192			1
crossing the @entity193 on its landmark bridge is like living on a movie set , the mist of the falls thundering upward on one side , the dark rocks of the gorge plunging down on the other			0
the train then crosses the length of @entity172 , sometimes churning , sometimes crawling until it reaches @entity205 in the rarely visited @entity206			0
here , hikers can explore the sacred cave behind the falls , where the nature spirit @entity211 is believed to live			0
this is a place of prayer and offerings , so the @entity215 has strict instructions for visitors : " because of the sacred nature of the @entity41 , no sexual intercourse , arrogance and quarrelsomeness is allowed in the vicinity of the @entity205			0
" passengers should plan their time accordingly			0
this is literally a high point of the journey			0
the rest of the trip is a descent into the @entity230 , winding through tunnels and along viaducts , with a stop for a game drive in @entity235 , the largest in @entity5			1
@entity236 runs this route five times a year , and it 's their most popular option , according to @entity240 , @entity75 's daughter who works in what 's now a family business			2
regardless of the itinerary , she says for many passengers the train itself is the destination			0
" we want guests to get on board , and it does n't matter where they 're going			0
" @entity3 , @entity253 street , @entity4 , @entity5 ; +27 12 315 8242			1
