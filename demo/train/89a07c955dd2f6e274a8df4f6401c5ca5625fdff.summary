-- @entity1 was a man in a hurry			1
the two - time defending champion at the @entity4 might have been expected to be tested by the new @entity6 champion @entity5 , in their @entity9 opener , but it turned in to a one - sided rout monday			1
world number one @entity1 broke the giant @entity14 no less than six times on his way to a 6 - 1 6 - 1 victory in less than an hour at the @entity17 in @entity18			1
it was the @entity20 's 11th straight victory at the end of season event and his 28th straight in matches played indoors			0
@entity5 's powerful serve , which so helped him to his grand slam triumph at @entity27 , was rendered impotent by the returning brilliance of the number one seed , " it was a great performance obviously , " he said after his quickfire victory			2
" @entity33 was a @entity6 winner but i managed to neutralize his service and get a lot of balls back in play			2
" @entity1 , who is looking to wrap up the season - ending @entity40 ranking , will achieve that feat if he reaches the semifinal stage with a 3 - 0 winning record from the round - robin group			1
he plays @entity45 of @entity46 next on wednesday and the @entity48 champion was also a commanding winner in his group opener			2
@entity45 also dropped just two games in beating giant @entity53 @entity52 in a little over an hour			0
the number three seed has been in poor recent form , but he showed a big improvement against the misfiring @entity52 , who made 24 errors			0
he was damning in his verdict of his performance following the defeat			0
" well , unfortunately it was my worst match of the whole season , " @entity52 told the @entity4 @entity62 website			2
" my game is about hitting the ball nice , clean , then you can create something			0
but that 's the beginning of what i did n't have today at all			0
i hit so many frames			0
" spectators at the prestigious eight - man event have now seen four matches with four straight sets victories , the pattern started as @entity77 's @entity76 beat home favorite @entity79 6 - 4 6 - 4 in the opener sunday			1
@entity81 , who can still pip @entity1 to the top ranking , followed up with a 6 - 1 7 - 6 win over @entity84 as he began his quest for a record seventh @entity4 world tour finals crown .			1
