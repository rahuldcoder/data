-- " the political reality is ... that the @entity3 lobby intimidates a lot of people up here			1
" -- senator @entity6 , 2006 as a result of those words and his voting record , former @entity12 sen. @entity6 's nomination has turned a decades - long , bipartisan confirmation process for secretary of defense into an acrimonious one			0
while some leading figures such as the @entity19 's @entity18 and the @entity20 's rabbi @entity21 say @entity23 's words are borderline anti-semitism , i 'm less worried about anti-semitism and more worried about the judgment of a potential defense secretary who thinks @entity28 has won support because of " intimidation , " not merit			1
@entity28 is widely supported by the @entity33 people because @entity28 deserves to be supported			2
@entity28 is a lonely democratic ally and a steady friend of the @entity33 in a dangerous and tumultuous region			1
their people are like the @entity33 people -- free , independent , capitalistic and tolerant			2
a @entity40 poll taken last year showed 71 % of the @entity33 people view @entity28 favorably while only 19 % view the @entity41 favorably and just 10 % view @entity43 favorably			1
in a @entity46 study last month , 50 % of adults said they sympathize more with @entity28 in its dispute than with the @entity48			2
just 10 % sympathize more with the @entity48 , while about as many ( 13 % ) volunteered that they sympathize with neither side			0
contrary to @entity23 's logic , @entity28 does n't enjoy widespread @entity33 support because anyone -- from any faith -- intimidated someone else ; @entity28 earned the support of the @entity33 people because of its people 's values			1
opinion : @entity23 is a friend to @entity28 the danger in what @entity23 said is if he thinks @entity28 is supported on @entity62 because of intimidation , then it 's not hard to see why @entity23 is so soft in his support for our ally			1
he sees himself as an independent voice willing to stand up to intimidation , and he wears his anti-israel votes as badges of honor			0
but @entity23 is n't independent			0
his position on @entity75 matters is so outside the mainstream of both parties that almost no one agrees with him			0
in 2000 , @entity23 was one of only four senators who refused to sign a @entity82 letter in support of @entity28			2
@entity84 : what 's behind @entity23 nomination fight the following year @entity23 was one of only 11 senators who refused to sign a letter urging president @entity89 to continue his policy of not meeting with @entity91 until the @entity41 leader took steps to end the violence against @entity28			2
@entity95 : why i ca n't support @entity23 contrary to @entity33 's longstanding bipartisan position , @entity23 has called for direct talks with terrorist organizations @entity99 and @entity100			1
in 2007 , @entity23 voted against labeling the @entity101 , the group responsible for the death of many @entity33 servicemen in @entity104 , a terrorist organization			0
and in 2008 , he was one of two senators on the banking committee to oppose a bill putting sanctions on @entity43			0
one of the measure 's biggest backers was an @entity114 senator named @entity115			0
i 'm a @entity116 and neither of my senators -- @entity118 and @entity119 -- supports @entity28 because someone muscled them into that position through intimidation			0
they both support @entity28 because the lobby that wants them to support @entity28 is an @entity33 lobby , made up of people from both parties and all religions and from people with no religion or political party at all			1
but if @entity6 believes that it 's intimidation and not sound judgment that has caused his colleagues to support @entity28 , then @entity6 should not be confirmed as our next secretary of defense			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity141 .			0

in 2006 , @entity23 said ' the @entity3 lobby intimidates a lot of people up here '
@entity141 : the support for @entity28 is n't because of ' intimidation , ' but merit
polls show most @entity33 view @entity28 favorably , but do n't support @entity43 or @entity48
@entity141 : @entity28 is a steady friend of the @entity33 and a tolerant democracy
