-- this week on the " @entity2 " prodcast we talked with our special guest , @entity0 legal analyst @entity3 , about the momentous upcoming week for the @entity4			1
with 11 decisions left and just one week in the month of june to complete their rulings , the @entity4 has held the most anticipated cases until the bitter end			1
among these are rulings on gay rights , same sex marriage , the @entity13 and affirmative action			1
this is the moment where the @entity4 weighs in on the @entity16			2
intense debate and some inevitable outrage seem sure to follow			0
@entity3 , author of " @entity19 " as well as a writer for @entity21 , points out that chief justice @entity22 seems focused on building a more colorblind society as a core part of his court legacy			2
that means decisions regarding affirmative action and the special status of southern states in the @entity13 could move in directions that would upset liberals and african - americans in particular			1
but @entity3 cautions against buying into knee - jerk characterizations and politicizations of complex decisions			2
in particular , he points out that the @entity13 will not be repealed or fundamentally gutted if conservative justices carry the day in the case brought by @entity39 , @entity40 , arguing essentially that the requirements relevant to the 1960s desegregation no long apply			1
on the court 's return to the question of affirmative action , one @entity22 quote from 2007 looms large over the decision : " the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race			1
" perhaps the preeminent civil rights fight of our time is the gay rights movement , and two cases on this front promise to capture the most attention			1
the first is regarding the constitutionality of the @entity63 , passed by @entity64 in the 1990s			0
the second concerns the constitutionality of @entity68 's @entity67 , which banned same sex marriages at the ballot box			0
many close court observers believe that @entity63 will be repealed while @entity67 might be punted on standing			0
this means that @entity75 's hope for a broad @entity77 type decision -- which outlawed state laws banning interracial marriage in the late 1960s -- might be thwarted for the time being			0
@entity82 has been actively following this court case from its inception in @entity68 , where legendary conservative jurist @entity85 banded with legendary liberal lawyer @entity86 to argue that marriage is a basic civil right for all @entity89			0
this kind of bipartisan partnership based on deep principles rather than politics is a model for how to end the @entity16 , whatever the results of this specific @entity4 decision			2
whatever your personal politics , listen to @entity100 jam with us on the " @entity2 " as a curtain - raiser for the pivotal week ahead			1
these cases will affect all @entity89 , and by listening to this podcast you 'll get up to speed , ready to debate the issues and analyze the landmark decisions delivered by the highest court in the land			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity113 .			0
