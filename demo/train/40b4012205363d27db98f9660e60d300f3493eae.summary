-- welcome back to work , @entity2			1
hope you enjoyed your fourth full week off this year			0
now find a way to work together to help get @entity5 back to work			0
experts all say not to expect any constructive action from @entity2 until after the election			1
there is a reason that cynicism passes for wisdom in @entity13			1
but with economic clouds from overseas depressing our own recovery , there is an obligation to act now			0
and , in fact , there is a handful of bipartisan bills that could help get the @entity5 economy moving again if they were enacted			1
these are not @entity27 or @entity28 ideas -- they are simply good ideas			0
and unlike bipartisan pork barrel bills , they cost taxpayers comparatively little to enact			1
let 's take a look at three proposals with bipartisan support that could pass this summer if given a chance			1
public - private @entity38 the bipartisan build act is a no - brainer that has been stalled for no good reason			1
it would create a public - private bank to seed investment in @entity5 's aging infrastructure , improving our resilience and competitiveness over the long term while spurring the economy in the near term			1
" in a time of budgetary crisis , the @entity56 pays for projects with private money now sitting on the sidelines , " attests @entity53 , director of @entity55 's @entity54			0
" every country uses private capital to build projects except for the @entity5			0
" " we are poised for a new era of prosperity if we could gain consensus on the fact that our infrastructure needs to be rebuilt , " agrees @entity65 , the former ceo of @entity66			2
" it was designed for a time in the past when our country had a different population			0
" voters look beyond monthly jobs numbers president @entity78 has backed this bipartisan infrastructure bank bill as more feasible than a version his administration pushed earlier			1
" president @entity78 is the biggest proponent of public - private partnerships to hold office to date , " argues @entity53			2
" @entity84 is a rare case of a popular bipartisan idea , born in the @entity87 , that has been adopted by governors and mayors			2
" it is trickle - down policy - making			2
it 's also smart policy - making that business and labor , republicans and @entity97 , should all be able to agree on			1
the @entity99 2.0 act forty percent of @entity101 companies were started by immigrants to the @entity5 , and more than 40 million jobs were created by new businesses in the past three decades			0
but bureaucratic restrictions are limiting the number of skilled immigrants who can come to the @entity5 , and too often we end up educating foreign students and then kicking them out of our country for them to innovate elsewhere			0
the @entity99 2.0 bill -- co-sponsored by @entity28 sens. @entity112 and @entity113 as well as @entity97 sens. @entity114 and @entity115 -- would allow @entity116 or master 's graduates in science , technology , engineering and math to receive green cards to work in the @entity5 , while also lifting the per - country cap on skilled worker visas			1
@entity78 to call for some @entity128 tax cut extensions in addition , it would create new tax incentives for investments in start - up companies and reduce taxes for businesses in the start - up phase			1
it 's precisely the kind of smart incentive that is key to expanding the @entity5 dream , while keeping the @entity5 a magnet for the best and the brightest from around the world			0
small business assistance the @entity144 and @entity145 of 2012 -- backed by senate majority leader @entity146 and pushed by sen. @entity147 , both @entity97 -- is expected to be brought up for a vote this month			1
it deserves bipartisan support because it builds squarely on a traditionally @entity28 idea : use tax incentives to spur job creation , investment and expansion			1
specifically , the bill would offer a 10 % tax credit for any new hiring or raises this year as well as allow the complete write - off of new capital investments like machinery or equipment consistent with expansion			1
analysis : where are the jobs bills ? much like the forgotten @entity5 middle class , small businesses are the backbone of @entity5 , and they receive far less government attention than big business , despite the fact that they actually employ more people			1
there is a competing @entity177 bill which would double the tax credit -- and therefore , the cost -- of the bill , but which would also apply to hedge funds and the like			2
the differences can be bridged , the common ground defined and then built upon			0
but the focus should be on helping the people on @entity186 rather than on @entity187 right now -- objectively , they need the help more			0
these are all relatively modest measures			0
( we centrists always try to balance idealism with realism			0
) unfortunately , the larger opportunities for broad tax reform or a grand bargain on long - term deficits and debt are unlikely to come until after the election -- and there 's no rational reason to expect that the hyperpartisan politics will end then			2
but that is no reason not to take action on specific targeted bills with bipartisan support right now			1
the enemies of action include lobbyists who want to keep special treatment for their respective industries embedded in the current tax code , or unions that oppose immigration reform for high - skilled foreign workers			2
big ideas with bipartisan support like lowering the corporate tax rate ca n't get traction for these reasons			1
most poisonously , there are extreme partisans in both parties who want to stop progress before the election for fear that the other party might get some credit			0
@entity28 do n't want @entity78 to get visible wins on the economy			0
and some @entity97 are concerned that passing bipartisan bills now will make it harder for the president to run against an obstructionist @entity28 @entity177			2
" the @entity5 people are held hostage to the selfish political interests of partisans on both sides , " says @entity65 , the former @entity66 chief executive			0
there is an old joke among congressmen that every bill is a jobs bill , because it is your job on the line			0
these three bipartisan bills present a win - win on the jobs front -- an opportunity to do well by doing good			1
every member of @entity2 should feel urgency to prove that they can in fact work together on the economy , or face the anti-incumbent wrath of all voters			1
the political courage that is needed comes from looking out for the national interest instead of being driven by special interests			0
governing is not a zero - sum game and just as a rising tide lifts all boats , a growing economy is good for everyone			2
after all , we @entity5 are all ultimately in the same boat			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity271 .			2

@entity271 : @entity2 returns to @entity13 , has an opportunity to help boost economy
he says three bills with bipartisan support could have a strong impact
@entity271 says @entity2 should pass bills to fix infrastructure , help start - up companies
he says a small business bill would provide tax incentives for companies to grow
