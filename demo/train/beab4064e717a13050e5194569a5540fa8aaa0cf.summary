" @entity8 " is being billed as @entity1 's latest solo effort , while " @entity1 " is the first release from his band @entity1			1

the 90 - minute event only contained three live performances , however			0
@entity1 also sought a greater social media influence , joining @entity42 tuesday to host a live q&a with fans			1
the star might not have a full grasp on the requirements of being social online : it took @entity1 three hours to begin his answering duties , and he only ended up responding to one question			2

the appearance was followed by a sold - out @entity75 tour and a headlining gig at the @entity77 in @entity78 in july			0
the release marks @entity1 's return to @entity81 , which released many of the star 's early hits			1
