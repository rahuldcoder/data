@entity0 , the @entity1 -- after four countries , three formal state dinners , two speeches to @entity7 troops and one encounter with a menacing humanoid robot , president @entity3 flies home tuesday having completed his long - awaited trip to @entity13			1
the goals for the visit were ambitious : reassure allies the @entity7 remains committed to a " pivot to @entity13 , " secure new deals to expand trade , and send a message to @entity21 that the @entity7 has its allies ' backs in territorial disputes			1
some of those goals were met ; others less so			2
here are five takeaways from @entity3 's trip to @entity13 : 1			1
@entity21 , @entity21 , @entity21 @entity3 came to @entity13 to bolster ties with @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and the @entity1			1
but his stops in all four countries all seemed designed , in part , to send a message to @entity21 : " we 're on their side			1
" while @entity3 and his aides have been quick to dispel the notion this week 's trip amounted to a " containment tour , " the president 's announcements throughout his visit — mostly military in nature — made clear the @entity46 knew @entity47 was watching closely			2
before @entity3 even landed in @entity48 he 'd taken @entity29 's side in its bitter spat with @entity21 over a set of uninhabited islands in the @entity53 — suggesting the @entity7 would lend support to @entity29 should the squabble escalate militarily			1
@entity3 begins @entity13 tour with reassurance to @entity29 a week later , the @entity46 announced the @entity7 and the @entity1 would enter into a new defense pact that allows for more @entity7 troops in @entity13 — interpreted by @entity21 as an attempt to balance its own presence in a region where land and water are in constant dispute			1
@entity3 denied that was the intention of the agreement			2
" our goal is not to counter @entity21 , our goal is not to contain @entity21 , " he said in @entity0			1
but more troops in the region will undoubtedly be some deterrent against any @entity21 incursion into contested waters			1
for the first time since the 1990s , when @entity7 bases were closed in the @entity1 , the @entity7 will have a substantial military footprint there			2
and that 's no accident , say experts who predict the next major world crisis will unfold off of @entity21 's coast			1
" this is a region that 's going to be on the boil for years and years to come , " said @entity83 , the chief geopolitical analyst for @entity84 , on @entity2 this week			2
" seas crowded with warships , submarines , merchant shipping , fifth generation fighter jets — that can easily create incidents that in turn could enable a crisis			2
" that 's exactly the kind of crisis @entity3 wants to prevent through greater @entity7 attention to @entity21 's neighbors			1
in @entity101 the president said @entity21 " has to abide by certain norms " when it comes to its quarrels with neighbors			1
trade a tougher sell @entity3 's promise of greater @entity7 military cooperation in @entity13 was largely welcomed in the countries he visited			1
less so was his pitch for new trade agreements , which sputtered in @entity29 in the midst of domestic political challenges for prime minister @entity114			2
@entity115 : @entity3 fails to secure breakthrough in @entity29 trade talks the @entity118 would ease business ties between the @entity7 and @entity121 partners — a goal @entity3 claims would create jobs for both sides while opening up new markets for @entity7 firms			2
after several rounds of negotiations , @entity3 had hoped to be able to announce an agreement with @entity29 during his stop in @entity48			2
that proved impossible as talks stalled amid @entity29 concerns over agricultural protections for beef and rice			2
the two sides scrambled to produce evidence of progress , working right up until @entity3 was about to depart @entity29 to provide a positive update on the talks			2
even then , the @entity46 was only able to say the two sides had " identified a path forward " in the negotiations — without specifying where the two sides were coming into agreement			2
" there are still negotiations to be had			0
there are details to be worked out , " said a senior administration official , adding the two sides had agreed only on " parameters " for the deal			0
it was a disappointing result for the first stop of @entity3 's @entity13 trip , though his own domestic politics — including resistance to new trade deals from @entity159 in @entity160 — would have made any new deal a tough sell			1
that political opposition makes it all but impossible for @entity3 to see a new trade deal through @entity160 before the 2014 midterm elections			0
did @entity3 get his pivot ? it would be hard to argue @entity3 was n't making good on his vow to refocus his foreign policy toward @entity13 this week — after a canceled trip and crises in other parts of the world , at least he made it to the continent			1
but the question remains whether the focus can be sustained			0
even as he toured @entity121 capitals and touted cooperation between nations , another international crises — in this case , @entity179 — ended up producing the biggest headlines this week when @entity3 announced more sanctions on @entity185 on monday			0
@entity187 's inner circle hit by new @entity7 sanctions in the coming months , the administration hopes to hammer out a final agreement on @entity192 's nuclear program , rid @entity193 of its chemical weapons , and revive @entity196 peace talks — all issues that have overshadowed the @entity13 pivot in the past			1
is the @entity7 losing its ability to sway allies ? @entity202 : no peace talks if @entity204 is backed by @entity205 the administration has bristled at the notion it can only focus on one issue at a time — as @entity210 , @entity3 's senior director for @entity211 , said before this week 's trip , " we can walk and chew gum at the same time			0
" but as @entity3 has discovered , distractions at home and abroad can gum up even the best laid foreign policy platform			0
political chatter : sanctions , @entity202 's red line his lack of action in @entity193 , for example , ended up causing heartburn for @entity121 allies worried the @entity7 would n't back them if @entity21 crossed a so - called " red line			1
" the unfolding situation in @entity179 — which @entity3 has explicitly said wo n't involve a @entity7 military solution — has @entity121 allies similarly wary			0
during his final stop in @entity13 , @entity3 fiercely defended his foreign policy choices , arguing that his decisions to avoid military force should n't be viewed by @entity7 — or allies — as weak			1
" why is it that everybody is so eager to use military force after we 've just gone through a decade of war at enormous costs to our troops and to our budget ? " he asked in the @entity1			0
" and what is it exactly that these critics think would have been accomplished ? " " we hit singles , we hit doubles , every once in a while we may be able to hit a home run , " he added later			0
" but we steadily advance the interests of the @entity7 people and our partnerships with folks around the world			0
' consoler - in - chief ' travels @entity3 's short stays in @entity30 and @entity31 came at dark times for both nations , still reeling from major transportation disasters that have many questioning each government 's response			0
as he often does at home , @entity3 acted as " consoler - in - chief , " offering support to victims ' families during pauses from policy and diplomatic demands			0
but he avoided taking a stance on how each nation was responding to its crisis — even as shakeups in leadership ranks were brewing			0
in @entity30 , @entity3 presented the country 's president with a framed @entity7 flag that was flown over the @entity46 the same day of the tragic ferry accident that left — at latest count — nearly 200 dead			0
the accident has prompted widespread grief in the country , as well as anger at the government 's response			0
at his next stop , in @entity31 , @entity3 confronted yet another disaster , this time the mysterious disappearance of @entity289			0
like in @entity101 , @entity3 expressed his condolences to victims ' family members — but avoided wading into the controversy surrounding the government 's response			0
officials have come under withering criticism from @entity21 , where a majority of the passengers hailed , accused of botching the search and keeping family members in the dark			1
people to people in @entity13 , @entity3 's chief success on paper was the military agreement with the @entity1 — a pact carefully hammered out by legions of government negotiators over months			1
but @entity3 's calibrated attempts to reach out to people at a personal level also play into his long - term goal of more closely aligning the @entity7 and @entity13			1
as he does in nearly every foreign country he visits , @entity3 stopped at schools and youth centers to meet people going about their lives — and offer them at least a small glimpse at the man whose job is leader of the free world			0
nowhere was that more evident than @entity31 , a country the @entity7 hopes will become a firm ally in @entity13			1
his stop there , the first by a @entity7 president in decades , comes after an economic growth spurt and renewed — though still cautious — desire for ties with the @entity7			0
with that in mind , @entity3 took questions for more than an hour from a diverse group of students at the @entity338 , fielding queries on his younger self , his family , his successes , and his failings			0
when asked about his biggest regret , @entity3 did n't offer political misgivings or wishes for foreign policy do - overs			0
he told the crowd he wished he had spent more time with his mom before her death			0
" i realized that i did n't -- every single day , or at least more often -- just spend time with her and find out what she was thinking and what she was doing , because she had been such an important part of my life , " he said			1
it was a rare look into @entity3 's inner workings , offered not at home but abroad			0
and if @entity31 walked into the forum regarding @entity3 only as a foreign leader , they left with a sense of someone struggling with the same human conundrums as anyone else — perhaps making the gap between nations somehow smaller			0
" our strategy is more than just security alliances or trade agreements , " @entity3 said at the forum			0
" it 's also about building genuine relationships between the peoples of @entity13 and the peoples of the @entity7			1

his stops all seemed designed , in part , to send a message to @entity21
@entity391 was a tough well for him
