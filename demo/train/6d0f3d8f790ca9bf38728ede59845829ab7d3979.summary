-- @entity1 -- the man at the center of an inaugural firestorm -- has built his career on an uncontroversial reputation			2
president - elect @entity6 has chosen @entity1 to deliver the invocation at his inauguration			1
the irony of the furor over @entity1 's selection to deliver the invocation at @entity6 's inaugural ceremony is that the @entity14 minister first drew notice for his determination to expand the evangelical agenda beyond hot - button social issues like opposition to same - sex marriage			1
@entity1 has been described as the next @entity21 , an evangelical leader with a moderate reputation and mass - market appeal -- although instead of massive open - air rallies and an out - sized television presence , @entity1 focused on forging partnerships with unlikely allies working to protect the environment and fight @entity29			2
as a pioneer of the mega-church movement , @entity1 looked to translate traditional evangelical messages for a wider audience			1
he penned " @entity34 , " a spiritually based self - help guide that brought mainstream best - seller status to a muted religious message			0
in his model , everyday concerns were a top priority : attendees at his @entity42 -- now more than 20,000 strong -- could expect free classes on home finance , or assistance with child care needs			0
@entity1 urged ministers to adopt a @entity49 approach : to super-charge the growth of congregations by fine - tuning their pitch for the " un-churched			2
" he released bullet - point sermons with crossover potential , along with material to help churchgoers follow along			0
the church atmosphere he called for was a relaxed one , with dressed - down ministers leading services in nontraditional venues , featuring easy - listening music chosen with younger listeners in mind			0
but even as @entity1 's nonpartisan appeal led to increasingly high - profile roles -- like host of this summer 's presidential faith forum , featuring sens. @entity6 and @entity71 -- controversy grew over his conservative stands on social issues			1
the headlines may be new , but @entity1 's positions are n't			2
during the last election cycle , he sent thousands of pastors an e-mail laying out what he viewed as non-negotiable issues for evangelicals deciding on their pick at the polls , from stem - cell research and abortion to same - sex marriage			0
on wednesday , after @entity6 announced @entity1 as his choice , prominent liberal groups and gay rights proponents criticized the selection			1
some said the choice signaled that @entity6 is not interested in advancing gay rights or protecting abortion rights			1
ireport.com : what do you think of the choice ? @entity99 , president of the @entity100 , said wednesday that he feels a " deep level of disrespect " because of the choice of @entity1 and is calling on @entity6 to reconsider the move			1
read more about the criticism of @entity6 's choice on thursday , @entity6 defended his decision to tap @entity1			1
" and i would note that a couple of years ago , i was invited to @entity1 's church to speak , despite his awareness that i held views that were entirely contrary to his when it came to gay and lesbian rights , when it came to issues like abortion			1
... " and that dialogue , i think , is part of what my campaign 's been all about : that we 're not going to agree on every single issue , but what we have to do is to be able to create an atmosphere ... where we can disagree without being disagreeable and then focus on those things that we hold in common as @entity125			0
" but progressive commentators said @entity1 is a symbol of division			0
" when @entity6 advances a progressive agenda on social issues , as he 's certain to do , @entity1 will continue to speak out on the other side , " wrote the @entity130 's @entity129			2
" only now , he 'll do so with the added authority that comes with being the president 's hand - chosen pastor for the inauguration 's invocation			2
@entity1 's status will soar , and his criticism of @entity6 's policies -- or @entity142 ' in general -- will resonate that much louder			1
" @entity1 himself is working to contain the fallout from his support for @entity14 's @entity146			0
in an interview set to air this week , he denied that his stand against same - sex marriage meant he was homophobic			0
i have always treated them with respect , " he said			0
" when they come and wan na talk to me , i talk to ' em. when the protesters came , we served them water and doughnuts			0
