he 's known as " @entity3 golf 's @entity1 " but @entity4 made a name for himself with his first @entity7 victory on sunday			1
the 23 - year - old won the rain - shortened @entity9 by one shot from former @entity13 @entity12 star @entity11 to become only the fourth @entity15 player to win on the circuit			1
a burly big hitter , he is said to resemble @entity1 , who twice won major titles before his career went off the rails due to his various addictions			1
aphibarnrat , however , has no such off - course issues , though he has been struggling with a thyroid problem according to the @entity25 website			1
" i 'm so happy this week			2
i 'm proud of myself and for my family			0
i almost won here a few years ago ( he tied for third in 2010 ) and finally i made it			0
i 'm so happy , " he said			0
the co-sanctioned tournament was reduced to three rounds due to bad weather , and the final day was also disrupted by storms			2
@entity4 had a one - shot lead after 15 holes when play was halted for two hours , but held his nerve after the resumption as he narrowly avoided a water hazard on 17 and and had to sink a 15 - foot putt to par. he was able to drop a shot at the last for the biggest victory of his career and a $ 458,330 first prize that put him top of the @entity25 money list , with a 54 - hole total of 13 - under - par 203			1
" during the suspension , i could n't eat anything			0
i was so excited , " said @entity4 , who completed a second round of four - under 68 before closing with a 70			1
" when i walked out , everything was shaking , even my voice			0
my caddy told me to just concentrate , just two more holes			0
i 'm lucky that i played only 54 holes			0
otherwise , i am so tired due to the weather and the golf course			0
" @entity11 watched on , knowing that if he had earlier done better than par at 18 he would have been in a playoff			1
the @entity60 had made the halfway cut for the first time in six starts this year since returning from a worrying wrist injury , and was pleased with the improvements he has made under new swing coach @entity67 -- who also works with @entity68			2
" it 's mixed emotions because i 'm very happy to have a good week for the first time in a long time			2
the swing changes are starting to pay off , which is surprising because i thought it would take a lot longer , " said the 32 - year - old , who played on the @entity74 - winning team but has not claimed a @entity7 title since earlier that season , when he triumphed twice			1
" but i 'm disappointed because i had a lot of chances on the back nine , " he added , having carded 67			0
" the 18th is only the second fairway i missed all day which is very disappointing			0
" former masters champion @entity86 had been one shot behind @entity4 at the start of the day , but finished tied for fourth with @entity90 's @entity89 after a 71			1
" it 's a hard week with being on and off the course the whole time , " said @entity86 , whose fellow @entity91 won the tournament last year			1
" it 's difficult to find any rhythm			2
i feel like i swung the club pretty well , but i did n't play that well today			0
" @entity86 was a runaway 11 - shot winner at the @entity99 in december , where @entity4 tied for sixth and @entity1 missed the cut , but this time he had to settle for a minor placing as @entity104 's @entity103 fired 66 to claim third			1
. " for some reason i was hitting short irons all over the shop , " @entity86 said			2
i would 've liked to have applied a bit more pressure on him			0
