@entity0 -- the international community is now waiting for confirmation from the @entity4 and @entity5 on whether a seismic disturbance in @entity7 tuesday is in fact the hermit regime 's third underground nuclear test			1
the area of the disturbance is near the area of @entity7 's two previous nuclear tests			1
the epicenter of the magnitude 4.9 event has little to no history of earthquakes , according to the @entity20			1
if confirmed as a @entity7 nuclear explosion , the event would closely follow a controversial rocket launch from december which marked a milestone in the pariah state 's rocket program			1
the @entity4 and many other countries believe it is a cover for the testing of ballistic missile technology			0
late 1970s with @entity31 technical assistance , @entity7 begins working on the development of short - range ballistic missiles based on @entity35 scud technology , which is itself derived from @entity37 's v - 2 rocket			1
1980 - 84 work starts on the development of the @entity7 's own version of the @entity42 missile system , thought to be designated the @entity43			1
successfully test launches several prototypes with a range of around 300km			0
1985 - 87 deployment of @entity43 begins , followed by the longer range @entity49 ( 500km ) , which gives @entity50 the ability to hit targets deep into @entity5			0
1987 - 95 begins development of no - dong missiles , a " scaled up " version of the scud with a range of 1,000 - 1,300km and much larger payload , allowing it to reach @entity60 and @entity61			0
a no - dong is successfully tested from the @entity64 launch site , traveling 500km before plunging into the @entity65 ( @entity65 )			0
though the project is beset by technical problems -- the missile 's targeting system was inaccurate -- the no - dong arouses particular concern because it could potentially carry a nuclear warhead			2
@entity7 has long been suspected of developing its own nuclear weapons program			1
late 1990s @entity50 introduces the @entity75 - dong - 1 and 2 -- both multi-stage missiles that give them a much longer range			0
a @entity75 - dong - 1 is test - fired in august 1998 -- reportedly overflying northern @entity60 -- in an apparent attempt to deploy a satellite in space			0
though the mission fails , the first two stages of the three - stage rocket separate successfully and travel for almost 1,700km			0
may 1999 former defense secretary @entity84 visits @entity7 and delivers a @entity4 disarmament proposal			2
september 1999 @entity7 pledges to freeze long - range missile tests			1
@entity4 president @entity87 eases economic sanctions against @entity7 just days later			2
a @entity4 - led international consortium also agrees to sign a $ 4.6 billion contract to build two nuclear reactors in @entity7			1
june 2001 unhappy with the progress on its promised power plants , @entity7 threatens to restart its nuclear weapons program			1
it says it will start testing missiles again unless normalized relations are resumed with the @entity4 july 2001 @entity97 reports @entity7 is going ahead with development of its long - range missile			2
a @entity101 administration official says @entity7 has conducted an engine test of the @entity75 - dong - 1 missile			1
december 2001 president @entity101 warns @entity104 and @entity7 that they would be " held accountable " if they developed weapons of mass destruction " that will be used to terrorize nations			2
" january 2002 @entity101 labels @entity7 , @entity110 and @entity104 an " axis of evil " in his @entity113 address			2
" by seeking weapons of mass destruction , these regimes pose a grave and growing danger , " he says			0
2003 @entity7 withdraws from the @entity117 , an agreement that was signed by most of the world 's countries to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons			1
it reactivates its nuclear power facilities and begins test - firing missiles			2
in april that year , @entity50 declares that it is a nuclear power			0
july 2006 @entity7 test - fires six missiles , including a long - range taepo - dong - 2 rocket believed capable of reaching western @entity4			1
the rocket fails after 40 seconds , but @entity4 denounces tests as " provocative			0
" october 2006 @entity7 claims to have successfully tested a nuclear weapon at an underground facility in @entity133			1
days later , the test would be confirmed by the outside world			0
responding to the test , the @entity136 approves a resolution to impose sanctions against @entity7 and require an end to nuclear and ballistic missile tests			1
@entity7 rejects the resolution and walks out of the @entity136 chamber			2
february 2007 @entity7 agrees to take first steps toward nuclear disarmament and shut down its main reactor within 60 days before eventually dismantling its atomic weapons program after six - party talks in @entity150			1
september 2007 in an agreement signed at the six - party talks in @entity150 , @entity7 agrees to begin disabling its nuclear weapons facilities and allow a @entity4 team , including technical experts , to take the lead in doing so			2
august 2008 @entity7 declares it has stopped disabling its nuclear plants and will consider restoring them since the @entity4 has not removed it from a list of states that sponsor terrorism			2
october 2008 @entity4 removes @entity7 from list of states that sponsor terrorism			0
april 2009 @entity7 initiates what it calls a peaceful launch of a satellite , but the @entity97 declares it a " provocative act in violation " of a 2006 @entity136 resolution prohibiting @entity7 from conducting ballistic missile launches			0
@entity7 says any sanctions or pressure applied against it following its recent rocket launch would be considered a " declaration of war			0
" may 2009 a second underground nuclear test is conducted in may that year			1
march 2012 @entity7 declares it will launch a long - range rocket in april to deploy a satellite into orbit			0
april 2012 defying warnings from the international community , @entity7 launches a long - range rocket			0
however it breaks apart before escaping the earth 's atmosphere and falls into the sea			0
in an unusual admission of failure , @entity7 state media announces that the rocket had not managed to put the observation satellite into orbit			0
december 2012 @entity50 announces plans to launch another rocket in a fresh attempt to send a satellite into orbit			0
just two days after announcing that the launch window would be extended due to technical issues , a long - range rocket lifts off from a launch site on the west coast of @entity7			2
amid a chorus of international criticism , @entity50 declares the mission a success and says a satellite was sent into orbit			0
january 2013 a @entity136 resolution submitted by the @entity4 condemns december 's rocket launch and expands existing sanctions			0
in response , @entity7 issues a statement saying that it plans to carry out a new nuclear test and more long - range rocket launches , all of which it said are a part of a new phase of confrontation with the @entity4			1
february 2013 @entity7 appeared to have conducted its third underground nuclear bomb test february 12 , as the @entity20 reported a seismic disturbance centered near the site of the secretive regime 's two previous nuclear tests			1
the area around the reported epicenter of the magnitude 4.9 disturbance has little or no history of earthquakes or natural seismic hazards , according to @entity20 maps			1
" it 's a nuclear test , " said @entity230 , director of the @entity231 at the @entity232 at the @entity232			1
" that magnitude and that location -- it 's awfully unlikely it 's anything else			0
" the reclusive , stalinist state announced last month that it planned a new nuclear test and more long - range rocket launches , all of which it said were part of a new phase of confrontation with the @entity4 .			1

@entity7 appears to have conducted third underground nuclear bomb test
@entity20 reported seismic activity near site of two previous nuclear tests
area around magnitude 4.9 disturbance has little history of earthquakes , says @entity20
" it 's a nuclear test , " says @entity230 of @entity232
