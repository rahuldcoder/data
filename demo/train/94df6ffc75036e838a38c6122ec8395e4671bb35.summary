@entity0 -- poultry workers moving to and from wet markets and farms may be responsible for the spread of the deadly @entity7 virus in @entity8 , says a virologist who 's working with the @entity10 to investigate the outbreak			1
@entity13 clinical virologist @entity12 told @entity1 the closure of @entity16 's poultry markets on april 6 had resulted in a sharp drop in the number of human cases in the city			2
" that is clear evidence that the poultry markets are the primary source of human infection , " he said			1
@entity12 , who visited regions hit by the virus as part of a joint @entity10 mission last month , added that studies of earlier @entity32 bird flu outbreaks in @entity0 had shown that the virus can move between live poultry markets and clean farms through contaminated cages and other exposed items , and this was a likely explanation of how the virus was being transmitted around @entity8			1
" that 's how this infection can keep on zigzagging in this way , " he said			0
since @entity7 was first identified in march , 128 cases have been detected in 10 provinces and 26 people have died , according to figures released on may 2 by the @entity10			2
in addition to markets in @entity16 , @entity8 has also temporarily closed live poultry wholesale markets in @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity57 provinces			1
health authorities are still investigating the possible sources of infection and @entity12 said there was still much work to be done on how the virus had jumped to humans and how it was being spread			2
@entity10 assistant director general @entity65 said in a press conference in @entity67 on april 24 that @entity7 was one of the most lethal influenza viruses seen so far and unusually dangerous for humans			0
the international health body has stressed there is no evidence of sustained human - to - human transmission of the virus , but @entity12 said that it was difficult to ascertain whether clusters of cases within the same family were the result of " limited human - to - human transmission or whether these people have been exposed to the same source " -- such as by visiting the same live poultry market			1
a large - scale study of blood samples being conducted in @entity8 would shed light on whether there had been milder or undiagnosed cases of @entity7 in the wider population -- a key factor in determining the mortality rate , said @entity12 , who played a key role in identifying the virus that caused @entity93			0
" even if there is limited human - to - human transmission , that does n't necessarily have any dire consequences because limited human - to - human transmission has been reported for a long time with @entity32			0
" the visible impact of the virus could also reduce as the hot summer weather approaches but it was unlikely to die out and might re-emerge in winter , @entity12 added			0
@entity1 's @entity102 and @entity103 contributed to this report from @entity67			0
