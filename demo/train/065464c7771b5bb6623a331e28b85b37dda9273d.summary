-- the world 's population is expected to hit 7 billion around october 31 and one @entity4 demographer says that number would have come a lot sooner had it not been for @entity4 's " one - child policy			1
" @entity7 , a professor at @entity8 , says but for @entity4 's population policy , the world 's 7 billionth baby would have been born five years earlier			1
" @entity4 's population would now be around 1.7 billion had it not been for the family planning policy , " said @entity7			1
" and the world 's population would have hit seven billion in 2006			1
" @entity4 holds the largest population on earth with 1.34 billion people , but will not for long , as the fertility level has been declining for years			1
since the @entity4 government adopted its so - called " family planning policy " three decades ago , @entity4 has limited couples to one child , with few exceptions			1
those who broke the rule were slapped with heavy fines or were forced to abort pregnancies			0
since 1979 , experts at the @entity29 of @entity4 say , the policy has prevented more than 400 million births in the country			2
why was the draconian policy necessary ? proponents rationalized it as an emergency measure to curb the large number of births expected from the baby boomers of the 1960s			0
" it was designed in 1979 to be a temporary one that required the ' sacrifice of two or three generations , ' as they put it then , " says @entity40 , who served as the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) representative and senior adviser on population in @entity4 from 1984 to 1990			2
" it was meant to be implemented until the annual population growth rate reached replacement levels , or 1.5 children per woman of reproductive age			2
" the @entity58 demographer says supporters of the policy now cite the double - digit economic growth rate since 1979 as the so - called " demographic dividend			1
" @entity40 explains : " if population control had not been enforced , @entity4 would most likely be economically and socially worse off today			2
" the population policy might have also helped girls and women get ahead , as a survey by the @entity68 and the @entity69 found			2
but the policy has also brought about a list of unintended socio - economic consequences			1
@entity4 's one - child policy has been blamed for abuses , including female infanticide and forced abortions and sterilizations			1
@entity4 traditionally prefer boys over girls because they are seen as more able to provide for the family and carry on the family line			2
as a result , the practice of aborting female fetuses or abandoning infant girls still continues today in rural areas			0
this remains a sensitive topic in @entity4 , poignantly depicted in @entity90 's " frog , " a novel about a midwife in rural @entity4 and her experiences with forced abortions and sterilizations			2
@entity95 recently won @entity4 's prestigious @entity97 literary award -- a potential indication that @entity4 has become more open to talking about the issue			1
@entity4 is now facing a lopsided sex ratio in infants and young children			1
according to the @entity104 , for every 100 @entity4 girls born , there are about 123 boys			2
the global norm is about 100 to 103 - 106			0
at that rate , @entity4 is likely to have some 30 million unmarried men by 2020			2
the unusually rapid decline in fertility has also produced a rapidly aging population			2
two decades ago , demographers say , the share of @entity4 's population aged 60 and above was only 7.6 %			1
that has risen to 10.5 % , according to @entity4 's 2000 census , and has now reached around 12 % , or 167 million			1
by 2025 , demographers predict , one in five @entity4 who live in urban areas will be 60 or older			0
by 2050 , there would be only 1.6 working - age adults for every person aged 60 and above			0
that means a heavy dependency ratio			0
in 10 years , the 20 - 24 age population is expected to comprise of only half of today 's 124 million			1
experts say this could cripple the health care and social insurance system with fewer young people taking care of the aging population			0
if the government does not change its policies , experts say , @entity4 's population could become old before it becomes rich			1
the high cost of the one - child policy is felt deeply by @entity142 resident @entity141 , an only - child daughter of a college professor and shopping mall manager			1
@entity141 , 22 , says she was blessed with all the attention and resources showered at her from childhood			0
still , she says , she had a mostly lonely childhood			0
" i used to cut myself on my wrist after being yelled at by my mom and dad because i did n't know who i should talk to or turn to , " she says			0
" i was like that for almost two years , but i am very tough so i made it through			0
" " i hate to say it but the one - child policy should partly be blamed for some social issues of youth today , " she adds			1
" it 's been a ridiculous government interference on family issues			0
" she wished she had a brother or a sister to share all the attention			0
" i am the only one there , so all their energy goes to me , " she says			0
" they care of no one else but me , and live vicariously through me , because they can count on no one else			0
parents ' love could multiply if there are more kids in the family , but if you are the only one , you get only one piece of cake , not a whole bakery			0
" @entity58 demographer @entity40 says the @entity4 authorities are aware of these unintended consequences of their population policies and are committed to dealing with the situation			1
" it is anticipated that @entity4 's strict population control program will most likely be relaxed as the objective situation changes , " he said			1
for @entity141 's parents , however , such a relaxation of policy may come too late			0
" my parents have often expressed regret , " she says			0
" they said they should have had another kid regardless of how much the [ government ] fined back then			0

if not for @entity4 's one - child policy , world population would have hit 7 billion five years ago
fertility rates in @entity4 , the world 's most populous nation , are declining
supporters of the policy say it helped spur @entity4 's double - digit economic growth
@entity210 's unintended consequences include female infanticide , lopsided sex ratio
