i pump the gas to the crest of the muddy hill , engine roaring			0
a sharp hairpin bend immediately requires a swift swing of the wheel , but the tires keep their grip and i bump my way down a steep incline of mud , rocks and tree roots			1
at the bottom i 'm greeted with a deep flooded section of track and as the vehicle plows through , a colossal splash of muddy water swamps the hood			1
through the swampy greenery of reeds and ferns , i feel , for a moment , like a khaki - clad explorer of the @entity26 , navigating the jungles of @entity28			2
in fact i 'm cruising in a brand new @entity30 , from @entity31 to @entity32 in the @entity33 , on day two of @entity30 's " @entity35 " tour , having kicked off in style with a night of world class luxury at the legendary @entity38			1
my mission is to become even more @entity40 than i already am , delving into my own culture with abandon , discovering the land and its history , in order that one day i might be able to order a " @entity51 , " play a game of croquet and use the word " chap " in a dozen different ways without sounding like a charlatan			0
if my lunch stop is anything to go by , it wo n't be long before i 'm ordering that quintessential @entity56 drink from a butler too -- after a pass of @entity59 and the @entity60 we pull up at the gilded gates of @entity63			0
5 must - play golf courses in the @entity65 @entity63 " welcome to the birthplace of @entity70 and residence of the @entity72 and @entity73 , " announces our host in a cut - glass accent			2
this 18th century @entity75 masterpiece is a @entity76 and despite a recent land - selling controversy , it remains a day trip destination that 'll tire the kids out nicely , with an adventure playground , maze and mini-train just some of the attractions besides the house tour and grounds			1
quickly , we 're whisked off for our victuals in the @entity88 , its colonial furniture and tropical decor harking back to a time when @entity40 really did rule the waves			0
a retired army colonel gazes at the exotic milieu , " ah , could be @entity96 1895 , " he muses wistfully			0
the days of the @entity97 live on in this corner of @entity99			0
strolling around the gardens , i do a mental check of my kit list for the next few days			0
@entity108 hound and a tweed deerstalker cap ? er.			0
. well , maybe that would be taking this whole aristocracy fantasy a bit far but it 's easy to get carried away on this trip			2
this is the @entity99 of @entity115 and @entity116 -- an exclusive tour through our green and pleasant land , staying in historic palaces , ancient manor houses and chocolate box villages along the route			2
traditional country pursuits are all part of the fun too , although nothing as contentious as fox hunting			0
and though i 'm doing this tour in that icon of @entity40 motoring , the @entity30 , it of course does n't take a @entity135 vehicle to negotiate the tarmac roads of southern @entity99			1
which is why we are heading for @entity32 , @entity30 's training and testing ground since 1962			1
the sumptuous castle will be our home for the next two days and when we 're not bouncing around on our antique four - poster beds or rubbing shoulders with suits of armor we 'll be out in the 5,000 - acre estate , putting our off - road driving skills to the test on a private network of forest tracks , steep hills , deep water and of course , this being @entity99 , plenty of mud			1
having " done the practical , " later we 'll find out how this car favored by @entity99 's land - owning elite is actually put together too			1
driving and discovery the @entity163 jacket and green wellies come into their own the following day as we stride out across the castle 's grounds , shotguns over our shoulders for our own version of the legendary hunting parties of the @entity173 and @entity174 age when shooting skills were considered the mark of a man , alongside horsemanship and a stiff upper lip			1
while no feathered friends are bagged ( just pigeons of the clay variety ) , we do get to hang with some top birds -- falcons			0
" now , this is real hunting , " says the falconer with pride			0
" people have been hunting with @entity189 in @entity99 for 1,200 years , since the @entity190 times			0
" never mind the history ; seeing these predators in action gives you a sense of the wild like few other things and its popularity is booming in the country			0
but we must n't dither , for after heading across country , stopping for a proper @entity99 cream tea and a night in the honey - stone village of @entity203 ( it really deserves a nicer name ) we arrive in @entity206 , the home of @entity30			1
this is where we get our petrol head on for the engineering tour of the plant plus a chance to drive some of the vintage vehicles , harking back to a time when men were men and @entity216 were workhorses			1
we 'd already run these machines through their paces at @entity32 , careering through flooded fields and up and down muddy hillocks on the test track -- and now we got to see how all that engineering was put together			1
from what was simply a riveted steel utility vehicle to today 's air - conditioned dream machine with computerized terrain response , the @entity30 really has come a long way since the first series 1 model rolled off the production line back in 1948			1
take it from me -- the men on the trip found it fascinating			0
shaking it all off of course , this being the @entity35 tour means it can end only one way -- with @entity240			2
we 're off to @entity241 to experience the genius of the @entity243 at the @entity244 with the added bonus of dinner on the theater 's rooftop restaurant and @entity249 and petit - fours during the interval			1
and did i mention that we have the best seats in the house ? a final day in the luxurious surroundings of the @entity255 on the @entity256 sees some of the group attend the famous @entity258			1
but for me , the fantasy is over			0
the last six days have been an immersion in elegance , excellence and impeccable good taste -- and a unique window into the grandeur of @entity40 's past			2
i hand over the keys to my @entity30 with a farewell pat , as i know it is unlikely we 'll ever be reacquainted , and make my way back to real life			1
where can one find a decent " @entity51 " ? the @entity273 of @entity40 ' tour runs from august 31 to september 8			2
prices from £ 3,995.00 ( $ 6,463 ) per person			0
@entity258 extension from £ 1,695			2
