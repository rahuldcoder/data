-- manager @entity1 is determined to use @entity3 's first trophy win in six years as a catalyst for future success , following sunday 's dramatic penalty shootout win in the @entity8 final			1
the @entity9 , who is known as " @entity1 " by the club 's fans after a title - laden career as both player and manager , has had a difficult time since returning to @entity17 for a second stint as boss in january 2011			1
mixed results on the pitch and controversy off it -- with the long - running @entity24 race row saga casting a shadow over the club 's reputation -- have meant big challenges for the man guiding one of @entity32 's most successful teams			1
@entity3 failed to qualify for any @entity34 competition this season , and could have faced a similar prospect in 2012 - 13 if sunday 's match against second division @entity38 had ended in defeat			1
however , the club 's fans were celebrating after the 18 - time @entity42 champions clinched their first silverware since winning the @entity44 in 2006			1
it was also the first success for @entity3 's @entity47 owners , the @entity48 , who took over in october 2010			1
the @entity50 match finished 2 - 2 after extra-time , but a penalty miss from @entity38 's @entity53 -- cousin of @entity3 captain @entity54 -- gave the five - time @entity34 champions an eighth success in the competition			1
" our people are absolutely delighted with their first trophy in six years , so it 's been a very good day for us , " the @entity9 told reporters			2
" we 'll just continue to work hard and see where it takes us			0
@entity64 fight back to seal emphatic derby win " although we 've won something today , that 's not us finished			2
we do n't want to stop here -- we want to keep going			0
the best chance we have of doing that is to continue to do what we do best , and that 's to stick together			0
" @entity1 was previously @entity3 manager between 1985 and 1991 , guiding the club to three league titles and two @entity76 wins			1
the 60 - year - old now wants to prevent another long wait for silverware			0
" the idea six years ago was not to go six years without winning a trophy ! we 've won it , we 're going to really enjoy it and we know how much they ( the fans ) have really enjoyed it			0
it gives you a flavor to come back and do it again , " he said			0
" the only reason we 're here is because every member of the squad has contributed to winning this trophy			0
if we all stick together and everybody makes a contribution , we give ourselves a better chance of success			0
" we got here because we worked really hard to get here and because the players are good players			0
" @entity3 are battling to qualify for next season 's @entity103 , a competition they have won most recently under @entity107 manager @entity106 in 2005			1
the seventh - placed @entity108 are seven points off @entity32 's fourth and final qualification place , held by @entity64 , but can reduce that deficit by beating the @entity113 side on saturday following the midweek friendly internationals			2
@entity3 could yet claim a second trophy this season , with the club facing an @entity44 quarterfinal tie against @entity119 on march 18			1
@entity120 would earn a return to @entity50 , with both semis to be played at the national stadium			2
" we 'll go back to work after the internationals and see if we can kick on from here , " @entity1 said			2
" i do n't think anybody who has won a trophy has ever come away from it and said , ' i never enjoyed that			0
' if you get something you enjoy , you 're going to want more of it			0

@entity1 says @entity3 's @entity8 win can be a *springboard* for more trophies
@entity3 beat second division @entity38 on penalties in sunday 's @entity50 final
the dramatic win clinched @entity3 's first trophy since the 2006 @entity44
it is the first success for the club 's @entity47 owners , who took over in october 2010
