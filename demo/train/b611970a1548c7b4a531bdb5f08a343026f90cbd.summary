in a town not far from me , a municipal ballot measure has become a national bellwether			2
the citizens of @entity5 , a working - class community that includes the major airport for the @entity10 - @entity9 area , will vote next month on whether to establish a $ 15 minimum wage for hospitality and transportation workers			1
this is obviously a fight about economics ( a recent report ( @entity18 ) finds that those workers make an average wage of $ 11 today )			1
perhaps less obviously , it 's also a fight about citizenship			2
the @entity25 1 campaign is part of a resurgence of worker organizing across the country			0
fast - food strikes have hit dozens of cities ; autoworkers are unionizing in the low - wage south ; fiercely independent lobstermen in @entity35 have already unionized			1
@entity37 organizers in @entity5 want to ride this wave			0
at the same time , the opposition is strong and well - funded and has the advantage of inertia			1
the airlines and hotel chains opposed to @entity44 1 need only to sow uncertainty and fear about unintended consequences -- the fear , specifically , of the layoffs or cuts in hours that might result if labor costs went up ( and , implicitly , of course , if corporate profits remained untouched )			1
but @entity5 is a town with fewer than 12,000 voters , with many immigrant families and with shops and restaurants where " everybody knows your name			0
" generic talking points and a vague invocation of fear or hope wo n't cut it here			0
every voter 's door in @entity5 can be knocked on more than once , and will be			0
which is why @entity69 , the local union that helped put @entity44 1 on the ballot , is investing heavily in feet on the street and face - to - face persuasion			1
what 's notable in @entity5 , though , is that the people who live here are not pawns in anyone 's game			0
for over three decades , workers in the @entity79 found that as their economic fortunes declined , so did their civic clout			1
now , everyday citizens in and around @entity5 who have endured constant economic insecurity are finding their voice and learning to ask in public whether they should accept as normal a life where working multiple jobs still ca n't push a family out of poverty			1
last week , i heard one of these newly activated citizens			0
@entity92 is a 51 - year - old @entity93 immigrant			1
she works two low - wage jobs at the airport , scanning bags and doing security seven days a week			1
her husband , already past retirement age , cleans hotel rooms			0
five or 10 years ago , @entity92 and every baggage handler and bathroom cleaner and car rental gatekeeper at @entity5 would have silently borne their lot			0
today , they are not			0
they are becoming literate in the language of civic action and political power			2
as i watched @entity92 give a speech at a campaign event , it was very clear that she 'd never done this before -- and that she 'd be doing it again			0
@entity92 spoke of the dollars and cents difference @entity44 would make in her household			1
but her earnest presence testified just as powerfully to the democratic difference it would make			0
the economic rationale for a minimum wage hike is that it creates a virtuous cycle of increasing demand : when workers have more money , businesses have more customers , which means businesses hire more workers , which in turn generates more customers			2
customer creation begets job creation , from the middle out and bottom up			0
the civic rationale for a minimum wage hike is similarly demand - driven			2
when more citizens demand economic fairness , powerful institutions become more responsive , which empowers more citizens to find their voice , which in turn leads our leaders to listen more to citizens			2
it 's citizen creation , from the middle out and bottom up			2
the fight in @entity5 is evidence that the surest way to address economic inequality is to address political inequality : by organizing , speaking up and rounding up the votes to redefine what 's considered normal in public policy			1
indeed , even if @entity44 1 does n't pass , it 's already expanded the " safe zone " in regional politics : both candidates for mayor in nearby @entity10 have now pledged to raise their city 's minimum wage to $ 15 , a move that will have wide national reverberations			1
this era of economic upheaval nationwide and policy paralysis in @entity171 is leading citizens across the spectrum to rediscover the power of collective action			1
the tea party has showed vividly that an activated , well - organized minority , working together , can change the frame of what 's possible in politics			1
now , it 's time for workers stuck in poverty to learn and apply that lesson			0
they may get a living wage			0
they will certainly get a healthier democracy .			0

@entity190 : @entity44 would raise wages by $ 4 for many in @entity10 - area community
he says the effort , organized by union group , is a model of citizen activism
the tea party has showed how citizen organization can sway public policy , he says
*liu* : surest way to address economic inequality is to start with political activism
