-- if the complexity of a country 's tax structure has a direct correlation with non-payment , then @entity1 would win a gold medal			1
the @entity9 country has no fewer than 37 government agencies levying more than 70 unique taxes on various goods and services -- the problem is only a fraction of the population ever pays it			0
at the latest count , just 800,000 of the country 's 180 million people paid taxes , and its budget deficit stood at a massive $ 17 billion , according to government figures			1
tactics designed to raise taxes have ranged from the standard - media campaigns aimed at getting shopkeepers to display their tax certificates , to the bizarre - groups of transvestites hired to ' shame ' tax debtors into paying			0
now @entity1 's @entity31 and @entity32 ( @entity33 ) has weighed into the problem of endemic non-payment with what it hopes will be a permanent solution			1
it aims to put every @entity1 adult into one of the world 's largest multi-biometric databases			2
" we have 452 static centers where people are coming and giving this data , we have 250 mobile vans , we have a motorcycle service , and we ( even ) have people up in the mountains -- skiers and mountaineers with man - pack units , " says @entity33 chairman @entity42 whose mission it is to log every potential taxpayer in @entity1			2
with half the population already registered under the scheme , it 's a platform for paying out benefits , track @entity62 fraud and to track down tax evaders			2
while the @entity1 tax system is riddled with exemptions -- for instance , only those who earn more than $ 3,500 a year , just 10 million people , are subject to income tax -- @entity33 says there are plenty of avenues for raising revenue in a country where those who are eligible for taxes paid an average of just $ 130 a year			1
the department aims to start at the top , identifying people whose conspicuous consumption does not match their tax bill			0
" he has two @entity84 , one @entity85 , 10 bank accounts			0
he travels frequently to the @entity91 , to @entity92 -- he has a lot of money , but he does n't have a national tax number , " says @entity42 , holding the file of one of 3.5 million people @entity33 believes should be paying taxes			0
@entity1 's tax chief @entity96 is calling for a tax amnesty with a difference -- a one - time payment with no questions asked about the past but a promise to file tax returns for the next four years			1
the aim is to bring people into the tax net for life			1
for those who still refuse , @entity1 's @entity109 -- the main tax collection agency -- plans to get tough			1
" we are going to block their @entity62 cards , and we are going to block their bank accounts , and we are going to block their foreign travels until the either pay or file an appeal , " says @entity96			0
while the proposal has yet to become law , the hope is that the new measure will bring down the country 's crippling deficit and its reliance on foreign loans			0
" by not paying their taxes , developed @entity1 are forcing poverty on the rest of the country , " he said			0
under the scheme , a one - off flat payment of 40,000 @entity1 rupees â € ” just short of $ 420 â € ” will wipe the slate clean for even lifelong tax evaders			2
" we will issue notices to evaders after approval of the proposed law , and it will not be very difficult to hit them , as we have full data available about them , whether they are politicians , businessmen , cricketers or showbiz people , " @entity96 told the @entity1 daily @entity137			2
nevertheless , some senior analysts have criticized the scheme as a license to launder money , saying the government should simply crack down on evaders rather than give them breathing space			0
@entity1 's former chief economist , @entity156 , said the plan was unfair to those who did pay taxes and would encourage others to wait for similar amnesties in the future .			1

@entity172 proposed in a bid to draw people into the tax net
