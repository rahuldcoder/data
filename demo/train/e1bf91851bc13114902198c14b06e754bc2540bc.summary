@entity0 -- the rules for takeoffs and landings at @entity6 have changed after two planes came within yards of colliding last month , the @entity2 said tuesday			1
@entity8 , an @entity9 operated by @entity10 , was cleared to take off on runway @entity11 at the same time @entity14 , a @entity15 , was landing on the intersecting runway 29 on april 24			1
the 737 flew 135 yards vertically and 50 yards laterally from the smaller regional jet			0
" the @entity2 has investigated the recent air traffic incident at @entity6 and has taken steps to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future , " according to a statement from the agency			1
runway 29 is no longer used for arriving flights when planes are taking off on the intersecting runway @entity11			1
in the april incident , on air traffic control radio captured by the website liveatc.net , the tower can be heard telling the pilot of the 737 to " go around " and circle the airport			1
the controller told the @entity9 to watch out for the larger plane on the right			0
" yeah , we were putting the nose down , and , he was real close , " the pilot responds			0
close calls at @entity6 have happened before , including four in 2008 , according to a @entity45 inspector general 's report			2
in one instance , on january 16 , 2008 , a 737 from @entity46 ( which has since merged with @entity8 ) was at risk of hitting an @entity9 operating as @entity50			2
it happened at the same intersection and involved the same type of aircraft as april incident , but the planes never got within a mile of each other			1

@entity1 's @entity69 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity2 changes runway rules at site of near miss at @entity6 in april
the aircraft were operating on intersecting runways during the april incident
as a result , one of the runways will not be used for arrivals when the other has takeoffs
