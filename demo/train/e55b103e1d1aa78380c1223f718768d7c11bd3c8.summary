-- @entity1 is back at work			1
republicans and @entity4 are gauging how much progress the lame duck session will be able to make in the coming weeks			1
@entity7 understandably are rolling their eyes , not expecting much from an institution that has been so dysfunctional over the past few years			0
will this be like the productive lame duck session after the last midterm election ? in 2010 , @entity1 passed a tax bill , repealed the " @entity16 " policy for homosexuals in the military and ratified an arms treaty with @entity18			1
" we 're not doomed to endless gridlock , " @entity19 said in praise of @entity1 then			1
in the first week of the current lame duck @entity1 , the @entity23 did pass a bill approving construction of the @entity27			1
it 's not clear what the @entity29 will do when it votes tuesday			0
and since the measure takes the @entity27 decision out of the hands of the @entity19 administration , the president could decide to veto it			0
a productive lame duck session ? do n't count on it			1
the same forces that produced a dysfunctional @entity1 in the past year are fully in place			1
while there have been times when a lame duck @entity1 has had a breakthrough , it would take a miracle for this to become one of those moments			1
both parties have been dug in for the last year and the political pressure to stand their ground is only going to intensify			2
@entity3 know they will have more leverage to get a better deal with their increased representation starting in january , while @entity4 do n't want to use their last month with control of the @entity29 to give away the store			0
for a brief time , @entity1 had virtually eliminated the lame duck period			1
in 1932 , @entity1 passed the 20th amendment , that switched the start date of @entity1 from march 4 to january 3 , which was ratified by the states the following year			1
the practice of @entity1 passing bills after elections had frequently infuriated members of the minority party who believed that their colleagues , some of whom had lost their seats , were making decisions regardless of the democratic will			2
most members of @entity1 assumed that starting the session earlier would do the trick since members would be reluctant to travel long distances just for the few weeks between @entity79 and @entity80			1
this was in the era when long - distance travel was not easy			0
for several decades , the amendment served its function			0
other than an emergency situation , such as the onset of the @entity88 in 1950 , @entity1 did n't do any business in the period after the election			2
but that ended later in the century			0
the advent of cheap airline travel made it easier for legislators to get back and forth quickly			0
starting in 1970 , and accelerating in 1994 , @entity1 treated the post-election period like a normal time of business			1
@entity1 began making some big decisions in the interim period			1
in 1982 , for instance , shortly after @entity4 walloped the @entity3 in the midterm elections , the @entity23 voted to award itself a retroactive pay raise			0
in 1994 , after @entity105 and his fellow @entity3 had shocked @entity106 by taking back control of the @entity23 and @entity29 for the first time since 1954 , @entity1 passed the @entity109			1
four years later , @entity23 @entity3 inflamed partisan tensions by voting to impeach president @entity111			0
in 2002 , following a brutal midterm election when many @entity4 were skewered for being " weak on defense " after 9/11 , @entity1 created the @entity114			2
we certainly should n't expect any big breakthroughs in the coming weeks			0
but as long as members of @entity1 are back they should try to make some incremental progress , given that the midterms were as much an act of protest against @entity106 as an act of protest against president @entity19			2
most important , the departing @entity1 should try to resolve the routine business that has been ignored			2
at the top of the list would be passing omnibus spending legislation , rather than continuing resolutions , so that the government does not face a risk of being shut down			0
it should confirm some executive and judicial branch appointments			0
@entity1 must also make sure that important tax cuts , such as credits for energy efficient homes , do n't expire			1
the second goal should be to start working on loophole - closing tax reform			1
cleaning up the inequitable and inefficient components of the tax code is something that both parties have been talking about for a long time			1
while it is unlikely @entity1 would finish this work during the lame duck period , starting the process would be a great advance			1
tax reform is a way to make the tax burden more equitable and to raise more revenue for the government , by closing loopholes without having to raise rates			1
there is also considerable support in both parties for overhauling the corporate tax code			2
the third important decision would be to boost funding for the fight against @entity162			0
the president proposed that @entity1 authorize $ 6.2 billion for the effort in @entity165 as well as the @entity7			2
given all the attention to this issue before the midterm election this would be a natural topic to address			0
@entity3 sen. @entity171 of @entity172 said that even small measures would help " build trust " for the coming year			0
" you need to have some small victoriesâ € ” or victoriesâ € ” to build trust " but small victories are difficult within the polarized world of @entity180			0
we should n't expect much from @entity1			2
issues like immigration or climate change will have to be left to the realm of executive power			0
but sometimes small steps can be the best path toward progress			0
let 's see what this @entity1 can do .			0

@entity1 is meeting in lame duck session with some big items to *tackle*
@entity196 says past lame duck sessions have proved productive , but this time is different
he says parties are dug in on major issues and may be reluctant to *compromise* now
