@entity0 -- @entity2 keenly remembers the anger and outrage she felt during the 2012 general election when she watched as @entity7 senior citizens were forced to wait in long lines in the @entity10 heat as they cued up to vote at the @entity11			0
a member of her local @entity14 chapter , @entity2 says she was told that she could n't bring them water to drink or chairs to rest in			0
" a poll watcher approached me and said , ' what are you doing ? ' he told me i could n't do that			0
they thought we were trying to sway their votes by giving them water , " she said			0
" it was really sad to me because it was like a reflection of the stories i heard from my grandmother and mother when they had to pay to vote			0
it was a reflection of everything our people have gone through			0
" @entity2 is one of the plaintiffs in a @entity14 lawsuit about new @entity40 voting identification laws , regulations that are considered by some civil rights and liberties groups as among the nation 's most restrictive			1
civil rights groups in that state , and others , fear that election officials and poll watchers , empowered by those new laws will ratchet up the level of discrimination against minority voters			1
" we 've had a serious problem with elected officials discriminating against @entity56 and @entity7 - @entity7 voters			2
it 's obvious that many officials can not be expected to treat these voters fairly , " said @entity58 , an attorney and president of the @entity40 @entity14			2
" when you give them more power to reject black and @entity56 voters at the polls , that power will be exercised and the discrimination escalated			2
" key races to watch in 2014 @entity40 voting officials have said the state 's new photo voter identification law will help tamp down fraud			2
" the @entity78 @entity77 has already ruled that voter id laws do not suppress legal votes , but do help prevent illegal votes , " @entity40 attorney general @entity75 said last year , according to media reports			1
the hunt for fraud when they head to the polls in this fall 's midterm elections , some voters in nearly half of the country will find it a lot tougher to cast ballots due to new voting laws , according to a new report by the @entity95			1
it is a legal think tank at @entity97 that has criticized the increase in what it sees as prohibitive voting measures			2
most of the laws were approved by @entity104 - dominated legislatures and in states that saw greater minority voter turnout in the 2008 and 2012 general elections , the report found			1
civil rights groups and voting rights advocates see the spate of new laws as a way to disenfranchise and intimidate minority voters and suppress turnout during high - stakes elections			1
others support the changes and see the laws as the best way to preserve integrity in the voting process			2
such groups as the grassroots @entity123 in @entity124 and @entity125 the vote , a conservative group in @entity40 , supports citizen enforcement of the new voter laws , acts that often mean sifting through voter rolls and pounding on doors in search of fraud			1
true the vote announced this week that it is suing the @entity136 secretary of state and that state 's @entity104 over the right to look at the poll books and ballots in order to ensure that @entity143 primary voters did n't also illegally vote in last month 's @entity104 primary runoff			0
in @entity136 , voters who do n't cast ballots in a primary election can vote in either party 's runoff			0
@entity136 state sen. @entity150 , who lost a bitter runoff against incumbent @entity104 sen. @entity152 last month , is citing what he sees as " illegal " and " unethical " behavior among @entity7 @entity143 who cast ballots for the veteran lawmaker			0
@entity150 said many of those voters participated in the @entity143 primary and should n't have been allowed to vote in the @entity104 runoff			0
" @entity162 has been inundated with reports from voters across @entity136 who are outraged to see the integrity of this election being undermined so that politicos can get back to business as usual			0
enough is enough , " @entity162 president @entity169 said in statement			0
vigilante or vindicator ? one man 's bid to root out voter fraud tough new laws the nation 's new crop of voting laws run the gamut from dialing back early voting hours to new requirements for photo identification to stricter rules for voter registration			1
a few examples : and , in at least seven states , including @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity124 , suits challenging new voting restrictions are wending their way through state and federal courts and could potentially impact the outcome of the 2014 elections			1
" the rules of the game " this all follows a @entity78 @entity77 decision last year striking down provisions of the @entity202 , which required a number of states — many of them in the @entity206 — to get clearance from the @entity208 before changing their voting laws			1
without that protection , voting rights advocates say , in states with a history of discriminatory voting practices against racial minorities those who seek to unduly influence elections will find it easier to suppress votes			1
2012 increase in voting @entity222 laws " we have seen a dramatic increase in politicians trying to manipulate the rules of the game in terms of making it harder for citizens to vote , " said @entity223 , a senior counsel at @entity224 's @entity95			2
the flurry of new and more restrictive voter laws coincided with the 2010 elections and new @entity104 majorities that came into power , @entity232 said			1
in 2012 , the increase in laws reached a fever pitch when 19 states put forth measures civil rights groups view as restrictive			1
now , as the 2014 midterm elections loom , voting rights advocates point to scenarios in the 2000 and 2012 general elections in @entity248 , where there was confusion about voting methods , laws and long lines , as a model for what could happen elsewhere in the country			1
" i guess you could say we 're ahead of the curve on voter suppression , " said @entity257 , president of the nonpartisan @entity258 of @entity248 adding that the state has since passed a series of election reform measures which have improved voting			2
" when it comes to @entity248 , we first saw the impact of taking away days and times to vote			0
and the legislators were properly shamed and embarrassed			0
it 's unfortunate that other states have to experience that			0

a slate of new voter laws could impact the 2014 elections , experts say
civil and voting rights advocacy groups say many of the laws disenfranchise minority voters
the laws include stricter voter id requirements , cuts to early voting , among other provisions
the changes , along with court ruling on the @entity202 , could impact minority voters
