@entity0 -- at the conclusion of one of @entity8 's most high - profile criminal cases , the verdict and sentencing of @entity4 did not surprise many observers			1
the guilty verdict had been widely expected , as @entity4 had confessed , during her one - day trial earlier this month , that she and an aide poisoned @entity14 businessman @entity13			1
the high - powered wife of deposed @entity8 politician @entity16 had blamed a " mental breakdown " for her actions			2
in the end @entity4 escaped with her life after receiving a suspended death sentence , though she 'll likely be jailed for life			1
her aide , @entity23 , also was found guilty monday in @entity13 's death and sentenced to nine years in prison			0
the @entity14 embassy in @entity27 issued a statement saying it did not want the death penalty applied in the case			0
" we welcome the fact that the @entity8 authorities have investigated the death of @entity13 , and tried those they identified as responsible , " it said			2
" we consistently made clear to the @entity8 authorities that we wanted to see the trials in this case conform to international human rights standards and for the death penalty not to be applied			2
" but others believe the verdict was a forgone conclusion			0
ahead of the trial , @entity43 , professor at @entity44 and writer of the @entity46 , wrote in an opinion piece : " most china - watchers assume that proceedings in this case have been tightly controlled to ensure that only the officially approved narrative emerges			0
" they assume that the verdict was decided in @entity27 before the opening gavel sounded , and that the proceedings were merely a performance for the benefit of the public , a kind of judicial shakespeare - in - the - park , but without the drama			0
" discussions of the @entity16 and @entity4 were blocked on @entity62 , @entity8 's popular microblogging site			1
but @entity8 netizens discussed the verdict , alluding to the political saga and voicing skepticism			1
" as was expected , they 've had a deal earlier , " wrote user buzaishiwonaishijidu			0
@entity62 user sunshinecn2011 wrote , " delayed death penalty ! ! and it will turn into a life imprisonment , and then into fixed - term imprisonment , and after several years , it is happy life again			0
" some focused on the differences in capital punishment between ordinary citizens and political elites			0
one user , @entity81 , posted that the death penalty was " a special offer only for ordinary people			0
" in @entity8 , non-violent offenders , such as drug smugglers and food safety violators , can be sentenced to death			2
according to @entity89 , @entity8 is believed to carry out the death penalty more than the rest of the world combined			1
" @entity8 is believed to have executed thousands in 2010 but continues to maintain its secrecy over its use of the death penalty , " according to the @entity89 report			1
" @entity8 used the death penalty in 2010 against thousands of people for a wide range of crimes that include non-violent offenses and after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards			1
" the most popular comments on @entity1 's story about @entity4 carried similar themes			2
" @entity8 executes thousands of people every year , including those convicted of crimes like corruption and drug trafficking			1
and yet this woman , found guilty of a cold - blooded homicide , is spared			0
i guess being married to a party official -- even a fallen one -- does have its privileges , " wrote one user called @entity111			0
another @entity1 commenter questioned the severity of @entity4 's sentence compared with dissidents in the country			1
" @entity120 convicted for taking part in @entity123 protest sentenced to 22 years jail ... @entity125 ( nobel peace prize winner ) convicted of ' inciting subversion of state power ' for writing part of charter 08 sentenced to 11 years jail			0
and the list goes on ... way to demonstrate @entity8 's rule of law ? ? so people with independent ideas or thoughts are viewed as more of a threat that a cold - blooded murderer ? " @entity1 's @entity139 , @entity140 and intern @entity141 contributed to this report .			1

@entity4 's suspended death sentence did *n't* surprise @entity8 observers
