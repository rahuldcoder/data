@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has one piece of advice for anyone seeking to come out of the shadows and pursue a path to @entity10 citizenship : do n't do it			1
she says her decision to become a legal citizen is one of the reasons her husband was murdered			1
" i should 've stayed illegal this whole time , " the 21 - year old widow said			0
" @entity18 would still be here			0
" @entity19 , an @entity10 citizen , had traveled to @entity20 , @entity21 , last year to protect his wife as she waited for the long , complicated process to attain @entity10 citizenship			1
instead , @entity19 -- who had never been to @entity21 and did n't speak @entity25 -- became one of the thousands of homicide victims in @entity20 as his family watched helplessly			1
@entity3 and @entity19 were high school sweethearts in @entity0 , @entity1 , and they got married at 18 after she gave birth to their son , @entity31			2
@entity3 decided that the next step to build her new life with her husband and child was to apply for @entity10 citizenship			1
her parents had brought her to the @entity10 illegally at the age of 7			1
although @entity19 was an @entity10 citizen , their marriage did n't automatically give @entity3 legal status , so she still faced possible deportation			1
so the 18 - year - old couple began navigating the intricate @entity10 citizenship laws and regulations without the help of a costly lawyer			2
when @entity3 tried to apply for citizenship , she learned that federal law said she had to leave the @entity10 and barred her from returning for up to 10 years because she had resided in the country illegally			1
she could apply for a hardship waiver requesting that @entity10 immigration officials not separate her from her husband and child , both @entity10 citizens			1
but she had to file that waiver in her birth country , and that meant packing up and moving to @entity20 , @entity21			1
every year , more than 100,000 people travel to the @entity10 consulate in @entity20 to attain legal status			1
the consulate was set up to handle the permanent immigration visas years ago before the city became so violent			0
immigration attorney @entity62 calls the policy a perfect catch - 22			2
" it 's an impossible situation : they have the option of staying here unlawfully , not being able to get their residence now or ever , or going and living in the city of @entity20 , a place where people do get murdered all the time , " @entity62 said			1
@entity3 left her husband and young son in @entity0 and attempted to live in her native @entity21 , where she felt like a foreigner			1
she lived with her grandmother in @entity20 , where more than 3,000 people were murdered in 2010			2
last year , that number fell to just below 2,000 -- the first time the murder rate has dropped in four years			0
" we were aware of everything , " @entity3 said of the dangers in @entity20			1
" i mean , where we lived was a really bad neighborhood			0
we would drive by , and there were a couple shootings , and they had the bodies right there and everything			0
" meanwhile , back in @entity0 , the separation was proving even more difficult for @entity31 , and it was n't long before @entity19 packed up and moved to @entity20 to keep his family together			2
in a letter to the consulate , @entity18 pleaded for a hardship waiver allowing his wife to live in the @entity10 while awaiting permanent legal residency			1
" i am living with my wife and son in perilous and very dangerous conditions in @entity20 , @entity21			1
we live with fear of our lives on a daily basis , " he wrote			0
" as @entity105 , my son and i are facing extreme danger everyday we wake up in one of the most violent cities in the world			2
" his plea went unanswered , and within six months , @entity19 's fear proved prophetic			0
he was shot more than 80 times outside the family 's home			2
@entity3 's uncle was also killed in the attack			1
the motive was unclear , although the family suspects robbery			0
" the last thing i heard was him saying , ' i do n't speak @entity25 , ' ' no hablo @entity122 , ' and that 's it			0
and then i just heard the shots , and then i waited for a little bit because i was scared to go down there			0
i just went down there with @entity31 and my grandma , and they were right there on the floor , on the ground , " @entity3 said			2
@entity3 was covered in her husband 's blood before she realized she was still holding their 2 - year - old son			1
that night still haunts her			0
" it 's hard to sleep at night , because every time i think about them , the image pops in my head of them , they 're on the ground			0
and as much as i try to block it out of my head , i ca n't , " she said , wiping away tears			0
today , @entity3 and her son live in @entity0 , where she has a green card and is awaiting awaiting a path to permanent citizenship			2
" the tragedy that this family has suffered is most unfortunate , most tragic , " said @entity152 , the director of @entity153			0
" what we can do within the current laws is develop process improvements that mitigate the dangers and hopefully avoid tragedies to the best of our abilities			0
" @entity153 has recently proposed a rule change aimed at reducing the time @entity10 citizens are separated from their spouses and children during the process of becoming legal immigrants			1
the proposal would streamline the process of obtaining hardship waivers by allowing @entity153 to process certain waiver applications in the @entity10 before an applicant departs for an immigrant visa interview with a @entity10 consular officer abroad			1
in other words , it would reduce both the time the family spends apart and the time spent in harm 's way in places like @entity20			1
@entity152 says that as it stands , the immigration system punishes those who , like @entity3 , attempt to obey the law			2
" i have been working in the immigration system now for almost two and a half years			0
as a federal prosecutor , i worked in enforcing immigration laws throughout the 1990s for approximately 12 years			0
working in the system now , it is evident to me that the concern about a broken immigration system is indeed warranted and well grounded , " @entity152 said			0
the proposed rule change still has to go through several steps including a period of public comment before becoming official			0
but whenever it happens , it will be too late for families such as those of @entity200			0
@entity2 's @entity201 contributed to this report .			0
