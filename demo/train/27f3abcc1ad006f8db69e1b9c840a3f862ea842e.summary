-- before i set out to travel this world , 12 years ago , i used to believe that the human race as a whole was basically a few steps above wolves			1
that given the slightest change in circumstances , we would all , sooner or later , tear each other to shreds			2
that we were , at root , self - interested , cowardly , envious and potentially dangerous in groups			2
i have since come to believe -- after many meals with many different people in many , many different places -- that though there is no shortage of people who would do us harm , we are essentially good			1
that the world is , in fact , filled with mostly good and decent people who are simply doing the best they can			1
everybody , it turns out , is proud of their food ( when they have it )			2
they enjoy sharing it with others ( if they can )			0
they like a good joke			0
sitting at the table has allowed me a privileged perspective and access that others , looking principally for " the story , " do not , i believe , always get			1
people feel free , with a goofy @entity44 guy who has expressed interest only in their food and what they do for fun , to tell stories about themselves -- to let their guard down , to be and to reveal , on occasion , their truest selves			1
i am not a journalist			0
i am not a foreign correspondent			0
i am , at best , an essayist and enthusiast			0
i hope to show you what people are like at the table , at home , in their businesses , at play			1
and when and if , later , you read about or see the places i 've been on the news , you 'll have a better idea of who , exactly , lives there			0
" @entity74 " is supposed to be about food , culture and travel -- as seen through the prism of food			1
we will learn along with you			0
when we look at familiar locations , we hope to look at them from a lesser - known perspective , examine aspects unfamiliar to most			2
people , wherever they live , are not statistics			1
bad things happen to good people all the time			2
when they do , hopefully , you 'll have a better idea who , and what , on a human scale , is involved			0
i 'm not saying that sitting down with people and sharing a plate is the answer to world peace			1
not by a long shot			0
but it ca n't hurt			0
