-- unprotected sexual behavior among men who have sex with men has risen steadily since 2005 , according to a report from the @entity6 , released just before @entity7			1
the data , drawn from the @entity9 , indicated a rise in unprotected anal intercourse by 20 % in a one - year period and were seen by some as a call to arms			0
does this mean gay men are no longer worried about @entity18 ? many health commissioners and policy - makers on both the local and national levels , old - school activists , fellow academics and researchers and reporters used these data to augment their argument that @entity18 is no longer an issue of concern for gay men , whose primary route of transmission is unprotected anal sex			1
it has been suggested that gay men , especially young gay men , no longer fear contracting the disease , that @entity7 is perceived as an easily managed chronic condition and that infection holds little consequence for those newly diagnosed			1
and then the " blame game " begins , which does nothing to help deal with the issue			0
interactive : @entity7 2013 the reality is that some of my peers and members of my own generation , the @entity45 -- those of us who lived through the most dismal and darkest moments of aids epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s , prior to the implementation of effective therapies in 1996 -- also expressed similar horror when i interviewed them for my book last year			0
in fact , this very issue -- that of finger - pointing and assignment of blame and shame to gay men -- came through very clearly in the voices of the men during the course of our conversations and interviews			1
what came across from most of these 15 men reflected many emotions including concern , confusion and anger			0
but mostly what was obvious was a voice of disbelief among these men who became infected at time when we knew little about hiv / aids and who find it unfathomable that young gay men would place themselves at risk , given all that we know about the disease and its transmission three decades later			1
i often pushed back in these interviews to help these older men , the elder statesmen of the gay population , develop some more compassion about the lives and experiences of young gay men			1
for the past decade , i have been undertaking bio-behavioral studies of risk and resilience with young and emerging adult gay men			1
these studies include assessments of sexual behaviors and hiv testing			0
more than 30 years on , slow - motion @entity7 catastrophe continues and what is clear to me and my team at the @entity110 is this : the notion that young men do not fear @entity18 nor are worried about @entity18 is a myth that needs to be dispelled			2
it undermines the lives and struggles of a new generation of gay men trying to make their places in the world and coming of age in this , the fourth decade of @entity7			1
it is obvious that the @entity7 epidemic of my generation -- the loss and confusion and devastation that we witnessed for some two decades -- is not the same @entity7 epidemic for new generation of young gay men			2
and for that i am eternally grateful			0
i am relieved that these young men will not have to experience the loss and death and trauma that we experienced , i am comforted in the fact that there are effective treatments available to help maintain their infection , and i am joyful every time another state enacts marriage equality , which puts our loving relationships on equal footing with heterosexual couples			0
the current state of affairs just makes the lives of a new generation of gay men different from those of the @entity45 , and we should celebrate that -- not let our anger , and the trauma and grief created by our own experiences , tarnish the progress we have made			2
but mostly , i am not in any position to judge the choices these men make about their sexual behaviors			0
the truth is that @entity18 is no longer a death sentence , and to expect a new generation of gay men to perceive it in that manner is unreasonable , unwarranted and unrealistic and seems to be dictated by anger on the part of some that @entity18 is no longer front and center in the minds of many young gay men -- or older gay men , either			1
@entity175 : where to put the smart money to end @entity7 the disease may not be front and center -- it may not be the primary presenting problem faced by young gay men , as it was for me at age 18 in 1981 -- but it is a concern			2
however , it 's a concern that must be spoken about and dealt with differently for this " new " @entity7 generation			0
in the end , a major tool we have in our arsenal in the fight against @entity18 rests in our own experiences			0
the artificial divide that exists between my generation , the @entity45 , and new generation of gay men must be bridged			1
as we emerge into these later stages of life , perhaps battle - scarred from 30 years of living through the @entity7 crisis , we also have an obligation to act as mentors to a new generation of young gay men and share our stories of survival and resilience , as we learned from the generation that preceded us and lived through the @entity205 and the onset of gay liberation			2
if we want to truly protect young gay men from @entity18 , we must share our life experiences and struggles openly and honesty , and we must release our judgments and biases about their lives and loves in a new and very different culture and world			1
together , as one group , older and young , positive and negative , we can battle the true enemy : the virus that has plagued us for way too long			0
opinion : wrong time to reverse course on hiv / aids the opinions expressed are solely those of @entity224 .			0

a new report shows that unprotected sex between men is on the rise
some have *surmised* younger gay men are *n't* concerned about @entity18
an " artificial divide " between generations must be bridged , @entity224 says
