@entity0 -- @entity3 intelligence now believes @entity4 did not gain access to the " crown jewels " of @entity8 programs that secretly intercept and monitor conversations around the world , @entity1 has learned			1
the @entity12 administration is reviewing what the admitted leaker of classified information actually got his hands on and what damage he may have caused			1
the ongoing damage assessment indicates he did not gain access to what is called @entity21 or " extremely compartmentalized information , " according to a @entity3 official familiar with the review			1
@entity4 fled to @entity25 after his leaks in june and has been stranded at the @entity25 airport awaiting a response to his request for temporary asylum			2
he faces espionage charges in the @entity3			0
with @entity4 still at large and the publication of agency surveillance secrets publicized , the intelligence community may have good reason to downplay the impact of what he has revealed			1
however , the official said the intelligence community remains adamant that @entity4 caused serious damage			1
the administration believes it knows the extent of the material that was downloaded			0
" we are not downplaying it , " the official said , explaining that assessing the matter over weeks has enabled authorities to focus more directly on the impact of @entity4 's actions			1
court renews secret @entity3 surveillance program the official spoke to @entity1 on background because the assessment is not fully completed			1
@entity1 can not independently verify the statements made either by the administration or @entity4			2
officials do not dispute that @entity4 had critical information about how @entity8 programs worked			1
" but just because you have the blueprints does n't mean you have the manual , " the official said			0
a key question is whether @entity4 , a former @entity8 contractor , really knows how the programs work at a detailed technical level			2
@entity4 did leak sensitive documents about anti-terror programs , detailing secret telephone metadata and e-mail surveillance			1
@entity3 officials have said that terror groups are aware of the @entity4 leaks and are responding internally , like adjusting communications and security			2
@entity8 director @entity77 said last week the @entity3 has concrete proof terrorists are making changes and taking actions that are going to " make our job harder			0
" other officials are less resolute about the extent of the exposure			0
the top lawyer for the @entity86 said it is not clear how much @entity3 adversaries will adjust based on what is known already			0
ex-cia chief : what @entity4 did " it 's too early to tell yet whether it is going to have an impact , but there 's no question that they have sat up and taken notice of specifically what has been released here and the impact it has on their communications , " @entity92 , general counsel for the national intelligence office said last friday			2
the assessment also has concluded that @entity4 took advantage of knowing that a good deal of information was concentrated in one portion of the @entity8 's computer system			1
" what he had was information that was centralized so it could be shared broadly , " the official said			2
this is similar to the assessment reached in the case of @entity119 pvt. @entity118 where information was stored in ways that large numbers of personnel could access it under certain circumstances			0
@entity118 is accused of leaking documents to @entity127 in the largest case of its kind in @entity3 history			0
he is currently on trial before a military court			0
deputy defense secretary @entity134 said last week that @entity4 exploited a weakness that came from a desire to make the information more accessible to those in the intelligence community			1
" in an effort for those in the intelligence community to be able to share information with one another , there was an enormous amount of information concentrated in one place , " @entity134 said during a panel at the @entity141			1
" it creates too much information in one place			0
" as such , the government has accelerated efforts to better secure classified information , improvements that had begun even before @entity4 went public			1
the government believes @entity4 was aware that upgrades were being made to @entity8 systems tagging data and users so that downloads were recorded , but @entity4 accessed portions where that work had not been completed			0
in addition , system administrators like @entity4 and others will be subject to more stringent rules			0
downloads will require a second more senior employee to " watch , log and observe " what material is being accessed the official said			0
access codes and passwords also have been changed .			0

@entity4 admittedly leaked classified information on surveillance programs to media
@entity12 administration officials have been conducting an assessment of *potential* damage
the intelligence community adamant @entity4 caused serious damage , official says
assessment also finds @entity4 knew a good deal of information was in one place
