two scientists in @entity1 and one at the @entity3 at @entity4 were awarded this year 's @entity5 in physics for helping create the led light , a transformational and ubiquitous source that now lights up everything from our living rooms to our flashlights to our smart phones			1
the awarding committee said the trio 's work is in keeping with the spirit of @entity18 , the founder of the prize , because led lights save on energy , last long and are environmentally - friendly because they do n't contain mercury			1
they " hold great promise for increasing the quality of life for over 1.5 billion people around the world who lack access to electricity grids , " the awarding committee said			2
specifically , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 were honored for inventing the blue light emitting diode			1
red and green diodes had been around for years			1
but when the three created the blue diodes in the early 1990s , only then could the white lamps that glow from every corner of our world be created			1
for 30 years , scientists had tried to create the blue diode			2
" they triggered a fundamental transformation of lighting technology , " the committee said			0
" they succeeded where everyone else failed			0
" led lights last longer and are more efficient than regular light bulbs and fluorescent lamps			1
@entity53 goes for work on cells that form brain 's gps system not prepared for it @entity33 , a scientist at the @entity3 , @entity4 , said by phone that receiving the news that he had won the nobel prize was " unbelievable			1
" @entity31 and @entity32 are affiliated with @entity62 in @entity1			0
@entity32 was on a flight when the committee tried to call him so was not able to hear the news in advance of the news conference , the committee said			0
@entity69 , permanent secretary of the @entity70 , said that @entity33 and @entity31 had been thrilled to learn they were prize winners			2
" i think they were not prepared for it			0
they had not been waiting up all day and all night for this call , " he said			0
the three winners will share the 8 million @entity78 kronor ( $ 1.2 million ) attached to the prize			0
last year 's physics prize went jointly to @entity81 of @entity82 and @entity83 of the @entity84 for the theory of how particles acquire mass. their theoretical brilliance was borne out when researchers confirmed the existence in 2012 of the @entity91 , or " @entity93 particle			0
" the @entity5 prizes in chemistry , literature and economic sciences will be announced later this week , as will the @entity98 .			2

scientist @entity33 says winning the @entity5 is " unbelievable "
committee : trio 's work is in keeping with the spirit of @entity18
they invented the blue light - emitting diode
*coupled* with the red and green , it creates white led lights
