@entity0 held a huge rally friday in the center of its capital , @entity5 , to celebrate the launch of a long - range rocket this week that put a satellite in orbit and provoked international condemnation			1
a special broadcast on state - run television showed crowds of soldiers and civilians standing in neat ranks , clapping and cheering as officials made congratulatory speeches praising the regime 's ruling dynasty			1
the rocket launch wednesday took place sooner than many observers expected and was criticized by many countries since it was widely seen as a cover for testing ballistic missile technology that @entity0 has been forbidden from using by the @entity27			1
but state media reported friday that the satellite is weather - related and will " gain information on temperatures of sea and land surfaces and atmosphere , humidity and wind and other meteorological data			1
" putting the satellite in orbit was a technological breakthrough for the secretive @entity0 regime , and a public relations victory for its young leader , @entity44			1
@entity0 claims the launch was carried out for peaceful purposes			0
the successful launch was the result of @entity44 's " unique will , courage and boldness , " @entity47 , said at the rally friday , his words echoing out over the assembled masses , many of whom were wearing thick coats as they stood in a snow - dusted square			0
@entity44 's late father , @entity60 , was also singled out as having made the launch possible through his military - first policy that channeled billions of dollars into the development of missiles and nuclear weapons			0
more crowds are expected to gather in @entity5 on monday , the first anniversary of @entity60 's death			0
@entity0 's achievement of putting an object in orbit , after years of failed attempts , stoked fresh concerns among world leaders about the reclusive state 's missile and nuclear programs			1
experts do not believe @entity0 has a nuclear warhead small enough to fly on the kind of missile that @entity5 has now proved it can send long distance			0
and the @entity83 believes the @entity0 may not have full control of the satellite they launched into space , according to a @entity83 official who declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the information			0
but the launch allowed the regime to flex its military and technological muscle on the world stage			0
@entity44 has " stressed the need to continue to launch satellites in the future , " the state - run @entity95 said in a report thursday , raising the prospect of more controversial moves in the future			2
state media also released images of @entity44 apparently watching the launch unfold			1
he was shown sitting with a cigarette in his left hand before a large screen that appeared to display the rocket 's trajectory			0
members of the @entity112 condemned the rocket launch wednesday , and the @entity83 is pushing for tougher sanctions on @entity5			2
but @entity115 , @entity0 's main ally and the holder of veto power at the @entity27 , has so far taken a cautious stance , urging the @entity112 to be " prudent " on the issue and " avoid escalating the situation			2
