-- a @entity2 lesbian tuesday won a judge 's backing for her contention that her first amendment rights were violated when her high school refused to allow her to attend her prom with her girlfriend			1
but @entity11 district judge @entity10 refused to order the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity2 , to hold the dance it had canceled over the matter			1
in his 12 - page order , @entity10 also ruled that @entity12 's denial of 18 - year - old @entity20 's request to wear a tuxedo to her prom was a violation of her rights			1
" the record shows @entity28 has been openly gay since eighth grade and she intended to communicate a message by wearing a tuxedo and to express her identity through attending prom with a same - sex date , " @entity10 wrote			2
" the court finds this expression and communication of her viewpoint is the type of speech that falls squarely within the purview of the @entity43			0
" when school officials told @entity46 she could neither take her girlfriend to the prom nor wear a tuxedo to the event , the senior went to the @entity50 , which demanded the school change its policy			1
in response , the school district canceled the prom altogether			1
@entity10 denied a motion for an injunction filed by @entity46 against the school district 's superintendent , the school 's principal and its assistant principal asking the court to order that the april 2 prom be reinstated , saying that parents were planning a private event to be held on that date for all students , including @entity46			1
requiring school officials " to step back into a sponsorship role at this late date would only confuse and confound the community on the issue , " he said			0
read the judge 's opinion ( @entity76 ) both sides in the dispute were happy with the outcome			0
" it vindicates @entity86 's rights , " said @entity80 , senior counsel with the @entity50 's lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender project			2
" it sets a legal precedent for gay and lesbian students all over the country that they have the right to bring a same - sex date to the prom and also to wear gender - nonconforming clothes to the prom			2
we were looking for a ruling that what the school did was violate her rights , " @entity97 said			0
school board attorney @entity103 said the school district was also pleased with the decision			1
she said the parent - sponsored event , which may be called a ball instead of a prom , is to be held in @entity110 , 19 miles away			1
but @entity50 's @entity97 said @entity46 had not received an invitation			2
" we have n't heard anything about this private prom other than what this school district has told us , " she said			1
" it remains to be seen whether she will be able to attend the private prom			0
" @entity46 's case is going forward on a damages claim and the @entity50 's request for attorneys ' fees , she said			0
" she got what she wanted , and now it 's just a question of what the damages might be in her case			0
" " i never thought the school would try to cancel the prom and hurt everyone just to keep me and my girlfriend from going together , " @entity46 said last week in an @entity50 news release			1
" a lot of people have made really generous offers to pay for a prom somewhere else , which i really appreciate			0
but all i 've ever wanted was to be able to just go to my own school 's prom with my girlfriend			2
" at the center of the lawsuit is a february 5 memorandum from the school to students that said prom dates must be of the opposite sex			0
superintendent @entity147 also told @entity46 that she and her girlfriend could be ejected from the prom if other students complained about their presence , according to the documents .			0
