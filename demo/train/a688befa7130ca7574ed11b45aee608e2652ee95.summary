@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 authorities arrested 10 people believed to be gay men under a bill signed this week that bans same - sex marriages , a human rights group said			1
police detained men in various states and have dozens of pending arrests based on perceived sexual orientation , according to @entity13			1
" those arrested under this draconian new legislation must be released immediately and the charges against them dropped			2
locking someone up for their sexual orientation violates the most basic human rights standards , " @entity18 , a researcher for the rights group , said in a statement wednesday			2
@entity1 police spokesman @entity25 angrily suggested no one had been arrested due to the new law			1
" i challenge @entity13 to publish details of persons alleged to have been arrested in connection with the new anti-gay law , stating clearly when they were arrested , where they were arrested , the police station or department that carried out the arrest , etc. , " @entity25 told @entity2 thursday			1
" the new anti-gay law is primarily designed to prevent same sex marriages and unions in @entity1			2
so far , ( to the best of our knowledge ) no @entity1 has come out to declare his intention of engaging in such an illicit union			2
therefore , the question that naturally arises is : how can the police arrest ' suspects or offenders ' not known to them or to the law ? " in @entity49 , @entity13 said an assistant commissioner of police confirmed that authorities had placed " a list of suspected gay people " under surveillance			1
the group said police arrested the men in @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity62 states			1
" reports that the police in one state are apparently drawing up lists of members of the lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and intersex community to target are extremely worrying , " @entity18 added			1
@entity25 took issue with that claim as well			2
" who is this assistant commissioner of police ? @entity13 should provide his name and designation			1
without providing details of the sources of their stories , third parties like @entity2 can not independently verify the authenticity or accuracy of such stories			2
the anonymity of the story raises a big credibility question			0
" @entity88 alone has a total of seven assistant commissioners of police			1
there are hundreds of @entity93 nationwide			0
thus , without properly identifying the @entity93 in question , i will treat the story as mere fiction			1
" president @entity98 signed the bill monday after parliament passed it last year , despite international pressure against it			0
it bans same - sex marriages and civil unions , and includes sentences of up to 14 years in prison for gay couples			0
the bill also forbids the operation of gay clubs , societies or meetings in @entity1			0
the punishment for such acts is 10 years in prison			0
@entity118 secretary of state @entity117 joined the @entity119 in condemning the bill			0
" this law dangerously restricts freedom of assembly , association and expression for all @entity1 , " @entity117 said			0
" people everywhere deserve to live in freedom and equality			1
no one should face violence or discrimination for who they are or who they love			0
" @entity119 chief @entity135 expressed concerns , saying he was alarmed by reports of arrests and torture			1
he said he fears the bill will lead to violence and discrimination			0
. last month , the @entity143 parliament passed controversial legislation that would make some gay acts punishable by life in prison			0
president @entity148 has not signed it yet			0
homosexuality is illegal in most @entity152 nations based on remnants of sodomy laws introduced during the @entity156 colonial era			1
the laws are perpetuated by cultural and religious beliefs			0
punishments across the continent range from fines to years in prison			0
last year , a @entity165 report found @entity152 and @entity167 nations are the least accepting of homosexuality			1
of the 39 countries surveyed , @entity1 was the most intolerant			0
at least 98 % of respondents in the nation said homosexuality is unacceptable			1
@entity2 's @entity173 reported from @entity0 , and @entity174 from @entity175			0
@entity2 's @entity176 contributed to this report .			2

new : @entity180 spokesman denies arrests , denounces @entity13 report as fiction
police also *compile* a list of people for surveillance
at least 98 % of respondents in the nation say homosexuality is unacceptable
homosexuality is illegal in most @entity152 nations
