the appearance was n't for a singing engagement or a @entity27 signing			2
this was a dream being fulfilled , a symbol of her own struggles as a child and a young woman			2
it was the official ribbon - cutting for the @entity36			0
the building has no sign yet , but its pastel - painted rooms will soon become a haven for women and young girls , offering them different programs for education , life skills , self - empowerment and much more if @entity2 has her way			1

after local officials spoke , @entity2 stepped up			1
" when i was 5 years old there was a lot that happened to me ... that i carry ... all my life			2
" her voice filled with emotion			0
people in the crowd started to yell in support			0
" do n't cry ! " " it 's ok , @entity2 ! " " we love you ! " @entity2 removed her sunglasses to wipe away her tears			1
" and when ... i was growing up after that , i saw so many women beaten to death , almost to their death , by men			2
" @entity1 spoke with @entity2 at the center			1
she talked about her personal struggles as a young woman , how her spirit helped her rise above thoughts of suicide and her plans to help women now			1
the following is an edited version of the interview			0
@entity1 : i feel like you can really help young women			2
do you feel that way ? @entity2 : i always felt that i wanted to help women , period			1
as a child i [ saw ] women really , really suffer terrible , terrible situations , and i vowed as a child to want to do something -- anything -- that can help them have better self - esteem so that they do n't have to be subjected to men that wanted to kill them			1
in my music , that 's what i 've been doing in my career , and now through @entity48 i 'm doing that			2
@entity1 : today was touching , especially seeing you break down and talk about your life			0
was it difficult to go to that place ? @entity2 : well , today was very , very heavy			1
it was happy and sad because you know the very place where i 've seen so many women suffer is the sad part , and the very place that i suffered is the sad part			0
but the happy part is i 'm back to help			0
i 'm back doing what i dreamed to do			0
my dream is coming true			1
@entity1 : will all age ranges be able to come here and seek guidance ? @entity2 : all age ranges will be able to come to this center			1
women from all walks of life , not just women from poverty - stricken areas			1
... whatever it is , they 'll be able to come here			0
there are gon na be psychologists here , doctors here , day care centers here			0
anything that you need or they need to be able to better themselves is here for them			0
@entity1 : what got you through when you were young ? @entity2 : i guess what got me through when i was young was something i guess a lot of people do n't have and that was just the will			1
... i do n't know what was driving me			0
i guess it was something in me did want to die -- you know , i guess my spirit did n't want to die , but my physical body definitely was at some point was like i got ta get out of here			1
... my physical body was contemplating suicide and all this other crazy stuff , and my spirit is what saved me , i believe			1
@entity1 : do you think there are enough resources out there for women ? @entity2 : i think there 's definitely enough resources , but ... a lot of women are ashamed to come forth			1
what i believe i 've done for women is show them , look , i 'm @entity2 and i 'm telling you you do n't have to be ashamed			1
... that 's why i think as celebrities we 're given this job			0
we 're not given this job to just hold onto this stuff and die with it			0
we 're given this job to be able to touch someone and say , " me , too , " because they look up to us and look to us for help and guidance and want to be able to relate to us			0
@entity1 : when you reached adulthood what set you free ? @entity2 : the truth was ... i had to admit that i needed help and i needed help in self - love and finding myself			2
and i had to admit that although i was ashamed that i did n't know who i was			0
... @entity1 : will you be up here and have time in your schedule to come to the center ? @entity2 : i will definitely be up here			1
i mean before this building had this much in it i was here with the girls			0
... i would come and talk to them , i 'd give them things , i sent them clothes			0
i 'd get their letters , i 'd send them letters back			0
i 'm definitely gon na be here			0
@entity1 : have you had a sigh of relief that it has all come to fruition ? @entity2 : i am so happy today is the day , ya know ? we cut the ribbon .			2
