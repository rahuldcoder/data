-- after five and a half weeks in transit limbo , @entity2 leaker @entity1 was granted temporary one - year asylum in @entity5 on thursday			1
the @entity6 expressed " disappointment " and again raised the threat of possibly canceling the meeting between president @entity9 and president @entity10 next month when the @entity12 president is scheduled to travel to @entity5 for the @entity14 meeting in @entity15			1
but just how disappointed should @entity17 be with this development ? with @entity1 being allowed to leave the transit area , the move can provide an opportunity for @entity12 authorities to make contact with him somewhere in @entity24			0
it is my understanding that while @entity1 has been in the transit area , it has not been possible for @entity12 authorities to make contact with him , and this has been a real problem for @entity17			0
perhaps if @entity1 had a clearer idea of what precisely his fate would be upon return to the @entity12 , he might reconsider			0
that was certainly the purpose of attorney general @entity40 's letter to the @entity5 last week			0
@entity10 has made clear several times that his preferred option is for @entity1 to leave @entity5 as soon as possible , and i am inclined to believe him			1
my hope for the past few weeks has been that there had been considerable back - channel communication between @entity12 and @entity5 authorities , including most importantly at the @entity9 / @entity10 level , about finding a reasonably acceptable exit strategy from the dilemma			2
@entity5 has already gotten some pr bang from the @entity1 affair , and we have to assume that @entity5 intelligence authorities have copied all materials that @entity1 brought with him as well as whatever else he knows about sources and methods , intelligence personnel , internal operations , etc. it is hard to imagine that @entity5 special services have not had extensive conversations with him and likely this cooperation was an important factor in consideration of his asylum request			0
but staying in @entity5 longer only gratuitously inflames an already very shaky and vulnerable @entity12 - @entity5 relationship that i do not believe @entity10 seeks to further damage , at least not because of @entity1			1
@entity10 has made clear that he will not extradite @entity1 to the @entity12 , and we should take him at his word on that			2
however , if @entity1 himself decided that he preferred to return to the @entity12 , then the @entity5 would be obliged , and perhaps happy , to let him go			2
perhaps @entity1 should heed the excellent story by @entity74 in the @entity75 on july 19 about the predominantly sad fates of @entity12 citizens who have received asylum in the @entity79 and @entity5			1
there is no way the @entity83 agent @entity10 , who fundamentally despises and disrespects traitors and revealers of state secrets , will allow @entity1 much running room in @entity5			2
@entity10 does not really like public discussions of state surveillance of citizens , even if they are @entity12 citizens , and when he states the condition of staying in @entity5 that @entity1 stop harming the @entity12 , he probably means he wants an end to public revelations of further documents @entity1 claims to have			1
and if @entity1 were to pursue his so - called human rights activities in @entity5 , he would meet a very unhappy fate indeed			1
like many of his asylum - seeking brethren in the past , he may find his life so restricted that he turns to drink or some worse self - destructive fate			0
so @entity1 should not only be clear about what his likely fate would be in returning to the @entity12 , but he should also be clearly briefed by our @entity5 friends about how he will actually be treated upon receiving asylum in @entity5 if that were to happen			1
finally , having received and accepted for now asylum in @entity5 , this is the second - best outcome for @entity12 security interests after @entity1 himself possibly deciding to return to @entity12 , something he still could potentially do			1
since we have to assume that the @entity112 and the @entity5 already have taken all the information that he had to offer , the @entity12 should have no interest in seeing @entity1 going off to other countries and even more widely distributing his secrets			2
probably @entity10 himself would not like to see this happen either since it would diminish the value of the intelligence that @entity5 has received from @entity1			0
despite the developments thursday , @entity10 might also see that the best outcome is for @entity1 to decide for himself that he should return to the @entity12			0
i have to think that our @entity5 friends can be very persuasive in making this argument , and i hope that @entity9 and his team are pursuing this more subtle and face - saving solution			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity130 .			0

@entity1 was granted temporary asylum in @entity5
@entity134 says *people* should not be quick to label it a *defeat* for @entity12
he says @entity10 would likely want @entity1 to leave @entity5 *voluntarily*
@entity130 : @entity1 should *reflect* on unhappy fate of asylum seekers in @entity5
