@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 will submit a letter to the @entity0 @entity5 friday requesting formal @entity0 recognition of @entity3 statehood , according to a top @entity3 official			1
@entity2 met wednesday with @entity0 @entity10 ban ki - moon , who promised that the request will be taken " very seriously , " dr. @entity9 told reporters on hand for the 66th session of the @entity15 -- a session dominated concerns over the intractable @entity18 - @entity3 @entity10 said it will " not take long " to get @entity5 consideration , @entity9 said			1
@entity2 will give " some time " to the @entity5 before trying to negotiate statehood via the @entity15 , @entity9 said			1
" we do not think of this as a tactic or as a bluff , " he stressed			0
" this is really a moment of truth			0
" @entity9 said that settling for a lesser status at the @entity0 -- such as becoming a non-state member -- is one option under consideration if the push for statehood is ultimately blocked			2
but the @entity3 do not want " anybody to suspect a lack of seriousness , " he said			1
vehemently opposes @entity0 recognition of a @entity3 state , arguing that such a development would derail an already fragile @entity42 peace process			1
news of @entity2 ' plan came shortly after @entity46 president @entity45 told members of the @entity15 that he shares their frustration with the apparent inability to find a resolution to the decades - old conflict			1
@entity45 resisted calls for formal @entity0 recognition of an independent @entity3 state , however , asserting that " peace will not come through statements and resolutions at the @entity0 " @entity45 has been trying to mend political fences with wary backers of @entity18 at home while avoiding the diplomatic fallout that would accompany a @entity46 veto of a @entity5 measure endorsing recognition of a @entity3 state			1
" i know that many are frustrated by the lack of progress , " @entity45 told members of the @entity15			1
" so am i. but the question is n't the goal we seek -- the question is how to reach it			2
and i am convinced that there is no shortcut to the end of a conflict that has endured for decades			0
" " one year ago , i stood at this podium and called for an independent @entity79 , " @entity45 noted			2
" i believed then -- and i believe now -- that the @entity3 people deserve a state of their own			2
but what i also said is that genuine peace can only be realized between @entity18 and @entity3 themselves			1
" he said that a year later , despite extensive @entity46 efforts , " the parties have not bridged their differences			0
" " faced with this stalemate , i put forward a new basis for negotiations in may			0
that basis is clear , and well - known to all of us here			0
@entity18 must know that any agreement provides assurances for their security			2
@entity3 deserve to know the territorial basis of their state			2
" later , @entity45 met with @entity37 and declared that " the bonds between the @entity46 and @entity18 are unbreakable			1
" @entity37 called @entity46 opposition to immediate @entity0 recognition of @entity3 statehood a " badge of honor			1
" @entity45 told @entity103 prime minister @entity102 in talks on tuesday that the @entity3 effort would not advance a " shared goal " of resolving the decades - old @entity18 - @entity3 conflict , according to @entity108 , a top @entity109 aide			1
@entity45 also urged @entity102 to continue work toward patching up @entity103 's strained relations with @entity18 , @entity111 - @entity110 said			1
among other things , @entity45 also used his address to the @entity15 wednesday to tackle a range of issues relating to the so - called @entity118 , celebrating the toppling of autocratic rulers in @entity121 , @entity122 , and @entity123 , while expressing support for reform movements in @entity126 , @entity127 , and elsewhere			1
the president also sought to rally international support for @entity131 famine relief , and provided backing for both @entity133 economic efforts and international measures to combat climate change			0
for the world in general , @entity45 declared , " the tide of war is receding			2
" the @entity46 leader asserted that the belief that change could come through violence died with @entity145 leader @entity144 's demise			0
" this has been a difficult decade , " he said			0
" but today , we stand at a crossroads of history with the chance to move decisively in the direction of peace			2
" the @entity45 administration is seeking this week to reinforce a foreign policy strategy that emphasizes cooperation and shared responsibility after what has been criticized as a " might makes right " posture by the @entity46 in past decades			1
the administration " has dramatically changed @entity46 's course at the @entity0 to advance our interests and values and help forge a more secure and prosperous world , " declared a @entity161 document released tuesday			0
" we have repaired frayed relations with countries around the world			0
we have ended needless @entity46 isolation on a range of issues			0
and as a consequence , we have gotten strong cooperation on things that matter most to our national security interest			0
" the document cited " concrete results " at the @entity0 that it said advanced " @entity46 foreign policy objectives and @entity46 security , " including : -- the stiffest @entity0 sanctions ever against @entity181 and @entity182 ; -- efforts to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons and materials ; -- the @entity122 intervention and subsequent efforts to aid the political transition there ; -- the peaceful independence of @entity192 ; and , -- @entity0 assistance in @entity194 and @entity195			0
in addition , the @entity161 document said the @entity46 is the largest donor of humanitarian assistance for the @entity201 famine , with most of the $ 600 million provided so far funneled through @entity0 agencies			0
@entity1 's @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , and @entity207 contributed to this report			0
