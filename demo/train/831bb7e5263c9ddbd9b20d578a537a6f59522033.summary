-- the @entity1 is not just angering travelers at airports			1
the @entity1 also does buses , trucks , subways and trains			1
guess what ? the none - too - popular agency appears to have had the same kind of unimpressive performance issues on the rails as it has in the aviation industry			0
since 2005 , the @entity1 's @entity15 teams have been spot - checking for terrorism threats in the nation 's massive network of highways and rail systems -- a seemingly overwhelming task			1
by many reliable accounts , @entity15 began life as a modern version of the @entity25			1
now , more than six years later , there 's still a lot of room for improvement			0
considering the blunders at the beginning , vipr teams are greatly improved today , and probably already are better than their airport counterparts			2
but considering the @entity1 's record of passenger treatment -- and its level of popularity -- among air travelers , of course , that is not high praise			1
the possibility that the @entity1 would disband vipr is remote			1
perhaps the best solution is to have @entity43 and the railroads continue what they 've been doing : training vipr teams , keeping them under control and letting them know there will be trouble if they do anything dumb			1
a great deal of credit for @entity15 improvement should go to @entity43 's police chief , @entity55 , who was so outraged about an incident in @entity57 , @entity58 , in february 2011 that he angrily threw vipr teams off @entity43 property until they learned how not to make fools of themselves			1
" when i saw it , i did n't believe it was real , " @entity55 said of a posting on an @entity64 blog site			0
when he learned it was not a joke , " i hit the ceiling , " he said			0
@entity1 rail , subway spot - checks raise privacy issues what happened in @entity57 ? a @entity15 team became far too visible			1
for reasons that have never been publicly explained , a squad of @entity15 agents showed up at a @entity57 @entity43 station one day and literally took over without the knowledge or approval of the @entity81			1
everyone who entered the station was thoroughly searched			0
it did n't seem to matter whether people were getting on trains or getting off trains , or just looking for a place to go to the bathroom			2
the " rules , " if there were any , seemed to be that if you entered the station , you went through a full search			0
if you walked around the station to get to a train or to get off a train -- quite an easy thing to do at the @entity57 station -- no one bothered you			2
clearly , no security issue was involved			0
the @entity1 apologized repeatedly to the chief and promised never to do it again , but the version of the incident on its website was more arrogant than apologetic			1
@entity55 said apologies were irrelevant and the @entity1 website version was filled with inaccuracies			1
the @entity1 must promise to never go beyond the policies of the @entity81 , he said , and to be certain that @entity43 police are present whenever vipr teams take any action on @entity43 property or trains			1
the embarrassed @entity1 readily agreed to every requirement			1
@entity43 's policies are quite specific : @entity43 police ( and therefore vipr ) do most of their security behind the scenes			1
they do a lot , which i have agreed to keep off the record			0
that 's too bad , because some of their methods are fascinating			0
occasionally , however , @entity43 will go public and set up a table at a boarding gate for one train			1
perhaps one in nine passengers will be quickly pulled aside			0
their luggage will be swabbed for explosives			0
they are never personally searched or put through any other kind of screening			0
and @entity55 's rules say passengers are always to be treated with courtesy			0
if passengers refuse the search , an @entity43 police officer is to courteously take them to the ticket counter and be certain they get a full refund			1
meanwhile , over at the yards , freight railroads were having their own problems with the vipr teams			0
the @entity1 demanded that @entity15 agents be allowed to enter yards at any hour of the day or night without notice and to watch employees from hidden positions			1
the railroads told the @entity1 to go to hell			2
yards are dangerous places for amateurs , they said			0
it is easy to lose a leg or be crushed between couplers , not to mention that many yard employees unofficially carry guns to kill rats , and they could kill a rat in the weeds that turned out to be a human being			0
again , the @entity1 had no choice			2
it is not well known , but the @entity1 must have permission to go onto private property			2
that makes no difference at airports because the @entity1 must approve any new airport security arrangements if the agency is ordered to leave			2
the @entity1 has made it known that it will immediately move its equipment out of any airport that tells it to leave , and it will take weeks or months to approve any new security arrangements and equipment			1
at railroads , however , all the security equipment is owned by the railroads			0
why did the railroads even put up with the @entity1 ? as one top railroad official put it , " keep your friends close and your enemies closer			1
" as for the @entity1 's side of the story , it usually does n't comment publicly on general criticism of @entity15			1
but @entity1 officials often do react to with specific incidents			2
for instance , when there were widespread reports that @entity15 agents were pulling over trucks and searching trucks in @entity200 , a @entity1 spokesman said @entity15 was only passing out informational brochures at truck stops for one day			1
reporters confirmed that was correct			0
but the funniest thing happened to @entity15 teams , according to railroad officials			1
they became fascinated with railroads even though most of them had come out of aviation security , and they follow the rules			0
@entity55 says he is pleased with their progress			0
freight railroad officials also were surprised and pleased			0
one top freight rail security official , who did not want to be named , said many of the @entity15 members have become rail fans and show a growing fascination with railroads			2
a major question remains : are such searches constitutional under the @entity227 ? the courts have allowed the @entity1 to operate in airports because the threat has been judged to be sufficiently serious			2
but is the threat sufficient on railroads to allow warrantless searches of people who have stirred no obvious suspicions ? that case has yet to be heard			0
follow @ @entity237 on @entity238			0
join the conversation on @entity240			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity243 .			2

the @entity1 has special teams to *protect* trains
@entity15 teams , which started in 2005 , have made mistakes , @entity243 says
@entity243 : @entity43 should train and closely *monitor* @entity15 railroad teams
