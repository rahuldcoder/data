-- " twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you did n't do than by the ones you did do			0
so throw off the bowlines			0
sail away from the safe harbor			0
catch the trade winds in your sails			0
" -- @entity8 @entity10 mountaineer @entity9 , whose expeditions have inspired others to seek adventure adventure comes to those who seek it			1
some are born with an adventurous streak , an insatiable curiosity that can only be quelled through discovery , while others seek out adventures as a means of conquering the demons within : fear , boredom , stagnation , a sort of dry rot of the soul			1
we see adventurous people as being somehow different from ourselves : stronger , braver , tougher , fitter			0
they are versions of our best selves : the doers in life , the fearless , those who go over the mountain and come back to tell us what 's on the other side			0
while we may think the true adventurers are a species apart , we are all adventurers at heart -- yet sometimes the urge is stifled by modern life			1
the lust for adventure is planted in childhood			1
how many of us sat enthralled under the blankets as our parents read us the adventures of the @entity52 , " @entity53 , " " @entity54 , " " @entity55 , " " @entity56 " and " @entity57 " ? children weaned on such stories may be forgiven for assuming adulthood is one long adventure that swings wildly between jungles , swamps , deserted islands and alpine heights			1
yet modern life is increasingly sedentary and safety - conscious			0
the desire for comfort and convenience ameliorates our contradictory urge to explore			0
a few have it thrust upon them : stranded in an inhospitable place , lost in a jungle or called up for combat -- and they find themselves dropped in an adventure that they may not have chosen ; but for the main part , adventure comes to those who seek it			1
dr. @entity80 , a senior lecturer in psychology at @entity82 , says seeking adventure is more common " amongst people who are extroverted , who are outgoing , who are sociable , because one of the things they need -- apart from the excitement of people -- is excitement generally			1
" but if you think adventure is something that only happens to other people ; that you are too unfit to climb a mountain , too scared to sail across the open sea , too nervous to travel through a country where you ca n't speak the language ; perhaps you should rethink			1
after all , having an adventure could be good for you			1
psychologists have linked adventure - seeking with a range of positive qualities			1
adventure can : following the stories of this age 's greatest adventurers such as polar explorer @entity104 , @entity107 climber @entity106 and mountaineer @entity9 , we are encouraged not just to follow their paths up mountains or along rock faces -- they also inspire us to take more risks , to seize more from each day			1
who could fail to be inspired after watching @entity0 interview the world 's greatest living mountaineer , @entity9 ? in 1980 , @entity9 was the first person to ascend @entity107 alone without supplementary oxygen			1
later , he crossed @entity118 on skis			0
he tells @entity0 anchor @entity120 : " i 'm a normal person , a totally normal person , and i was really lucky in my life to have to have the opportunity to follow my dreams			0
so in the beginning i was a rock climber , and all my enthusiasm , my energy and my willpower went into rock climbing			0
" many young people are naturally adventurous -- throwing their energy and enthusiasm behind sport , hobbies and travel			0
witness the explosion of school leavers taking gap years ( a year off in between school and university or the workforce ) , with the destinations becoming more and more exotic and activities accompanying the travel designed to expand their mind as well as their horizons			0
but later in life , we can wake up and find our lives leeched of adventure			1
we may be loaded down with a mortgage , kids or a demanding job			1
adventure then becomes something we prefer to read about rather than live			1
we fall into the trap of the armchair traveler and become transfixed by all the journeys we did n't make			0
instead of setting out on our own expeditions , we read @entity163 's account of his near - death mountaineering experiences in " touching the void			0
" or we follow @entity167 's account of wild sea adventures in " @entity169			1
" but while we are great armchair adventurers , a craving for the real thing can stir in us when we feel the need to change and shake things up			2
women in their 40s are leading the charge towards adventure			1
a survey released by the @entity179 in march 2007 said today 's typical adventure traveler was " female and fortyish			2
" " women make up the majority of adventure travelers ( 52 percent ) worldwide , with the most common destination being @entity185 , " said the trade association			1
the survey of travelers from 35 countries also found that people aged 41 to 60 are the highest participating age group in adventure travel			2
a survey by @entity193 in the @entity194 has identified a new subset of @entity194 -- the @entity196			1
they 've had the responsible jobs and raised their children -- and now they want adventure			2
@entity201 has noticed : " they 've decided to take the five star version of the student gap year , encompassing all of the adventure with none of the discomforts			2
neither burgeoning waistlines nor graying hair is going to hold them back			0
" some older people are inspired to seek adventure by their children 's gap year experiences			1
others just want to spend their kids ' inheritances			2
in a survey of older people carried out by @entity201 they compiled the @entity220 wish list			0
adventure is a common component to their aspirations , the most popular of which are noted below : @entity225 , one of the founders of guidebook giant " @entity228 , " is now an aging baby - boomer , yet he still pops up in @entity230 , a place that has recently dominated headlines the world over for all the wrong reasons			2
in a recent piece in @entity194 newspaper @entity236 , he also recommends holidays in @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240			0
@entity9 now is 63 years old and although he no longer has the strength of his youth , he is still setting himself challenges			1
" so my challenge today is this one ( setting up a museum ) , i will finish this one and afterwards i will invent a new challenge and it will be not on @entity107 and not in @entity118 it will be probably in a mental dimension because mentally we can go very far also in later years , " he told @entity0			0
but the yearning for adventure can strike at all ages			2
@entity254 , 33 , and @entity255 , 28 , both gave up exciting jobs in the @entity258 media to travel			0
they are spending april and may in @entity230 and have already braved trekking in the @entity259 , train travel across @entity261 , diving in @entity263 and traveling in @entity264			0
" i see adventure as going beyond something you feel comfortable with			2
if you are uncomfortable going to the end of your street and you go beyond this , then you are being adventurous , " said @entity254			0
you do n't have to emulate the deeds of @entity9 to be an adventurer			1
the spirit of adventure can infiltrate all areas of your life			2
you can infuse life 's " ordinariness " with an adventure : cooking a meal that you may not have tried before , walking to work on a different route , striking up conversation with someone at the office whom you perceive to be intimidating			2
successfully pushing your natural boundaries can lead to increased confidence			0
" the general things which determine whether you start being adventurous is your personality and your youth			0
but once you start noticing that you have been able to overcome a challenge , it becomes a reward in its own right , " said dr. @entity80			1
for @entity9 , adventure now takes place on the ground , with establishing a climbing museum and being elected a member of the @entity302			1
speaking to @entity0 with the mighty mountains behind him , there was a restless but playful look in his eyes			0
he said he was n't the type to sit around , drink beer and collect his pension in his old age			0
adventure is so much a part of his life , it seems , that it is an urge that can only be extinguished by death			2
and so while the strength in his body diminishes , the adventures will take place in his mind			2
@entity9 is an extraordinary man , and while most of us would struggle to climb @entity107 with or without oxygen , we can still emulate his spirit of adventure in our daily lives .			1
