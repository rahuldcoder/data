it 's 7 a.m. in @entity1 , the @entity2 , and the church bells are ringing for sunday mass. it 's may 2014 and i 'm accompanying 11 - year - old @entity7 and his parents to the weekly service			1
@entity10 is one of the children i have got to know through my work with children 's charity @entity14			2
when @entity16 wreaked havoc across the @entity2 in november 2013 , i was deployed to support the team			1
@entity7 lives in a coastal village in @entity20 , which was badly destroyed by the tsunami - like waves that followed the storm			1
many of the people attending the church service lost family members and friends , many of whom are now buried in the mass grave outside on the main square			1
when the minister calls for prayers , the air is thick with sorrow			2
there is a common experience that , as an outsider , i can not fully grasp			0
everyone in here has sensed the risk of death			0
they have been so close to the end , but they have survived			0
soon the air fills with a sense of power and energy			0
when the minister cracks a joke , laughter echoes out through the open doors			0
now , having visited the @entity2 three times over the past year ( in november 2013 , and then may and september , 2014 ) , i truly believe the disaster recovery has come this far because of the remarkable resilience and spirit of the @entity2 people			1
@entity61 : before and after , six months on @entity62 to rebuild when i first arrived in @entity64 in november 2013 , just three weeks after the typhoon , all i could see was piles of debris , reminiscent of apocalyptic destruction			1
yet , in the middle of the rubble and burning waste , i could hear the sound of people hammering , already in the process of rebuilding their houses			1
women were washing their clothes and hanging it between the few walls that were left of their homes			1
children were running around in flip - flops looking for scrap metal and old glasses they could sell to help their families get food			2
i even heard people singing			2
a year later and a lot has happened ; @entity7 's school is being rebuilt , he is attending a temporary school , and plays with his friends on the weekend			2
the rubble and fallen trees have been cleared and the vegetation is lush and green			0
shops have reopened and the streets are crowded with cars , bicycles and taxis , while the community is out in full force , selling fruit and sweets			0
children can play freely on the beach and they are finally allowed to go swimming in the sea once again			0
children among most vulnerable @entity10 has grown a great deal since last november			2
now he is a confident , relaxed boy who welcomes me to the house of his great grandmother			0
he says he 's still afraid of storms and bad weather , but the nightmares come more seldom			0
@entity14 's priority is protecting children who are among those worst affected by a disaster , and among the most vulnerable after			0
after @entity16 , @entity14 set up " @entity121 , " providing a safe space for 21,000 children to play , learn and get much - needed emotional support -- while nearly 10,000 parents , children and community members were trained on how to avoid violence , abuse , neglect and exploitation			1
over the past year , @entity14 has helped more than 40,000 children to return to school with its " @entity138 " kits -- including bags , books and pens -- or by rebuilding classrooms , training teachers and supplying school equipment			2
although we 've come a long way from the devastating scenes my colleagues and i witnessed a year ago , work still remains			1
in @entity150 , one of the areas worst hit by @entity16 , @entity14 's " @entity149 " project is working with the government and community members to help residents build a community that 's better able to withstand the next powerful storm			1
as for @entity10 , he now dreams of becoming a scientist and learning more about typhoons and climate change			0
we look out towards the calm ocean and i ask him what it 's like to live in the @entity2 , where a natural disaster never seems too far away			1
@entity10 replies : " this is my favorite place			0
it 's like a freedom , where my family can live and be happy and proud			0
" for me , hearing his words is testament to the resilience of @entity10 , his family and the @entity2 community .			1

spirit of @entity2 remains strong one year after typhoon made *landfall* november 8 , 2013
@entity16 is one of *strongest* *cyclones* ever recorded
more than *6,000* people were *killed* , whole villages swept away by wind , water
storm surges *flooded* low - lying coastal regions , destroying homes and *businesses*
