-- the wait is almost over			0
after months of hype , a reported $ 35 million in marketing costs and one high - profile judge switcheroo , @entity6 's " @entity5 " will finally premiere on wednesday			1
but will it be one talent contest too many ? and can the show possibly be as big a hit in the @entity11 as it is back in the @entity12 ? i 've been eagerly anticipating the @entity11 launch of " @entity15 " for a long time now and have been frequently posting updates on my site @entity17			1
as a reality tv producer , originally from the @entity12 but now living here in the @entity11 , i 'm very familiar with " @entity15 " format and its influence on @entity12 culture			1
for the past eight years , " @entity15 " has been the no. 1 entertainment show in @entity12 television , launching the career of several @entity12 pop stars and one international singing sensation , @entity29			2
so can lightning strike twice ? in case you 're not too familiar with " @entity15 " back story , here 's a quick refresher			2
over in @entity38 in 2001 , the @entity37 network unleashed a new talent contest called " @entity40			0
" the show became an instant smash , due in large part to its toughest judge , @entity6 , and an addictive elimination format			1
in 2002 , " @entity40 " relocated to the @entity11 as " @entity46			2
" that show became an even bigger hit , launching stars like @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 and making @entity6 one of the richest people in show business			2
now here 's where it gets really interesting			0
" @entity11 " @entity40 was overseen by @entity60 guru @entity59 , leaving @entity6 as a mere ( highly paid ) gun - for - hire with no stake in the show -- or the success of its artists			2
as vocal as @entity6 has been about being competitive , it is not surprising that he wanted to run his own show and reap the subsequent rewards			2
so back in @entity38 , " @entity40 " was canceled after two seasons and replaced by the @entity6 - produced " @entity5 , " resulting in some bad blood between the two @entity70 and a high - profile lawsuit ( eventually settled )			1
the format of " @entity15 " is similar to " idol , " but there are several key differences			1
on " @entity15 , " each of the four judges ' mentor ' a category of contestant : males younger than 30 ; females younger than 30 ; groups ; and 30s and older			2
the show therefore becomes a contest between the judges as much as the contestants , often resulting in plenty of judges ' bickering ( " @entity5 " judges @entity92 and @entity93 were reportedly barely on speaking terms by the end of their run on the show )			1
at the same time , the diversity of the contestants also makes the show rather different from " idol , " which these days only seems to crown white male guitar players			2
one other key difference is that " @entity15 " is big ! auditions take place in front of a live audience , rather than a tiny audition room			0
and as the show progresses , it 's the job of the judges to produce each of the contestants ' performances as though they were staging an awards show style performance			1
so " @entity5 " finalists get dancers , elaborate sets and complex lighting arrangements in contrast to the " static stand - and - sing " style of " @entity46			1
" those are the differences			0
but can " @entity15 " succeed in the fiercely competitive @entity11 marketplace ? back in @entity38 , the show faced little competition in the music competition genre			2
the @entity128 had " @entity136 " ( for which i produced all the live performance shows ) and @entity37 had " @entity131 " ( a version of which also ran for two seasons here in the @entity11 ) , but both shows had effectively run out of steam by the time " @entity15 " launched			0
by contrast , the @entity11 version of " @entity15 " is entering a crowded market dominated by a decade of the very successful " @entity46			1
" then there 's @entity142 upstart " @entity143 , " which came out of nowhere in the spring to achieve strong ratings , especially among the highly coveted 18 - 49 demo			0
and at the same time as " @entity15 , " @entity142 will also be rolling out a new season of another singing competition , " @entity148			0
" and those are just the success stories			0
over the last few years countless music competition series have come and go			0
remember " @entity151 , " " @entity152 , " " @entity153 , " " @entity154 " and @entity156 's " @entity155 ? " exactly ! even this year we 've seen the heavily hyped " @entity160 " struggle on @entity159 , while @entity163 's " @entity162 " was an outright flop			0
can " @entity5 " buck the trend and become a bona fide phenomenon ? in large part , the success of " @entity15 " will depend on whether it can discover a true international superstar			1
even @entity6 has admitted this will be the benchmark of the show 's success			1
unfortunately this will also be the show 's toughest challenge			1
it 's been a long time since " idol " discovered a true star			0
not since @entity181 's @entity180 has an " idol " artist sold a million albums ( though season 8 runner - up @entity185 has done reasonably well ) , and season 10 winner @entity188 seems unlikely to buck the trend			0
and while " @entity143 's " @entity192 has received plenty of critical kudos , " @entity143 " finale was actually one of the lower - rated episodes of the season			0
it could be argued that the public appetite for music competition pop stars has already been sated			0
another challenge for " @entity15 " is that " @entity143 " has effectively stolen one of the key gimmicks of the @entity6 series -- the idea of judges as ' mentors ' who work with their contestants and are in a competition with one another			1
even more damaging is that " @entity143 's " starry line up -- @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 -- is a heck of a lot more contemporary , successful and a-list then " @entity5 " judges @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222			1
but " @entity15 " has one undeniable ace in its hand -- cowell himself			0
after a pitiful season of " idol " in which @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 could barely utter a word of criticism to any of the contestants , it will be refreshing to once again hear @entity6 's sharp - tongued but truthful feedback			1
on this year 's " idol , " everyone was ' amazing ' , resulting in a tedious series that eliminated strong contenders such as @entity240 far too early and neutered others such as @entity242 who needed some harsh truth telling to raise their game			0
personally i think " @entity15 " will be a huge hit for @entity247 , enabling the network to dominate the fall season in much the same way it does the second half of the tv season			0
with all the hype and hoopla surrounding @entity6 's new show , audience awareness is higher than for any other show this season			1
the only remaining question is just how big will " @entity15 " be ? can it possibly beat the 20 million plus audience " idol " still routinely clocks up ? or will it have to settle for the more modest 12 million to 14 million " @entity143 " pulled in ? knowing @entity6 , nothing less than no. 1 will be good enough			1
but for now it 's up for us the audience to decide .			0

@entity6 's " @entity5 " will finally premiere on wednesday
the format of " @entity15 " is similar to " @entity46 "
the show becomes a contest between the judges as much as the contestants
@entity6 himself is likely to be the show 's biggest draw
