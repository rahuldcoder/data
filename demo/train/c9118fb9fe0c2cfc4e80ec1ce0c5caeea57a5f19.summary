stop me if you 've heard this one before			0
a tv series based on a comic book series premieres friday			1
there have been a lot of them lately , from " @entity11 " to " @entity7 " ( and of course the ratings juggernaut " @entity10 " )			0
they 've done quite well this season : both " @entity11 " and " @entity15 " received full - season pickups			1
@entity17 's new offering , " @entity18 , " is a riskier proposition			1
it 's based on the story of cult character @entity18 , the chain - smoking exorcist antihero from the " @entity23 " comic books			1
@entity24 played him in a 2005 film version , which got a lukewarm reception			0
even so , the show seems well - suited to @entity17 's friday night horror lineup , following the sleeper hit " @entity31			1
" @entity32 visited the @entity34 set of " @entity18 " and spoke with @entity18 himself , @entity36 , as well as his co-star @entity37 ( who plays one of @entity18 's sidekicks , @entity40 ) , and later spoke to executive producer @entity41			1
the set itself included a cobweb - filled library that serves as @entity18 's base of operations			1
watching a contortionist portray a demon - possessed woman seemed to be just another day at the office here			1
in between scenes , we asked their thoughts on whether the show had what it takes to be another comics - based hit			1
@entity32 : do you think the hardcore fans will enjoy this series ? @entity36 : i think the fans will get a lot out of this series			1
the source material is so amazing			0
we 're really trying to stay true to that			0
we 're transposing it to this medium of television			0
we 're staying true to this character in the comics			1
the fans will hopefully come with us , and new fans will like the show as will			0
@entity41 : the fans are very important to us			0
i 'm fortunate enough to have as my partner @entity79 , who has brought comic books to life in films			2
we are fans of the property ; it 's a property that @entity79 loves and wanted to bring to screen			2
for us , it 's a dream come true			2
it would never occur to us to be anything less than loyal to the fans			0
@entity32 : do you understand why fans would be nervous ? @entity37 : i totally understand that			0
i like to think that we 're stepping up to the plate , at least with this show			0
the greatest compliment we can hope to receive is the blessing of die - hard " @entity23 " fans			1
everyone involved with the show have become relatively big fans of the comic book			1
you keep wanting to read one story then the next and the next			0
i asked the writers , what 's the " bible " for this show ? they said , " it 's the ' @entity23 ' comic			1
" i took great confidence in that			0
@entity36 : a very good friend of mine has his own comic book company , and for years , he 's been telling me about @entity18 being his favorite comic book character and " hellblazer " his favorite book			1
ever since i got the part , he keeps sending me emails : " why do n't you do this storyline or that storyline ? " it 's like i 've got my own personalized fan who 's feeding me all the great things about the character			1
i did n't know that much about it until i delved about the comics , and the more i 'm reading , the more i 'm loving			2
@entity32 : compared with " @entity10 , " for example , how much of the show is directly from the comic ? @entity37 : you 've got 350 issues of a comic book that ran for almost 30 years			1
if we ever needed a storyline , they just go right back to the comic books			2
with some of these episodes we 've been shooting recently , it 's as though these characters walked right off the page			2
hopefully , that resonates with the fans			0
@entity146 : our perceived story arc is based on his first appearance in " @entity150			2
" they were facing this menace called the " rising darkness , " a force trying to create this climate of fear across the world , to enable a large evil to be born into the world			0
that arc from " @entity150 " is exactly what we 're bringing to " @entity18			1
" week to week , we have to find our own stories			0
sometimes they 're from the comics , sometimes not			2
@entity36 : to be honest , i 've tried to absorb the comics and let that influence me			2
you have to stay true to the essence of it , but you have to give it your take as well			0
the most important thing for me was , what is @entity18 about ? it 's just trying to find that and how i connect to that			1
there 's bits of me in there as well and fleshing it out as well			2
@entity146 : it 's a little bit easier for us , since we 're not a show about superheroes , and @entity18 does n't have superpowers			1
in a way , we 're more of a horror show than a comic - book show			1
for us , as a horror show , it might be easier than other straight comic - book adaptations			1
for us , the draw of the show was the character himself			0
@entity18 is a character we have n't seen on television			1
he is n't afraid to thumb his nose at any form of evil			0
he 's just a really fun , inventive character			2
his costume is a trench coat and a skinny tie			0
@entity32 : " @entity23 " was definitely a book for mature audiences			1
what can you get away with at 10 p.m. on a friday on network tv ? @entity146 : we 're always trying to find that balance			2
to @entity17 's credit , more often than not , we 'll turn in a script or a cut of an episode , and @entity17 will say , " take it further ; make it more extreme			0
" they 'll push us to make it darker			0
they understand the way people watch television , at least for this kind of show			0
@entity79 and myself are censoring ourselves with what you can and ca n't do on television , and it 's @entity17 that 's telling us to take it further .			0
