-- a @entity2 - based perfume , cosmetics and jewelry chain is set to become one of the first international luxury retailers to open its doors in previously war - torn areas of @entity10			1
@entity11 , known across the @entity12 for its opulent premises piled high with glass cabinets of designer watches , perfumes , and other mainly @entity18 luxury goods , has unveiled plans to open at least five stores across major cities in @entity10 -- including @entity22 and @entity23 -- over the next three years			1
with the first shop due to begin trading in the first half of 2013 , @entity25 gallery ceo @entity24 says that now is the time to invest in @entity10 's domestic market			1
" we 've been waiting for years for the right conditions , " he said			2
" we 've done extensive assessments and believe that now the country is really moving away from what it was to what it wants to be ... there is great potential			0
" the @entity40 estimates that between 2009 and 2012 , gdp per - capita based on current prices in @entity10 more than doubled , and @entity11 is hedging its bets on the growth of a previously stagnant consumer culture and @entity10 with more disposable income			1
" when companies like ours move into places like @entity10 , it tells the people something which is : ' look guys , you deserve it -- you deserve to feel better about yourself , you deserve to have some of the best products from around the world at your doorstep , ' " @entity24 said			1
" it 's a confidence boost for the people			0
" @entity58 is an accountant earning $ 19,000 a year -- over four times the national average based on @entity40 figures			2
she has lived and worked in @entity22 her whole life and welcomes the prospect of being able to purchase branded cosmetics and perfumes locally			2
the price of bottle of perfume starts at $ 50 dollars and many cosmetics brands familiar in the @entity69 will be easily available for the first time			1
" i 'm an @entity10 woman who can afford and wants to buy the kind of things that very few shops here sell , " she said			1
now 23 , @entity58 was just a young girl before the 2003 @entity77 - led war in @entity10 that toppled @entity78 , but she still recalls that the most basic international brands were then prohibitively difficult to buy			1
" our borders with @entity82 and @entity83 were blocked and there was an international economic blockade , so i remember it was very expensive to buy anything fancy , " she said			2
even now , @entity58 -- who lives at home with her parents -- says that imports are inconvenient and import duties costly			0
as such , she and her friends are looking forward to the sheer convenience of stores like the @entity11 opening in their city			1
" yes there is still a lot of variation in incomes here , and of course i do n't believe that these kind of products will immediately be affordable to everyone			0
but after years of having so little , there is now definitely a feeling of great demand , " she said			2
continued sectarian violence , like the car bombings that killed at least 13 people in northwestern @entity22 over the weekend , as well as stalling government infrastructure programs , mean that a flourishing mainstream consumer culture is still some way off , according to @entity115 , director of operations at @entity116			0
" @entity10 is sitting on one of the world 's largest oil reserves , so there 's no question it has enormous economic potential , " @entity115 said			1
" however , as things stand the infrastructure is not where it needs to be			0
" @entity10 is still struggling just to transport oil from its vast oil fields to the shipping tankers that export it to the rest of world , according to @entity115			1
" it all comes back to oil ... revenue from oil constitutes around 96 % of @entity10 's budget , so the more money they can make from that , the more they can then spend on building roads , reliable electricity supplies and security , " he said			1
" these are the building blocks that make for a stable and attractive business environment			0
" watts say that @entity10 nonetheless has a historic reputation as a good place to do business , the culture of which still remains			1
" despite the last 35 years of instability , @entity10 retain their entrepreneurial instinct			2
they 're great at making deals , diversifying their interests , working hard and solving problems , " he said			0
on the other hand , @entity115 points out that the legacy of the @entity78 era is a heaving , highly bureaucratic state , which makes conducting business slow and difficult			0
" i 've heard of companies who have had equipment held up in customs for eight months , " he said			0
" and getting routine work visas can be a nightmare			0
" @entity24 , however , is undeterred			0
he explains that @entity11 has teamed up with the @entity172 , an @entity10 firm established in 1975 that he says understand the local business environment and will run the stores on a franchise basis			1
" there are always problems setting up a businesses in a new country , no matter how developed it is			0
but there are no difficulties we can see that ca n't be solved , " said @entity24			0
" once we 've shown everyone that it can be done then i would love nothing more than to see other international firms who specialize in shopping and entertainment , moving in and helping make @entity10 a happier place to live			2

luxury jewelry , perfume and cosmetics chain store plans to open number of shops in @entity10
the @entity2 - based @entity11 says that the economic conditions are now right to invest
projected growth of middle class and current unmet demand for luxury brands account for *decision* , says ceo
