@entity0 -- the @entity3 military is updating plans to potentially evacuate @entity3 @entity6 personnel from @entity7 in the wake of rising violence and uncertainty about the security situation in that country , @entity1 has learned			1
any military involvement in an evacuation would come only after the @entity3 ambassador requests help , something which has not yet happened			1
however , this week , defense and @entity19 officials confirmed there have been a series of conversations between the @entity23 and @entity19 about how long @entity3 diplomats can safely stay in @entity7			1
" we are poised to act if it becomes necessary to get people out , " the defense official said			0
" if you ask me do i think it 's more likely now , the answer is yes			2
" a @entity19 official said there is always planning in place , " but no decisions have been made			0
" " the situation could change tomorrow or the next day , so i do n't want to say we never will , but for now it is not in the cards , " the @entity19 official said			0
a @entity3 defense official with direct knowledge of the planning confirmed the details to @entity1 but declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter			1
while the @entity23 has been keeping a close eye on the deteriorating security situation in @entity7 for weeks , several defense officials tell @entity1 that in the last few days , concern has grown			2
@entity51 member killed in @entity7 strike , official says general threats terrorists have made general threats against the @entity6 and personnel in @entity7 , including the ambassador , but the @entity3 does not have any actionable information about a specific or credible threat , @entity19 officials said tuesday			1
last weekend , @entity61 ( @entity61 ) claimed it planted two explosive devices at the residence of @entity7 's president to target @entity3 ambassador @entity65 who was expected there for a meeting , according to an online statement posted by the terror group and unearthed by @entity69			1
the explosives were discovered before detonation			0
but defense and @entity19 officials said they have no indication so far there was an attack truly aimed at the ambassador			2
" there are threats against everybody , " a senior @entity19 official said			0
" the @entity3 embassy , the ambassador , all of our employees			1
but there is nothing actionable			0
" the @entity19 officials described the threats " aspirational in nature , " rather than a specific or credible plan to attack @entity3 facilities or personnel			2
" we get a lot of these threats , " another official said			0
" we look , check and decide whether there is something actionable			0
if there were some time to act upon we would			0
" embassy staff reductions the @entity19 has at times this year ordered a reduction in the number of embassy personnel			0
one @entity19 official said the reduction of staff was " marginal , " with less than a quarter of the personnel sent to other countries in the region until the situation in @entity7 improved			2
the ambassador is still in the country , and several dozen heavily armed @entity114 continue to guard the embassy			0
" there is a lot of turmoil there , so we took a few people out and made adjustments -- but this is nowhere near a major reduction , " the @entity19 official said			0
the major concern for the military is whether the violence has grown to the point that the embassy personnel can not safely stay , and that there may be only limited ways of getting them out of @entity7			1
there have been clashes between rebel groups and @entity7 government forces around the airport in the capital , @entity139			1
contingency plans the updated evacuation plans could include the use of @entity3 @entity114 and helicopters stationed on the amphibious warship @entity145 off the coast of @entity7			1
if an evacuation was ordered , and there was continued fighting around the airport in @entity139 that would make it impossible for diplomats to leave on commercial planes , the @entity114 could be called in , a defense official said			1
the defense officials who spoke with @entity1 acknowledge that as part of the discussions about whether and how long the diplomats can safely remain in @entity7 , there is also internal discussion about the key issue of trying to keep a @entity3 presence even after an evacuation that can continue to work with the @entity7 government and military on fighting @entity61 , the @entity61 affiliate in @entity7			1
if the @entity3 were forced to even temporarily shutter the embassy there , its ability to monitor and conduct counterterrorism efforts would be significantly reduced , one of the defense officials said .			2

@entity51 in @entity171 said it planted devices at @entity7 president 's home
