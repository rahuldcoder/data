@entity0 -- nestled within @entity0 's dense skyscraper jungle , a $ 640,000 property sits among some of the world 's most expensive commercial and residential spaces			1
the price might sound like a steal			0
this @entity10 financial capital has the world 's priciest property , according to @entity13			1
since the start of 2010 , average @entity0 home prices have doubled			1
but the price tag mentioned here is neither for a home nor an office			0
it is for a parking space : a slab of undecorated concrete , stained by black motor oil , about 8 - feet - by - 16 - feet in size			1
price per square foot : nearly $ 5,000			2
@entity27 has owned and used this space for the past ten years			2
described in local media as " the tycoon of parking spaces , " he is effusive when talking about this particular " priceless " gem			2
" i think this is the best car park space i ever had , " said the ceo of @entity34 , a property firm that owns hundreds of residential and commercial spaces across the city			1
" you can go straight to the office and the elevator			0
only 20 steps -- 20 steps ! " the ceo does not own just one $ 640,000 parking space			1
if he were to sell he could bank $ 1.3 million			2
" people do n't mind paying more , " boasted @entity27			0
" but i 'm not eager to sell			0
" and yet that is the reality for @entity0			1
according to the latest @entity48 by @entity49 , the global property services firm , this city has the most exorbitant monthly parking fees in the @entity51			2
@entity0 's monthly median parking rate was $ 744.72 in 2011			1
with less than a dollar 's difference , @entity53 came in as @entity51 's number two			2
the reason for @entity0 's pricey parking rates is rooted in governmental curbs on the city 's residential market , said @entity62 , chief analyst at @entity63 , one of the city 's largest real estate companies			1
many analysts believe @entity0 's property market is a bubble waiting to burst			1
to deflate it slowly , the government has introduced a series of increasingly stringent policies since november 2010			0
these have made it more expensive for investors to buy or flip homes for a quick profit			2
the regulations have produced desired results , said @entity62 , leading to a 31 % fall in home sale transactions over the past 23 months			0
but , as a side effect , the squeeze on residential investors has pushed them into commercial property , like parking spaces , which have no such price curbs yet			2
while homes sale transaction volumes have fallen since november 2010 , trade in parking spaces has risen more than 25 % , @entity62 added			0
the volume of industrial , commercial and retail have surged 16 % as well			0
fast price rises and higher yields on leased parking spaces have attracted more investors to this niche market			1
" if you look at this year 's ( total sales ) number , it 's the highest in the past ten years or so , " @entity62 said			0
" through november of this year , @entity0 had car park transactions totaling $ 751 million			1
in 2010 , it was $ 525 million			0
" this rise marks an increase of 43 % so far this year			0
@entity27 , the parking space tycoon , breaks down rental yields by property category			1
" the lowest yield of all property is ( retail ) shops , maybe less than 2 %			0
the second thing is commercial , which is about 2 % to 2.5 % , and then residential which is about 3 %			0
parking spaces should be about 5 %			0
" hence , some of @entity0 's hottest investment vehicles are where people keep their motorized ones			1
but @entity62 , the property analyst , cautions against casual investment in parking spaces			0
if @entity0 's economy stalls the first thing people will get rid of will be their cars			1
no car means no need for a parking space			1
but a home will always have a use			0
" if you buy a parking space , " said @entity62 , " you ca n't live in it			1
" @entity131 contributed to this report			0
