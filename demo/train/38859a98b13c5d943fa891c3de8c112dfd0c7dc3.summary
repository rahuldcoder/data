-- [ @entity1 , book and movie , are discussed here			0
] fans of @entity6 's original novel may have noticed that @entity8 's adaptation of " @entity9 " made a few changes to the story , although more in terms of what was left out than what was stuck in			1
that 's because any adaptation of a book of this length is going to need a bit of streamlining unless you want to opt for the recent trend of @entity23 mitosis that 's splitting everything up into an infinite series of @entity26			1
@entity8 estimates that about 350 pages had to go in order to get the story down to watchable movie length , and according to screenwriter @entity31 , much of that was in the very beginning			1
' @entity34 ' : peek at male - stripper movie " i think there were probably about a hundred pages setting everything up , " @entity31 tells @entity0 , " in terms of @entity41 and his situation			1
there 's probably another 50 or 60 pages of [ @entity6 ] doing the same thing with @entity46			1
those things obviously had to go			0
" one of the few subplots to get dropped entirely was @entity41 's romantic liaison with @entity50 , one of the more amiable of the clan he is investigating , which the filmmakers skipped for both time and to tone down the emphasis on the protagonist 's philandering			1
" @entity59 had a relationship with her that went on for a lot of pages , " laughs @entity31			2
" i 'm a fan of the book -- i like it very much -- but when i was reading it at a certain point i thought , am i reading shampoo ? is this @entity69 or is this @entity41 ? i did n't drop those things in order to make him more sympathetic			1
it was really just that they were unnecessary to the story			2
" 'm : @entity76 ' is box office champ : $ 26.5m but probably the biggest change that readers will pick up on is in the ending , where two strands of the narrative have been fused into one			0
it 's nothing too major , but when you 're working with a novel as popular as this , everything becomes sacred text			2
" i was n't trying to do something different or trying to fix something , " says @entity31			0
" i just thought it was a good idea			0
when i read the book , i thought , ' why are we going so far afield for this mystery to be resolved ? might it be a little more interesting if it 's solved a little closer to home ? ' that 's all there was to it			2
i kind of felt it was right for the character			0
