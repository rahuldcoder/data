also resonating was a stirring speech by @entity89 and @entity90 , who won best song for " glory			2
" their performance of the song brought the film 's star @entity95 to tears			0
' call your mom ; call your dad ' the best supporting actor @entity0 went to @entity102 of " @entity103			1

" @entity163 " won best foreign language film			0
@entity127 leads with jokes the @entity0 -- the " epicenter of noise and world attention , " as " @entity163 " director @entity165 called them -- wasted no time in poking fun at some of the big issues facing @entity172 : diversity , economics and self - involvement			1
@entity127 led off the show with a joke about the lack of diversity among the acting nominees			0
" this year we honor @entity172 's best and whitest -- sorry , brightest , " he joked			0
then , in a mammoth opening number , he and @entity181 were joined by @entity183 , who angrily hopped on stage to throw a sarcastic wet blanket over their hailing of " @entity188 , " noting that the business is as much about " raising tents with tentpoles and chasing @entity193 bucks " than it is about art. he was summarily dismissed by @entity195			0
the host also wandered into the audience , greeting two seat fillers among the celebrities , and at one point parodied " birdman " by walking through the backstage area in his underwear -- right onto the stage			2
# @entity206 some unexpected rain did n't dampen the spirits of the celebrities arriving for @entity172 's biggest night			0

@entity224 : live @entity0 blog ! @entity69 decided to split the difference between black and white , with her gown consisting of a white top and black skirt			1
so did comedian @entity230 , who was wearing a tuxedo featuring a white jacket with black lapels , along with a black shirt , black tie and white pants			0
" when you 're on the red carpet , you might as well pop , " he told @entity4			0
however , the @entity240 hashtag # @entity206 was encouraging interviewers to ask celebrities more than just " who are you wearing ? " one wonders what the late @entity244 would have thought of that			0
rivers was also trending , however , for being left out of the " @entity249 " montage			0
