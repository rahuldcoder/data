@entity3 president @entity1 's administration admitted it erred by failing to send a higher - ranking representative of the @entity5 to the @entity7 unity march on sunday			1
" i think it 's fair to say that we should have sent someone with a higher profile to be there , " @entity9 press secretary @entity8 said monday afternoon			1
he said @entity1 himself would have liked to attend the march " had the circumstances been a little different			2
" but planning began friday night , 36 hours before the event began , and there was n't enough time for the " onerous and significant " security work that needed to take place ahead of a presidential visit , @entity8 said			0
he said @entity1 's presence also would have meant extra restrictions on the people who were there			2
" that said , there is no doubt that the @entity5 people and this administration stand foursquare behind our allies in @entity35 as they face down this threat , " he said			1
" and that was evident throughout last week			0
" more than 40 world leaders , including the @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 heads of state and @entity44 's foreign minister , joined at least 1.5 million people on the @entity7 streets sunday for a unity march that became @entity35 's biggest - ever public demonstration			1
but @entity1 and his administration 's top hands were nowhere to be found -- an absence that triggered complaints that he missed a key leadership opportunity			0
the @entity5 appeared to have options to send to the march : @entity1 spent sunday at the @entity9 with no public events on his schedule			1
vice president @entity58 was at home in @entity60 for the weekend , also with a blank public schedule			0
outgoing attorney general @entity62 was already in @entity7 for security meetings -- and even recorded interviews with several @entity5 sunday morning programs -- but he did n't attend the march			1
a @entity68 official said the agency was not asked to draw up security plans for a potential presidential trip to @entity7 in advance of sunday 's march			1
" we were n't asked or notified about a trip , " the official said			0
but the agency had secret service agents on the ground in @entity7 , per its standard operating procedure			2
" it would have been a challenging advance ... based on what we know , " @entity68 spokesman @entity80 said			0
but @entity80 did not say that such an advance would have been impossible			0
during the @entity9 briefing , @entity8 suggested security challenges were a factor in not having the president travel to @entity7			1
but @entity8 acknowledged the @entity68 could have pulled it off			0
an agency official noted previous " last minute " presidential trips have happened during the @entity1 presidency , including a hurried visit to @entity95 in december 2013 for the memorial service for @entity97			2
the @entity9 noted that it was represented in @entity7 on sunday -- and has offered support to @entity35 in recent days			1
@entity5 ambassador to @entity35 @entity100 was in the march , as was assistant secretary of state @entity102			1
at a security summit , @entity62 was joined in those security meetings by deputy homeland security secretary @entity105			0
@entity1 personally visited the @entity35 embassy in @entity3 last week to offer his support			2
secretary of state @entity108 , meanwhile , will visit @entity7 on friday			1
@entity108 skipped monday 's march because he was in @entity111 on monday for a long - planned event there with new prime minister @entity113 -- a key relationship as the @entity5 tries to improve long - strained trade ties with the country			1
@entity108 brushed the criticism off as " quibbling , " saying he 'll visit @entity7 on his way back to the @entity5 to make " crystal clear how passionately we feel " about the attacks and response			1
" the @entity5 has been deeply engaged with the people of @entity35 since this incident occurred , " @entity108 told reporters , adding that the @entity5 has offered intelligence and law enforcement help			1
" this is sort of quibbling a little bit in the sense that our assistant secretary of state @entity102 was there and marched , our ambassador was there and marched , many people from the embassy were there and marched			1
" @entity35 's ambassador to the @entity5 , @entity140 , sought to show there are no hard feelings , tweeting on monday : " i am extremely grateful for the overwhelming support @entity35 has received from everybody here , from the president to the ordinary @entity5			2
" the @entity9 's push - back comes as @entity1 takes heat -- particularly from republicans considering 2016 presidential bids -- for his absence			1
@entity152 tweeted that @entity1 " should have stood with @entity35 in person to defend @entity155 values and show support for victims			2
" sen. @entity158 ( @entity159 ) wrote for @entity160 : " our president should have been there , because we must never hesitate to stand with our allies			0
" and sen. @entity165 ( @entity166 ) said monday that " it was a mistake not to send someone			0
" @entity165 said on @entity170 ' " @entity169 " that he understands that the president 's security detail can be problem in mass gatherings like the rally , but suggested @entity62 or @entity108 should have gone in his place			1
" i think in hindsight , i would hope , that they would do it differently , " @entity165 said			0
@entity40 prime minister @entity180 , @entity41 chancellor @entity181 , @entity42 prime minister @entity182 , @entity184 president @entity183 and @entity44 foreign minister @entity185 were among those who attended , along with religious leaders			1
@entity188 , host of @entity2 's " @entity189 , " called the absence of top @entity5 officials a mistake			0
@entity35 is the @entity5 ' " deepest ideological ally , " he said , and it would have been a meaningful image to have a senior administration member , or the president , standing shoulder to shoulder with other leaders			2
@entity188 noted that security concerns did n't dissuade @entity182 or @entity183 or other leaders from showing up			0
but @entity1 's absence did show that the struggle against radical @entity203 is " not all about @entity5 , " @entity188 said			0
" many people have tended to think that @entity203 terrorism would n't exist without @entity5 , " @entity188 said			0
" this is really a struggle between the civilized world and a band of extremists			0
even if you take the @entity5 out of it ... the civilized world is up in arms			0
" and @entity213 , host of @entity2 's " the lead , " said @entity5 leaders were conspicuously absent from historic @entity7 rally , perhaps the most important public demonstrations in @entity218 in the last generation			1
@entity213 not only called out the president and his administration , but also prospective 2016 hopefuls from both parties , for missing the opportunity to share in the global moment			0
@entity1 spoke about the @entity7 attacks on friday , saying he wants the people of @entity35 to know the @entity5 " stands with you today , stands with you tomorrow			1
" the @entity9 also announced sunday that it will host a february 18 summit aimed at countering violent extremism			2
@entity8 said that event will " highlight domestic and international efforts to prevent violent extremists and their supporters from radicalizing , recruiting or inspiring individuals or groups in the @entity5 and abroad to commit acts of violence , efforts made even more imperative in light of recent , tragic attacks in @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity7			2
" he said the summit will include presentations , panel discussions and small group meetings , focused on the local , state and federal government levels			0
@entity2 's @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity254 contributed to this report			0

the @entity9 said it should have sent a higher - profile representative to a @entity7 unity march
at least 1.5 million people attended the *anti-terrorism* rally in @entity35 , including several world leaders
