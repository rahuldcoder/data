the @entity0 left the @entity1 more than a dozen years ago " dead broke " and in debt , according to @entity3 , who defended the hefty speaking fees she commands since stepping down as secretary of state last year			1
in a wide - ranging interview with @entity10 's @entity9 that aired on monday , the former secretary of state also said that the deadly 2012 terror attack on the @entity13 diplomatic compound in @entity14 , @entity15 , would give her " more of a reason to run " for president again than a rationale for not doing so			1
the interview comes just as @entity21 's new book , " @entity25 , " about her years as @entity24 's first secretary of state hits bookstores on tuesday			1
it 's the latest look at her storied career in the global spotlight as first lady , @entity13 senator , presidential candidate and top diplomat			0
she made headlines in a clip of the interview that aired on " @entity39 " in which she defended her hefty speaking fees , noting that she knew what it was like to experience tough financial circumstances in the winter of 2001			1
she said her family " came out of the @entity1 not only dead broke but in debt , " adding later that her family had " no money " at that time and " struggled to piece together the resources " for mortgages and her daughter @entity54 's college education			0
" you know , it was not easy , " she said			0
the @entity0 departed the @entity1 in debt due to enormous legal fees			0
by the end of 2000 , their debt totaled somewhere between $ 2.28 million to $ 10.6 million			2
but former presidents and first ladies have the ability to make a lot of money , and the @entity0 were no exception and have done so			0
@entity21 made more than $ 9.2 million in speaking fees in 2001 and more than $ 9.5 million in 2002			1
they paid off their legal fees by 2004			2
a @entity71 analysis of the family 's financial records in early 2013 showed that @entity21 had earned $ 106 million from paid speeches since leaving the presidency behind			1
in 2012 alone , he earned $ 17 million in fees			1
although she regularly speaks for free at certain events , @entity77 reported earlier this year that @entity21 made roughly $ 5 million on the speaking circuit since stepping down as @entity13 's top diplomat			1
@entity21 did not dispute the figure when @entity9 asked about it			2
though not as profitable as her husband - who has made as much as $ 750,000 in one speech - @entity3 reportedly commands $ 200,000 per speech			1
the two also have received hefty advances for their books			0
@entity3 said the former first family eventually turned around their finances , noting that her husband has " worked really hard and it has been amazing to me			2
" she noted that they had to pay off debts , get their houses arranged and " take care of family members			0
" @entity21 has become a staple on the paid speaking circuit			1
she has appeared before an array of audiences , including trade associations , business groups and college students			0
asked if she thought @entity13 could understand making " five times the median income in this country for one speech , " @entity21 said she " thought making speeches for money was a much better thing than getting connected with any one group or company as so many people who leave public life do			2
" @entity117 , the pro-republican opposition research shop that along with the @entity118 , takes the lead in criticizing @entity21 , was quick to ping her over her comments to @entity10 , saying they " reveal someone who is extremely out of touch with financial reality facing @entity13			1
" on its website , @entity125 said the two homes the @entity0 purchased after leaving the @entity1 in @entity128 , @entity129 , and @entity131 cost around $ 4.5 million combined			2
on @entity14 , @entity132 contend that the attack that killed ambassador @entity134 and four @entity13 illustrates @entity24 administration foreign policy failures			0
@entity137 say ongoing @entity118 - led scrutiny is political and designed to undercut any potential @entity21 candidacy			0
" i view this as really apart from - even a diversion from - the hard work that the @entity145 should be doing about the problems facing our country and the world , " @entity21 said , noting that the @entity13 should be " in the majors " on world affairs			0
@entity21 has taken responsibility for the attack in the past and she did so again in the clip released by @entity10			1
but in this interview , @entity21 defended herself by saying she " was not making security decisions " for the @entity14 compound			1
" well , i certainly would give anything on earth if this had not happened , " @entity21 said			0
" and i certainly would wish that we had made some of the changes that came to our attention to make as a result of the investigation			0
but i also am clear in my own mind that we had a system and that system , of course , ended with me			0
