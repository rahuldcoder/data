being a parent has suddenly become a lot more stressful			0
at least it has if you live in @entity5			1
lawmakers in the island have outlawed @entity8 and other electronic gadgets for children under the age of two , and demanded that those under the age of 18 do not use digital media for " a period of time that is not reasonable			1
" parents who fail to comply with the new " @entity17 " -- or rather , fail to enforce it upon their children -- may be fined 50,000 @entity5 dollars ( $ 1,576 )			1
now , as much as i dislike the excesses of bloated , interfering governments , i could n't help but emit a yelp of joy when i read of these developments in @entity5 ( which follow similar measures in @entity27 and @entity28 )			1
of course , there are obvious difficulties with the legislation			1
for a start , it fails to define a " reasonable " length of time , leaving its application open to interpretation and abuse			1
moreover , how can the law possibly be enforced ? the government can hardly install some sort of spyware on every tablet and games console sold in the country			0
most irritatingly of all , the measures also seem to ride roughshod over personal privacy			0
dealing with the mother - in - law was bad enough			0
now politicians are telling us how to parent our kids ? ( talk about the " nanny state " )			0
nevertheless , i could n't help but feel that as a symbolic gesture , the new @entity5 legislation is important			1
the fact is that doctors ' advice on screen - time has been clear for years -- and for years , it has been comprehensively ignored by most parents			1
the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) , the most influential body to have released such guidelines , recommends that " television and other entertainment media should be avoided for infants and children under age two			1
" " a child 's brain develops rapidly during these first years , and young children learn best by interacting with people , not screens , " it says			2
for older children , screen - time should be limited to two hours per day			1
the @entity77 , part of the @entity80 @entity79 , points out that " despite what ads may say , videos that are aimed at very young children do not improve their development			2
" depressingly , however , the vast majority of parents are either unaware of the guidelines and dangers , or they simply disregard them			0
research has shown that in the @entity80 , children have between five and seven hours a day of screen - time , roughly triple the @entity62 's maximum			1
and @entity94 psychologist @entity93 says that the average seven - year - old will have spent the equivalent of an entire year in front of a screen			0
in @entity101 , a study called @entity100 found that 45 % of eight - year - olds and 80 % of 16 - year - olds exceed the recommended screen - time allowance			2
let us be clear : the @entity62 guidelines might be rather black and white , but they are vitally important			2
dismissing them , researchers believe , can cause children to have impaired brain development ; an increased risk of attention problems , anxiety and depression ; behavioral difficulties ; obesity ; sleep loss ; poor academic performance ; and physical complaints			2
yet many parents continue to put their heads in the sand			0
partly , the option of a digital babysitter is simply too tempting			2
in addition , there is a perception that electronic media can be beneficial or educational for children			1
as one study put it , " the immediate practical advantages and believed educational benefits of entertaining children with screen media often override the long - term harm that many [ parents ] feel does not apply			1
" that 's not to say that parents are devoid of good reasons to be skeptical			0
every new medium , from novels to radio , has been accused of corrupting the young , and there could be something rather shrill in the medical establishment 's opposition to digital media			1
it is indisputable that technology is increasingly dominating our lives ; children who are able to write code or use @entity154 will have a significant advantage as adults			2
furthermore , a number of academics have drawn a distinction between harmful and beneficial screen - time			2
zero to three , a nonprofit early childhood organization , argues that harm could be reduced if parents made screen - time " a shared experience , " and if children still had lots of time to play in the " real , @entity169 world			1
" similarly , the @entity170 has argued that " young children may benefit from computer use " if the software is sufficiently interactive and " empowering			2
" but such studies can be exaggerated			0
it is worth noting , for instance , that even the @entity170 study emphasizes that " excessive screen time harms healthy growth and development , regardless of content "			0
and the @entity62 , which reviewed its guidelines in 2011 , has not seen fit to significantly alter them			0
the fact remains that as a benchmark , the @entity62 guidelines deserve to be taken seriously			0
the alternative is to play @entity189 roulette with your child 's wellbeing			0
moreover -- and this is the important point -- the extent to which the guidelines are being smashed is massive			0
most children in developed countries are consuming double , triple , or even quadruple the accepted healthy level of screen - time			1
even the most educational app is unlikely to make a meaningful difference to that			0
there 's no point in sugaring the pill			0
if kids are n't encouraged to unplug , they are likely to turn into some rather unhappy adults			0
this is n't something i say very often , but hurrah for the @entity5 nanny state .			1
