@entity0 unveiled his much anticipated plans for the @entity2 by releasing his 57 - page technical white paper titled " @entity4			1
" the @entity2 is intended to become the " fifth " mode of transportation -- a tube under or over the ground that would transport a dozen or so people in individual pods			1
the actual size will likely depend on technology , but the idea is to provide exceptionally fast service to the traveling public between cities under 900 miles apart			1
the innovation could move people from @entity20 to @entity21 in 30 minutes with the pods traveling up to 800 miles per hour			0
it all sounds pretty cool and very space age			0
( @entity24 , anyone ? ) is it too good to be true ? yes , for now			0
but that does n't make the idea any less relevant			0
the white paper properly draws attention to the future			1
indeed , from a layman 's perspective , @entity0 seems to lay out a plausible path for the applied technology needed to bring the @entity2 into reality			1
recall that steam railroads were almost as pie - in - the - sky before @entity41 inventor @entity40 invented the first workable prototype steam locomotive in 1784			0
the idea of propelling humans at " break neck " speeds of between 25 or 35 miles per hour , let alone 50 miles per hour or more by 1850 , was considered the stuff of fancy			0
@entity2 is n't the only transportation idea out there in more contemporary times , stunning transportation infrastructure projects have achieved feats unthinkable until technological breakthroughs made them possible			1
@entity55 's @entity54 is the tallest bridge in the world , with its roadway suspended 890 feet ( 270 meters ) above the valley of the @entity61 and one of its towers rising to 1,124 feet ( 343 meters )			2
but the historical reality is that economic hurdles may prove more important than the technological ones			1
in the longer term , the @entity2 will have to deliver a service the traveling consumer will want and be willing to pay for before it can create the revolution @entity0 envisions			1
on this point , the @entity54 provides critical insights into what could make the @entity2 a success			1
constructing the bridge was technically impossible just decades earlier , and improvements in technology on the margin slowly made the concept feasible			2
new developments in materials and computer - controlled construction techniques brought it into the realm of possibility and profitability			0
the potential profitability may well be the more important element			2
the bridge was built by a private construction company , @entity91 , under a 75 - year concession that would be paid by tolls			0
in other words , the company had enough confidence in the practical benefits of the bridge that it was willing to commit to a half billion to the project			0
those practical benefits would have to be paid for by consumers through tolls			2
without the tolls , the project would likely not have gotten off the ground , even though it was technologically feasible and it could cut travel times by as much as four hours			2
thus , while the @entity2 may be theoretically if not be technically feasible now , the real long - run hurdle for @entity0 and the project 's developers will be whether the new transportation system provides a tangible benefit significant enough to a large enough swath of the traveling public that its costs will be justified by the benefits they receive			1
hyperloop vs. world 's fastest trains notably , using similar technology , 12 bridges with higher road decks have been built since the opening of the @entity54 ( although it still retains the record as the highest bridge )			2
mega-projects are often judged by their technical merits			0
but these projects need to do more than satisfy the egos of engineers and futurists			0
their social impact and practical importance depend crucially on their ability to deliver broad - based benefits in tangible ways that become the foundation for long - term sustainability			0
@entity0 has done an admirable job of setting the stage for a useful public discussion			1
now we should be more focused on the long - run economic merits of his proposal instead of the short - term technical hurdles .			1

@entity0 released a white paper about @entity2 , a fast mode of transportation
@entity155 : @entity2 may sound like *science* *fiction* , but it 's probably feasible
he says economic hurdles may prove more important than the technological ones
@entity155 : @entity2 's existence will depend a lot on what consumers are willing to pay
