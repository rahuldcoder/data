-- it 's been a long time			1
but i can not forget my first school lunch			1
call it free or call it charity , but it was a good meal that provided me , and so many others , with sustenance that made our school days more delightful			2
our meals honored the traditions of the time -- red beans and rice with smoked sausage , bread and perhaps dessert			2
and of course every friday we had fish sticks , potato salad or @entity25 fries			0
we 've come a long way since then			0
today , most public school children get perfectly balanced meals			0
school chefs use food selected to provide maximum nutrition , food that will enhance a student 's well - being and learning abilities			1
their standards come from federal nutrition experts in the @entity37 @entity36 who survey what important foods are missing from children 's diets			1
more than 90 % of the nation 's schools follow these criteria			1
come september , guidelines for healthier snacks will be added			0
still , for all our efforts , the @entity48 reports that , because of a poor diet , one - third of our children are on the path to diabetes			1
regulations implementing the nutritional guidelines must be legislated by @entity57			0
as it considers the @entity59 , @entity57 -- especially @entity48 republicans -- will have to decide if it represents the interests of our children or of special food lobbyists			1
for example , the @entity65 - based @entity64 has sought , and received , congressional support to grant a one - year waiver from the standards to schools that can demonstrate six months of financial loss			1
the group represents 55,000 school lunch workers and nutritionists			2
but the @entity75 quoted a health professional who said the group reflects its funders , who are mostly frozen food and agribusiness interests			1
getting our children healthy lunches has had bipartisan origins			1
the healthy school lunch program was put forth during the @entity87 years , and strengthened with the @entity85 @entity84 saw successfully to adoption in 2010			1
implementing @entity36 healthy lunch standards has met with some schools ' resistance , according to the @entity92 and the @entity64			1
but why ? after all , a @entity36 study found only 0.15 % of the schools surveyed said they were having difficulty complying with the healthy foods standards			2
and the same study found that upward of 90 % of the schools involved are successfully meeting the guidelines			0
that finding confirms another study done in 2012 by the @entity102 and @entity103 , " a collaboration between the @entity105 and the @entity106 that provides nonpartisan analysis and evidence - based recommendations " on food standards			2
it found 94 % of school districts were on board to meeting the healthy food guidelines			1
@entity114 , a nutritionist and director with @entity105 , told the press , " we are disappointed ( with this waiver ) that would weaken national nutrition standards for foods served in schools			0
" indeed , more than 100 child nutrition experts at national , state and local levels released a petition to @entity57 on may 19 , requesting lawmakers fight , and end , the waiver to opt out of all the breakfast and lunch standards for schoolchildren			2
we are beginning to reverse childhood obesity ; it has fallen among preschoolers			0
but childhood obesity doubled during the past 30 years			0
our progress is tiny but encouraging			0
the proposed waiver appears to be an attempt to buy time so the frozen food industry and agribusinesses can worm their foods into the schools			1
the provision is opposed by hundreds of nonpartisan , nonprofit nutrition organizations and supported by just a handful of powerful junk food interests			2
@entity57 appears willing to gamble with our children 's health at the same time @entity153 , a @entity155 health expert , declares that " unhealthy diets are greater threat to health than tobacco			2
" ironically , @entity153 calls for global regulation of salty , sugary foods , just when some members of @entity57 seem ready to abandon our own standards			0
providing our children with healthy food will reduce future health care costs			1
so why is this too being turned into a partisan dodge ? @entity169 in @entity57 have limited a pilot program that will test efficient ways to deliver foods during the summer only to children in rural low - income households			0
( this is not to be confused with the @entity176 , which will continue to deliver meals to urban and rural children alike			0
) the excuse given by a @entity181 spokeswoman is that rural children are scattered over wider areas and so " have some unique challenges			0
" as if urban children going hungry do n't face " unique challenges			0
" the @entity48 version of the @entity59 also seeks to add starchy , white potatoes to the list of " qualified vegetables " under the @entity192 , or @entity192 , supplemental feeding program for pregnant women and young children			1
this move comes after heavy lobbying by the white potato industry , which wants the prestige of qualifying for @entity192 and the marketing advantage that comes with it			0
@entity57 should say no to the special interests , stop turning the well - being of our children into a partisan tool and focus on our children 's health and their future			2
join us on @entity209 / @entity208 .			0

@entity211 says republicans want to undo @entity84 's gains in healthy lunches
@entity48 bill would grant waivers , allow potatoes to be considered as " qualified " vegetable
@entity211 : frozen food , agribusiness want to whittle away at healthy lunch programs
