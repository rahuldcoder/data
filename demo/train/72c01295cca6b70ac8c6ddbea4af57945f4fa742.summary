-- one hundred and sixty - five years ago , in @entity3 , @entity4 , a carpenter named @entity2 built a sawmill to harness the power of the @entity7			0
below the waterwheel , he saw flakes of metal where the spent water flowed			0
@entity2 marked the moment saying , " i have found it			0
" he had discovered gold in @entity4 and more : for the next century , our nation would mine its future in the @entity20			1
by the 1950s , @entity4 had manufactured an optimistic nation 's dreams , brought them to life in the steel and smoke of industry and then captured them on celluloid			1
business bloomed in deserts , nourishing one of the world 's great economies			1
a green @entity34 of farmland , the @entity36 where the sun shone 300 days a year , grew one third of @entity40 's produce			1
innovation followed discovery : @entity44 , it turned out , was even more valuable than gold			0
@entity4 's public sector also boomed			1
the state built a web of roads , bridges and aqueducts that shamed their @entity53 inventors			0
it funded world - class universities to prepare beach boys and @entity4 girls for lives of endless promise			0
to see where the rest of the country would be in 20 years , we could look at @entity4			0
but the roads to success and failure are often almost the same			0
as the state gorged on its success , @entity4 's transportation arteries grew clogged			1
the public sector 's blood began to thicken			2
@entity4 moved faster , their problems grew more complex and their demands on government accelerated			2
the state 's aging public sector could not respond with matching dynamism and flexibility			2
even as the state poured more money into education , transportation and public safety , it delivered less value in them			0
government grew larger and more expensive , with less and less to show for it			2
finally , when the housing bubble collapsed , state revenue did too			0
@entity4 's river of gold dried up			2
the waterwheel would not turn			0
today , @entity4 owes hundreds of billions : $ 300 billion alone in pension obligations			0
even after gov. @entity99 's effort to pay down $ 28 billion of immediate debt , @entity4 's liabilities for retiree pensions and health care exceed what it spends for all state programs combined			1
@entity4 's future looks anything but golden			1
taxpayers who do n't want to be left footing the bills are in exodus			0
the state 's politics is as paralyzing as @entity111 's			2
to see our nation 's bright future in 20 years , can we still look at @entity4 ? maybe so			1
sometimes , the first green shoots emerge in the forest where everything burned			0
--- @entity118 is difficult to classify			1
tall , slim and rakishly elegant , he could be the @entity7 reincarnation of @entity121 actor @entity120			0
a contradictory combination of left and right , he is a liberal hero for legalizing gay marriage in his city and a liberal villain for reforming its overly generous welfare cash payment program			0
the 45 - year - old @entity118 , a @entity128 who is now @entity4 's lieutenant governor , is more than a government theorist , however			1
he owns 17 small businesses with about 1,000 employees			0
his confederation includes three wineries that make luscious , fruit - forward elixirs			2
in business , he is a swashbuckling entrepreneur whose motto is " anyone who is not failing is n't trying hard enough			0
" what is most revolutionary about @entity118 is that in government , he 's an entrepreneur as well			1
when @entity118 became mayor of @entity142 , he found a city with little money to meet social needs and behind @entity146 and @entity147 in digital governance			1
his push to modernize @entity142 without expanding its dysfunctional public sector is the launching point of his new book , " @entity153			0
" it is a fertile garden of original thinking			0
the lieutenant governor argues that government 's biggest problem is not that it is misguided but that it is archaic			1
@entity118 cites open - source software pioneer @entity162 's analogy for government			1
" we think of government as a vending machine : you put money in , services come out			1
" when something goes wrong , @entity118 points out , we shake the vending machine out of frustration			1
if we feed it more money , it is to little effect : vending machines are not particularly innovative or adaptive			2
our government is still built on that model , @entity118 reports , the outdated , industrial - age paradigm of the factory , though everything else in our personal lives and our private sector has moved past it			1
simultaneously , an explosion of technology , social media and e-commerce has created a more informed and empowered citizenry			0
a " citizenville , " @entity118 writes , now has the power and connectivity to solve problems in new ways , e.g. , determining where tax dollars are spent , how crime is fought and where garbage trucks go			1
speaking through their laptops and @entity200 , people are increasingly able to organize themselves and solve social problems , independent of the old , creaky , public - sector industrial plant			2
" technology changes the very nature of government -- from a top - down entity to a bottom - up one			2
from one - way hierarchy to two - way democracy			0
from vending machine to the cloud , " he explains			1
if we open the doors of government to the private sector and make data accessible , we can jump - start a new era of social innovation			1
open up the doors of government satellite data and you get @entity223			1
give web designers in @entity226 and @entity227 access to public police data , and they create innovative crime - mapping tools that prevent muggings			2
invent a digital " currency " to reward citizens for participating in their own governance , and small town decision - making becomes as interesting and involving as @entity235			0
" the future is sharing -- open data , open participation , open source , open everything , " @entity118 writes			1
" and it must happen at every level			0
" our old , marbled shrines to bureaucracy have grown unserviceable and unaffordable			0
can we continue to justify them when mayors are using @entity248 to address constituent needs instead ? the lesson : the public sector no longer has a monopoly on government			2
we are in a new world of revolutionary and empowering technologies			0
@entity40 are n't waiting for @entity111 or @entity256 to reinvent government for the next century ; they are creating an app for that			1
with it , they are creating a new path for democratic vitality			0
now , people - to - people government is an alternative to one that flowed only to people from the state			1
with new tools and technologies , @entity118 contends , it is time to redefine " government " to seize the opportunities of a new day			1
would we still rather be governed the old way , top down , politically and artificially by plant managers ? or bottom - up , authentically , naturally and organically , through our own decision making and handiwork ? perhaps this has been the promise of the @entity7 experiment in self - government all along , and we have only been waiting for the powerful and democratizing technology of the communications age to seize it			2
once more , when we need it most , maybe @entity4 has discovered gold again			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity286 .			1

calif. *lt.* gov. @entity118 *advocates* a *rethinking* of government for 21st century
@entity286 says @entity118 's idea could make government more effective , closer to the people
he says @entity118 is right to say the future is open source , open data , open participation
@entity286 : the model for government changes from a vending machine to the cloud
