people often ask me what advice i would give the @entity3 about various things			1
today i was mulling over election results from @entity6 and @entity7 while thinking about that very question			2
what should the @entity3 do now ? one word came to mind : panic			1
we are far past sending out talking points			2
do not attempt to dumb it down			2
we can not stand any more explanations			2
have you talked to any @entity18 senators lately ? i have			2
it 's pretty damn clear they are not happy campers			1
this is what i would say to president @entity25 : the time has come to demand a plan of action that requires a complete change from the direction you are headed			1
i do n't know how else to break this down			1
no -- fire a lot of people			1
this may be news to you but this is not going well			2
for precedent , see @entity41 army 64th division at @entity42			2
there were enough deaths at @entity42 to make the entire tea party collectively orgasm			2
mr. president , your hinge of fate must turn			1
@entity50 fired many people in 1994 and took a lot of heat for it			2
@entity55 fired most of his campaign staff in 1980			0
@entity57 historically fired their own speaker , @entity58			0
@entity60 fired defense secretary @entity61			0
for @entity64 's sake , why are we still looking at the same political and economic advisers that got us into this mess ? it 's not working			1
furthermore , it 's not going to work with the same team , the same strategy and the same excuses			1
i know economic analysts are smart -- some work 17 - hour days			0
it 's time to show them the exit			1
wake up -- show us you are doing something			0
there are certain people in @entity86 finance who have n't been held responsible for utterly ruining the economic fabric of our country			1
demand from the attorney general a clear status of the state of investigation concerning these extraordinary injustices imposed upon the @entity86 people			0
i know attorney general @entity97 is a close friend of yours , but if his explanations are n't good , fire him too			1
demand answers to why no one has been indicted			0
mr. president , people are livid			1
tell people that you , too , are angry and sickened by the irresponsible actions on @entity107 that caused so much suffering			1
make a case like a @entity112			0
while we are going along with the @entity57 austerity garbage , who is making the case against it ? it 's not the @entity18 ! we are allowing the over-educated , over-explanatory bureaucrat by the name of ( @entity122 director @entity121 ) @entity123 do all the talking			1
do not let him make your case			0
let us make your case			0
is it any wonder that we were doing better in the middle of the stimulus - spending period than we are doing with the austerity program ? 4			0
hold fast to an explanation			0
stick to your rationale for what has happened and what is going to happen under your leadership			0
you must carry this through until the election ( never say that things are improving because evidently they are not )			0
as i watch the @entity57 debates , i realize that we are on the brink of a crazy person running our nation			0
i sit in front of the television and shudder at the thought of one of these creationism - loving , global - warming - denying , immigration - bashing , @entity155 - cutting , clean - air - hating , mortality - fascinated , @entity157 - street - protecting republicans running my country			0
the course we are on is not working			1
the hour is late , and the need is great			0

@entity164 : special elections are a *warning* to @entity3
he says president @entity25 's *approach* is n't working , needs *urgent* fix
@entity25 should fire staffers whose *policies* are n't effective
