@entity0 -- the @entity2 unanimously ruled against the @entity3 over its exclusive contract with an apparel maker in one of the most important sports law cases in decades			1
in a 9 - 0 decision monday , the justices said the league can be considered 32 separate teams , not a single business			2
the court allowed a lawsuit against the league to continue , saying the licensing of intellectual property " constitutes concerted action " that is not part of the broad antitrust protection enjoyed by professional baseball			1
such protection allows individual teams to act as one business when making a host of financial decisions , including marketing their logos and trademarks			0
the outcome could affect other sports franchises with similar limited antitrust exemption , as well as businesses that have cooperative networks , such as credit card companies			1
the @entity35 , the @entity36 , the @entity37 , @entity38 , professional tennis and @entity40 backed the @entity3 in its appeal , seeking similarly broad antitrust protection			1
" decisions by @entity3 teams to license their separately owned trademarks collectively and to only one vendor are decisions that ' deprive the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking , ' " justice @entity51 wrote for the court , " and therefore of actual or potential competition			1
" the case involves a lawsuit from @entity56 , an @entity57 - based sports apparel maker that was one of several companies with long - standing contracts with @entity61 , a separate corporate entity that develops , licenses and markets the intellectual property of each team			1
but in 2001 , the league entered into an exclusive 10 - year contract with @entity68 to manufacture hats , jackets and other clothing featuring team logos			1
@entity56 is no longer able to negotiate with individual teams			1
some fans have complained that the prices on such gear have skyrocketed in the absence of competition from other apparel makers			0
a @entity83 " replica jersey " with the name of star quarterback @entity85 , for example , now is listed for $ 108 on the team 's web site			0
@entity56 complained that the deal violated a 120 - year - old antitrust law designed to limit cartels and monopolies , and to foster fair competition in the marketplace			1
the key section of the law bans business rivals from conspiring to blunt competition or hurt consumers , by either increasing prices or limiting choices			0
" the court vindicated the position of @entity104 needle , " said @entity99 , attorney for the company			0
the ruling reinstates the firm 's lawsuit against the @entity3			1
@entity99 said the result of the @entity68 deal was that the league 's 32 teams " put all of their intellectual property under the control of a single licensee , @entity68 , and prices [ went ] up by 150 percent			1
" " the case has to go forward , and @entity56 is entitled to its day in court , " @entity99 added			1
he said he was not surprised by the unanimous decision			0
the ruling overturned of a 7th @entity104 @entity122 decision that the league was one , not 32			0
baseball is the only sports league that enjoys complete antitrust protection			1
the @entity3 has long sought similar status			1
the dilemma is acute because of the unique nature of pro sports , including @entity130 and its 32 teams			0
those teams , including top apparel sellers the @entity134 and the @entity135 , compete against each other on the field and off -- for victories , for players and for their own brands			0
but the league maintains unilateral rules and structure that all teams must follow to ensure parity and an equal playing field			0
the @entity3 negotiates national television contracts and deals with the players ' union through collective bargaining			2
the league says trademark licensing primarily benefits the on - field competition			2
" a sports league produces a single entertainment product , " the league told the high court , " a structured series of athletic competitions leading to a championship , that no member club could produce on its own			2
" but @entity56 countered that the structure does not erase the fact that " the teams are separately owned and controlled profit - making enterprises			2
they are actual and potential competitors in numerous areas , including the licensing of intellectual properties			2
" the @entity170 administration supported neither side , saying the league can be considered a single business in some areas but not others			0
@entity51 noted that the ruling will not completely hamstring the league			0
" @entity178 teams that need to cooperate are not trapped by antitrust law , " he wrote			1
" the fact that @entity3 teams share an interest in making the entire league successful and profitable , and that they must cooperate in the production and scheduling of games provides a perfectly sensible justification for making a host of collective decisions			1
but the conduct at issue in this case is still concerted activity under the @entity194			0
" the ruling throws the dispute back to the lower federal courts to sort out the parameters of a possibly reworked licensing agreement that presumably would favor @entity104 needle			0
retail sales of @entity3 - licensed merchandise in the @entity104 and @entity203 was about $ 3.2 billion in 2007 , according to the trade journal @entity205			2
the combined total for football , baseball , hockey , basketball and soccer is more than $ 9 billion annually			0
among those backing the league are credit card companies , fearing that a ruling against the @entity3 could set a precedent that would hurt the federation of banks that constitutes the credit card network for companies like @entity221 and @entity222			1
workers ' rights groups feared that a win for the sports league could have boosted its power in other off - field activities , perhaps giving owners immunity from lawsuits in areas like television rights , video - game licenses , franchise relocation and possibly athlete salaries			2
unions also expressed concern that the current legal fight could lead to labor unrest and possible player strikes , since the leagues might be protected legally from accusations owners conspired to keep down salaries			0
athletes say salaries , free agency rights and pensions could also have been affected by a ruling against them			0
the @entity250 backed @entity56 in the high court appeal			2
the case is @entity104 needle v. @entity3 ( 08 - 661 )			1
@entity1 's @entity254 contributed to this report .			0
