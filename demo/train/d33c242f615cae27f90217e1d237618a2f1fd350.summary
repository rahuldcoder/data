-- " i shall never surrender or retreat			0
" so stated @entity2 in an 1836 letter he wrote as @entity5 soldiers bore down on his overmatched troops at the @entity7			0
now , more than 175 years later , @entity2 ' @entity9 fighting heirs -- or , at the least , the state 's governor -- are drawing their line in the sand for another reason : not to grant benefits to same - sex partners of its troops as they would for opposite - sex spouses			1
" as a state agency , @entity23 must adhere with @entity9 law , and the @entity26 , which clearly defines marriage as between one man and one woman , " said @entity20 , a spokesman for gov. @entity22 's office			1
despite its proud and longstanding tradition of independence , the @entity23 is not like other agencies			0
in fact , given that it includes the @entity34 and @entity35 ( in addition to the @entity37 ) , in some ways it is more a federal agency than a state one			0
as such , some argue , its policies should fall in line with those out of @entity46			0
following a landmark @entity48 ruling that effectively struck down the @entity50 , which prohibited federal benefits from going to same - sex partner , the door has now been opened to gay and lesbian spouses			1
shortly before leaving office earlier this year , defense secretary @entity56 announced that same - sex partners who sign a military " @entity61 " form will be eligible for several benefits , including military identification cards as dependents			1
those who did would be allowed unescorted onto bases , get access to commissaries , have the right to visit their partners in military hospitals and be eligible for many survivor benefits , including life insurance benefits			0
military extends benefits to same - sex partners the @entity77 estimated at the time that there may be 5,600 troops on active duty seeking such benefits , as well as 8,000 retirees and 3,400 @entity84 troops			2
tuesday was the first day all partners of same - sex troops could claim such benefits , the @entity77 has said			2
but in the latter category , @entity9 is n't readily coming aboard			0
@entity9 , like some other states , expressly prohibits same - sex marriage under its law			1
that state law trumps federal law , argues @entity22 and others			0
" ( @entity23 ) is a state agency under the authority and direction of the @entity9 state government , " wrote the forces ' adjutant general , maj. gen. @entity94 , in a memo dated august 30			2
" ... due to the potential conflict ( between state and federal law ) , we are unable to enroll same - sex families ... at our state - supported facilities until we receive legal clarification			1
" in a statement tuesday , the @entity23 insisted that while @entity113 is asking the state 's attorney general for an advisory opinion , " the state is not denying any federal benefits to military personnel or same - sex spouses of military personnel			1
" " this is a processing issue , not a denial of benefits issue , " the agency says			2
" as such , we fully encourage eligible members to enroll for their federal benefits at one of the 20 nearest federal installations , which are dispersed throughout the state of @entity9			1
" judge : @entity128 ca n't deny benefits to lesbian war vet 's wife the office of state attorney general @entity133 did not respond to a @entity1 request for comment on the matter			0
yet @entity137 , the president of the @entity138 , sees what 's happening in @entity9 as " truly outrageous , " claiming that same - sex partners are being denied certain rights and benefits simply because they 're based in the @entity9			1
" gov. @entity22 should be ashamed , " @entity137 said tuesday , accusing @entity9 policymakers of playing " politics with our military families			1
" " our military families are already dealing with enough problems , and the last thing they need is more discrimination from the state of @entity9			2
" @entity1 's @entity151 contributed to this report .			0
