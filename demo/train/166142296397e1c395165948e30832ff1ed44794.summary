-- one of the biggest holiday weeks is upon us			1
@entity3 is a favorite day for football fans , close - knit families , families who ca n't stand each other , and of course , amateur competitive eaters			1
but what 's really interesting about @entity3 is the day after -- known as @entity11			1
it may well be the most publicized -- and puzzling -- commercial day of the year			1
according to the @entity13 , last year 's @entity11 attracted more than 90 million online and in - store shoppers			1
online shoppers can buy things from the comfort and safety of their homes			2
but what about those who succumb to mass hysteria at local megastores ? we have all seen the " shopacalypse " on the evening news , which appears constrained only by the flimsy protection of a few @entity28 and some security guys			2
when you step back and think about it , it seems strange that in an era of increasing civil liability , large retailers would invite this bedlam , and the likely personal - injury lawsuits that follow			1
there 's even a website , @entity40 , which tracks and compiles statistics on injuries and deaths			1
are we really surprised people get hurt on @entity11 ? granted , it 's an open invitation to every nudnik , whose only qualifications are : 1 ) they do n't have to be at work ; and 2 ) they are willing to wake up at 5 a.m. to elbow their way to saving $ 3 on a @entity53 or a @entity54			1
so how do we evaluate the liability of a store for injuries on its premises during @entity11 ? let 's take a look at common law			1
once a person steps onto private property , the law traditionally considered him one of the following : 1 ) trespasser ; 2 ) licensee ; or 3 ) invitee			2
everyone knows what a trespasser is			0
if you enter ( or remain ) on someone 's property without his consent , you are a trespasser			1
deadly force can be used on an intruder in one 's home , but that 's based on defense of self , not defense of property			1
you can use a gun to defend yourself at home against an intruder			0
on the other hand , if you own an abandoned barn , you can not install trip wires attached to shotguns , poison darts , snake pits or any of the traps from the @entity96 movies			0
you might think an " invitee " is someone who is just invited on to the property , say , for a cocktail party , but that 's not it			1
if your buddy invites you over for a @entity105 party , you 're just considered a " licensee			0
" this means you are on the property with permission			0
you 're not providing your pal any business benefit , other than emotional support for his team , and divesting him of his chips and salsa			0
the only obligation your host has to licensees is to inform of the known danger on the property , and any not so obvious danger your host would expect you would n't know about			0
an " invitee , " on the other hand , is someone who enters the land for a purpose connected with or benefiting the business owner			0
when you shop at a store , you 're considered an " invitee			0
" historically , a landowner owed the invitee the highest duty of care , to inspect or warn of defects on the premises			0
in modern times , states and courts alike have increasingly rejected these antiquated distinctions and applied a more universal " reasonable " standard to landowners , sometimes even to trespassers			0
however , whether applying the traditional common law or a modern rule , if you are on someone 's property for the purpose of spending money , courts will hold the landowner to the highest applicable standard of care			2
even the @entity152 has acknowledged the sometimes fatal injuries suffered on @entity11 , and has published crowd management safety guidelines for retailers			1
@entity152 and the @entity156 focus primarily on employers providing workers with safe and healthy workplaces , but their guidelines speak to preventing all injuries at retail sales events , with a specific nod to @entity11			1
the @entity152 guidelines offer suggestions about where a court might look for the standards of care			0
according to the guidelines , there should be adequate security , and sufficient crowd control measures			0
a store is not automatically liable if a customer sucker - punches another customer over an x-box , but it may be liable if the assault were foreseeable and the failure of security measures contributed to the assault			2
the bottom line is that stores will be liable if people are injured by known , unsafe and nonobvious conditions on their property on @entity11 , especially if stores take no special safety or security precautions , and treat the day like any other day			1
if a store knows it is expecting several times its normal traffic , it must anticipate the problems attendant to the increased foot traffic , and the potential for riffraff			0
it 's true that no store can ever prevent a meteor landing on the roof			2
no store can guarantee that another customer wo n't suddenly go mad and punch another person in the head			0
no amount of security can prevent the unpredictable -- it 's the same problem often encountered by stadiums when drunken sports fans attack			2
but , if a store is deliberately indifferent to security problems , then it may be liable where it knowingly ignores the behavior of that riffraff			0
the sweet spot of security is somewhere between the extremes of razor wire and pepper spray , and the minimal effort of a " no shoes , no shirt , no service " sign			0
a simple rule is that stores should be held liable for the increased risk they create -- especially when that risk creation is tied to a direct economic benefit			0
if a @entity11 sale devolves into the running of the bulls in @entity235 , and the store knowingly allowed dangerous conditions on the property , it 's likely that the store will be held liable for injuries on the premises			1
it 's interesting that if you want to hold a rally or protest a grand jury , you might need a permit to exercise your first amendment rights			2
but if you are a big - box retailer holding a big - box sale , it seems that as long as you are generating revenue and paying taxes , you can host the retail equivalent of @entity253 with nary a complaint			1
ultimately , if a mall encourages this behavior , maybe it gets exactly what it deserves			2
maybe the @entity11 retailer deserves the @entity11 shopper			1
so the next time you make fun of people who set out on christmas eve for the mall , remember this : the smattering of losers like me may have waited until the last minute to get our shopping done , but at least no one gets hurt in the process .			0

@entity274 : @entity11 may be the most crazy commercial holiday of the year
he says it 's odd that large retailers invite this chaos , and personal - injury lawsuits
how do we evaluate a sales event that is more like running the bulls in @entity235 ? he asks
@entity274 : maybe the @entity11 retailer deserves the @entity11 shopper
