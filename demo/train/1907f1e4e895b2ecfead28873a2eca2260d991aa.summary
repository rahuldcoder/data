@entity0 became the latest state tuesday in which a federal judge declared its ban on gay marriage to be unconstitutional , delivering yet another victory for same - sex proponents -- albeit not necessarily a definitive one			1
@entity9 magistrate judge @entity8 issued her sweeping opinion knocking down @entity0 state laws and a state constitutional amendment , passed in 2006 , as failing to live up to the @entity9 @entity15 's 14th @entity14 guarantee no " state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws			1
" " @entity0 's marriage laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens the fundamental right to marry and relegate their families to a stigmatized , second - class status without sufficient reason for doing so , " @entity27 wrote			1
" these laws do not withstand any applicable level of constitutional scrutiny			0
" the judge 's order takes effect at 9 a.m. friday			1
it was not immediately known if state authorities in @entity0 , who have been fighting to keep in place the law restricting marriage as being between a man and a woman , will appeal this decision			2
that 's what has happened in several other states , in which federal judges overturned state same - sex marriage bans only to have those decisions stayed on appeal			2
a federal appeals court last month heard challenges to same - sex marriage bans in @entity60 and @entity61			0
appeals courts in coming weeks and months will hear similar challenges over current bans in @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , and @entity69			0
the three judges on the 4th @entity9 @entity71 heard related arguments tuesday			0
their final decision could affect @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 , the latter being the only one of the five with legalized same - sex marriage			0
after that , the @entity81 could then weigh in			0
and late last week in @entity85 , @entity84 circuit judge @entity83 declared the state 's voter - approved gay marriage ban to violate the @entity85 constitution			1
the plaintiffs in the @entity0 case included four same - sex couples			2
they included two of whom married in others states and wanted their unions recognized in @entity0 , and two of whom had children born while they were a couple			0
among other opinions , @entity27 shot down @entity0 authorities ' argument that limiting marriage to a man and a woman is in children 's best interests			2
for example , the judge says there 's nothing preventing heterosexual couples from marrying simply for a tax break , or stopping them from marrying because they ca n't or do n't want to have children or are " non-optimal parents			0
" furthermore , the judge said , those children who have gay or lesbian parents might pay the price , emotionally and otherwise , under the state ban			1
" @entity0 's marriage laws fail to advance the state 's interest because they withhold legal , financial and social benefits from the very group they purportedly protect -- children , " @entity27 wrote			1
the judge also described the state 's contention that gay marriage should be banned in the name of " religious liberty " to be " myopic			1
" " no doubt many faiths around the world and in @entity0 have longstanding traditions of man - woman marriage rooted in scripture , " @entity27 said			2
" but not all religions share the view that opposite - sex marriage is a theological imperative			0
" even if a majority of people in @entity0 oppose same - sex marriage , that does n't mean their opinion should equate to law , according to the judge			1
she stated : " this case asks a basic and enduring question about the essence of @entity9 government : whether the will of the majority , based as it often is on sincere beliefs and democratic consensus , may trump the rights of a minority			0
" appeals court scrutinizes @entity74 same - sex marriage ban			1

@entity0 becomes the latest state in which a state gay marriage ban is struck down
judge : order takes effect this friday *morning* , unless it 's *successfully* appealed
laws " deny its gay and lesbian citizens the fundamental right to marry , " says judge
