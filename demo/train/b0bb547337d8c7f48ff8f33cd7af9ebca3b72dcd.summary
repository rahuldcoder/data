-- the coalition is growing -- not just in words , but in action			0
just over two weeks after @entity6 president @entity5 vowed " @entity6 will lead a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat " posed by @entity9 , more than 50 countries have signed up , so far , to support the fight			1
they include new entrants @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , which will all send fighter jets to @entity17 to assist that nation 's government and the @entity6 in the @entity21 military campaign			1
even the foreign minister of russia -- which has butted heads repeatedly with @entity24 , including over whether the president of neighboring war - torn @entity26 needs to go -- signaled friday his country is ready to back @entity17 in fighting terrorists , " above all the @entity31 , " which is what @entity9 calls itself			1
most members of the @entity34 coalition have restricted their support to @entity17 - focused efforts			2
a handful of @entity39 nations , however , have joined @entity24 in going after @entity9 , from the air , in @entity26			1
@entity9 ' worst nightmare : a female pilot why do it ? ahead of what turned out to be an overwhelming @entity52 vote friday authorizing @entity15 air power , prime minister @entity49 said the world has an obligation to corral a well - funded , highly organized force known for virtually unmatched cruelty -- reviled for its " beheadings , crucifixions , the gouging out of eyes , the use of rape as a weapon , the slaughter of children			1
" " left unchecked , we will face a terrorist caliphate on the shores of the @entity68 and bordering a @entity64 member , with a declared and proven determination to attack our country and our people , " said @entity49 , referring to @entity64 member @entity62			0
still , even as more countries agree to take part in airstrikes and helping @entity17 , that does n't mean this will be a cakewalk			1
no one has pledged combat troops to join @entity17 's oft - maligned military or the various forces -- from moderate opposition forces to their foes in president @entity86 's military -- doing battle with @entity9 in @entity26			1
plus , eliminating a movement of militants who can easily mingle among civilians and strike in myriad , devious ways is n't easy			0
@entity92 raises questions about @entity17 's military ability to beat @entity9 that 's why @entity6 and @entity15 officials , including @entity49 , said coalition forces need to be prepared to devote not weeks , not months , but years to the fight			1
as @entity6 gen. @entity99 , the the chairman of the @entity100 , said friday : " this is going to be a persistent and sustained campaign			2
and it will take time			0
" expert : @entity9 adapting , mixing in with civilians it 's not known if any @entity9 leaders have been killed so far in airstrikes			2
nor is there much evidence the group has lost a big amount of territory , much less that it is in full retreat			0
but that does n't mean the air campaign -- which began in august in @entity17 and a few weeks ago in @entity26 -- has n't had an effect			1
in the @entity119 briefing friday , @entity99 credited airstrikes with disrupting @entity9 command and control activities and logistics in @entity26 as well as helping friendly ground forces begin to take back ground lost to the group			1
@entity0 military analyst @entity126 , a retired @entity127 special operations officer , added that the strikes have helped " blunt the momentum of @entity9 in @entity17			1
" airstrikes also have disrupted @entity9 safe havens on the ground , such as the northern @entity26 town of @entity133 , @entity126 said			1
@entity136 @entity135 fighters helped drive the extremists back and secure positions on the ground			0
strikes have since targeted @entity9 throughout the swaths it holds , and the combined efforts have stopped @entity9 from swarming over @entity142			0
but the group 's command structure is adapting , said @entity0 military analyst @entity145 , a retired @entity127 colonel			0
it is spreading out , and its leaders are now " mixed in with the civilian population , " he said			0
" so , it 's unlikely these airstrikes have crippled @entity9 , " he said			2
big questions about coalition ground partners while @entity99 vowed he will recommend to @entity5 " what it takes to destroy @entity159 , " he said the best mix of ground forces to defeat the extremist groups will be drawn from @entity17 , @entity136 and moderate @entity26 rebels			1
some support has begun flowing to @entity17 and @entity136 forces , including equipment to training			0
then , of course , there 's the growing international air component -- such as @entity14 sending seven @entity168 fighter jets , according to a spokeswoman for that country 's @entity170 -- though new @entity17 prime minister @entity172 told @entity0 this week that his country 's ground troops are n't getting the coordinated " air cover " they need to advance on @entity9 forces			1
a lack of faith right now in @entity17 's military may not help , especially after @entity9 overran the @entity17 @entity181 military base near @entity182 this weekend			1
it was n't just the defeat that stung , but claims from @entity17 soldiers that their pleas for backup went unanswered by military commanders for hours			0
@entity17 officials said they had tried to support them but failed			2
" there is no leadership in the @entity17 army right now , " said retired @entity6 air force lt. col. @entity192			1
" the people who are paying the price are the soldiers in the trenches			0
" for all these issues in @entity17 , what to do on the ground in @entity26 may be even more complicated			1
it 's in the midst of a more than three - year civil war , one that 's seen several groups -- from @entity9 to the moderate opposition that @entity24 supports -- spring up trying to unseat @entity86			0
here , the marshaling of an effective ground partner against @entity9 terrorists has only begun			0
there has been no coordination , " nor will there be , " between @entity24 and @entity86 's government regarding @entity6 airstrikes in @entity26 , @entity6 secretary of defense @entity212 said friday			1
the @entity6 has n't shifted its approach to @entity86 , who has " lost all legitimacy to govern , " according to @entity221			0
@entity222 still a threat in @entity26 , along with @entity9 as all this is being sorted out , the violence continues			2
this includes fresh battles between @entity136 @entity26 fighters and @entity9 militants near a city on the border with @entity62			1
@entity0 's @entity232 , watching the fighting from a hillside in @entity62 , reported hearing small arms and artillery fire as the @entity136 and @entity9 forces fought to advance toward the @entity26 city of @entity39			2
@entity62 @entity136 gathered near the border to watch the fighting cheered whenever @entity9 fighters appeared to take a hit			0
a resident of the city , also known as @entity243 , said @entity9 forces are 2 kilometers ( 1.24 miles ) from the city and that resistance forces are running low on ammunition			0
" we are hoping and waiting for any coalition air strike on these terrorists , to save our city from the barbaric attack , " @entity247 said			0
coalition air power was not evident in the region			0
but earlier in the day , the @entity6 did turn its air power on more isis targets , taking out vehicles in other parts of @entity26 and @entity17 and destroying a command node and a checkpoint			1
a @entity119 official said as of 8 p.m. et friday -- or 3 a.m. saturday in the @entity262 -- that military operations were ongoing in both @entity26 and @entity17			1
@entity9 has been the main target of past strikes , but not only one			0
the air campaign has also gone after the @entity222 , which consists of senior @entity269 operatives that a @entity6 senior official has said was actively plotting attacks in the @entity6 and elsewhere in the @entity272			2
the @entity6 military launched eight @entity275 missiles against @entity222 targets -- including training camps plus command and control facilities -- tuesday west of @entity280 , @entity26			2
the @entity6 government believes at least some senior @entity222 members survived the strikes and that they could continue plotting attacks , a @entity6 government official said friday			2
added @entity287 administrator @entity286 : " i see the @entity222 as a very capable , determined enemy who was very much focused on doing -- getting somebody or something on a plane bound for @entity292 or the @entity6			0
" @entity0 's @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 and @entity301 contributed to this report .			0
