a metal object that washed ashore on @entity3 's coast was n't from @entity4 , officials said			1
detailed pictures of the object were enough to convince investigators that it was n't a lead in the search for the missing plane , the @entity3 agency leading the search for the aircraft said on thursday			1
officials had previously called the piece of metal , which appeared to have rivets on one side , an " object of interest " in the search			1
police picked it up near @entity24 , @entity3 , roughly 1,000 miles away from the suspected crash site , after many futile days of searching for the missing plane			1
authorities have n't said what they think the object could be			1
possible promising leads have turned out to be false alarms for weeks in the lengthy search for the missing plane , which disappeared mid-flight on march 8 with 239 people aboard			2
one major challenge that 's complicated the search : the ocean is full of garbage			1
other objects search teams have spotted in the @entity42 turned out to be trash , jellyfish and fishing gear			2
bad weather grounded planes searching for signs of debris on wednesday			2
and a high - tech underwater drone found no sign of the @entity53 jetliner			2
if nothing turns up in the @entity57 's underwater search , the investigation will move into a new phase that could involve new equipment and an expanded search area			1
and as the search came up empty again , a key question loomed : are they looking in the right place ? " they have been searching for more than a month			1
all of the ships , the planes , the satellites they 're using , not even a small piece of the plane was found , " @entity66 , whose mother was aboard the aircraft , told @entity75 's " the lead with @entity76 " on thursday			1
@entity77 : ' we may rethink the search , but we will not rest ' up to 11 military aircraft and 11 ships are set to search for the plane on thursday			2
and there 's still ground left to cover			0
the @entity57 has scanned more than 90 % of the underwater search area set out by investigators and began its 12th mission on thursday			1
" we will continue with the search operation until we fully cover the search area , " @entity87 , @entity88 's acting transport minister , said wednesday			1
despite the search efforts for @entity4 repeatedly coming up empty during the 48 days since it started , there 's no suggestion the hunt in the southern @entity42 is anywhere close to ending			1
quite to the contrary , according to @entity3 prime minister @entity77 , whose country is heading up the search for the missing aircraft			0
" we are not going to abandon ... the families of the 239 people who were on that plane by lightly surrendering while there is reasonable hope of finding something , " he said wednesday			0
" we may well rethink the search , but we will not rest until we have done everything we can to solve this mystery			0
" what comes next ? @entity88 and @entity3 authorities are already mapping out a long - term strategy for the search , which could go on for months or years , if the two - year search for @entity116 is any guide			0
guidelines drafted by @entity88 raise the possibility of a significantly wider search area should the current underwater search fail to turn up evidence of the plane			1
the document discusses how best to deploy resources , including new underwater search assets			0
if the underwater search comes up empty , it could ground the air search as well , @entity75 aviation analyst @entity127 said			1
" if it does n't pan out , then all the equations that have been put in the mix to determine where debris might be ... all of that is for naught , " he said			0
the next logical step after the underwater search is to " rethink all of the information we have at hand , " ocean search specialist @entity137 told @entity75			0
an expanded search area might include the last 370 miles of the plane 's flight path , perhaps 15 miles on either side , he said			1
he also said it would make sense to turn to deep - towed sonar , which provides less resolution than the @entity57 - 21 but about 10 times the range			2
if the search changes tacks , that does n't mean investigators did the wrong thing by looking where they did for the plane , said @entity75 analyst @entity161 , who co-led the search for @entity116			1
satellite and fuel consumption data , and possible pings from the plane 's flight data recorders led searchers to the part of the @entity42 they 're combing now , he said			0
" it 's the place they had to look			2
... everything pointed to this area , " he said			0
going forward , he said , investigators may double or triple the size of the search area while using sonar to map the ocean floor " so you see where every pebble is			1
" " i just do n't know how you leave this place before you take that area of the seafloor apart completely , " he said			1
what happens if data recorders are found ? investigators would love to find the flight data recorders from flight 370 , a potential treasure trove of information into what happened to the jetliner and the 239 passengers and crew on board			0
if found , the " black boxes " probably would go to the @entity199 's accident investigation lab. but the investigation is officially @entity88 , so that country 's officials would decide where the boxes would go			2
@entity3 is just one of a handful of countries that have the capability and technical know - how to decipher what 's inside a black box			0
the investigation into flight 370 's disappearance is @entity88 's responsibility			0
@entity3 is leading the search for the missing aircraft and participating in the investigation as an accredited representative			0
the @entity88 cabinet approved the appointment of an international investigation team to look into the disappearance of flight 370 , @entity87 said			0
the names of the members will be announced next week , he added			0
he also said the team will not be looking at the criminal aspects of the investigation , which remain under the @entity230			0
" the main purpose is to evaluate and determine the cause of the accident , " @entity87 said			0
@entity88 has completed a preliminary report on the incident , as required by the @entity236 , but has not released it publicly , he said			0
inside a black box investigation lab the latest in the search @entity3 : what 's next sad , angry relatives in agonizing limbo			2
