@entity0 is a magical place of natural wonder			0
it is on the @entity5 's southwest border with the @entity6 and is widely considered the most important gathering place for forest elephants in the entire @entity10 basin			0
for decades -- and probably centuries -- elephants by the hundreds from across the region have congregated there , reconnecting with family members and drinking the mineral - rich waters			0
last may , a group of heavily armed men , believed to be linked to the @entity22 rebel group , entered @entity0 and slaughtered a reported two dozen elephants			1
by the time @entity0 's elephant carcasses were discovered , the perpetrators were gone , leaving in their wake a horrific crime scene of heads carved up for their precious ivory			1
tusks like these , typically destined for @entity34 markets , where growing demand has quickly driven up prices , have in recent years presented a new opportunity for quick cash to finance the operations of armed gangs from the @entity5 east to @entity41			1
it is now widely understood that groups ranging from @entity45 's @entity44 to @entity47 's @entity46 have turned to this revenue source			0
the growth of these groups , with funds from illegal wildlife trafficking , is destabilizing @entity53 governments even as it devastates populations of elephants , rhinos and other high value wildlife			0
operating through terror and intimidation , roving rebel armies undermine democratic governance and responsible resource management while devastating regional economies through disruptions to tourism and local livelihoods			1
in meetings in the @entity69 , @entity34 and @entity70 this year , we have listened as leaders have shared their growing anxiety			2
the new poachers are tied to criminal syndicates			0
rifles and machetes have been enhanced or replaced with helicopters , night visions goggles , sophisticated telecommunications and automatic weapons			0
local communities are terrified and national governments fear losing large swaths of territory to these gangs			0
out of these conversations has emerged a challenge to the world â€” from @entity53 nations -- to stop buying ivory			2
representatives of the governments of @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 , along with the international nongovernmental organizations we represent , have gathered in @entity103 this week to announce an important commitment through the @entity105			0
together , we have three straightforward goals : ( 1 ) stop the killing ; ( 2 ) stop the trafficking ; and ( 3 ) stop the demand			0
to stop the killing and the trafficking , the international community can help states that make up the present range of the @entity53 elephant by providing equipment , training and expertise			1
president @entity120 recently dedicated $ 10 million for law enforcement efforts and the creation of a wildlife trafficking task force at the highest levels of the @entity69 government , complementing existing @entity69 initiatives			0
@entity129 and other nations , along with private citizens , need to join him in committing emergency resources to enforcement efforts in elephant landscapes and ivory trafficking ports			1
despite a ban on international trade in ivory imposed under the convention on @entity140 and @entity141 in 1989 , domestic sales remain legal in a number of countries , including the @entity69			2
because these legal markets can provide a front for laundering illegal ivory into the trade , moratoria on domestic sales of ivory are also a vital part of anti-trafficking efforts			2
stopping the demand requires new strategies			2
removing the prestige associated with buying ivory requires creative new uses of social media and other tools to change consumption behavior in @entity161 and elsewhere			2
once the demand for ivory is curtailed there will be little financial incentive for criminal groups to continue elephant poaching and trafficking			1
yet because carved ivory is a centuries - old cultural tradition , this change will take time -- something the world 's dwindling elephant populations do n't have			1
that is why @entity53 nations with the greatest remaining elephant populations have begun to call for nations across the globe to stop selling and purchasing ivory until all african elephant populations have recovered to healthy levels			1
the devastating poaching crisis that has gripped @entity70 over the past decade has left multiple tragedies in its wake : the loss of roughly three - quarters of all remaining @entity53 forest elephants ; the murder of hundreds of courageous wildlife guards ; regional government resources stretched to their limits as villagers across @entity70 live in daily terror			1
the initiative launched this week by representatives of elephant range states , ivory consumer nations , and our organizations has been endorsed by an unprecedented group of conservation partners that include the @entity204 , the @entity205 , the @entity206 , the @entity207 , the @entity208 , @entity209 , save the elephants , traffic , @entity212 , and @entity213			1
this effort is our best bet at saving these majestic , highly intelligent and socially complex creatures while bringing much - needed stability to governments whose hopes for a brighter future require that armed gangs no longer operate within their borders			1
before it 's too late , let 's stop the killing , stop the trafficking and stop the demand .			0
