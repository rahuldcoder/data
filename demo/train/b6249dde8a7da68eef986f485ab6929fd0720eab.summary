-- it was april 1975 when i was packed into a military transport plane with two of my siblings as the @entity6 ended			1
we left @entity8 to escape communist rule and eventually , take on an additional identity			1
i was 8 years old , and being separated from both parents for the first time in my life was confusing and scary			1
my mother decided to stay behind with my five remaining siblings to wait for my father to return			1
an officer in the @entity18 fighting alongside the @entity19 during the @entity6 , my father spent the next seven years in the communist prisons , which were euphemistically called " re-education camps			1
" it was many years later when our family was reunited			1
the challenges i faced growing up were probably not that different from the struggles all other immigrants face when they first arrive in the @entity19			1
i suppose most immigrants , regardless of origin , would have to deal with obstacles such as the language barrier and unfamiliar customs			1
i vividly remember small things like missing rice as the staple in my diet and bigger challenges , including loneliness and the sense of being displaced			1
i never imagined that one day i would think nothing of ordering gumbo or eating burritos , much less have a career in politics as the @entity19 congressman representing the 2nd @entity45			0
like most immigrants , my siblings and i learned to assimilate into this big melting pot called the @entity19			1
we worked hard on our studies and in our businesses			0
along with other @entity56 immigrants and refugees of the time , stories of successes and heartbreaks quickly spread around the community			0
although the academic achievements of @entity56 students in schools were touted in the media , we also agonized over the horrific news about the plights of the @entity56 boat people			0
facing persecution and hardship in the old country , @entity56 refugees braved the perilous seas aboard small fishing boats to seek freedom			0
many lost their lives to piracy , storm and starvation			0
the lucky ones who were able to land somewhere would face cold rejections by a world grown tired of having to deal with refugee problems			0
the boat people saga continued well into the 1990s			0
i volunteered with @entity85 , a national organization that advocates for the refugees			0
my experience with them shaped my path in the years to come			2
after graduating from @entity90 with a bachelor 's degree in physics , i joined the @entity93 for the priesthood			2
after working with some of the poorest communities in @entity97 countries , i decided that politics would bring about quicker changes for the less fortunate among us			2
i studied to be a lawyer , and while working as an immigration lawyer in @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity102 changed my life			1
the storm destroyed my home and office			2
like many in my @entity56 - @entity19 community in @entity104 , i came back to pick up the pieces after the storm			1
facing one obstacle after another , we fought as a community to rebuild our homes and lives			0
during our efforts to close a landfill the city and state had opened right next to our community , rep. @entity120 came to hear our complaint and did not find anyone from within the community in public office to advocate for ourselves			2
he asked : " who among you wants to run ? " i raised my hand and began a new course as a public servant			2
it has been 35 years since the first wave of @entity56 refugees landed on @entity19 soil			0
now things like pho and spring rolls have joined the @entity143 mainstream			0
i no longer see myself as a displaced stranger ; i am a @entity56 .			0
