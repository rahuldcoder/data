-- once called the " mad dog of the @entity4 , " @entity2 's often flamboyantly dressed ruler , @entity1 , has ruled the north @entity6 nation for 42 years			1
but @entity2 's 679,362 square miles and 6.4 million people have rarely seemed enough for @entity1 , who in 2008 gathered a group of @entity6 tribal leaders and had them grant him the lofty title , " @entity11			1
" it was part of his campaign for a unified @entity6 -- a single federation with a million - man army at its disposal -- a nation that he , naturally , would serve as president , said @entity21 , the author of seven books on @entity2			1
" the @entity2 stage is not enough of a playhouse for @entity1			1
it never has been , " @entity21 said			0
@entity1 's " @entity11 " ploy was only another in a string of efforts by the mercurial leader to secure a larger - than - life place for himself on the world stage , efforts that have frequently landed him and his citizens in the harsh glare of an angry international community , according to @entity31			1
@entity1 's growing anger over the rejection of @entity43 and @entity6 leaders and his own growing anti-western sentiment led him to turn to terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s , said @entity46 , a @entity2 expert at @entity47			1
it led to the infamous bombing of a @entity51 flight over @entity52 , @entity53 , in which 270 people died			0
" @entity55 was a cheap way to get even with the @entity56 , " @entity46 said			0
@entity1 , who will turn 69 in march , seized control of @entity2 in the very place where the current tumult seems strongest , the city of @entity61			1
as an @entity63 captain , he led a bloodless coup against @entity65 on september 1 , 1969 , establishing the @entity66 in just two hours , according to @entity67 , an independent provider of security information			1
he established a putative system of direct democracy called @entity71 that supposedly allowed the nation 's citizens direct input into their government , @entity21 said			0
in reality , the country was sliding into a dictatorship led by @entity1 , he said			2
in taking control of the country , he became one of a number of young revolutionaries in the region carrying a strong message of @entity43 nationalism in the mold of @entity89 president @entity88 , @entity46 said			0
although @entity92 leaders initially tried working with @entity1 , it quickly became clear he was an @entity43 nationalist and relations with the @entity56 quickly deteriorated , @entity21 said			2
by 1972 , he was urging muslims to fight @entity96 powers , including the @entity92 and @entity97 , and backing black militants in the @entity92 as he pursued a leadership position in the @entity43 world , seeking to succeed his political idol , @entity88 , who had died in 1972			0
but @entity43 leaders shunned his responses , @entity46 said , seeing him more as a " buffoon " and a " clown " than a potential @entity107 leader			0
that rejection , his own growing anti-western sentiment and a lack of criticism within the tightly controlled @entity2 political environment led @entity1 to turn to terrorism , @entity46 said			1
" i think it was frustration more than anything else , " he said			0
in 1986 , @entity2 was implicated in the fatal bombing at a @entity119 nightclub that left one @entity92 service member dead , prompting @entity92 president @entity121 to dub the @entity2 leader the " mad dog of the @entity4			2
" the @entity92 bombed targets in @entity2 in response and imposed economic sanctions			2
two years later , @entity2 was implicated in the 1988 bombing of @entity128 , which exploded over @entity52 , @entity53			1
in 1999 , seeking rapprochement with the @entity56 , @entity1 succumbed to @entity96 demands to turn over suspects in the @entity52 bombing , and in 2003 the country agreed to eliminate weapons of mass destruction			2
the moves helped the country regain diplomatic relations with the @entity92 in 2006 , but that was n't the end of @entity1 's touchy relations with foreign nations			2
in 2008 , @entity144 officials jailed one of @entity1 's sons , prompting the furious leader to cut off the country 's oil supplies , withdraw the country 's money from @entity144 banks and threaten to cut off diplomatic relations			2
and in 2009 , @entity2 and @entity1 again became the subject of international ire in 2009 when the government granted a hero 's welcome to @entity158 , who had been convicted in the @entity52 bombing but was released by @entity53 authorities for health reasons			1
while his politics have brought the attention of international leaders , it may be @entity1 's personal style that has brought him the most awareness around the world			1
@entity1 is known for appearing in public in outrageous , sometimes outlandish , garb , @entity21 said			0
images of the @entity2 leaders available on the @entity172 show him dressed in everything from lavishly decorated military uniforms to animal prints			1
@entity1 famously travels with a traditional @entity177 tent , whose appearance in 2009 frustrated officials in @entity180 , @entity181 , when he came to @entity181 to address the @entity182			0
he also travels with a retinue of female bodyguards , @entity21 noted			0
while @entity1 has a substantial number of enemies within @entity2 , his use of the county 's enormous oil revenues to provide subsidized health care , education and housing to citizens , as well as his willingness to stand up to the @entity56 , granted him a reserve of good will that he still draws on today , said @entity46			1
" this was a young nationalist who stood up to the @entity56 , who nationalized the oil companies , who stood up to @entity97 and the @entity92 , " @entity46 said			0
" it was highly symbolic and there are a number of people there who still grudgingly respect him for that			0
" @entity0 's @entity208 contributed to this report			0

@entity1 has ruled @entity2 for 42 years
he took control in a bloodless coup with *fellow* military officers in 1969
his efforts at a larger world role have often brought harsh international attention to his nation
