the first - time visitor quickly notices the pretty pastel houses and curious sculptures placed at intervals throughout the town -- but the quaint facades and works of modern art signal merely the tip of the fascinating story behind a little known hillside labyrinth in @entity12 known as @entity14 village			1
not on any standard travel itinerary , the village offers a stark contrast from the glitzy skyscrapers of " new @entity12 " or even the bustling markets of " old @entity12			1
" instead , the eerily quiet village is a destination for a different type of traveler -- one that 's not driven by foodie discovery or lazing on the beach , the primary reasons @entity29 vacation in @entity12			1
instead , @entity30 lures travelers with an interest in art and history			2
religious roots the village has an unusual origin story			1
many accounts say @entity30 began as a slum town in the 1950s filled with refugees from the aftermath of the @entity42 , but the village actually owes its beginnings to an ascetic religious community called @entity46 , an obscure religion birthed during political upheavals in @entity48 in the early 1900s			1
although relatively scarce today , members of the @entity46 religion believe that the meaning of the universe can be found through a philosophy of " great polarity , " which incorporates the concepts of yin and yang			1
the swirling blue and red @entity60 symbol has been important throughout @entity48 's history -- it 's the symbol in the center of today 's @entity48 flag			2
in 1955 , during the rebuilding phase that followed the @entity42 , the city of @entity12 ordered some 800 families of the religious movement to move into designated area on a nearby hillside			1
the religion 's headquarters also moved			1
it remains the preeminent landmark of the village today			2
meaningful layout , artistic rebirth unlike other area villages that sprang up in ad hoc fashion , @entity30 's multi-tiered communal layout was meticulously planned			2
" by building the houses in tiers so that no house blocks any house behind it , the architectural layout of the village adheres to the @entity46 teaching of allowing others to prosper , " says @entity80 - young , a local representative of the @entity46 religion			1
@entity30 's art - themed makeover began in 2009 , when it hosted a public art project and invited art students and artists to " decorate " the village			1
while the villagers had for decades painted their own homes in pastel hues , artists added dozens of colorful touches throughout town , attaching nicknames such as " @entity48 's @entity104 " ( bizarre choice ) and " @entity48 's @entity106 " ( closer )			1
while the view is best from a high vantage point called " @entity110 , " where the village information center is located ( only @entity48 brochures and guides are available ) , the real delight lies in getting lost in the village 's maze of alleyways			1
each alley leads to a different surprise , from bird sculptures on roofs to @entity122 - like playful installations in abandoned houses			2
the quirkiest surprise is " @entity132 , " from the @entity126 novel of the same name , sitting atop a fence , staring forlornly out at the @entity129 alongside his fox			0
getting around it 's almost impossible not to get lost			2
each alley leads to three or four others			0
one way to maintain your bearings is to " follow the fish " -- painted schools that " swim " throughout the streets			2
look closely and you 'll spot tiny people sitting on top of the fish , or kicking them in the eye			0
" photographers come and fall head over heels in love with the village , " says in @entity148 , a local tour guide			0
" but the villagers do n't like the fact that so many people are traipsing through their houses , and many of them are moving away			0
the houses do n't sell though , so they just abandon them			0
" more than 300 local houses are estimated to be empty			0
artists are stepping in to turn many of them into exhibition spaces			0
some have been transformed into cafes and restaurants run by the town			0
profits go back to the villagers			0
small , quiet and mostly hidden from the tourist path , @entity30 is n't ready for a flood of visitors			0
it prefers the occasional trickle that it has today			0
" i do n't think fat foreigners can fit through these alleyways , " says another guide when asked about tours for foreigners			0
" they 'll have to watch their heads every step , too			0
it 'll be very uncomfortable			0
" how to get there in @entity12 , take the subway to @entity189 or @entity190 , then take a taxi to @entity192 ( taxi will cost approximately $ 2.50 )			1
