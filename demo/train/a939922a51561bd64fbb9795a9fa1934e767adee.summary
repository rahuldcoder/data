-- with the season of backyard barbecues upon us , we thought you could use a history lesson on everyone 's favorite lawn ornament			1
from the plastic bird 's birth to its modern perch atop the pyramid of campy @entity13 , here 's the quick - and - dirty on the hot pink queen of kitsch			2
birth of a national icon perhaps not shockingly , the pink flamingo lawn ornament was invented in the same decade that polyester pants , pink washing machines , vinyl wallpaper and @entity23 lounge chairs were cool			2
@entity25 fans worldwide owe their thanks to a man named @entity28 a one - time employee of a plastics company called @entity31 , who designed the first pink flamingo lawn ornament in 1957			1
when they first hit stores , the blushing birds cost $ 2.76 a pair and were an immediate hit in working - class subdivisions from the @entity38 to the @entity40 waters			0
this bird was made for you and me			0
a ( brief ) fall from grace the 1960s were a decade of backlash against conformity , false experience , and all things parental -- including , evidently , @entity50 and @entity52 's lawn décor			2
hippies rallied against the plastics industry , cultural critics chastised all things " un-natural , " and home and garden magazines pleaded with people to abandon the gnomes , lawn jockeys and flamingos of yesteryear in favor of classier , more natural yard décor			1
by 1970 , even @entity66 had stopped selling the pink flamingo , replacing the gaping hole in their garden department with natural - looking fountains and rocks , according to the historian @entity72			1
her book , " @entity75 " ( @entity76 , 1999 ) , has a chapter on the plastic flamingo			0
it 's a must - read for flamingo aficionados			1
mental @entity81 : itsy - bitsy bikini trivia and she 's back ! happily for flamingo fans , the ' 70s were a carnival of schlock , and by the early part of the decade , the pink flamingo had become so un-cool , it was cool again -- this time as a self - conscious symbol of rebellion , outrageousness and all things @entity94			1
by the time @entity98 ' movie , @entity97 , hit theaters in 1972 , the bird had fully transitioned to the realm of ironic kitsch			0
gay bars used them as mascots , transvestites sported them on earrings and platform pumps , and in 1979 , students from the @entity111 planted 1,008 of the two - legged creatures in the grass in front of the dean 's office , earning them -- and the bird -- a place in @entity120 's @entity119			1
mental @entity81 : @entity123 envelope art @entity124 is the new art by the 1980s , the pink flamingo had made the ultimate giant leap for mankind : it had , like @entity131 's @entity130 , become art. in 1987 , the governor of @entity127 proclaimed the plastic bird " an essential contribution to @entity136 folk art , " @entity72 wrote , and new clubs like the @entity138 of @entity136 and the @entity139 for the @entity140 sprang into existence in time to celebrate the bird 's thirtieth birthday			0
in 1998 , the @entity144 in @entity145 began to sell plastic pink flamingos in its bookstore for $ 19 a set			0
long live the @entity149 in 2009 , in honor of the students ' 1979 prank , the @entity151 , @entity120 , city council named the plastic pink flamingo the official bird of the city			2
and the esteemed lawn ornament lives on in @entity13 infamy , lending its name to bars , restaurants , casinos and hotels from sea to shining sea			0
