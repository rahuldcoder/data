@entity0 -- a @entity3 teenager with a shy , crooked smile and expressive eyebrows -- who also happens to be the first figure skater ever to represent a @entity8 country -- qualified for the free skate after his performance on thursday			1
@entity12 , the lone athlete for the @entity3 , is an unlikely competitor from a country without snow			1
catapulted into the limelight after qualifying last year , his entire home country , which has never won a medal in the @entity17 , is rooting for him			0
on thursday , he finished 19th overall with a total segment score of 64.81 which means he 'll move on to friday 's final free skate			0

" i do n't know what placement i 'll get because my training is so different , but we 'll see			2
" it 's likely to be a @entity33 - versus - @entity32 match - up			0
facing medal favorites such as @entity36 's @entity35 and @entity38 's @entity37 , who rank first and second after the short program , @entity12 has not benefited from the same intensive training as many of his competitors			1
@entity43 , his mother , said her son had full training for two months before arriving in @entity46 because of difficulties funding his @entity49 aspirations			1
ice skating is a costly endeavor with expenses for travel , equipments and coaches			2
his mother told @entity1 in an email that the family patched together donations from a local shopping mall ice rink , friends and his skating club			1
she said the family 's life saving has been depleted and that their family 's farm in @entity70 province had been damaged by typhoons last year			0
if @entity12 had n't qualified for the @entity17 in 2013 , he would 've had to quit competitive skating because his family could n't afford it , his mother added			1
" now that he qualified , we are hoping we can finally get support so he can continue , and try to qualify again in 2018 , where he will be more matured and more ready physically and mentally , " she wrote			0
regardless of how he fares this week , @entity12 has come a long way			2
born in @entity79 , @entity12 was stricken with asthmatic bronchitis at two months old			1
as a young boy , he struggled with sports because of his asthma attacks			0
" i could n't take up any sport			0
i tried outdoor sports when i was younger , but i easily got asthma attacks so i stopped , " he said in his @entity49 athletes profile			2
" i had asthma maintenance medicine when i started skating , since the cold in the rink makes me sick too			1
but year after year , my health keeps improving , so my mother fully supported me to continue skating			2
she said it 's better to spend the money on skating than in the hospital			0
" he got his first glimpse of skating after going to a shopping mall with his mother at age 8			1
he became mesmerized when he saw skaters spinning and jumping			0
by age 12 , he was competing in @entity104 junior competitions and winning gold without a coach , his mother said			0
in 2010 , he began training in the @entity107 with coaches including @entity109 and @entity110 , she said			0

in 2013 , he came in fifth at the world @entity115 in @entity116			0
he is currently ranked 30th by the @entity117			0
@entity12 does not have a dedicated practice rink in the @entity3 and has to use a public one , his mother said			1
in late january , @entity12 nursed an inflamed knee , saying it was likely caused by skating on rough ice , according to an interview with @entity123			1
