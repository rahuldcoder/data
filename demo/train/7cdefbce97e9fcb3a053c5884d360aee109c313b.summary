-- the suicide death of @entity2 has generated interest in the relationship between creativity and depression			1
no one knows the nature of mr. @entity10 's problems ( added to them today was the revelation that he was suffering with early stage @entity13 ) , but the possibility of a link between " madness " and creativity is ancient and persistent			0
it is also controversial ; some believe that making such a link romanticizes painful , potentially lethal illnesses and ignores the diversity of temperament and imagination that is essential to artistic work as a pathology			0
the evidence for such a link , however , especially between bipolar disorder and creativity , is strong and growing			1
many biographical studies , as well as studies of living artists , writers , and musicians have found higher rates of mania , severe depression , and suicide in creative individuals			1
first - degree relatives ( that is , a parent , offspring or sibling ) of creative people with bipolar disorder or depression also have elevated rates of both mood disorders and creative accomplishment			1
opinion : why @entity2 lost to depression in the past five years alone there have been four large studies ( one that reported on 20,000 individuals and three others , each of which studied more than 700,000 individuals ) , that found that those with bipolar illness were disproportionately likely to be overrepresented in creative occupations ; so too were their first - degree relatives			1
additionally , the first - degree relatives of people with schizophrenia , although not those with schizophrenia , were more likely to be in creative occupations			0
going public with depression mood , temperament , behavioral and cognitive factors associated with bipolar illness can , in some people , make them more creative by increasing the fluency and originality of their thinking , as well as by increasing risk - taking , ambition , energy , exuberance and a desire to create meaning from suffering and chaos			1
it must be emphasized that most creative people do not have a mental illness and most people who have mental illnesses , such as bipolar disorder , are not unusually creative			1
it is rather that there is a disproportionate rate of mood disorders , especially bipolar disorder , in creative individuals			0
untreated bipolar disorder is a painful illness that is associated with a very high rate of alcohol and drug abuse , as well as suicide			2
opinion : suicide does n't set you free it is a common illness and it usually first hits at a young age			0
fortunately , treatment works and allows people to continue their creative work			0
i have had bipolar illness since i was 17 years old			0
it is a difficult illness and it nearly cost me my life , as it does tens of thousands of people every year			2
there is nothing romantic about psychosis , depression or suicide			2
the death of @entity2 , who was admired and loved by so many , makes this clear .			0

@entity124 : @entity2 suicide has raised issue of link between creativity and depression
she says studies show bipolar people disproportionately represented in creative jobs
she says some who are bipolar are fluent , original thinkers eager to create meaning from chaos
but , she says most creative people not mentally ill. this illness not romantic , so difficult
