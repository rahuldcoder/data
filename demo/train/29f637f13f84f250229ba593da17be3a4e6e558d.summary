-- " @entity1 , " based on the true story of an ambushed navy seal team in @entity4 , was the no. 1 movie in @entity6 last weekend			0
if you have n't seen it , go see it			0
the movie reminded me of a phrase , " citizenship on the cheap , " which has haunted me since i heard retired @entity14 gen. @entity13 utter it last summer			0
he was launching the @entity18 , an ambitious initiative to expand national service in @entity6			1
but he was talking about something deeper -- the widening divide between civilians and those coming out of the military			2
because the @entity28 and @entity4 wars have been fought by an all - volunteer force , the great majority of @entity6 have only passing acquaintance with the sacrifices of national defense			1
most americans have not been asked to do anything more for their country during wartime than to thank the troops			0
that 's why @entity13 has called for a rapid expansion of voluntary civilian service programs like @entity41 , so more civilians join those who serve in uniform			1
i could n't agree more			0
i 'd go further , in fact , and mandate national service , whether military or civilian			1
that , however , is a pipe dream when our nation ca n't even fully tolerate mandatory health insurance coverage			0
how , then , can @entity6 society aspire to something greater than citizenship on the cheap ? perhaps the answer lies not in trying to make more americans serve but in enabling more veterans to serve in new ways when they come home			1
there are more than 2.6 million @entity28 and @entity4 veterans today			2
as our country 's longest wars wind down , a million more are expected to return			2
these are people with leadership skills , professionalism , experiences solving complex problems under high stress while keeping a larger mission in mind			0
think @entity6 could use a few ( million ) good men and women like that ? meet two of them , @entity80 and @entity81			0
@entity82 is military parlance for " got your back " and @entity81 , a former @entity86 pilot , founded this national campaign to bridge the military - civilian divide			1
it activates celebrities , social media , political and cultural leaders , and every other resource available to advance a simple message : veterans are assets			2
but consider the two dominant images of veterans in everyday culture , from movie screens to school assemblies to corporate advertising			1
the other is the victim			2
the hero narrative portrays veterans as @entity109 winners with superhuman courage , amputees undaunted by their disabilities , and , yes , lone survivors of hellish battles			1
the victim story portrays veterans as sufferers of post-traumatic stress disorder , wounded warriors betrayed by bureaucracy , combat leaders now left homeless and jobless			1
to be clear , both narratives have a basis in reality			0
more veterans than can be counted have indeed been damaged by war , and more than can be counted are indeed heroes of war			2
they have earned every bit of support , care , honor and gratitude we offer them -- and often more			0
but the hero and victim portrayals emphasize two messages : that vets belong on a pedestal , and that vets need your compassion			1
the veterans i know are looking for a third message : vets can be great citizens back home			1
consider @entity153 , from @entity154 , a @entity156 veteran who in the crowded years since his deployments has gone to graduate school , started businesses , led @entity154 's expansion to many hundreds of campuses nationwide , and helped run a state veterans affairs department			1
the question for civilians is how to create more channels for people like @entity153 to continue being contributors and leaders in public service -- not as pilots or infantry commanders but as candidates for office or school principals or heads of nonprofits			0
how we do this is simple			0
we foster relationships between veterans and civilians			0
we hire , connect , mentor and invest in veterans			1
we support organizations like @entity185 and @entity186 that plug veterans into community service			1
we learn from them about how to show up for others			0
it 's often said that " freedom is n't free			0
so is great citizenship , and so is deep gratitude			0
if we truly want to thank veterans for their service , let 's make sure each one who returns from war is empowered to be an integrated , vital part of their community 's social fabric and civic life			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			2

@entity210 : the two dominant images of veterans in everyday culture are hero or victim
**liu** : veterans want to be known for being great citizens back home
he says we should hire , connect , mentor , empower and invest more in veterans
**liu** : let 's also consider mandating national service , whether military or civilian
