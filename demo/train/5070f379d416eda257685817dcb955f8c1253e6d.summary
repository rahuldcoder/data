-- in most presidential races this close , it is a battle for the undecideds and independents			2
pre-convention interviews with both @entity9 and @entity10 delegates suggest this year might be more like trench warfare -- firing up the party faithful , starting in @entity13 and @entity14 , to mobilize a high grassroots voter turnout in november			1
" conventional wisdom is that this election is about independents , but in reality it 's about the base , " said @entity16 , a @entity18 - based longtime @entity17 activist attending her first convention as part of a state delegation			1
" for republicans , it means the convention is that much more important this time around			0
our base has to be energized leaving @entity13 , because we have to do everything we can not only to elect @entity17 , but to win the @entity33 and gain greater control of the @entity35			1
" like president @entity38 , @entity37 councilman @entity36 launched his political career as an inner - city community activist			1
he says the mission is no different for @entity42			0
" i 'm a grassroots organizer at heart			2
... you 've got to make sure you get everyone at every level involved , all pushing the same message , " he said			0
" we want to make sure we go block by block , house by house , door by door , to make sure we get every vote possible			0
" @entity58 loyalists say ' we can do better ' that view is echoed by @entity18 @entity10 delegate @entity60 , minority leader of the @entity33			0
" you better be on your p 's and q 's on @entity64 and make sure your people are coming , " he said			0
" @entity66 's a concern in every state for both parties			0
you 've got to get your people to the polls			0
" @entity9 liken this year 's race to 1980 when the contrasts between the two candidates -- @entity73 and then - president @entity74 -- were just as stark			2
@entity38 , @entity17 : no more niceness but some analysts say the more apt comparison is 2004 when the incumbent , @entity9 @entity80 , " was as much of a lightning rod as president @entity38 is today , " as chief @entity0 pollster @entity81 put it			1
" this is not an election where you are trying to persuade independents , " @entity81 said			1
" the selection of @entity88 is evidence of this			0
... the @entity88 pick was a base election strategy			1
" @entity88 's selection was heartily applauded by @entity94 , the @entity95 - based national coordinator of @entity96			0
" i did n't think @entity17 would be bold or courageous enough to pick @entity88 as his running mate , " she said			1
" that signals the direction he 's going in			0
he 's not trying to run away from some of the statements @entity88 has made in regards to @entity105 and some of the other issues			2
" before @entity17 picked @entity88 , some conservatives seemed to be more anti-obama than @entity108			1
a similar situation existed in 2004 , with republicans occupying the @entity35			2
" with all respect to @entity116 , the party was united against @entity80 , " recalled @entity112 @entity10 chairman @entity111 , who is going to his sixth convention , this time as a so - called " super-delegate			1
" " he ran as a compassionate conservative in 2000			0
that went out the door with tax cuts for the rich and two wars he paid for with credit cards			0
" opinion : what @entity9 needs to do in @entity13 @entity128 @entity9 delegate @entity127 is a @entity129 reservist who served in @entity130 after working in the @entity131 and later at the @entity132 as associate deputy general counsel			0
@entity134 went to his first convention in 1980 , as chairman of @entity128 's @entity137 and a supporter of dark horse presidential candidate @entity139 , the senator from @entity141 who achieved fame by asking " what did the president know , and when did he know it ? " during the @entity145 that brought down @entity146			2
" it was a convention i went to believing in a man who really did n't get very far in the presidential race , and i left as an advocate for @entity73 , " he says			0
of this year 's contest , @entity134 says : " in my lifetime , i think this is probably the most important presidential election we 've ever had			2
there 's two very different visions of @entity159 offered by governor @entity17 and president @entity38			1
what 's at stake is the free enterprise system as it has been articulated during the history of this country			0
" president @entity38 stands for more government , less freedom and less personal responsibility			1
governor @entity17 stands for free enterprise , less government , more freedom			1
" two @entity10 delegates from @entity173 stressed the importance of @entity38 's appeal to minorities and young people , voter blocs that were pivotal for him four years ago			1
" i think the outcome of the election may very well be determined by the number of young people who come out to vote , " said @entity180 , 21 , director of political affairs for @entity42 , a first - time voter herself in 2008			2
" i think we can either choose to re-elect our president and continue to make progress or we can go back to the last decade and its failed policies			1
" @entity192 , a @entity193 - @entity159 small business owner , ran for @entity194 on the ticket with @entity38 in 2008 but lost to popular @entity197 - born rep. @entity196 in south @entity173			1
a longtime party activist , she was cheered by @entity38 's decision to exempt from deportation children of illegal immigrants who pursue a college education , his endorsement of same - sex marriage and the party 's proposed platform plank embracing that position			1
of @entity38 's runs for the presidency , @entity192 says , " the first time it was historic ; this time it 's personal because the attacks have been so personal -- frankly , below the belt -- throughout his presidency			2
" @entity218 was n't good enough even though it 's the same as @entity219 just because it came from his mouth			0
" @entity94 , who stresses fiscal conservatism over social issues , says tea party get - out - the - vote efforts are focused on @entity33 , congressional and local contests			0
" if we get people out for those races , those people are going to vote for @entity17 , " she says			2
" we feel @entity18 is a red state so the @entity96 and @entity95 @entity232 are sending people to @entity173 , maybe @entity234 , some of the other battleground states , to help there			0
" @entity81 , the @entity0 pollster , says it all gets down to the grassroots			1
" the @entity9 conventional wisdom is the @entity38 coalition from 2008 was a coalition of people who are known for not voting , " he said			2
" so they believe if they motivate their base and @entity38 tries to mobilize his base , he will fall short			1
" @entity111 , the @entity112 @entity10 chairman , disagrees with that scenario			0
" i think there really is respect and affection for the president for all the things he 's done under the circumstances , " he said			0
" and then we look at the alternative -- @entity17 and the tea party @entity137 and all the things they would roll back , overturn and repeal			1

@entity17 activist : election not about independents but about the party base
this election is like 2004 where @entity80 " was as much of a lightning rod as president @entity38 is today "
@entity0 pollster : it all gets down to grassroots
@entity273 : election is about looking at the progress made and then realizing that progress could be rolled back
