weeks after a grand jury chose not to indict the officer who shot @entity4 , officials have released a new mound of documents from the weeks of proceedings			2
they include more witness interviews , an autopsy conducted by a @entity11 medical examiner , as well as radio communications from the day of the shooting , which @entity2 has reported on previously			1
the documents do not seem to shed any new light on the events that led to officer @entity16 shooting @entity4			0
on november 24 , the day the grand jury 's decision was announced , the @entity18 prosecutor 's office released thousands of documents from the proceedings			1
among the details that emerged : @entity16 fired his gun 12 times ; the officer said he feared @entity4 could beat him to death ; and @entity16 said he was not carrying a stun gun because " it is not the most comfortable thing			0
" the latest document release does not include one notable element : the @entity35 interview with witness @entity36 , @entity4 's friend who was with him at the time of his shooting			1
despite the promises of @entity18 prosecutor @entity40 , who had promised to make all witness testimony in the case public , @entity40 's office told @entity2 affiliate @entity44 that it has kept some records secret at the request of federal authorities , who are still investigating the incident			1
executive assistant @entity50 said the office had " turned over and relinquished control " of the @entity35 's interview , according to @entity54			2
he said the @entity35 asked the county not to release records that are part of an ongoing federal civil rights probe			0
what @entity16 told the @entity60 grand jury the @entity11 autopsy found that @entity4 's multiple gunshot wounds included one in the right hand at close range			2
those findings are similar to previous autopsy results			0
