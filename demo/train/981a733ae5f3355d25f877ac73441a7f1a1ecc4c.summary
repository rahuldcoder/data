what kind of holiday rental home costs $ 10,000 a day ? perhaps one set on a private @entity4 beach , with a personal fleet of boats ? an @entity8 chalet , with postcard - perfect views of the @entity10 from every window ? or maybe a personal spa , with a lap pool , hiking trails , a state - of - the - art gym -- and an on - call personal trainer to make sure you use them ? the answer : yes , yes and yes			1
for today 's new generation of well - heeled travelers -- who are increasingly eschewing hotels for private rental villas -- the bar for luxe hideaways has reached dizzying heights			0
@entity27 : see more over-the - top villas for a certain breed of jet - setter , home theaters , @entity33 - worthy kitchens and private bars stocked with top - shelf liquor are all de rigueur ; what they 're after are award - winning chefs ready to whip up personalized dinner - party menus or on - demand yachts with captains who know the best deep - sea fishing spots			1
somewhat ironically , this surge in over-the - topness could be considered a by - product of harder economic times			1
" before the global financial crisis there was a glut of high - end construction , " explains @entity47 , founder of @entity48 , a network of villa rental websites representing 650,000 properties with prices ranging from a few hundred dollars up to $ 392,000 a week			0
" many owners of luxury properties who were over-leveraged have now turned to rentals as a way to defray ownership costs			0
" the result is a super competitive market where added extras like sports cars and ski equipment are as common as evening turndown treats in hotels			0
while many of the world 's most opulent villas lure guests with an array of cool toys ( and we do mean cool -- how does recording studio equipment once used by @entity79 sound ? ) , others deal in what may be the most coveted holiday - home currency : privacy			0
@entity27 : top yoga retreats is it any wonder that rock stars and royals duck the paparazzi by hiding out on islands like @entity90 and @entity91 ( particularly when there are homes like @entity94 -- set alone on a cloistered estate and reminiscent of a @entity97 imperial palace , koi pond included ) ? of course , for those seeking true sanctuary , the right vacation villa is only part of the equation ; the right staff is also key			1
( after all , a @entity106 stove is n't much use if you 're a terrible cook ; and 17,000 square feet seems like a lot , when you have to vacuum it yourself			0
) that 's why many top - tier villas come with phalanxes of personnel and also offer private transport -- via luxury car , boat or helicopter -- to zip guests anyplace they desire			2
but , really , when your home away from home is as outrageously opulent as these villas , why go anywhere else ? @entity123 , @entity124 sequestered behind ornately carved wooden doors ( rescued from a 250 - year - old @entity128 temple ) , the 20,000 - square - foot @entity125 evokes a @entity130 teak palace -- with a few exceptions			0
one is its location , on five private acres of @entity135 beachfront on @entity124 's @entity136 ; another is the 120 - foot - long infinity pool that anchors five luxurious suites , including one styled like an air - conditioned safari tent			0
@entity27 : @entity142 's top walking cities yet another is the fleet of go - go gadgets that comes with the property , including four top - of - the - line @entity147 ( capable of reaching 70 mph ) , two golf carts , two @entity150 all terrain vehicles , a customized @entity151 and a deep - sea fishing yacht with a captain			2
the only downside : you might have to bring your own @entity156 for the private airfield			0
@entity158 @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 this 17,000 - square - foot , six - bedroom mountain lodge has views over the wild snowshoe terrain of @entity160 's @entity165 from nearly every window			1
there 's an entry room with soaring vaulted ceilings , exposed beams , stone walls and a huge welcoming hearth ; outside , there 's a 60 - foot - long infinity pool , hot tub and a colonnaded stone porch with its own massive fireplace -- perfect for evening toddies or marshmallow roasts			0
@entity27 : a global guide to vacation villas ski lift passes and in - house ski and boot fittings are provided			1
if there 's a vintage you ca n't find in your pre-stocked wine cellar , engage the services of @entity159 's personal butler			1
@entity193 @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 this five - bedroom ski chalet has possibly the most iconic mountain views in the world ; almost every room overlooks the jagged peak of the @entity10			2
inside , the house has been customized to provide the ultimate in pre-and apr√®s - ski comfort			2
there 's the state - of - the - art @entity207 stone and @entity210 marble kitchen , outfitted with @entity212 and @entity213 appliances ; a walk - in wine cellar ; a sprawling leather @entity218 sectional , big enough to sleep three or four extra guests ; both bio-fire and natural - log fireplaces ; a full gym ; boot warmers and a drying room for top - of - the - line ski equipment ; and ice - climbing gear , in case you fancy tackling @entity228 's most iconic peak			1
best of all , though , is the quartz and crystal - tiled steam room , which purportedly helps speed healing after a challenging day on the slopes			0
@entity233 @entity94 , @entity91 on an island already famous for its over-the - top exclusivity ( @entity242 has a holiday home here , and prince @entity237 and @entity238 came to celebrate her 30th birthday ) , the @entity97 ryokan - style @entity234 , which is 9,000 square feet , stands alone for its outlandish opulence			1
the house , built on five bucolic cliff - side acres on the western saddle of the island in 1980 -- and newly renovated this year -- is a showcase for @entity97 art and antiques , and sports two swimming pools , a private putting green , three vehicles ( one @entity150 jeep and two open " mules " ) and a game - fishing powerboat			2
each of the nine silk - upholstered , shoji - screened bedrooms is named for a @entity97 flower ; most look over a 1,000 - square - foot central pond , stocked with a small fortune 's worth of koi			0
mustique - @entity265 @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 a 40 - minute ride in a private helicopter brings guests from @entity272 to the 1,500 - acre @entity266 estate , set along the @entity274 between a three - mile - long stretch of coastline and the @entity277			1
as well as a luxury resort , the property is home to @entity266 , an elite hideaway set into a cliff overlooking pristine @entity283			1
@entity284 -- aptly named , with stone towers that resemble something out of medieval @entity287 -- contains five suites scattered among three separate buildings			0
the main castle has two living rooms with wood - burning fireplaces , a bar stocked with @entity268 wines , a full gymnasium , an infinity pool , a ten - seat dining table ( with private chef ) and magnificent views over white sand and the @entity301			2
