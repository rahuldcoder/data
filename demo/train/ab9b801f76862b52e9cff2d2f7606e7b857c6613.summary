@entity0 , @entity1 -- eyewitnesses in the embattled @entity1 city of @entity5 reported especially intense shelling by @entity8 's forces overnight -- the heavy fire picking up at about the same time reports came out that one of the leader 's son was killed in a @entity15 airstrike			1
" there 's been continuous and heavy shelling for three hours straight , " said one man , talking to @entity2 from about three miles from @entity5 's city center sunday			1
" there have been a lot of explosions			0
" heavy gun and artillery fire could also be heard early sunday throughout @entity0 , which is the hub for rebel forces and their transitional government			1
the eyewitness in @entity5 , the country 's third - largest city , speculated that the intensified attacks were tied directly to reports that @entity32 , the sixth of @entity8 's eight children , died in an attack on his @entity37 home			1
he said there was significant damage and some casualties , though there were only rebel forces and none aligned with @entity8 in the city itself			1
government spokesman @entity46 said that several of the @entity1 leader 's grandchildren also died in the attack , though @entity8 and his wife -- both of whom were in the residence when it was hit -- are unhurt			1
" it 's going to be like revenge , " said the witness in @entity5 , who supports the opposition , of the intensified attacks			1
these stepped - up , continuous attacks were reported early sunday , about a full day after @entity8 's latest diatribe that called for a negotiated end to @entity15 airstrikes and included threats to @entity63			1
during his rambling 45 - minute speech , he urged @entity15 to negotiate an end to airstrikes , accusing the international coalition of killing civilians and destroying the nation 's infrastructure in a bid to take over its oil production			1
" come and negotiate with us			0
you are the ones attacking us			0
you are the ones terrifying our kids and destroying our infrastructure			0
you @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 come and negotiate with us , " @entity8 said on @entity1 state tv			2
the @entity1 leader remained defiant , as he sharply criticized those behind the attacks and questioned their intent			0
" what are you trying to do ? trying to take the oil ? " he said			0
" the @entity1 people will not allow you ... the oil is under control of the @entity1 government and for the people			0
" he called on the @entity96 to review the @entity15 attacks , saying his country agreed to a cease - fire			1
" we are the first ones who wanted and agreed on a cease - fire			0
but the @entity15 crusader airstrike did not cease , " he said			2
" it can not be a cease - fire from one side			0
" hours later but before reports of @entity32 's death , the head of @entity15 rebuffed the @entity1 leader 's comments , insisting that the mission to target his forces will continue as long as civilians remain under fire			1
@entity15 secretary - general @entity118 " reject ( ed ) any threat against @entity63 or any other ally , " while vowing that the coalition would continue to pursue its mission			1
" the @entity8 regime continues to cause widespread suffering through its attacks on the @entity1 population			2
quite simply , this must stop , " @entity118 said in a statement			0
" @entity15 remains firm -- we will continue our operation until the threat to the civilian population of @entity1 is removed			1
" the airstrikes started after the @entity132 approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary to protect civilians demanding the ouster of the ruler , who has been in power for nearly 42 years			0
from the time @entity15 began its operation on march 31 , the organization had conducted 4,398 sorties , of which 1,821 were strike sorties , according to an update issued saturday			1
facilities in or around @entity37 , @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 were targeted on friday , it said			0
shortly after @entity8 's speech , a @entity15 spokeswoman called for actions , not words , in expressing skepticism the @entity1 leader could be trusted to follow through on his pledges			1
" the regime has announced cease - fires several times before and continued attacking cities and civilians , " @entity15 deputy spokeswoman @entity156 said in a statement			2
" just hours before col. @entity8 spoke of a truce , his forces indiscriminately shelled @entity5 , killing many people , including children			1
his forces tried to mine the port to block the access of humanitarian aid to the beleaguered civilians of @entity5			2
all this has to stop , and it has to stop now			0
" a spokesman for the @entity1 opposition accused @entity8 of lying and trying to play both sides			2
" he 's playing both parts			0
he 's buying time at the same time projecting himself as somebody who 's trying to find a solution to this problem , while the reality on the ground is he is the one who 's seeking to kill and carry out all kind of crimes against the @entity1 people , " said @entity177			0
" the man has no credibility anymore , " he added			0
this back - and - forth came as eyewitnesses reported difficult conditions in @entity5 , amid intense shelling and blockage of any assistance			2
@entity46 said no ships can " dock at the port without being inspected by the @entity1 government , " saying any aid must go through designated land routes			0
the @entity1 governmentthreatened to sink any ship approaching the besieged port city of @entity5			2
the declaration essentially threatens @entity15 patrols and humanitarian aid ships that have been bringing in food and medical supplies , and ferrying out refugees and the wounded			0
this threat came shortly after @entity15 said it intercepted government forces laying mines in @entity5 's harbor , which has been a lifeline for humanitarian aid			1
at least nine people were killed and 30 more wounded in friday 's attacks in @entity5 , said a doctor , who is a member of the medical committee in the city			2
" there is an indiscriminate shelling now in @entity5 , " said the doctor , who asked not to be identified because he feared retribution by @entity8 's forces			1
@entity2 's @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227 contributed to this report .			0
