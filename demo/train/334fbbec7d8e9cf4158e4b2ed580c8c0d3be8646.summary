-- @entity2 tennis star @entity1 revealed she is reaping the rewards of a brutal preseason training regime after reaching the semifinals of the @entity6 for the third time in four years			1
sixth seed @entity1 beat the @entity11 's world no. 4 @entity9 on tuesday 7 - 5 6 - 3 to advance to the last four of a major for the first time since becoming @entity15 's first grand slam singles champion at the @entity17			1
last year @entity1 began working with @entity18 , former trainer of seven - time grand slam winner @entity19 , after deciding to end her professional relationship with husband @entity22			1
" we train every day for five , six hours , but not only playing tennis , " the 30 - year - old told reporters after setting up a tie with world no. 2 @entity27			1
" @entity29 was like maybe two , three hours			2
fitness was for two or three hours as well			2
" first time i was training with him , i was so excited , but after three days , i was dying			2
my husband did n't come with me to @entity35			2
" i called him and said , ' @entity18 is crazy '			2
he was like , ' why ? ' i described the program to him			0
he was like , ' do n't joke			0
' i said , ' hey , listen , i 'm not making a joke			0
' " @entity1 , the @entity6 runner - up in 2011 , said ending her tennis partnership with her husband had caused many people to think they had also ended their personal relationship			1
" he was doing a very good job , " she said			0
" but between husband and the coach , it is very tough			0
sometimes , if he said ' we should do something ' i was feeling tired ... that 's why sometimes we have to fight			0
" the funny thing is i think two years ago someone said i was divorced			0
they asked me , ' @entity1 , we hear you are divorced			1
' " the extra fitness work paid off for @entity1 as she ground out a victory in one hour and 42 minutes against an opponent who had beaten her at the recent @entity61 event and went into @entity62 undefeated with two titles to her name in 2013			1
" she 's a tough player , " @entity1 said of @entity9 , who had not dropped a set this year before the match			1
" i was feeling against a wall			0
she can hit everywhere , but without a mistake			0
you have to focus on every shot			0
not every point , every shot			0
if you hit slow or short , she 'll attack			0
" @entity27 booked her place in the last four with a fifth consecutive straight - sets victory			1
the four - time grand slam winner made light work of fellow @entity82 @entity81 , beating the 19th seed 6 - 2 6 - 2			1
the 2008 @entity62 champion has dropped just nine games en route to the semifinals , a record for the tournament , but dismissed suggestions that her relatively untroubled run to the latter stages would leave her unprepared for @entity1			1
she has already earned $ 500,000 in prize money for just 315 minutes on court -- $ 1,587.30 a minute -- despite coming into the season 's opening grand slam under an injury cloud			2
" well , going into the match , my goal is not really to be tested , " joked @entity27 , who lost last year 's final against world no. 1 @entity98			1
" if i do come into a situation where i feel like i have to pull through or i 'm not playing my best tennis or she 's up and i have to find a way to win , then that 's what you have on that given day			0
