-- imagine a woman dying under a rain of stones while buried in the ground to the top of her breasts			0
imagine faceless figures throwing stones at her			0
imagine her last thoughts , wishes and dreams			0
imagine her hoping to magically survive this brutal punishment			0
imagine her children watching her bleed and moan as people throw stones with ignorance and cruelty			0
imagine this nightmare taking place under the present - day laws of a country			0
imagine a country where lawyers , journalists , human rights and women 's rights advocates who courageously speak out against unjust laws often face grave consequences such as detention or exile			1
@entity34 , a 43 - year - old woman , had been sentenced to be stoned -- although after an international outcry , @entity35 has issued a statement saying she will not be punished in that way			1
over the past 31 years , many have suffered such inhumane punishment in @entity35			1
with the establishment of the @entity44 in 1979 , @entity42 fundamentalism took over the laws of the country			2
consequently , women and the right to their bodies became the focus of the @entity42 laws in @entity35			0
in other words , fundamentalist rulers of @entity35 have claimed as their own , the inherent right of a woman to her body			2
the @entity57 of @entity35 specifies stoning as the punishment for a married woman or man found guilty of adultery			1
and legislators set ruthless conditions for carrying out the stoning , including that the pebbles used should be big enough to kill the victim , but not so large that they kill him / her too quickly			0
as a lawyer and women 's rights advocate who practiced law in the @entity44 for 22 years , i have worked on numerous stoning cases			2
once during my career i took a risk and personally approached a young cleric who was the judge of one of my stoning cases and asked , " do n't you think this cruel and inhumane law of stoning should be changed ? " the young judge looked at me with compassion and pity and said , " @entity86 , do n't you utter this statement somewhere else ! stoning is a verdict set by @entity90			0
the earthly human can not change a verdict set by @entity90			0
" i never understood how the merciful @entity90 who is said to have created the humankind would treat its creatures with such a degree of malice			0
in a situation where people are enslaved by ruthless laws , human rights and women 's rights advocates began to ask for help from the international community			1
each time someone is sentenced to stoning , human rights and women 's rights advocates coordinate efforts to remind the world of the unjust laws in @entity35			1
they remind the world that a form of corporal punishment as severe as stoning is the denial of the @entity117 , or @entity117 , to which @entity35 is a signatory			2
in fact , @entity119 6 ( 2 ) of @entity117 explicitly states that the death sentence is to be imposed only for the most serious crimes			0
not only does @entity35 not abide by this article , it continues to issue stoning orders as a sign of obstinacy against the people of @entity35 -- who never witnessed a single case of stoning in modern times before the @entity131 -- and the international community			2
in spite of the efforts of human rights and women 's rights advocates to raise awareness about the systematic and comprehensive violations of human rights in @entity35 , stoning remains a legitimate punishment for adultery in the @entity57			1
one of the critical challenges that further facilitates the violations of human rights in @entity35 is that the international community is mainly focused on the nation 's nuclear program rather than the human rights situation			1
the world owes to the @entity151 of @entity35 a reconsideration of its priorities in regard to the @entity44			1
the time has come for the international community to seriously hold it accountable for the unacceptable violations of human rights against its citizens			1
people and organizations in the @entity164 and other nations should make it their explicit goal to work toward spreading the word about what goes on in @entity35 , condemning it in international forums and supporting those @entity35 who , inside or abroad , try to speak out against these violations			2
what we hope to see is that the human rights situation becomes a top priority of @entity164 diplomatic work towards eventual negotiations with @entity35			1
for as long as the world neglects the human rights situation in @entity35 , more women and men will have to face their horrifying destiny , as determined by unjust laws , all alone			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the co-authors .			0

after international *protests* , @entity35 issued a statement saying a woman would not be stoned to death
@entity193 , @entity194 say others have suffered the horrific punishment
they say @entity44 *leaders* defend practice as a divine verdict
co-authors : @entity204 should give priority to opposing human rights *abuses* by @entity35
