@entity27 ' wife saw damage to the siding , @entity8 said			0
" the bullet was taken by our detectives and turned over to our ballistics unit for further analysis , " @entity8 said			0
" at this point , all i can say is that it appears to be a long gun , not a handgun or shotgun			1

@entity3 , who has been a vocal critic of illegal immigration , is the anchor and managing editor of @entity0 's " @entity44			1
