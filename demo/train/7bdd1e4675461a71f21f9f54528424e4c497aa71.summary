-- declaring himself frustrated with political fighting in @entity4 , president @entity1 on thursday blamed some of the nation 's continuing economic troubles on government inaction and urged @entity9 to tell their elected representatives in @entity11 to pass bills that will create jobs			1
in an energetic speech to workers at a @entity17 , @entity18 , hybrid car battery plant helped by government stimulus funds , @entity1 said the @entity9 economy and @entity9 workers are capable of being the best in the world , but were being held back by political stalemate in @entity4			1
" there is nothing wrong with our country			0
there is something wrong with our politics , " @entity1 declared to applause			1
last week 's first - ever downgrade of the @entity9 credit rating by @entity37 's " could have been entirely avoided if there had been a willingness to compromise in @entity4 , " the president said , adding : " it did n't happen because we did n't have the capacity to pay our bills			1
it happened because @entity11 does n't have the capacity to come together and get things done			0
" " you hear it my voice			0
i 'm frustrated , " @entity1 said , referring to what he called the " worst kind of partisanship " and the " worst kind of gridlock " in @entity4			1
while @entity1 called on @entity56 and @entity57 to put the welfare of the country ahead of partisan gains , his comments appeared aimed at @entity57 opponents accused by @entity56 of pursuing a narrow political agenda in the @entity63 and stalling progress in the @entity65			2
citing " things we can do right now to accelerate job growth , " @entity1 complained that " the only thing keeping us back is our politics			2
" he called for @entity4 to immediately approve measures that he said were " ready to go , " such as a payroll tax cut extension , a road construction bill and free trade agreements with @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			2
" the only thing preventing these bills from being passed is the refusal of some in @entity4 to put country ahead of party , " @entity1 said			1
he called on people to tell their senators and @entity4 members to " stop sending out press releases , start passing bills , " adding : " they 've got to hear from you			1
" @entity1 also promised more proposals in coming weeks intended to stimulate job growth , but he acknowledged that @entity4 also has to address mounting federal budget deficits			1
the debt ceiling agreement passed by @entity4 last week and signed by @entity1 cuts government spending by more than $ 900 billion and creates a special congressional committee to work out another $ 1.5 trillion in deficit reduction steps			1
despite the agreement , the subsequent @entity37 downgrade and global economic instability has caused wild fluctuations on @entity102 this week			0
repeating his call for a comprehensive approach to deficit reduction , @entity1 said the country needs to continue investing in education , clean energy and other vital areas while also ensuring that entitlement benefits for senior citizens are protected			2
that means a balanced approach to deficit reduction in which wealthy corporations and individuals are paying their fair share toward a solution , he said to applause			0
" everybody 's got to chip in , " he said			0
you learn it in kindergarten			0
" it was @entity1 's second visit to @entity17 , an emerging hub for hybrid car battery technology			1

before the speech , @entity1 got some good news when the @entity139 reported the number of first - time filers for unemployment benefits fell last week , dipping below 400,000 for the first time in four months			1
the figure of 395,000 beat economists ' forecasts of 409,000 , according to consensus estimates from @entity148			0
" it 's a good sign , " said @entity149 , @entity9 economist with @entity150			0
" the trend in claims is going to be one of the most important things we watch over the next few weeks or so , to gauge whether we 're entering another recession			2
" however , the unemployment rate remains above 9 % , and @entity1 's visit to @entity17 was intended to highlight his job - creation policies			1
both @entity160 and @entity75 's @entity161 have built battery plants in @entity17			2
