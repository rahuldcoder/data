@entity4 and the @entity51 say @entity2 has given heavy weaponry and training to the rebels , as well sending @entity2 troops over the border to fight alongside them			1
@entity2 's president @entity57 denies the claims			2
@entity2 sends convoy meanwhile , a third @entity2 humanitarian - aid convoy has arrived in the city of @entity63 in eastern @entity4 after crossing the border early saturday , @entity2 's state - run @entity60 reported			1
the 200 trucks are carrying food , power generators , medical supplies , clothes and bottled water , according to the report			0

" @entity79 spokesman col. @entity78 told reporters in @entity81 on saturday that @entity2 had informed @entity4 that it would send a humanitarian aid convoy but that it had not asked for permission			1
@entity78 was not able to confirm that the convoy had crossed the border			0
he said separatists control the @entity87 checkpoint through which the convoy reportedly passed and that @entity4 border guards would not be able to inspect the trucks ' contents as they do not man the crossing			2
two previous convoys entered @entity4 from @entity2 without the permission of @entity4 authorities or checks on what the trucks were carrying			1
they delivered supplies to the city of @entity101 , like @entity63 a stronghold for the @entity6 rebels who have been battling @entity4 forces for control of the area			0
@entity107 ' fully satisfied ' with @entity109 help on thursday , @entity4 president @entity107 advocated before a joint session in @entity111 in @entity112 for greater support to his military , which has been battling @entity6 rebels in his country 's east			1
the @entity109 has sent nonlethal aid such as blankets and night night vision goggles , but @entity107 requested help arming his troops -- a request that once again was rebuffed			1

sanctions pressure @entity2 @entity2 's incursion into @entity4 has spurred several rounds of economic sanctions from the @entity109 and @entity151 , which have so far failed to persuade @entity57 to change course			1
after @entity107 's speech to @entity111 , legislators on the @entity154 panel voted unanimously to advance a bipartisan package of new aid to @entity4 that includes both military and non-military assistance to the country			2

at the same time , the @entity164 and the @entity165 ratified a political and economic agreement that also includes free trade provisions , though they wo n't come into force until the start of 2016			0
former @entity4 president @entity171 's decision to drop the @entity173 agreement late last year in favor of closer ties with @entity176 triggered the popular unrest that led to his ouster in february , followed by @entity2 's annexation of @entity4 's @entity181 region a month later and the deadly conflict in eastern @entity4			1
