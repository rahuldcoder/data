-- this will sound a bit strange , i know , but whenever i walk into a grocery store , i have to decide whether or not i feel like telling the cashier i 'm gay			2
and right now , you 're probably thinking : " under what circumstances would anyone have to tell the complete stranger at the checkout counter about his sexual orientation ? " i assure you it 's not about sex			2
i love giving them to my partner			2
so often when i 'm at the grocery store , i 'll pick up a dozen roses for him			2
and then the cashier grabs them off the conveyor belt and , because they 're roses , usually says something along the lines of , " oh , she 's going to love these			1
" and that , my friends , is why i have to decide whether or not i feel like coming out to a cashier when i go to the store			2
the assumption is i 'm buying the roses for a woman			1
but do i correct the cashier — thus revealing my sexual orientation — or do i just let that person go on with the assumption and , well , in a sense stay in the closet ? and before you answer , first ask yourself if your answer would change if i were straight and the cashier said , " he 's going to love those			1
" this scenario is not a hypothetical			0
it 's just my everyday life			1
and there are similar moments of everyday life like these that people in the @entity56 community have to negotiate all of the time			1
i 'm not sharing my grocery store anxiety to play victim , nor am i trying to somehow make straight people feel guilty			2
some of my best friends are straight , and they are fine people			2
but there is something wrong when a man buying roses for the man in his life becomes a political statement			1
true , when someone of note comes out of the closet , culturally we 're at the point where many of us respond with a great big " who cares ? " that , in a sense , is progress			0
but when there are 29 states where people can be fired for no other reason than being gay ; when there are 35 states where people can be fired for being transgendered ; when 29 states have constitutional amendments banning marriage equality , responding with " who cares ? " is either naive or disingenuous			0
obviously , a lot of people care			0
otherwise , folks in @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 would not be afraid to lose their jobs if their employer were to learn they were buying roses for their same - sex partner			1
for those who consider themselves supportive of lgbt rights , perhaps instead of saying " who cares ? " the more proper response is " i care			0
" i care that so many @entity104 are afraid for their safety for no other reason than who they are			0
i care that we have laws in place that deny so many @entity104 the mechanisms they need to take care of their families			0
i care that right now , there is a young person contemplating taking his or her own life because he or she has been the target of relentless bullying at school , has no support and does n't see a way out			1
thursday — today — is @entity123 , and organizations such as the @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 — all of which i 've been a part of in one capacity or another — are encouraging fair - minded people to wear purple as a way of letting these young , desperate kids know that this country 's response to their problems is not " who cares ? " — it 's " i care			1
" so many times , the conversation surrounding lgbt rights is framed by the opposition as a movement that is trying to recruit kids , infringe upon religious rights or ram " gayness " down people 's throats			1
the reality is that some of us are just buying flowers			0
am i oversimplifying the issue ? i do n't think so			0
after all , what 's complicated about being a decent human being ? this week , the nation honored the work and life of dr. @entity163 during the dedication of his memorial in @entity166 of my favorite quotes of his is " in the end , we will remember not the words of our enemies , but the silence of our friends			1
" the silence of our friends			0
so many of us know better but choose to be silent for fear of outing ourselves or being " guilty by association			0
" as a result , we let the jokes slide , the slurs be said , the punches be thrown			0
in the meantime , the @entity125 reports that @entity56 youths are four times more likely to commit suicide than their straight counterparts			1
when i hear the stories or see the numbers , i feel as if i have no choice but to tell the cashier in the store that the roses are for my partner			1
and he 's a dude			0
not because i 'm parading my sexual orientation around , but because i should n't have to apologetically cram my existence into a dark room , not even for the brief moment it takes for me to pay for my groceries and roll my shopping cart out the door			0
i come out to my cashier not because i need to say it , but because of the possibility that someone in the neighboring aisle needs to hear it , and i will wear purple on @entity123 in case someone whose path i cross needs to see it			1
and judging from the numbers , i 'm pretty sure someone does			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			2

@entity214 says that when he buys roses , cashier assumes partner is a woman
he says such things are an everyday fact of his life and should be corrected to fight bias
he says it 's good to support @entity56 people but especially *important* to *actively* do it
@entity214 : today is " @entity123 " ; wear purple to show @entity56 people you support them
