-- villagers and police clashed outside a small town in southeastern @entity5 on saturday , one week to the day after a popular local leader there died under contested circumstances , an eyewitness said			1
the eyewitness , who asked not to be identified because of safety concerns , said villagers threw rocks at police at a major intersection on a road between the towns of @entity16 and @entity17 , outside of the city of @entity19			1
authorities chased protesters , the eyewitness said			1
they beat some and arrested others , the person said			2
@entity0 was not immediately able to independently verify the account of the protest			0
the incident was not reported in @entity5 's official state media , and the @entity5 government had not released an official statement on the clash as of late saturday			1
the eyewitness sent @entity0 amateur video of the event , which showed police and groups of villagers clustered around a busy intersection			1
at one point , what looks to be a rock is thrown into the crowd			0
earlier , activists and journalists in the area had announced on @entity49 that local villagers were planning a protest march in response to @entity54 's death and its aftermath			1
the march was scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. saturday in the town of @entity16			0
at 9 a.m. , anti-riot and traffic police appeared at major intersections in the area to prevent the protest , the eyewitness said			1
blocked by police , the crowd began to head away from the town and toward the village of @entity70 , the hometown of @entity65 , said the eyewitness			1
@entity72 is located in @entity73			0
@entity74 was killed in @entity73 on december 25 , and photos of his corpse underneath the wheel of a large truck went viral in the @entity5 blogosphere			1
the photograph was unmistakably graphic : a lifeless man under the large tire of a truck -- his eyes shut , mouth half - open with blood streaming out and his head detached from his crushed body			0
the circumstances surrounding the death of 53 - year - old @entity74 last saturday , however , almost resemble the plot of @entity94 filmmaker @entity93 's classic " @entity92 " -- with differing versions of the event and flip - flopping witnesses			2
the government initially said @entity74 died in an ordinary traffic accident and detained the truck driver			1
but as shocking images from the scene in @entity73 city began to appear on a popular @entity5 online forum last sunday , some posts suggested he was murdered by local officials for advocating villagers ' rights in a land dispute			1
word quickly spread online and mainstream @entity5 news media picked up the story			1
many people were appalled by the gruesome details described by two people who claimed to have witnessed the death			0
@entity74 was held down to the ground by three masked men as a heavy truck slowly drove over his neck , the @entity118 newspaper quoted one of them as saying , adding that police had detained another witness			2
@entity74 's life story also struck a chord with the public			2
when the @entity73 government in 2004 approved the construction of a power plant in @entity74 's village , the farmers were tricked into signing their land away for free , according to a report in the @entity137 newspaper			1
@entity74 , then the village chief , led his fellow villagers in protesting the land grab and demanding proper compensation			2
he was arrested and sentenced to prison twice but continued the fight after his release -- even traveling to @entity143 to petition the central government , the @entity137 report said			2
amid rising national outrage over the alleged murder of a local hero , authorities in @entity19 city in @entity151 province , which oversees @entity152 , launched a criminal investigation tuesday -- and drew their conclusions less than 48 hours later			0
in a late - night press conference wednesday , officials reiterated that @entity74 was a victim of a traffic accident , not a murder			1
police assigned blame to the inexperienced trucker driving without a license , the severely overloaded vehicle with faulty brakes , the slippery road on a rainy day -- and even @entity74 himself for not being careful when crossing the road			0
" we thoroughly investigated the life and work as well as social connections of the suspect ( driver ) , and eliminated the possibility of him intentionally killing ( @entity74 ) , " said @entity171 , deputy police chief of @entity19			0
" there were obvious skid marks , drag marks of the body and collision marks on the scene , all of which contradicted the scenario of someone being held down and crushed , " he added			0
state - run @entity190 later aired interviews of the two eyewitnesses , including a man detained for assaulting police			0
contrary to earlier reports quoting them , they both denied seeing @entity74 's brutal murder			0
" several men told me if i said these things , they would help me treat my daughter 's illness , " @entity198 told @entity190			0
the police conclusions and cctv interviews have not satisfied many online , however , especially as state censors quietly erased earlier news reports , personal posts and comments on the topic on the internet			2
with mainstream media 's independent reporting on @entity74 's death coming a screeching halt , grassroots activists continue chasing the case , digging up new information on the land dispute and traveling to @entity73 to talk to villagers			1
@entity221 , a rights activist , has obtained a lengthy police video that showed the chaotic scene after the truck crushed @entity74			0
he posted it online for the public to view and analyze before heading to the village thursday evening to offer legal assistance to anyone in need			0
" i do n't prejudge -- i just want to restore the truth , " he told @entity0			0
" the way the authorities dealt with this incident was just not open or fair -- they have lost all credibility			2
" @entity221 said the @entity236 provides ordinary @entity5 with an outlet to express their anger over injustice resulting from a storyline common in the country -- poor farmers losing land to corrupt officials working with businesses , and then losing even more in failed attempts to petition to higher authorities			1
" this death really shows the bottom line of what is intolerable keeps getting lower , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity251 contributed to this report .			2
