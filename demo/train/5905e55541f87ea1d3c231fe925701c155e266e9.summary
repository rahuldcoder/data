-- february 4 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity13 , @entity14 : hi ! i 'm @entity16			1
@entity17 , @entity14 : and i 'm @entity18			1
@entity19 : and we 're from @entity21 , @entity22			1
@entity23 : and this is @entity25 with today 's @entity0 ! @entity26 , @entity27 : very nicely done , ladies , getting us off to a galloping start			1
that was awesome , just like fridays ! wonder if those horses were neighbors			1
whether you live next door or halfway around the world , we welcome all of our viewers to @entity0			1
first up : roof collapse @entity40 : so , let 's say you 're a @entity43 or @entity45 fan			1
you 're heading to the @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity48 to get away from the cold weather in your hometown			2
but when you show up in @entity48 , the wind chill is 10 degrees below zero ! believe that ! that 's what it felt like in @entity47 yesterday			2
throw in several inches of snow and ice , parts of the city just shut down			2
one @entity45 player said it was funny to see everything closed			2
he said in @entity65 , this would 've been a normal day			2
what we 're about to show you , though , is not normal			2
that 's the power of this snowstorm			1
the roof of the building in @entity75 completely collapsed under the weight of all the snow			2
luckily , everyone who was inside got out safely ahead of time			2
@entity80 @entity40 : the @entity80 has taken place in @entity4 every year for nearly six decades			2
during yesterday 's prayer breakfast , president @entity82 gave a very personal speech about his religious faith			2
he talked about how his faith sustains him and how he asks @entity87 for strength			2
the president was n't the only speaker at the event			2
@entity93 astronaut @entity92 -- he is the husband of congresswoman @entity95 -- gave the closing prayer			1
he also talked about his wife 's recovery from a shooting attack in @entity100			2
the president also talked about violence that 's taking place in a different part of the world			1
@entity93 president @entity82 : we pray that the violence in @entity5 will end , and that the rights and aspirations of the @entity5 people will be realized			1
and that a better day will dawn over @entity5 and throughout the world			1
@entity112 & @entity113 @entity40 : people who support and people who are against @entity5 's government continued to fight against each other in the country 's capital of @entity120 on thursday , though the fighting was n't as intense as it was the day before			1
in an interview with @entity123 of @entity124 , @entity5 president @entity125 , who 's the main focus of these protests , said he was very unhappy about the fighting			1
he also said that he would leave office right away , but that he did n't want to risk plunging his nation into chaos			2
political protests certainly are n't a new idea			1
they 've been happening for centuries			2
but as @entity137 explains for us now , there is a very modern twist to these protests in @entity5			1
( begin video ) @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity4 : pictures that speak a thousand words			2
protests fueled by 140 characters			2
the unrest in @entity5 targets the 30 - year tenure of leader @entity125 , protests led by a generation that 's come of age and found their voice in the era of social media			1
@entity157 , @entity158 : you have a generation right now , an entire generation that was born under the @entity125 rule , that has taken to the streets and they want him out			2
@entity165 : while the percentage of @entity5 engaging in social media is small compared to that in the @entity93 , like @entity167 , it 's young @entity5 making the most use of it			1
so before they took to the streets , they took to @entity174 and to @entity175 to mobilize , organize , to share their anger with each other and with the world			1
but at points during the height of the unrest , those tools went dark , with reports of the @entity5 government cracking down on @entity174 and @entity175 use , and cutting off internet access			1
a move criticized by the @entity188			2
@entity189 , white house press secretary : we believe that the people of @entity5 have a right to freedom of expression and freedom of speech , and that includes the use of the internet			1
@entity165 : and even with postings from within @entity5 limited , the events stayed among the top trending topics on @entity174 , piquing the interest of social media users worldwide using a number of hashtags			1
@entity207 : the demonstrations that you 're seeing right now in the streets , that 's an example of online activism going back into the real world			1
( @entity215 ) health care debate @entity40 : an effort to overturn the controversial @entity219 will not be moving forward in the @entity220			0
@entity221 blocked the move by @entity223 on wednesday in a 51 - to - 47 vote that was right down party lines			0
two @entity227 senators did n't vote			0
the @entity229 - controlled @entity228 voted to overturn the law last month			0
but with the @entity220 vote on wednesday , this debate may be over in @entity233			0
but it 's not over in the courts			0
earlier this week , a federal judge in @entity237 ruled that the health care law is unconstitutional			0
another judge has ruled the same way			0
but two other federal judges have said the opposite			0
all this , what this means , this will probably end up in front of the @entity93 @entity247			1
so there 's a good chance we have n't heard the end of this health reform law debate			0
@entity254 @entity255 , @entity14 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity258 's social studies classes at @entity259 in @entity260 , @entity4 ! on the @entity6 calendar , what year has just begun ? you know what to do ! is it the year of the ... a ) rabbit , b ) ox , c ) snake or @entity267 ) @entity268 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! the @entity6 calendar has just kicked off the @entity270			0
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity274 @entity40 : all right			0
the @entity6 calendar is lunar ; it 's based on the moon			0
and in a 12 - year cycle , every year is assigned a different animal from ancient times			0
astrologers describe the rabbit as kind and gentle , so maybe this will be a year of calm in @entity6			0
who knows ? one thing we do know			0
these @entity270 celebrations are hopping , and they 're going to go on for two weeks			0
the new year kicks off a fifteen - day spring festival			0
there are parades , like this one			0
a lot of fireworks and festivities			0
and we 're not just talking about things that happened in @entity6			0
these celebrations happen in cities all around the world			1
@entity301 @entity40 : there was a time , when you wanted to ask someone out , you 'd pass them a note that said " do you want to go out with me ? check yes or no. " and you 'd really , really hope she did n't say maybe			0
these days , dating , of course , as you know , is a lot more high - tech. but the technology can also be used in harmful ways			1
we have a report now about some of the potential problems of dating in a digital world			1
( begin video ) @entity322 , @entity323 : what else makes digital dating abuse , do you think ? @entity165 : inside this classroom at @entity328 in @entity4 , lessons about the technology that connects teens , but also brings new challenges			1
many parents are aware of cyberbullying			0
but others may not know the signs of digital dating abuse			1
and a recent survey found that more than half of teens know someone who 's been a victim			0
@entity343 , @entity344 : a lot of the things that happen on @entity175 , on @entity348 , on the social networks on the weekends , we see filter into the school on monday morning			0
@entity165 : digital dating abuse includes things like excessive or harassing text messages or emails , accessing or manipulating a boyfriend or girlfriend 's @entity175 or @entity348 page , or " sexting " with racy photos , all by simply using a mobile phone			1
@entity322 : it does n't necessarily cause dating abuse			1
you can take the phone away and there 's still going to be a controlling relationship , but it 's definitely playing out through the technology			1
@entity165 : so , " @entity370 is @entity371 , " a nationwide coalition that teaches teens about the dangers of domestic violence , now has a bigger focus on the role of the internet and social networking , during and after a relationship			1
@entity322 : you 're texting a lot , and it 's a good thing and both people are happy			0
but what if you try to break up and the texting keeps happening ? @entity165 : the students here were the first to take part in the new curriculum , a kickoff to february 's @entity390 and @entity391			0
it will soon roll out across the country , a campaign to help students understand that abuse is real , even if it 's in the digital realm			1
in @entity4 , i 'm @entity399 for @entity0			1
( @entity215 ) before we go @entity40 : before we go today , we 're taking you to an obstacle course where the obstacles are alive ! it 's at an alligator farm in @entity237			0
and it includes a zip line that takes you right over the gators ! the woman on the zip line 's thinking , " cool , gators ! " and the gators are thinking , " cool , lunch ! " fearless flyers are strapped onto safety lines at all times			0
and in truth , you 're zipping along about 50 feet over the reptiles ' reach			0
goodbye @entity40 : still , you 'd think they would put up a gator something			0
maybe these are helpful animals			0
maybe if you fall in their pit , they 'll just offer you gator - aid			0
i think that 's one of the best one 's we 've done in awhile			0
today 's sign - off line from @entity175 / @entity433 comes from @entity434 , who says a bicycle ca n't stand alone because it is two - tired			0
