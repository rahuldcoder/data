-- when it comes to taking spirited vacations , wandering a vineyard falls flat in the face of handcrafted brew			0
with more than 1,500 breweries across the @entity8 , beer is not just a drink -- it 's a destination			2
wooden barrels of beer are just part of the draw at @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15			1
" what 's happened is that the old world has influenced the new world ; the @entity8 is now a travel destination for beer , [ even ] for people from outside of the country , " said @entity16 , craft beer program director at the @entity18			1
" what 's so great about beer is that you have this range , " said @entity25 , author of " @entity26 : an insider 's guide to the @entity33 's @entity32			1
" " it 's from 3 percent alcohol to 20 percent , from super malty to very hoppy , and then you throw in stuff like fruit , spices -- you have an enormous range of possibilities			0
" with such a wide flavor profile , said @entity43 , author of " @entity45 's @entity44 , " beer travel is less about hanging out at the brewery and more about the tasting			1
in other words , do n't look just for an incredible brewer , but also for an incredible city in which to drink beer			2
although it 's a highly contested question that @entity16 calls " fodder for late - night philosophical conversations , " there are a few brew towns that these beer aficionados identify as the cream of the hops			1
eat , drink and brew local if you did n't know that @entity62 , @entity63 , is synonymous with " @entity64 , " then you clearly need an introduction to the beer scene			1
" in a lot of ways , [ it 's ] a very highly developed town for craft beer , " @entity25 said			1
the city has a reputation for going local , and @entity62 thoroughly applies that philosophy to brewing			2
" when you live in @entity62 , you become entrenched in the whole hops and malts [ thing ] because you 're living right where it 's being produced , " said @entity62 resident @entity74 of beer site @entity76			2
thirty percent of the world 's hops come from the @entity84 and @entity85 , @entity74 said			0
the other major pull is the " high concentration of breweries , " @entity43 said			0
" @entity62 is a fairly small compact area , [ but ] they 've got a free transit system , and they 've got brewpubs chockablock			0
" @entity94 and @entity95 is a great place to get advice on navigating the local beer scene , according to @entity43			1
and while you 're there , you can sample their impressive beer list including @entity63 - bottled @entity103 and the @entity105 's " @entity104 " @entity106 out of @entity15 , a brewer that @entity43 notes is " up - and - coming , doing phenomenal stuff			1
" as for breweries , @entity74 said " the one that really stands out is @entity111 with their @entity113 farmhouse style beers			0
" another stop has to be @entity115 , an all - organic brewpub fully powered with renewable energy			2
" they do a lot of the standard styles of @entity84 beers , like the @entity122 , which is our flagship beer , " @entity74 said			2
try the signature @entity122 for a taste of @entity84 flavor			0
@entity15 brew style much further south , in @entity14 , @entity15 , you 'll find what @entity43 calls " a hotbed of innovation , " where the beer tends " to be a little stronger , with more alcohol			1
" and while " all of @entity15 could be considered the state from which the innovators of craft beer came , @entity14 specifically grabbed the golden ring from the merry go round and ran with it , " said @entity135 , a craft beer consultant			1
so when you 're talking @entity14 - style beer , for most beer geeks you 're talking about @entity13			2
" the most notable guy right now is @entity148 at @entity13			0
he was one of the early adventurous brewers in @entity15 , " beer tasting expert @entity25 said			1
known for @entity113 - style beers and a " flavor first " philosophy , beer expert @entity43 said " they 're doing some really innovative , interesting stuff in terms of barrel aging and unusual fermentations , beyond basic brewers yeast			0
" beer experts also fawn over @entity162 , a microbrewery that has been pumping out diverse , high quality ales since 1995			1
" the special beers that they do are astounding , if not sublime , " @entity165 said			0
" they do a barrel - aged series , and those beers are limited to 250 bottles or less , so you can imagine the supply and demand market for them			0
" flavors of the @entity176 although other beer lovers often skip over the @entity176 because of restrictive brewing laws in some areas , @entity165 insisted that some of the best brew can be found below the @entity182			1
" one of my top three is @entity185 , with @entity186 being the center of that			1
not only is it a really fun place to visit , they make amazing beers , " he said			0
" there 's @entity193 , a brewpub that has a breakout hit called @entity196 , an imperial stout that put them on the map of craft beer			1
" @entity165 also touts his home stomping grounds , @entity202 , @entity203			0
" we have one of the top five beer bars in the world in the @entity208 , across the board , " @entity165 said			0
" you can go to @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 -- they 're rating the @entity208 as one of the top beer bars in the world			0
and if you 're here for a few days you can hit breweries like @entity219 , 5 seasons , and @entity221 's			0
" whether your drink town of choice is @entity14 or @entity224 , @entity225 or @entity226 , @entity227 recommends chatting up locals for clues on the local beer scene			2
" beer is a social drink , and beer people love to talk about the beer , " he said			2
" you can find a local or savvy visitor who can tell you about something you 've never heard of , and that makes it a phenomenal experience			0
