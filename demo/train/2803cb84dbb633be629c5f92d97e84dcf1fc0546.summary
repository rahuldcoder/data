-- it 's been said time and again that you ca n't teach an old dog new tricks , but what about giving one a new lease on life ? animal rights organizations like the @entity10 and shelters nationwide have taken to observing november as @entity12			1
to mark that occasion , some of the top senior pooches on social media are taking the cause into their own hands ... er , paws			1
@entity20 , a 12 - year - old @entity21 , is one of them			2
within the past year , @entity20 has grown into an internet superstar , with more than 500,000 @entity25 followers and considerable audiences on both @entity27 and @entity28			1
but before she was @entity20 , rubbing elbows in the bright lights of @entity31 with celebrities like @entity33 and @entity34 , she was " @entity35 , " a smelly , matted dog found roaming the streets of a small @entity39 town			2
the same year that @entity35 found herself in a shelter , @entity41 @entity40 had turned 30 and admittedly felt a little lonely			2
she always knew she wanted a dog , despite growing up in a family without one , and wanted to adopt rather than buy , so she turned to the adoption site @entity47			0
" i never owned a dog before and i did n't know what the heck i was doing , " @entity40 says			0
she also knew a puppy might be too overwhelming , so she narrowed it down to browsing for dogs in their golden years			1
in her search , she stumbled across a tiny picture of a dog who leaned slightly to the left with its tongue lolling out			0
something tugged at @entity62 about ol ' @entity35 , she told @entity0			0
she made the trek from @entity41 , took stinky home and renamed her after one of her favorite singers , @entity67			1
but @entity40 says those first days of dog ownership were not quite as seamless as she might have expected			0
@entity20 had intestinal parasites , and a grayed out eye , which the vet said she would never see out of again			0
her tilted head was the result of a bout of vestibular syndrome , which can affect a dog 's equilibrium			1
" when i first got her , i did n't know if this dog was going to live more than a couple of weeks , " @entity40 says			0
" i kind of recalibrated my expectations that this dog could possibly be dying and it 's my job to comfort it in its last days			1
" but @entity20 pulled through and now lives a rather extraordinary life in her forever home ( she can see out of both eyes and her head tilt is a beloved signature , to boot )			1
@entity40 says she initially created an @entity25 account just for @entity20 so she did n't bombard her friends with too many dog pictures			0
she never imagined people outside her social circle would embrace @entity20 the way they have			1
" i think she 's cute , but i just hoped people would n't think my dog is gross , " @entity40 joked with @entity0			2
" now , sometimes people start shaking as if they 're meeting an actual celebrity			0
" and celebrities now even reach out to her for an encounter			0
@entity40 says making an environment where @entity20 feels safe and comfortable has helped the pooch 's personality shine -- so much so that @entity40 has since quit her job in tv production and manages @entity20 's social media full - time			1
" i love having her with me , but i do it for her , " she says			0
" she hates being alone			0
she enjoys seeing the world , living life , seeing new places and meeting new people			0
" a chance picture turned into a second chance @entity116 is another lucky senior dog whose owner has harnessed the power of the @entity120			1
@entity121 owns the 15 - year - old chihuahua mix , along with her boyfriend @entity123			0
@entity116 came into their care when @entity123 , who runs the wildly successful blog - turned - book humans of @entity31 , took a picture of @entity116 sitting on a stoop in his neighborhood			1
a few days later , the owner saw @entity123 in the street and asked him if he would like to adopt her due to the owner 's financial hardship and a new marriage			2
@entity123 could n't turn down the tiny stoop - sitting dog with a mohawk			0
as with any pet owner , they started posting pictures online but soon decided there could be something bigger here			0
@entity121 has since started the site @entity145 , where she posts photos of older dogs from around the country who desperately need to be adopted			1
since march 2014 , roughly 200 dogs have been adopted via @entity116 's senior dogs -- and that 's not counting the numerous emails from viewers who said they adopted a senior dog in their nearby shelter because of the initiative			1
@entity121 says that there is a misconception about senior canines , that something is wrong with them or they 're on their deathbed			2
time with a senior dog may be limited , but sharing life with any dog is precious , she says			2
" no matter if you have a dog for five months or five years or 15 years , you 're always going to want more time with them			2
" have you adopted a senior pet ? share your experience in the comments below .			1
