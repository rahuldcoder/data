-- @entity2 's rambling speech to an empty chair in @entity4 , @entity5 , was more than just awkward performance art on a political stage			1
it actually provided a useful metaphor for one of the most nauseating aspects of this presidential election -- the growing gap between narrative and facts			1
one of my favorite quotes is by the late , great sen. @entity18 : " everyone is entitled to their own opinion , but not their own facts			2
" but because of the rise of partisan media , amplified by the echo chamber of the @entity28 and talk radio , today everyone comes to civic debates armed with their own facts			1
and so civic debates get debased , becoming more intense but more incoherent			0
the politics of the empty chair allows narratives to take the place of facts and usher in an essentially fictitious debate , inspiring monologues that feel like dialogues			1
it 's the political equivalent of shadowboxing , intellectual combat with a fear - fueled misrepresentation of your opponent			2
the funniest comment about @entity2 's performance came via @entity48 from @entity50 writer @entity49 : " this is a perfect representation of the campaign : an old white man arguing with an imaginary @entity53			1
" so @entity53 becomes a noncitizen and closet communist hell - bent on subverting the @entity58 experiment because he has a racial chip on his shoulder			1
on the flip side , @entity61 somehow wants to bring this country back to the 1950s , reimposing not just the @entity64 years but the white - bread world of prefeminist , segregation - era @entity58			2
both visions are nonsense , but both narratives have their adherents on the fringe , which is increasingly blurring with the base of each party			0
this unfortunately extends to the policy arena as well			0
so the heated debate over @entity76 is intentionally mischaracterized as a " government takeover of health care " despite that there 's no public option for health insurance , let alone a single payer			1
whatever its many flaws , the individual mandate was a plan initially put forward by the conservative @entity86 , proposed by @entity87 as an alternative to " @entity89 " in the 1990s			0
it was implemented in his state by @entity93 gov. @entity61 , who argued it advanced the virtue of personal responsibility			0
but " government takeover of health care " polls better , and so it is repeated in the echo chamber until facts start to fade			1
in the @entity104 , when a bipartisan group such as the @entity106 criticizes primary opponent @entity108 's tax plan , @entity61 holds up their analysis as impartial			0
but when they scrutinize his tax plan and find that it would actually raise taxes on middle class households by removing tax credits and deductions to pay for additional tax cuts for upper - income voters , it is attacked as blatantly partisan , not fit for decent conversation			0
in the @entity104 , the only facts acknowledged are ones that conform to political self - interest			2
there are epic ironies when the @entity104 takes center stage			0
the only mention of the ongoing war in @entity129 on the @entity87 convention 's final night came not from @entity61 , but @entity2 , who offered a line that implied we never should have gone there in the first place and that @entity53 should have removed troops immediately rather than offering a timeline			1
this got huge applause in the hall because it was a criticism of @entity53			2
the fact that it would have been seen as a seditious attack on bush - era policy just four years before was ignored			0
even wars fade from view in the politics of the empty chair			1
the most credible criticism of @entity53 is that the deficit and debt have exploded under his watch			2
but even on this solid ground , the @entity104 creeps in , ignoring the fact that surpluses were turned into deficits under president @entity64 and that the @entity156 deficit reduction plan , such as it exists , could actually increase the deficit by prioritizing additional tax cuts and making military spending 4 % of gdp			0
the @entity104 allows @entity160 to criticize @entity53 for ignoring the recommendations of the @entity162 , while conveniently ignoring the fact that he himself voted against the @entity162			2
no one talks back when you 're debating an empty chair			1
the @entity168 have their own examples of @entity171 politics , most notably when entitlement reform is proposed as part of plans to reduce the deficit and the debt			0
whenever @entity87 propose @entity178 reform , liberals reflexively reply with @entity180 tactics , trying to scare seniors about reforms that would not effect them			2
this was captured by a particularly ugly 2011 campaign ad showing " @entity160 " literally pushing grandma off a cliff			0
now @entity156 , @entity61 and company are trying to deflect attention from the details of that @entity178 plan with medi - scare tactics of their own , talking incessantly about how @entity53 's health care law will cut $ 716 billion from current seniors			1
this is an equally cynical attempt to attack and distract -- especially because @entity156 's plan keeps such long - term efficiency savings in place -- all part of an effort to confuse seniors and blur contrasts before @entity203			1
the latest parlor game in the @entity145 of the empty chair is paranoid musing about just what @entity53 will try to accomplish in an " unaccountable " second term			1
this argument implicitly acknowledges that maybe @entity53 has n't been as radical as advertised in his first term -- the @entity210 still stands and the @entity211 is not yet confetti -- but just wait until he gets his hands on that second term : then the hammer and sickle will start flying over the @entity217 in earnest			1
but @entity53 has enabled the @entity104 to flourish by too often putting oratory above operational action and by his campaign 's failure to lay out a clear second - term agenda			1
to try to stop the politics of the empty chair in @entity228 , criticisms of the @entity156 ticket should be backed up with stats and facts			1
( this is , i know , too much to hope , but it would be good politics as well as good policy )			0
perhaps even more importantly , @entity53 needs to lay out a clear agenda for the second term in his convention speech -- not just poll - tested bromides about defending the middle class , but actual plans , including an alternative path to deficit reduction that takes on some sacred cows on the left , including entitlement reform			1
members of the echo chamber love the politics of the empty chair because it allows them to speak for the opposition , creating their own cartoon images , demonizing and distorting them beyond all recognition			1
the conspiracy entrepreneurs and professional partisans who profit in this environment need to keep their audiences agitated , convinced that they have access to special knowledge			0
they become addicted to division , divorced from the actual responsibilities of governing and ironically alienated from the @entity265 they claim to admire			0
@entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity270 had their differences , of course , but they all warned against the dangers of falling into factions			0
" one of the expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts , " wrote @entity267 in his farewell address			0
" you can not shield yourselves too much against the jealousies and heartburnings which spring from these misrepresentations ; they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection			0
" it is worth taking the advice of the original founding father to heart			0
there is an alternative to the @entity104 -- and that is a serious , civic debate , backed by facts and contemptuous of fear - fueled misrepresentations , especially from our own side of the aisle			2
after all , @entity58 is too great a nation -- and presidential elections too important an occasion -- to have our country looking confused and past its prime , engaged in overheated debates with fictitious figures , while the whole world watches			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity317 .			2

@entity317 : @entity2 's empty chair points to the gap between campaign talk , reality
he says partisans on both sides distort their opponents ' views , play loose with facts
@entity317 : the distortions are particularly apparent on issues such as health care , @entity178
he says the convention gives president @entity53 a chance to sketch a second - term agenda
