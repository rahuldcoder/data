-- @entity1 + favorite has n't necessarily = 'd gold , but it sure did monday			1
also , @entity4 is being quite the gentleman about how @entity5 treated him after his race , and even giant blowers could n't help keep the weather from causing a damper			1
still holding hands @entity11 and @entity12 started as partners while still in elementary school			2
they lived 10 minutes apart			2
their parents were good friends			2
they went to the same skating club			2
that was 17 years ago			2
they are still a team			2
a gold - medal - winning ice dance team			1
they were sure - bets to win , and they did n't even come close to disappointing anyone in @entity25			1
they dazzled the audience to convincingly defeat their rivals and training mates from @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			0
the gold was the first in ice dance for the @entity1 , which has seven first - place finishes in past men 's and women 's competitions at the @entity40			1
the 15 golds are the most of any nation			0
" not really sure how to express ( how it feels to win ) , " @entity12 said			1
" it 's something that you dream about			1
it 's been an amazing journey			1
" the journey included sharing a coach with @entity31 and @entity32 as they trained together in @entity51			0
" we have been pushing each other and learning from each other not just for the last four years , but since 2006 , " @entity55 said			0
" we learned so much from @entity31 and @entity32 , and the training on a daily basis is what 's been pushing us			2
" @entity4 says it 's ok if @entity4 is upset with @entity5 over an interview that ended with him in tears , he 's being very diplomatic about it			1
if you missed it , @entity4 won a bronze in the men 's @entity67 alpine skiing race sunday			1
after the race , @entity5 reporter @entity69 asked him about his emotions and stuck with the questions after @entity4 teared up talking about his brother , @entity73 , a snowboarder with his own @entity75 aspirations who died last year at age 29			1
@entity4 -- who ended up unable to speak , doubled over and crying -- said monday he does n't blame her for asking the questions			1
" pushing is part of it , she was n't trying to cause pain , " he wrote on @entity80			0
he also went on @entity5 , telling @entity86 that he has known @entity87 , a two - time @entity88 in alpine skiing , for a long time			0
he called her a sweetheart and said he felt bad she was catching heat from television critics and what seems to be 99.9 % of the @entity95			0
" i do n't think she really anticipated what my reaction was going to be , and i think by the time she sort of realized , it was too late , " he said			0
@entity4 still has the giant slalom race on wednesday and the slalom on saturday			1
another drought broken if your team has a 62 - year - old drought of some sort , the man to call is @entity108			1
he has ended two such streaks , but it would help if your problem involved a bobsled			2
@entity108 is one of the best drivers on the planet when it comes to guiding a sled down a tube of ice			1
in @entity120 , he and his team won the first @entity1 bobsled gold since 1948 in four - man			1
on monday he won a medal in two - man , the first podium finish for the @entity1 since 1952			1
it almost did n't happen			0
@entity108 told reporters at a news conference that he has a calf injury that affects his start , and he and his teammate considered withdrawing			1
but he figured that if he did strain something further , at least when he competes in four - man on saturday , he 'll have two more teammates to help him push			0
and he wished for continued success for @entity137 sleds in the @entity40			0
" to go away having broken those two droughts is a good feeling			0
to know we 're going to go down in the record books , " he said			0
" hopefully it 's not another 62 years			2
" hard to shoot when you ca n't see tuesday looks like it will be green with some purple and lavender and a hint of white			0
we 're not talking about a figure - skating outfit ; we 're looking at the weather forecast map			2
and it does n't look good			0
@entity0 senior weather producer @entity152 says tuesday could be the first day of significant precipitation at the @entity40 , with the mountain venues looking at the possibility of rain mixed with sleet			0
there will be snow at higher elevations			0
and the air could be thick with fog			0
that means we might see a fourth postponement of the men 's mass start biathlon event , which was pushed back from sunday to monday and then to tuesday after fog spoiled the conditions			1
snowboard cross was also knocked back a day			2
not even giant blowers could send away the fog			0
you got ta love @entity175 officials			0
they always see things on the bright side			0
" i believe the temperatures are dropping in the last day or so , " said @entity175 spokesman @entity180			0
" it seems to be that no event has been canceled so far compared with previous games in @entity120 , @entity185 and @entity186			0
" the @entity187 all hail @entity189 ! i 'm sorry			1
you do n't know her , do you ? well , you 're not from @entity187 then			1
she 's the leading gold medal winner at these @entity40 ( so far )			1
in fact , she 's only the 10th woman to win three golds in one @entity40			1
and she 's the winningest olympian in her country 's history			2
if you 're wondering , she 's won three biathlon events -- the 10 - kilometer pursuit , the 15 - kilometer individual race and monday 's 12.5 - kilometer mass start			1
she finished a measly ninth in the sprint event			0
she 's been named as a " @entity187 " -- that 'll look nice on a business card -- by president @entity209			1
" from the depth of our souls we congratulate you on the @entity219 's supreme award -- the @entity187 title , " he wrote , according to the @entity211 version of the country 's website			1
she said she is really happy about that title , but she just wants to relax now			2
" maybe it sounds strange , but i do n't think i did something special , " she told reporters			0
" i did my race and my biathlon			0
the ( medals ) record sounds great and it is amazing , but right now i just feel tired			2
i wish i could just lie in bed			0

after almost two decades together , @entity1 figure skaters win gold
@entity4 cried sunday , but he was *sympathetic* on monday over a *controversial* *post-race* interview
@entity108 will bring back another historic bobsled medal
what 's better ? three gold medals or being given the title " @entity187 " ?
