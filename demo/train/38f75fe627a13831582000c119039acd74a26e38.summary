-- " sorry -- the sun is shining so i 've gone to sleep on a hill			2
" when @entity5 leaves an " out of office " note , it 's for real			1
but these days , the @entity8 -- who once left his parents ' house and came back four years later after cycling around the world -- is finding adventure closer to home			1
" originally i wanted to test myself , to see what i was capable of physically and mentally , and i suppose i wanted to try to make my mark for myself and on the world , " he tells @entity0 's @entity15 series			1
" now it 's just more the curiosity of going to new places and the simplicity of life when you 're out on an expedition , and the contrast of the life out in the wild to the real world back home -- the urban , busy , hectic life which i also enjoy			1
" so instead of trekking across @entity31 , running 150 miles through the @entity32 in a week , rowing the @entity33 , or sledding through the freezing @entity35 vistas of @entity36 , now the 37 - year - old is more likely to be leading a group of city slickers into the @entity41 wilderness -- and back in time for work on monday morning			1
" to be able to leave @entity44 on the train , travel just for 40 minutes , climb up a big hill to a beautiful woodland , be surrounded by birdsong and fresh air and silence and just enjoy being out here , " he says			0
" to cook on an open fire , sleep out underneath the stars , then wake up , smelling of smoke a little bit , a little disheveled perhaps , jump on the train , back into @entity44 , ready for another day at work , having had a real adventurous experience			1
" @entity5 , who grew up near the natural splendor of the @entity60 in northern @entity61 , was a latecomer to adventuring			1
it was n't until he got to university that the travel bug bit			0
" i was n't particularly an athletic or sporty child and i started to get into running up mountains , marathons , pushing myself harder , " he says			0
" that 's when i came up with the idea of trying to cycle around the world			2
just after i finished university , i jumped on my bike with very little experience , no sponsors and no real likelihood of success and i waved goodbye to all my friends and family			2
" four years later , he 'd cycled 46,000 miles through 60 countries and five continents -- on a budget of just $ 10,000			2
since then he 's tackled more specific challenges on sand , snow and sea , all the while seeking to push his boundaries			0
" i deliberately choose projects that i 'm not an expert at and so everything i do , i begin quite intimidated , quite daunted , quite worried -- worried about failing , total disaster , " @entity5 says			1
" i do n't really like finishing expeditions			0
once i finish something and i know i can do it , i lose interest really and i start to think about what might be next			0
" although his trips are physically grueling -- he was cycling 120 miles a day by the end of his global journey -- @entity5 says the main challenges are mental			1
" most trips i do , there 's usually some point during it when i just sit down , often just burst into tears and just think , ' i ca n't do this			0
' if i just persuade myself to get up and keep going for a little bit longer , then i do it -- and i think that 's the real appeal of adventure and certainly one of the addictive sides to it , " he says			0
" it 's the realization that you 're capable of more than you ever imagined			0
it 's also a bit of a @entity117 -- you open up and think , " wow , if i did that , what can i do next ? " i 'm not sure there 's an end point			0
" while he loves the solitude of being alone in the great outdoors , @entity5 also appreciates being able to share the experience -- as he did with two friends when they went to @entity36 in 2012			1
" it 's an amazing moment to stand there and watch the plane fly away and be left in total silence , no - one around for hundreds of hundreds of miles , " he recalls			2
" it 's very cold , you 're trying to operate camera equipment , temperatures minus 20 , minus 30 -- really hard fiddly work , freezing cold fingers			0
we were putting in long days , pulling the sledge for long , long days			0
" we were trying to push ourselves as hard as we could and also you 're trying to build up a relationship -- you know the guys are mentally worrying , ' am i slowing them down ? are they slowing me down ? ' " the physical exhaustion of trying to do it -- it takes hours to try to melt enough water to drink for the day , so it 's a grinding daily routine			0
" while early 20th century explorers such as @entity150 and @entity151 were discovering uncharted territories , @entity5 concedes that modern adventures mostly provide more personal achievements			1
" the phrase ' pointless but meaningful ' is one that i really like to view my adventures through because in one sense , cycling around the world , or walking across a desert or skiing in some ice cap in @entity36 is pointless these days -- we have technology and vehicles that do it far more efficiently , " he says			1
" we 're not actually doing anything of ' use ' in the most literal sense and yet there 's definitely something that to me feels meaningful			0
adventure has added so much to my life -- knowledge of the world , knowledge of myself , perspective and balance about the modern world that i live in back home			1
" in 2012 , he was named @entity182 's @entity181 after a series of mini-expeditions around @entity41 , and has written extensively about his experiences			1
and it 's this understanding of how we fit into the world that he hopes his microadventures will give to people weary of the city rat race			2
" @entity191 are my attempt to try to help normal people in the real world get the enjoyment out of adventures that i 've had over many years , " @entity5 explains			1
" i wanted to get the essence of adventure , the wilderness , the challenge , the escape from urban life , all these things that are really important to me , and condense them down into something small and achievable for normal people with real lives			0
" you can escape -- if only for one night -- and find nature , wilderness , a bit of peace and then go back to your normal life with a slightly shifted perspective			0
" so get working on your own " out of office " message now , there 's a whole world to explore .			2
