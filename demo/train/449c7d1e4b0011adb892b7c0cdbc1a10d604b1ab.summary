thousands of former football players and their families reached a settlement with the @entity3 on thursday in a lawsuit that put concussions , and their impact on the brain , under the microscope			1
the deal calls for the @entity3 to pay $ 765 million to fund medical exams , concussion - related compensation , medical research for retired @entity3 players and their families , and litigation expenses , according to a court document filed in @entity16 in @entity17			1
the agreement still needs to be approved by the judge assigned to the case , which involved more than 4,500 plaintiffs			1
" it 's been a struggle to get to this point , but today i will say i 'm very proud that the @entity3 has decided to stand up for all the former players who are suffering from brain injuries , " @entity22 , a former @entity3 running back who has been diagnosed with @entity25 , said during a teleconference			1
" today is so important for those who are ... hurting			0
this will bring help for them today			0
" former @entity3 player wants brain studied the case mediator , former @entity39 district judge @entity38 , called it " a historic agreement , one that will make sure that former @entity3 players who need and deserve compensation will receive it , and that will promote safety for players at all levels of football			1
" " my hope is that any players or ex-players that are suffering , or begin to suffer , from symptoms of dementia , will be taken care of in a respectable manner through this settlement , " said @entity49 , one of the plaintiffs , whose husband @entity51 committed suicide in 2009 at age 38			2
scientists found evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or @entity66 , in @entity51 's brain after his death			2
at the heart of the lawsuit was plaintiffs ' allegations that the @entity3 led a deliberate misinformation campaign -- primarily through its @entity74 -- to deny scientific data being presented in the medical community about concussion risks			1
@entity3 concussions : the facts the suit alleged that misinformation , which included studies by the committee suggesting no correlation between concussions and long - term brain damage , trickled down to players so that they did not not realize the true risks they were taking while playing			1
the @entity3 did n't comment about the settlement , but a league spokesman previously has said , " any allegation that the league sought to mislead players has no merit ... and stands in contrast to actions it took to better protect players			1
" family members of former players , some of whom are suffering from neurodegenerative illnesses , said they were stunned to find out the lawsuit had been settled so quickly			2
" i had two thoughts			0
first , i 'm glad that the league will finally take responsibility , " said @entity107 , the ex-wife of former @entity109 linebacker @entity108 , a plaintiff who suffers with symptoms of early dementia			2
" the other thing i was thinking is that ( the @entity3 ) did n't want to go into the discovery phase of the case			1
" study offers clues about how @entity66 begins without a trial , without a discovery phase to reveal evidence , there is no way to discern what the league knew -- or did not know -- about concussion risks , and whether in the face of scientific knowledge , it should have established safer practices for players sooner than it did			2
in recent years , the @entity3 has attempted to strengthen rules that govern player conduct on the field and added sideline medical staff -- unaffiliated with the teams -- in an effort to evaluate more independently injured players			1
but many have ventured that these rule changes could have been implemented years ago			0
@entity107 said her decision to join the suit on behalf of her ex-husband was less about compensation and more about the @entity3 acknowledging the potential risks of repetitive traumatic brain injury			1
what is most important , said @entity148 , a former player and plaintiff , " is to bring attention to the plight of thousands of players and the importance of taking concussion and head trauma seriously			0
" in an interview on @entity158 , @entity148 , who played for the @entity156 in the 1990s , said that by settling , the league was not accepting responsibility for allegations in the lawsuit			0
but , @entity148 said , " at least they put the proper foot forward to say , ' hey , these players , the guys who played the game before the current players actually matter			0
' " opinion : why my son will never play football the settlement includes a $ 675 million fund set up to compensate players who have suffered brain injury , or their families ; a maximum of $ 75 million for retired players ' medical exams , which could be used to diagnose future neurodegenerative disease ; and $ 10 million devoted to research and education			1
the rest of the settlement would be devoted to legal fees and the cost of administering funds to plaintiffs			0
the funds will be doled out over 20 years			0
meanwhile , the impact of the settlement may never fully register for former players such as @entity108			0
@entity107 , who has not yet shared the news of the lawsuit 's settlement with her ex-husband , said she can predict his reaction			0
" i think he will pay attention for a minute , say ' oh wow , ' and then not really think about it until someone brings it up again , " she said			0
" it 's not something he 'll remember tomorrow			0
" a tale of two former @entity3 players -- and their brains			2
