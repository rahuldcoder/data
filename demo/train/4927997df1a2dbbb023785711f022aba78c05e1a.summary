she recently talked to @entity0 about her new book , and her charity 's work			2
the following is an edited transcript			2
@entity0 : what is the best way forward for solving the orphan crisis ? @entity4 : this is a huge problem			2
we have a population of 7 billion people in the world -- 2.2 billion of them are children			1
probably half of those children are at risk for poverty , and lack of access to medical care , education and social support			1
orphans , whether they be true orphans , double or single , or children living without parental care because they 're children whose parents are unable to parent them -- children are at risk			1
the number from @entity124 that you see everywhere is 153 million children who are considered orphans , less than 18 , loss of one or both parents			1
and that number is just horrific			2
the horror of it means that these are children at risk : for early marriage , living in the streets , prostitution , child labor , and finally -- the worst ever -- children who end up exploited by adults , and traded and trafficked			1
it is all about women and children			1
it 's everything about women and children			1
it is so about women and children , i ca n't shout it enough			1
if young women are protected , and allowed the opportunities they deserve , then they would not be giving birth to babies that were not part of their family and their community			2
and they could go on and become stars and leaders			0
the book , from my point of view , is a tribute to all these families			0
we all did some great work together			0
we provided hundreds and thousands of children with homes			1
but it 's a drop in the bucket			0
it 's just an option			0
it 's not the solution to a bigger problem			0
the highs and lows of foreign surrogacy @entity0 : how did this book come about ? @entity4 : i built an international adoption consultation service			1
i ended up doing what i considered to be the best medicine i could have ever done			0
i was able to help people in a terribly vulnerable time in their lives			0
i successfully created families through adoption			2
i would shepherd them to help that child who was severely malnourished , depressed , delayed , and emotionally deprived become a really solid , juicy little butterball , happy -- it was really like being the stork			0
in the best of both worlds , it was the stork , not just the delivery of a baby in a hospital room , it was really the delivery of a baby by a collaboration , a team effort , by adoption service professionals , myself , the families			2
we were helping a little tiny child who had no potential become a person			0
i 'm very proud of that work			0
i 'm just so proud of that work			0
@entity0 : how did you get the families to share their stories ? @entity4 : i cast a wide net to get the stories			0
i sent out hundreds and hundreds of letters , maybe even a thousand			0
there were hundreds of people who wrote essays for me			0
i personally edited every story			0
the reason why i was so conscientious about editing each of the stories was because i wanted the stories to read universally			0
i wanted everyone to read this book to feel as if , ' you know , this is the story that resonates with me , that i can identify with , ' because it 's really about how parents are struggling to become parents , and children are struggling to become children			1
it was really great to write a book			0
i 'm really proud to have written a book that really reflects a huge part of my life , and the lives of so many families			0
@entity0 : what made you decide to include stories from the perspective of children who were adopted ? @entity4 : that could be a whole book			2
that could be many books			0
but i really felt that there were so many families that i knew whose kids grew up during the time i was practicing , i felt it would be a sweet touch			0
and it was an opportunity for me to have my children express their thoughts about adoption , and they readily do that			1
@entity0 : what is the story behind the cover photo ? @entity4 : that 's an extraordinary story			0
here 's this magnificent couple , attempting to adopt an @entity16 baby , and they met with some challenges			2
they ended up with a very happy ending			0
that photo really reminds me of a house			0
the way in which they look at him from the side actually look like the sides of the roof , that scaffolds him and protects him			0
what 's really interesting about that photo is how they really are looking at him , and themselves , and not at us			0
they are really showing , ' we love this baby			0
this baby is the center of our life			0
