-- the biggest near - term unintended consequence of the @entity4 @entity3 ' decision to destroy the @entity6 filibuster will be the repeal of @entity8			1
under the old @entity6 rules , a minority could use the filibuster to block undesired change			1
it required 60 votes to run over a determined minority			0
even if the @entity17 have a good outcome in 2014 and 2016 , there is a pretty good chance they will not win the 15 seats ( one third of their current total membership ) that would have been required to make major changes under the old @entity6 rules			1
winning even 14 seats in the next two elections would have left them one short of a filibuster proof majority ( and that assumes all the @entity17 would agree on repeal )			1
now , with one clever move , the @entity4 @entity3 have lowered the bar from 60 votes to 51			2
the odds of gaining six seats from the current 45 are dramatically better than trying to pick up 15 seats			0
for my entire career in the @entity39 , including when i was speaker , we were told again and again of the things we could n't pass because they would n't get through a @entity6 filibuster			1
now that inhibition is gone			0
the democrats will try to say they have only eliminated the filibuster for certain cases involving presidential appointees , not legislation			0
but what they have really eliminated is a longstanding principle of the @entity6			2
with a simple majority , @entity17 could soon push through dramatic changes like the replacement of @entity8 because a liberal minority would have no tools to stop it			1
in 2016 , every @entity17 candidate for @entity39 , @entity6 , and president will be asked if he or she is committed to replacing @entity8 in the first 100 days			1
virtually all of them will pledge to do so			0
the opportunity for a breakout from the entire obsolete bureaucratic structure is now enormous			0
this makes the 2014 and 2016 elections among the highest stakes of any in recent memory			2
when @entity8 disappears with a simple majority vote in the @entity6 , thank president @entity4 and senator @entity70 for the new @entity6 rules which made it possible			1
it all started this week			0
it will end around march 1 , 2017			0
the die has been cast			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity78 .			2

@entity78 : unintended effect of @entity6 filibuster change will be @entity8 repeal
dems *ditching* 60 - vote rule means only 51 in @entity17 needed to push through changes , he says
he says @entity17 *'s* 2016 candidates will be asked to commit to repealing **law**
@entity93 : possibility of *undoing* **law** *raises* stakes of next two elections
