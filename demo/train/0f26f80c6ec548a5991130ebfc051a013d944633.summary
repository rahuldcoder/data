-- it used to be billy clubs , fire hoses and snarling @entity5 shepherds			0
now it 's armored personnel carriers and flash - bang grenades			0
the weaponry has changed , but the target is still the same			0
if some of the photos from @entity13 last week were in black and white , you might confuse them with scenes from the 1950s south			0
white police officers beating black protestors			2
young black men lying face down in the street with police officers standing over them with assault rifles			2
we have a long history of aggressively policing communities of color in @entity27			1
police have treated black and brown people like the enemy for decades			2
in that context , the recent events in @entity13 in the wake of @entity34 's shooting come as no surprise			0
but they go way beyond @entity13			0
complete coverage of @entity13 shooting and protests what we 're witnessing is the militarization of policing , and it has become commonplace in towns across @entity27			1
every year , the @entity48 , @entity49 and justice funnel billions ' worth of dollars and military equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies to help them amass arsenals of combat - ready weaponry , according to our report " @entity56 : the @entity57 of @entity58			2
" two of the armored vehicles patrolling @entity61 right now were purchased with these federal funds			2
an estimated 600 police departments have received @entity65 vehicles , which are tanks built to withstand armor - piercing roadside bombs			1
in the years since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 , this sort of federal funding has only become more available for state and local police departments			1
we 're told that part of the impetus for the federal agencies is to get rid of surplus military equipment			1
but that 's certainly not the whole reason			0
at least one third of the wartime weapons flowing to state and local police departments are brand new			1
the better explanation is that the militarization of state and local police is a deliberate strategy funded by the federal government to aggressively fight the failed " war on drugs			1
" as has always been true of the war on drugs , the battlegrounds are disproportionately in communities of color			1
this deliberate strategy explains why almost 80 % of the paramilitary raids we studied were to search homes ( usually for drugs ) ; why @entity97 teams forced their way into people 's homes using military equipment like battering rams 60 % of the time ; and why they were 14 times more likely to deploy flash - bang grenades , originally invented to ambush wartime enemies , in drug raids than during @entity97 raids for other purposes			1
and just has been true for decades , our police 's most aggressive tactics are doing disproportionate damage to communities of color			1
overall , 54 % of people impacted by the paramilitary searches were people of color			2
dumping weapons and equipment designed for overseas combat into local neighborhoods is only adding dangerous fuel to the fire of aggressive policing			1
it might be tempting to think that the brutal tactics we 've seen are the result of a few bad police officers			0
it might be comforting to think this is a fluke			0
and that might be partially true			0
but when the government arms cops like soldiers , trains them in counter-insurgency tactics , tells them they are fighting an enemy , we should expect this type of combustive , tragic result			0
but that does n't mean we should accept the status quo			0
we need to change it			0
it 's time for @entity145 to rein in its support for programs like the @entity148 's 1033 program that allows the @entity148 to dole out weapons and stop the @entity151 from handing out cash to police departments			1
cutting this funding is part of a larger recognition that aggressively fighting the war on drugs has failed to abate drug use and instead done incredible damage to communities			2
the federal government must recognize that the funding currently going toward this war can and should be spent on more effective interventions like drug and mental health treatment and housing			1
concurrently , state and local governments should constrain the ability of law enforcement to raid people 's homes and police neighborhoods using wartime weapons and tactics			2
part of the reason this has n't happened yet is that many people were simply unaware of how militarized our police have become			0
the events in @entity13 should dispel any illusions people may have about that			0
it 's time for the federal government to stop financing a siege on communities of color .			1
