-- any way you slice it , thousands of same - sex couples across the @entity2 were thrilled by wednesday 's @entity7 rulings			1
but in 37 states , some same - sex couples were n't as happy as they 'd hoped to be			1
they 're the 37 states that ban same - sex marriage , and the @entity7 decisions on the @entity13 and @entity15 's @entity14 were n't broad enough to change that status			1
do n't get them wrong , many couples in these states feel the ruling is an overall victory , especially for " our folks in @entity15 [ who ] can be blissfully married again , " as @entity24 resident @entity23 , who anxiously awaited the ruling with her wife over the phone , put it			1
in addition to saying that same - sex marriages could resume in @entity15 , the court decided that same - sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits			1
but some couples could n't help but be disappointed that the rulings may not make a difference in their own states -- at least for now			1
what 's next for gay rights movement ? " immediately , it does n't mean anything , " said @entity41 of @entity42			2
@entity45 is one of the states that does not allow same - sex marriage			1
" there 's no reason for us to run out and get married ( in a state that allows it ) , because she would n't be able to insure me and the children			2
" @entity58 resident @entity57 agreed			0
" it 's a wonderful step in the right direction , but i still ca n't help but feel sad and disappointed that the ruling does not extend to all states , including @entity58 , " said @entity57 , who 's been with her partner nearly three years and would like to get married			2
" i can only hope we wo n't be like the last kid picked in gym class			0
" and for couples like @entity70 and @entity71 , the federal benefits ruling brings up a number of questions that even legal experts do n't agree on			1
@entity70 and @entity71 were legally married in @entity15 in 2008			0
but they live in @entity76 , where same - sex marriage is n't recognized			1
so will they qualify for federal tax , health and pension benefits ? @entity82 , dean of law at the @entity84 and a constitutional law expert , says yes			0
" a couple that was lawfully married in a state , but moves to another state , still is married , " he said			0
" their marriage has not been ended , even if not recognized in their new state			0
so they get all federal benefits accorded to married couples , though their marriage will not be recognized in their new state			2
" but @entity96 , a law professor at @entity97 and an expert on the @entity7 , did n't think the issue was quite so black and white			2
opinion : fight for gay rights must continue " it 's not clear , " he said			0
" the federal agencies are going to have to decide , and different agencies may decide differently			0
@entity106 could always step in , and eventually you 're going to have federal courts ruling			0
there may be additional protection from certain federal agencies , but it 's not clear at this point which ones or when			0
" " it would n't be surprising to me to hear the president order the federal agencies to say that if [ a same - sex couple ] is lawfully married in one state , that they have to provide benefits wherever they 're living , " he added			1
same - sex couples : what the @entity7 decision means for your finances @entity70 finds all the uncertainty frustrating and described the rulings as " an expensive baby step			1
" " are we still second - class citizens ? " he asked			0
other same - sex couples in states that do not allow them to marry say they 're still worried about the same issues that plagued them before , like hospital visitation , adoption and end - of - life rights			1
and some say that , even if they could be afforded federal benefits by marrying in a state that allows same - sex marriage , they deserve the right to get married in the states where they 've made their home			1
" i hope the @entity7 takes the ruling a step further to make it a national law , so we can legally get married under big oak trees in @entity154 , with our friends and family from all over the world sharing the joy and excitement on a day that once did n't seem possible , " mused @entity57			2
" to my @entity167 brethren in more accepting states , especially you who got a double in @entity15 ... rejoice and be happy , for this day is truly yours , " wrote @entity161 , an @entity162 resident who 's been with his partner for 15 years			0
" for those of us stuck in less accepting states , this was a huge symbolic win ... keep ( your ) eye on the prize			0
" @entity0 's @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 contributed to this report .			0
