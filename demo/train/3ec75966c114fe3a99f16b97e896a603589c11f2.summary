@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 lay in bed , exhausted and depressed			1
his 385 - pound body sank into the mattress with each breath he took			2
i have diabetes , he thought in disbelief			1
his 6 - year - old daughter , @entity12 , crawled on top of the king - sized comforter and stared at him with bright blue eyes			1
" @entity18 , will you get up and play ? " " no , baby , i 'm tired			2
" she sat back to think			2
her mom had tried to explain why @entity3 was so sad , but @entity12 did n't really understand diabetes or its dangerous implications			1
" @entity18 , are you ever going to be healthy enough to ride a bike with me ? " the question broke @entity3 's heart			1
tears started to roll down his face			2
" yes , very soon			0
i promise , " he said			1
" do you pinky promise ? " she asked , holding out her tiny finger			2
@entity3 looped his last digit around hers and made the decision to change his life			1
all kinds of excuses @entity41 and @entity3 were high school sweethearts			1
the first time they hung out at 16 , @entity3 took @entity41 to church			1
he was smart , polite and made her laugh -- three qualities that helped @entity41 overlook his size			0
" as long as i can remember , i 've been overweight , " @entity3 says			1
" i remember as a child coming home after school and having a stack of cookies and a giant glass of milk every day			0
" in high school @entity3 weighed close to 250 pounds ; he was considered obese even at 6 feet 1			1
as an adult he lived on fast food and spent most of his nights as a security guard sitting down			0
he 'd eat dinner at work -- frozen burritos , burgers and fries -- then stop off at @entity66 on the way home for the advertised fourth meal			0
" i was really kind of in my own little hole , and i did n't want to get out or do anything , " he says			0
any time their extended family tried to get together for a birthday party or holiday , @entity3 refused to go			1
" he would have all kinds of excuses , " she says			0
" he was really depressed			0
he was down on himself real bad			0
" most concerning was his lack of time with @entity12 , who got upset when her father would n't play outside			0
he 's her hero , " @entity41 says			2
" i [ knew ] why he was feeling that way ... but there was nothing i could do about it			0
" small steps for a big change since his diagnosis with type 2 diabetes in march -- and his pinky promise to @entity12 -- @entity3 has lost more than 65 pounds			1
he walks around his neighborhood whenever he can and makes sure to do the little things like taking the stairs and returning his shopping cart			0
the family is also eating better with more vegetables , leaner meats and less sugar			0
for example , at dinner @entity3 usually eats a spinach leaf salad with tuna or baked chicken with broccoli			1
@entity41 joins in ; she 's lost 20 pounds in less than six months on the new diet			1
the family recently took a trip to the @entity108 and walked around all day , something they never would have done last year			0
" i no longer lay in bed thinking that my weight is just too much to overcome , " @entity3 says			1
" i enjoy being out with family and friends and having a good time			0
" he only weighs in once a month to avoid becoming obsessed with the numbers on the scale			0
he hopes to get down to 200 pounds , a weight at which his doctor said he would probably be able to go off his medications			2
" i just want him to be healthy and happy			0
i do n't care what weight he 's at , " @entity41 says			2
the couple raised more than $ 7,500 for the @entity127 's " @entity126 : walk to @entity129 " in @entity130 on september 14			1
their team wore matching black t - shirts with a new slogan : " do you pinky promise ? " on his website @entity3 has included a section where he asks readers to make their own promises -- to themselves or to their family -- to get healthy			1
" [ @entity12 ] taught me that you can do anything you put your mind to , " he says			0
" it does n't take a big giant @entity146 takes doing a little something			0
" @entity3 still has a long way to go in his weight loss journey			1
but rest assured that he 'll keep going -- you just do n't break a pinky promise , especially one made to your little girl			2
