@entity1 got sober , @entity2 got spooked , @entity0 flashed her hits and @entity4 sang one for jerk - offs everywhere			1
( @entity6 ) -- 5			2
@entity2 , " we used to wait " " now our lives are changing fast , " sings @entity7 , spooked and sleepless			1
but his empathetic croon -- and his band 's orchestral - rock wallop -- make high anxiety sound almost sublime			1
@entity0 , " @entity13 " co-written by @entity15 and dr. @entity16 , this buoyant electro - pop singalong is 2010 's catchiest tune			0
as for that " teenage dream , " @entity18 does n't mince words : " @entity21 tonight			0
@entity22 , " @entity23 " nobody knows where @entity22 disappears to for years at a time between hits , but " @entity23 " proves she knows how to make a hell of a re-entrance			1
she sings about emotional devastation over a beat that mixes quiet - storm synths with acid - damaged riffs straight out of @entity35 's playbook			1
it 's as close as she 's ever come to blowing her cool			0
@entity6 's top five albums of 2010 2			1
@entity40 , " @entity39 " the title alone would have guaranteed hundreds of thousands of web clicks			0
but @entity40 did n't just say " f * * * you " -- he said it with humor and serious panache			0
despite the bummed - out lyrics , the @entity48 - style beat is @entity50 - bright , and @entity40 's lovelorn lament doubles as an anthem for lean times : " if i was richer / i 'd still be with ya / @entity54 , now ai n't that some shit ? " 1			0
@entity4 feat. @entity57 , " @entity59 " it takes a special kind of dark , twisted genius to raise the white flag of surrender while raising a middle finger			2
" @entity59 " is @entity4 's musical response to the @entity68 affair , but it 's much more than that : a nine - minute meditation on romantic failure and public infamy			1
@entity4 creates a huge , eerie beat out of thunderous drums and plinking piano , and he turns the phrase " let 's have a toast for the douchebags " into a refrain nearly as catchy as " she loves you -- yeah , yeah , yeah			1
" in 2010 , no other song was so crazily epic or jaw - droppingly gorgeous -- not on the radio , not anywhere			0
now , everyone raise your glasses			0
