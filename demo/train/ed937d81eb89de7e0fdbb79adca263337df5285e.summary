-- after years of resisting calls from fans , sports pundits and even president @entity3 , key conference commissioners announced thursday that they 'd propose some variation of a college football playoff			1
the leaders of numerous interscholastic athletic conferences -- including the @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 -- and @entity13 released a joint statement thursday signaling its intentions following ongoing deliberations about postseason play in college football			1
in it , they stated that an eight - team and a 16 - team playoff were not going to happen because doing so would " diminish the regular season and harm the bowls			1
" that refers to the existing system , in which winning top - level teams traditionally get the chance to play in one postseason bowl game after they 've finished their regular season			2
yet the conference commissioners opened the door to a pared down playoff			2
" we will present to our conferences a very small number of four - team options , each of which could be carried out in a number of ways , " the commissioners said			1
the statement noted that ongoing topics of discussion , as they relate to the playoff proposal , include whether these extra games will occur on " campus sites or neutral sites , " how they 'd be incorporated into the present bowl structure and how teams would qualify			0
" our process is proceeding as planned , and we look forward to further conversations , " the commissioners said			0
@entity54 's leadership resistance to a playoff system , which exists in many other interscholastic sports , has elicited strong reactions for years			0
among many others , @entity3 weighed in just days before his inauguration in january 2009 when he said , " we need a playoff			0
" @entity61 : @entity62 currently , the @entity64 system limits automatic bids to the winners of the @entity11 , @entity67 , @entity10 , @entity68 , @entity69 and the @entity12 , thereby leaving out other conferences , including almost all the schools in the @entity72			1
only two remaining at - large spots are available to all other colleges and universities			0
the top two ranked teams , as judged by the system 's criteria , play in a championship game			0
some contend that under the present setup , strong teams that are not in the more prestigious athletic conferences unfairly lose out on potentially millions of dollars in revenue			0
the @entity86 sent a letter last may to the @entity88 stating that the @entity64 , or @entity64 , system " may not be conducted consistent with the competition principles expressed in federal antitrust laws			1
" this letter was released after sen. @entity93 , a @entity95 @entity94 and major opponent of the existing system , raised the issue with attorney general @entity99 at a @entity101 hearing			0
@entity99 responded that the @entity86 had sent the letter to the @entity88 about the issue			2
afterward , @entity64 executive director @entity104 said the current system had " improved competition " and " dramatically increased access to top - tier bowl games for schools from ( nonautomatic qualifying ) conferences			1
" " the @entity64 was carefully created with antitrust laws in mind , and i am confident that it is fully compliant with those laws , " @entity104 said then .			2

@entity64 commissioners rule out an 8 - or 16 - team college football playoff
but they will ask their conferences ' *members* to consider a 4 - team playoff
the lack of a playoff has drawn criticism and @entity86 attention
