three weeks later , her body was found in a field near her friend 's home			1
she had been sexually assaulted and strangled			2
a pair of panties that did not belong to @entity28 were found near the body , in what police said was a " calling card " that helped them connect @entity48 not only to @entity28 but to the other assaults			1
from the witness stand in @entity48 's capital murder trial , one of the women recounted how she was attacked on the @entity55 campus			1
she said her assailant threatened her with a gun , raped her and took her panties as a souvenir			2
the defense challenged the identification because she earlier told a friend she could not describe her attacker to police			2
the second woman , a student at the university , testified she was abducted outside her apartment and driven to a dark area and raped in the attacker 's vehicle			1
the woman testified that her assailant asked for her panties and took them with him			0

after they attended a concert , she slept on the living room couch in a friend 's off - campus apartment			0

detectives immediately followed up on the tip and , with permission from the girlfriend , took dna samples from @entity48 's 4 - year - old son			0
lab tests showed that the boy 's father -- @entity48 -- was almost certainly a match for the dna found on the doorknob and at the crime scene , police said			2
