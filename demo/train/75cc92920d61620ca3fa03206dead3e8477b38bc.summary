while @entity3 is a closed communist state , a rogue nuclear power that regularly threatens war and starves its own people in prison camps , @entity2 has just returned from some one - on - one diplomacy with its " dear leader " @entity9 and has good news to report : " i love him			1
" i 'm going to go out on a limb and say this is n't going to look much better in the eyes of history than @entity18 vouching for @entity20 's character in the late 1930s			1
but say this for the retired rebounding champion known as " @entity2 " -- he got closer to the young dictator by walking in the front door of @entity3 with the @entity26 and vice magazine than diplomats and intelligence services have gotten to date			1
as former assistant secretary of state @entity30 told @entity31 , " there is nobody at the @entity34 who could tell you more personally about @entity9 than @entity2 , and that in itself is scary			1
" 5 ways @entity3 is getting stranger bonding over a shared love of basketball and getting drunk with the dictator 's entourage sure sounds like a cozy way to visit a country where 3.5 million people have starved to death since 1995			1
but it requires a bit of willful ignorance to scoop up the state propaganda and be used as a dupe for their domestic state - run media , which is also likely to portray the diminutive dictator as an all - time dunking champ			0
in a rambling interview on @entity31 ' " @entity56 , " @entity2 defended his trip and his budding friendship with @entity9 , telling @entity59 : " i do n't condone what he does , but as far as a person to person , he 's my friend " and then went on to the fetid well of moral equivalence to dismiss the prison camps and reports of mass murder as " just politics			1
" @entity2 is far from the first celebrity to be used for publicity purposes to prop up a dictator and even profess real friendship			2
@entity18 cozied up to @entity20 in a naive attempt to keep @entity76 isolationist in @entity77 singer , actor and attorney @entity80 was taken in by the @entity81 and proclaimed its lack of segregation was evidence of freedom 's progress while millions were being murdered by @entity89 in gulags			1
@entity92 - winning novelist @entity91 was proud of his personal friendship with @entity95 's communist dictator @entity94 , propelled by long nights of drinking and philosophizing by the @entity99			0
in more recent years , stars have taken big money from dictators in exchange for private concert performances , including @entity105 and @entity106 appearing at @entity109 president @entity108 's multimillion dollar 35th birthday bash ( @entity106 later apologized ) , @entity110 performing for @entity111 ( she later gave the money back ) and @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 performing for @entity111 's sons in @entity118			2
( my colleagues at @entity121 put together a useful gallery of these and other " stars who hang with dictators			0
" ) the greed that simply compels one to take a gig , no matter who is paying the bill , is different than the impulse to ingest talking points and benefit from the privileges of friendship with mass murderers who can sometimes seem charmingly insane in person			0
just because you 're crazy does n't mean you 're stupid and just because a man can be a monster in his vise - like grip on a state does n't mean it should be a compelling revelation that he is also in fact human			0
as @entity144 detailed in his literary and journalistic portrait of the @entity81 , " @entity146 , " @entity89 was a fan of @entity76 musicals and after one long day of purging his own ranks with arbitrary executions , he retired to watch a comedy called " @entity151			0
" this is where judgment and moral clarity come in handy -- two concepts rarely associated with @entity2			2
that 's why @entity59 was right to hand him a copy of the @entity159 report on @entity3 after @entity2 declared his intention to return to @entity3 for another visit sometime soon			1
vacationing in dictatorships is always a bad idea , even if it is justified by the self - serving notion of conducting personal diplomacy			0
it is still , as the @entity167 once said , " a cheap holiday in other people 's misery			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			2

@entity2 returned from @entity3 with an *upbeat* assessment
@entity173 says @entity2 did n't take @entity3 's rights *violations* seriously
he says celebrities who give aid to dictators *deserve* *criticism*
