@entity0 -- in @entity3 , @entity2 stands out as one of the most effective deployers of soft power			2
rather than exporting revolution , @entity2 today exports doctors -- with more than 30,000 @entity2 doctors working in more than 100 underdeveloped countries around the world			2
@entity2 has become a marquee provider of catastrophe - related medical assistance around the world , particularly after tsunamis , hurricanes and earthquakes -- and no doubt will send large contingents of medical personnel to earthquake - ravaged @entity21 in coming days and weeks			1
moving beyond the still active @entity23 stasis in @entity25 - @entity2 relations is an @entity28 administration foreign policy priority , and the devastation in @entity21 provides a platform not only to provide relief for a nearby nation in desperate circumstances , but also to build confidence between @entity2 and @entity3 authorities in a potential collaboration of effort in a third country			1
many great @entity3 voices -- from @entity40 and @entity41 to @entity42 and @entity43 -- have said that the @entity25 embargo on @entity2 makes no sense as foreign policy , that the right of @entity25 to travel anywhere in the world should not be suspended in the case of @entity2 , and that @entity2 's exports of doctors rather than arms should be more than enough reason to strike @entity2 off of @entity3 's state sponsors of terror watch list			1
but change in a relationship as charged and historically toxic as between @entity58 's @entity2 and 11 @entity25 presidents will take narratives to move			2
one such narrative could evolve from tying @entity3 resource coordination and financial support in a regional multilateral effort with other @entity3 nations -- particularly @entity2 's deep bench of natural disaster - experienced medical corps			2
after @entity69 pounded @entity70 and southern @entity71 , @entity58 offered relief support from a 1,600 - person medical team called the @entity74 , named after an @entity3 doctor who fought in @entity2 's war of independence			1
the @entity25 predictably turned down the offer in september 2005			0
shortly after , in october 2005 , the @entity74 was dispatched to help provide much - needed medical relief after the devastating @entity81 earthquake that tore through the @entity83 mountain region along @entity84 and @entity81			0
the @entity25 and @entity86 each sent teams of doctors to @entity84 , each with one base camp deployed for a month			0
the @entity2 deployed seven major base camps and 30 field hospitals in the fundamentalist @entity94 region of @entity84 , a nation with which @entity2 did not have diplomatic relations at the time			0
today , the @entity2 and @entity84 have embassies in each other 's capitals			0
@entity100 , the new foreign minister of @entity2 , who was then the deputy , headed the mission and lived in @entity84 's rugged mountains for that full year			0
the @entity2 medical teams reportedly worked constructively and positively with personnel from the @entity25 and @entity86 -- and this kind of collaboration , even if informal , could be the kind of confidence - building narrative to move @entity25 - @entity2 relations out of the gridlock they have been in for decades			1
as a step in the direction of pushing reset in this relationship , on friday the @entity112 announced that @entity2 will allow @entity25 aircraft into its airspace for medical evacuations			1
the @entity25 could take another step and offer to airlift @entity2 doctors to @entity21			1
@entity21 is in trouble today -- the 7.0 earthquake devastating the capital city of @entity125 and highlighting what was already a human development disaster			0
the @entity129 's offices have been destroyed , with hundreds unaccounted for			0
notwithstanding any casualties among its own citizens in @entity21 , @entity2 has 408 doctors providing services there			2
now is the time for the @entity25 , @entity2 and other major @entity3 nations to throw their weight into stopping a worse human tragedy in @entity21 than already exists -- and to potentially unite @entity3 and @entity2 soft power efforts in a way that creates greater positives for @entity21 and for longer - term , 21st century @entity25 - @entity2 relations			1
