just days before the @entity2 committee announces the winner of this year 's @entity4 , the world found out who stands at the opposite extreme on the quest for peace and justice			1
we have discovered who the biggest cowards on the planet are today			0
the competition for the mark of shame is hard fought , but the title goes to the men who approached a van carrying girls home from school in @entity22 on tuesday and asked for one very special 14 - year - old			1
then shot her in the head			0
the world 's worst cowards are the members of the @entity22 @entity28			1
perhaps they believe their thick dark beards , dangerous weapons and fanatical religious pronouncement make them fierce warriors			0
but their actions tell the true story : the @entity22 @entity28 are terrified of a 14 - year - old girl named @entity37			1
and why are they so afraid of @entity37 ? mostly , because she is not afraid of them			2
and because @entity37 is a relentless advocate of education for girls , something the @entity28 find very threatening			1
the @entity28 , with all their bravado , seem to fear women most of all			1
news : @entity22 enraged over attack on teen blogger the cravenness that has come to define the group -- also known as the @entity53 , or @entity53 -- is easily matched by @entity37 's stunning bravery			1
the fearless activist for girls ' education now lies in a hospital bed trying to recover from serious injuries to her head and neck			0
overnight doctors performed emergency surgery to remove a bullet near her spinal cord and to relieve swelling in her brain			0
@entity37 knew she was on a @entity53 hit list , but she did not back down			2
the @entity28 , whose religious , social and political views are founded on a brutally anti-woman ideology , can not countenance even a young girl challenging their ideas on a blog			1
shortly after tuesday 's assassination attempt , which also left two of @entity37 's school friends wounded , @entity53 spokesman @entity76 acknowledged the group tried to kill her and vowed they will try to do it again if she survives			1
as is common , he couched the threats in extreme interpretations of @entity86 and on repression and intimidation of women			0
" any female that , by any means , plays a role in the war against the mujahedeen , " @entity76 declared , " should be killed			0
" news : ' @entity97 ' -- a chorus of support across the world the @entity53 spokesman called @entity37 's advocacy for education " a new chapter of obscenity , " adding , " we have to finish this chapter			1
" he also accused her of being pro-west and admiring president @entity108			0
@entity37 started to become a problem for the @entity53 when she was just 11			2
the @entity22 @entity28 , who hold the same ideology but are not directly affiliated with the @entity112 @entity28 , had taken over @entity22 's @entity113			1
@entity22 politicians were turning a blind eye to what had become an increasingly brutal regime			2
they executed their critics , ordered all men to grow beards and whipped women in public as punishment for real , imagined or fabricated offenses			0
it was all about imposing their will , their version of @entity86 law , and subjugating the entire population , but women in particular			2
the @entity28 reportedly had destroyed more than 200 schools and ordered all girls ' schools shut down when @entity37 slowly emerged from obscurity			1
in 2009 , she started writing a blog for the @entity138 under a pseudonym , talking about her dreams for the future and how the @entity28 were pushing those aspirations further and further out of reach			2
learn more about how you can help at @entity145 her story helped bring attention to the disaster befalling the population of the storied @entity113			0
at about the same time , the videotaped beating of a 17 - year - old girl by a group of @entity28 went viral in @entity22 , adding chilling images to a girl 's lament			1
until then , @entity22 had treated the fight against the @entity28 as an @entity158 problem , something going on across the border in @entity112			1
@entity37 helped @entity22 realize their own country , their own way of life were threatened by the @entity53			1
the government fought back and regained control of the region			0
she continued to speak out and was the first recipient of her country 's @entity168 last year			2
she and her cause became celebrated throughout the country , and increasingly despised by extremists and their supporters			0
rural areas of @entity22 and the districts near the @entity112 border include deeply traditional regions from where the @entity28 took much of their social views			1
many practices , particularly regarding women , are horrifying to more modern @entity22 living in places such as the capital , @entity183			1
the country has become a dangerous incubator of fanatically enforced prejudice			0
a prominent politician who opposed @entity22 's controversial blasphemy laws was killed last year			1
just last month a @entity190 girl was sent to prison after her neighbors concocted blasphemy charges against her			0
the country has become one of the front lines of the struggle between modernity and the deeply intolerant , misogynistic practices dating back centuries			0
@entity37 , despite her young age , stands at the battle line of the push for equality			2
@entity206 : your views on girls ' education the rule of the @entity28 in @entity112 between 1996 and 2001 showed just how the outcome in @entity22 could affect everyone , but especially women 's lives			1
the @entity53 aims to impose precisely the kind of rules the @entity28 forced on @entity112			2
@entity112 women were barred from working , studying , leaving their homes without a male companion			0
even laughing out loud was prohibited			0
they became nonentities , stoned and beheaded at the local stadium , banned from showing their faces , speaking their voices or earning a living			0
in 2002 , just after the regime was toppled , a @entity229 study of mental health in the country found a vast majority of @entity112 women suffering from depression , anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder			0
a decade later , in bordering @entity22 , in the aftermath of the assassination attempt against @entity37 , many question if the threat has receded to the extent the authorities claim			1
by trying to kill a bright and admired young girl in cold blood , the @entity28 have revealed not only their own moral makeup			2
they have also reawakened the @entity22 people to the threat posed by extremists and the choices the country faces			1
@entity22 are pressuring their populist politicians to speak out against the crime , to take sides			2
@entity22 is home to the world 's worst cowards			1
but it 's also @entity259 's home			0
let 's hope she makes it , and inspires many to follow in her small but indelible footsteps			0
there 's something -- and someone -- for the @entity2 committee to consider			0
join us on @entity271 / @entity270 .			0
