-- the @entity1 is considering how to best regulate electronic cigarettes as tobacco products			1
while some regulation is needed , the current proposal entails a huge paperwork burden that will create a barrier to entry into the market for all but the biggest players -- namely , @entity11			1
specifically , the @entity1 has indicated that it may require e-cigarette manufacturers to complete a long paperwork process before it will consider a product for approval			2
many industry watchers believe that only very large manufacturers ( i.e. , @entity11 companies ) would have the financial resources to meet the requirements , which could demand an estimated 5,000 hours per application , with every product combination requiring a new application			1
according to the @entity25 , only 25 products among thousands currently available would eventually be licensed			0
the tobacco industry will then be able to buy the small e-cigarette makers that are unable to meet the @entity1 's requirements			1
@entity11 will then get to decide which products are sold such that it can manage its own transition from cigarettes to e-cigarettes , or end e-cigarettes as a product category entirely , whichever better serves its financial interests			1
in other words , the tobacco industry will be given a monopoly over the first new product to come to market that genuinely stands a chance of disrupting the business of selling smoked tobacco			1
needless to say , the tobacco industry 's primary concern is not the health interests of the public			1
the @entity49 has assessed that " effective tobacco control and the commercial success of the tobacco industry are fundamentally incompatible ... accordingly , the tobacco industry can be expected to seek to avoid , prevent , weaken and delay effective policies and programs , which are against its interests			1
" electronic cigarettes , also known as vapor products , are designed to mimic the experience of smoking			1
by heating up liquid nicotine in battery - powered devices , vapors -- rather than tobacco smoke -- are released			0
while it 's too early to predict the long - term health effects of e-cigarettes , some experts say they are a safer alternative to regular cigarettes , which produce myriad toxic chemicals			2
for many smokers who have trouble quitting , e-cigarettes are a viable substitute			0
the e-cigarette industry is young , thriving and innovative			1
there are hundreds of online suppliers , many of which have been pioneers in developing next - generation vapor products known as " mods " or " vaporizers			0
" unlike traditional retail outlets -- such as gas stations , large grocery store chains and pharmacies -- where point - of - sale data is collected and monitored by financial analysts , growing sales at vape stores and online websites are not being tracked			0
dedicated vape stores have sprung up nationally			0
the numbers have grown from around 10,000 one year ago to about 16,000 today , according to @entity96 of @entity97 , an advocacy organization for the vapor industry			0
vapor products are increasingly attracting consumers			0
in @entity103 , an estimated 700,000 people ( 5 % of all smokers ) have transitioned to vapor products , mostly in the past two years			2
in @entity106 , e-cigarettes have helped reduce tobacco smoking according to one survey			0
these data show an impressive decline in tobacco smoking			0
since the surgeon general issued its landmark 1964 report on the dangers of smoking , public health officials have tried to combat it			1
however , high - profile researchers believe that e-cigarettes have the potential to save millions of lives among populations of tobacco smokers			1
all consumer products are regulated , and e-cigarettes should not be an exception			0
consumers need to feel confident that they are purchasing safe , high - quality items			0
but the regulation of e-cigarettes needs to be proportionate and not discriminatory , especially considering the potential they offer for eliminating the scourge of tobacco - related diseases			0
in the @entity137 , e-cigarettes have become a top choice for smoking cessation according to a survey			0
meanwhile , @entity11 is muddling along , rolling out its vapor products with their underpowered batteries and limited capacity for e-liquid			2
yet , almost unbelievably , their one salvation has arrived in the form of the @entity1			2
how the regulation of electronic cigarettes play out would have huge repercussions on public health and medical drug policies			1
the @entity1 should consider creating a tailored regulatory framework , one that would allow the e-cigarette industry to continue innovating to the point that smoked tobacco is made redundant , which could help save many lives worldwide			1
and what would this framework look like ? in lieu of its proposed regulations , the @entity1 should begin by requiring e-liquid and e-cigarette makers to register the ingredients and designs of their products			1
the agency should work closely with expert third parties -- manufacturers and scientists -- to develop strong product standards			0
the @entity1 should also conduct epidemiological research to make sure that e-cigarettes are contributing positively to smoking rate decline			2
if you start from the precautionary principal -- treat something as bad until proved good -- you miss the context that e-cigarettes are designed to replace one of the most dangerous consumer products invented			2
the @entity1 can not afford to miss this opportunity to get it right on e-cigarettes .			0

the @entity1 is considering how best to regulate electronic cigarettes as tobacco products
@entity190 : @entity1 proposal will benefit @entity11 companies , and that 's bad
he says if tobacco industry is given monopoly of e-cigarette products , public health will suffer
@entity190 : @entity1 should let e-cigarette industry innovate to save tobacco smokers ' lives
