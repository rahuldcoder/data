-- now that president @entity2 has taken a public stand on the warlords and militia gangs tyrannizing @entity6 , there is a sense that the next chapter in the human tragedy that has been raging there over the past decade and half is about to be written -- or so we can hope			1
in the @entity6 -- @entity15 's largest @entity14 country -- invasions , proxy wars and humanitarian crises have senselessly shut down millions of lives , displaced millions more from their homes and left countless women and young girls brutally raped with the world barely raising an eyebrow			2
the latest murderous attempt by the @entity27 militia gang to besiege @entity28 , the strategic regional capital of @entity6 's eastern province of @entity30 , seems to have backfired			1
the @entity31 says @entity32 has helped to create and militarily supported @entity27			2
although @entity32 president @entity34 denies backing @entity27 , the accusation has taken off some of the international gloss he had long enjoyed in the @entity36 , and precipitated cuts and suspension of aid money that goes directly to the @entity34 regime by the @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and the @entity45			1
the @entity46 , which gives no money directly to the @entity32 government , suspended its military aid			1
in a baffling expression of a refinement of the @entity46 position , president @entity2 made a rare telephone call to @entity34 to emphasize " the importance of permanently ending all support to armed groups in the @entity6			1
" that set a firm red line on the situation in that region , the first one by president @entity2 since becoming president in 2008			1
watch video : @entity34 on @entity6 this was certainly right and good			2
@entity34 is no fool ; the diplomatic but emphatic content of that telephone call , monitored by @entity68 's national security staff and published thereafter for public consumption , speaks volumes			0
he clearly understood the implicit threat			0
but it was not good enough			0
left unsaid is that withholding aid money that goes directly to the @entity34 regime has not changed many realities on the ground -- a painful reminder of the limits of what previous half - hearted , ambivalent international attempts to halt the crisis in that country had achieved			0
however , the situation is not hopeless			0
president @entity2 can help to halt the wars engulfing the @entity6			1
it is both economically and politically affordable			0
here is my suggestion -- a three - point road map , if you like , for president @entity2 , should he choose to put the weight of the @entity46 squarely on the side of the @entity6 and engage much more robustly to help end the world 's bloodiest war and human tragedy			1

changes in @entity100 if we are to be blunt with ourselves , @entity6 's major problem today -- the chief reason that country remains on its knees -- is its president @entity106			2
@entity34 is just a symptom , at least in theory			0
the crisis of leadership in the capital @entity100 , the disastrous blend of lack of political legitimacy and moral authority , mixed with poor governance and vision deficiency , then compounded with dilapidated state institutions , has become the common denominator to the ills and wrongs that continues to overwhelm the @entity6			2
in other words , peace will never be secured in @entity6 , if the moribund status quo is still strutting around @entity100			2
@entity2 's minimum objective in regard to ending the wars and human tragedy engulfing the @entity6 should be to push for changes in @entity100			1
he must make this one of the " @entity129 " of the @entity130			0
circumstances demand it to re-energize @entity6 's chance of success and to enable the renaissance of a " @entity15			0
" and given the effects of @entity6 's mounting death toll and the speed at which @entity139 is spreading because of the use of rape as a weapon of war , the sooner the better			0
keep @entity34 in the naughty corner the wars and human tragedy engulfing the @entity6 have many fathers and many layers			0
@entity32 , and to some extent @entity150 -- run by @entity15 's two dearest autocratic but staunchly pro-american regimes -- are , as they have been many times in the past , despite their denials , continuing to provide support to warlords and militia gangs terrorizing the @entity6 people			1
this is not an apocryphal claim , it 's an open secret in @entity100 , @entity161 and @entity162 as much as it is in @entity164 or @entity165 , and as real as @entity167 's role in @entity168 or @entity170 's support to @entity171			0
indeed , reporters across @entity6 and across the region would testify to this			0
@entity162 has been , one can safely argue , the sole shareholder in the @entity27 militia gang -- and its elder sisters @entity178 and @entity179			1
it can not wash its hands in @entity183 fashion of either the @entity185 - wanted @entity27 warlord @entity184 , also known as @entity186 , or @entity187 , who is wanted by the @entity6 government for war crimes and is under house arrest in @entity162			1

it would reduce the scale , scope and intensity of the killing , raping and uprooting of the @entity6 , it would crush @entity100 's ability to use external support to warlords and militia gangs as an alibi for a lack of progress and , above all , decrease the growing unease of the @entity6 towards @entity32 over the crimes of @entity218 and the role played by their government in @entity6			1
@entity218 the continued existence in @entity6 of @entity218 , a @entity32 militia gang made up largely of @entity224 -- whose leadership took part in the 1994 genocide of @entity228 -- remains one of the most persistent and serious threats to stability in @entity6 and the region			1
addressing this crisis is of significant importance from both a political and humanitarian viewpoint			0
though there are no definitive statistics on the exact numbers of @entity218 fighters , the good news is that experts tell us that the vast majority of its rank and file are in their 20s and early 30s , which means they were too young to have taken part in the genocide in 1994			2
the @entity46 , together with the @entity31 , the @entity45 and @entity251 , should appoint a special envoy for the @entity254 region to midwife a conducive political arrangement in @entity162 that could see them returning home -- and see their leaders and fundraisers in @entity260 arrested			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity263 .			0

president @entity2 can help end the @entity6 conflict for good , says @entity266
@entity2 has asked @entity32 to end all support to armed groups in the @entity6
@entity218 militia gang is a threat to stability and must leave @entity6
@entity2 must push for change in @entity6 government , argues @entity263
