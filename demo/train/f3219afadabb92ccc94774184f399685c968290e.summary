three quickfire goals in extra time gave @entity2 a 4 - 1 win over city rivals @entity4 in @entity5 saturday to win the @entity6 for the 10th time			1
@entity8 put @entity4 ahead in the 36th minute and it took an injury time equalizer from @entity12 to rescue @entity2 and force the extra half hour			1
@entity4 held out until the second half of the added time until @entity15 headed @entity2 ahead after superb work by @entity17			1
@entity21 and @entity22 , with a penalty , his record 17th goal in the @entity6 this season , rubbed salt into the wound for @entity4 , who had been bidding for a @entity28 / @entity6 double			1
coach @entity29 , unhappy at the added minutes in regulation play , summed up their frustration as he ran on to the pitch to confront @entity2 's @entity34 after the final goal and had to be restrained by stewards			0
it was a sorry end to a magnificent season for @entity4 , but ultimately the quality of @entity2 , epitomized by the world 's most expensive player @entity15 , which prevailed			1
it was the @entity44 's 22nd goal of the season and sixth in the @entity6 but surely the most important of his career			0
" this is what every footballer dreams of and it does n't come any bigger than that , " the @entity44 told @entity47 after his side 's triumph			0
for @entity2 's @entity55 it was his third @entity6 triumph as a coach , equaling the record of @entity59 's @entity58			2
his counterpart @entity29 had gambled on the fitness of his star striker @entity62 , who has been hampered by a hamstring injury , but it backfired when the @entity66 international limped off after nine minutes			0
he was replaced by @entity67 but @entity4 initially took his departure in its stride , frustrating @entity2 's attacking menace in a scrappy first half			2
it came to life in a passage of play which first saw @entity15 poke an effort wide of the post after running through the @entity4 defense			2
the @entity2 fans in the @entity80 looked skywards in disbelief but they were soon in total despair after a mistake by @entity66 international goalkeeper @entity84			0
@entity2 failed to clear a corner which was lifted back into the area and @entity87 's @entity8 beat the onrushing @entity84 to the ball to score with a flicked header			1
@entity84 desperately scrambled back to make amends for his error of judgment but could not keep the ball out of the net			0
@entity96 had been kept quiet in the first half but was more prominent after the break , forcing @entity99 to make a fine save from a free kick then narrowly failing to connect with a header in front of goal			0
@entity15 also started to live up to his price tag , charging through from the right before scuffing his effort wide , while a combination with @entity22 saw another chance to begging			2
but with time running out , @entity12 connected perfectly with a @entity111 corner to add to his two goals from the semifinal win over defending champions @entity114 and give his side a precious lifeline , of which it took full advantage			0
it was @entity2 's first @entity6 title since 2002 and to the milestone of ' @entity122 " -- extending its record number of wins in @entity126 's premier club competition .			1
