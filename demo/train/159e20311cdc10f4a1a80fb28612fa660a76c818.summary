she has released a statement saying she 's doing well			0
" i am healthy , happy and safe and will reach out to family , friends and supporters in good time , " @entity9 said			1
according to an initial incident report obtained by @entity1 , the three women told police @entity9 had abducted them between 2002 and 2004 , held them captive and sexually assaulted them			1
the family friend said @entity9 treated @entity38 slightly better than the other two women and @entity9 was treated the worst			1
all three women were underweight , the friend said			2
how the abductions happened @entity38 gave birth to a daughter fathered by @entity9 , according to dna testing by the @entity46 state crime lab. @entity9 said she became pregnant at least five times while in @entity9 's 1,400 - square - foot home , according to the incident report			1
when that happened , she told investigators , @entity9 " starved her for at least two weeks , then he repeatedly punched her in the stomach until she miscarried			1
" @entity9 said he ordered her to deliver @entity38 's child , according to a police source familiar with the investigation			1
the baby was delivered in a plastic tub or pool in order to contain the afterbirth and amniotic fluid , the source said			0
the child stopped breathing , and everyone started screaming , the source said , citing accounts by the young women			2
@entity9 said @entity9 threatened to kill her if the baby did not survive , the initial police report states			1
" what 's most incredible here is that this girl who knows nothing about childbirth was able to deliver a baby that is now a healthy 6 - year - old , " the police source said			0
@entity9 intends to plead not guilty , his attorneys told @entity1 affiliate @entity83 in an exclusive interview			1

" we are not even at the beginning of the process			0
if this was a marathon race , we 're not even at the starting line yet			0
" @entity9 's defense team may seek to move the trial out of the @entity102 to improve their client 's chances for a fair trial , lawyer @entity99 said			1

a glimpse of @entity9 's yard who is @entity9 ? @entity9 's disappearance generated far less publicity and attention than did those of @entity38 and @entity166 , and a level of mystery still surrounds her case			2
@entity0 police removed @entity9 's name from an @entity173 database of missing people in november 2003 -- 15 months after her family reported her missing -- police said			2
they did so after " failing to locate a parent , guardian or other reporting person to confirm that ms. @entity9 was still missing			2
" police said , though , that her missing person 's case remained open and was checked on as recently as november 2012			0
as of last week , her family still did n't know exactly where she was			0
@entity9 had n't spoken yet with her mother , @entity186 , a family spokesperson said			2
in fact , @entity9 's family had no idea where she was and had asked police for information on her whereabouts			2
what little is known about @entity9 's whereabouts comes from a source close to the investigation , who told @entity1 that @entity9 " is in a safe place and very comfortable			1
" the source did not specify further			0
there were reports that @entity9 was at the @entity166 home , and there was a lot of activity there saturday morning , but @entity9 was not there			2
@entity46 women just want to be with families the @entity9 family apparently has a fractured history			1
according to the @entity210 , @entity9 became pregnant and dropped out of school			1
her mother told the newspaper that she then became involved with an abusive man , who , she thinks , hurt her toddler grandson			0
the incident reportedly kicked off " a chain of events that led @entity9 to lose custody of the child			2
" @entity9 vanished soon after that , on a day she was set to make a court appearance in the custody case , @entity221 told the @entity210			1
times were n't always so tough for @entity9 though			1
