-- a decade and a day might have passed but the script was still the same			2
if you listen to the soothsayers , the powers of @entity5 's talisman are waning			1
and yet , on a night where most of those in red went missing , @entity8 refused to simply fade into the background			2
@entity5 's @entity14 dream is over and perhaps , just perhaps , it is over for @entity8 too			1
at 34 and without a new contract having been signed , this may just yet be @entity8 's final act in this competition -- the pinnacle of @entity21 football			2
but if this is to be the end , then he at least went out in style , not that you 'd imagine anything else of course			2
trailing 1 - 0 to @entity29 side @entity28 and facing elimination , @entity8 roused @entity5 one final time with a quite magnificent free kick			1
his curling effort flew over the wall and nestled in the top corner , a strike which will no doubt have the children in the local playgrounds attempting to replicate such a strike			2
that moment rekindled the memories of yesteryear and @entity43 in 2004 where @entity8 produced one of the most iconic moments of his career			2
his 86th minute strike , one of the most ferocious ever unleashed by the midfielder , allowed @entity5 to progress to the last 16 after coming from behind to defeat the @entity52 side 3 - 1			1
that goal was the beginning of @entity5 's incredible run to the 2005 final where it defeated @entity58 on penalties after fighting back from 3 - 0 down at halftime			1
on this occasion , such heroics were to prove beyond him -- not that he should feel responsible			0
far too many of those around him went missing when the club needed it most -- and when @entity69 was sent off after 60 minutes , the task was always going to prove fiendishly difficult			2
" i still knew after i scored that it was going to be difficult with 10 men and running out of time , " @entity8 told @entity70			0
" it gave us some hope and , as the manager said , the first half was not good enough and we had to go down fighting			0
" i have not seen the sending off , but i have heard it was harsh			0
it made it harder because we could have made it hell for @entity28 in the final stages with 11 men			1
" i do n't think we deserved better			0
we have not gone out because of this performance , we were n't good enough away to @entity28 and we let in a silly goal away to @entity89			1
" you qualify over six games and we have not been good enough			0
" @entity5 's highly anticipated return to the @entity14 has been nothing short of an unmitigated disaster			1
one victory from six games , that a last minute triumph against @entity98 minnow @entity89 , is a rather sad indictment of the club 's campaign			2
the reality is that since the sale of @entity105 to @entity106 and the injury to @entity108 , the club 's leading forward , @entity5 have struggled			1
where last season it could do little wrong , now those in red can do little right			0
gone is the pace which brought defenses to its knees , the invention , the effervescence , the enjoyment which was etched across the faces of those in red			0
where feet were once nimble and skipped , they are leaden and clumsy			0
in the @entity126 , @entity5 has won six and lost six of its 15 games and is already 15 points behind leader @entity131			1
@entity133 on @entity21 nights is supposed to be one of the most enchanting football arenas in world football			1
but on this occasion , there was and is nothing magical about this @entity5 side , bar perhaps the cloak of invisibility which seemed to be wrapped up around its tactics and game plan			1
@entity28 , which defeated @entity5 in @entity29 earlier in the competition , deserved their place in the last 16 following an impressive first half performance			1
@entity151 's fine effort which flew past @entity152 , the @entity5 keeper , ensured the visiting side took its advantage into the interval			1
a second goal almost came after the break when @entity159 's fierce drive flew just inches wide of the far post with @entity152 a mere spectator			0
@entity5 , having made two changes at the start of the second half , had hoped for maximum impact from its substitutes			1
instead , what it got was stupidity and petulance			0
@entity69 had only been on the field of play for 15 minutes but when he flicked his hand out towards @entity173 , he was immediately shown the red card			0
while @entity173 's reaction was laughable , @entity69 had no defense -- it was a pathetic end to what had been an impressive 15 minute cameo			0
from there on @entity5 was fighting an uphill battle			1
and yet , as as so often been the case , one man rose to the challenge as he has done on countless occasions throughout the years			0
once again , with his side laying on the canvas , he dragged his teammates to their feet with an outstanding strike			0
just nine minutes of normal time remained when @entity5 was awarded a free kick some 20 - yards from goal			1
@entity8 stood over the ball and with most of those inside @entity133 holding their breath , @entity8 calmly sent the most delectable of efforts sailing over the wall and into the top corner			2
then came the roar , the clenching of fists and the injection of belief which had been so sorely lacking			0
suddenly there was a confidence about @entity5 as it laid siege to the @entity28 goal in a frantic finale			1
those in the @entity210 end tried to suck the ball into the net as the red shirts moved forward at every opportunity			0
@entity217 's header was saved on the line , @entity215 poked wide			0
@entity8 roared his players forward but to no avail			0
" we have to fight going forward to be in this competition next season , " @entity222 , the @entity5 manager , told @entity70			1
" we are not too far off the top four and , if we get there , we will be better in it next season			0
" the possibility of january signings is something to discuss with the owners , but there was a big investment in the summer			0
" we have been unlucky with injuries to key players who are important to the way that we play , but that is to take nothing away from the players tonight who have put everything into the game			0
" elsewhere , @entity245 recorded a club record 19th consecutive victory by defeating @entity98 minnow ludogorets 4 - 0			1
@entity249 and @entity250 were both on target for the @entity253 club which progresses to the next round as the group winner			2
also through to the next stage is @entity253 champion @entity257 which drew 0 - 0 with @entity259 , which qualifies second in @entity260 @entity261 topped @entity262 despite a 1 - 1 draw with @entity264 , while @entity265 finished second after thrashing @entity266 4 - 1 in @entity267			1
in @entity269 , @entity268 defeated @entity270 2 - 0 to claim top spot , one point ahead of @entity273 which finished second after a goalless draw away at @entity275 .			2

@entity5 out of @entity14 following draw with @entity28
@entity29 club records 1 - 1 draw at @entity133
@entity245 makes it six wins out of six
@entity259 qualifies for last - 16 of competition
