-- sen. @entity1 , @entity2 , said monday afternoon that he wo n't seek a third term in the @entity4 -- a major blow to @entity6 worried about losses in the midterm elections			1
" @entity15 is not operating as it should , " @entity1 said at a news conference in @entity10 , adding there 's too much partisanship and " the people 's business is not getting done			2
" @entity1 said he loves public service but does " not love @entity15 " and is " not motivated by strident partisanship or ideology			2
" he cited the @entity4 's recent failure to pass a jobs bill and legislation that would have created a deficit reduction commission as evidence of what he characterized as a broken political system			1
president @entity27 released a statement praising @entity1 for devoting " his career and his life to serving his fellow @entity32			1
" @entity1 , a former two - term governor , was first elected to the @entity4 in 1998 , taking 62 percent of the vote			2
he won re-election with 64 percent six years later			0
in his two terms in the @entity4 , @entity1 cut a centrist path and worked across party lines , which at times frustrated @entity6			1
" he hates the @entity4 , hates the left bloggers , " a friend and longtime adviser to @entity1 said			2
" they are getting their wish , pure @entity6 in the minority			0
" while @entity1 had been mulling retiring for a " good part of last year , " he made his final decision not to seek re-election friday , said another source , who spoke on the condition of anonymity			2
@entity1 was scheduled to appear sunday on @entity0 's " @entity54 , " but his office canceled the appearance late friday afternoon			2
@entity1 is the third @entity57 senator to announce he is retiring when the curtain drops on the 111th @entity15			1
sens. @entity59 of @entity60 and @entity61 of @entity62 previously said they would not seek re-election			0
democrats will have to defend five open seats in november , as @entity67 of @entity68 and @entity69 of @entity70 have said they will not run for their own six - year terms			1
@entity67 was appointed to @entity27 's former @entity4 seat , while @entity74 was appointed to vice president @entity76 's old seat			0
meanwhile , @entity77 will be forced to defend six seats in the midterm elections			1
sens. @entity81 of @entity82 , @entity83 of @entity84 , @entity85 of @entity86 , @entity87 of @entity88 and @entity89 of @entity90 are all retiring at the end of the year			0
sen. @entity92 of @entity93 -- who replaced sen. @entity94 after he resigned before the end of his term -- also will vacate his seat			0
former @entity77 sen. @entity77 recently announced a bid to challenge @entity1 this year			1
@entity77 served from 1989 to 1999 but chose not to run for re-election			2
former rep. @entity101 and state sen. @entity102 also are bidding for the @entity77 @entity4 nomination in @entity2			1
@entity1 probably would have faced a difficult re-election due to the anti-incumbent political climate , but an @entity108 / @entity107 poll conducted in november indicated that 61 percent of @entity2 voters approved of the job the senator he was doing , with 24 percent disapproving			1
@entity1 also had nearly $ 13 million in his campaign war chest			2
he seemed to face the same frustration many former governors experience when they are elected to the @entity4			0
instead of being able to make singular decisions , they find themselves members of a slow - moving legislative body where political lines are dug deep			0
" i 'm an executive at heart , " @entity1 said			0
" i value my independence			0
i 'm not motivated by strident partisanship or ideology			0
these traits may be useful in many walks of life , but they are not highly valued in @entity15			0
" a source noted that @entity1 is unclear about what his next step might be but said he would entertain the idea of becoming a university president , running a private business or heading up a charitable endeavor			1
another source added that @entity1 could consider another bid for @entity2 governor			1
a @entity140 source confirmed @entity1 discussed his retirement with @entity27 well before announcing the decision			1
however , a @entity57 source said @entity1 's announcement took national democrats by surprise			1
the source added that @entity57 reps			0
@entity149 and @entity150 and @entity151 , @entity2 , mayor @entity152 all may consider making bids for the @entity57 @entity4 nomination			1
" i appreciate the support of those @entity32 who have already encouraged me to run for sen. @entity1 's seat , " @entity150 said in a statement			1
" the next step will be taking a few days to talk to my wife and to folks in @entity2 about where i can best serve our state			0
" the deadline for a candidate to submit the required number of signatures to have his or her name placed on the @entity2 primary ballot is noon tuesday			0
but if no candidate meets that goal -- and no @entity174 is expected to do so -- then the @entity171 will be able to choose its nominee			0
@entity1 , a centrist @entity174 , reportedly was considered a possible running mate for @entity27 in 2008			1
@entity1 's father , @entity177 , served three terms in @entity4			0
@entity0 's @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 contributed to this report .			0
