-- @entity1 will never be remembered as the greatest slugger in baseball , or as the greatest third - baseman , and -- despite the recent headlines -- probably not even as the biggest cheater			1
but he will go down in record books for something : having the worst contract in @entity11 professional sports history			1
this is not a title that we hand out lightly , because teams have handed out some doozies over the years			2
@entity17 got $ 135 million over 10 years from the @entity18 , and for that money , they got a quarterback who completed 54 % of his passes and went to prison for animal cruelty			1
@entity25 signed with the @entity26 for $ 30 million , then averaged a grand total of three points a game			1
@entity30 got $ 126 million from the @entity31 and essentially forgot how to pitch			1
@entity32 signed a $ 67 million contract with the @entity34 , but now the goaltender could n't stop a beach ball -- which is an issue because that deal does n't run out until 2021			1
and then , there is @entity40 's deal with the @entity41			2
the money - strapped baseball team in @entity44 is still paying the retired outfielder more than 18 players on their active roster and will continue paying him $ 1.2 million through 2035 ( when @entity40 is 72 ) as part of a mind - blowing buyout deal			1
still : the @entity1 deal tops them all for its sheer size and stupidity			1
on december 13 , 2007 , the @entity55 signed him to a 10 - year , $ 275 million contract loaded with incentives that , five years later , is an anvil on the payroll for even the richest team in baseball			1
why is it the worst ? let us count the ways : 1			0
the @entity55 had a chance to move on			2
they had moved on , in fact , if you believed the strong words that came out of the team 's @entity71 , @entity72 , offices during a tumultuous two weeks			0
@entity74 , who was @entity1 's agent at the time , announced in the middle of a @entity77 game that his client would void the remaining three years and $ 72 million of the massive and ill - fated $ 252 million deal he had signed with the @entity80 as a free agent			1
in some corners of the @entity55 organization , the news was met with a sigh of relief			2
@entity1 was productive in his time with the team , but controversial			2
and he had , at that point , wilted in the postseason			0
the idea that the team would bring him back was scoffed at			0
the @entity80 were still paying $ 7 million a year from the original contract as part of the trade terms to the @entity55 , and @entity96 @entity95 insisted that the team had no intention of losing that subsidy			1
" if a player does n't want us , we do n't want them , " said @entity99 , who had assumed control of the team as his father , @entity101 , had started to decline			0
" that chapter is closed			0
" but @entity1 , who had 54 home runs and 156 rbi in an mvp season in 2007 , was a big star the team wanted for its profitable @entity110 and its new $ 1 billion stadium			1
so that chapter was reopened			0
bringing back @entity1 , in itself , was n't an awful move			2
he was still a productive player in his prime			0
but somehow , the @entity55 were given all the cards in the negotiation and still tossed them face - up onto the table			2
all around baseball , teams were scoffing at the idea of giving @entity1 a reported $ 350 million deal			1
the @entity125 did n't want him			0
the @entity127 did n't want him			0
there were so few landing places , it seemed entirely possible , if not probable , that @entity1 's gamble to opt out of the deal would backfire			1
so what did the @entity55 do ? they crawled back to the table and gave him a raise , a deal that would pay him $ 27.5 million a year with a series of $ 6 million bonuses for climbing up the all - time home run list			1
to quote @entity145 at the time : " ( @entity99 ) wanted @entity1 back so badly that he not only reversed a very loud and public proclamation , he wound up bidding against no one but himself in his mad rush to secure @entity1 's services			1
" all it took was an apology from @entity1 ( who says it does n't pay to say you 're sorry ? ) , and @entity1 had his 10 - year deal			1
his production failed to meet the salary from the start			0
make no mistake : the numbers were very good			0
@entity1 earned $ 95 million in the first three years of his deal , and for that he batted .286 with a .537 slugging percentage , 95 home runs , 256 runs and 328 rbi			1
and the @entity55 won the @entity162 , with @entity1 a driving force during an epic postseason run			1
some will say that one october justified the entire contract			0
still , the decline began quickly			0
in 2011 - 12 , @entity1 missed 103 games to injury and saw his batting average dip to .274 with 34 home runs and just 119 rbi in the two seasons combined			1
despite his 647 career home runs , he was so bad in the postseason last october , @entity55 manager @entity175 dropped him from the lineup entirely , and he has n't played since after offseason hip surgery			1
nobody is sure when he 'll be ready again			0
but the @entity55 still owe @entity1 , who turns 38 next month , $ 28 million in 2014 , $ 21 million in 2015 and $ 20 million each in 2016 and 2017			1
if he ca n't get on the field now , what can the team possibly expect to get from him in his early 40s ? and that does n't even factor in ... 4			0
note that the word scandal is plural here			0
after insisting for years that his success was not a product of the " @entity190 " in baseball , a @entity193 report reveal that he had , in fact , failed a test for illegal substances in 2003			0
@entity197 : @entity1 responds to latest allegations so more than 200 journalists packed a news conference in @entity71 in february 2009 to listen as @entity1 explained that , from 2001 to 2003 , he had used steroids while with the @entity80			2
but only with the @entity80			0
" my mistake was because i was immature and i was stupid , " @entity1 said			2
for a week here , i kept looking for people to blame , and i keep looking at myself			0
" he insisted that he was clean during his time with the @entity55			2
but now , according to an @entity208 report , @entity206 plans to suspend him 100 games for his alleged use of performance - enhancing drugs obtained through a @entity213 - area anti-aging clinic			0
the @entity55 ? disappointed is the word managing general partner @entity215 used			2
" there have no doubt been times when we 've been disappointed in him and we 've conveyed that to him and he understands that , " he said			0
" but look , everybody 's human and everybody makes mistakes			0
if you 've got a guy over the course of 10 years , there 's going to be times any of us make mistakes			2
" it 's a big contract , " @entity99 said			2
" we all hope he 's going to act like a @entity55 and do the best to live up to it			1
" the founder of the clinic , @entity237 , is reportedly set to meet with baseball officials friday			0
does he have enough credibility or evidence to support the suspensions of a reported 20 players ? many people around the sport are n't sure			0
for the @entity55 , the question is something else entirely : if @entity1 actually is suspended , will it be enough to get them out from under the worst contract in professional sports history ? @entity1 denies performance - enhancing drugs reports the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity255			1

@entity255 says @entity1 's contract is the worst in sports history
the @entity55 still must pay him more than $ 90 million over the next four years
@entity1 will be *42* when the contract finally runs out
@entity1 has hit 647 career home runs but has yet to play this season because of injury
