when @entity1 was spotted in the @entity3 crowd at last weekend 's @entity4 vs. @entity6 fight -- his handsome mug given a nice share of screen time -- most of us assumed he was there just as a boxing fan			1

@entity1 , hotelier ? has a nice ring to it			2
and it 's likely the former @entity27 captain knows a thing or two about sheet thread counts given the amount of time he 's logged on the road			0

details on specific projects were n't released but according to @entity15 the partnership will be based around the development of " dining , retail and leisure concepts " at @entity15 properties in @entity21 and @entity47 in @entity22			1
