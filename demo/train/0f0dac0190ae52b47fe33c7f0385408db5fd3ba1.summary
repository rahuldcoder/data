the most deadly @entity2 terrorist attack ever in @entity3 followed weeks of warnings from @entity3 officials that the threat had risen to unprecedented levels			1
late last year @entity3 prime minister @entity8 said his country had never faced a greater terrorist threat			1
officials tell @entity0 the threat of terrorist attack in the @entity14 is greater than at any time since 9/11 because of the emergence of jihadist safe havens in @entity17 and @entity18			1
but no country faces a greater terrorist threat than @entity3 , with support for @entity22 running deep among disenfranchised immigrant communities in the rundown , crime - ridden banlieues that surround many @entity3 cities			1
the numbers tell the story : 390 @entity3 extremists are now fighting with jihadist groups in @entity17 and @entity18 , according to @entity3 officials , with 231 believed to be on their way			1
fifty - one have been killed in suicide bombings and combat			0
and 234 have left the conflict zone , with 185 now back in @entity3			2
since the summer of 2013 , @entity3 police say they have thwarted five terror plots			2
nerves were rattled in the run up to @entity40 after a knife attack in a police station in @entity43 and car - ramming attacks in @entity46 and @entity47 on three consecutive days			0
the @entity43 attack was the only one of the three that was definitively linked to @entity2 terrorism			1
a few days after posting an @entity22 flag on his @entity54 page , @entity56 , a @entity3 - @entity58 extremist , entered a police station in the central @entity3 town of @entity43 on dec. 20 and stabbed several officers before being shot dead			1
@entity22 threats to @entity3 @entity22 has explicitly called for lone - wolf terrorist attacks in @entity3 because of its participation in airstrikes in @entity18 by the @entity67 - led coalition			1
" if you are not able to find an ied or a bullet , then single out the disbelieving @entity67 , @entity3 or any of their allies			2
smash his head with a rock or slaughter him with a knife or run him over with your car or throw him down from a high place or choke him or poison him , " @entity22 spokesman @entity73 stated in an audiotape in september			2
on nov. 19 , three @entity3 @entity22 fighters appeared in a @entity3 language video put out by the group 's propaganda arm , repeating the call for attacks in @entity3			1
one of them stated : " terrorize them and do not allow them to sleep due to fear and horror			0
there are weapons and cars available and targets ready to be hit			0
even poison is available , so poison the water and food of at least one of the enemies of @entity101			0
kill them and spit in their faces and run over them with your cars			0
do whatever you are able to do in order to humiliate them , for they deserve only this			0
" a significant number of the nearly 400 @entity3 nationals now fighting in @entity17 and @entity18 are believed to have joined @entity22			1
that includes @entity117 , a 22 - year - old convert from @entity119 who @entity3 authorities suspect participated in the grisly on - camera beheading of more than a dozen members of the @entity17 armed forces in november orchestrated by the @entity126 " @entity125			2
" @entity3 officials have for some time been worried that those on their way back to @entity3 -- or already back in the country -- could launch attacks			1
in february , police in @entity132 broke up an alleged plot to bomb targets in @entity3 by @entity135 , a @entity3 - @entity137 extremist who had allegedly just returned from fighting with @entity22 in @entity17			1
police say they found almost a kilogram of the high explosive tatp in his family 's @entity132 apartment building			0
@entity135 has denied the allegations against him			0
@entity22 - linked terror on the @entity147 @entity148 , a @entity3 - @entity137 @entity22 fighter who allegedly helped guard @entity150 hostages in @entity17 before returning to @entity151 , allegedly shot and killed four people at a @entity154 museum in @entity155 in may			1
@entity148 was arrested in @entity3 and extradited to face trial in @entity157			2
he has denied the charges			0
in both the @entity132 and @entity155 plots , investigators believe it is possible the men were acting on their own steam			0
no evidence has been publicly released suggesting @entity22 leadership signed off on the plots			2
it is not just isis causing concern to @entity3 security officials			1
@entity151 counterterrorism officials tell @entity0 a relatively high number of @entity3 extremists have joined @entity22 rival @entity173 , @entity174 's affiliate in @entity17			1
of most concern : @entity176 , a @entity3 convert from @entity177 who has emerged as one of the most skilled bomb makers in the @entity181 group , an @entity180 based in @entity17 's @entity183 province with ties to @entity173			2
@entity67 officials tell @entity0 they believe @entity186 has been working on nonmetallic explosive devices that the group hoped to smuggle on board western passenger aircraft and has been talent - spotting @entity151 extremists in @entity17 who can be trained for attacks in @entity151			0
@entity176 was injured in a @entity67 drone strike that hit a vehicle he was traveling in november			0
@entity181 bomb maker thought dead survived new laws , old grievances in november , @entity3 adopted tough new anti-terror legislation making it easier to shut down jihadist websites and confiscate passports and identity cards of those suspected of wanting to travel overseas to fight jihad			0
but critics say the @entity3 government has done too little to tackle one of the key contributing factors to radicalization : the deep sense of alienation toward mainstream society felt by a significant number of young @entity213 immigrants in the banlieues			1
in the years after 9/11 , @entity3 was held up as a model by many for its " assimilationist " agenda and its zero tolerance of extremist radical preachers			1
@entity126 , by contrast , was criticized for a " multicultural " approach that for too long offered political refuge to extremists from around the world			0
but by the late 2000s , @entity2 extremism had also become a significant problem in @entity3			1
although @entity3 leaders paid lip service to assimilation , the concept was only theoretical for young unemployed @entity213 living in impoverished banlieues whose socioeconomic grievances were more acute than their counterparts in the @entity126			0
while @entity3 could crack down on radical preachers in the 1990s , it was powerless to prevent the growth of jihadist websites and social media in the second half of the 2000s			0
@entity243 in @entity17 has become a " cause celebre " for @entity3 extremists able to access this content online			0
while many @entity126 extremists traveled to @entity174 's safe havens in @entity249 and @entity250 in the years before and after 9/11 because of their language and kinship ties to the region , much of @entity3 's banlieue population hails from @entity255 , making travel to jihadist battlegrounds in the @entity259 world easier and more attractive .			2
