@entity0 , @entity1 -- health and hospital officials in @entity1 braced for the worse monday , fearing the hurricane that battered the @entity8 nation over the weekend could worsen the cholera outbreak that has killed hundreds of people and hospitalized thousands since it began last month			1
the official death toll attributed to the outbreak was 544 , with more than 8,000 confirmed cases , health minister @entity11 told @entity2			1
on monday , dr. @entity15 of @entity16 confirmed the first case of cholera -- in a 3 - year - old boy -- to originate and manifest entirely in @entity0			1
previous cases had been centered in @entity1 's @entity22 and @entity23 regions , including the city of @entity25 , north of the nation 's capital			1
until now , health officials said that those being treated for cholera in @entity0 all contracted the disease elsewhere			1
the young @entity0 boy lived in a tent city across the street from a place that sells macaroni , and he had not traveled in over a year nor had he had contact with people from @entity25 or the @entity22 region , dr. @entity15 said			2
after suffering from nausea and diarrhea , the boy was treated and released from the hospital after his condition improved			2
this was one of scores of tests being carried out on 91 residents of the capital -- all of whom live in or near the city 's densely populated @entity53 slum , @entity11 said			2
except for one person who died over the weekend , all the others have recovered , he said			0
@entity60 ' trek past @entity1 killed 20 people and injured another 36 , a @entity58 official said monday			1
seven people were missing and 5,954 were homeless , the official said			2
health officials fear that the water dumped by the storm will worsen the outbreak			0
the concern is that overflow from latrines and septic tanks could contaminate the supply of fresh drinking water and contribute to the spread of the bacteria			0
in the capital , the canals were not overflowing , said @entity78 spokeswoman @entity77			0
but that was not the case in cities west of the capital , which bore the brunt of @entity60 , she said			0
still , even @entity0 looks and smells like a dump -- a caldron of water , garbage and human waste			2
" we get used to it , " said one resident			0
ten months after a magnitude - 7 earthquake laid waste to much of the nation , people compete with animals scavenging through the ubiquitous dumps for scraps of food			0
" the quick solution is management , " said environment minister @entity99			1
" management meaning that you have a structure in place , but the structure was not conceived with the slums in mind			0
" but most of the residents of @entity0 live in slums			1
" we 're working on it , " @entity99 said			1
" we will work with the private sector			0
