-- one of the prosecution 's final witnesses , @entity2 's mother took the stand again tuesday in her daughter 's capital murder trial , breaking into tears from time to time as she discussed items found with the remains of her 2 - year - old granddaughter , @entity2			1
the prosecution plans to rest its case wednesday , prosecutor @entity12 told @entity16 chief judge @entity15 the defense was unable to move its first few witnesses , @entity15 said , and will begin its case thursday			1
@entity2 began crying when a photograph of @entity2 wearing a shirt reading " big trouble comes in small packages " was introduced into evidence			1
previous testimony has suggested that scraps of the shirt were found at the scene along with @entity2 's skeletal remains			1
@entity2 said she did most of the laundry at the home , and " i do n't ever remember seeing that shirt			1
" she also identified photographs of objects similar to canvas laundry bags she said were in the @entity37 home and said that @entity2 had a @entity40 blanket but that she had not seen the blanket since the end of may , before @entity2 disappeared			1
a canvas laundry bag and @entity40 blanket were found with the little girl 's remains			0
@entity2 's testimony followed that of a long line of investigators and forensic experts , called to the stand in the @entity52 courtroom in an effort to support prosecutors ' theory that @entity2 , 25 , killed her daughter by knocking her out with chloroform and putting duct tape over her nose and mouth			1
they allege she then put the little girl 's body in black garbage bags and stored it in her trunk before dumping it in woods near her home			0
@entity2 's skeletal remains were found in december 11 , 2008			1
she was last seen june 16 , 2008 , but her disappearance was not reported until july 15 , 2008 , after @entity2 demanded answers from her daughter about @entity2 's whereabouts			1
@entity37 faces seven counts in @entity2 's death , including first - degree murder , aggravated child abuse and misleading investigators			1
if convicted , she could face the death penalty			0
she has pleaded not guilty			0
her attorneys have said @entity2 was not killed but rather drowned in the family pool on june 16			1
defense attorney @entity83 told jurors that @entity2 and her father , @entity37 , panicked when they discovered the body and covered up her death			1
@entity37 rejected that scenario in his testimony the first week of the trial			0
@entity2 testified tuesday that duct tape was also in the home , stored in the garage , but she could not recall making a previous statement that duct tape was used at a command center after @entity2 went missing			1
@entity83 pointed out that in a july 2009 deposition , @entity2 was asked whether @entity2 had removed any duct tape from the home while out of jail on bond and said she did n't think so , as the family had only one roll and her husband was using it			1
@entity2 explained that at the time , both she and her husband were using the tape on " no trespassing " signs on their property because of protesters outside			1
the final witness of the day was @entity112 , a tattoo artist who applied a tattoo to @entity2 -- " @entity114 , " @entity115 for " beautiful life " -- on july 2 , during the time @entity2 was missing but before her disappearance was reported to police			1
@entity112 testified that @entity37 did not appear to be upset and did not mention @entity2			1
he said he spoke to her again july 15 , when she came into the shop to make an appointment for herself and a friend for july 19			0
she mentioned at the time that @entity2 was with the nanny but would be with her july 19 , @entity112 said			1
a host of witnesses including @entity37 's former boyfriend , friends and acquaintances have testified that @entity37 was not upset and did not mention her missing daughter in the 31 days before police were notified the little girl had disappeared			2
@entity37 told authorities afterward that she had been frantically searching for her daughter during that month			2
after @entity112 ' testimony , @entity37 's defense team moved for a mistrial on several grounds , including the fact that prosecutors asked @entity112 whether she seemed remorseful , although @entity15 did not allow @entity112 to answer			2
prosecutor @entity12 countered that the question came in response to @entity83 's asking @entity112 whether customers do not often get tattoos to remember departed loved ones			0
@entity15 denied the mistrial motion			0
defense attorneys said they will move for acquittal when the prosecution rests			2
earlier tuesday , @entity151 forensic examiner @entity150 said that neither @entity37 nor @entity2 could be excluded as the source of a hair found in @entity37 's trunk			1
@entity150 said she subjected a portion of the hair to mitochondrial dna testing			0
such testing is used , she told jurors , when a specimen such as hair or skeletal remains may not contain enough nuclear dna for testing			0
nuclear dna , she said , is inherited from both parents and can identify a person to the exclusion of all others			0
mitochondrial dna is inherited from a person 's mother , and testing shows whether a person can not be excluded as the source of evidence -- along with their mother , their siblings and anyone else in the maternal family line			0
@entity150 said she compared the hair portion to cheek swabs from @entity37 and found that they matched			0
she said she would not expect to see that @entity157 type in more than .26 % of the @entity186 - @entity185 population , 1.85 % of the @entity188 population and .39 % of the @entity190 population			2
she also acknowledged that the testing could not exclude @entity37 's mother , @entity2 ; her brother , @entity193 ; or any maternal uncles as the source of the hair			1
@entity150 also testified tuesday that she tested the " hair mass " found with @entity2 's remains and found that it shared the same mitochondrial dna type as the hair in the trunk			1
on cross-examination , @entity83 attempted to question @entity150 , over numerous objections from prosecutors , about whether she was aware that @entity193 owned the car before his sister			0
@entity150 said she did not recall seeing the name @entity193 in the communications she was given about the case			2
@entity2 also took the stand tuesday and told prosecutor @entity212 that she has bleached her hair blonde for years			1
she said that @entity2 has also highlighted her hair off and on and that @entity193 has always kept his hair short			2
she said @entity2 's hair was never colored or processed			2
@entity151 trace evidence examiner @entity217 previously testified that a 9 - inch piece of hair from the trunk appeared similar to a piece of hair recovered from the little girl 's hairbrush and was not similar to @entity2 's hair			1
@entity2 said that it was possible her mother had been in the car and that her hair , a mixture of blonde , brown , white and gray , has been shoulder - length for years			1
following @entity150 to the stand tuesday was @entity237 , an @entity238 crime scene examiner who helped process the scene where @entity2 's remains were found and helped execute a search warrant at the @entity37 home			2
@entity237 identified photographs of several sheets of heart - shaped stickers found at the home , as well as the sheets themselves , with some stickers missing			2
on monday , an @entity151 latent print examiner testified that adhesive in the shape of a heart was found on a corner of a piece of duct tape that was covering the mouth portion of @entity2 's remains			2
@entity259 explained the find to jurors by asking them to think about when they remove an adhesive bandage from their skin and some of the adhesive remains in the shape of the bandage			0
instead of a bandage , however , the outline was the shape of a heart , she said , and about the size of a dime			0
a sticker was also found at the site where @entity2 's remains were discovered on a small piece of cardboard			2
an @entity151 analysis showed that sticker did not match those found at the @entity37 home			0
asked by @entity83 whether she found a sticker like that in the home , @entity237 said she did not			0
jurors sent a note to @entity15 on tuesday asking to see the photograph of the sticker recovered from the crime scene			0
@entity15 granted that request but made clear to jurors that the sticker has since separated from the cardboard			0
@entity259 said monday that she found the heart - shaped adhesive while examining the three pieces of duct tape found on @entity2 's remains for fingerprints			1
she said she did n't find fingerprints but did n't expect to , given the months the tape and the remains had been outdoors and exposed to the elements			0
any oil or sweat from a person 's fingertips would have long since deteriorated , she said			0
@entity15 told jurors monday testimony in the case could conclude by the end of next week , although he can not say for sure			2
deliberations could begin by june 25 , he said			0
@entity312 , the meter reader who discovered @entity2 's remains , has been subpoenaed by the defense , his attorney , @entity318 , said tuesday			1
he was not given a date to appear in court , @entity318 said			0
in @entity322 's @entity321 and @entity323 contributed to this report			0
watch @entity325 monday through sunday starting at 8 p.m. et on @entity326			0
