-- most of the muckraking @entity3 movies we think of as classic tend to sketch their dramas inside very clean and satisfying moral lines			0
" @entity17 " was about a feisty union organizer fighting for basic workers ' rights , " @entity13 " was about two fearless newspaper reporters bringing down a corrupt president , and " @entity16 " was about a heroic ordinary woman battling corporate malfeasance			0
" @entity25 , " a drama about the quasi-disaster that is today 's @entity21 public education system , would very much like to be a " @entity17 " - style lump - in - the - throat rabble rouser , and to a good degree it succeeds			1
yet the movie — to its credit — never denies the murky complexity of what 's gone wrong in our schools			1
the moral lines here are by no means clean or easy to read			0
the film rightly pins our educational malaise on a great many diverse causes , from students mired in videogames to bad teachers to overly stodgy curriculum to good teachers who have sunk , over the years , into a kind of grinding hopelessness that just about anyone in their position might share			0
the movie is set in @entity48 , where @entity50 , a financially strapped single mother played by @entity51 ( she works as a bartender as well as an auto - lot secretary ) , learns that her dyslexic daughter , @entity55 ( @entity54 ) , has been stuck in a dead - end classroom at @entity57 , one of the lowest - rated schools in the city			1
after failing to win a coveted spot in a school lottery ( a heartbreaking scene that sets the film 's tone of hope teetering on rickety opportunities for success ) , @entity50 decides to mount a fight to improve the school she 's stuck with			2
but it 's not because she gives a damn about being a '' crusader			2
'' she 's acting out of a sheer , desperate , practical desire to get her daughter a decent education			2
she teams up with a gifted but morosely worn - down veteran teacher at @entity57 , @entity80 ( @entity81 ) , who is trying to dig herself out of her own hole of apathy			1
and together , these two ignite a local movement to re-launch the school with a new , progressive program			0
they have to jump through a nightmarish array of bureaucratic hoops , which the film portrays in agonizing detail			0
they also have to take on the teachers ' union , represented by @entity95 as a manipulative idealist who does n't realize how much her own cherished orthodoxies have , over the years , become part of the problem			0
" @entity25 " has already attracted its share of heat from the nation 's teachers ' unions , so let me say up front that the movie does n't demonize the union so much as it recognizes the point that director @entity112 made powerfully in his 2010 documentary waiting for '' @entity114 '' : that what the union now stands for — among other things , many of them good — is a lack of change			1
and " @entity25 " says that whatever your feelings about the subject , lack of change can not be the answer to our public - education crisis			1
trying to cram an informational exposé and a vintage inspirational awards - bait weeper into one movie , " @entity25 " is awkward at times , yet it 's also passionate in a surprisingly smart way			1
it makes a genuine drama out of impossible issues			0
it is also , for the most part , very nicely acted			0
@entity51 brings perhaps a bit too much movie - star - as - working - class - mom radiance to her role , yet she also makes you feel the agony of what @entity50 is up against : the terror that her daughter is going to be doomed from grade school on			1
@entity149 , as the chief @entity48 school administrator , does an incisive and witty turn as an ice - cold bureaucrat who still has a trace of fire in her belly , and @entity81 , in a brilliantly felt and thought - out performance , makes @entity80 by turns contained , furious , depressed , and stubbornly on point			1
@entity160 goes way beyond noble - educator sanctimony to show you the tug - of - war between devotion and despair that now defines too many of our teachers			2
" @entity25 " digs into such a complicated , no - easy - solution subject that i doubt the film will attract a very big audience , despite its genuine rouser of a climactic scene set at a school - board meeting			1
yet it actually goes a step further than many of @entity3 's topical dramas by leaving you with something real			2
