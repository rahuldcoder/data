-- " what good does it do to be able to eat at a lunch counter if you ca n't buy a hamburger ? " @entity5 asked almost 50 years ago			0
as we celebrate @entity5 's birthday , recall the historic struggle for equality and reflect on the progress we 've made , we ca n't forget that a basic tenet of the movement @entity5 represented was one of economic security			2
for millions of @entity16 women and their families -- especially women of color -- the aspiration of equal rights coupled with full economic opportunity is far from realized			1
on @entity23 , helping the unemployed is a moral issue today , one in three @entity16 lives at or below the poverty line , and almost 70 % are women and children			1
that 's 42 million women inching along poverty 's tightrope			1
the number of working poor struggling to lift themselves into the middle class is steadily increasing , with the worst poverty rates falling on black and @entity38 women			2
a new report just released , the @entity40 : a woman 's nation pushes back from the @entity43 , illuminates this economic plight that is seizing millions of @entity16 women but is frequently overlooked in our national discussions about poverty and inequality			1
women represent nearly two - thirds of minimum wage workers , concentrated in jobs that tend to be labor - intensive			0
they go without paid sick days or access to affordable child care			0
moreover , women across the spectrum continue to earn less than men no matter the education level , profession or position -- a wage gap that is more like a gulf for women of color who earn 55 to 65 cents on the dollar compared with white men			0
to fight poverty , start with women add to this picture that 40 % of our nation 's households with children rely on women as a primary or sole source of income , and it becomes easier to understand why it is so hard for many families to get ahead			1
what 's clear is that the @entity16 family has changed			0
no longer are we a " @entity85 " nation			1
only one in five families today has a parent in the workforce and another who stays at home with the kids			1
women are increasingly primary breadwinner and primary caregiver , and the nation has not kept pace with this reality			2
our approach to families , in public policy and in the workplace , is decidedly 20th century			0
we need to push forward a 21st century policy agenda that acknowledges women are playing these critical dual roles			0
the greatest @entity5 speeches you have never heard for starters , it 's past time we adopt nationwide paid family leave and paid sick day policies -- now standard in most developed countries -- so that women do n't have to make the impossible choice between providing needed family care and feeding the family			2
we also need to close the gender wage gap , which would cut the poverty rate in half for working women and their families and add nearly a half trillion dollars to the national economy			1
raising the minimum wage would provide women who labor in jobs caring for others ' families with greater economic resources to care for their own			1
access to quality , affordable child care not only allows mothers to work all year , it also gives them the chance to further their education , which is a key gateway to the middle class			0
legislation has been proposed in @entity138 on all of these issues , so the time to act is now			0
as we chart the course for the next generation of change , addressing the economic crisis facing women -- particularly low - income women and women of color -- must be front and center			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity151 .			0
