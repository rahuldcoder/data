-- @entity0 created the @entity1 with data supplied by the @entity3 , which takes on the gargantuan task of compiling the average wage of the world , as well as individual countries			1
the @entity3 collects this data by sending out annual questionnaires to countries ' national statistical authorities and also trying to collect it directly from national statistical authorities ' publicly available information			1
they ca n't cover the entire world -- some countries do n't supply or have the information -- but this interactive uses data which counts for 93 % of the globe 's employees			1
however , there are some important caveats			1
the total employed population is broken into two groups			0
employees who earn a wage , and the self - employed who earn what the @entity3 calls " employment - related income			1
" the @entity3 does not include the latter because what is earned as a " wage " and what is earned as " profit " and reinvested in the company is hard to untangle and could therefore confuse the concepts			1
the share of employees in total employment varies across the world			0
in most developed economies , employees represent about 85 % of total employment			0
however , in developing countries this is much less			0
in @entity48 , for example , employees are on average about 30 % of total employment			0
this means the average wage as calculated by the @entity3 will not always capture what an average family lives on , particularly as self - employed workers in developing countries can earn much less than wage earners			1
@entity57 is also a special case			0
there is information on public wages and private wages , but nothing which combines the two			0
because the percentage split is unclear , the @entity3 keeps the data points separate			2
the concept of an " average wage " is also imperfect because inequality has increased across the globe , and the percentage of low paid workers has increased in a substantial number of countries			1
however , global distribution figures still show how the majority of people in the world are still earning far less than the wealthy minority			1
the data also comes from different years , as some countries do n't send their data to the @entity3 as regularly as others			2
however , with wages stagnant in recent years , at least in developed economies , the differences are likely to be small			0
you can see what year your data comes from in the blurb comparing your wage to the average in your country			2
in order to be able to compare wages globally , they are converted into what 's called a " purchasing power parity " @entity98 dollar			1
this uses a 2012 @entity101 conversion rate to weight wages relative to the buying power of $ 1 inside the @entity98 however , the comparison is not perfect because the definition of wages can vary from one country to the next			1
the $ @entity109 figure reveals the buying power of what you earn , inside your country , relative to the spending power of someone in the @entity98 the @entity115 data is presented as an indicator of global wages			1
@entity118 and the @entity119 are excluded because comparable data is not available			0
the representative jobs @entity0 chose were in the main guided by data the @entity3 had in hand , for reasons of consistency			2
the wages used by @entity0 can be found on the @entity3 website here , as can the years it is available			2
the @entity98 chief executive and @entity133 @entity132 data comes from public records and were selected to represent those on relatively higher incomes			2
the queen 's income is what she receives to carry out her public duties			0
she also has private income			0
this interactive was put together with assistance from @entity144 , one of the co-authors of the @entity146			0
opinion : why @entity149 's unemployment ills need urgent economic medicine opinion : our predatory capitalist system need not be a zero - sum game quest : @entity156 and its dictionary diplomacy			0

the @entity3 compiles the average wage of the world
the data comes with important caveats , including how many people are " employees "
global wages are compared by converting into " purchasing power parity " dollars
this shows how much your earnings buy you compared to someone earning in the @entity98
