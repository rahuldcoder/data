-- this bizarre - looking concoction of glass , liquid and tubes could one day bring a whole new meaning to the idea of natural lighting			2
the new " bio-light " concept designed by @entity11 electronics company @entity9 creates light in the same way that bioluminescent living organisms like fireflies and glow worms do			1
the phenomenon of bioluminescence is created by a chemical reaction where an enzyme called luciferase interacts with a light - emitting molecule called luciferin			0
in the bio-light a collection of hand - blown jars -- held in place by a steel frame -- contain a measure of bioluminescent bacteria which glow green when fed methane gas -- in this case through individual silicon tubes routed through a household waste digester			1
harnessing these biological techniques could help redefine how we consume energy in the home , says @entity9			1
" designers have an obligation to explore solutions which are by nature less energy - consuming and non-polluting , " says @entity40 , senior director of design - led innovation at @entity42			0
" we need to push ourselves to rethink domestic appliances entirely , how homes consume energy and how entire communities can pool their resources , " @entity40 said in a statement			0
@entity55 , a plant biologist from the @entity57 's @entity56 says the bio-light is a very provocative idea			1
" it 's appealing because it brings two things together which you would n't normally associate , " @entity55 said			0
" i do n't think you want to imagine that everyone 's going to start putting bacterial cultures into their own home for lighting but as a way of exploring the idea it 's quite interesting , " he added			2
it part of a wider swing to sustainable technologies , @entity55 says , but he does n't see bioluminescent lights competing with led and other low - energy lights in the future			0
" when you move out of the normal ( lighting ) area -- illuminated walkways and things like that -- where things could essentially be growing and delivering light for free , that 's where you 're going to have applications			0
" @entity9 envisages similar applications , perhaps using glowing plants to illuminate road verges or as warning strips on flights of stairs			2
it also says these same bioluminescence techniques could be used as a diagnostic indicator of pollution levels or even as a biosensor for monitoring diseases like diabetes			0
@entity9 says the bio-light would be more suited to providing mood lighting than " functional illumination			1
" it forms part of a wider @entity42 's @entity110 project which imagines an " integrated cyclical ecosystem " in the home where traditional waste is recycled to address sustainability issues .			1
