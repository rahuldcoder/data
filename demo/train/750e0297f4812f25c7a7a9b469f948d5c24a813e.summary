@entity0 , @entity1 -- multicolor blankets and clothes draped over rusty railings serve as a signpost that you 've reached the @entity9 community on the outskirts of town			1
disheveled children squeal as they chase one young girl who is gripping a plastic doll with synthetic blond hair			0
they jump around chanting : " we want @entity16			1
" until last week , these were the knee - high playmates of " @entity16 , " the mystery blond child discovered during last week 's police raid on this community			1
after dna tests showed they were no relation , the couple who were posing as her parents , @entity26 and @entity27 , were charged with kidnapping			1
they deny those accusations and say the birth mother was destitute and unable to care for the baby			0
the police raid , the accusations of kidnapping and the subsequent media coverage has incensed @entity9 residents at this community in central @entity1			1
the same day our @entity2 crew pulled up at the gates , we 'd had word that another international tv team had been roughed up by @entity9 men			1
@entity46 woman claims she 's @entity16 's mom a lot of @entity1 and international coverage of the case has been fueled by stereotypes and old wives ' tales , in part portraying the @entity54 as untrustworthy , thieves and even child snatchers			1
press reports even prompted a stiff warning from @entity60 human rights watchdog , the @entity59			0
in a written statement it said : " " such irresponsible reporting can have tremendous effects on the lives of millions of @entity9 and fuel already widespread violent @entity68 movements			1
" although the @entity9 are no more inclined to criminal behavior than anybody else , media insistence on mentioning ethnicity in news reports gives credence to the myth that @entity9 are by nature criminals			1
" on the outer margins of society it was already dusk when we arrived			0
before we could even start to try and get the facts of a complex case straight , we had to persuade the @entity9 to tolerate us , if not welcome us into their community			1
even in the best of times , @entity9 view outsiders with deep distrust			1
in @entity1 , they call @entity88 " balame			2
" centuries of persecution , including thousands gassed in @entity92 's death camps , has pushed the @entity9 to the outer margins of @entity60 society			1
the @entity94 estimates that of about 12 million @entity9 spread across @entity60 , almost 90 % survive below the poverty line			2
photo blog : plight of the @entity9 here in @entity0 's @entity9 community , no one we talked to had regular jobs			1
some traveled from town to town selling fruit and vegetables			0
those who had previously picked up farm jobs at harvest time said they were having a tough time because @entity112 and @entity46 were coming in and working for as little as 10 euros a day , way cheaper than the @entity9			2
resident @entity113 conceded some of the youngsters did bend the law as they battled to survive @entity1 's economic meltdown			1
but like his neighbors , he vehemently denied anyone here was involved in serious crime , much less child trafficking			0
" people just do n't have enough to eat ; what can they do ? ten or 15 years ago , this was n't the case			0
now they do n't have enough food , and they go crazy , " he said			0
an invitation to visit a @entity9 family before we left the @entity9 community that evening , we had managed to talk our way into a lunch invitation the next day with his wife , @entity140 , and part of her extended family , which included four children and nine grandchildren			1
@entity113 had supported them for the past 37 years playing clarinet at weddings and christenings			0
but amid @entity1 's economic meltdown , his bookings were scare			1
" what can you do ? it 's a general problem but i can only hope we can get by , " he said			0
over lunch , @entity140 explained to us that she , like most of her neighbors , knew @entity16 and the couple who cared for her			1
she rejected any suggestions she had been mistreated			0
" it 's a good family			0
i 've known them for many years ; we practically grew up together			0
@entity26 used to sell potatoes and fruit and @entity27 would come here for coffee and bring the little girl , " she said			0
@entity140 said she had never met @entity16 's birth mother but understood she was @entity46			1
she recalls @entity16 came to the camp possibly five years ago			2
authorities estimate @entity16 may be 5 or 6			2
almost as she was speaking , the lunchtime tv news reported the latest on the case			0
her daughter @entity175 burst into tears and stopped sobbing only long enough to curse what she called " police and media lies			0
" " @entity16 was raised very well			1
she used to bring her here nicely dressed			0
she was n't skinny but well - fed. @entity27 took more care of her than her own children , " she said			0
after lunch , we wandered through the narrow alleys that separated the metal , prefabricated huts that made up the community			0
a short distance away , @entity190 stopped pushing a rickety green cart she used to collect firewood			0
she , too , had known @entity16			2
" @entity16 used to play here with the other children and go to the store with her mum			2
@entity16 was not hidden away , " she explained			2
" her real mother gave her away , and @entity27 was enchanted by @entity16 's beauty			1
she shared the food for her own children with @entity16			2
" among @entity1 @entity9 , a blue - eyed , blond child like @entity16 is a relative rarity			1
those familiar with @entity9 customs here say having a fair - skinned child is seen as good luck			2
in fact , @entity16 and her adoptive parents did not live in the metal huts partly funded by the @entity94 a decade ago			2
their home was a few hundred meters away in a brick and concrete house			0
inside a child 's bedroom initially , @entity9 who said they were just looking after the house shooed us away and asked us not to film			1
later , they recanted and invited us in			0
they showed us a spacious room they said had been @entity16 's bedroom			1
stuffed animals were laid out on a pink quilt and a coloring book lay open on the floor			0
their intention seemingly was to show @entity16 had been well cared for , but it also seemed unlikely that @entity16 would have had a room to herself in a one - bedroom house that was also home to 13 other children			2
outside , @entity230 , son - in - law of the woman who raised @entity16 , spoke briefly to us			1
" @entity16 was the most beautiful of babies			2
her @entity46 mother left the girl here and my mother in law raised her			0
" she had five children already and could n't raise one more			0
originally she left @entity242 only for a short while but she never came back to get the baby , " he added			0
a half - hour drive away in the town of @entity248 , we found @entity249 , defense lawyer for the @entity9 couple			1
he said relatives of the family were searching for @entity16 's biological mother			1
on thursday , some of those relatives headed to @entity46 but could not immediately be contacted by phone			0
" from the outset , we have said finding @entity16 's mother is the key to this case			1
we are not afraid of what she has to say , " @entity249 told @entity2 over coffee at a pavement cafe			2
almost as he spoke , @entity46 police reported they had questioned a @entity9 couple in central @entity46 who claimed they were @entity16 's biological parents			1
dna tests have now been scheduled before the weekend , police say , to see if they can resolve the mystery of who is @entity16 and whether she was the victim of child traffickers or simple the daughter of parents trapped by poverty .			0

@entity9 couple has been charged with kidnapping little blond " @entity16 , " who they have raised
a crew with @entity2 visits the @entity9 community in @entity1 where @entity16 was found
@entity9 view outsiders with deep distrust even in the best of times
they describe a life of *hardship* since @entity1 's meltdown but say @entity16 was treated well
