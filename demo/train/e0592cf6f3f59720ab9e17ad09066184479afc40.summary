-- a recent @entity2 study found that the longer couples are married , the less they have to say to each other over the course of an hour - long meal			1
in other words , the social scientists assigned data to one of my greatest fears : that my husband and i will become the couple in the restaurant eating together , but not saying a word to each other except , " pass the salt			1
" 6 friends every mom needs how bad does it get ? listen to these numbers : couples who are dating chat for 50 minutes out of the hour			1
presumably , breathing , eating and imbibing take up the remaining 10 minutes			2
immediately after marriage , the downward trend kicks in , with the time spent talking dropping to 40 minutes per hour			1
twenty years into marriage , the average couple talks for 21 minutes of the hour ; 30 years in , conversation takes up 16 minutes			1
and by 50 years of marital bliss , the average couple converses for three minutes in an hour ! that 's 150 words or less in an entire meal ! i 'm guessing " are you still breathing ? " takes up most of the conversation time			1
@entity0 : unexpected benefits of giving your relationship a cleanup no wonder @entity43 and @entity44 are going their separate ways after 40 years ; they only have about five minutes of conversation a day ! who would n't want to go back to the chatty days of dating ? and , to do that , apparently , you have to be dating , so time to ditch the spouse			1
@entity0 : is your marriage good - enough ? 10 questions to ask i , on the other hand , would like to stay married -- but not in silence			1
after absorbing the findings in the @entity2 study , i took a long look at how much conversation my husband of 17 years and i engage in during a typical weeknight dinner , on the rare night when we have dinner together			1
if you take away the discussion about youth sports logistics , homework plans , trips to the vet and what to add to the grocery list , we are pretty much down to " pass the salt			0
" yes , we are the couple in the restaurant even when we are sitting in our home			2
@entity0 : the 5 - point marriage checklist time to reverse the trend , i 've decided			2
i 've made a list of interests to cultivate over the next 20 years , so my husband and i do n't run out of the little conversation we have left when the kids leave the house and we are stuck with each other			2
sports i picked sports over politics because it still has the same intrigue and passion but not the potential to lead to fights and hurt feelings			0
and , there are so many sports and only two real political parties , so the variety of topics is greater			0
i 'm researching esoteric sports like archery and skeeball to throw into the mix during the @entity106 off - season			0
@entity0 : the woman 's guide to understanding football food i have resisted becoming one of those annoying foodies who question the " origin " of their vegetables at every meal , but now i am rethinking my position			0
if talking about field greens will save my marriage , i 'm willing to indulge			2
historical @entity119 we had a house guest last year that participated in historical reenactments of @entity125 battles			0
seriously , this lovely man never stopped talking the entire weekend about his alter ego , a @entity129 foot soldier			0
i 'm not really that into the @entity125 , but again , if assuming the identity of a battlefield nurse in 1862 will keep my husband and i conversing , i 'll give it a go			2
