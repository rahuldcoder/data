president @entity1 and other world leaders have decided to end @entity4 's role in the group of leading industrialized nations , the @entity0 said monday			1
the move to suspend @entity4 's membership in the @entity9 is the latest direct response from major countries allied against @entity4 's annexation of @entity13			1
" international law prohibits the acquisition of part or all of another state 's territory through coercion or force , " the statement said			0
" to do so violates the principles upon which the international system is built			0
we condemn the illegal referendum held in @entity13 in violation of @entity29 's constitution			2
" we also strongly condemn @entity4 's illegal attempt to annex @entity13 in contravention of international law and specific international obligations			1
" @entity4 foreign minister @entity34 said earlier in the day that being kicked out of @entity9 would be no big deal			1
" @entity9 is an informal organization that does not give out any membership cards and , by its definition , can not remove anyone , " he said during a news conference			2
" all the economic and financial questions are decided in @entity43 , and @entity9 has the purpose of existence as the forum of dialogue between the leading @entity49 countries and @entity4			1
" @entity34 added that @entity4 was " not attached to this format and we do n't see a great misfortune if it will not gather			2
maybe , for a year or two , it will be an experiment for us to see how we live without it			0
" @entity29 orders @entity13 troop withdrawal in a nod to political and economic reforms , the @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , and @entity64 added @entity4 to their group in 1998 -- transforming it from the @entity67 to the @entity9			1
an aide to @entity59 prime minister @entity69 confirmed to @entity70 that a group summit initially planned for june in @entity72 , @entity4 , where the @entity73 were just held , is now off			2
the @entity58 and its allies in @entity75 are " united in imposing a cost on @entity4 for its actions so far , " @entity1 said earlier in the @entity78 where he attended a nuclear security summit with other world leaders			1
western powers have imposed sanctions and other penalties against specific people in @entity4 close to president @entity86			2
a senior @entity1 administration official , not speaking for full attribution , said @entity1 and other leaders agreed that further steps to punish @entity4 president @entity86 could include sanctions on energy , banking and defense sectors -- all areas where @entity75 is deeply engaged economically with @entity4			1
those additional sanctions could be prompted if @entity4 further escalates its incursion into @entity29 , which the official defined as sending troops beyond @entity13 into the southern or eastern parts of the country			1
violence in the contested peninsula could also trigger further sanctions			0
while the official said further penetration of @entity29 by @entity4 troops remains the most immediate source of concern for the @entity58 , other potential land grabs also worry the @entity58 and its allies			1
@entity113 has expressed concern @entity4 could attempt to reclaim a region of @entity115 with @entity4 sympathies			2
can @entity1 's @entity75 trip re-assert @entity58 global leadership ? @entity1 has said a military incursion in @entity29 is off the table , and his advisers are hesitant to even frame the crisis in @entity29 as a bad ' 80s flashback -- @entity1 in one corner , @entity86 in the other			1
it 's not " @entity128 , " as secretary of state @entity127 said			0
@entity0 officials do n't care to publicly muse about @entity86 's intentions			0
national security adviser @entity131 said the @entity4 president 's actions speak for themselves			2
the @entity0 emphasis throughout the @entity4 occupation of @entity13 has been " de-escalation			1
" asked whether the @entity58 will provide military aid to @entity29 's woefully underfunded armed forces , administration officials cautioned that such assistance could inflame tensions			2
" our focus has been and remains on the economic and diplomatic instruments at this point , " @entity141 said			0
" our interest is not in seeing the situation escalate and devolve into hot conflict			0
" @entity34 met with @entity127 on monday and said @entity4 's action in @entity13 was necessary			1
" it was the necessity to protect @entity4 who live there and who lived there for centuries , " he said in the news conference			0
" and when our partners compare @entity13 to @entity159 , because in @entity159 a lot of blood was shed then its independence was proclaimed			0
so we have a question then : is it necessary for the blood to be shed in @entity13 to agree on the right of the people in @entity13 for self - determination ? " while @entity170 and @entity171 lawmakers in the @entity58 are stepping up their calls to provide @entity29 with light arms and other military aid , administration officials have argued that sanctions put in place so far must be given time to take hold			1
with an estimated 20,000 @entity4 troops on @entity29 's border , the question is whether @entity1 's use of soft power will deter @entity86			1
with little resistance , the @entity4 president could easily move into eastern @entity29 even as @entity1 seeks to isolate @entity186 in meetings with @entity75 allies			1
it 's a possibility not lost on senior administration officials			0
@entity192 chairman @entity191 , a @entity193 @entity171 , argued the @entity4 leader is likely eying more opportunities in the coming days			0
" ( @entity86 ) has put all the military units he would need to move into @entity29 on its eastern border and is doing exercises			0
we see him moving forces in the south in a position where they could take the southern region over to @entity115 , " @entity191 said on @entity200 's " @entity199			0
" there are other approaches			0
@entity1 's former ambassador to @entity4 , @entity208 , urged the administration to intensify its policy of isolating @entity86			1
" mr. @entity211 has no real allies			0
we must keep it that way , " @entity208 wrote in an op - ed in the @entity215			0
what does @entity86 want next ?			0

industrialized powers acted to penalize @entity4 over @entity13
@entity1 in the @entity78 says the @entity58 and @entity75 allies united in imposing costs on @entity4
@entity4 foreign minister *downplays* effect of losing @entity9 membership
@entity58 will concentrate on diplomatic , economic moves against @entity186
