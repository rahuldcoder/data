-- if you think you 've heard it all , follow this tale of a hungry black bear who went for a ride , literally			2
@entity7 , @entity8 , @entity10 's deputies early friday got a call about a honking car and a commotion inside			1
perhaps it was teenagers or a thief , they thought as they approached @entity18 's 2008 @entity17			1
it turns out it was a thief , albeit the furry variety			0
the deputies ' first clue to something unusual was that the car was 125 feet below its normal parking spot in the driveway of the @entity29 ' @entity28 home , which sits on five acres			1
imagine their further surprise when they turned on their flashlights and got a peek inside			2
it was a full - grown black bear , also known as ursus americanus			2
the deputies had earlier received a call from a neighbor			2
she had heard honking and came up to the @entity42 home , where the family was asleep			0
" our @entity17 was making a heck of a racket and was rocking back and forth , " @entity18 said			1
the neighbor called deputies shortly after 3 a.m. , according to spokeswoman @entity49 of the sheriff 's department in the community 45 miles south of @entity52			1
@entity18 told @entity0 the bear was probably drawn to a peanut butter sandwich left inside by his 17 - year - old son @entity55			1
he said the family did n't realize what was going on until deputies arrived and the neighbor came back and called them			2
by then the car was no longer in the driveway			1
incredulous , story , his wife and three teen children -- who have lived in @entity28 for 17 years -- rushed outside to see the red @entity17 down the hill and near a tree			1
somehow , the bear had either opened the unlocked back door or pushed a window down to get inside			1
understandably agitated , it bumped into the horn repeatedly and eventually knocked the car 's gear into neutral			1
the @entity17 rolled down the hill			1
the door added to the bear 's indignity by closing at some point during the ordeal			1
a sergeant and two deputies who arrived on the scene " were stymied on how to proceed , " @entity18 said			0
they considered a tranquilizer or shooting the bear , whose gender is unknown			0
" public safety is our primary concern , " @entity49 said			0
finally , the officers decided the best outcome for all would be to keep everyone safe and let the bear live to see more adventures			0
after taking pictures , one of them tied a long rope to a door handle and pulled			1
after a few moments , @entity18 said , the bear bounded out around 5 a.m. , at least two hours after it had gotten inside			1
it left a foul - smelling " present " on the front seat			0
the @entity17 was trashed , with its air bags , seats and stereo torn to shreds			2
it 's a total loss			0
@entity110 said he was scared when the family rushed outside to see the car was gone			0
" my dad is going to kill me , " he thought to himself			0
" my car is gone			0
i did n't lock it			0
he said it was stolen			0
" @entity49 said deputies have enough experience not to be shocked during a day 's work			2
but this will make for a great memory			0
@entity18 admitted the incident was pretty comical			0
he 's glad the animal got away and no one was hurt			2
" there 's a bear in the car			1
who are you gon na get mad at ? "			0
