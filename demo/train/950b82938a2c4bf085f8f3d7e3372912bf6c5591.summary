-- someone in the @entity3 @entity2 clearly has a good book to write one day : " how not to do rollouts			0
" with one hapless episode after another , the rollout of the president 's plan to destroy @entity9 is beginning to rival the less - than - splendid debut of the @entity14 website			1
president @entity3 's critics may take some glee from the recent missteps , but they should n't			1
going to war is serious business , especially when the conflict promises to be long and messy			1
for the nation 's sake , our dysfunctional politics needs to become functional on this one or we put too much at risk , starting with the lives of our men and women in uniform			1
that 's why it is imperative and urgent that the @entity3 team and their allies take a deep breath , pull themselves together and get this war effort on solid footing			1
instead of becoming defensive , they need to go on offense , showing the world they are firmly in charge and on a winning path			0
ever since the president went on prime - time television to announce his new strategy to " degrade and destroy " @entity9 , he and his team have slipped on one banana peel after another			1
first came the series of muddled messages			0
was this to be called a war or something else like a counterterrorism campaign ? who knew after so many contradictions from the administration ? is the threat from @entity9 something we are trying to prevent from happening one day or is it imminent ? again , contradictions			1
crucially : still we put boots on the ground or will we leave all the ground fighting to surrogates ? no one can be sure yet			1
even as a coalition grows of nations proclaiming their support , questions also rise of just how much -- or how little -- they will actually do			0
meanwhile , the media has been jammed with news analyses and comments from respected former officials calling into question the whole enterprise			0
the administration expresses confidence that a reconstituted @entity85 military along with @entity87 forces , working with @entity83 air power , can destroy @entity9 in @entity85 , but so far , press reports are skeptical			1
and experts point out that the best @entity85 fighters are @entity92 militia allied with @entity93			0
there is even more skepticism about our capacity to mobilize " moderates " in @entity98			0
and listening to two of @entity3 's former defense chiefs , @entity101 and @entity103 , one suspects they would have strongly opposed the plan if they were still in government			1
as if the gnawing doubts were n't filling enough air time , now comes a new round of stories in the @entity111 , the @entity112 and @entity113 reporting on a growing rift between the president and his military generals			1
one can easily read too much into these tensions			0
in truth , @entity3 and the military have been able to work together in a professional way through most of his administration			1
and certainly the collaboration within the government in pursuit of @entity126 was masterful			0
but it is also true that underneath the surface , there has been an unhealthy atmosphere of mistrust between this @entity2 and some of its military chieftains			0
the @entity3 team has doubted the loyalty of several of its generals , while the military has doubted the competence of the president and his national security team , especially in the second term			1
soon after he took office , @entity3 felt that through leaks to the press , his generals were trying to box him in on how many additional troops he would send to @entity146 , trying to push him to higher numbers			1
he felt excessive pressure as well on keeping a sizable number of troops in @entity85			1
and his political advisers were deeply suspicious that gen. @entity152 would run against @entity3 in 2012 the way gen. @entity154 ran against @entity155 in 1864			0
these fears and anxieties were overwrought , but they have left scars that remain today			0
in both the @entity160 and @entity2 , there is now concern about management of the war from here on out			1
the military worries that @entity3 and his team will micromanage , especially in @entity98 -- something that president @entity168 did with disastrous results in @entity170			2
and they worry that a nervous @entity2 will tie their hands in the fight , ruling out the force necessary to win			2
the @entity2 worries that the military , hellbent upon victory , will accidentally drop bombs on too many innocents , inflaming opinion and making it harder to keep a coalition together			0
they point to what has happened in @entity146 and @entity184			0
in @entity98 , they worry an imprecise approach could further drag the @entity83 into the chaotic civil war			2
presumably , these are adults on both sides who can work things out but if suspicions and rifts grow , that will definitely handicap prosecution of the war -- and risk a national security debacle			2
an additional challenge the administration faces is that the president has now announced @entity83 is going to war , but there are virtually no signs of mobilization on television			1
this is very different from most recent conflicts when a president takes to prime time and within hours screens are filled with pictures of military mobilization or of rockets and bombs flying and the public is rallying round the flag			2
what is left now is a virtual news vacuum that is being largely filled with arguments and counterarguments about the wisdom and competence of the administration			2
all of this is no way to galvanize a nation or build a vibrant coalition			0
in coming days , through his time at the @entity228 and back in the @entity2 , the president must dramatically seize the reins of leadership			2
he must form a strong , bipartisan advisory team around him with leaders from the past such as @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 , and yes , @entity101 and @entity103			0
he has to work in close harness with his military commanders , ending talk of rifts			0
and he must mobilize a coalition of nations that takes the fight to the enemy with great urgency			2
it is inconceivable that the @entity83 , with the best trained and equipped military in the world , ca n't clear the battlefield of a band of thugs			0
we must not lose heart just because this war is off to a rocky start			2
after all and let 's admit it : when the administration finally fixed up @entity14 , it started to work better than many of us expected .			1

@entity262 : rollout of president 's fight *vs.* @entity9 has been *dogged* by *problems*
there 's been uncertainty about whether this is a war and if ground troops may go , he says
this war is too important to have it *shrouded* in *confusion* , @entity262 says
@entity262 : administration can rescue the situation , as it did with @entity14 website
