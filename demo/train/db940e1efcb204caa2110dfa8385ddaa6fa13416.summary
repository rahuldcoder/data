@entity0 , @entity1 -- if you could have painted the day , it would have been a @entity5			1
a white sandy beach , blue sky and a green ocean that you may have only seen in dreams			1
@entity1 's @entity11 , on a sunday			1
the only thing out of place were the @entity15 contractors in green shirts and yellow rubber boots , with shovels , rakes and of course , the oil			1
" i think it 's fantastic that they have a community of people out here trying to clean up , " said @entity22 of @entity23 , @entity24			1
" if i see anything out there that concerns us , we may rethink that , but so far it looks good , " he told @entity2			0
full coverage of oil disaster @entity22 and his family came from @entity23 for the beach , not the tar balls			1
they 're getting a lot of the beach , and fortunately , only a few tar balls			1
just feet from their umbrella , beach cleanup workers were busy scooping up the pea - sized oil fragments that seem to come in and out with the tide on a semi-regular basis , all along @entity1 's @entity49 from @entity50 in the west to @entity52 in the east			1
" we 're going to keep an eye on the weather			0
where the oil is , where it came in from , " said @entity57 commissioner @entity56			2
" and we 're cleaning up			0
we had some oil ... and we picked it up , just like that , " he said			2
most of the oil is in very small amounts of weathered oil			0
it 's small and scattered			0
@entity1 has not seen or felt the pain that comes with the arrival of thick , black crude on the shoreline			1
is there oil on the beach near you ? " it definitely takes a little away from it , but we 're here and we 're going to try and enjoy ourselves , " said @entity77 of @entity78			1
" we did n't feel like trying to arrange something else , and we also felt like we should come down and support this community , too , cause they definitely are feeling the effects of this , " he said			0
those effects are hitting the @entity49 right smack in the wallet			2
tourism is down about 30 to 40 percent , according to state tourism officials			1
more and more cancellations are coming in each day , throughout the state , where 80 million visitors brought in $ 60 billion dollars in 2009			0
@entity1 county to feds : stay out of the way " if you say oil or tar ball to a tourist , they mentally see @entity103 , " said @entity98 of the @entity99 , referring to the thick molasses - like oil that has soaked @entity103 's wetlands			1
that 's why local officials are quick to get the cleanup crews to those limited places where the weathered crude has come ashore			2
" it 's an ongoing fight			1
we 're anticipating continuing to find and fight oil in places it rises to the surface , for the foreseeable future , " said lt. @entity115 of the @entity116			1
" our operations are deployed to support this on a wartime footing , " he told @entity2			0
but on @entity129 , the only thing on people 's minds was enjoying a day on the water , while they still can			2
boaters flock to this sandbar in the @entity133 , to hang out and listen to the floating band			0
and , while they were n't overly distracted by oil , the thought of @entity15 ceo @entity136 on his yacht this past weekend raised the blood pressure of some and was a bit of a head scratcher for others			0
@entity136 goes yachting " he 's probably in some really clean water			2
so , he 's not trying to stop the oil leak , " said one man			2
@entity149 has lived here for 20 years			0
he says his boating business is down 60 to 70 percent , but his anger is a little on the high side			0
" you kind of have to look at that two ways , " he explained			0
he was relaxing and he was out on his boat , and we hate that			0
but on the good side of things , he was n't down here runnin ' his mouth			0
