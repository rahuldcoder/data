@entity0 -- it 's late afternoon on a recent friday when @entity3 walks past the @entity4			1
making her way toward a large picture window , she peers inside the shuttered medical clinic , cupping her hand on the glass to block the glaring sun. backing away , she gasps at a series of petite baby hands made of plaster fastened to the windowsill			0
" that is sad , " she said			0
" but i guess it 's the memory of the little kids that never made it			0
" @entity3 said she was a patient of @entity21 , a @entity0 physician who was accused of killing babies born after attempted abortions in the sixth , seventh , and eighth months of their mothers ' pregnancies at his @entity28 clinic , while operating in dangerous , deplorable conditions			1
@entity21 carried out those killings in a particularly brutal manner : using scissors to cut the babies ' spinal cords			1
he also was charged in the death of a 41 - year - old woman during an abortion procedure			1
he was found guilty monday of three counts of first - degree murder for the deaths of the babies , and involuntary manslaughter for the woman 's death			1
the grisly allegations in the case -- dirty procedure rooms , blood - stained and weathered equipment , babies born alive , breathing and crying , and unlicensed staff administering anesthesia -- shocked the nation and prompted @entity3 to rethink what she went through six years ago			1
@entity21 horror fuels fight for abortion laws the 36 - year - old now wonders if maybe her child was born alive and had its neck snipped			1
" i try not to think about it			0
but i think about it , and it 's sad			0
i wish i never did it , " she said			0
" if i would have known what i know now , i never would have had an abortion			2
" @entity3 , now a mother , said she was approximately six months pregnant at the time @entity21 performed her abortion , which was not part of the criminal case against him			1
@entity1 could not independently verify @entity3 's account			2
it 's illegal to perform an abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy in the state of @entity28			0
generally , most doctors will not perform abortions after 20 weeks , @entity0 district attorney @entity76 said following @entity21 's arrest in january 2011			2
prosecutors say @entity21 , who is not certified to perform abortions , falsified gestational ages on records			1
" this doctor gained the reputation far and wide that he 'd perform abortions at any time , " @entity76 said			0
struggling with the idea of having a child , @entity3 ultimately decided to terminate her pregnancy			2
so one evening , her father escorted her to @entity21 's crowded and unkempt clinic in @entity0 for the procedure			2
opinion : @entity21 case shows why abortion rights need protection " he seemed like he was a helpful person , " she said of @entity21 , adding that her abortion cost $ 1,600			1
" i did n't have ( all ) the money up front			0
so i was able to give him partial money and come back and pay the rest off in payment plans			0
" although unaware of the salacious allegations that later surfaced during the investigation of the clinic , @entity3 said she felt " uncomfortable " and " scared " at the doctor 's office			2
" all the equipment was old , it was rusty			0
it looked like stuff from back in the 70s			0
and it was dirty , " she said			0
" but i had to , you know , at the time , i had to do what i had to do			0
" during the trial , prosecutors accused @entity21 of reusing unsanitary instruments ; performing procedures in filthy rooms , including some having litter boxes and animals present during operations ; and allowing unlicensed employees -- including a teenage high school student -- to perform operations and administer anesthesia			1
@entity21 's defense attorney @entity133 maintained that none of the infants was killed ; rather , he said , they were already deceased as a result of @entity21 previously administering the drug @entity137 , which can cause abortion			1
the conviction on three counts of first - degree murder mean @entity21 , who is not a board - certified obstetrician or gynecologist , could be sentenced to death			1
" he deserves to die , " @entity3 said .			2

@entity3 says @entity21 performed an abortion on her years ago
after details of his trial *emerged* , she had second thoughts about her decision
prosecutors said @entity21 killed babies by cutting their spinal cords with scissors
he was found guilty of first - degree murder on monday
