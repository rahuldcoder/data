-- @entity1 hits golf balls			1
she hits them hard and far , with astonishing accuracy			0
she won the women 's @entity5 competition in 2008 when she hit a ball more than 250 yards			1
@entity1 is so good , in fact , that the @entity5 changed the rules this year to prevent her from competing			1
the @entity10 has a rule to specifically exclude her , as well			1
in august 2009 , 18 - year - old runner @entity12 from @entity13 won the gold medal in the 800 - meter event of the @entity16 , beating her nearest rival by an astonishing two seconds			2
afterward , she faced weeks of humiliating psychological , gynecological and physical testing to prove that she was female ordered by @entity19			0
she eventually was allowed to keep her medal			0
in 1936 , @entity21 won four track gold medals at the @entity23 in @entity24			1
he faced @entity26 taunts that his @entity28 heritage somehow provided an innate athletic advantage and that blacks should be banned from competing in future games			2
and when baseball player @entity33 shattered the racial barrier in professional sports , an act that we now celebrate for its courage , some players refused to share a locker room with him			1
prejudice , discrimination and unfounded charges of advantage or somehow cheating are nothing new to sports			1
it raised its ugly head again in @entity1 's case			1
she had sex - reassignment surgery in 2005			0
in every way that our society legally , socially or physically defines gender , she is female			0
she sued the @entity10 and others , claiming a requirement in their bylaws requiring that participants be " female - born " is discriminatory			1
make no mistake -- it is			0
we 've been down this path before			0
in 1976 , transsexual tennis player @entity61 was banned from competing in the @entity62 because of a similar " women - born - women " rule			1
the @entity65 struck down the rule , and @entity61 competed professionally from 1977 to 1981			1
despite concerns of that allowing her to compete against women gave her an inherent advantage , her highest overall ranking was 20th in 1979			2
thirty - five years later , you 'd think that we would be past this , but here we are			2
different sport , same unfounded fears , same dehumanizing situation			0
@entity78 , too , am a transsexual athlete			2
although the last time i competed on a mat was more than 30 years ago , i trained to compete against some of the elite women athletes in this country at the @entity62 @entity85 in april			1
i finished sixth in my weight class			0
some charge that we compete because of some inherent competitive advantage			0
such charges are as ignorant as they are absurd			0
we compete for the same reasons that others do : because we love our sport , because we are athletes and because we want to continue doing something we enjoy			2
competition is a fundamental right that we refuse to relinquish simply because our path to manhood or womanhood was nontraditional			0
click to read more opinions the rest of the world is far ahead of the @entity103 in this regard			1
in 2003 , the @entity105 became the first international sports organization to develop a policy of inclusion for transgender athletes			1
recognition that a person 's gender is more complicated than any single factor , combined with the inability to identify medically sound testing criteria , led to discontinuation of mandatory sex testing on female athletes 1999			2
( tests may be done on a case - by - case basis , however			0
) according to @entity105 guidelines , transsexual athletes must have undergone hormone replacement therapy for at least two years , be legally recognized as the sex in which they want to compete and have had " sex reassignment " surgery in order to compete in their authentic gender			2
many international sports organizations , including the governing body for wrestling , have adopted or defer to the @entity105 policies			0
as transgender people continue to integrate into all aspects of broader society , the practices that have historically been accepted as " just the way it is " will be identified as discrimination			0
so , too , will the daily indignities that so many of us face regarding bathrooms , jobs , housing , harassment and having to prove our manhood or womanhood be identified as unacceptable , illegal and inherently unfair			0
@entity1 's experience with the @entity10 demonstrates that the combination of transgender people and athletics continues to be a volatile mixture that can easily devolve into an irrational , emotional argument rather than one based on fact or measurement			1
regardless , it 's only a matter of time before a transsexual athlete becomes the first to represent his or her country at the @entity23			1
that day will be one to celebrate as another part of a long tradition of overcoming barriers to competition			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			2
