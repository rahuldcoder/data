-- the @entity1 are coming ! the @entity1 are coming ! well , ok , maybe not			1
but if a couple of vessels flying the colors of the @entity5 do appear off @entity7 shores sometime soon , do n't panic			2
even if it happens -- something @entity7 officials have called into question -- the point of any such voyage appears to be to make a public - relations splash			0
" what this does is , to people who do n't know anything about sea power , which is a fairly substantial number of people in the developing world , it looks like a major gesture , " @entity7 military analyst @entity14 told @entity0			1
" within @entity1 's sort of politics , it follows a long theme of @entity28 and other statements that @entity1 can defeat the @entity7			1
" but @entity14 , who holds the @entity30 at the @entity31 , said the reported @entity1 flotilla -- led by an aging frigate the @entity34 once nearly sunk -- poses no risk to the world 's biggest naval power			0
" deploying a military museum is not going to threaten to the @entity7 , " he said			1
the semi-official @entity1 news agency @entity39 quoted the head of @entity1 's navy over the weekend as saying an @entity1 flotilla " is approaching the @entity7 ' maritime borders " as a response to the @entity7 decision to beef up its naval presence in the @entity47			1
adm. @entity48 said the @entity1 ships were nearing the southern tip of @entity51 en route to the @entity53			1
a @entity7 military official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said there was no information to support the claim , and there was no other corroboration of the report from @entity63			2
@entity1 announced plans to send ships toward the @entity7 maritime borders twice in 2011 ; neither deployment materialized			1
but @entity1 's @entity68 reported in january that the frigate @entity70 and the supply ship @entity72 , which also carries helicopters , were headed to the @entity53 " to provide the safety of @entity1 's shipping lines in international waters and to provide training for the new recruits			2
" the 300 - foot @entity70 went into service in 1972			0
it was heavily damaged in a skirmish with @entity7 forces in 1988 , when @entity7 warships were dispatched to protect international oil tankers during @entity1 's war with @entity86			1
the announcement comes as @entity1 prepares to mark the 35th anniversary of the revolution that toppled @entity90			2
the @entity91 sounded unfazed by the @entity39 report			2
freedom of seas applies to all , so long as they understand responsibilities of that freedom , " rear adm. @entity93 , the @entity91 's press secretary , posted on @entity94			0
most of @entity1 's navy is made up of small attack craft , about two dozen of which are armed with missiles , according to the authoritative @entity105			0
its biggest warships are the @entity70 and its four sister frigates , along with two smaller and lighter corvettes and 14 diesel - electric submarines			0
@entity63 previously dispatched ships to patrol the @entity47 of @entity112 and @entity113 for @entity115 pirates , capturing 13 during a 2012 engagement			0
it also dispatched warships to the @entity119 via the @entity120 in 2011 and 2012 -- moves billed as carrying messages of " peace and friendship " to the region , but which also tweaked the nose of regional foe @entity127			0
but the navy 's main mission is to defend its home waters in the @entity47 and control the @entity132			0
while it has the potential to attack its rivals in a hit - and - run fashion , " that 's not the kind of force you can deploy outside the @entity47 , " @entity14 said			0
" @entity1 can sort of make demonstrative gestures and sail in international waters off the @entity7 @entity143 , or @entity144 for that matter , " @entity14 said			1
" but it 's not much more threatening than if somebody showed up in a rowboat			0
" @entity1 touts launch of new missiles ; @entity7 says it 's watching closely @entity0 's @entity151 contributed to this report .			1

" deploying a military museum is not going to threaten to the @entity7 , " analyst says
@entity1 announced last week that it would send ships to waters off the @entity7
the @entity91 sounds unfazed by the announcement
