" i call on the @entity2 - @entity6 community not to send their youth to @entity2 to fight alongside @entity15 , " president sheik @entity12 said on sunday			1
he was referring to the @entity17 militant group that is waging a brutal war against his administration in @entity20			2
" i am saying to those young men from abroad : ' your families fled your home to @entity6 because of insecurity			2
you should not return here to ferment violence against your people , ' " he said			0
@entity2 began arriving in the @entity6 in significant numbers after the @entity6 intervention in @entity2 's humanitarian crisis in 1992			1
a sizable group of young @entity2 - @entity6 men left @entity35 last year and were feared recruited by @entity15 militants			1
in october , @entity37 , 27 , a @entity38 who had been radicalized by @entity15 in his adopted home state of @entity41 , traveled to @entity2 and blew up himself and 29 others			2
the incident -- the first - ever suicide bombing by a naturalized @entity6 citizen -- raised red flags throughout the @entity6 intelligence community			2
the president 's call came after fresh fighting erupted sunday between @entity2 's transitional government forces and @entity17 rebels			1
according to several witness accounts , @entity53 -- the @entity53 -- supported government forces to push back @entity15 as the militia attacked the presidential palace			0
@entity53 tanks and soldiers were involved in the fighting , according to witnesses			0
" the sound of heavy artillery in @entity20 was very loud and continuous , " a witness told @entity0			0
" it was shaking the ground , and many buildings were destroyed by the shelling			0
" the president called the operation " a clear victory " against @entity15			0
" our forces have weakened the strength of the @entity15 militia in this fighting , " @entity12 said			2
government forces displayed the bodies of five @entity15 fighters in their trademark green uniforms			0
@entity15 , a group that is on the @entity6 government 's terror watch list , remains entrenched in the northeast and sections of the south of the capital			1
the group categorized the involvement of @entity53 as a shift in their attempts to overthrow the transitional government			1
" the fighting in @entity20 has entered a new phase			0
now it 's between us and @entity53 , " said @entity95 , a spokesman for @entity15			0
" @entity53 was backing up the government directly , but we will keep fighting			0
" @entity2 has been mired in chaos since 1991 , when warlords overthrew dictator @entity102 and sparked brutal clan infighting			0
the transitional government has struggled to establish authority , challenged by @entity17 groups that have seized control of @entity20 and much of the south			1

the potential recruitment of young @entity2 - @entity6 men has been made possible by " a number of factors that come together when a dynamic , influential and extremist leader gains access to a despondent and disenfranchised group of young men , " @entity123 , deputy director for intelligence at the @entity125 , said earlier this year			1
many refugees , he said , " lack structure and definition in their lives " and are " torn between their parents ' traditional tribal and clan identities , and the new cultures and traditions offered by @entity6 society			0
