-- before luxury yachting was the preserve of @entity4 tycoons and @entity6 moguls , it was only the world 's wealthiest royals who built palaces on the sea			1
there have been and continue to be a fleet of imperial yachts used to transport royals , from @entity4 czars to princes of @entity17 , in the opulent fashion to which they are accustomed			1
" @entity19 " there are probably few finer examples of a regal leisure boat than " @entity24 's @entity23 , " built in 1953 for @entity25 's @entity24 now decommissioned and on display in @entity27 , @entity28 , the vast and lavishly designed " @entity32 " has sailed over one million miles during 44 years of service and in the course of 968 official royal visits			1
once described by @entity24 as " the one place where i can truly relax , " the royal yacht , built to many of the queen 's specifications , boasts huge dining rooms adorned with gifts and curiosities from around the world , including a whale rib found by her husband on a beach			1
in addition , there 's a sun lounge with furniture chosen by the queen and a garage built to house the royal @entity52			1
sir @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 are among the famous names who have joined the queen on board over the years , but " @entity32 " was also deployed for more private and romantic occasions			0
as @entity63 and @entity64 add the finishing touches to their wedding plans , they may well feel a pang of regret that " @entity19 " is no longer in service			1
four royal honeymoons took place on board , including @entity73 and princess @entity75 's 16 - day trip in the @entity76			1
" @entity77 " today , the undisputed champion of royal vessels belongs to @entity77 's @entity80 , whose $ 300 million mega-yacht is christened -- somewhat unimaginatively -- " @entity77			1
" measuring 524 feet long , it 's the world 's second - largest yacht , eclipsed only by @entity4 billionaire @entity85 's suitably named " @entity84			1
" three elevators and one vast open glass stairway serve its multitude of decks which , aside from the gold - finished , jewel - encrusted vip guestrooms and appropriately palatial master bedrooms , contain a squash room , spa , banquet hall and cinema			0
and did we mention the helicopter pad up top ? in keeping with the fantasy - flavored extravagance of " @entity77 , " the yacht is moored year - round on the artificial " @entity102 , " situated next to the country 's emblematic , man - made archipelago " @entity105 " -- built from one billion cubic meters of rock and sand			1
" @entity108 " if you thought that @entity85 and his fellow billionaires were the first of their countrymen to build ultra-ostentatious pleasure boats , then think again			0
the @entity4 imperial yacht " @entity108 , " built according to the specifications of emperor @entity116 and his son @entity117 , was the largest imperial yacht on the oceans during the late 19th and early 20th century			0
completed in 1895 , the opulent vessel was 401 feet long -- about the length of a soccer pitch -- colossal even by today 's immodest standards			2
indeed , " @entity108 " was a veritable floating palace , adorned with mahogany - paneled drawing rooms , formal salons with polished floors , brass fittings , crystal chandeliers and velvet drapes			0
the czar 's private study was furnished in dark leather and elegant wooden furniture , while the czarina 's drawing room and boudoir were bedecked in her favorite @entity138 chintz			2
the imperial yacht even had its own chapel for the private use of the family			0
however , @entity4 's largest royal yacht was also her last			2
after the revolution in 1917 , the ship was stripped of all its elegance , renamed " @entity148 " and refitted as a drab , gray minelayer for service in the @entity151			0
the boat was scrapped at @entity153 in @entity154 in 1963			0
" @entity155 " decked out with a @entity156 , sea kayaks , snorkeling gear and wetsuits , " @entity155 " is one of the few specially tailored yachts fit to chart the delicate waters surrounding the @entity162			2
the boat 's regal past is only hinted at in its name			0
" @entity155 , " as the vessel is now known , was once the royal yacht of @entity167 and princess @entity168			0
when @entity172 actress @entity171 married the prince of @entity17 , the couple were extensively pictured honeymooning on this exquisite 147 - foot - long yacht , given to them as a wedding gift by prominent @entity179 shipping merchant @entity177			2
the boat was captured on boundless newsreels as cameras and reporters followed @entity171 on her last voyage from the @entity172 to her new home in what was then styled " the wedding of the century			0
" the couple left the day after the ceremony to cruise the coasts of @entity191 and @entity192			0
" @entity193 " the @entity193 is one of the last active royal yachts in @entity196 , belonging to @entity197 , @entity198			2
built in 1937 by @entity200 , the oldest leisure marine company in the world , the boat was originally owned by @entity25 aviation pioneer sir @entity203 -- who had given it over to the @entity25 's @entity206 to serve as a convoy escort vessel during @entity208 in july 1947 , the ship was purchased by the people of @entity211 as a present to the much beloved @entity213 for his 75th birthday			1
the royal yacht was renamed " norge , " the @entity211 word for @entity211			1
still used today for state visits abroad , the classically shaped yacht is also employed as a base for the king when he competes in international yacht races .			0
