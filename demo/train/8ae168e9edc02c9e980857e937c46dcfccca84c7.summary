-- memo to @entity2 and the " today " show from the @entity4 : do some research before you talk about me ! during the fourth hour of @entity11 's morning show on monday , co-hosts @entity8 and @entity2 were talking with @entity12 correspondent @entity13 about @entity4 wanting to be a judge on " @entity15 , " a story which @entity0 first reported			1
@entity17 emphatically said today 's generation of music lovers do n't know who the 18 - time @entity21 winner is			2
" if they are looking for a younger demographic , there are a lot of kids out there ( who ) actually do n't know who @entity4 is			1
it 's sad , but they do n't , " @entity17 said			2
then , @entity13 poured more cold water on the idea of @entity35 doing the show , saying she does n't like to fly and that will make it hard for her to travel across the country for auditions			1
" she does not fly			2
she needs to get over that ( doing ' @entity15 ' ) , " he said			2
a few hours later , @entity35 responded in an e-mail , exclusively obtained by @entity0			1
in it , she set the record -- and her critics at " today " -- straight			0
" while i enjoy @entity2 and @entity8 daily , her assessment is totally wrong ! " @entity35 wrote			1
" i 've been to @entity51 from @entity52 four times this year and @entity54			0
i go wherever i choose to go comfortably on my custom bus			0
" further , my audience and fans span the age of 8 to 90 ! and are multi-ethnic , and i am very well known to young adults , tweens and teens			0
their parents play my music and i take care of my business whenever i sign on the dotted line ! " i 'm surprised @entity2 did not research my worldwide celebrity audience ! she 's usually right on top of things with a great sense of humor , but she 's totally wrong this time			1
she should research me before she speaks about me			0
i 'm sure she thought she was right ; still enjoy @entity8 and @entity2 ! " as for be a judge on " @entity15 , " @entity35 made it clear she 's up for the task			1
" i could enjoy being a judge for a season or two			0
let 's kick it up a few notches and have a slammin ' , jammin ' season , " she wrote			0
@entity81 on depature of @entity83 , @entity84			0

@entity4 told @entity0 she *'d* like to be a judge on " @entity15 "
@entity2 **wonders** whether younger *people* know @entity4
@entity13 of @entity12 **wonders** whether she could go to auditions since she does n't fly
@entity35 *retorts* in e-mail sent to @entity0 : " assessment is totally wrong ! "
