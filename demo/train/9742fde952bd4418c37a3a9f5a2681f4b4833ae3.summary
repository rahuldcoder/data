-- it all started with ice cream			0
" i saw a long line of people waiting for a free scoop at the @entity11 next to my store , " said @entity3 , owner and operator of @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7			1
" knowing that comics are even cooler than ice cream , i was convinced that publishers , retailers and our major distributor , @entity19 , could all band together to do something powerful to attract people of all ages and interests to check out their local comics shops			1
" thus , @entity25 was born			1
it was during a tough time for the comic book industry			2
the first one came in 2002 , the same year " @entity30 " became a blockbuster in theaters			2
just six years earlier , however , @entity33 filed for bankruptcy , and comic books had been struggling ever since			2
the idea of @entity25 is simple : publishers put out one or two comic books each year for free on the first saturday in may for the 300,000 to 500,000 customers who show up at local comic book stores			1
saturday 's event will be the 10th			1
store owners like @entity43 , of @entity45 's @entity44 , see it as a big success			1
" it 's the biggest sales day of the year for us , and many people discover us for the first time , " he said			2
many store owners make the day into an all - out event			1
@entity43 plans to have an ' 80s cover band , a replica of the 1960s @entity60 and actors from @entity64 's zombie - themed tv show " @entity62 , " among other things , at his two stores			0
at @entity68 in @entity69 , customers will be able to meet popular writer and @entity72 chief creative officer @entity71			0
" i consider it to be like a national holiday celebrating comic books , where the industry metaphorically opens their doors to the public , " said @entity73 , editor of @entity74			1
" gaining new -- and especially younger -- readers is absolutely crucial to the health of the comic book industry , now more than ever before			1
" comic book publishers usually offer titles with storylines that can be easily followed and , in many cases , issues aimed at younger readers			1
" we try to make them as new - reader - friendly as possible , " said @entity92 , editor - in - chief at @entity33			0
" we usually do n't push the envelope in terms of content			0
" " our hope is that the comic books that fans pick up on @entity25 , for a lot of them , might be their first one , " @entity72 co-publisher @entity96 said , explaining how it chooses which issues to offer			1
" we want to take a character that 's well - known and accessible to the readership and at the same time , tie in to some of the future plans we have for publishing			2
" " when i was growing up , there were comics in the barber shop			2
not any more , " said @entity115 of the @entity117 podcast			0
" today , comics are mostly in specialty comics shops			2
they are not anyplace that a kid is likely to see them by happenstance , so having an event that will draw people to the ' few and far between ' locations that offer comics is crucial to getting this key demographic interested in comics			2
" according to trend - watching magazine @entity132 , the industry is starting to see growth			0
" @entity132 has tracked industry sales since 2005 , when @entity138 comic and graphic novel sales were $ 565 million , " publisher @entity134 said			2
" in 2009 , industry sales were $ 680 million			0
" " we anticipated that this year 's event would be the biggest ever based on the best selection ever of free comics based on well - known properties , and based on the record orders for comics to be give away , it will be , " he added			1
so why is " @entity25 " so highly anticipated this year ? here 's what some of the major publishers have on tap for saturday 's big event : @entity33 @entity33 's superheroes have had movies in theaters over the weekend of " @entity25 " for several years now			1
this year , it 's " @entity159 , " and this year 's free comic is an all - ages story starring @entity159 and @entity160 ( who has his own movie in july ) , entitled " @entity160 / @entity159 : the @entity163			1
" @entity92 compares it to " a @entity166 movie that 's accessible for adults and children			0
it 's meant to be a jumping - on point into comics , essentially			2
" the " @entity173 " story arc is going to be big for the company this year , and so many fans , as well as new readers , will probably seek out the free " @entity178 " comic , by @entity179 and @entity180 , that ties into it			1
" it 's two of our top talents on a full - length story , " @entity92 said			0
@entity72 not to be outdone , one of @entity72 's characters is headed to the big screen for the first time next month , and " @entity192 " will be a hot issue this year			1
it also includes a preview of the big crossover " flashpoint			2
" " we 've seen some orders that have been better in the past than @entity25 , " co-publisher @entity197 said			1
" the preview of ' flashpoint ' is exciting a lot of our retailers			0
" @entity72 will also offer a " @entity206 / @entity205 : @entity212 " issue aimed at young readers , based on the two animated series on @entity210 ( both @entity210 and @entity72 are owned by @entity211 , which also owns @entity0 )			0
@entity213 the company best known for " @entity215 , " as well as the adaptations of " @entity217 " and " @entity218 , " will also be aiming for readers of all ages with an issue that features " avatar : the last airbender " and " @entity217 : the @entity223			0
" " we have an expanded library of ' @entity217 : @entity228 ' comics but are just beginning our last airbender program , " editor @entity226 said			0
" i think we 're constantly trying to find material that will appeal to younger readers			1
when you discover something you love at a young age , chances are you 'll stick by it through adulthood , and the material will age with you			0
" like many of the other companies , it also has something for older readers in two horror comics , " @entity246 " from " @entity215 " creator @entity247 and " @entity248			1
" image comics " @entity62 " has been a runaway hit for this company in recent years , but its " @entity25 " offering is decidedly tamer in the " @entity254 , " written by " @entity62 " creator @entity255			1
" @entity254 " made its debut in stores last month , and the company hopes @entity255 will hit another home run , this time with a broader audience			0
" whether you 're talking comics or movies or music or television -- any form of entertainment -- a graying fan base is going to be your undoing just through attrition , " publisher @entity260 said			0
" you have to continually find ways to appeal to a younger audience , and i think what @entity3 has come up with @entity25 is a great way of doing that			1
" @entity276 it made its name with licensed properties like " @entity280 , " transformers , " " @entity282 " and " @entity284 , " and this year , @entity276 is offering up an original issue of its cult hit " @entity283			0
" " it was recently nominated for four @entity289 awards , " ceo and publisher @entity291 said			0
" @entity292 just shot a pilot for it , and hopefully it will be on air this fall			0
" " @entity283 " is usually intended for mature audiences , but this issue is different : " we purposefully chose a story that was all ages			0
it 's an action - based story , so it 's ok for kids , but the actual book is intended for adults			0
" no matter their ages , @entity291 , like others in the industry , hopes readers will enjoy saturday 's festivities at their nearby comic book store : " it 's sort of like @entity313 and @entity314 and @entity315 rolled into one			1
