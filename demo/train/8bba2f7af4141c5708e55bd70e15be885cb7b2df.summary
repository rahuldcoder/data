-- it 's a truth of the modern digital age : if you 're using a web service for free , you 're not the customer			1
you 're probably the product			0
the sites we visit , the videos we watch , the purchases we make and the items we reward with a @entity13 " like " or a @entity14 " +1 " -- all of that , and more , eventually melds together into a data set that lets many of the world 's most popular web companies get to know us better			1
and they 're using it to make billions of dollars			1
but what if @entity23 users could reclaim their online data and benefit , or maybe even profit , from it ? that 's what a group of new startups want to happen			1
they say that instead of giving away data to tech titans who turn around and use it to target advertising , users should get something in return			1
" i think what 's happening now is that , finally , people are becoming aware of how their data 's being used , " said @entity39 , ceo of a company called @entity41			1
" and in the future , they 're not going to be just giving this stuff up			0
" with @entity41 , users can import data from sites like @entity13 and @entity51 and info like their web - browsing histories and purchases to a secure " data vault			1
" from there , they can pretty much add anything they want , from computer passwords to medical information to emergency contacts for the babysitter			0
one feature even allows people to enter @entity66 information like @entity68 numbers , promising that they 'll never have to spend time filling out an online form again			0
from there , they choose who to share with , be it the aforementioned babysitter or co-workers or family members			0
but @entity39 sees a future in which they could choose to share it more publicly , in exchange for cash or other benefits			1
so , for example , if someone had been searching websites to buy a particular make and model of car , they could choose to make that publicly known			0
car dealers using the site could then theoretically send targeted deals or offers			2
" we 'd love to see it sort of filtered ... where you 're commanding the best deals , the best discounts -- and even direct compensation -- for the chance to meet me this way , " he said			0
but is that just a way to invite digital junk mail ? " that could n't be further from the vision we have , " @entity39 said			0
" the model that 's going to emerge is one where people , in a much safer and more controlled environment , let some of their data filter out and decide what kind of people will be able to even reach them at all			2
and when they do , they wo n't know their identity			0
" the problem , at least so far , is that @entity23 players like @entity14 and @entity13 are already getting a lot of that data for free			1
" the killer app is n't here yet , " @entity122 , who is working on a data study for the @entity124 , told the @entity125			2
but he says that might soon change			0
" i 'm willing to bet that within the next 12 months , something big will catch on , " he said			0
@entity132 's company , @entity131 , does n't aim to one day earn users a direct payout			1
in fact , he says , it does n't even need to combat the @entity23 's current data - scraping model			2
" the price of using free web services should n't be our privacy			2
but until there are market solutions , i do n't see that trend changing , " he said			0
" what we 're doing is more about actually making the data you create useful			2
" like @entity41 , @entity131 lets users compile all their data in one place via a sort of data locker			1
( @entity154 is its ongoing open - source effort to let developers change and improve it			2
) they cite some of the same convenience benefits of doing so that @entity41 does			1
( both projects , it should be noted , are in their early phases			0
) but what @entity162 has set out to do is let developers create hyper - personalized apps that would use that information			1
" we 're trying to create a new push for creativity , a new push for experiences , " he said			0
" we 're starting to see the power of personal apps , but there are not nearly enough of them			1
" we want to make sure the creator has less of an engineering challenge to making your data awesome			2
" @entity39 started @entity41 in 2009			1
at the time , he said , friends in the tech industry told him that it was folly , that he 'd never convince many people to care about how their data is used online			2
fast - forward three years , and just a week 's worth of headlines tell a different story			0
members of @entity190 and dozens of state attorneys have publicly questioned @entity14 's new privacy policy , which will pull data from its many products into one user profile			1
president @entity196 unveiled an online bill of rights aimed at protecting users ' privacy on the @entity23 and says legislation could be next			2
and on @entity13 , which has been no stranger to data - sharing controversy , some users are bracing for a change to the timeline feature that they fear will make their past activity too easy for others to find			1
" i think that it 's a perfect moment now , " @entity39 said			0
" i think there 's a whole perfect storm happening for companies like ours			0
" for older web users , he said , the fear was always that someone was tracking them online and could do something harmful with the information			1
now , more often than not , users resent the fact that billions of dollars are being made on information they 're giving away for free			1
" it 's not even about the money any more , " he said			0
" it 's about the principle			0
i think that 's the emotional vein that people are tapped into right now			0

new companies seek to help web users take better control of their personal data
one company , @entity41 , says users could one day trade data for perks , cash
@entity131 offers data lockers that developers will use for personalized apps
@entity14 , @entity13 and others have made billions by harnessing user data
