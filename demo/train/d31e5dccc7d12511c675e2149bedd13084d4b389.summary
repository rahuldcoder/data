-- sports loom large in the public 's mind today			0
from the @entity6 and @entity7 scandals to the upcoming @entity8 and the @entity10 playoffs , much attention is being paid to our athletes and coaches			0
these men have enormous impact on the lives of our children , which makes the focus on actions at @entity6 and @entity7 universities necessary and the mockery of the actions of honorable men , such as @entity25 quarterback @entity24 , so disheartening			1
@entity24 continues to win games			1
this sunday he again led the @entity25 to victory			1
he 's now 6 - 1 this year as a starter , the @entity25 are in first place in their division , and he has led the team to the most road wins in a row since @entity34			1
@entity24 is a good man and a good football player			1
he 's a man of character , faith and integrity			2
he 's also a @entity39 winner , a two - time @entity8 national champion and arguably one of the greatest college football players of all time			0
@entity24 is a role model for sports fans everywhere			1
but instead of lifting him up , too many commentators , critics and even fellow athletes mock and deride him and hope that he fails			0
the latest example is " @entity49 , " where one kneels in prayer with his or her head bent in mockery of @entity24 's usual touchdown celebration prayer			1
several weeks ago , @entity56 ' linebacker @entity55 " @entity55 " after sacking @entity24 and @entity56 tight end @entity57 " tebowed " after catching a touchdown against the @entity25			1
critics like to pretend that it 's @entity24 's football style that bothers them			2
@entity24 has n't yet proven to be a natural pocket passer , but in his last start he threw for more than 200 yards with two touchdowns , no interceptions and a passer rating near 150 , and he continues to lead game - winning drives almost every week			1
there is always room for healthy criticism in sports , especially at the quarterback position , but @entity24 is subject to something uglier			1
sportscasters love to take extra shots at @entity24 ; take @entity77 , who at one point tweeted , " it 's embarrassing to think the @entity25 could win with @entity24 ! ! " critics have a problem with who @entity24 is as a man			1
they are bothered by his faith , character and conviction			0
@entity87 , former @entity25 quarterback , said in a recent interview , " i wish he 'd just shut up			1
" they tell him to take his " holier than thou " faith off the field			2
too many in our culture deride good men such as @entity24 because they make them feel uncomfortable			2
these same critics believe the @entity100 ! theory of human behavior			0
this theory assumes that the real character of a person is always base and hidden from the eye and that all good actions are a front for ulterior and bad or low motives			0
aha ! @entity24 , you say you 're @entity111 , but we know it 's a facade for sympathy and attention			2
you 're just like the rest of us			0
@entity118 warned us of this			0
he wrote in " @entity120 , " " we make men without chests and expect from them virtue and enterprise			0
we laugh at honor and are shocked to find traitors in our midst			0
" we scoff at @entity24 and all that he represents and are horrified at the scandals at @entity6 and @entity7			1
we are right to be horrified , but we should n't make fun of our good men			0
men such as @entity24 are not in over supply			2
despite what his critics say , he should not stop what he is doing			0
we need men like him , the type of men many fathers would want their daughters to marry and many mothers would want their sons to grow up to be			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity144 .			2

@entity24 is proving to be a winning quarterback for the @entity25
@entity144 says @entity24 *displays* his faith on the field , and gets criticism
he says some scoff at @entity24 or mock him
@entity144 : @entity24 is the kind of role model fans should value
