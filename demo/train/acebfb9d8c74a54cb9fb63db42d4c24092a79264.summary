editor 's note : @entity2 is chief executive of @entity3 , a global management consulting firm , and the author of " @entity6 : a short guide to leading a @entity8 "			1
he writes a weekly column , how we work , for @entity12			2
@entity2 says recession is an opportunity to reorient the focus of your working life to what you love to do			1
@entity19 ( @entity20 ) -- a friend of mine , a senior leader in a pharmaceutical company , spends all her spare time doing yoga , taking classes in comparative religions , reading about spirituality , speaking with others about their beliefs			1
just talking about it energizes her			2
which is not how she feels about her day job			1
" why do n't you leave your job and do something with this full time ? " i asked her			1
" i 've thought about it			2
but i could never make the kind of money i make now			1
" she might be right			2
but the question is n't whether she could make as much money			1
even if she stays in her job she 's unlikely to do that in this economy			1
the question is far broader and more interesting			2
what would her life look like -- in every dimension she values -- if she decided to pursue her passion full time ? she needs to consider the contribution she 'd make			1
the relationships she 'd foster			2
the fun she 'd have			2
the feelings she 'd carry with her throughout the day			0
her engagement in her work			0
in short , what her life would mean			0
and , of course , also the money			1
which , as it turns out , might actually be greater if she were more engaged in her work			0
@entity64 has collected data on 5.4 million employees in over 137 countries and concluded that engaged employees are more productive and customer - focused			0
which could mean more money for her			1
but why are we even having this conversation during the worst downturn this country has seen in the last 70 years ? is n't she lucky simply to have a job ? yes			1
and , because of that , she 's also stuck			0
for better and worse , she probably wo n't leave			0
but maybe you 're not so lucky -- you 've been laid off or might be soon ; you 're a student coming into the job market ; or like several people i know , you 've been thinking about a change			1
well , this is your opportunity			1
you did n't want to risk a change when things were going well			0
there was too much to lose			0
but this downturn , this economic mess we 're in , could be your chance			0
when everything was going well , we spent money we did n't have thinking we would make more tomorrow			1
it 's easy to point a finger at @entity96 ( and he deserves the finger ) , but the truth is , it 's not just him			0
we 're all victims of our own little ponzi schemes			0
the life we 've been living , the debt we 've been incurring , is unsustainable			0
maybe the layoff is a favor			0
you were treated as expendable			0
but were you , working those long hours to keep a job you did n't love , treating your self as expendable too ? depressing ? sure			1
but now that we know , we can do something about it			0
i do n't want to be cavalier ; i know food on the table is a necessity			0
we still need work and money			1
here are our new rules for finding it : rule # 1 : do n't spend too much time looking for your next job			1
as i discuss in my article for @entity125 , " need to find a job ? @entity127 , " searching for a job more than 1 - 2 hours a day will actually make it less likely you 'll find one			1
rule # 2 : focus your time on what you 're truly passionate about			1
expand your comfort zone with new activities , new people			1
studies show that 80 percent of jobs are found through networking			0
which is what you 're doing when you pursue your passion with other people			1
so do it without guilt			0
spend your newfound spare time doing what you enjoy with people whom you enjoy			1
rule # 3 : let those people know you want to make your money doing these things			1
do n't hammer it in			0
successful people are passionate , obsessed			2
and obsession is n't motivated by money			2
it 's deeper than that			0
employers want to hire someone who is naturally driven			0
you 'll work at your obsession all the time because you want to			2
and that kind of persistence , that kind of focus , is worth a lot of money			1
but do n't make the mistake of chasing the money			2
that 's what got us into this mess in the first place			0
let the money chase you			2
ireport.com : @entity180 - bagging lunch to save money ? send video most people are afraid to do that			1
afraid of the gap in their resume			0
they try to cover it up			0
find ways to explain it away			0
but my advice to employers is hire for the gap			0
it 's often the most interesting part of a person 's life			0
what does a person do when they do n't have anything they have to do ? what do they do in their spare time ? if you can hire someone for that , you 'll find your star			2
this is n't the time to be afraid of risk			2
you 're already in the risk			0
you might not have chosen it , but why not take control and act as if you had ? remember my friend working at the pharmaceutical company -- the one with the job ? by staying in work she does n't love , she 's taking a risk too			1
she 's risking her life			0
imagine how great she would be , how much she would offer , how much she would gain , if she devoted herself to her passion ? now how about you ? let 's become a nation of people who love what we do			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : the recession provides an opportunity as well as a *challenge*
he says people who were working just for money now can *rethink* what they do
he says , if you were laid off , focus your time on what you love doing
