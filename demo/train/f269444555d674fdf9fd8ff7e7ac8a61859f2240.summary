-- the @entity1 has provided an all you can eat buffet when it comes to goals -- but in a tournament which constantly manages to amaze , the latest item on the menu in @entity9 was akin to a feast			0
those fortunate enough to witness this enthralling contest between the attacking talent of the @entity13 and the never - say - die attitude of the @entity15 were arguably treated to the game of the tournament so far			1
the @entity19 , which had trailed 2 - 1 after @entity21 's penalty had given @entity23 shock 54th minute lead , eventually prevailed 3 - 2 in a pulsating and often breathtaking affair			1
@entity27 @entity26 was the hero for the @entity13 , becoming his country 's youngest ever @entity1 scorer , lashing home the winner just 10 minutes after @entity32 had dragged his side level			2
last friday , @entity19 brought the tournament to life with one of the greatest results in recent @entity1 history			1
not only did it defeat the reigning champion , it dragged it off its throne kicking and screaming while @entity44 faces were left red with humiliation			0
it was sweet revenge for the @entity13 , which came so close four years ago only to lose out to @entity49 's winner in @entity50			0
under the guidance of coach @entity54 , who will join @entity55 after the tournament , this current crop of players has emerged as a new force on the world stage			0
while the likes of @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 remain , the exciting youthful talent of @entity60 and defender @entity61 represents the next generation			2
there were some who did n't think the @entity19 would even make it out of the group , let alone launch a @entity1 challenge			2
while the @entity13 should qualify comfortably from its group , it will take a huge effort to thrill as its players have in its opening two games			0
@entity23 , which battled gamely during its 3 - 1 defeat by @entity79 in its opening game , arrived knowing anything but a victory would make progress almost impossible			1
like so many of it sporting teams , @entity23 has a side which refuses to give up hope			2
when @entity63 ran through the heart of the @entity15 defense and fired into the bottom corner with 19 minutes played , it seemed a case of how many goals the @entity13 could rattle in			2
@entity23 's talisman @entity93 had other ideas			1
just seconds after restarting the game , @entity95 sent a pinpoint cross into the @entity13 penalty area where @entity93 met it with an unstoppable left - footed -- a goal reminiscent of @entity103 's wonder strike for the @entity19 at the 1988 @entity105 finals			1
@entity93 's fifth @entity1 goal - and possibly his last -- was worth the entrance fee alone			1
the 34 - year - old will miss his side 's final group game against @entity111 after picking up a suspension -- not that you would have known it from his performance			0
buoyed by the equalizer , @entity23 began to push forward and @entity116 missed a golden opportunity to put his side ahead after lashing over from 18 - yards			1
and when @entity119 inadvertently handled inside his own penalty area , @entity21 swept home from 12 - yards to give his side a shock lead			2
from thrashing the world champion 5 - 1 to trailing the lowest ranked side in the tournament , the @entity13 were rocking			1
@entity23 , playing with a confidence which belied its lowly ranking , appeared set to claim one of the most famous results in its history			0
but the @entity13 were n't done yet and four minutes later it drew level when @entity32 rifled home from just inside the penalty area			0
as the game moved breathlessly from one end to the other , @entity134 should have put @entity23 back in front but could only send his effort straight at the goalkeeper from close - range			1
it was a costly miss which as just minutes later the @entity13 moved ahead once again			0
@entity143 burst forward towards the penalty area and his low effort flew in off the fingertips off @entity23 goalkeeper @entity148			0
there was still time for @entity150 and @entity151 to go close -- but the goals dried up -- for now anyway .			0

@entity19 defeats @entity23 3 - 2 in @entity154
@entity23 had come from goal down to lead 2 - 1
@entity93 scores goal of the tournament
