the aftermath of ' @entity2 ' rumbled on at the @entity3 on friday , with @entity5 star @entity4 saying she was fine with being asked to twirl -- if men were asked to " flex their muscles and stuff			1
" following her second - round victory over @entity13 on wednesday , a male interviewer had asked the 20 - year - old @entity4 for a twirl			1
cue uproar on social media			2
as it turns out , @entity4 's request for greater equality had already been granted before she pirouetted on court			1
in a video posted on the @entity3 's website dated january 19 , 14 - time grand slam winner @entity20 -- known partly for his muscular physique -- was asked to bare his chest			1
the question came not from a man or woman , but from what looked like a tablet device as part of a series where tennis players are quizzed on various subjects as they are driven around @entity35 in a car manufactured by one of the event 's sponsors			0
the exact question to @entity20 was this : " females love when you take your top off			1
can you do it now ? " " i have to do it now ? " replied @entity20 , who was sitting beside his public relations manager			1
he then took off his sweatshirt and began to take off his t - shirt before leaving it on			0
" i am joking , " he said with a smile as the t - shirt stayed on			0
@entity20 's interview has n't attracted much attention , but @entity56 , the 12 - time grand slam winner and longtime advocate for equality , took note of the question to @entity4 -- and was less than amused			1
and in a tweet posted thursday , @entity56 wrote : " the @entity3 interviewer asking the women to ' twirl ' on court is out of line			2
" this is truly sexist			0
if you ask the women , you have to ask the guys to twirl as well			2
let 's focus on competition and accomplishments of both genders and not our looks			0
" amid the controversy @entity4 retained her trademark cool after ousting @entity80 friday			2
" personally , i 'm not offended , " @entity4 said			1
" no , i think it was an in - the - moment thing and it was funny			0
but , yeah , i mean , it 's just funny how it 's taken a life of its own			0
" i 'm just going to try to focus on my tennis			0

@entity4 not " offended " by being asked to twirl
but @entity5 says there should n't be a *double* *standard*
