-- @entity1 may be more used to serving aces than strutting his stuff on a film set but that has not stopped the former world number one from appearing with @entity8 rock star @entity7 in her new music video			0
the scenes of the two stars used to accompany the global release of the " @entity13 " single were filmed in @entity15 , @entity16 last month where the chemistry between the 23 - year - old @entity18 and the @entity20 singer were such that denials were released by both parties to quash rumors of a love match			2
though @entity1 is in no danger of winning an @entity27 for his acting skills , his cameo appearance was just one in a long list of tennis stars who have flirted with the silver screen			1
any come to mind ? @entity35 sifted through the archives to find other famous examples of tennis stars caught on camera			1
let us know if there are any we have missed by adding your comment at the bottom of the page			0
@entity46 : given her status as a celebrity , which rather overshadowed her abilities as a tennis player , the former @entity53 semifinalist and number one ranked doubles player , was inevitably going to turn her talents to acting			1
rather in the @entity1 mode , @entity46 does not have any lines to fluff when appearing with @entity16 pop star @entity60 in a video to promote his 2001 single " escape "			0
having been " seduced " in a variety of role - play settings by @entity60 , the pair later dated in real life			0
the single reached number 12 in the @entity70 listings			0
@entity71 : the former bad boy of tennis , famous for his rants and run - ins with umpires , would appear to have all the ingredients for a director looking to add a star name to his film credits and with a bit of acting ability to boot			1
@entity71 , who was once married to the movie star @entity84 , has in fact appeared in six films , the latest @entity88 's 2008 release " @entity86 " where he predictably plays himself			1
the film did well at the box office and , considering his other cameo alongside @entity92 in " @entity93 , " the grand slam great could be set for further feature film parts			0
but whether he will follow soccer legend @entity97 in taking lead roles in critically acclaimed films may be open to question			2
@entity101 : the @entity104 star 's handsome profile and suave personality lent itself to the movie world and sure enough a @entity108 producer spotted him as he gave a post match television interview			1
he was given an immediate screen test between the second and third rounds while playing at @entity53 and landed more than just a walk - on part in the 13th @entity114 movie " @entity115			1
" rather predictably , @entity101 's role did have a tennis angle with the baddie @entity115 playing at the same club as him , where he was able to keep watch for 007 @entity122			1
@entity101 also kills a kukri - wielding @entity123 with his racket , before getting his come - uppance from one of @entity114 's enemies with a nasty knife			1
he dies muttering the immortal lines " it was @entity115 's men			2
" a later appearance in " @entity133 : @entity133 " marked the end of his film career , but @entity101 made regular appearances on a popular television show on @entity20 network @entity139 to extend his acting career			1
@entity141 : any history of tennis or indeed sport in general , will point to the pivotal role which @entity141 played in breaking down barriers for the @entity147 - @entity20 community			2
as a forerunner for the likes of the @entity151 sisters four decades later , @entity141 became the first black player to win @entity53 in 1957 , before defending the title the year after to add to a career haul of five grand slam singles titles			2
despite the success , @entity141 had never profited from her triumphs as a lifelong amateur so on retirement in 1959 she took a career change that saw her release an album of songs and appear in " @entity165 " , a @entity166 - directed western -- where she played a liberated slave who rides alongside @entity168			1
@entity169 also appeared in the film , but sadly it was @entity141 's first and last and she turned to playing professional golf to earn a living			2
@entity175 : given her worldwide fame and celebrity , the @entity177 tennis icon would appear to be a @entity108 producer 's dream but her chance of celluloid glory was thwarted by -- a @entity108 producer			2
the 2004 feature " @entity53 " starred @entity186 as @entity187 , a single - minded @entity20 tennis star who finds love in the form of a less than dedicated @entity192 player @entity191 ( @entity193 ) , who inspired by @entity194 does the impossible by winning the men 's singles			1
a very unlikely scenario but highly predictable for a feel good film			0
@entity175 was supposed to have played one of @entity194 's hapless opponents , but according to the commentary on the dvd of the film , she was considered too much of a likeness to @entity186 and did not get the part			0
a glut of players , @entity207 , @entity71 ( inevitably ) and @entity208 amongst others lend their faces to the film and @entity0 's @entity35 presenter @entity212 advised on the action shots			0
but one ca n't help but think that an appearance by @entity175 may have boosted box office takings even more , although she did appear at the glitzy premiere in @entity108 in september , 2004 , towering over the diminutive @entity186			0
@entity217 : another infamous tennis star who is rated one of the all - time greats for his grand slam exploits , but attracted less than favorable headlines for his private life , was another to try his hand at entertainment without a tennis racket			0
the controversial life of tennis great @entity217 @entity217 dominated the men 's game in the 1920s before turning professional and was still a force into his 40s , playing to big crowds against the likes of @entity236 and @entity237			0
but away from tennis , @entity217 's great passion was movies and theater			0
he was a personal friend of screen icon @entity242 and ploughed much of his fortune into three @entity244 plays , which he wrote and produced and also appeared in			1
all bombed spectacularly and @entity108 did not come calling			0
@entity246 ( 1979 movie ) this makes our list because of the sheer numbers of star players , who have cameo roles or -- in the case of the great @entity254 -- starred in a major supporting role			1
@entity254 , who received a panning from critics for his pains , also has a credit in the more successful 1953 release " @entity264 " starring screen legends @entity261 and @entity263			0
the corny plot of @entity246 ( see " @entity53 " above ) has crooner @entity267 's son ( @entity266 ) play a rising young tennis star who falls for an older woman @entity269 ( @entity270 )			1
it is loaded with walk on parts for @entity71 , his predecessor as the " enfant terrible " of tennis , @entity277 , and the @entity279 ace @entity278			2
@entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 and @entity283 also appear as well as legendary @entity192 tennis commentator @entity284 , but it proved a turkey			0
roll credits so that 's @entity35 's guide to the best and mostly worse in tennis acting careers , but while the sport remains a favorite among celebrities and rich @entity108 film moguls , the list is sure to grow and as we went to press reports from @entity104 say 11 - time grand slam doubles champion @entity298 is wanting to join the ranks of @entity300 after taking acting lessons for over a year			1
judging by the efforts of his predecessors he might need them .			0
