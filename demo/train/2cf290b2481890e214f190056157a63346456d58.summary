-- an ex-judge accusing @entity5 president @entity4 of manipulating court rulings is a fugitive who " sold his soul to the devil " when he agreed to talk with @entity12 investigators , the nation 's foreign minister said thursday			1
" people like him will keep being defeated and his lies will be unveiled , " foreign minister @entity13 said			1
@entity17 , who was a @entity19 justice until the @entity5 government accused him of connections with an alleged drug trafficker last month , told @entity23 in an interview that aired this week that he made rulings in cases based on requests from @entity4 and other top officials			1
" they just asked for favors that i complied with			2
and woe be the judge that refused to cooperate			0
... they were dismissed , " @entity17 said			0
top @entity5 authorities were aware of at least one instance in which a military lieutenant was caught transporting cocaine to an army camp -- and made personal phone calls asking the judge to look the other way , @entity17 told the @entity44 - based tv network			2
@entity0 has not independently confirmed the former justice 's accusations			2
in recent years , the @entity47 has placed several @entity5 officials , including the nation 's current defense minister , on its drug kingpin list			1
the @entity52 flew @entity17 to the @entity12 from @entity53 early monday morning , according to the head of the @entity57 country 's intelligence agency			1
@entity58 said @entity60 officials contacted the @entity53 government after the former judge -- who had been in @entity53 for about two weeks -- reached out to officials in @entity65			1
the @entity66 told @entity0 it could not comment on what it called " this law enforcement matter			0
" @entity5 's foreign minister criticized the @entity12 for attempting to destabilize his country 's government			1
" it is easy to understand how a fugitive from justice processed for his connections with drug trafficking mafias and removed from his job has sold his soul to the @entity52 , " @entity13 said			1
" the @entity52 has appeared again as a political actor in @entity5 against @entity5			1
" the @entity52 has not commented on @entity17			2
an agency official who watched portions of the interview that aired on @entity0 en @entity84 ol said it was " very interesting			2
" the former justice told @entity23 that high - ranking @entity5 officials were involved in drug trafficking , but declined to say who or offer evidence			1
in one instance , @entity17 said , @entity4 's office called and asked for the former judge 's help after a military lieutenant was caught with cocaine			2
so did the nation 's defense minister and other top officials , @entity17 said			1
they said " he was a good guy , that it was the president 's order , that the president was very interested in the case , " @entity17 said			2
the former judge also described weekly meetings in the @entity5 vice president 's office with the president of the @entity19 , the attorney general and other top officials			1
" that is where the directives of the justice system come from			0
... they decide what guidelines to follow depending on the political climate , " he said			0
@entity17 also said the nation 's prosecutors participated in extortion and had asked him to " orchestrate cases			1
" the attorney general 's office did not respond to requests for comment			2
several of @entity17 's remarks contradicted previous statements by top @entity5 officials -- including @entity4			1
when asked whether there were political prisoners in @entity5 -- something @entity4 has previously denied -- @entity17 said yes			1
" there are people they ordered not to be released			0
... in a nutshell , we had to accept the fact that they were not to be released , so the justice system turned its back on them , " he said			0
asked whether he felt that the @entity5 government had turned against him , @entity17 said , " i think they did that a long time ago			1
i just did n't realize it			0
" @entity5 officials removed @entity17 from his post last month , accusing him of providing a government credential to a man authorities allege was one of the world 's top drug lords			1
@entity17 , who has not confirmed or denied that accusation , left @entity5 the day he was supposed to face questioning in the @entity157			2
a government ethics commission said the judge had committed " serious misconduct " and a " breach of public ethics " when he allegedly provided a credential to suspected drug trafficker @entity161			1
@entity166 is currently on trial in @entity5 , where he is accused of drug trafficking and killing a journalist who was investigating his family			1
he was extradited to @entity5 from @entity171 last year			2
the @entity12 designated @entity166 as one of the world 's most significant drug kingpins in may 2009 and had also requested his extradition			1
@entity166 , who denies @entity12 accusations of drug trafficking , said in an interview with @entity5 's @entity180 newspaper that he paid millions of dollars to government officials and top military brass so his family 's shipping business could operate at some of the nation 's largest ports			1
" if i am a narcotrafficker , the whole @entity4 government is a narcotrafficker , " he told the newspaper			0
@entity4 has strongly denied those accusations and stood up for his government officials			0
@entity13 said thursday that @entity17 's removal from office showed that " in @entity5 the laws work			2
no one is privileged or protected			0
" @entity17 told @entity23 that his daughter had invited @entity166 to her wedding , " but we did n't have any idea of the activities of this gentleman			0
we only knew him as a reputable businessman			0
" the former judge claimed @entity5 officials had unfairly used the @entity161 case to destroy his reputation			1
" i am not going to pay for a crime i never committed , " @entity17 told @entity23 , but he said he wants to make up for the harm his rulings have caused			0
" when i finished packing all my stuff in my office , all my books , i told myself i 'd never touch another law book			0
justice is nothing , justice is a ball of putty			0
i say putty because it can be molded , for or against			0
i did n't want to have anything to do with the law anymore			0
i said i 'd rather have a hotdog stand , " he said			0
" but then , after all my reflection , and i had time to think it over , and after i saw that , that my friends have offered to help me , i now think you need to fight for justice			0
and that blindfolded lady has to be shown the way			0
" saying he felt afraid for his life and betrayed by his colleagues , the former judge said he would go back to @entity5 to face the accusations against him only if officials respect his rights			2
" knowing the system from the inside , and how it works , and how it 's handled , i do n't think i 'd have any rights at all , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245 contributed to this report .			0
