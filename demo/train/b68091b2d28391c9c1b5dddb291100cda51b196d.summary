@entity0 -- @entity2 , the online news website editor who duped @entity6 gov. @entity5 into taking a prank call by posing as a billionaire conservative activist , told @entity1 thursday that @entity5 is a " delusional " politician seeking to help wealthy @entity10 backers			1
@entity2 , editor of the news website " @entity15 , " posed as business tycoon @entity12 while placing a call to @entity5 's office			1
he was able to secure a candid 20 - minute conversation with the governor			2
in a transcript of the conversation on the website , @entity5 discusses the idea of bringing 14 @entity23 state senators -- who left the state to prevent a quorum for discussing the budget bill -- back to the assembly to " talk , not negotiate , " allow them to recess , and then have the 19 @entity10 senators declare a quorum			1
at that point , presumably , the @entity10 - led @entity33 would be able to move forward on the controversial legislation , which would end the state 's public union workers ' collective bargaining rights on all matters but salaries and wages			0
it would also raise the amount they would have to pay into their pensions and health insurance plans			0
@entity2 , posing as @entity12 , suggested " planting some troublemakers " among the people protesting the measure in @entity51			1
" we thought about that , " @entity5 allegedly replied			1
the governor also drew an analogy between his standoff with the @entity6 unions and president @entity59 's decision to fire striking air traffic controllers in 1981			0
" this is our moment , " he said			0
" this is our time to change the course of history			0
" " i think ( @entity5 ) is truly a right - wing delusional person , " @entity2 told @entity1			1
" he believes in the fairy tale " of conservative economic theory			0
" but there 's also got to be another part of him who believes he 'll eventually profit ( by breaking the unions ) and so will the people who back him -- a la @entity12			0
" @entity2 said he hopes " the right thing will happen " and " the unions will come out on top			1
" " my entire adult life has seemed like a series of moments where @entity23 could have revitalized themselves and taken a stand , " @entity2 noted			1
" but every time " they 've shifted to the political center " and lost the opportunity			2
" as a result , " the country 's gone further to the right			0
" @entity5 confirmed wednesday that he had been duped by @entity2			1
but the plan for getting 14 democrats back into the @entity88 to force a quorum on the controversial budget bill is not " a trick , " he insisted			1
it is part of a plan he has discussed publicly in the past , he said			0
" i take phone calls all the time			0
" @entity5 said at a news conference			2
" the things i said are the things i 've said publicly all along			1
the fact of the matter is people have brought up all sorts of different options			0
" @entity5 continued : " in terms of other ways to come on in , it 's not a trick			2
we 've said it point blank ; come on in and talk about it , i 'm willing to talk about it ... but i ultimately believe it needs to lead to a vote			0
i do n't think that 's a trick , i think that 's something i 've said time and time again in front of all of you here , and stated very frankly			0
" now , i 'm not going to allow one prank phone call to be a distraction from the reality that we have a job to do , and the job is to debate this bill , and you 're only able to debate it if you 're in the @entity88 , focused on the task at hand			2
" @entity5 raised the specter of layoffs " that would affect 1,500 individuals " if the @entity23 senators do not return to @entity51 promptly			1
describing the legislation as a necessary precursor to the process of producing a budget that addresses @entity6 's $ 3.6 billion deficit , @entity5 on wednesday said that if is n't passed by week 's end , or " we lose out on about $ 165 million in savings " that the bill generates for debt restructuring , it could result in further layoffs			2
" for us to lock in those savings , to have that done in anticipation of the budget bill , we need one thing and we need one thing in particular			0
and that is for those 14 state senators to come back to @entity6 to debate this bill , to participate in democracy and to allow us to move forward , and to do ultimately the job they were elected to do , " @entity5 said .			1

@entity2 calls gov. @entity5 " delusional " and a " right - winger "
