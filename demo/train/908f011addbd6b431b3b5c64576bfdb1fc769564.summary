-- if anyone 's going to be the last man on @entity4 , then @entity1 seems like an ideal candidate			1
@entity1 plays the survivor of a plague in " @entity8			1
" cool and athletic , focused and unflappable , he 's not someone who 's going to give up on humanity just because the odds are stacked against him			1
even at several billion to one , he 's still adamant he can fix this thing			2
a third movie version of @entity16 's classic sci - fi novel " @entity8 " has been on the table at @entity18 for a long time			1
in the ' 90s , @entity19 talked about following in the footsteps of @entity21 and @entity22 ( remember " the @entity23 " ? )			0
@entity1 is such a different type , it 's odd to think that he 's taken over this mantle			1
in fact , he 's scored consistently well in sci - fi , from " @entity38 " through " @entity29 " and " @entity30 , " and there 's no reason to suppose the tense , scary " @entity8 " wo n't continue that impressive box office run , even if the movie itself flags on the last lap. the opening could n't be sharper			1
a television news report hails a medical breakthrough -- a viral cure for cancer , no less			1
cut to @entity44 three years later : abandoned cars , no one in sight , grass growing waist - high around @entity49			1
something has gone very , very wrong			0
the cover of @entity53 on his fridge door pictures a " soldier			0
savior ? " but that hanging question mark is well chosen , and we divine that his immunity is pure chance			0
he 's not quite alone			0
@entity51 patrols @entity64 in his @entity65 with @entity66 , a @entity67 ( also immune to the airborne virus ) , broadcasting into the void , then returning home to his @entity72 townhouse to put up the shutters before nightfall			0
that 's when the " @entity76 " venture out : feral , contaminated people with a rabid appetite for flesh but no pupil dilation reflex to protect them against sunlight			1
by now , anyone who caught " @entity84 " or last year 's sequel " 28 weeks later " may be experiencing deja vu -- in fact , if they called this movie " 2.8 years later " it could pass as the third installment in the series with very little tweaking			2
which is not to downplay the special frisson of seeing the @entity94 ripped across the middle , for example			0
wisely dispensing with the @entity98 rhetoric that bogged down " the @entity23 , " " @entity8 " does n't have much time for @entity51 the soldier			0
while @entity22 dedicated himself to exterminating the albino hordes , @entity1 starts out firmly on the other end of the kill - or - cure scale			1
at the same time , the film suggests his self - sufficient scientific rationalism is not enough			0
by day 1,001 he 's on the point of suicide -- which is when the movie gets @entity109 in the comely intervention of born - again @entity111			2
if the last half - hour feels thrown together , " @entity113 " director @entity112 mostly makes a virtue of the lean script , getting in and out quick , suppressing those inevitable nagging questions ( are cockroaches immune ? ) , always stressing @entity51 's solitary isolation			2
so often , sci - fi is overproduced , but " @entity8 " does n't look like a @entity122 extravaganza			1
it looks like an edgy suspense movie shot on the fly in @entity44 after the fall			2
and because of that , it 's all the more effective			0
" @entity8 " is rated @entity129 and runs 100 minutes			0
for @entity131 's take , click here			0

three years after a medical breakthrough , something is wrong in @entity44
@entity1 is cool and unflappable as he takes on flesh - *eating* *mutants*
version of @entity16 's sci - fi novel flags at the end but mostly good
