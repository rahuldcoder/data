-- @entity1 wanted to live forever			1
just a year and a half before his death , i conducted what ended up being the last major interview with the reclusive @entity1 in his suite at the @entity8 in @entity9			1
and his words stopped me			0
" let 's face it			1
who wants mortality ? everybody wants immortality , " he told me that warm september afternoon			1
" you want what you create to live , be it sculpture or painting or music			0
like @entity24 said , ' i know the creator will go but his work survives			0
that 's why to escape death i attempt to bind my soul to my work			2
' that 's how i feel			2
i give my all at work			0
' cause i want it to just live			0
" most of us remember where we were when we heard that he was dead			0
i was mowing the lawn at my house outside @entity40 when i got the first call			0
in fact , i got several calls and texts with the bulletin -- first from @entity46 and then from the @entity47 -- that he had died			2
but it was n't until i heard @entity0 's @entity50 announce it at 6:28 p.m. et that i finally believed it			2
sure , i was shocked when i heard the news that the @entity1 had left the world			1
but , in a way , i was not all that surprised			0
@entity1 , even as troubled as he was , had given his all to the world during his 50 years on the planet			1
and now he was in the hands of history			0
just before that interview for @entity59 , i watched his youngest son , @entity60 , then 7 , politely greet me at the hotel room door and his father quickly correct him -- " blanket , you shake with your right hand , not with your left " -- and in that moment i saw what those kids meant to him			2
it was indeed his children -- @entity71 , now 17 , @entity72 , now 16 , and @entity60 , now 12 -- who gave us those dozen or so extra years of @entity1 's life			1
@entity1 was a true father , and those kids were his heart			1
they gave his later life meaning			0
never mind those images of a newborn prince @entity82 dangling from that hotel balcony in @entity84 , or pictures of the kids wearing masks while being shuttled around by their dad			0
away from the cameras and publicists and crowds , @entity1 was about as regular a father as someone like him could be			1
that 's why it was even more tragic that he died just four days after @entity96			1
so , five years later , it is those kids who stand to benefit most from his immortality			1
if the lawyers and accountants and @entity102 get out of the way -- the @entity104 reported that more than $ 91 million of the $ 600 million his estate has earned since his death has gone to taxes and licenses , and another $ 32 million went to lawyers and the executors of his estate -- the three children and his mother will do quite well for the rest of their lives			0
as a musical wonder at age 8 , he and his brothers defined a genre of music in the ' 70s			0
when he left the @entity125 and went on his own in the early ' 80s , he did it again with his " @entity128 " and " @entity129 " albums , shattering just about every record held to date			0
he sold out concerts around the world , rescued a stalled music industry and single - handedly put @entity134 on the map -- " nobody had ever seen anything like that , " legendary superproducer @entity139 once told me , after the " @entity129 " video debuted on the fledgling music network			2
" that album sold something like a million and a half copies per week after we put that video out			0
" still , when @entity1 died , he had amassed nearly a half billion dollars in various debts -- to banks , bodyguards and other creditors , @entity148 reported			1
that debt had largely been wiped out in the first year following his death , due to huge posthumous cd sales and film proceeds			0
in the last year alone , his estate has seen a slew of projects : -- " @entity162 , " a new album of never - before - released @entity1 songs reproduced by executive producer @entity165 debuted at no. 2 on the @entity161 charts last month			1
-- " @entity166 , " a @entity169 @entity168 extravaganza featuring his music and dance moves , and " @entity172 , " a slick companion show that is now traveling the country , with more than 500 performances so far			0
-- numerous books , documentaries and the film " @entity179 " have tried to capture @entity1 's life			1
the latest book , " @entity182 : protecting @entity1 in his final days , " by two of his bodyguards , just hit bookstores			1
@entity1 's legacy : music , family and ' what if ? ' even a makeup - stained chair , allegedly from @entity1 's rented @entity194 mansion where he died , just went on sale on @entity196 with a starting price of $ 30,000			1
in death , everybody still wants to get paid by @entity1			1
in the past five years there have been lawsuits -- his mother , @entity202 , sued promoter @entity203 , claiming more than $ 1 billion in damages			2
she said the promoter was liable for the star 's wrongful death , but a jury ruled against her last year and she collected nothing			2
there have been tragedies -- @entity1 's daughter , @entity72 , who took his death the hardest , found herself in a hospital bed last year after reportedly trying to slit her wrists			1
and there has been drama			0
@entity1 's personal physician , dr. @entity218 , was convicted on involuntary manslaughter charges for causing the star 's death as a result of an overdose of the powerful surgical anesthetic propofol			1
he was released in 2013 , two years early , due to prison overcrowding			2
but through it all , @entity1 somehow lives on			1
thinking back to that last conversation with him , i did n't know when i sat down next to him on that burgundy couch that his last words to me would be prophetic			0
" to escape death i attempt to bind my soul to my work			0
" @entity1 , through his work , wanted to live forever			2
and , based on what has happened in the five years since he died , he might just make it			2
join us on @entity239 / @entity238 .			0
