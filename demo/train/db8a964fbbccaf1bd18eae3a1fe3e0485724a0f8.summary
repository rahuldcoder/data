-- every time i think the @entity2 can not get any more tone - deaf on issues involving race and equal rights , someone in leadership proves me wrong			1
in case you missed it , a group of @entity2 senators -- @entity20 of @entity21 , @entity22 of @entity23 , @entity15 " @entity19 " sessions of @entity16 and @entity17 of @entity18 -- have decided that we might need to revisit the @entity26 's provision granting citizenship to people born in the @entity29			1
this development , in response to illegal immigrants whose children are born in the @entity29 , is simply stunning and reckless			2
can anyone seriously argue that the @entity2 has not been hijacked by extremists ? even once - sensible conservatives like @entity22 have drifted to a hard - right ideology so extreme that people of color , in this case @entity39 , will be hard - pressed to find a home in the @entity2			1
these calls to revisit and possibly repeal the 14th @entity26 's naturalization clause is a very bad sign of things to come on the immigration front , and we should all pay close attention as we head into the 2010 election cycle			0
ironically , if you look at the @entity54 website " @entity55 , " a timeline shows that the party founded in part by @entity58 was once very progressive			0
it points out that a @entity60 drafted and passed the 14th amendment without a single @entity63 vote			1
the lead sponsor was a @entity2 congressman from @entity66			0
boy , have times changed			0
the 14th amendment , adopted in 1868 in the aftermath of the @entity71 , granted citizenship to " all persons born or naturalized in the @entity29 , " including recently freed slaves			1
the 14th amendment intended to ensure civil rights to ex-slaves , or as we like to say , " equal protection , " to those slaves under the laws			1
according to the @entity82 , about 10.8 million illegal immigrants were living in the @entity29 in january 2009			0
the @entity83 estimates that in 2008 , 3.8 million illegal immigrants had children who were @entity29 citizens			0
from the viewpoint of these conservative senators , repealing the citizenship clause could put a very swift end to the practice of people illegally crossing our borders to give birth so their children will be legal citizens of the @entity29			2
but here is what troubles me most as an @entity99 : once again , the @entity2 is clueless to the ramifications of its public policy stances			0
even sen. @entity102 , who is in a tough primary fight , has said we should look into the citizenship - by - birth provision			0
tinkering with the 14th @entity26 opens the door to further tinkering with the @entity107 -- and when it comes to that , we should all take a hard pause			2
like many @entity29 , i am concerned about the immigration challenge confronting our nation			2
but revisiting or reviewing the 14th @entity26 is the wrong answer			2
to the @entity2 leadership i would simply ask : what are you thinking ? how in the world can you believe that this latest stunt will help you broaden your outreach to @entity39 and blacks ? how in the world can a party that did so many things right during its early days in the 19th century -- ended slavery , championed the 13th , 14th and 15th amendments , started @entity126 -- end up so lost and monolithic in the 21st ? i would respectfully suggest that leaders in the @entity2 , who want to achieve a governing majority once again in this century , had better get under control , or better yet oust , those members who are playing to the worst of racial fears this fall			1
immigration is a serious problem indeed , but it is not one that will be solved by stripping away the rights of citizenship to those born in the @entity29			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity140 .			0

@entity140 : @entity2 , once progressive , now tone - deaf on race and *ethnicity*
immigration woes wo *n't* be helped by @entity2 revisiting 14th amendment , she says
@entity2 helped pass 14th amendment granting citizenship to those born in @entity29
@entity152 : tinkering with @entity107 wrong ; would *alienate* blacks , @entity39
