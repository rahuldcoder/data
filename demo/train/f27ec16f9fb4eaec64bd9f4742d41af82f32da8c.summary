@entity1 , @entity0 -- we 've become used to a world where what we buy is determined by what products are stocked by a handful of chain stores , but there are signs that may be changing			0
the future could be one of thriving cottage industries and skilled artisans lovingly producing custom - made wares			2
an " apple jacket , " by jacquelineknits , is just one of the handmade items you can find on @entity20			1
that 's the vision of @entity20 , a @entity25 - based web site that describes itself as " an online crafts fair			1
" but unlike your local sunday - morning market , @entity20 's crafts fair has some 200,000 stall holders , who have this year sold just under $ 50 million - worth of their homemade goods			1
the site was conceived and launched in 2005 by @entity35 , a carpenter , among other things , who was looking for somewhere to sell his work online			1
at the time , the only real outlet was @entity41 , but @entity35 was looking for something different , something that would provide a place for small - time artisans to sell their creations			1
but according to @entity20 , the site is more than simply a good business opportunity			1
" one of our goals is to change the way the economy works			0
it 's become normal for people to buy online and the spread of the online buying culture means it has become very democratic			0
if you have a computer and camera and you like to make things , you can make and sell anything you want			0
i consider it liberating for people , " an @entity20 spokesman told @entity2			2
if the site 's popularity is anything to go buy , it 's a model that 's proved tremendously successful			0
but the reason for that success is that @entity20 has tapped into a growing pool of crafters and a demand for handmade goods			1
in the @entity25 especially , there has recently been a resurgence in the popularity of handmade goods			1
the idea has even emerged of crafting as a form of political activism -- the term " @entity80 " has been coined to describe the idea of ' making your own ' as a statement against runaway consumerism and the homogeneity of mass production			0
a survey carried out by @entity20 earlier this year revealed the average age of its crafter / sellers to be 35 -- a far cry from the stereotypical image of grandma knitting a scarf in her rocking chair			2
tapping into that zeitgeist , @entity20 has tried to create a crafting community by hosting online crafting workshops and offering advice on how to turn a hobby into a business			2
the site encourages interaction between crafters , but crucially , it enables interaction between buyers and sellers			2
" anyone can go to , say , @entity109 and get a sweater , but then you have the same sweater as millions of people , but there 's no real meaning to it			0
it 's really great to be able talk to the person who made something that you now own -- it gives it another layer of meaning and specialness that a lot of people are looking to find , " said the spokesman			0
do you prefer handmade to mass produced ? interestingly , @entity20 also offers a service called @entity132 , where buyers request a specific product they want made , along with a deadline and price range , and sellers bid to provide that product for a certain fee			1
that concept of ' merchandise on demand ' turns the idea of mass production on its head , but @entity148 web site @entity146 of @entity149 takes the idea one stage further			1
designer @entity152 set up @entity146 of @entity149 when he realized there was a demand for customized sneakers			0
as well as adorning plain white plimsolls with his own colorful creations , @entity152 lets his customers send him their own graphics , which he turns into a design for them			2
" personally , i 've never bought anything mass produced			0
i think fashion is about being individual and not wearing the same thing as everything else , otherwise it almost becomes a uniform , " @entity152 told @entity2			0
next month he intends to launch a new site that will allow users to create their own designs online , an extension of the shoe customizing offered by @entity172 and @entity173 , which let you personalize your sneakers ' color scheme online			2
the design - your - own trend is growing and it 's not just limited to sneakers			1
@entity181 lets you customize your own t - shirts , mugs , plates , skateboards , postcards , ties , aprons and pretty much anything else that has a printed image on it			1
it 's just a matter of importing the image you want to use , adding some text , if that 's what you want , and clicking ' ok			0
' the result wo n't make @entity197 lose any sleep , but it will be unique			0
while it 's very different experience from that offered by @entity20 , @entity181 does have tools that let you sell your designs on their web site			1
at first glance , @entity25 online t - shirt firm @entity205 is a similar proposition , but what sets @entity205 apart is the way it determines which t - shirt designs it sells			1
@entity205 lets members of the public send in their own t - shirt designs , which are then displayed on its website			1
the site 's 800,000 users can view the designs and vote for the ones they 'd like to see printed			2
each week , six designs , selected from around 800 submissions , make it onto t - shirts , which are then sold on the web site			1
the designers receive $ 2,000 in cash and $ 500 in gift certificates			0
what 's clever about the @entity205 method is that it means the t - shirts it manufactures have always been extensively market tested -- by the same target market it 's pitching its product to			1
it 's an example of what has become known as ' crowdsourcing ' -- getting members of the public to collectively perform a task usually done by a professional			0
although the term has been applied to some very different projects , at its best it 's profoundly democratic -- and it 's made possible by the @entity245			2
kings of @entity247 , @entity181 and @entity205 can only exist because the @entity245 allows interaction between buyer and seller			1
similarly , @entity35 started @entity20 because he could n't afford to rent a physical shop in @entity252 to sell his work from			2
by providing a virtual shop floor , and a potentially huge passing trade , the internet is a leveler that allows the artisan to compete with the chain store			0
with the idea of designing - your - own gaining currency , the emergence of a growing army of crafters , and a way for them to sell their product , all that 's needed for a shopping revolution is a consuming public ready to ditch the chain stores in favor of the artisans			1
@entity41 recently announced a new web venture called @entity275 , which will provide a shop front for all manner of mostly handmade , ethically supplied goods from around the world			0
the idea is similar to @entity20 , but with a global , ' fair trade ' spin , and the involvement of web giant @entity41 is a sure sign that handmade has gone mainstream			1
" in my opinion , in the @entity25 and the western world there is a backlash now			0
brand names were really popular in the 80s and 90s , but now i think people are kind of tired of that -- they want something that 's more tailored to them , " @entity20 's spokesman said			0
if he 's right , and we see a growth in craftspeople and artisans selling directly to the public , then the commerce of the future may bear an uncanny resemblance to that of the past .			0

@entity25 - based web site " @entity20 " is ' an online crafts fair ' with 200,000 sellers
there is a growing demand for handmade and personalized products
" @entity205 " lets it users design t - shirts and vote for the best ones
the @entity245 gives artisans an outlet to sell their handmade products
