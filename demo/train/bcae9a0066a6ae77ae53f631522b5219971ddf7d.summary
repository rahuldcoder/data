-- in the 1990s , a professor at a medical university in @entity3 decided to test his students ' knowledge about the progress of global development			1
he was staggered to discover the class , some of the brightest people in @entity11 , scored fewer than two out of five on average			0
chimpanzees randomly choosing answers would likely have done better , scoring half right			0
that academic was @entity17 , professor of @entity19 at the @entity20 and a medical doctor who had carried out decades of research in @entity23 , discovering the complexities of the continent ( and a new disease ) along the way			1
his work in @entity23 had resulted in " an enormous intellectual irritation that we lumped countries as different as @entity32 and @entity33 together under the label ' the developing world '			1
" @entity17 has been on a mission to inform since the realization that his students -- and his fellow professors -- were somewhat woefully informed about the state of the world			1
today @entity0 publishes @entity42 's latest survey of the @entity43 which shows @entity43 , like most of the world , are far behind the reality in their understanding of world development but ahead of some -- for example , @entity11			2
he wants to challenge the preconceptions we all have about the state of progress in the world , hoping that if we recognize our ignorance we can see what has been achieved and tackle the outstanding problems			2
in 2005 , he co-founded the @entity60 , which aims to " promote a fact - based world view			1
" the following year , @entity17 spoke at a conference run by @entity63 -- the non profit organization " devoted to ideas worth spreading			1
" " the problem for me was not ignorance , " he told the audience , " it was preconceived ideas			1
" @entity17 's striking data presentation , showcasing software developed by @entity73 , has since been viewed more than six million times through @entity63 , which describes him as a " data visionary			1
" you can watch the video here or to the left of this text			0
in may 2012 , @entity81 named @entity17 one of the " @entity84 's @entity83			1
" describing @entity17 for the @entity81 list , @entity86 social scientist @entity85 said he was " in the vanguard of a critically important activity : advancing the public understanding of science			1
" now @entity17 , and @entity73 , are testing that public understanding , this year conducting web - based " ignorance surveys " -- in @entity11 and @entity93 , and , most recently , the @entity43			1
want to test your knowledge ? then click on the image at the top of this article to complete the same survey and compare how you did to the @entity43 respondents			0
click here for the @entity43 results on @entity103 how did you go ? was your global perception spot on ? or did you display a lack of understanding of the progress in education , health and fertility reduction and income inequality in the world ? more importantly , what was it that led to your choices ? if your answers were correct , were they based on factual knowledge ? or did you follow the example of chimpanzees and guess randomly ? is it possible that you were informed by the " toxic combination of arrogance and ignorance " @entity17 believes is often displayed by western @entity127 and @entity128 -- the " @entity124			1
" as a university lecturer , he saw that his students had " a very old view of the world			1
" " there was constant discussion of the world in terms of ' we and they ' , " he said			2
@entity17 realized the concept of " developed " and " developing " countries was hindering understanding of the emerging world , giving an impression of remaining homogeneity of a so - called " developing world "			1
the terms did not describe " the enormous difference between @entity32 and @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150			0
" @entity17 's corporate audiences also failed to understand the characteristics of each country : " they had a sort of regional concept of the world that said ' @entity161 is like this , @entity152 is like that , the @entity151 is like that ' , " he said			1
" we have the @entity165 and @entity166 bordering ... @entity167 and @entity168 -- @entity167 can compete with the @entity43 on child mortality			0
" there 's no homogeneity between @entity173 and @entity174 but between @entity174 and @entity176 , there 's no major difference , " he said			0
" i think that it 's the failure to grasp that the new emerging world has countries on each and every level that makes people fail so badly on the world test			2
" read more : why ' developing vs. developed ' world is now meaningless the world was easier to explain 50 years ago , @entity17 says			1
" once a third of the population was living separated from the rest at the rich end -- they called themselves @entity193			0
" while too many people were still living with the misery of poverty , he said the new reality was that there was a continuous variation of socioeconomic levels			0
" as late as the late 1970s it was still a camel with two humps ... today the camel is dead -- it has been replaced by a dromedary with one hump , " he said			0
" i used to say you ca n't divide the population of @entity208 into clever and stupid , " @entity17 said			1
" the vast majority is in the middle -- that 's how the world is today			2
" " when we ask about literacy rates in the world , when we ask about life expectancy , the percentage of children vaccinated ... people think about @entity220 , @entity150 , @entity148 -- the worst - off cases -- and then they extrapolate to the rest of what they still think is a developing world			1
" they understand there is a huge disparity between the richest and the poorest but then they think there is a big hump in the poor and sick end -- that 's not the case anymore , " he said			0
@entity233 progress and @entity17 says it 's a mistake to assume a country 's economic position matches its social development			1
" today the social dimension of life progresses much , much , faster than the economic , " he said			0
" @entity241 today has the same life expectancy , the same disease burden , as the @entity43 had in 1980 -- they 're only 30 years behind			0
but economically they correspond to the @entity43 in 1880 -- they are still 130 years behind economically , " he said			0
" it means today , countries get healthy before they get rich			0
people 's skill are ahead of their economy			0
" @entity17 said that for him the most surprising lack of knowledge demonstrated in the quiz was on the measles vaccination			1
just 17 % of the @entity43 respondents chose the correct answer -- 80 % of the world 's children are vaccinated by their first birthday			2
forty - four per cent wrongly guessed a fifth of children and 39 % said half			2
" that to me was absolutely astonishing because it is the most solid and stable success of the world			2
now we vaccinate 4 out of 5 children , " said @entity17			1
" it 's a beautiful example of global collaboration , life saving technology , the flagship of aid , awareness among governments and parents in even the poorest countries -- and it 's not known			0
" @entity280 and @entity281 @entity17 says his experience suggests that the ceo 's of the world 's biggest companies have the most fact - based knowledge , seeking for example to move research and development to @entity281 and @entity280 and competing for the skilled workforce , wherever they were born and trained			1
the two countries , 25 years ago known for cheap goods produced by low paid workers , were now competing at engineering level , he said " and that professional skill is also happening faster than the economic growth			0
" " [ their engineers ] are much , much more competent than their income suggests			0
" @entity17 pointed to last week 's results from the @entity304 's measure of school achievement , the " @entity307 " tests			1
@entity11 , he said had fallen in maths more than any other country			0
" the shining star in the world is @entity312 , " he said			2
" that 's what @entity314 from big companies say -- ' if i want mathematical analytical work done , it 's done in @entity280 '			0
" @entity17 warned however that it would be a mistake to assume that poverty was no longer an issue , and that while income inequality between countries had decreased , inside most nations it had widened			1
" there is still a severe and scary amount of extreme poverty in rural parts of @entity281 , @entity220 , @entity150 , @entity331 and @entity23 , " he said			1
predicting the wants of middle income countries is comparatively easy he says -- they are things such as education , hot and cold water , refrigeration and transport , in short modern homes and lives			0
" but how fast extreme poverty will leave @entity150 , northern @entity342 -- that 's difficult to predict , but it will			0
if it does n't , the world as a whole will have a major problem -- it wo n't function with collapsed areas			2
to me it seems easier to end it fast instead of slowly , as the population keeps growing so fast in the poorest communities			0
" @entity17 describes his role at @entity73 as " @entity354 , " and says he aims to convey deadly serious facts with humour -- and compete with tabloids maintaining content worthy of the @entity359 , of which he is a member			2
the @entity361 survey is one way of encouraging people to adopt a fact - based view of the world			1
" we see that this as the theoretical part of a driving license , " he said			0
" it tells you how to drive , not where to drive			0
" it is the structure in which you can put more detailed knowledge of the world			2
" the @entity43 survey was the third of its kind undertaken by the @entity60 , a non-profit organization with the stated aim of " fighting devastating ignorance with fact - based world views everyone can understand			1
@entity73 put 10 questions to 1015 online respondents in november 2013			0
those surveyed were based across the @entity43 , aged 18 and above and had educations ranging from less than high school qualification to doctorates			2
@entity73 have done the surveys in close collaboration with @entity11 survey company , @entity393 .			0

@entity17 is a medical doctor and lecturer who spent decades working in @entity23
