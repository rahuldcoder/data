-- @entity1 has demanded a full list of any other chemicals that might have leaked from a @entity5 - area storage plant after its owners revealed another compound had spilled into the @entity8			1
the state @entity9 gave @entity11 until wednesday afternoon to disclose " any and all information " related to the january 9 spill			1
the move came a day after the company told regulators that in addition to the methanol compound that escaped from a ruptured tank , a second chemical -- a mix of polyglycol ethers , known as @entity20 -- was part of the leak			2
@entity20 is not believed to pose any new health hazard for the people of @entity5 , the federal @entity26 said			1
but the state environmental agency said failing to accurately report the makeup of the leak is a violation of state law			0
" these materials were not included in the initial information regarding the composition of the spilled materials , " the agency stated in a wednesday order to @entity35			0
in a statement issued along with the order , @entity9 chief @entity40 called the late disclosure " completely unacceptable			1
" more than 7,000 gallons of 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol , known as @entity44 , leaked into @entity5 's water supply after it leaked out of a @entity11 storage tank			2
the result was a do - not - use order that left about 300,000 people in the area unable to drink or bathe in their water , some for more than a week			1
the @entity26 said little is known about the health hazards of @entity20 , but it appears to be less toxic than @entity44 and made up about 5 % of the total volume of the leaking tank			2
" given the small percentage of @entity20 in the tank and information suggesting similar water solubility as @entity44 , it is likely that any amount of @entity20 currently in the water system would be extremely low , " it said			0
" however , the water system has not been tested for this material			0
" faced with numerous lawsuits as a result of the spill , @entity11 filed for bankruptcy protection last week			0
the company had no immediate response to wednesday 's demand from state officials , who have pledged to step up their oversight of the industry .			0

the second chemical is *n't* believed to pose new health risks , the @entity26 says
it escaped from the same tank that leaked on january 9 outside @entity5
a state official called the late disclosure " completely unacceptable "
the january 9 leak prompted a do - not - use order for up to 300,000 people
