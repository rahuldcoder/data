-- " for the workers at @entity2 and their families absorbing this difficult news today , we will make sure that you are not left behind			1
" so tweeted the @entity7 premier @entity6 , as @entity8 , the local subsidiary of the @entity10 giant , this week confirmed the worst kept secret in @entity7 manufacturing			1
more than 1,000 workers will lose their jobs when @entity2 closes two production facilities in the state of @entity17 by october 2016			1
the decision came after @entity8 declared a a $ 141 million [ $ 135.4 million ] tax loss for the year 2012/13			2
the company has lost around a $ 600 million [ $ 575 million ] over the last five years , making it unviable , it says , to continue producing cars in @entity7			1
the decision is a blow not only to those who will lose their jobs			1
it 's also bad news for the ruling @entity27 government , about to face an election it 's tipped to lose			1
it also comes amid concerns that while @entity7 's mining boom appears to have peaked , the country 's manufacturing base is in decline			1
@entity8 president and chief executive @entity36 said the company had failed to " make the numbers work " when it modeled a number of different scenarios in an attempt to maintain its @entity7 production base			1
a small and fragmented @entity7 market and uncompetitive cost structures are to blame , according to @entity36			1
" there 's been a significant change in terms of the total number of vehicles sold in the large car segment , " he told a media conference			0
he added " costs are double that of @entity55 and nearly four times @entity2 in @entity56			1
" the news , which will also impact the vehicle manufacturing supply chain across the country , comes despite attempts by the @entity7 government to prop up the industry			1
in the past decade the @entity7 government has given the auto industry a $ 12 billion [ $ 11.5 billion ] in subsidies -- with @entity2 itself the beneficiary of a $ 2.5 billion of those subsidies			1
but the automaker 's decision to close manufacturing completely by 2016 is likely to add to the growing concerns that @entity7 is too reliant on its mining industry and resource exports to @entity74 in particular , whilst its manufacturing base has been in steady decline over more than four decades			1
in the 1960s , manufacturing accounted for close to 30 % of gdp			0
in 2012 , it accounted 7.2 %			0
the @entity81 , an employers organization , said manufacturers were doing it tough in a " high cost economy " while opposition leader @entity84 lamented a " black day for manufacturing in @entity7			1
" but respected commentator @entity86 said the news was long overdue and unrepresentative of the state of @entity7 manufacturing			1
" these are n't the numbers of a company suffering increased competition from a stronger currency , but a company that ca n't convince consumers to buy its flagship product any more , a company that has lost touch with consumers , as so often happens with protected industries , " he wrote in news outlet @entity96			2
" nor is the closure representative of @entity7 manufacturing			1
for all the stories about high - profile manufacturers struggling , in the year to february the total manufacturing workforce fell by just 3,000 , or a third of 1 % , to 954,000 in trend terms -- the lowest fall in years			0
" but manufacturing , once @entity7 's largest employer , has seen its share of total employment eclipsed by the health , retail and construction sectors			1
contrary to popular belief , the mining industry upon which @entity7 remains reliant is not the countries biggest employer , according to analysis published on @entity96			1
@entity123 , economic commentator and author of " the @entity7 moment , " a book that tracks @entity7 's economic development said " all first world economies have roughly similar stories to tell on manufacturing			2
" @entity132 was the single biggest employer through till the 90s in some countries			0
but its share of employment and of @entity79 is declining			0
and it 's quite a smooth line , which started in the 60s , " he told @entity0			0
" but now we are at that point where societies are starting to ask themselves whether they let the trend continue to the point where they actually lose the know - how to make things			2
" he added : " @entity74 will see the same decline in 20 or 30 years time			0
they will replicate first world trends but with a lag			0
" though it employs fewer @entity7 , and despite the boom appearing to have peaked , @entity7 's mining industry remains the headline act			1
profitable , it provides a significant percentage of company tax revenue to government , even if the tax on super profits imposed by the @entity6 government has been a disappointment ; the government 's projections of a a $ 2 billion windfall delivered only a $ 127 million because the tax is structured to allow the miners to offset the value of their mines against the tax			0
former finance minister @entity172 has warned in the past that @entity7 needs to reduce its reliance on mining and focus its efforts on other export industries			2
" minerals are always going to be critical for @entity7			2
there 's no question about that , " he told @entity180			0
however , the diversification of @entity7 exports had stagnated in the 90s , with growth in tourism , education and specialized manufacturing moving into reverse , he said			2
" so it 's not so much that there 's one country that we 're dependent on			0
it 's that we have i think to some extent too many eggs in that basket , " said @entity196			0
for @entity123 , @entity7 's economic reliance on mining would be more acceptable if it had the future firmly in sight			2
" when mining crowds everything out and the economy makes room for that , to service @entity74 , knowing that it 's a highly volatile global cycle , it becomes a question of what @entity7 does with the spoils , " he told @entity0			1
" because there will be a bust , " he added			0
@entity123 says historically , @entity7 has wisely invested the spoils			2
" we built @entity217 out of the gold boom , " he said			0
" but we have n't really taken the cash from this mining boom and reinvested it in expanding the capacity of the rest of the economy			0
" the @entity6 government has anticipated a second mining boom , he says , and allocated spending in anticipation			0
" but the second chance has been denied us by @entity55 and the global financial crisis			0
we had a second crisis and @entity55 is still in recession			0
" even so , though mining profits are down because of lower commodity prices , profit margins remain high			0
according to the @entity235 , last year the industry paid in excess of $ 20 billion in company tax and royalties combined -- a four-fold increase on the $ 4 billion to $ 5 billion paid at the start of the boom			0
what future exists for manufacturing in @entity7 when the countries finite resources are depleted is a question that no doubt will have to wait until after the september 14 poll .			2

more than 1,000 workers will lose their jobs when @entity2 closes two production facilities
the decision is a blow to those who will lose their jobs and bad news for @entity27 government
it comes despite attempts to prop up the industry by the @entity7 government
it raised questions over the structure of the @entity7 economy
