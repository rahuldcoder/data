-- it may seem counter intuitive			0
but sometimes you 've got to go backwards to go forwards			0
so it goes for arguably the world 's greatest race horse , who will attempt to extend her remarkable undefeated winning streak this weekend -- by running in the opposite direction			1
when @entity11 champion thoroughbred , @entity12 , tries to rewrite the record books yet again in her 25th race at @entity17 's @entity16 on saturday , it will be in a clockwise direction -- as is the norm for the @entity21 state			1
but it will be a change of pace for the @entity25 mare , better used to racing in an anti-clockwise direction in her native @entity28			1
a strange @entity11 tradition means horses race either left or right , depending on which state they 're in -- clockwise for @entity21 and @entity34 , and anti-clockwise for @entity28 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
this will be just the fourth time the superstar six - year - old -- worth $ 7.5 million in prize money -- will have raced clockwise , and co-owner @entity42 admitted it presented the biggest challenge to her undefeated winning streak			1
" it does take time for her to settle in , running in the reverse direction , " @entity42 told @entity0			2
" so that 's our biggest concern			0
but i still ca n't see any horse catching her			0
" since demolishing the field in her first major win at the @entity60 in 2009 , an air of mystique has followed world champion thoroughbred			0
the wonder mare , who even has her own @entity65 handle , has not just won all 24 of her races -- with the exception of @entity70 's @entity69 she has won them by staggering margins , destroying world - class fields to become one of the top - rated race horses on the planet			1
her unblemished record is the second highest of all time , trailing behind only @entity82 horse @entity80 , which apparently took 54 races in the late 1800s			2
@entity12 's remarkable career has elevated her to celebrity status in @entity38 , where she was named @entity87 , graced the cover of @entity89 , and launched a best - selling biography			1
and when she hits @entity92 on saturday , there 's no doubt the nation will be cheering her on to what bookmakers are tipping will be her 25th consecutive win			2
" they 've restructured the day so that the race runs after 5pm -- that way it will be shown on tv , " @entity42 said			0
" @entity12 is the feature of the day			2
but luckily she does n't know how much pressure is on her to win -- we 're the ones who feel it , not her			0
" the last time @entity12 raced in a clockwise direction was at @entity70 's @entity111 , winning by the narrowest of margins in a heart - stopping finish			1
it was later revealed she had muscle strain in her legs which would put her out of action for eight months			0
@entity70 , like @entity38 , holds races in both directions , while the @entity123 opts for counter-clockwise competitions			0
@entity42 did n't rule out another trip to @entity69 for the magnificent mare , saying plans for future races would depend on her performance on saturday			1
beyond the track , @entity12 may also have a profitable career as a breeding mare , with @entity42 hinting champion @entity70 thoroughbred , @entity131 , could be a good match			1
@entity131 , who wrapped up his stellar career in the @entity138 at @entity69 with an unblemished 14 - win record , has now been put out to stud -- with big returns expected for owner @entity143 prince @entity142			2
" @entity131 is definitely in the mix , " @entity42 said			0
" he 's an extraordinary horse and it could be a wonderful match -- but nothing 's been decided and it 's something we 're still assessing			0

can @entity11 race horse @entity12 extend unblemished winning streak to 25 ?
will race in @entity17 's @entity154 this saturday , in clockwise direction
will be only the fourth time @entity25 mare has run in clockwise direction
future career depends on performance , owners *contemplate* @entity70 's @entity69
