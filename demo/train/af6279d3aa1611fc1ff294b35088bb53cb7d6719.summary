@entity0 , the man the @entity1 accuses of being the ringleader in the deadly 2012 attack on the @entity1 diplomatic mission in @entity5 , @entity6 , pleaded not guilty saturday during a brief appearance in federal court in @entity9			1
@entity0 , with long graying hair and a beard , spoke quietly in @entity12 with a translator as he was charged with one count of providing material support to terrorists			1
a federal grand jury returned a single - count indictment thursday in connection with attacks that killed four @entity1 , including @entity1 ambassador to @entity6 @entity22			1
standing before @entity1 magistrate judge @entity23 , @entity0 appeared subdued and briefly looked around the nearly full courtroom			2
wearing a dark gray hooded track suit and sandals , the defendant addressed the court only once to say his name in a barely audible voice			0
@entity0 was appointed a public defender , @entity31 , who entered a not guilty plea			2
he was ordered to remain in custody until hearings set for july 2 and july 8			0
" now that @entity36 has arrived in the @entity1 , he will face the full weight of our justice system , " @entity1 attorney general @entity35 said			2
" we will prove , beyond a reasonable doubt , the defendant 's alleged role in the attack that killed four brave @entity1 in @entity5			2
" @entity0 was indicted by a federal grand jury on a charge of " conspiracy to provide material support and resources to terrorists , knowing and intending that these would be used in preparation for and in carrying out a killing in the course of an attack on a federal facility , and the offense resulted in death , " according to @entity35 's statement			1
the single count is part of a legal strategy by federal prosecutors , who plan to file additional charges later , according to @entity1 officials			0
the aim is to delay releasing to the public and @entity0 's lawyer the @entity68 affidavit detailing the evidence the government has against him			1
the investigation is ongoing and the @entity73 can bring additional charges , the statement said			0
an earlier criminal complaint in july 2013 said the @entity68 believed it had evidence to charge him with murder and firing a weapon at the scene of the @entity5 attacks			1
those additional charges , if formally added , could bring the death penalty			0
in his court appearance , @entity0 , a @entity6 national who the government said is about 43 , requested consular assistance from the @entity6 government			1
@entity1 authorities were working with @entity6 embassy officials in @entity9 to provide him the assistance			0
he had been interrogated aboard the @entity89 after being captured earlier this month			1
though he was interrogated both before and after he had been advised of his @entity92 rights , he provided information to interrogators after being advised of those rights , a @entity1 official told @entity96			0
on saturday , he was flown by helicopter from the ship , an amphibious transport dock , to the nation 's capital and driven to the federal courthouse			0
after the hearing , @entity0 was taken away under armed guard from the federal courthouse in downtown @entity9 , a few blocks from the @entity107 and near the @entity108			1
he was then moved to the detention center in @entity110 , @entity111 , which is across the @entity112 from the capital			1
authorities say @entity0 is among the senior leaders of @entity116 , whose members were among several militias that participated in the attacks on @entity1 government facilities in @entity5 on september 11 - 12 , 2012			1
the attacks spawned a political controversy in the @entity1 because some @entity124 lawmakers claim the @entity126 administration tried to mislead the public about them and should have done more to prevent them			0
the @entity124 critics say they plan to make @entity5 an issue for former secretary of state @entity130 , under whose watch the attacks occurred , should she decide to run for president			2
the criminal investigation led by the @entity68 has been extraordinarily challenging , authorities say , in part because lack of @entity6 government control in the city prevented investigators from visiting the crime scene for weeks			1
@entity1 officials , however , say they collected surveillance video , phone eavesdropping and witness statements to bring charges against @entity0 and others involved			0
they are charged in a criminal complaint in federal court in @entity9			1
@entity0 became the face of the militant attack , and a top target for the @entity1 , after he cultivated a celebrity profile in the wake of the attacks , meeting with journalists and granting interviews			2
he denied to @entity96 's @entity157 that he participated in the attacks			0
@entity1 military commandos captured @entity0 in a nighttime raid june 15 - 16			2
@entity1 intelligence assets concocted a ruse to lure him to a villa where the @entity1 surprised him			0
the commandos , accompanied by several @entity68 agents , came ashore by boat and quickly took him away			0
he remained on the @entity89 , undergoing questioning by a team from the @entity68 - led @entity169 , until he was taken to court on saturday			1
