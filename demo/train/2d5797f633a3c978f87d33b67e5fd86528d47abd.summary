it 's an internet feud between polar opposites : @entity8 vs. @entity9 , old school vs. new media , @entity4 gravitas vs. @entity5 geekery			0
in one corner is @entity11			1
in the other , @entity12			2
at stake is the credibility of @entity11 's research and -- gasp ! -- the future viability of @entity18 's network			1
or , at least , the hearts and minds of the thousands of observers taking sides on social media			1
it all started last week when a group of @entity11 researchers published a paper that suggested @entity12 could lose a whopping 80 % of its users by 2017			1
they based their projection on epidemiological models , typically used to chart the spread of disease , using the demise of @entity35 as a case study			0
data " suggests that @entity12 has already reached the peak of its popularity and has entered a decline phase , " the researchers wrote in the paper , which has not been peer - reviewed			2
recent research has suggested , and @entity12 has admitted , that younger users are abandoning @entity12 for other social platforms			1
even so , many observers were skeptical of @entity11 's methodology			2
" it 's an old journalistic trick : just add the words ' research ' or ' study ' to a sensational claim for instant credibility , " wrote @entity49 's @entity48 , who criticized news outlets for reporting uncritically on the paper			2
" @entity58 , you 're absolved of any responsibility for verifying its truth , since everyone knows journalists are n't qualified to dispute scientific findings			0
" on thursday , @entity12 fired back			2
but instead of a canned statement or a point - by - point renunciation of the researchers ' methods , they took a more playful tack			0
" using the same robust methodology featured in the paper , we attempted to find out more about this ' @entity11 ' -- and you wo n't believe what we found ! " @entity12 data scientist @entity75 wrote in a blog post on his page			1
an examination of @entity12 and @entity81 patterns spells bad news ahead for the university , @entity75 said , tongue firmly planted in a sarcastic cheek			0
" this trend suggests that @entity11 will have only half its current enrollment by 2018 , and by 2021 it will have no students at all , agreeing with the previous graph of scholarly scholarliness			1
based on our robust scientific analysis , future generations will only be able to imagine this now - rubble institution that once walked this earth , " he added			0
" although this research has not yet been peer - reviewed , every @entity97 for this post counts as a peer review			0
start reviewing ! " by friday afternoon his post had attracted more than 8,100 likes and comments such as " well played ! " " you come at the king of social media , you best not miss , " wrote @entity105 on @entity106			1
@entity110 called it " the comeback of all comebacks			0
" the smackdown also spilled over to @entity115 , where the @entity116 called it a " nerd brawl " and most observers gave credit to @entity12 for having a sense of humor			0
a @entity11 spokesman did not immediately respond friday to @entity125 's request for comment			0
in reality , neither institution is in danger of wasting away any time soon			0
@entity11 received 24,498 applicants for its current freshman class and accepted only 7.4 % of them , reaffirming its status as one of the nation 's elite universities			1
and as of september 2013 @entity12 had 1.2 billion monthly active users .			1

@entity12 pokes fun at @entity11 over *controversial* social media study
@entity11 study suggested @entity12 could lose 80 % of its users by 2017
@entity12 : research shows @entity11 will run out of students by 2021
observer : " you come at the king of social media , you best not miss "
