-- @entity1 is regarded by many as the world 's greatest living animator and an icon of @entity7 popular culture			1
in 2002 , his work burst onto international screens with the ghostly animation " @entity11			1
" it smashed box office records in @entity7 and earned him an @entity15			0
setting up @entity17 in 1985 , the 70 - year - old has made 18 animated features that fuse wild fantasy with more serious issues including environmentalism and feminism			1
@entity1 's 2008 film " @entity31 " featured a catastrophic tsunami , but the animator insists that including disasters in his films only makes him a realist able to highlight the fragility of life rather than a prophetic , doom - monger			1
" i ca n't predict things , but i knew that a tsunami was coming because if you live in @entity7 that 's to be expected , " he said			0
" we just forgot that at some point a tsunami will come			0
even in the disaster stricken areas , people should have known , or even if they knew they probably felt that they were protected by the concrete around them			0
" @entity1 visited the tsunami - hit area of northeast @entity7 four months after the disaster to screen his films to local children			1
surveying the devastation around the town of @entity49 , he said : " the people who are going to live here should take the time and really think about what kind of town should be rebuilt			2
" his own attention to detail and pain - staking approach to making his films has gained him plaudits from contemporaries like @entity61 's @entity60 and " @entity63 " animator @entity62			2
but he does believe that his @entity17 is one of a dying breed ; a place where animators draw by hand and use computer animation sparingly			1
" we are an extinct species maybe , an island of the @entity73 , and well , ( hand drawing ) is the only thing i 'm interested in and therefore people who are not interested in working by hand should choose another place of work			2
" while aware of the need to creating a functioning business with @entity17 , @entity1 remains protective of his films -- " all my films are all my children " -- especially when shown to international audiences			1
he once sent a samurai sword to @entity87 who was handling the release of " @entity89 " with a note attached reading : " no cuts			0
" " sometimes we have to create animation to support the studio , not have the studio to support the animation , " he said			0
" but we ca n't really have that approach so we have to change our mindset and say that we want to make this animation			0
" just as long as there are people , there is an audience for the films we make , that is enough			0

@entity105 created @entity17 with business partner in 1985
*director* and animator created international hits like " @entity31 " and " @entity11 "
@entity1 is one of the last of his kind , *relying* almost totally on drawing by hand
