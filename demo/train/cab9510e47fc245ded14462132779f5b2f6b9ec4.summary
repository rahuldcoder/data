marching , dancing and poster - waving environmentalists chanting " hey , @entity3			1
we do n't want no climate drama , " packed several blocks on and around @entity6 's @entity5 on sunday , hoping to spur president @entity3 to take strong measures against climate change			1
@entity10 , 16 , brandished a sign reading " @entity12 " as she attended her first political demonstration			2
" someday , i hope to have my own kids , and i want them to live in a world that 's environmentally safe and natural , " @entity10 said , explaining why she , her mother and her boyfriend had traveled more than 500 miles from @entity16 , @entity17			2
" this is the kind of thing worth leaving home to come out and take a stand for , " she said			2
throngs at the " @entity27 " rally spent several hours marching from the @entity28 to the @entity29 , then back to the @entity5			1
those who arrived early , and those who did n't let the cold dissuade them from returning to the @entity5 , heard speakers call on the president to reject the @entity36 pipeline and to tell the @entity37 to set carbon standards for power plants			1
during @entity3 's @entity42 speech on tuesday , the president urged @entity43 to do more to combat climate change			1
" we can choose to believe that @entity46 , and the most severe drought in decades , and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence			2
or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science and act before it 's too late , " the president said			1
" i urge this @entity43 to pursue a bipartisan , market - based solution to climate change , like the one @entity58 and @entity59 worked on together a few years ago			1
but if @entity43 wo n't act soon to protect future generations , i will			2
" some activists have been urging @entity3 to bypass the often messy legislative process and instead focus on executive orders and regulations from the @entity37			1
" @entity43 is a place where good ideas go to die , " @entity65 , legislative director for the environmental group the @entity66 , said last month			1
" there is a tremendous amount that his administration can do without @entity43			2
he does n't have to wait for @entity43			0
" long - term climate change fueled by a buildup of atmospheric carbon emissions is a controversial notion politically , but it 's one accepted as fact by most scientists			1
atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide , which traps heat , have gone up sharply in recent decades , while global average temperatures are up about 1.5 degrees f since records started being kept in the late 19th century , according to @entity87			0
the @entity88 , the 1997 pact aimed at reining in carbon emissions , aimed to limit that increase to 3.6 degrees @entity85 ( 2 degrees c ) by 2100 -- but a november report by the @entity92 warned that trends point more toward an increase twice that big by the end of the century			0
the 1,700 - mile @entity36 pipeline project -- which would extend current oil pipeline networks from @entity98 , @entity100 's bitumen - filled ground , all the way across the @entity102 to the @entity103 -- exposed partisan and regional divisions within @entity43 during @entity3 's first term			1
@entity106 , otherwise known as tar sand , is oil - soaked dirt that needs to be cooked to extract the oil			0
a @entity112 report released in june said oil produced from bitumen emits 14 % to 20 % more greenhouse gases -- the gases that can cause atmospheric hearting -- than the average transportation fuels sold or distributed in the @entity102			0
the @entity98 government website says the province is the first jurisdiction to set mandatory reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions			1
however , it says while average emissions per oil barrel are declining , since the demand for oil production has increased , overall emissions have increased as well			0
at sunday 's rally , @entity130 of the @entity131 verbalized a common theme			1
" @entity36 is a dirty and dangerous pipeline			1
it 's literally going to cut our country in half , carrying a very dangerous fuel , and it will cause runaway climate change , " @entity130 said			1
" young people across the country are the same generation that elected @entity3 twice now , and we really want to see him reject the @entity36			1
" the @entity3 administration rejected the initial proposal from the @entity100 energy company @entity145 , saying it needed more time to gauge the potential environmental impact of the project			1
while that decision pleased environmentalists , pipeline supporters argued that the postponement cost @entity102 jobs and a degree of energy independence			1
the @entity29 has probably already decided against ever approving @entity36 , despite the pipeline 's many supporters , said @entity157 , the director of the @entity158 at the libertarian think tank the @entity159			1
" the political calculus is obvious			0
if they come out against it , they are going to pay a very big price , " @entity157 said sunday			1
" it 's very popular around the country : the notion that you are going to be pumping more oil through this country , that there will be some jobs that will be established to put the pipeline in			2
there will be some jobs for maintenance , and , you know , if you want to talk about the internationalization , if you will , of oil supply , @entity100 is our biggest supplier and they 're friendly			0
what 's not to like ? " environmentalists say there 's plenty not to like			0
of greatest concern initially , the @entity36 pipeline was designed to run through @entity188 's @entity187 , which lie above the @entity189 , the main source of drinking water and irrigation for millions of people			1
now , even though refined plans show an alternate route , environmentalists worry that if the expected 500,000 to 700,000 barrels of crude oil flow through the pipeline each day , leaks could contaminate the water and soil			2
@entity157 said those fears are unfounded , and " climate change is becoming the last refuge of regulatory scoundrels			2
" " it reminds me of the @entity145 pipeline that was supposed to cause all these problems and wreak all this havoc			2
all it did was supply oil , " @entity157 said			0
he posited that @entity102 emissions from the energy sector are at their lowest level since 1992 , despite -- not thanks to -- government intervention			1
" that did n't happen because of subsidizing solar energy and windmills			0
there 's just not a lot , not enough electricity coming from those minuscule rays			0
it happened because of natural gas , hydrofracturizing and horizontal drilling , which has increased the supply dramatically , " he said			0
the @entity230 has taken credit for laying the groundwork for the current natural gas boom , citing research and development dating back to the 1970s that led to today 's hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , techniques of extracting gas from shale			0
the @entity242 says increased use of natural gas has come at the expense of coal , which tends to emit significantly more carbon dioxide than natural gas			0
" it was n't because people wanted to save the planet			0
it 's because they wanted to make money			0
@entity254 , that 's how to make people efficient			0
do n't fetter the economy and you 'll find out that people want to produce , either want to produce things efficiently or produce efficient things			0
they are advantaged in the marketplace			0
get the government out of it and you 'll get a greener planet , " @entity157 said			2
but the crowds that braved temperatures in the low 30s and winds exceeding 20 mph to make their point heard in @entity6 could n't disagree more			1
" climate change is established science			2
and it 's time we get our act together and find a better way is renewable energy , " said @entity274 , @entity10 's mother			0
" if they put a minuscule amount of the money into research and development for renewable energy that they spend on fossil fuels , we 'd be there now			0
you know , it 's not because it ca n't be done			0
it 's because of the political and financial powers that be that have a vested interest in keeping the system that we have now			0
and it 's not working			0
" the @entity66 , the anti-climate change consortium @entity299 , and the civil rights organization the @entity301 put together the rally .			1

the @entity5 in @entity6 was packed with anti-climate change *protesters* sunday
demonstrators were *lobbying* for president @entity3 to step up against environmental *threats*
the proposed @entity36 from @entity98 to the @entity103 is a major topic of *conflict*
pipeline backers say government intervention is a bad idea , both *pragmatically* and politically
