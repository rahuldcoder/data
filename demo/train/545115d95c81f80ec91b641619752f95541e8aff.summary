@entity0 , @entity1 -- oil from the @entity6 spill may have settled to the bottom of the @entity8 further east than previously suspected and at levels toxic to marine life , researchers reported monday			1
initial findings from a new survey of the @entity8 conclude that dispersants may have sent the oil to the ocean floor , where it has turned up at the bottom of an undersea canyon within 40 miles of the @entity19			1
plankton and other organisms showed a " strong toxic response " to the crude , according to researchers from the @entity1			1
" the dispersant is moving the oil down out of the surface and into the deeper waters , where it can affect phytoplankton and other marine life , " said @entity25 , a marine microbiologist at @entity1			1
results of the latest survey are scheduled to be released tuesday , but @entity2 obtained a summary of the initial conclusions monday night			1
tests conducted offshore indicate the oil matches the 205 - million - gallon @entity6 spill , which has been temporarily capped for a month , the summary states			2
some of it has spread into the @entity42 , a channel on the ocean floor east of the ruptured well			0
that canyon comprises part of the spawning grounds for much of the @entity8 's commercial fish			1
" to date , this is the easternmost location for the occurrence of subsurface oils , " the report states			0
the oil is not " draping " across the bottom , but is spread out in " small , unevenly distributed droplets , " the report states			2
@entity1 chemical oceanographer @entity57 said that when an ultraviolet light used to detect oil was turned onto the sea floor , " all of a sudden , it turns out to be a constellation of little dots			1
" and the oil could well up onto the continental shelf and resurface later , @entity25 said			1
or it could be eaten by fish and other animals and accumulate in the food chain , @entity57 said			0
" it 's in such small droplets that you can see it -- you can filter it and see it , " he said			0
" but if you look at it , it 's transparent , and small larval fish see these droplets as food so they 're ingesting pure oil			2
" the @entity82 has previously reported some oil turning up in the sediment at the bottom of the @entity8 , but has not determined whether it came from the @entity6 spill that erupted in april or whether it was already present			1
and on august 4 , the head of the @entity88 warned that oil could persist in the water even though the well has been temporarily capped			2
the oil company @entity92 used more than 1.8 million gallons of chemical dispersants on the @entity6 spill between its eruption in late april and the time the well was capped in @entity97			2
@entity92 says the chemicals allowed the oil to be broken up into droplets small enough that microbes can digest it , and the @entity82 has said the dispersants were no more toxic than the oil itself			1
critics warned the full effect of the dispersants on the food chain was not known and that their use in deep water effectively concealed the full extent of the spill			0
@entity88 spokeswoman @entity114 said on monday that she had not seen the latest study and could n't comment on it			0
@entity92 spokesman @entity117 , meanwhile , said the company wants " to know everything everyone wants to know			0
" the company is responsible for capping , cleaning up and compensating victims of the oil spill , and it has committed to spending $ 500 million to research the spill 's impact over the next 10 years			2
the latest study will " add another piece to the puzzle , " @entity117 said			0
" there will be others that 'll want to look at this study and want to look at doing some additional research , " he said			0
" there 's been extensive testing up to this point , and i 'm sure there will be much more going forward			0
" @entity2 's @entity136 contributed to this report .			0
