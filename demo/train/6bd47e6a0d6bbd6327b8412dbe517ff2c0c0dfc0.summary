@entity0 -- @entity2 famously wrote about the wall of separation between church and state			0
he did n't mention separating church and politics , but everybody knows it 's a sticky wicket			2
on friday , @entity11 , a @entity12 minister , introduced @entity14 gov. @entity13 at at a gathering of social conservatives , calling @entity13 a genuine follower of @entity18 , as opposed to another candidate @entity11 could and did mention in a later interview			2
" i think @entity22 is a good , moral man , but i think those of us who are born - again followers of @entity18 should always prefer a competent @entity26 to a competent non-christian like @entity22 , " @entity11 told @entity1 's @entity21			1

" i believe in my @entity29 faith and i endeavor to live by it			1
some believe that such a confession of my faith will sink my candidacy			2
if they 're right , so be it			0
" asked about the controversy on @entity1 's " @entity49 " on sunday , @entity22 's @entity47 presidential rivals took a pass			1
" i 'm not running for theologian in chief , " businessman @entity51 said			0
" i 'm a lifelong @entity26 , and what that means is one of my guiding principles for the decisions i made is i start with , do the right thing			2
i 'm not getting into that controversy			0
" @entity62 rep. @entity61 called the issue " so inconsequential			0
" asked if she was concerned that people might think she was dodging the question , @entity61 said , " i think , again , to make this a big issue is just ridiculous right now , because every day i 'm on the street talking to people			0
this is not what people are talking about			0
" asked the same question , @entity51 had a similar answer			0
" if that 's what it looks like , i 'm dodging it , because it 's not going to help us boost this economy , and you know that that 's my no. 1 priority , " he said			2
many things sank @entity22 's candidacy in 2008			1
religion may have been one of them			0
explain it to me : mormonism @entity90 , editorial director of the @entity91 , points out that @entity22 ran poorly among evangelical @entity26 , especially in the @entity92 , in 2008			1
" in all the @entity92 , he never topped out above 20 % of the votes among evangelical @entity26 ; only 11 % in the critical state of @entity95 , " @entity90 said			1
in all , 45 % of @entity47 who vote in primaries are conservative evangelical christians			1
they are far less a factor in a general election			0
for @entity22 's rivals , this requires straddling a line -- you do n't want to alienate a huge part of the primary vote , nor do you want to look intolerant .			1

@entity47 presidential *hopeful* @entity22 's @entity29 faith is once again under the *microscope*
