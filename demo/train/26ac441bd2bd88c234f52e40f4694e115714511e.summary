@entity0 -- what 's the most emotional and divisive issue in @entity5 politics ? abortion , right ? just this weekend , former @entity8 front - runner @entity7 used the abortion issue to slam current @entity8 front - runner @entity10 at the @entity12 and @entity13 forum			1
@entity7 said : " it is a liberal canard to say i am personally pro-life , but government should stay out of that decision			0
if that is your view , you are not pro-life , you are pro having - your - cake - and - eating - it - too			0
" over the previous week , @entity10 had alarmed anti-abortion voters with a series of verbal miscues , indicating both that abortion must be stopped but also that the decision should be left to the individual woman , with no role for government			1
at the @entity12 and @entity13 forum , @entity10 over-corrected for his week of stumbles : " no abortions			1
" that new position goes far beyond the usual pro-life policy , which allows exceptions for rape , child abuse , and to save the life of the mother			0
pro-life activists must unhappily confront the probability that many of the leading candidates for the @entity8 nomination in 2012 - while all professedly pro-life - in reality neither care very much nor think very much about the abortion issue			1
but now look at the world from the politicians ' point of view			0
they must hold together a coalition that is sliced apart by the abortion issue			1
pro-choice republicans do not hold forums			0
but they exist , and they have power			0
with the result that while you ca n't get nominated for president by the @entity8 if you are pro-choice ( see @entity60 , @entity61 ) , you also ca n't get nominated if you oppose abortion too much ( see @entity63 , @entity64 )			2
for the politicians , it 's all baffling and vexing			2
and yet -- incredible as it sounds now -- there is reason to expect that the abortion issue may someday just vanish from national politics			1
after all , that 's what happened to the last great moral issue to rattle the @entity76 system : alcohol prohibition			1
for 70 years from the end of the @entity79 to the @entity80 , a human lifetime , the " drys " and the " wets " mustered all the passion , commitment , and moralism of the pro-life and pro-choice movements of our day			0
" it is my opinion that the saloonkeeper is worse than a thief and a murderer			0
the ordinary thief steals only your money , but the saloonkeeper steals your honor and your character			0
the ordinary murderer takes your life , but the saloonkeeper murders your soul			0
" that 's from the famous " booze sermon " of @entity107 , the great popular preacher of the 1910s and 1920s			2
thousands of such passionate speeches -- millions more passionate words -- were uttered by names now brown with history : @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115			0
it was not all talk			0
ferocious legislative battles were bought to prohibit alcohol at the county , state and then ultimately national level			2
the great scholar of @entity5 politics , @entity125 , estimated to her graduate students that through the long run of @entity5 history , more elections at more levels of government have turned on alcohol than any other issue , including slavery			1
politicians hated the alcohol issue for the same reason they now dislike the abortion issue : it sliced apart the existing party structure			1
the @entity8 could not win a national majority without the support of @entity145 immigrants from @entity146 in cities like @entity148 and @entity149			0
the @entity150 could not win without the enthusiastic support of @entity152 in @entity153 and @entity154			0
city - dwelling @entity146 and @entity152 intensely resented attempts of their country - dwelling neighbors to regulate their behavior for them			2
" if they do n't feel like takin ' a glass of beer on sunday , we must abstain , " a contemporary @entity161 - @entity5 politician bitterly complained			1
" if they have not got any amusements up in their backwoods , we must n't have none			0
" national politicians responded to @entity171 then in the same way they respond to abortion now : by looking for ways to avoid and de-escalate a destabilizing issue			1
" questions based upon temperance , religion , morality , in all their multiplied forms , ought not to be the basis of politics , " declared senator @entity176 of @entity177 in 1873			2
" we do n't want to alienate anybody ! " complained a @entity186 @entity8 leader of the 1880s as quoted in a contemporary newspaper			0
as @entity192 observes in his classic history , " the @entity194 " , " very few prominent @entity8 politicians were abstainers ... the politicians were not less likely to be churchgoers ( many voters , after all , attended church ) , but they had developed their own standards of personal morality			0
" then as now ! and yet a century later ... the issue is dead			2
what happened ? three things			0
alcohol prohibition did finally get a national trial , from 1919 - 1933 and was universally experienced even by former supporters as a disaster			2
the problem addressed by prohibition has dwindled away			0
while it 's difficult to know with any precision how much people drank in the years after the @entity79 , it 's almost certain that 19th century @entity5 drank much more than they do today			1
( for that matter , @entity5 today drink nearly 20 % less than they did as recently as 1980			1
and maybe most important , drinking and non-drinking are no longer so intimately associated with other ethno - cultural divisions within @entity5 life			1
as alcohol ceased to be a cultural symbol , the appropriate regulation of alcohol ceased to be an ideological issue			1
when alcohol regulation flared up again in the 1980s , during the debate over stricter punishments for drunk driving , the debate never turned into a culture war because " alcohol " was not code ( as it had been a century before ) for a dozen other identities and grievances			1
can we imagine such a fate for the abortion issue ? condition number one could well happen , and would be revolutionary			1
but even in its absence , condition number two is beginning to obtain in the @entity5			1
in the early 1980s , there were some 29 abortions per 1,000 women of child - bearing age			0
today that rate has declined to about 19 abortions per 1,000 women			0
the rate will never reach zero , but we may expect that it will continue to decline as contraceptives improve and attitudes to out - of - wedlock birth become more accepting , and as younger generations increasingly reject abortion as an acceptable resolution of a pregnancy			1
what about condition three ? alcohol became central to @entity5 politics at a time when @entity5 were arguing whether the country should be rural or urban , a farm economy or industrial , and whether @entity261 could ever become good @entity5			1
as those arguments lost their intensity , so did the alcohol issue			1
abortion became central to modern politics at exactly the same time as @entity5 were arguing over sexuality generally , over the status of women and the rights of gays			1
i think it 's a good guess that if we come to a new consensus about the status of women -- absorbing and digesting the sexual revolution of the 1960s and the feminist revolution of the 1970s into a new dispensation more comfortable with both women 's equality to men and their differences from men -- disagreements over abortion will come to matter less			2
such disagreements wo n't disappear , any more than we 've seen the end of debates about whether bars should open on sundays			0
but the disagreements wo n't matter so furiously much as they now seem to do			0
too bad for @entity10 that day still seems at least a couple of decades remote			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity294 .			2

@entity10 's comments on abortion brought him heavy *criticism*
@entity294 says abortion may be the *hottest* social issue , but it may not always be so
he says @entity5 politics was riven by debate over alcohol for generations
*changing* social views and behavior may greatly lessen abortion issue , he says
