@entity1 , @entity0 -- the designers behind a " thinking " yacht are hoping to break a world record by sending it across the @entity7 without any human assistance			1
the autonomous yacht @entity10 is hoisted to have her keel put in place before launching the four - meter boat , " @entity10 " , was designed and built by an eight - strong team of third - year engineering students at @entity17 science university @entity16			1
the students are planning to take the boat to a robotic sailing regatta in july , before launching it into the @entity23 challenge in early september			1
using sensors to detect the speed and direction of the wind , the boat is programmed to reach a given co-ordinate and will attain it by automatically adapting to the changing conditions			1
one of the " @entity31 " ( @entity31 ) team 's project managers , @entity34 , told @entity2 that if the @entity7 crossing succeeds it will be a world record as an unmanned boat has not previously made the voyage			1
it is planned the crossing will begin from the west coast of @entity41 and finish in the @entity42			2
" for us the @entity23 challenge is the big goal			2
i 'm pretty confident we can do it			2
this week in testing it is pretty much doing what it 's supposed to do			0
and it is water tight			0
" over the last couple of days we tried some autonomous tacks and jibes and now we are testing the navigation , " he said			0
see photos of the autonomous yacht from construction to launch Â» the team has been working on the project since september 2008 , and are currently at the on - water testing stage , having designed and built the boat			1
while the team will be able to track the boat through an onboard global positioning system ( gps ) during the transatlantic voyage , @entity34 said as long as the challenge is active they wo n't have any control over the vessel			2
" we will set it out and it will be completely autonomous			0
there are solar cells on the back for power and extra power supplies on board			0
" there is a satellite communication system on board and the boat can download weather information by itself so it can calculate the best route to travel , " he said			2
@entity34 said the team is positive that the carbon - fibre boat will survive the rough @entity7 seas -- an issue that has stopped many manned crossings before -- including @entity95 's attempt at the fastest transatlantic crossing aboard the 99 - foot @entity97 last fall			1
" we feel our advantage over other teams is that we are mechanical engineers			0
we have designed this boat ourselves and exactly for this purpose			1
" @entity34 said the idea could one day offer a new autopilot option for large yachts			0
" the idea came as there are autopilots for boats out there , but currently the commercially available autopilots only steer the rudder			0
we are looking to control the sails as well			0

university students at @entity16 have designed and built a robotic boat
the boat needs no sailors and uses sensors to sail in changing conditions
it is hoped the yacht will sail autonomously across the @entity7
if it succeeds it would be the first @entity7 crossing by an unmanned boat
