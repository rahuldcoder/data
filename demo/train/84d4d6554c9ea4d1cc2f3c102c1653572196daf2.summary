@entity0 -- @entity2 drives the streets of the @entity0 six days a week -- the 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. shift			1
he never imagined he 'd be a cabdriver at his age			2
after all , a decade ago , he was pulling down $ 250,000 a year on @entity7			1
he survived the 9/11 attacks while working in wealth management for @entity10 on the 73rd floor of the @entity13 's @entity12			1
he was a lucky man			2
but @entity2 lost his last finance job in 2009 , not so long after the markets crashed during the @entity16			1
he is still in its grasp , trying to raise two kids , his hair now gray , driving a yellow taxi through the steel and concrete caverns of @entity24			2
" i got caught in - between and things got tough , " he says simply			2
" @entity26 would have thought that i could do this , but being a @entity28 , i knew the streets			2
i learned the streets a lot better when i had to start paying attention to them			2
" there 's a rhythm to driving a cab -- " a bit of science to this game , " as @entity2 says			1
" in the morning , you do n't want to be caught on the @entity40 too early			2
they do n't wake up ' til 7:30			0
but down on @entity43 , they 're younger , more aggressive			0
they 're going to work at @entity45 and @entity46 or wherever , and you take ' em. " then a note of sadness comes to his voice , a slight softening			0
" a lot of them do n't even remember 9/11 , you know			0
the younger guys , it does n't mean much to ' em. " it means a lot to @entity2			1
he 'd worked his way from @entity63 , @entity64 , to @entity65 in @entity66 to a job on @entity7			1
on that blue sky tuesday morning , when the first plane hit the @entity69 at 8:46 a.m. , @entity2 remembers one guy in his office who 'd lived through the 1993 bombing of the towers running out of his office hollering			1
" he moved so fast , he caught the last @entity78 train to @entity79			0
he probably saw the second plane get hit from the @entity79 side , " he says with a half - laugh			0
" but to give you a juxtaposition , another guy who was also there in ' 93 had a gas mask in his desk drawer			0
he put it on and never left			0
" in the chaos , @entity2 started to take the stairs down and then curiosity got the better of him			1
he stopped around the 56th floor and gathered with others in an office with windows facing the @entity69			0
" that 's when you see the burning building , the smoke , the debris , the people falling , and people yelling ' my @entity104 , my @entity104			1
' " he tried to call his wife , who was pregnant and at home that day , but it just went to voicemail			0
then the second plane hit			0
it was like a crashing chandelier , " he remembers			0
" it was above me , like crashing glass , but the impact was so strong it felt like it was underneath my feet			0
so i just knew i could n't stay where i was			0
i got back out to the stairwell , and this time i started to make my way down a little bit faster , 50 , 40 , 30			1
" his family thought he was still on the 73rd floor , near the impact zone			0
" they were actually taking a tape measure to the tv to try and figure out where the plane hit			0
they did n't think there was enough time			0
" there was enough time , then			0
but the post- 9/11 economy eventually led to layoffs and @entity2 bounced around -- trading commodities and working for a family firm that hedged precious metals			1
for a while , he was commuting to @entity139 , @entity140 , for work , but cutbacks caused him to be an expensive option easily shed			0
and so began a year of unemployment , taking care of his kids at their rent - stabilized apartment off @entity148			1
it was the worst time to be looking for a job , and @entity2 found himself caught in a @entity151 : too senior to be a quick hire , too junior to have a golden parachute			1
" guys like me can be replaced at a much cheaper rate , " @entity2 says			1
" you know , a guy who 's well into the six figure category , making 250 plus , he 's easily replaceable by a guy who they can get for a hundred grand who thinks it 's the best job in the world			1
or they can replace me with two young guys			0
" after months sending out resumes with no response , @entity2 started driving a cab to make ends meet			1
more than a year later , he started to put his resume in the back of the taxi for riders to read			1
he thinks of it as fishing : " if you 've ever been fishing , you know you can spend a whole day on a pond and never catch a fish			0
but if you know the lay of the land , your odds improve			1
" over time , he 's gotten some help			2
a writer helped him tighten the resume , another suggested condensing it to one page and putting them in a basket			0
" it does keep my faith in humanity , " @entity2 says			1
" one thing you learn driving a cab is that it 's all connected			1
" he 's gotten some leads -- even a few interviews -- but nothing solid has come through , yet			2
" @entity204 just laid off 11,000			0
@entity205 laid off 10,000 worldwide , so i 'm still in a holding pattern , " @entity2 says			1
" i 've been in and out of markets for 25 years , and there 's always an excuse -- there 's an election coming up , or it 's the end of the year , wait ' til the budgets get finalized			1
... but as time passes , it gets more difficult			0
people look at you a little differently -- you 've been out two and half years now , it 's not one year -- that 's my only discouragement			1
" driving through @entity0 , almost anonymous now in the front seat , @entity2 sees deepening divides			1
" people who have a lot of money , they had their dip , but now they 're back			2
their bank account has been affected a bit , but their lives have n't			0
they cut back from four vacations a year to three			1
but if you 've been caught in that downward spiral , coming back is extremely difficult			2
" it 's a riff reminiscent of the fiscal cliff debates we 're hearing in @entity237 , reflecting the growing gap between the super-rich and the middle class			1
" we 're a tale of two cities now , " @entity2 says in a tone that 's equal parts resignation and frustration			1
but that does n't mean @entity2 is giving up -- far from it			1
" my @entity248 's resolution is to get out of the cab and back into a 9 to 5			1
it 's just a matter of closing a deal			2
... i also want to write a book			0
i could call it ' from street to street ' -- from @entity7 to having to work the street , so to speak			1
i think it would be a story of survival -- understanding that you can have everything at times and sometimes when things get tough , you 're forced to take other routes			0
but there is light at the end of the tunnel			0
and if you stay focused you can get through anything			0
" it 's not easy , but at 49 , @entity2 remains determined , at turns realistic and optimistic			1
" i 've been driving a taxi almost half my daughter 's life - she 's 6			2
i felt really bad about that idea , " he says			0
" but every now and then , she 'll whisper in my ear and say : ' @entity277 , i wish for you that you 'd get a new job and i 'm proud of you			2
' she actually used those words , ' i 'm proud of you			0
' so i 'm stuck driving a cab right now			2
i never thought it would happen			0
but i still believe it 's all gon na work out -- things do get better			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity288 .			0

@entity2 once made $ 250,000 a year on @entity7 ; now he drives a cab
@entity2 keeps his resumes in the back seat , *hoping* it will help him land a job
with @entity7 *companies* still cutting jobs , it 's not easy to get back into finance
he sees a deepening divide between the super-rich and the middle class
