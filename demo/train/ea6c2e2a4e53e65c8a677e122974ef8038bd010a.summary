@entity1 , @entity0 -- a record crowd in @entity1 's @entity4 swelled tuesday afternoon , a sea of @entity0 from every walk of life in a demonstration dubbed the " march of millions			1
" tens of thousands prayed on their knees on the asphalt in unison under the sprawling city 's winter sun , and then chanted " leave , leave " in a deafening roar to their president , @entity18			1
as the throngs congregated , @entity0 's @entity19 showed live pictures of car traffic crossing a bridge over the @entity24 , with bulletins announcing that a curfew would be imposed again on tuesday starting at 3 p.m. soldiers and plain - clothed security officers searched demonstrators and controlled access to @entity4 , or @entity31 , which has been the focal point of protests against @entity0 's embattled @entity18 , 82			1
after the first lines of security , scores of self - appointed volunteers from the protest movement conducted their own searches of bags , and ordered arriving people to show their identity cards as they streamed in			2
one man handed out leaflets , urging demonstrators to behave in front of foreign journalists covering the event			2
" as you know all media organizations are here to follow your efforts , " the leaflet read , " in order to show @entity0 in a positive light , we insist that you follow a peaceful approach in expressing your requests and ideas			2
" men and women continued a practice that has sprung up here over the last week ... standing alone in the street , holding up hand - made signs , and posing proudly for the cell phone photos of passers - by			2
" @entity18 has been here since @entity71 , " shouted one man , who held up a sign that said " @entity68 " in @entity69			1
@entity72 , 23 , said he and his father and brother traveled two hours on five different buses from their village outside @entity1 to attend the demonstration			1
" i 'd like to see change in my country , " @entity72 said , as he walked slowly with hordes of people through security checkpoints towards the square			2
" i 'd like to see a president in @entity0 every eight years like in other countries			2
... this is just the country of rich people			0
i graduated from university and i speak four languages but i ca n't find a job because of nepotism and corruption			0
to do anything you have to pay money			0
" many @entity0 opposition parties have embraced today 's demonstration , which was promoted through fliers and leaflets , since the government has shut down almost all of the internet connections in the country			1
" today we are all together in @entity4 , " said @entity104 , a member of the opposition group @entity105 , which means " enough " in @entity69			1
" this revolution is a revolution of the young generation			0
we are just supporters , " @entity104 said			0
he claimed @entity0 's long repressed opposition parties were working together with one goal , to remove president @entity18			1
in another part of @entity1 , an aide to @entity112 said the former opposition candidate for president was holding talks with officials from the liberal secular opposition @entity118			1
" you can not call us @entity105 or @entity120 or leftists or anything , " @entity104 explained			0
" we talk today as @entity0			0
" but @entity104 also said his party opposed the announced goal of some demonstrators , who planned to march from @entity4 to the @entity126			1
" i send a message for all the demonstrators			0
do n't leave the square , " @entity104 said , in a telephone interview with @entity2			1
a march of tens of thousands of people , if not more , would put the protesters in tense confrontations with the @entity0 troops who have established checkpoints throughout the city			0
at the outskirts of @entity4 , army officers drove a truck blaring patriotic music from loudspeakers			1
on monday , the military announced it would not use force against the demonstrators			0
" the presence of the armed forces in the @entity0 streets is for your benefit to protect your safety and peace , " an unnamed military spokesman announced on state television monday night			0
" your armed forces will not use violence against this great people , who have always played a significant role in every moment of @entity0 's great history			0
" and deeper in the throngs of jubilant protesters , one of the men who searched arriving participants wore a camouflage military uniform underneath civilian pants and jacket in an apparent effort to blend in with the crowd .			0
