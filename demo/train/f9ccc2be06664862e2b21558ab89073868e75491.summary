-- @entity2 's pro-democracy demonstrators are but the latest freedom group to be abandoned by the @entity5 administration			1
the pattern was set in president @entity5 's first year in office , when he committed his initial major foreign policy error by refusing to support pro-democracy demonstrators in @entity10			1
and , although we did n't know it at the time , it was to be the administration 's original sin , an early predictor of things to come			0
indeed , time and again , this @entity19 has shown itself to be allergic to those peacefully seeking backing for their freedom causes			2
whether @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity10 or @entity30 , dissidents who regularly make the rounds of the halls of power in @entity27 privately complain that even when the @entity19 and the @entity32 receive them , the official is of low stature and the support is tepid			1
and so when tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of @entity2 last weekend , the administration ran true to form			0
our consulate there expressed support for general rights such as freedom of expression , religion and association , but was signally quiet on democracy			2
in fact , the consulate seemed to go out of its way to wash its hands of the demonstrations , saying : " we do not take sides in the discussion of @entity2 's political development , nor do we support any particular individuals or groups involved in it			2
... we encourage all sides to refrain from actions that would further escalate tensions , to exercise restraint and to express views on ( @entity2 's ) political development in a peaceful manner			0
" the protesters ' official @entity65 feed was quick to express bitter disappointment : " once again , democratic govs are not speaking up for democracy			2
here is @entity73 consulate 's mealy - mouthed statement			1
" why has the @entity5 administration been so slow to embrace freedom - seeking protesters ? three main reasons spring to mind : we 're not @entity78 : president @entity5 's aversion to his predecessor 's policies is clear not just in his snide condescension , but also in his actions			1
president @entity78 's embrace of what he called " the freedom agenda " appears to be enough to damn the whole project and for @entity5 to want to do the opposite			2
pretensions to realism : despite the fact that failures are piling up , the @entity5 administration apparently sees itself as really good at international relations			0
as such , it appears to be under the impression that it is pursuing cold - eyed national security interests and , as the " only adults in the room , " has no time for idealism			0
@entity100 is not the progressives ' thing : though it receives little attention , progressivism 's well - known preference for centralized control over what it sees as " unplanned chaos " must play a role			2
progressives mock " liberty " here at home , so why would they take to it overseas ? it is no coincidence that , very early on in her role as secretary of state , @entity116 elevated climate change and gender issues over freedom in her dealings with foreign officials			1
some of the @entity19 's most thoughtful defenders point out that it is counterproductive to support pro-democracy groups , whether in @entity128 or @entity2			1
but this ignores the fact that tyrants will do what they want to do , whether we support protesters or not -- the bloodily suppressed @entity10 protests back in 2009 underscore this point			1
what foreign liberty - seekers want from us is often not " boots on the ground , " much less " nation - building			1
" they desire moral validation of their cause , the knowledge that an outside power -- the world 's only superpower , no less -- stands by them and believes in their cause			1
the @entity154 dissident @entity153 , for example , has written vividly of what it meant to those in the @entity158 to hear that president @entity159 had called the @entity154 evil : " this was the moment			0
it was the brightest , most glorious day			0
finally a spade had been called a spade			0
finally , @entity166 's @entity165 was dead			0
... it was one of the most important , freedom - affirming declarations , and we all instantly knew it			0
" support for freedom overseas has been @entity73 's official policy at least since @entity174 announced his doctrine to @entity176 , saying that , with @entity177 exhausted and its empire fading , we had to step up			1
" one of the primary objectives of the foreign policy of the @entity73 , " @entity174 said , " is the creation of conditions in which we and other nations will be able to work out a way of life free from coercion			1
" but it goes back much earlier , and the founders understood we were to hold the torch of freedom for the rest of the world to see			0
when we do n't , it creates not just disappointment in places like @entity2 , but dissonance here at home .			0

@entity19 has shunned *people* protesting for freedom , argues @entity201
tyrants will do what they want to do , whether we support protesters or not , @entity201 says
what foreign liberty - seekers want from us is moral validation of their cause , he writes
support for freedom overseas has been @entity73 's official policy since @entity174 , he says
