-- when @entity3 set out in search of a weekend house 15 years ago , what she wanted was a place to see and be seenâ € ” by crickets , sparrows , coyotes , and frogs , as well as by a few dear friends			1
@entity0 : 14 one - of - a - kind fireplaces to @entity3 , already a rising star in the design world at the time , weekends were a chance to recharge her creative batteries			1
and for that , nothing worked as powerfully as time spent outdoors , which meant that a quiet corner of @entity23 , in @entity21 , was a better setting for her downtime than , say , the @entity27			1
@entity0 : 9 rooms with awe - inspiring views " i love , love , love being outside , " she says			2
" i take inspiration constantly from things i see in nature			2
" @entity0 : 8 most unique homes you can rent on airbnb today @entity3 is the creative director for @entity38 ; as such , she oversees nine different product categories encompassing everything from teacups to sofas			1
yet she still trades in her leather pumps for @entity45 work boots every friday evening before heading north to the cottage that captured her heart			2
@entity0 : 7 inspiring bathroom makeovers she remembers the first time she saw it : " the realtor and i drove up the drivewayâ € ” it 's really long and goes over a stream , and all the trees were weighed down with snow			1
it was so tucked back ; we were like , ' this has to be a mistake			2
' inside , the owners had left a fire going in the fireplace			2
i fell in love with the place immediately			2
" @entity0 : here 's the newest surprising ' it ' color to decorate with she also fell for the sellers themselves , an older couple who had lived in the house since it was first built as a fishing cabin in the 1960s , and had painstakingly cared for it ever since			1
" they had records for everything : how much they 'd paid , every repair , every warranty			2
and all the tools in the shed were meticulously labeled : ' potato hoe , ' ' garden hoe			2
' " when they moved out , they left her a canoe , a lawn mower , and a sense of reverence for the spirit of the place			2
@entity0 : you know your decorating style is preppy when ... " i told them , ' i 'll never touch anything , ' " says @entity3			1
and for a long time , she kept her word			2
but @entity3 's creativity , it turns out , is not just a contemplative or reactive practice			1
gradually she began making the house her own , installing windows in the back rooms and painting the walls , which were paneled in dark , knotty pine			1
she planted a garden and , because she longed for a new porch , got out a shovel and dug the foundation for it herself , then used the rocks she 'd unearthed to make a stone wall			2
and when a cherry tree started encroaching on the house and had to be cut down , she had the wood milled and used it to make her dining room table			0
an ash tree , meanwhile , became paneling for the bathroom walls			1
finally , two years ago , she undertook a major renovation			0
even then , her motivation was practical as much as it was aesthetic			0
" there was frost on the bedroom windows in the wintertime , " she says			0
" it was n't energy efficient			0
and if you took a bath , you ran out of hot water			0
" she built a studio onto the garage , and outfitted it with a potter 's wheel and supplies to paint and dye fabrics			1
the kitchen , meanwhile , needed a deeper rethinking			0
" the cabinets had scallop edges , " she says			0
" plus it was small , and i love to cook			0
" indeed , @entity3 is known for exotic meals inspired by her frequent travels			1
" my friends joke that i could make food from any country just from what 's in my pantry , " she says			1
the influence of her international travels is evident beyond the pantry as well			0
all over the house are objects and furnishings @entity3 acquired abroad , including rugs from @entity163 , copper faucets from @entity165 , a set of nesting tables from @entity168 ( made of elm , " they 're incredibly fragrant , " she says ) , and a mirrored panel from @entity172			1
interspersed throughout are numerous pieces from the @entity38 collections , which , despite the company 's reputation for austere minimalism , blend happily into the eclectic , rustic mix. " our furniture is modern , but not super- - hard - edged modern , " says @entity3			1
" the materials and finishes make it warm			0
" one of my philosophies at @entity38 is : you ca n't really expect someone to go out and buy all brand - new matching furniture , " she continues			1
" everyone has heirlooms or meaningful pieces with journeys and stories behind them			1
you want to be able to mix them with what is new and modern			1
" at @entity3 's house , that mix is constantly changing in small and subtle ways			1
" i 'm always making little vignettes out of things i find , " she says			0
" last weekend , i found a dead beetle and set it on top of a rock			0
i 'll have that next to a bird 's nest that blew out of a tree , and a feather that i found in the yard			1
" @entity209 keeps her happy ; it always has			0
" when i was little , i had a dollhouse i made myself , " she says			0
" and i loved decorating it			0
i was always working on it			0
then my parents bought me a really swanky new dollhouse , and it was n't as fun			0
" collecting , building , designing , inventing , and playing in the woods : " all the stuff that kids do , " she says			0
" i just made a career out of it			0
