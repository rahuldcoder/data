the fire that engulfed the @entity2 carrying actor @entity1 apparently did not erupt until a minute after the car clipped a light pole saturday			1
that conclusion is based on security camera video obtained by @entity7 that shows black smoke starting to rise from the crash scene 60 seconds after it shows the light pole and a tree falling			1
could @entity1 and the other occupant in the car have made it out in those 60 seconds ? that 's hard to tell			1
the two may have died on impact when the car struck the light pole			1
the answer might be clearer when the coroner 's office releases its preliminary findings of the autopsies of the remains of two men -- presumed to be @entity1 and friend @entity29 , a coroner 's officer said			1
the autopsies were completed tuesday , @entity31 lt. @entity30 said			0
but investigators have placed a " security hold " on it for now			0
the coroner will not even disclose if the identities have been confirmed using dental x-rays			1
officially , the dead are only identified as case numbers			1
@entity30 did not give a reason for the secrecy , which can be requested by law enforcement agencies during an investigation			0
it is often done in cases involving criminal probes , but there has been no indication this is anything more than a traffic accident investigation			0
the autopsies should be able to confirm whether @entity29 , as witnesses reported , was behind the wheel with @entity1 in the passenger seat			1
video obtained by @entity7 tuesday from a security camera posted on a building on the opposite side of the street from the crash does not show the @entity61 crashing along a business park street in @entity63 , @entity64 , saturday afternoon			1
it does show the light pole and tree falling			1
smoke is faintly visible above the scene 60 seconds later , followed by a heavy plume of black smoke after two minutes			0

" and he would say the same thing to me			0
" the @entity1 family issued a statement expressing thanks for " the outpouring of love and goodwill from his many fans and friends			2
" they asked that instead of flowers , people make donations to his charity , @entity151			0

skid marks on the asphalt near the crash site , which indicate a car was doing doughnut spins , also are being examined , @entity176 said			1
