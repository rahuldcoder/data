-- @entity1 is a step closer to becoming the next president of the @entity4 after @entity6 leaders approved his nomination , despite strong opposition from @entity9			1
@entity10 , president of the @entity11 , announced in a tweet : " decision made			0
the @entity11 proposes @entity1 as the next president of the @entity4			2
" only @entity9 prime minister @entity14 and his @entity16 counterpart @entity15 voted against @entity1			1
the former @entity18 prime minister will represent the 28 - strong union globally and become the answer to the question posed by @entity23 presidents for decades : " who do i call if i want to call @entity26 ? " negotiations over the post have been tricky			0
one of the most powerful @entity26 leaders , @entity31 chancellor @entity30 , endorsed the former @entity18 prime minister , who is a member of @entity26 's strongest political party , the center - right @entity32			1
@entity30 and @entity1 share views on closer cooperation and stricter fiscal discipline within the @entity6			2
@entity30 's endorsement was enough to defeat @entity14 , who headed up a group campaigning against @entity1 's appointment in the lead - up to the summit in @entity42 , arguing that @entity1 was too federalist for the job			1
but as the decision neared , @entity14 's allies in @entity45 and @entity46 toned down their opposition and agreed to back @entity1 for the job			2
when the leaders voted on the issue , @entity14 found himself isolated , joined only by @entity16 's @entity51			1
@entity14 , facing pressures from euroskeptics at home , has criticized the @entity6 as being " too big and too bossy			0
" a @entity26 president in favor of even closer cooperation -- as @entity1 advocates -- runs against @entity14 's plans to reform the @entity9 's position within the @entity61 and bring some power back to @entity63			1
the @entity6 election in may saw a surge in the support of euroskeptic parties across @entity26 , which also complicated @entity1 's path to the top job but @entity1 's detractors have failed to come up with a viable alternative			2
names floated included @entity73 , the @entity75 chief , who rejected the idea ; and @entity46 's prime minister @entity77 , famed for her selfie with @entity23 president @entity79 at @entity81 's memorial service last december			0
but no - one emerged as a strong enough candidate to challenge @entity1 and his high - powered backers			0
the newly elected @entity85 will hold a formal vote on @entity1 when it meets next week			0
