the cause of her death is not clear : a bomber blew himself up near @entity6 's limousine and videotape showed a gunman present , though no autopsy has been carried out			1
asked if @entity6 could have been shot , @entity3 said , " yes , absolutely , yes			1
" he has said he welcomes an international investigation			0
@entity3 , who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999 , rejected criticism that his government did not do enough to provide security to @entity6 , who was seeking to regain the post of prime minister			1
he noted that she had already survived one assassination attempt and " was given more security than any other person			0
" asked about the hunt for @entity53 leader @entity52 , widely rumored to be in the remote border region between @entity1 and @entity55 , @entity3 said , " there is no proof whatsoever that he 's here			1
we are not particularly looking for him , but we are operating against this -- and @entity53 and militant @entity61			0
and in the process , obviously , it is combined			0
maybe we are looking for him also			0
" and @entity1 's ambassador to the @entity10 , @entity66 , told @entity2 's " @entity67 " that , " if we knew where he was , we would have taken him out			1
" @entity66 added that @entity3 's comment about " not specifically looking for @entity52 " means that the @entity1 military is " totally focused on destroying @entity53 and the @entity61 network and not just one person			1
" about @entity6 's death , he noted only that the investigation is not completed " and we should not jump to conclusions			1
" still , he added , " if she had not come out of the vehicle , the protected and armored vehicle , maybe we would have seen her smiling face again today			0
" though @entity3 's popularity at home has plummeted , he retains support from @entity84 presidential contender sen. @entity83			1
" i think he 's a good man , " the @entity85 told @entity88 's " @entity87			0
" " but i think he 's made mistakes , do n't get me wrong			0
and we 've got to move forward with these elections and have them free and fair			0
" but i can work with him			0
he understands the threat to his country that the @entity61 and @entity53 present			0
he 's a very smart man			0
he 'd be one of the first to go			0
they 've tried to kill him nine times , ok ? nine times they 've tried to kill @entity3			2
he 's not their favorite guy			0
" the @entity103 reported sunday that the @entity105 administration is considering expanding covert operations in the western part of @entity1 to shore up support for @entity3 's government and to find @entity52 and his second in command , @entity112			1
@entity114 presidential candidate @entity113 of @entity115 told @entity2 's " @entity67 " that , though he had not heard details of the plan , " it sounds like a strategy that makes sense			0
" he added , " we have got to take whatever action is needed			0
" @entity113 has called for @entity3 to step down and has called for free and fair elections			2
" what we need to do is ask @entity3 , push him , push him to step aside for the good of the country , because he is widely unpopular , " he told @entity2			2
sen. @entity128 , a @entity114 presidential candidate from @entity129 , said saturday that she would try to persuade @entity3 to share the responsibility for safeguarding his country 's nuclear weapons with a delegation from the @entity10 and perhaps @entity134			2
meanwhile , detectives from @entity134 's @entity136 saturday examined the scene where @entity6 was assassinated			2
@entity2 cameraman @entity138 said the @entity141 counter-terrorism officers spent more than two hours at the public park at @entity143 in @entity0			1
they also visited the site where @entity6 held a rally just prior to her killing			2
the team of five detectives arrived in @entity1 friday after @entity3 agreed they should work alongside @entity1 agencies to determine how @entity6 was killed and who was responsible for her death			1
the @entity1 interior ministry say the former leader died when she hit her head on the lever of her car 's sunroof after ducking for cover after a suicide bomb attack on her convoy			1
however , supporters of @entity6 insist she was shot prior to the explosion -- a view that some say is supported by video footage of the moments before the blast			2
in @entity0 , police commandos blocked off the road while the @entity141 investigators were walked around the scene by @entity1 police , @entity138 said			1
he said the detectives took photographs and climbed onto a building that overlooked the site of the rally and assassination			2
the investigators also spoke with members of @entity6 's @entity181 ( @entity181 ) at a makeshift shrine positioned on the side of the road where the killing took place , he added			1
they departed the scene under heavy police escort			0
@entity189 , who has stepped in to lead the @entity181 , has called for a @entity191 inquiry into his late wife 's assassination			1
