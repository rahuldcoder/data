@entity0 -- almost 15 months since @entity2 committed suicide , his older brother @entity4 wants people to know that " he 's much more than the way that he died			1
" @entity10 was an 18 - year - old freshman at @entity11 in @entity12 when he jumped off the @entity13 in @entity0 on september 22 , 2010 , after prosecutors say his roommate and another @entity11 student spied on @entity17 kissing another man via a computer webcam			1
his suicide ignited a media firestorm and thrust his brother into the national conversation in a way that @entity17 still finds difficult to grasp			1
" there 's been so much attention and focus on my brother in the media in the last year and a half , since he passed , " @entity17 told @entity1 's @entity25 in an interview airing wednesday on " @entity27 360			1
" " but i felt like his voice and his personality , who he was , got lost completely in a lot of the dialogue that was out there about him			0
" @entity17 said the brother he grew up with for 18 years was quiet and shy , but also extremely curious about the world around him			2
" anything that he did n't know , he would find out everything there was to find out about it , " he said			0
@entity4 , who is gay , said they had n't spoken about each other 's sexuality growing up , but when @entity4 finally came out to @entity10 before @entity10 left for college , he said his younger brother was becoming more comfortable with his own sexuality			2
" i did n't want to push him , " @entity4 said			0
" i actually brought it up to him that i was gay , kind of hoping that he would reciprocate and tell me the same thing about himself			0
... i just wanted him to know so that it would be a safe place and that if he did want to talk to me , he would be able to			2
" @entity10 told @entity4 he was gay , too , and @entity4 said it did n't " seem to be any kind of burden or trouble for him , he seemed ok with it			0
" @entity4 acknowledged that while @entity10 seemed at peace with himself before leaving for college , he must have hidden a pain within him , and he wonders how long he was hiding it			0
" i think he was being brave by being honest with the people around him about his sexuality , and i think he really tried to be a strong person and be an honest person , " @entity4 said			0
" it just seems like he was being punished for that forthrightness and made to be a joke or a laughingstock , and i think that must have taken its toll on him emotionally and mentally			0
" @entity2 's roommate , @entity82 , is facing a 15 - count indictment , which includes hate crime charges , in connection with @entity2 's death			1
he is going on trial on february 21			2
in december , @entity88 turned down a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid jail time			0
" the trial is going to be incredibly emotional , " @entity17 said			1
" i think we 're just hoping for some kind of justice in the court system and putting our faith in the prosecution to do what they need to do			0
" when asked whether he thinks about forgiving @entity88 , @entity17 acknowledged that he 's not quite " there right now , " but said he knows there will be a time for that			1
for now , @entity17 is memorializing @entity10 in an @entity103 article , " letters to my brother			2
" in one of the letters -- they all were written after @entity10 's death -- @entity4 asks how , after coming from the same background , @entity10 always had a " confidence and strength " that @entity4 did n't see in himself			0
" i still , in many ways , wish i was more like him , " @entity17 told @entity1			1
