-- when @entity3 introduces new iphones on tuesday , as everyone expects them to do , the company that practically created the smartphone will face an unusual task : keeping up with the competition			1
there 's still plenty to be said for the @entity10 's sleek , simple design , easy - to - navigate operating system and tidy " closed garden " app environment			1
but as phones running @entity18 's @entity17 operating system , particularly @entity19 's , have gained in popularity , @entity10 owners have increasingly found themselves looking around and wondering , " why ca n't my phone do that ? " many @entity17 phones have bigger screens than the @entity10			1
some are water - resistant and can even snap photos underwater			0
@entity17 apps can update automatically			0
users can control @entity32 's new @entity31 phone with their voice , without touching it			0
and that 's just the beginning			0
add to that the fact that many in the tech world saw the @entity43 and @entity10 as incremental advances , not the seismic leaps forward we 'd come to expect from @entity3 , and you 've got the more pressure on the company to ramp up the " wow ! " factor			1
" the smartphone market is more competitive overall , and in the high - end it has become a duopoly between @entity19 and @entity3 , " said @entity49 , a consumer - technology researcher with @entity51			2
" many feel that @entity3 needs to regain the distance they once had over their competitors			1
" the @entity10 has remained the world 's top selling smartphone , save for a few quarters when it was dethroned by phones in @entity19 's @entity62			1
but after making up nearly 24 % of all smartphones sold in late 2011 , @entity3 's device is now down to about 14 % , while @entity17 phones account for a whopping 79 %			1
the @entity10 and @entity74 " were revolutionary when they first came out , but ( rival ) products that are out there now are about as close to @entity3 's devices as they 've ever been , " @entity66 , an analyst at @entity67 , told @entity68			1
" the question is whether @entity3 is going to introduce products that are different enough from their competitors			1
" so , what could we see come tuesday ? the most high - profile feature that 's been rumored for the new @entity10 is a fingerprint scanner			1
such a security feature would let users register a finger or thumb print and use it to unlock their phone			0
there are reports the phone could be able to access @entity90 , a network that would make it faster than phones with @entity95 connections			0
that network is not yet available in many areas of the @entity97 , however			0
@entity3 reportedly also is looking at adding bigger display screens for the @entity10 , but they would likely be for future models , not the phones coming this week			1
as usual , @entity3 is expected to upgrade the phone with a faster processor , better battery life and an improved camera			2
but those are the sort of pragmatic upgrades that , while arguably most important to user experience , do n't turn heads the way a novelty like @entity111 , the @entity43 's voice - activated digital assistant , did in 2011			2
@entity49 says @entity3 needs something more than standard upgrades to get its mojo back			2
but that shot of adrenalin might arrive in an unconventional way			0
" @entity3 needs a new ' hero product , ' but i do not think it necessarily has to be a phone , " she said			0
" with technology innovation slowing down , maybe they are better off turning @entity10 into a market - share grabber and showing innovation in another product			2
" the most likely candidate there could be the company 's anticipated " @entity128			0
" @entity3 is all but certain to be joining the emerging smartwatch market that @entity19 entered last week with its @entity132 device			0
if @entity3 blows away the competition with a watch that transcends the existing options ( as well as those expected from @entity18 and @entity138 ) , it could bring back some of the excitement that once met the unveiling of groundbreaking products like the @entity142 , @entity10 and @entity74			1
opinions are split as to whether @entity3 will introduce a watch tuesday			1
@entity3 typically does n't launch other major products at @entity10 events			1
but an @entity147 rollout later this year or in early 2014 would miss at least some of the coveted holiday - shopping season while giving @entity19 and other smartwatch makers a big head start in the marketplace			0
then there 's the long anticipated , but yet unseen , @entity3 tv set ( as opposed to the @entity155 streaming device that already exists )			2
moving onto customer wrists , and into living rooms , might deflate pressure to sex up the @entity10			0
still , it 's hard to imagine a tech world in which the @entity10 is n't seen as an elite device			2
that 's why , when ceo @entity165 takes the stage tuesday in @entity167 , all eyes will be on him .			0

@entity3 is expected to introduce new iphones on tuesday
many say company needs to make a splash to match its competitors
past two @entity10 upgrades were viewed as incremental by some
analyst : other products , not the @entity10 , may *re-establish* @entity3 's rep for innovation
