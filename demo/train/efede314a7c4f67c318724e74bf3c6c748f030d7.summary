-- @entity1 is the breakout social network of 2012 , but even technology addicts could be excused for missing its rise to success			1
the web - based " pinboard , " which launched almost two years ago , barely got a mention on @entity7 news sites until six months ago , when early adopters suddenly realized that a site with millions of monthly users had sprung up almost unnoticed by the tech press			0
that 's because @entity1 did n't take the usual route of web - based startups : romancing early adopters and technology journalists before attempting to " cross the chasm " to mainstream adoption			1
instead , @entity1 grew a devoted base of users -- most of them female -- who enjoy " pinning " items they find around the @entity22			1
while clothing , home decor and recipes dominate the site , inspirational quotes and humor are also popular topics for users to add to their pinboards			0
interest , meet @entity1 : site helps users catalog their passions how successful is @entity1 ? unique visitors to the site grew 400 % from september to december 2011 , and just last week one study showed that @entity1 drives more visitors to third - party websites than @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 combined			1
demographics are surely a large part of @entity1 's success : while technology 's early adopters have sprung upon other interest - driven networks like @entity49 , these sites now suffer from a form of " cumulative disadvantage " in which mainstream users are put off by how tech - centric they 've become			1
@entity54 , a bookmarking service that hit it big during the " @entity22 " era , relaunched recently with a @entity1 - like interface , but has failed to attract the same audience			1
@entity60 , meanwhile , is a similar pinboard concept , but caters mainly to those who keep up with the latest web memes and inside jokes			0
@entity1 , by contrast , provides no barrier to entry for anyone looking to bookmark , share and comment on images and ideas from around the @entity22			2
@entity72 : what 's your @entity1 passion ? there 's more to @entity1 than its unique audience , however			1
if you 'd mapped out the evolution of social sharing online a few years ago , you might have predicted that something like @entity1 would emerge			1
as tech entrepreneur @entity81 insightfully explained in an article on his blog last month , sharing on the @entity22 has been following three parallel trends			0
the first is that sharing involves less effort over time			0
the second is that social sites are becoming more visual over time			2
and the third is that " people - centric " recommendations are being augmented by " topic - centric " networks -- which is to say that while @entity94 lets you explore the web through information shared by friends , newer social networks organize content by topics of interest			1
some in the technology industry call this the " interest graph			0
" social networks began with blogging tools like @entity105 and @entity106 , where you had to write an entire blog post to express yourself			0
then along came @entity109 and @entity94 , and a simple status update was all that was required to share a thought on the @entity22			0
these sites then discovered even simpler ways to share : " retweeting " the updates of others and " liking " web pages on @entity94			0
@entity118 , now one of the biggest blogging platforms , also fits the trend : not only is it largely used to share images , but " reblogging " the posts of others is a primary activity on the site			0
as for the trend toward organizing content by both topics and the stuff your friends enjoy , you only need to look as far last year 's hit news app : @entity135 , which turns the news into a more visual experience on your @entity138 , personalizing your experience by highlighting links shared by your online connections and topics you find interesting			2
pinterest checks all the boxes : it 's a visual social network that organizes images by topic and lets you reshare with just one click			1
so will we see a thousand @entity1 clones bloom , or will the site 's stellar growth continue despite others jumping on the trend ? i 'd say success is assured for @entity1			2
thanks to the " network effects " of these sites -- you join because your friends are already there -- it 'll becoming increasingly hard to compete with the new king , or perhaps queen , of social bookmarking .			2

unique visitors to @entity1 grew 400 % from september to december 2011
@entity1 drives more visitors to third - party websites than @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42
it 's a visual social network that organizes by topic and lets you reshare with one click
