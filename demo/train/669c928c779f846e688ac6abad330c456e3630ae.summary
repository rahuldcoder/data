-- in 1967 , the @entity1 had a hit with a song that detailed , with bittersweet harmonies , the checkered history of the band			1
the song , written by the group 's @entity8 and his wife , @entity10 , was called " @entity11			1
" @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity8 , here in 1998 , were members of the @entity1			1
if the song were to be updated today , it might have to be retitled " @entity18			0
" with the claims by @entity8 's daughter , @entity24 , that she had an incestuous relationship with her father , the story of @entity8 and his group -- in music , models of @entity21 dreams and @entity21 dreamin ' -- takes on a darker hue			1
the story was already tangled , a motley love - and drug - soaked tale of excess set to the group 's distinctive four - part harmonies			1
@entity8 left his first wife , @entity24 's mother , @entity36 , for 18 - year - old @entity10 , whom he 'd met in a @entity38 club while touring in the early ' 60s , according to the band 's biography on @entity41			1
the band 's lead male singer , @entity14 , later had an affair with @entity10 ; she was forced out of the group for a time			2
the fourth member , @entity47 , had an unrequited crush on @entity14 , the biography noted			0
after the @entity1 ' success with such singles as " @entity51 " and the no. 1 hit " monday , monday , " the @entity52 bought a @entity54 mansion from which they ruled over the @entity56 music scene			1
in his 1986 memoir , " @entity8 , " @entity8 , who died in 2001 , remembered hosting parties for the @entity60 when they visited town			1
@entity8 , the band 's primary songwriter , was at least six years older than the others and did not shy from the task of addressing the group 's pain and confusion in song			1
in such songs as " got a @entity71 ' , " " @entity69 " and " trip , @entity80 , " he cast a cold eye on the band 's romantic entanglements , even as his melancholy and sometimes cutting lyrics were often belied by those sunny harmonies and @entity78 's slick production			2
" one does n't try to hold @entity47 and @entity14 and @entity10 together , " he said in a 1995 interview			0
" it 's a useless task to start with			0
you just sort of stay out of the way and let things roll as they can			0
" in 1968 , the group split up			2
there was a 1971 reunion that produced the contractually obligated album " @entity91 , " but the experience was " horrible , " @entity8 recalled in the liner notes to the group 's anthology , " @entity96			1
" the group members had mixed success after the breakup			2
@entity47 , who died of a heart attack in 1974 ( and not by choking on a sandwich , as urban legend has it ) , pursued a solo career ; she had a handful of hits			2
@entity14 and @entity8 also tried their hands at solo careers ; the latter 's 1970 " @entity114 , " produced a minor hit and is now considered a classic but sold relatively poorly upon release			1
more common were the stories of trouble			0
@entity10 and @entity8 divorced in 1970 ; late that year , @entity10 was married to @entity117 for eight days			1
@entity8 , who married @entity118 in 1972 , became increasingly immersed in drugs , says his @entity41 biography , to the point where he could n't finish an album commissioned by the @entity124 ' @entity123 and @entity125			1
in 1981 , he was convicted of drug trafficking			1
by that point , daughter @entity24 says , she was also a full - blown drug addict			1
" i grew up in a place where there were no rules ... which did not serve me well , and everybody , i think , knew that , " she said on a reunion special for her ' 70s sitcom , " @entity131			0
" according to @entity137 and @entity141 's " the @entity138 to @entity139 and @entity140 , " @entity8 missed the 1980 - 81 season while in rehab for addiction issues			1
in her new book , " @entity149 , " she claims she had become sexually involved with her father in 1979 , after he forced sex on her the night before she married a rock manager , @entity148			2
( earlier that year , the house she shared with @entity148 burned down , taking all her belongings with it			0
) according to @entity155 , the affair with her father lasted 10 years			0
she told @entity156 , her half - sister , about the affair in the late ' 90s , according to an interview with @entity156 in @entity91 magazine			0
" somebody could have dropped a piano on my head , and i probably would n't have felt it , " @entity156 told the magazine			0
" but i knew it was true			0
i mean , who in their right mind would make such a claim if it was n't true ? " she says the news sent her into " a deep , deep sadness and depression for about 10 days			0
a part of me died when i found out			0
" @entity8 also underwent rehab but struggled for the rest of his life			1
he had a liver transplant in 1992 but was photographed drinking several months later			0
he toured with versions of the @entity1 , some including @entity24			1
he died in 2001 of heart failure			1
@entity156 and @entity24 's " @entity131 " co-star @entity179 have since rallied around her			2
" i am stunned by @entity24 's terrible allegations about her father , " @entity181 , @entity8 ' third wife , wrote in a statement released to " the @entity184			1
" @entity155 appeared on the show wednesday			0
" i would often complain about her overly familiar attitudes towards him , and he said it was just her way			0
@entity8 was a good man			2
... he was incapable , no matter how drunk or drugged he was , to have sexual relations with his own child			0
" and @entity24 's half - brother , @entity196 , the follower of an @entity198 guru , is having none of it			2
" my family is and always will be a decrepit bowl of dog urine compared to @entity204 of @entity205			0
that is how great @entity204 is , " he told the @entity207 's @entity206			0
" @entity204 , not the @entity8 family			2
