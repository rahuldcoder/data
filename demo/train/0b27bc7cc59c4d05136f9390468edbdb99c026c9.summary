@entity0 -- if @entity5 @entity4 have their way this summer , the @entity3 - era tax cuts would become permanent , " @entity8 " would begin to be dismantled and energy regulations would be rolled back			1
on friday , @entity5 @entity4 leaders unveiled their summer agenda with an eye on the fall campaign , including those and other items that probably wo n't become law , but will highlight the party 's message on the economy			1
in a memo to @entity4 members , majority leader @entity18 promised a vote on the most contentious issue -- extending the @entity3 - era tax cuts that expire at the end of the year â € ” before the @entity5 begins its monthlong summer break in august			1
@entity4 leaders have been mum on the details , but the measure is expected to renew the current rates for some period and lay out a framework for tax reform that lowers rates across the board			2
many of the details , however , including which deductions would be eliminated , would be put off until next year			0
@entity18 's memo says the @entity5 will focus in the coming months on " addressing job creation and the economy , reducing spending and shrinking the size of the federal government while protecting and expanding liberty			2
" in addition to the tax issue , the majority of items @entity18 cites for floor action -- votes to repeal portions of @entity8 , roll back " job - inhibiting " red tape and press for more domestic energy production -- will land with a thud in the @entity57 - led @entity56			1
senate majority leader @entity58 has made it clear that anything the @entity4 - led @entity5 passes dealing with taxes or deficit cuts is @entity63 in the @entity56			1
with the november election five months away and almost zero motivation for bipartisan cooperation , the reality is that any major action will be postponed until after the election			0
the fiscal cliff another thorny issue facing @entity72 : how to deal with automatic spending cuts to federal agencies scheduled to go into effect in january as part of the budget deal last summer			1
republicans in the @entity5 and @entity56 are pushing bills to fence off any impact on defense with deeper cuts to domestic programs			2
in a recent letter to @entity4 senators , @entity58 said the @entity4 line in the sand against new revenues means no deal on these issues can happen			2
" unfortunately , it appears that @entity4 ' blind adherence to tea party extremism is making it impossible to reach this sort of balanced agreement before the election , " @entity58 wrote			1
@entity18 's memo leaves out how the @entity5 will deal with some lingering and politically charged issues before the election			1
both democrats and @entity4 say they want to avoid interest rates on student loans doubling in july , but there is no agreement yet on how to pay for legislation to head off the increase			1
the @entity5 passed a bill targeting what the @entity4 says is a " slush fund " that pays for public health programs as part of the health care law			1
@entity103 want to offset the costs with a tax on some businesses			0
after the @entity56 failed to pass either party 's preferred plan , the standoff continues			0
transportation , women , drugs , post office on agenda while both chambers passed legislation -- the " @entity129 " -- that funds programs combating domestic abuse , the issue has become a political battle , with @entity103 arguing @entity4 resistance to expanding protections to gays and lesbians and native americans amounts to a " war on women			0
" @entity4 counter that @entity103 hijacked the measure for political purposes and are picking a " fake fight " to appeal to female voters			0
@entity5 and @entity56 leaders are also still negotiating details on a multiyear transportation bill that gives states billions of dollars for new infrastructure projects			0
but both sides are tangling over how long to authorize the federal program and the @entity4 's insistence that the bill include authorization for the @entity156 pipeline that would transport oil from @entity158 down to the @entity159			0
there are some areas where bipartisan action is expected			0
after the @entity164 holiday the @entity5 will take up a bipartisan intelligence bill , and legislation reforming how the @entity167 approves new drugs , a measure that passed overwhelmingly in the @entity56			0
the @entity5 will vote on @entity172 chariman @entity171 's proposal to overhaul the postal service , which will need to be reconciled with a different package the @entity56 passed this month			0
dialing up the rhetoric the @entity4 agenda signals the rhetoric on the @entity5 floor in june and july will match the sticky @entity0 heat			1
the @entity4 is planning votes on energy bills most democrats oppose , pushing for more drilling on public lands and removing federal regulations on energy producers			0
@entity187 , spokesman for @entity189 @entity188 , immediately dismissed the @entity4 calendar			0
" the @entity4 have spelled out an agenda that fails to address jobs and will hold the middle class tax cuts hostage because the @entity4 refuses to let millionaires , @entity194 and corporations that ship jobs overseas pay their fair share , " @entity187 said			0
while both parties eagerly await the ruling from the @entity202 @entity201 on whether the president 's signature health care law will stand , the @entity5 will vote to repeal a tax on medical devices that helps fund the law and overturn a provision of the law that would prohibit the use of personal spending accounts to pay for over the counter medications			1
@entity4 congressional leaders have been huddling on how to address health care if the high court strikes down the law , but aides caution that nothing has been decided on what kind of reforms @entity4 would pursue if they were given a clean slate			1
continuing their pledge to slash federal spending , the @entity5 will also vote on bills reducing federal agencies ' budgets , but few of these bills are expected to pass the @entity56 , so both sides are gearing up for negotiations on a short - term bill to keep the government funded after the current authority runs out in september			2
while there may be a flurry of activity this summer on @entity238 , it 's safe to say the december " lame duck " session of @entity72 will be a jam - packed month where most of these issues will be resolved .			2

@entity5 @entity4 want to roll back regulation , dismantle " @entity8 "
none of these measures will likely become law , but are election - year *manuevering*
@entity72 must act by the end of the year to avoid dire fiscal consequences
