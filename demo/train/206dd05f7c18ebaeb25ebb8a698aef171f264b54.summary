-- a movement urging @entity2 to get rid of wireless contracts appears to be gaining steam			1
a petition calling for the carrier to end contracts for smartphones and " create an affordable way for consumers to purchase their devices " had attracted more than 60,000 signatures by wednesday morning on @entity13 , the online petition platform			1
@entity15 , a @entity2 customer and blogger from @entity17 , @entity18 , said he started the @entity13 petition 11 days ago after he heard @entity2 ceo @entity20 say he 'd consider killing cell phone contracts if consumers asked for it			1
" i believe that people should have the freedom of choice ... to move freely between carriers , " @entity15 told @entity0 in a phone interview			1
" i think that model where you tie customers in for two or three years is a tired model that does n't need to exist anymore			0
" for years , most wireless carriers have subsidized the high cost of smartphones -- often $ 600 or more -- by requiring customers to sign long - term contracts			0
customers who try to switch carriers before their contract is up often face hefty penalties -- up to $ 350 for @entity2 customers , according to the carrier 's early - termination policy			1
but @entity43 shook up the wireless industry last month by announcing it would revamp its pricing models to eliminate contracts			2
instead , @entity43 's new service plans require that customers pay for their smartphones either up front or in monthly payments over two years			1
@entity15 's petition urges @entity2 to follow @entity43 's lead and get rid of contracts for wireless service			1
@entity13 put the petition on its homepage monday after it received more than 7,000 signatures on saturday alone			2
a spokesperson for @entity2 would not comment specifically on the petition			0
" @entity63 has for years offered many different choices for customers , including contract plans or month - to - month plans that do not require a contract , " said spokeswoman @entity61 in a prepared statement			0
@entity63 does offer its phones without a contract as well , but requires the consumer to pay the full price of the phone upfront			0
for instance , a @entity75 iphone 5 costs $ 200 with a two - year contract but $ 650 without a contract			0
@entity79 and @entity80 offer virtually identical pricing			0
@entity15 said he 's hoping @entity2 will agree to reduce or eliminate early - termination fees for existing customers and lower prices on phones sold without contracts			2
he said monday he had n't heard from the carrier since he launched his petition .			0
