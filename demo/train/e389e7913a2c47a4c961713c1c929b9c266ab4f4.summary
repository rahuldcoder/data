@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 on friday told 149 regional airports across the country it would begin closing their air traffic control towers in april , but said it would spare another 40 towers that had been on the chopping block			1
the agency said the cuts are necessary to help meet $ 637 million in forced spending cuts			0
the tower closures will begin april 7 and will be phased in over four weeks , @entity3 chief operating officer @entity13 said in a memo obtained by @entity2			1
some towers were spared after the @entity3 considered appeals from towers , and consulted with the departments of defense and homeland security			1
among those to be closed are towers at regional airports in @entity0 , @entity1 , and near @entity25 , @entity26 , that were built with federal stimulus money and have been open less than a year			1
read the full list of tower closures the decision " will have both short - term and long - term effects , " warned the @entity30			0
" these towers serve other important functions -- including law enforcement activity , medical transport flights , search and rescue missions , business and commerce and supporting flight schools across @entity44 , " the association said in a statement			0
" ultimately , the partisan posturing in @entity46 that led to sequestration is the reason for ( friday 's ) decision and its destructive effects on aviation			0
" the @entity3 had been expected to announce the closure of 189 low - or moderate - volume towers staffed by contractors			1
before friday 's announcement , it said it would consider keeping a tower open if the airport convinces the agency it is in the " national interest " to do so			2
new air traffic control towers among those on chopping block a news release from the @entity3 quoted transportation secretary @entity64 as saying , " we heard from communities across the country about the importance of their towers and these were very tough decisions ... unfortunately we are faced with a series of difficult choices that we have to make to reach the required cuts under sequestration			1
" by congressional mandate , the @entity3 must cut nearly $ 600 million from its nearly $ 48 billion budget this fiscal year			2
because the majority of its 47,000 employees are air traffic controllers , it is impossible to cut its budget without affecting controllers , the agency said			0
@entity3 administrator @entity84 said in the agency 's news release that the agency " will work with the airports and the operators to ensure the procedures are in place to maintain the high level of safety at non-towered airports			1
" two @entity96 members of @entity97 -- sen. @entity98 of @entity99 , ranking member of the @entity101 ; and rep. @entity102 of @entity103 , chairman of the @entity104 -- wrote to @entity64 calling for " a detailed justification and explanation for how the @entity3 determined each contract tower would be closed			0
" " it is worth noting that , the specified towers in the @entity110 were all operational in 2009 , when the @entity3 received less funding than it will under sequestration , " the two said in their letter			2
their was no immediate response from @entity64 or the @entity3 to the letter			0
