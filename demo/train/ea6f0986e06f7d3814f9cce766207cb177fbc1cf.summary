@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is nestled in darkness			1
born just 24 weeks into gestation , he weighs scarcely more than a pound			2
he can hear the faint sounds of the outside world mingling with the soothing sound of his mother 's voice			1
his spindly arms and legs shake as he lets out a warble			2
" oh , my love , " coos his mother , @entity16 , 31			2
" you 're going to be ok			2
" @entity16 's hands descend -- one landing lightly on @entity3 's chest while the other pushes against his jerking legs			2
she is using touch and light pressure to simulate , for her premature son , her own womb			1
a few moments later , @entity3 stops crying			2
" when he was born he was so tiny , " said @entity3			2
" it was like , ' oh wow , can a baby even survive outside the womb this early ? ' " medical advances are improving outcomes for even the tiniest babies			1
experts say fewer than 1 % are born in the " micro preemie " category ; at the hospital where @entity3 is being treated , @entity38 in @entity1 , that means born before 28 weeks or born weighing less than 2.2 pounds			1
" survival rates ( among micro preemies ) have been improving , " said @entity41 , a neonatal nurse practitioner at @entity38			1
" so they may survive to discharge			2
but then growing up as children they have a lot of complications			2
" doctors and nurses at a specialized unit at @entity38 have implemented a system they say is dramatically reducing disability and infection rates among this rare preemie population			2
aptly named the @entity56 , the staff work under the cover of darkness and quiet in a separate wing of the hospital			1
here , stimulation is kept to a minimum ; speaking is only done in hushed voices			2
the overall effect is one of relative calm : an attempt to mimic what babies would experience if they were still safely tucked in utero			1
" we try to keep it low sound , low lights , so that it is as close to the womb as we can get , " said @entity73 , coordinator of the @entity74 at @entity38			1
" we try to minimize the intrusion to them			2
" in 2009 , before the @entity56 was up and running , 45 % of babies were discharged with chronic lung disease			1
in 2012 , after the unit had been operating for three years , the rate was down to 27 %			1
infection rates from 2009 to 2012 dipped from 41 % to 15 % , and feeding , weight and head circumference have also improved			1
dr. @entity92 , chairwoman of the @entity94 ' committee on the fetus and newborn , said that developing processes to treat extremely low birthweight babies is -- broadly speaking -- a good thing			1
but since @entity38 's data are self - reflexive , she questions what exactly is contributing to the unit 's success			0
" when someone starts focusing on something , it tends to trend better , " said @entity92			0
" what made it happen ? we do n't know			0
" @entity92 said that some elements of what is being done at @entity38 , including various forms of touch therapy , can be beneficial to premature infants			1
a large study published in 2004 found 21 % to 48 % greater weight gain among infants undergoing moderate massage therapy ; they also were discharged sooner from the hospital			1
other studies suggest that specific types of massage therapy stimulate production of growth hormones and promote bone development			0
at the @entity56 , parents act as " therapists " and partners with the staff , so they are engaged fully with their child 's progress			1
studies show that mothers who massage their infants experience decreased depression and anxiety			0
' it can hurt to be touched ' @entity3 is learning about the thin line between stimulating and overstimulating her son			0
" for preemies , it can hurt to be touched because their skin is n't ready for it , " explained @entity141 , a developmental therapist working with @entity3			1
@entity146 grabs @entity3 's hand			0
" let me show you on your hand , " she said , pressing on @entity3 's palm to show her how firmly to touch @entity3			1
" it 's not heavy , but it 's also not superlight			0
" " remember , when he was inside the womb there was amniotic fluid , and there was a feeling of that moving across every skin cell of his body , " @entity146 said			1
" that 's what helps babies know , ' where do i start and where do i stop ? ' " when babies are born early like @entity3 , they do n't have that option , so now they have to learn their body in the midst of air			1
it 's a lot different			0
" soon , @entity3 will lie -- tubes and all -- skin - to - skin on his mother 's chest for an hour or more , something referred to as kangaroo care			0
painful medical interventions like intubation , extubation and blood draws are performed while a baby is skin - to - skin with a parent whenever possible			1
in those situations , touch is thought to mitigate pain			1
" @entity196 , " as mothers here refer to it , also helps with bonding and regulating things like respiration and sleep among babies			1
for mothers , it may stimulate breast milk production			0
" it calms me when he 's ' kangarooing ' with me , and i notice he 's more calm , " said @entity3			0
she pauses as tears roll down her face			0
" it 's nice to know that those things help him			0
you cling to those little things that can ease things for him			0
" @entity3 's care here is in stark contrast to what he got during his first few days of life , in a traditional @entity216 at another local hospital			1
there , according to his parents , the lights and noise were blaring			0
" ( this unit ) is a laser focus on this very specific patient population			0
i think that is what makes this so unique , " said dr. @entity225 , medical director of the @entity74 at @entity38			1
" other places i 've worked you will have a tiny premature baby next to an older child who has a heart condition , next to another child who may be crying , " he continued			0
" so there 's ... a lot of other stimuli to this little tiny preemie and it 's not done purposely			0
it 's just the layout of whatever unit they 're in			0
" @entity92 of the @entity94 said it is important to strike a balance , adding that theories and approaches regarding noise in the @entity248 are constantly evolving			0
" we used to think it should be quiet , so when these babies came into the world too soon , we 'd turn off the lights and make it quiet , " said @entity92 , a professor of pediatrics and neonatology at the @entity251			1
" turns out babies were hearing a fair amount of noise in utero , and that maybe if it 's too quiet they are not hearing the kind of language they need			1
" she cites recent research that suggests too little sound could interfere with a baby 's acquisition of speech and language , and that exposure to speech can enhance brain development in babies			1
similarly , she said , too much darkness could be counterproductive to a baby 's development , since in utero a baby would be exposed to a stream of information from its mother reflecting her own changing circadian rhythms			0
" we know that what happens in the @entity248 affects babies long term , " said @entity92			1
" so i 'm pleased that this group is working on it , but the information we have is always in process			0
" numbers in the @entity56 , numbers mean a lot			1
when @entity3 was born , they went something like this : 47 % chance he 'd survive , and if he did survive , only a 31 % chance he would escape serious neurodevelopmental problems			2
@entity3 and her husband , @entity296 , temper the harsh reality of those statistics by focusing on other numbers â € ” milestones @entity3 is reaching from day to day , week to week			0
@entity3 has already defied the steep odds that he would not survive : today , he is 7 weeks old			0
" we celebrated 10 grams last night , " said @entity16 of @entity3 's weight gain since he was admitted to the @entity56			1
" it 's like ' ( he is ) 2 pounds ! wow ! ' " the @entity306 believe that @entity3 's future prospects are improving because of his treatment -- in particular , the emphasis on touch -- in the @entity56			1
three weeks and 10 ounces later , he is less reliant on supplemental oxygen and is less averse to touch			2
" @entity16 , you want to massage him ? " asks @entity146			0
" yes , " says @entity3 , who glances up at the numbers changing favorably on a monitor above her			0
" weeks earlier , the monitor beeped incessantly			0
today , @entity3 seems relatively calm -- more ok with his surroundings			0
although some of the science behind what happens in the @entity56 eludes her , @entity3 knows that one alternative -- little or no contact between her and @entity3 -- would leave her empty emotionally			1
she recalls an article she read recently describing how most @entity326 operated years ago			0
" moms would n't touch their kids , " said @entity3			2
" they would look at them through the glass wall			0
my heart broke for them			0
" not to be able to hold them or touch them or do any of that stuff ? " she added			2
" all of that fulfills what i long for			0
it gives me something , even though it 's little			0

fewer than 1 % of babies are " micro preemies , " a term that varies in *definition* by hospital
@entity56 at @entity1 hospital mimics womb with soft lighting , low sounds
experts say touch can help mitigate pain of medical procedures for preemies
