-- all of us as drivers have failed at one point or another to yield at a stop sign			2
most of the time we get away with it			0
sometimes we get stopped by the police			2
the punishment usually includes a court date and / or a fine			0
sometimes , apparently , it can lead to something much worse			0
in @entity13 , @entity14 , according to a lawsuit filed in federal court , failing to yield can lead to ... an anal cavity search			1
the shocking allegations of @entity20 's complaint are worth a read , though at least the defendant - prosecutor has denied many of them			0
the other defendants include the arresting police officers , the hospital and doctors			2
irrespective of whether the allegations are ultimately proven , this lawsuit raises some larger questions : how do police get from a traffic stop to a colonoscopy ? the @entity35 protects all citizens from unreasonable search and seizure by the government			1
it requires that the greater the intrusion upon the person , the greater must be the reason for conducting a search			2
is there ever a good reason for this kind of search ? the answer is yes			0
the police can get access to your most intimate parts and even their interiors			0
the law is clear : sometimes a search of one 's cavity is justified			1
fortunately , police ca n't do this on a whim			0
they need what we call " probable cause " that that part of your body contains contraband			1
that means a lot more than an arbitrary hunch or guess			0
then , beyond that , they have to convince a judge or a magistrate of the likelihood of contraband in your rectum , and that judge has to issue a search warrant independently -- though defense attorneys would argue this is less an independent process and more a one - sided affair			1
the only real way around the warrant requirement is an exigency -- that is the evidence is likely to disappear during the delay in securing a warrant			0
a warrant for an anal cavity search must also provide specifics on the medical procedure to be used to be reasonable			1
but the underlying question remains : how were the police in this case able to articulate probable cause for a rectal warrant from a traffic violation ? bad posture ? according to the complaint , one of the officers noticed @entity20 's " posture to be erect and he kept his legs together			1
" it 's often said you can read a lot into the way someone carries himself			0
a lot of people stand different ways			0
sometimes it means you have good , militarylike bearing			0
other times it means you have a strong back			0
to police in this case , apparently , standing erect can mean something else : you may have drugs in your anal cavity			1
and with that interpretation , police have a starting point for their probable cause to get that warrant			1
to bolster their probable cause , police also allegedly justified the " search " by citing @entity20 's reputation			1
a reputation perhaps in school you had a friend who had a reputation for being cheap			0
that 's one kind of reputation			0
to police , according to the complaint , @entity20 had a reputation , too -- for carrying around drugs in his rectum			1
to most civilians , that does n't even sound like a kind of reputation			0
to police , however , that reputation was allegedly further justification for an invasive warrant			1
it will be interesting to see in this litigation how substantiated this prior reputation was			0
how does a rumor like this get started ? the police in this case also used a narcotics canine to sniff @entity20 's vehicle			0
the canine apparently alerted police to the driver 's seat of @entity20 's truck			0
while courts have held that a police canine alert is sufficient probable cause for a drug search of a car , there is no question that the upholstery of a car seat should not be considered the same as the interior of someone 's body cavity			1
even a canine alert of someone 's pants area should not automatically constitute probable cause for a colonoscopy warrant			1
the law is well - settled in this area : for a rectal search , police need a high degree of probable cause and a warrant			1
@entity192 once police were armed with a warrant , @entity20 's complaint alleges he was subjected to a prolonged detention , including two trips to different hospitals , two rectal searches , three enemas , two x-rays and a colonoscopy			1
at each stage , the complaint alleges , no drugs were found , but according to @entity20 , the search continued well into the next day with increasingly invasive procedures			1
if anyone other than the police conducted this kind of nonconsensual physical invasion of another 's rectum , based upon a posture and a reputation , they 'd likely be civilly and criminally liable			1
but when the police physically invade your person , they often enjoy what 's called " qualified immunity " from lawsuits			2
to be sure , the idea behind immunity for police action is sound : it would be a massive disincentive to law enforcement if it feared liability over every decision			2
generally , police wo n't be liable for bad searches if they have a good argument for probable cause			2
courts will consider whether a reasonably well - trained officer would have known that he failed to establish probable cause and that he never should have applied for the warrant			2
as a society , we accept that the police are empowered to invade our privacy in ways members of the public can not			0
if they have the requisite probable cause and a warrant , law enforcement has the power to invade our homes , our vehicles , and -- like it or not -- our rectums			2
this has led many to ask whether the very people entrusted with the power to invade our bodies physically should legally be subjected to more scrutiny rather than general immunity			2
members of the public who are concerned they will be subjected to this kind of cavity search as part of a routine traffic stop can probably rest easy ; it appears from the face of the complaint that @entity20 was someone who was on law enforcement radar for some time			1
just being " known to " police does n't justify a cavity search , but it assuages the average citizen that his own body is not a high - value target			1
but at minimum , @entity20 's ordeal may make us all think twice about rolling through that next stop sign			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity279 .			2

@entity14 man sues , alleges traffic stop led to anal cavity search by police
@entity279 says police have the right to search body if they have a warrant
@entity290 says police concluded man was *hiding* drugs by his posture and by speculation
@entity279 : police need probable cause to get a warrant and *typically* have immunity from suits
