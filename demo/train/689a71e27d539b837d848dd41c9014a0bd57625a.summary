with @entity2 probably heading for an exit from the euro , the @entity1 and global economies may be facing disaster			1
however , there is still time for @entity1 leaders to reverse this destructive dynamic with one simple , outside - the - box solution : instead of pushing @entity2 out of the eurozone , @entity9 should voluntarily withdraw and reissue its beloved deutsche mark			1
the analysis of the problems of the euro and the @entity15 has long been upside down , focused on the debt and competitive weaknesses of the so - called peripheral countries ( @entity2 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 ) and especially of @entity2			1
but issues of debt and competitiveness existed and were dealt with rather easily long before the euro arrived , through periodic devaluation of the currencies of the less - competitive countries against those of the more competitive countries , and especially against the deutsche mark			2
the problem now is not the weaknesses of the periphery , it 's the excessive competitive strength of @entity9			2
not only is the @entity9 economy inherently strong as a result of the high productivity of its workforce , its exports have added competitiveness because the euro is undervalued as far as @entity9 is concerned			2
because it is the common currency of the eurozone countries , the value of the euro reflects the average of their combined competitiveness			1
but @entity9 's competitiveness is far above the average			0
so , for @entity9 , the euro is too weak			2
this is why @entity9 has been accumulating chronic trade surpluses on the scale of the @entity57			0
as long as the rest of the eurozone countries are locked in the euro with @entity9 , the only way for them to become more competitive is to become , well , more @entity62 , through austerity measures that cut government spending , reduce welfare budgets , cut wages and raise unemployment			1
this is , of course , what they have been doing for the past two years			0
the aim has been to achieve export - led growth			0
but because @entity9 is so hypercompetitive and has been unwilling to stimulate its own economy to achieve higher consumption , its eurozone partners have not been able to increase exports to it and have had thus to compete with it in exporting to the likes of @entity57 and the @entity82			2
that has n't been working very well , and now the consequences of grinding austerity are beginning to tear the political and social fabric even of countries like the @entity89 , which until quite recently were enthusiastically echoing the @entity9 call for austerity and growth led by trade with countries outside the @entity15			0
but it is not clear that the eurozone can sustain the social and political pain of austerity long enough and on the scale necessary to eventually achieve competitive parity with @entity9			1
the alternative is for @entity9 to revert to the deutsche mark			0
that would immediately result in appreciation of the @entity9 currency and competitive devaluation of the euro for the remaining eurozone countries			1
@entity9 would tend to buy more while selling less , and vice versa for the rest of the eurozone			0
the extra consumption that @entity9 will not deliver via stimulus policies would be automatically delivered by currency revaluation			0
the single most essential element of a euro rescue has always been one form or another of a euro bond guaranteed jointly by all eurozone member countries			1
what the @entity122 bond is to the @entity82 economy , the euro bond would be to the @entity15			0
the main obstacle has been @entity9 's insistence that it would not guarantee payments on bonds for the benefit of other @entity1 countries			1
@entity9 reversion to the deutsche mark would remove this obstacle , and with no further @entity9 opposition , the remainder of the eurozone could move ahead to establish a true euro bond , along with a unified treasury function to match the unified banking function of the @entity139			1
some may object that @entity9 backing would still be required for the eurozone and a euro bond to be viable			2
that is correct , and @entity9 would indeed remain committed to the eurozone for a number of reasons			0
it would need the eurozone more than ever to buy its increasingly expensive exports			0
the @entity149 ( @entity9 's central bank ) would undoubtedly sell deutsche marks against euros to mitigate appreciation , and the resulting accumulation of euros would be invested in the new euro bonds			1
this in turn might inspire the @entity139 to initiate quantitative easing programs that would stimulate the entire @entity15 economy			0
the cost to @entity9 of saving @entity1 will be a hit to exports and perhaps a temporary rise in unemployment , but a return to the deutsche mark would attract a flood of capital to @entity9 and thereby spur investment while holding interest rates and inflation down			0
the real question is whether the cost of slower export growth and increased unemployment is less than that of paying for @entity2 , then @entity20 , etc. somehow , the " unknown " risks of a @entity9 exit from the euro appear more manageable , more quantifiable and in some ways more familiar a challenge than endless austerity , social unrest and political polarization .			1

**writers** : to *salvage* eurozone , @entity9 , not @entity2 , should withdraw
they say @entity9 is very competitive ; eurozone countries unable to catch up
they say @entity9 could *improve* its currency valuation , stop *preventing* euro bonds
**writers** : euro bonds could help with euro rescue ; pain for @entity9 would be temporary
