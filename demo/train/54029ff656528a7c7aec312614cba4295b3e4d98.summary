@entity0 , @entity1 -- attorney @entity3 has a lifetime of experience when it comes to the legal battles that ensue following major oil catastrophes			1
after the @entity10 oil tanker crashed in @entity11 in 1989 , @entity3 headed straight to @entity12			1
the @entity1 - based attorney had an interest in environmental issues and wanted to help because , as he put it , " there were an awful lot of hurt people			1
" he soon represented 2,600 fishermen and others affected by the spill			2
what he thought would be a two - or three - year " adventure " is still the biggest thing on his plate , one - third of his life later			2
@entity3 successfully argued the 1994 trial after which a jury ordered @entity30 to pay $ 5.3 billion in punitive damages to @entity3 's clients and others affected by the spill			1
@entity30 appealed almost two dozen times and @entity3 was there through it all			1
in 2008 , the case reached the @entity38 @entity37 , where a 5 - 3 majority finally set punitive damages at $ 500 million			2
it was a significant blow to @entity3 and his clients			1
today , @entity3 is working to make sure each of his clients receives the remainder of their payments from @entity30 , which he expects will be complete by year end			1
@entity3 spoke with @entity2 in his downtown @entity0 office at the @entity50 law firm about the similarities between the @entity10 situation , and the current disaster in the @entity54			1
@entity2 : what are some of the key similarities you see between the two spills ? @entity3 : the noise and the feeling that you get now is the same as the noise and the feeling that you got in the early days of the @entity67 spill , with people saying the same thing and people reacting the same way			1
it 's going to be interesting when the limelight is no longer on the @entity54 as to how @entity74 is going to act and how the federal and state governments are going to act			2
because once this is no longer on the front page of the newspaper , everybody 's reaction is going to be ' we need oil			2
' oil runs the universe , and you can see governments settling with @entity74 relatively cheaply and you can see @entity74 at some point in time changing its attitude from ' we 'll pay you ' to ' we 'll pay you if the court tells us to pay you			0
' @entity2 : this week , @entity74 agreed to set aside a $ 20 billion escrow account to compensate @entity38 businesses and workers who have been adversely affected by the @entity54 oil spill			2
what are your thoughts on that ? @entity3 : i hope what it means is that they 're going to take $ 20 billion and set up a fund for victims and that you 'll go to the fund and that they 'll pay you interim money and then they 'll pay you final money			1
and for a lot of the plaintiffs , they may not need to ever go to court , so they 're not going to get tied up for 20 years			2
[ in that regard ] it would be really positive			0
if they 're successful in starting to move money quickly , it 'll be a huge success , but if they 're going to pay anywhere from 30,000 to 100,000 people , that 's awfully tricky			0
and it 's going to take a lot of work and a lot of money to set this thing up quickly , and it only works if you set it up quickly ... for a lot of these people who live from year to year on their fishing businesses , they could be bankrupt by the end of the year			0
so that 's what we have to do is we 've got to get money to them quickly			0
@entity2 : did anything surprise you once you started representing the fishermen and taking on @entity30 after the @entity67 spill ? @entity3 : i thought that -- like a lot of people think now with regard to @entity74 -- that @entity30 would want to settle the case relatively early and move on and i was surprised a number of times with the fact that this was @entity157 to them , and they dealt with it that way ... they spent over $ 400 million on lawyers , essentially defending [ against ] our claims			1
they took every appeal they could take and they took every delay they could take and filed every motion they could take			0
do n't kid yourself : the oil companies have the best lawyers money can buy			0
@entity2 : is that one of the most important things you think people in the @entity54 should keep in mind when thinking about filing a claim ? @entity3 : i think that they should -- if they have a claim -- file a claim with @entity74 and see if @entity74 will pay it			1
if @entity74 does n't pay it i think they ought to go to the federal oil spill fund and see if the oil spill fund will pay it , and then if they have to file suit with the knowledge that it 's gon na be a long haul ... make absolutely sure they 're not giving up any legal rights			1
the major problem they face other than the legal system is that they do n't know how hard they 've been hit yet			0
you could say to yourself , if you 're a shrimper , ' well i have n't fished for the last month			0
' but what happens if this toxic oil does something to that fishery ? or what happens if the presence of that toxic oil does something to the price of @entity54 shrimp around the world ? you 're not going to know the answer to some of those things for two or three or four years			2
so you have to settle part of your case now if you can ... because the scope of the harm to you is unknown			0
it 's as unknown as where that oil is going to go			0
@entity2 : you mentioned the legal system would be one of their biggest problems : can you elaborate on that ? @entity3 : well if a company is rich enough and powerful enough to hire hundreds of lawyers they can essentially bring the legal system to a halt			1
most of these fishermen no longer believe that the court system of the @entity38 provides equal justice			0
they 've come to a conclusion that is the same as the conclusion that i 've come to , and that is that our governmental institutions will always bail out big oil , and they did here			0
@entity2 : do you think oil still has that great of an influence today ? @entity3 : it 's more than the influence that oil has			1
it 's whoever controls oil rules the world			0
the fact that you came downtown in a car that needs oil [ and the fact that ] the electricity in the office is probably the result of oil are everyday reminders of the strategic importance of oil to the @entity38 , and if you 're a judge or you 're the president ... you 're aware of the fact that you need @entity74 and @entity30 , so why the heck would you punish @entity74 or @entity30 in any way that impairs their ability to survive ? you would n't , no matter how many people they hurt			0
@entity2 : do you have any regrets from this case ? @entity3 : i regret that i have n't done a lot of other professional things for the last 21 years , i do			1
it was never my plan to be a trial lawyer until i was 63 years old			2
i was going to go off and do something else , teach law school probably			0
but i did n't get the chance to do that so that 's my biggest regret			0
second regret is it 's hard on you emotionally , so then it 's hard on your family to always be worrying about the same thing all of the time			0
but we got through it ... i am proud of the work i 've done			0
i am not proud of the fact that i did n't make my clients whole			1
i had expected in 1989 that in the end of the day , everybody would be fully compensated for their losses , and they were n't			1
and that 's in part my fault			0
so while i 'm proud i lasted 21 years , the result was not what my clients deserved .			1

after the 1989 @entity306 , attorney @entity3 headed to @entity12
@entity3 thought he would be representing victims of the spill for three or four years
today , 21 years later , he is still working to make sure his clients are fully compensated
