-- today is the 11th anniversary of the opening of the prison at @entity4 in @entity5 , and like the past three anniversaries , it comes with president @entity9 's campaign promises to close it unmet			1
from day 1 , the story of @entity4 , or @entity4 as it came to be called , has been one of injustice and illegality , the violation of human rights and a stain on @entity19 's global reputation			2
locked within its walls are the stories of hundreds of men who have lost years -- and , for nine of those men , their lives			1
in 2013 , the story of @entity4 is not just one of the failure to close the prison after so much time but also one of pragmatic failure of missed opportunities to take available , practical steps to reduce the prison 's population			1
eighty - six of the men still languishing at @entity4 were cleared for release in 2009 by an interagency task force created by the @entity9 administration			1
they remain there because @entity9 chooses , at every turn , to acquiesce to an intransigent @entity44 that is bent on keeping @entity4 open for its own cynical political purposes			1
this is particularly tragic because several countries have plans to help former @entity4 prisoners reintegrate into society and have asked that their citizens be returned			2
for those prisoners who can not go home because they face persecution or torture , there are third - party countries in @entity58 , the @entity59 and the @entity60 that have volunteered to accept former @entity4 prisoners for resettlement			2
many of the 86 men cleared for release are ideal candidates for these repatriation or resettlement options			1
among them is @entity69 client @entity68 -- cleared for transfer by presidents @entity71 and @entity9			1
he is educated , speaks four languages and has lived and worked legally in @entity73 and @entity74			0
inexplicably , the @entity19 has refused offers from foreign governments to resettle him or to take other similar opportunities to reduce the prison population			0
one of the biggest obstacles to closing @entity4 is one the president created himself : a blanket refusal to transfer any prisoner to @entity84 because of the " unsettled situation " there			0
apart from the fact that detention based on citizenship is discriminatory and illegal , concerns about returning people to unsettled countries does not explain why cleared @entity84 at @entity4 can not be temporarily resettled in third countries			1
more fundamentally , birthplace is not an indicator of criminal proclivity			0
if they were treated rationally , as individuals , rather maligned as a group , the government would surely concede at least some men at @entity4 could go home to @entity84 and not become threats to the @entity19 -- not least of all because most of these men , according to leaked @entity19 documents , were never involved in hostilities of any kind , and more than half have long been deemed suitable for transfer by every relevant @entity19 national security agency			2
this collective punishment is particularly troublesome given the stakes			0
in september 2012 , @entity111 , who was cleared for release , died in his cell			2
according to conversations with dozens of other @entity4 attorneys , there are many other detainees at the prison who are gravely ill. how many more will live out their remaining days behinds bars merely because @entity9 has deemed @entity84 an unsuitable place ? the @entity69 represents several clients who we hope will be spared such a fate			1
@entity124 has maintained a hunger strike to protest his unjust detention since 2007 and is force - fed by the military through his nose			0
@entity129 and @entity129 are suffering the inevitable psychological and physical effects of more than a decade of indefinite detention			1
none of these three men has ever been charged			0
finally , @entity9 has made no effort toward solving the central , inherent @entity4 problem : indefinite detention			1
in addition to the dozens of men subject to de facto indefinite detention , 46 are officially slated to that fate			1
two of the initial 48 have died			0
according to the president , the @entity19 can neither charge and try the 46 men , nor can they be released			0
such a category violates the most fundamental principles of due process , summarily depriving people of their freedom by way of executive fiat			0
@entity9 has created this category without any plan for how to move men out of it			2
we are simply warehousing them			0
do we plan to operate a prison at @entity4 for the next several decades , holding these men as they age and die , outlasting the logistical problem even as we ignore -- and worsen -- the moral and constitutional one ? what the president lacks is not the political power to act , but the political will			2
interim steps are critical to closing the prison			0
indeed , without them , it is hard to see how his promise to close it can ever be achieved -- and even more difficult to believe that @entity9 is truly committed to a world without @entity4			1
as @entity9 stands again to take the presidential oath to protect and defend the @entity172 , looming behind him will be his institutionalized policy of indefinite detention without charge or trial -- a policy that has no place in a democratic society			1
unless and until he uses the political power of his office to end this shameful chapter in @entity19 history , the story of @entity4 will be one with no end in sight			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			0

@entity188 : another @entity4 anniversary , the 11th , comes with vows to close it unmet
@entity188 : hundreds of locked up men have lost years of their lives ; nine have died
86 were cleared for release in 2009 but languish there as @entity9 does nothing , he says
@entity188 : 48 are under unjust , illegal policy of indefinite detention without charge or trial
