-- @entity1 recently had a great opportunity to pick up a nice present for his 3 - year - old nephew			2
the @entity5 running back went up to @entity7 after a game and asked for his autograph			2
well , that kind of blew up in his face			2
here he was , just trying to do a nice thing for a child , and people get all crazy upset , just because @entity7 plays on the other team			2
in a sign of the times , @entity1 even felt it necessary to apologize on @entity20			2
here 's hoping that if you go out to get a sports memorabilia gift this holiday season you deal with a lot less criticism			1
but you might feel some heat			2
after all , there are some cool items , but they can be pricey , especially if someone like @entity7 signs his name to them			2
we 'll help you sort through the many sites that sell sports items and point you toward a few things we might even include on our wish list			1
it 's understandable why @entity1 's nephew wanted @entity7 's signature			0
he 's one of the hottest athletes in the country right now , likely leading @entity41 to the @entity43 playoffs			0
if you hunt around the internet , you can find several sites selling a jersey , even one selling one he wore during his college career			0
the most popular jersey would be the one he wears now , no. 7 for the @entity50			0
or you could go for the autographed @entity50 ' jersey			1
that one is $ 592 at @entity53			1
or you could save a little coin and get one from the @entity55 ( the team he played for until he went to prison for his role in a deadly dogfighting operation ) for the sale price of $ 125			1
want a less controversial quarterback ? @entity65 's @entity64 top is $ 760 in blue and $ 1,049 in white			1
if the person you are buying for digs historical baseball moments , he or she might like a ball autographed by pitcher @entity72 and the umpire who cost him his perfect game , @entity73			1
the grace each showed after @entity77 's blown call is an example of sportsmanship most fans will talk about for years			0
one ball , $ 573			1
it 's a souvenir commemorating a moment that had n't happened before and probably wo n't again			0
while neither of those men seem likely candidates for the @entity88 , @entity84 is one of the all - time greats and is part of the 2011 class that will be enshrined in @entity88			0
he was widely admired by all baseball fans during his 21 - year career			1
you can get an autographed @entity96 replica jersey at @entity97 for $ 259			1
( you 'll have to pay extra to get it in a frame			0
) one of the most exciting moments of the sports year -- at least for @entity104 soccer fans and even bandwagon fans -- came at the @entity106 , when in its final group game the @entity104 needed a goal to move into the prestigious round of 16			1
all - time leading scorer @entity110 pounced in the last minute , sending bars and offices across the country into scenes of pandemonium			0
@entity116 has a few autographed photos of @entity110 and his teammates celebrating what is one of the signature moments in @entity104 men 's soccer history for $ 263			1
hockey fans will long remember the exciting @entity126 men 's final , won by @entity127 when @entity128 scored in overtime			0
@entity130 has some @entity132 jerseys , including one signed by @entity133 ( $ 229 )			1
if you want one , bid soon , as that auction ends monday			0
@entity137 fans are fiercely loyal			0
but if you are giving to someone and you do n't know who his or her favorite driver is , you probably ca n't go wrong with a @entity142 die cast			0
@entity142 won his fifth consecutive championship this season and die casts are cool small - scale replicas of the cars used in races			0
if you go to @entity142 's @entity152 's site , there are many cars to choose from , including cars from previous years and cars with the various color schemes used throughout the year			0
want something that might make a cool addition to the home office or the man cave ? consider seats from stadiums that met their demise			0
for instance a pair of seats from old @entity167 will cost you $ 1,500 at @entity169			1
@entity170 also has seats ( or parts ) from the @entity173 and @entity174			0
but let 's go big			0
say you have a blank check , and the fan who has almost everything			0
well , @entity180 collectibles are some of the most sought after sports items on the planet			1
@entity183 offers five bats from the @entity180 at $ 125,253 ( and 50 cents )			1
they were used in games at the time he was being sold from the @entity188 to the @entity189 and making the transition from pitcher to right field			0
if that price is too steep , the company offers a store model bat for just $ 964			1
still too much ? they also have a @entity180 card by @entity198 from 2009 for $ 17			1
while we 're at it , everyone loves a good sports movie			1
look how much bank the film " @entity206 " took in at the box office			0
so , while it may not qualify specifically as " sports " memorabilia , you could also buy a prop or costume from the hit film			1
@entity214 in @entity215 , @entity216 , offers more than 100 items from the film , including a green @entity220 jersey worn by @entity221 for $ 799.99			2
his stunt double 's uniform is just $ 599			2
other items range from $ 14.99 to $ 1,599 .			2

sports *paraphernalia* is more than just the @entity198 baseball card these days
you can buy autographed jerseys , photos , even costumes from sports films
if you have the cash , you can have your own @entity180 bat for around $ *126,000*
