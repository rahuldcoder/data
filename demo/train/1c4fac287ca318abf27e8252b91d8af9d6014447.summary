the perpetually packed @entity9 in @entity10 is known for its beehive julep and champagne cocktails			1
the @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 the 1920s scene at legendary watering holes like the @entity18 and @entity19 of @entity20 inspired this cavernous lounge , where current industry players mingle in their best vintage cocktail dresses and blazers			1

the @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 luxurious floor - to - ceiling velvet curtains create intimate spaces inside the @entity40 , discreetly hidden behind an unmarked , wood - paneled door			1
circles of high - backed leather chairs and the warm glow from crystal chandeliers and working fireplaces encourage conversation			2

a favorite is the @entity63 and @entity64 , @entity66 gin with mint , cucumber and rosewater ( $ 12 )			2
@entity0 gallery : see the bars @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 look for the pharmacy cross marking the entrance to @entity77 , short for apothecary -- a place where ingredients like gin and bitters were put to medicinal use way before the cocktail was born			2

chandeliers hang among exposed pipes over the perpetually packed bar , known for champagne cocktails and beehive juleps ( $ 10.50 )			1
@entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 this funky 1800s brick house was a speakeasy during the ' 20s , and it feels like not much has changed since then , as evidenced by the well - used jazz piano and the secret room hidden behind a two - way mirror			1
bartenders measure ingredients on scales to ensure exact proportions go into cocktails ( $ 15 ) made with throwback mixers like frothy egg whites , fresh - brewed bitters and homemade ginger soda			1
@entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 with custom - made chandeliers above the cherry wood bar and jazz and swing played on the piano , @entity170 gives the impression of being like any other roaring ' 20s - themed jazz club			1

@entity188 magician @entity187 escapes from a straitjacket while hanging upside down from the ceiling , a feat best appreciated while sipping a multilayered " magic " martini of @entity194 liqueur , @entity196 raspberry vodka , pineapple juice and @entity198 ( $ 12 )			0

that decadent ambience is re-created at this supper club , which has dark wood booths , art deco red - velvet chairs and ornate @entity216 rugs			0
