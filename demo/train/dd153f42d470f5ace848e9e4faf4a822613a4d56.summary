-- in the fight against @entity3 , @entity1 has said : no thanks			1
immigration minister @entity5 announced " strong controls " on arrivals from @entity8 countries affected by cases of the deadly disease			1
telling @entity1 's parliament during a question time session monday that his ministry was currently " not processing any application from these ( @entity3 ) affected countries , " he said that the government was also suspending its humanitarian program			1
he added that holders of permanent @entity1 visas based in these countries would be subject to a mandatory , three - week quarantine process prior to their departure			1
visitors approved to travel to @entity1 will also face further screening and followup checks upon arrival			2
the announcement came as a " surprise , " the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) president @entity29 told @entity0 , who said that the chance of the disease entering the country through a migrant from the region was very low			2
" it 's not necessarily a very well - focused decision			0
the bigger picture needs to be on our preparedness at home but more importantly our involvement in @entity8 itself , putting doctors and nurses and other logistical elements in place and trying to combat the crisis there			2
" he added that the government had sought the advice of " very few people , " and had excluded the @entity30			0
@entity1 prime minister @entity56 said : " i not always agree with the @entity30 , but i take them seriously and i think that the @entity30 invariably has the national interest at heart			2
" the announcement that no refugees will be accepted from @entity8 must be overturned , the @entity60 have said			2
" while the government drags its feet in responding to the @entity3 crisis , @entity5 has slammed the door on @entity8 refugees , " the @entity60 ' immigration spokesperson , senator @entity63 said			1
" the immigration minister 's crusade against those in need has spread to @entity8 and is simply unacceptable			0
" this miserly , selfish and cruel announcement from the government is not a reflection of our nation 's character			0
" ' make advice public ' the main opposition party called on the government to make the advice that informed its policy public			0
" we want the government to release the advice on which this decision has been made , " @entity83 's foreign affairs spokesman @entity82 said			0
" we need to be absolutely certain that this government is n't being tough but dumb when it comes to protecting @entity1 from the risk of @entity3 infection at home , " @entity82 was quoted by the @entity86 as saying			1
former @entity92 secretary - general @entity91 told @entity0 's @entity93 that isolationism was not the answer to the current health crisis			0
" the doctors from ( the ) @entity98 , to the @entity99 here and other countries have indicated that the worst thing you want to do is close off the borders and come up with this sort of restrictions and scare away potential help , " he said			0
" our concern should be with the public safety and public health but we have to accept that the only way we can deal with it in the medium to long term is to stop the epidemic			0
" concerns are being raised that the @entity1 response is largely engineered to create political capital , particularly given the country 's well - documented hard line on immigration			2
" there have been people here in @entity1 that have been asking for this kind of approach and i think the main drive is political , " @entity29 said			0
" of course it will always be dressed up as a solution to keeping @entity1 safe but in actual fact the people who are coming from @entity8 , a number of them are coming on humanitarian grounds so there are concerns about why their visas are being denied , and for what period of time they 'll be denied for			1
" the nonprofit @entity138 , also known as @entity139 , echoed the sentiment , saying that " developed countries ' prevention strategies ... seem to have more political than medical implications			0
