@entity0 , whose roller - coaster , nine - decade career in show business included vaudeville , silent films , movies , television and @entity8 , died sunday			1
@entity11 died in @entity12 , the @entity10 's office said			1
@entity11 's career spanned almost the entire history of motion pictures			1
he made his first film , the silent " not to be trusted , " in 1926 and followed it up with several shorts based on the " @entity20 " comic strip			2
he was still making movies nine decades later , including " @entity22 " ( 2006 ) and " the @entity23 " ( 2011 )			2
at the time of his death , he had three more films in the works , according to the @entity28 , including a version of " @entity30 " with @entity31			2
@entity11 had just completed his last movie role in the next installment of " @entity22 " with @entity34			1
" he led a full life but did not have enough time to finish all he had planned to do			2
he had the time of his life and the utmost respect for the cast and crew , " his son @entity37 said in a statement to @entity39 monday			2
he separated from his wife , @entity46 , two years ago and moved in with his son and his wife , @entity48 , according to the statement			2
" with them he finally found happiness , health and a feeling of safety and was able to enjoy life again			2
" " @entity0 was finally enjoying life as a bachelor , and the morning of his death , they spoke of all their future plans , " the statement said			1
" he loved the business he was in and had a great respect for his fellow actors			2
" for a period in the 1930s and 1940s , boosted by the popularity of the " @entity68 " series of films , @entity11 was the no. 1 star at the box office and perhaps the brightest star at @entity71 -- a whole studio of " more stars than there are in heaven , " as the publicity said			1
yet he became as famous for many marriages -- eight , all told -- and his regular tumbles off the @entity80 pedestal as he was for his incredible energy and longevity			2
still , he never stopped getting up			0
" i keep going because if you stop , you stop , " he told the @entity85 's @entity84 newspaper in 2009			0
" why retire ? @entity87			0

he was born @entity94 on september 23 , 1920 , in @entity95 , @entity96			0
his parents split when he was young , but spurred by his mother , he soon found himself in @entity80			0
before he was 10 , he was a star , appearing in dozens of shorts based on the popular " @entity20 " strip			2
he worked steadily through the 1930s , with notable turns in a 1935 version of " @entity103 " and 1937 's " @entity104 , " the latter opposite @entity105			0
( @entity11 also appeared in @entity105 's 1938 vehicle " @entity107			1
" ) but he shot into @entity80 's stratosphere in his next film series as @entity68 in more than a dozen films produced between 1937 and 1946			0
@entity68 was a good - hearted ball of teenage mischief , always trying to make a few dollars or willing to " put on a show , " no matter what it took : rounding up friends , using a barn , getting some spare parts from his wholesome middle - @entity120 neighborhood			2
inevitably , he would be called to account with his father , judge @entity68 , played at first by @entity122 and later by @entity123			0
judge @entity68 would reiterate the basics of fairness and morality , and @entity68 -- and the movie audience -- would have once again learned a valuable lesson			0
the films were hugely popular , even more so when @entity11 's character became the centerpiece starting with 1938 's " @entity132			1
" it did n't hurt that @entity11 was paired with @entity134 for three of the films			1

as an adult of a certain size , @entity11 found it much harder to find roles into which he could channel his prodigious talents			1
