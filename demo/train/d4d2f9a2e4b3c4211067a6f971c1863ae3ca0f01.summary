-- while all about him were losing their heads , @entity1 kept his cool			2
in a week when grand slam champions have been falling like flies at the @entity8 , the old master survived a fourth - set fightback to defeat world no. 4 @entity10 6 - 3 6 - 4 6 - 7 ( 6 - 8 ) 6 - 3			1
@entity1 's win means he advances to the last four in @entity13 for the 11th year in a row , with his archrival @entity16 standing between him and a sixth final			1
top seed @entity16 had beaten @entity20 's @entity19 earlier on wednesday to continue his bid for a 14th grand slam title			1
@entity1 and @entity16 met in the semifinals two years ago , the latter emerging victorious , while the @entity25 holds a 22 - 10 winning record over the @entity28 star having won the last four matches between them			1
" he 's been tough to play against , no doubt , " @entity1 told reporters when asked about @entity16			1
" i 'm happy i get a chance to play him in a grand slam again			1
i do n't remember the last time we played			0
" @entity1 recently recruited six - time grand slam winner @entity38 to his coaching team , with the @entity41 set to spent 10 weeks working with the former world no. 1 throughout the season			1
with @entity38 now onside , @entity1 is hoping he can reverse his fortunes against @entity16			1
" the head - to - head record is in his favor , " the 32 - year - old told reporters			2
" i 'm looking forward to speaking to @entity38 , because when we spoke together , you know , when he came to @entity49 and we spoke about the game , we clearly spoke about playing @entity16 , as well			2
" he thought he had some good ideas , so i 'm looking forward to what he has to say			0
" @entity16 narrowly avoided joining second seed @entity55 -- beaten by @entity1 's compatriot @entity56 on tuesday -- on the sidelines , eventually overcoming @entity19 , the @entity20 's cheering section and a nasty blister on the @entity25 's left palm			1
the world @entity61 prevailed 3 - 6 7 - 6 7 - 6 6 - 2 , saving three set points in the third set			0
" i was so lucky , " @entity16 said in an on - court interview			2
" i felt anything could happen in the third set			0
" a lot of @entity20 here today			0
thanks everyone for supporting -- it was a great atmosphere			0
i hope you enjoyed it			0
" @entity16 said the blister , which troubled him in the previous round , particularly affects him on serve and he duly struck three double faults in one game			2
but it was @entity19 -- the man , now to his dismay , still being compared to @entity1 because of their similar styles -- who faltered on the key points			1
he missed a makeable forehand and return on two of his three set points in the third			0
his backers were frequently out of their chairs chanting his name throughout the three - and - a - half - hour encounter , prompting one fan to counter , " shut up and sit down			0
" @entity19 left the court in tears and then became emotional when speaking to reporters			0
" it should hurt , and it does hurt , " said the @entity20 .			0
