an audio recording purportedly from the @entity1 promises more fighting in more @entity4 cities , including @entity5			1
" continue your march as the battle is not yet raging , " a voice said to be that of @entity1 spokesman @entity7 says on the message posted early thursday ( last wednesday night @entity13 ) on the group 's media website			2
" it will rage in @entity5 and @entity17			0
so be ready for it			0
" @entity19 can not confirm the authenticity of the audio or time and date of its recording , which is nearly 17 minutes long			0
" do n't give up a hand 's width of ground you 've liberated , " the voice says in apparent encouragement of @entity1 fighters			0
the message , if authentic , is further proof that the militant group are not content with control of the places they have already taken over -- and are setting their sights higher			0
open to @entity39 strikes on wednesday , @entity4 's government indicated a willingness for the @entity39 military to conduct airstrikes against the radical @entity45 militants			1
several @entity39 officials said @entity47 views the situation as " extremely urgent " and is looking to see what more support the @entity39 can provide to the @entity4 government , in addition to weapons and vehicles it has already provided			1
part of this will be giving @entity4 officals intelligence they can use to go going after @entity1			1
assistance could also involve training and " kinetic " activity , @entity39 officials told @entity19 , but they would n't specify whether those options included airstrikes			1
@entity5 's openness to airstrikes was first reported by the @entity67 on wednesday night			0
one of the officials said there clearly was a breakdown in @entity4 security , but @entity47 believes it was a combination of factors , including the fact that @entity4 forces were already stretched thin by limited success against @entity1 in @entity78 province			2
government forces in the northern cities of @entity82 and @entity83 ran when attacked this week , the officials said			1
one silver lining , the officials said , is that @entity4 officials now seem to have a coordinated approach with the semiautonomous @entity89 regional government			2
it appears @entity4 forces will team up with @entity89 fighters , known as the @entity92 , to fight militants with @entity1 , an offshoot of @entity95			1
@entity92 forces took up positions in southwest @entity100 after militants took over several villages and districts north and west of the city and the @entity4 army withdrew , police officials there told @entity19			1
the @entity107 on wednesday updated its travel warning to @entity4 , saying terrorist activity and violence is at " levels unseen since 2007			1
" it has warned against all but essential travel to the country			0
rapid takeovers a day after taking over @entity82 , @entity4 's second - largest city , @entity1 militants gained nearly complete control of the northern city of @entity83 , witnesses in the city and police officials in neighboring @entity119 told @entity19			1
heavy fighting erupted inside @entity83 -- the hometown of former @entity4 leader @entity126 -- as the military tried to regain control , the sources and a police official in @entity5 said			1
according to the witnesses in @entity83 and the @entity119 police officials , two police stations in @entity83 were on fire and a military base was taken over by militants			1
the governor of @entity137 province , of which @entity83 is the capital , was missing , according to the sources			2
suspected @entity1 militants raided the @entity140 consulate in @entity82 on wednesday , capturing 48 people , including diplomats , and they also seized parts of @entity144 , the site of @entity4 's largest oil refinery , police officials in @entity83 told @entity19			1
the devastating @entity1 advance is proving an object lesson of much that is wrong in @entity4 and the region -- with a festering civil war over the border in @entity153 adding fuel to the growing sectarian tensions at home			2
@entity1 is exploiting this to expand its influence , from cities like @entity160 and parts of @entity162 that it wrested from the government in @entity78 early this year , and from @entity153 towns like @entity166 it controls over the border			0
that it is capable of fighting the forces of @entity153 president @entity170 on one hand , its fellow radicals on another and the @entity4 government on top of that is an indication of the depth to which @entity1 has established itself in the region			1
militants were responsible for the deaths of many @entity39 troops in western @entity4			1
with @entity39 help , @entity4 tribal militias put @entity1 on the defensive			1
but when @entity39 troops left the country , the extremist militants found new leadership , grew stronger while in @entity153 , and returned to @entity4 , making military gains often off the backs of foreign fighters drawn to @entity153 's conflict			1
half million civilians displaced the clashes across @entity4 come on the heels of a sudden and danger - fraught exodus from the fighting in @entity82 , which fell to militants tuesday			1
more than 500,000 people have fled the fighting there , the @entity201 said wednesday			1
the group said there were many civilian casualties			0
the city 's four main hospitals are inaccessible because of fighting , and some mosques have been converted for use as clinics , the @entity201 said			2
those fleeing the fighting -- some on foot , some bringing only what they can carry in plastic bags -- were heading to the city 's east or seeking sanctuary elsewhere in @entity223 province or in @entity4 's @entity89 region			1
the @entity225 said many people were traveling with no belongings and little or no money			0
that including one family of 12 people , including a 70 - year - old grandmother , who had walked for two days from a farm near @entity82 to a checkpoint			1
they had no idea what they were going to do next , and they had spent all their cash , the @entity234 said			0
@entity82 , a predominantly @entity238 city with 1.6 million residents , collapsed swiftly			1
@entity39 - trained @entity4 forces ran in the face of the onslaught , leaving behind uniforms , weapons and armored vehicles			1
a @entity39 @entity247 official said @entity47 has provided $ 15 billion in training , weapons and equipment to the @entity4 government			1
the heavily armed radicals overran police stations , freed more than 1,000 prisoners from the city jail and took over the city 's international airport			0
prime minister @entity257 ordered that all military leaders who fled be court - martialed			0
the @entity260 said the air force killed a group of @entity1 militants along a highway leading south toward @entity119			2
the ministry also said it would push back the militants			0
" this is not the end , we are very confident that we will be able to correct the path and to overcome mistakes , " the ministry said on its website			0
the @entity273 said that military commanders have started deploying fighters from local @entity277 militias on the western outskirts of @entity279 to protect that city			0
@entity140 consulate targeted @entity140 special forces members , consulate workers and three children were among those detained and taken to the @entity1 headquarters following a raid on the @entity140 consulate in @entity82 on wednesday morning , @entity140 officials told @entity19			2
" the condition of the @entity140 citizens is fine , developments are being monitored , " the officials said			0
foreign minister @entity294 said consulate staff had been urged to leave this week , but the decision to evacuate was left up to individuals			0
" we were told that it would be more risky for our 48 people to go outside than to stay inside , " @entity294 said , speaking on @entity140 television			0
" if any harm is done to any of our citizens , it will not go unanswered			0
no one should test @entity140			0
" oil town under attack meanwhile , suspected @entity1 militants seized parts of @entity144 , a small @entity4 town in @entity137 province about 200 kilometers ( 125 miles ) north of the capital , @entity5 , police officials in @entity83 told @entity19			1
the @entity144 oil refinery is still under the control of @entity4 security forces , officials said			2
the fact that @entity1 forces are trying to take the town suggests a wider strategic aim besides oil			0
@entity144 sits on the main highway north from @entity5 to @entity82 that passes through rural areas in which @entity1 has much influence			2
for the government to reinforce its troops in @entity82 , it needs to drive them through @entity144			2
if @entity1 controls the town , the government 's task will be much harder			0
explosions struck three @entity277 areas in @entity5 , killing 25 people and injuring 56 , police officials told @entity19			0
the deadliest attack was in @entity335 , where a car bomb exploded near a funeral tent , killing 15 people , police said			0
discontent feeds violence in his weekly address to the nation wednesday , @entity257 described the assault on @entity82 as a " conspiracy " to destabilize the country and called on @entity4 to " stand as one united front			1
" shiite cleric @entity347 said in a statement wednesday that he is ready to form a " peace brigade " to work in coordination with the @entity4 government " to defend the holy places " of @entity353 and @entity354			2
but this brigade probably would be viewed by many as a resurgence of @entity347 's @entity358 , the powerful @entity277 militia that disbanded at the end of 2008			0
its formation could risk worsening the country 's underlying problem -- festering sectarian division			0
the country 's minority @entity238 population , which prospered under @entity126 , feels shut out by @entity257 's @entity277 majority - dominated government			0
a @entity39 counterterrorism official told @entity19 that @entity1 had been active in @entity371 " for a long time and clearly sensed that @entity82 was vulnerable now after engaging in sporadic attacks earlier this year			1
" strategically , the group looks at @entity153 and @entity4 as one interchangeable battlefield , and its ability to shift resources and personnel across the border has measurably strengthened its position in both theaters			2
" however , the official said @entity1 still " has shown little ability to govern effectively , is generally unpopular and has no sway outside the @entity238 community in either @entity4 or @entity153			2
" a spokeswoman for the @entity387 said the fall of @entity82 and the situation in @entity83 validates neighboring @entity391 's concerns			1
" the @entity392 of @entity393 had earlier warned that the danger of terrorism wo n't be limited to one region and will spread beyond countries			0
and unfortunately today we are witnessing this issue , " @entity398 told the semiofficial @entity400 news agency			0
the siege of @entity82 : what 's happening ? why is it significant ? how @entity1 and @entity4 upheaval threatens the wider world			1

@entity39 updates travel warning , saying violence in @entity4 is at 2007 levels
