@entity0 -- sen. @entity3 got to work on health care reform within days of her arrival at the @entity6 as first lady in 1993 , newly released documents show			1
the @entity8 on wednesday released 11,000 pages of @entity3 's schedule as first lady			1
her first meeting on the subject came on january 23 , 1993 , only three days after her husband @entity14 's inauguration as president , and dozens of related events followed			1
despite her efforts , the @entity14 health care reform foundered in @entity19			1
the @entity8 on wednesday released more than 11,000 pages of sen. @entity3 's schedule when she was first lady			1
sen. @entity21 's campaign pushed for the documents ' release , arguing that their review is necessary to make a full evaluation of @entity14 's experience as first lady			1
the documents cover nearly 2,900 days			1
an additional 27 days will be posted in the near future , the archives said			0
the documents are among those at the center of a legal battle between the archives and @entity36 , a conservative public interest group that has long urged a speedier release of files from the @entity40 years			2
@entity41 , president of @entity36 , said the trove of documents " shows she was a co-president , " revealing an " extraordinary extent of meetings for an unelected official to be meeting with cabinet officials			0
" in a court motion this month , the archives promised to release the schedules by the end of the month but said it will need " one to two years " to process remaining documents , including more than 20,000 pages of call logs -- well after the november 4 presidential election			0
according to the archives statement , 4,746 of the schedules have redactions , information removed before being released , that largely relate to privacy concerns including @entity63 and telephone numbers and home addresses			0
" we 'll look them over , and may ask the court for relief if it looks like something important is missing , " @entity41 said of the redacted information			0
he said @entity36 continues to demand phone logs from @entity14 's time in the @entity6			2
the papers show @entity3 had no public schedule on the day independent counsel @entity76 was appointed to investigate @entity14 's affair with @entity78 , or on the day @entity14 was deposed in the case			1
on the day the affair began , @entity3 had a private meeting and a meet - and - greet with then - vice - president @entity83 and @entity84 winners			0
she kept up a busy schedule as the affair spiraled into impeachment			0
some events on the schedule might prompt a chuckle , such as a note on the day when the @entity92 voted to impeach @entity14 over the @entity78 affair that a holiday party dance between the president and first lady was " optional			2
" the documents are from the files of @entity101 , director of @entity14 's scheduling as first lady , the archives said in a statement			1
@entity104 stepped down as @entity14 's presidential campaign manager in february after a string of poor showings in primaries			2
" arranged chronologically , these records document in detail the activities of the first lady , including meetings , trips , speaking engagements and social activities for the eight years of the @entity14 administration , " the archives said			2
the records were simultaneously released on @entity120 at the @entity121 in @entity122 , @entity123 , and at the archives in @entity0			0
the documents will be available for view on the @entity121 's web site			0
