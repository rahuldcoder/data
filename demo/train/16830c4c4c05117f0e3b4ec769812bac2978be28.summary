-- what happens to the bar of soap you barely used the last time you checked into a hotel room ? most certainly it 's gone to waste at the end of each day			2
this was a shocking revelation for @entity14 humanitarian and social entrepreneur @entity12 during his first stay in a @entity17 hotel in @entity18 , @entity19 in the early 1990s			1
" when i checked into the hotel , there were 3 bars of soap - there was body soap , hand soap and face soap and that did not include the shampoos - and so for me that was a new experience , i was thinking to my self , " why do they have soap for every part of their bodies ? " @entity12 recalls			1
" now , my goodness , why would you throw away such a resource ? " the striking realization stayed with @entity12 , a @entity14 native who spent much of his childhood as a refugee in @entity43 , and prompted him years later to create the @entity44			1
the non-profit organization reprocesses used soaps from hotels around the @entity17 and turns them into new bars for impoverished nations such as @entity14 , @entity43 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
@entity12 says an estimated 2.6 million bars of soap are discarded every day from hotels in the @entity17 -- collecting such an enormous amount of soap , he notes , can help poor countries fight disease and combat child mortality by improving access to basic sanitation			1
" we have more than two million kids that die every year to lower respiratory diseases like diarrhea , " says @entity12			1
" if you are able to put a bar of soap in every child 's hand , you are able to reduce infectious diseases like diarrhea and things like typhoid and cholera by 40 %			2
" so the intervention became immediate for me and that 's when i thought we have a solution for kids in @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 that die every year			0
" based in @entity85 , @entity12 started the @entity44 in 2009 by going door to door , pitching his lifesaving idea to local hotels			1
so far , some 300 hotels across the @entity17 have joined @entity12 's cause , enabling him and his team to reprocess thousands of soap bars and ship them to 18 developing countries			1
the recycled soap is only released for shipment once a sample is tested for pathogens and deemed safe by a third - party laboratory			0
the @entity44 then works with partner organizations to ship and distribute the soap directly to people who need it for free			1
last summer , @entity12 personally delivered 5,000 bars to @entity106 , @entity107 's home of @entity109 orphanage			1
" when i took the soap to the orphans and they smelled the bar of soap , ah , you could see the joy -- those little messages of hope is what people need when they are between a rock and a hard place , " he says			0
the son of a soap maker , @entity12 has experienced what it is like to live in tough conditions			1
his happy early childhood in the 1970s was suddenly brought to an end after @entity14 's president @entity129 waged war against @entity131			1
@entity12 and his parents soon fled to neighboring @entity43 to escape the horrors of conflict and witnessed first hand the struggle to survive without access to basic necessities			2
" when you have come from a home that you knew , you 're used to your food , your friends ... to move from that to become a nobody and to literally be called a refugee is as dramatic as it gets			0
" he got a new chance in life through education , first in @entity150 and then in the @entity17			0
today , he runs the @entity44 from a warehouse in @entity85 , with the help of volunteers from all across the @entity17 , determined to improve the quality of lives in the developing world			2
" when i was a refugee , a pen pal letter was all i needed to get through the day , " he recalls			0
" if the bar of soap is going to help them get through the day then good , but our final goal is to change behavior and make sure they wash up and to stop diseases like diarrhea from infecting people and killing people -- that is our ultimate goal , we have yet to achieve that			0
" last year , @entity12 was a top 10 finalist for the @entity172 award			1
the recognition , he says , has boosted the popularity of the @entity44 , helping him and his team to promote the cause for better sanitation			2
" we are seeing an up tick of the number of hotels that are registering with us , " he says			0
" we are seeing a lot of volunteers coming to work with us , so there is a lot of traffic happening right now for us and that is going to help us make more soap			0
" despite all the success , @entity12 is determined to continue dedicating time and effort in his cause			2
he says his goal for this year is to make a million bars of soap			0
" if you want to do big things and you want to bring big change then you have to be able to give in a big way , " he says			0
" it 's important to understand what this is about -- people coming together globally to connect the dots			0
" so i say ' travel , use the soap ' because that soap goes eventually to help refugees , orphans			0
this is not about @entity81 per se , it 's about the collective good as humans to solve problems and that 's what we are trying to do			0
