-- @entity1 , the cinematographer whose expert use of light and shadow on such films as " @entity6 " and " @entity7 " earned him the nickname " the @entity10 , " has died			1
@entity11 , president of the @entity12 , confirmed @entity1 ' death to @entity0			2
" @entity1 was one of the undisputed giants of the industry			2
he not only changed the way movies look , he changed the way the world looks at movies , " @entity11 said in a statement			0
" his work on ' @entity6 ' in 1972 and ' @entity23 ' in 1974 made everything we now accept as superlative cinematography possible			2
his influence over subsequent generations of artists will continue for all time			0
he will be sorely missed			0
" indeed , @entity1 ' handiwork helped set the tone for the 1970s " @entity38 " renaissance -- led by directors such as @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 -- and could have an incredible impact on his films			1
on " @entity6 " ( 1972 ) , @entity35 's epic gangster saga , @entity1 ' dimly photographed , almost sepia - colored rooms and bright outdoors scenes added both historical shading and ominous mood - setting to what was intended to be a quickie take on @entity48 's bestselling book			1
@entity51 's " @entity7 , " on the other hand , is a love letter to @entity50			2
there are few openings more thrilling than " @entity7 's , " which pairs @entity1 ' photography of the city with @entity58 's " @entity57			2
" " he adored @entity50			0
... he romanticized it all out of proportion , " @entity51 narrates , and the effect is transcendent			0
in a film such as " @entity63 " ( 1976 ) , @entity1 ' cinematography was a literal illustration of the battle between the forces of light -- note the almost painfully bright @entity70 newsroom -- and darkness , as in the scenes in which @entity73 meets @entity74 in the gloomy parking garage			1
@entity76 , the cinematographer for such @entity78 films as " @entity79 " ( 2011 ) and " @entity80 " ( 2010 ) , noted that @entity1 was among a group ( which included @entity76 's father , @entity82 ) that changed @entity84 cinema			1
my father 's peer group " made the most headway of anybody : @entity90 and @entity1 and @entity91 and @entity92			0
they came out of what was still pretty archaic , and they ( made the most of ) developing technology and color film , all the new tricks , " he told @entity0 in 2012			0
amazingly , @entity1 never won a competitive @entity100 and was nominated just twice , for @entity51 's " @entity101 " ( 1983 ) and @entity35 's " @entity102 " ( 1990 )			1
he was awarded an honorary @entity100 in 2009 for " unsurpassed mastery of light , shadow , color and motion			1
" he was a perfectionist who knew exactly what he wanted			0
" on every movie i shot , i maintained strict developing and printing control -- everything was printed on one light , " @entity1 told @entity112 magazine			1
" i lit and exposed things at the level i wanted to be perceived on the screen ; if you do n't do that , anyone can decide what your work is supposed to look like , and i never believed in giving the studios that kind of flexibility			0
" @entity1 ' other films included " @entity130 " ( 1973 ) , " @entity23 " ( 1974 ) , " @entity131 " ( 1974 ) , " @entity132 " ( 1977 ) and " @entity133 " ( 1988 )			1
