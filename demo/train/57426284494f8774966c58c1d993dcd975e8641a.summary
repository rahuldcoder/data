-- it is not easy to capture a man 's life in 152 minutes , let alone a life as illustrious and complex as @entity5 's			1
for @entity8 - born actor @entity7 , who played the @entity10 leader in the 2013 biopic " @entity5 : @entity13 , " the task was sure to feel herculean			1
" i could never really articulate what it felt like to play @entity5 properly in an interview , " he admits in a phone conversation with @entity0			2
though the actor is @entity20 , and physically bears little resemblance to the late @entity10 leader , @entity7 recalls the unexpectedly warm reception he received , particularly from extras on set -- many of whom were locals who lived through the apartheid era			1
" @entity10 is very embracing			0
even though i 'm not from @entity10 and was about to play @entity5 , they still gave me a lot of love , " he says			2
by the end of filming , many were even calling him " @entity5			2
" the experience , life - changing in many ways , was bound to feel odd			0
for @entity7 , the best way to capture not just the man but the feeling of playing him on film , was through music			1
next week will see the release of " @entity45 , " a tribute to @entity5 made up of songs written and produced by @entity7 himself , and performed by a mixture of @entity10 and @entity20 talent , including @entity50 , the @entity51 and @entity52			1
" there were various sensations i experienced ( playing @entity5 ) , and i could never give an answer i was satisfied with			1
i think this album represents that answer			0
it allows me to express the feelings of playing him , " says @entity7			1
the " @entity63 " actor describes the record as a " character album , " and hopes to produce similar projects for the many other roles he 's taken on over the years			1
in this respect , " @entity45 " is as much about his own journey as it is about @entity5 's			1
in the album 's title song -- the only one that @entity7 performs on -- he has a tongue - in - cheek lyric about the casting choice			1
" all the families showed me love , the people wished me well / the whole town wondering how @entity5 could be played by @entity83 , " he sings , referring to his breakout role in @entity81 's " the wire			1
" " it 's the thoughts i was thinking at the time of making that film			0
music is a good way to get closer to a character , closer to an actor			2
it describes the whole journey of playing @entity5			1
it 's better than any picture , any postcard , any script , any autograph from an actor , " he says			0
" i would love to hear a character album from @entity101 in ' @entity102 , ' " he admits			2
" just to understand what @entity101 was going through at the time of making that film , how he was feeling playing that character			2
what kind of music would that be ? what would it sound like ? that would be fascinating for me			0
" a link to his father for @entity7 , playing @entity5 had personal resonance as well , as filming for the role coincided with the death of his father			1
" i lost both men around the same time , " @entity7 confides			0
" @entity5 reminded me of my dad , and my dad reminded me of him			0
they were both massive symbols in my life			0
" @entity7 describes how his father , a @entity123 - born shop steward working out of @entity8 's @entity124 , fought for the rights of union workers at a time in @entity128 history when their plight was particularly arduous ( it was @entity130 's time in power , after all )			2
" he was always equating himself with @entity5 and people like @entity5 who were standing up for what they believed in , and i would always succumb to 30 - minute lectures about rights , " he recalls			0
he co-wrote the song " tree , " which features on the album and is performed by @entity139 artists @entity140 and @entity141 , partially as a tribute to his father			0
" somebody tell my father , that we are standing by his tree / and even though we miss him , we are glad that he 's set free , " the lyrics go			0
" that song is particularly moving to me , " says @entity7			0
" as much as i wrote it for my dad , it relates to @entity5 too , even more so now			0
" @entity7 's " @entity45 " is set for release on november 24			1

actor @entity7 releases his first album , " @entity45 " next week
it describes the sensation of playing @entity5 in film " @entity5 : @entity13 "
