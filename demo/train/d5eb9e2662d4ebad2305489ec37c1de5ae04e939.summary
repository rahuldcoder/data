@entity0 , @entity1 -- sometimes , a film is so powerful that it haunts you long after you 've left the theater			1
usually , it 's because of the weight of the message			1
the film haunting me is " @entity10			1
" and the message ? i 'll leave that to @entity13 to explain			2
@entity13 and her husband , @entity14 , are the subjects of the new movie , " @entity10			1
" the film is an adaptation of the 2006 book , " @entity10 : evolution of a game " by @entity22			1
it tells the incredible story of @entity25 , who went from being a homeless inner - city high school student whose father was dead and whose mother was a crack addict to a star lineman at the @entity31 -- eventually being selected by the @entity32 in the 2009 @entity34 draft			1
the @entity32 recently signed the 6 - 5 , 309 - pound @entity25 to a 5 - year , $ 13.8 million contract			2
this @entity36 is brought to us not just by @entity25 's talent , perseverance , and hard work but also by the fact that he was adopted by the @entity42			1
the white , wealthy @entity44 family not only fed and clothed @entity22 but also loved him as one of their own along with daughter @entity48 and son @entity14 the " @entity10 " is the no. 2 film in @entity51 , and the role of @entity13 is played to perfection by @entity54			1
still , some critics dismissed the film as hokey and condescending , with one calling it the latest chapter in @entity64 's " long , troubled history of well - meaning white paternalism , with poor black athletes finding success through white charity			1
" they missed the point			2
simply put , there 's a lot that any one of us can do to improve the life of our fellow man			1
and the fact that we do it is its own reward			2
" he had a much greater impact on our lives than we did on his life , " @entity13 said in a recent interview			1
" you have this child , and you bring him in , and you realize how fortunate you are , how you 're blessed to have family , you 're blessed to have your health			1
so much in life you take for granted			1
" there 's the message : so much in life you take for granted			1
we 've forgotten how lucky we are , because we 're busy cursing fate			2
we 've stopped being grateful for what we have , because we somehow find it more satisfying to complain about what we do n't			0
until we meet someone who has much less than we do			0
so much in life you take for granted			1
as @entity51 , we 've become victims of our own success			1
we 've strayed so far from the example of our immigrant parents and grandparents that we bear no resemblance to that model			0
weighed down by own bloated sense of entitlement and self - importance , we 've lost our appetite for competition and we prefer to talk instead about what we think we " deserve			0
" at the first sign of adversity , we play the victim , give up , or fall apart			0
with all the blessings that come with living in the world 's most remarkable country , still we complain			1
here in the @entity116 , thousands of students at the @entity115 turned out to protest a 32 percent fee increase			0
i wrote a column , expressing disappointment that these " brats " consider a publicized subsidized college education an entitlement and telling them to go get jobs if their education is that important to them			0
i heard back from many of their parents who , angrily rising to their children 's defense , informed me -- in incompatible narratives -- that either there were no jobs or their kids already had two of them			2
how about that ? @entity142 parents			0
apparently , in @entity1 , the apple does n't fall far from the tree			0
after a few days of that noise , i was ready for a movie where , in one of the more poignant scenes , a young man is given his own bedroom and remarks that he 's " never had one before			2
" not a room but a bed			0
in another scene , @entity22 is so grateful to be at @entity154 that he respectfully sits at the dining room table while the rest of the family plops down in front of the television			0
in another scene , he requests a driver 's license just so he can have something with his name on it			2
so much in life we take for granted			1
i saw the movie in a well - to - do suburb north of @entity0			0
the crowd cheered , laughed , and cried			0
when it was over , there were smiles all around			0
i wondered : for all we 've acquired , what have we lost -- and look to movies like this to replenish ? the scene about the bed made me want to run home and gather up every one of my kids ' toys and give them to @entity183			0
and , i tell you , the next time they ask for something they do n't need , they 're getting a paper route			0
or at least they would if they were n't a preschooler and a toddler			0
in one scene , @entity13 interrupts football practice to give @entity22 a helpful tip for a lineman -- treat the team like your family and protect the family			0
she tells the startled football coach : " you can thank me later			2
" treat yourself to a nice present this holiday season			0
you can thank me later			0
the opinions expressed by this commentary are solely those of @entity208			1

a new film , " @entity10 , " tells *inspirational* story of hope and caring , says @entity208
he says film points up how fortunate most @entity51 are
rather than appreciate their luck , many *wallow* in complaints about *obstacles* , he says
@entity208 : there 's so much in life that we take for granted
