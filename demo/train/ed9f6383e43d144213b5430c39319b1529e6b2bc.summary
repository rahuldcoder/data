-- do n't run , @entity1			1
nobody is saying the former secretary of state , @entity3 senator , @entity5 and @entity6 first lady , and @entity8 - trained attorney is not qualified for the @entity11			1
in fact , she may have one of the most impressive @entity14 © s to ever be submitted for the job			0
@entity16 has a breadth of experience that indicates she has every capability needed to be president of the @entity5			1
but it is time for @entity5 to move on			1
the first argument against another @entity16 candidacy is generational			1
baby boomers need to release their arthritic fingers from the torch of leadership and pass it off to another generation			0
@entity16 , @entity31 and @entity32 will have accounted for 24 years of the presidency by 2016 , which seems more than sufficient			1
@entity16 's election potentially extends boomer influence in a manner that risks creating a generation gap that further increases political disaffection among young voters			1
age is another important consideration , regardless of howls of outrage on this question by her supporters			1
@entity16 would be 69 when she raised her right hand for the oath of office			1
she would be the second - oldest person to become president -- younger than @entity52 by several months			0
the pressures of the @entity11 amplify the afflictions of time			0
arguably , an optimal president combines an earned wisdom and natural intellect with the residual energy of youth			0
no one does this by turning 70 during their first year as president , which would be @entity16 's status			1
how long can @entity1 wait ? although doctors pronounced her perfectly healthy after a recent scare with a blood clot on the brain , the probabilities of geriatric disease in office are very real for someone who might be 77 at the end of a second term			1
@entity52 's comportment during his last years suggests that he had already begun moving behind the veil of @entity78 's			0
an accumulation of years defines our range of capabilities , physically and intellectually , and the @entity85 as well as the nation need to confront the question of whether a person in their mid- 70s is the best to serve as president			0
the obvious answer is no. there is , nonetheless , no underestimating the cultural importance of the first female president and the glory it will bestow upon history 's grandest democracy			0
the @entity99 , too , will have an interest in being the political organization that gave the country its first female as well as @entity105 presidents			0
@entity16 , who is properly positioned with experience , has other challenges that impede her getting a chapter in future textbooks as the first woman in the @entity112			1
@entity5 is weary of limited political choices and dynasties			2
a second @entity16 presidency might culminate in 28 years of @entity16 - @entity31 control			2
we are , more than ever , a nation that desperately needs to renew itself with what is different and hopeful and visionary			0
unfortunately , there is too much that is predictable with a second @entity16 candidacy			2
no one needs a time machine to look into the future and see the grainy video in tv attack ads with a baritone voice rattling on about @entity129 or mumblings about how her husband enriched himself by accumulating a net worth of $ 55 million since leaving office			0
@entity1 on possible presidency : ' i 'm realistic ' " do n't the @entity85 have enough ? " the voice would ask			2
" and has n't @entity5 had enough of the @entity85 ? " in spite of the fact that @entity16 's accomplishments as secretary of state are significant , including diplomatic efforts that averted a war between @entity145 and @entity146 , she is likely to be forced to endure campaign onslaughts accusing her of character flaws for forgiving her husband 's indiscretions , which means the electorate probably has to endure at least some painful flashbacks			1
this is not , however , a recommendation to back away from a fight			0
@entity16 has proved that her political knuckles are toughened with gristle , and she can skillfully marginalize absurd allegations from her opponents			2
instead of running and winning a fierce campaign , there might be a more honorable endeavor for the former secretary of state			0
there is always a right moment to leave the stage , and failing to recognize that timing can lead to a lingering image that , in the longer term , overwhelms the accomplishments of a person in the prime of their powers			0
@entity1 can make a gracious exit			1
yes , she has every right to run for president and is brilliantly qualified for the job			1
that does not mean , however , she is the best person at this time in @entity5 's narrative			1
there is also nothing inexorable about anyone 's presidential candidacy , regardless of how vehemently it is argued by @entity16 's backers			2
presumptive candidacies , which appear initially like logical choices that are the consequence of devotion and hard politics , often tend toward failure			0
the @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 nominations , presumed candidates with generationally disconnected politics , have sundered the @entity203 's power for possibly decades			0
running for president because it is expected and seems like an obvious decision are clearly not the right motivations			0
@entity16 's service to her country has already transcended even the starry - eyed youthful dreams she shared with her husband			2
beyond her time in office as @entity5 senator , and as secretary of state , and as counsel to @entity218 during his presidency , the namesake foundation she leads with her husband and daughter is having a profound impact in this country and internationally , facilitating education , health care and nutritional programs			1
that nonprofit needs her guidance and initiative			0
@entity5 , though , is ready for different choices representing a new generation for president			1
do n't run , @entity1			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 .			2

@entity237 : @entity1 is brilliantly qualified to be president
@entity235 : but it is time for @entity5 to move on to a new generation of leaders
he says age is an important factor ; do we want another @entity16 dynasty ?
@entity235 : @entity1 can make a gracious exit ; @entity5 should look *forward* rather than back
