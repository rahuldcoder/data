@entity0 -- amid the swirl of claims and counter-claims involving sex , lies , and witness videotapes , one of the most intriguing aspects of @entity5 's so - called " trial of the century " in @entity6 has been the live micro-blogging of proceedings from the courthouse			1
timeline : @entity5 's fall from grace case updates , photos , excerpts of video testimony and partial transcripts were posted on the court 's @entity24 - like @entity23 account during the course of the five - day trial of the former high - flying politician on charges of bribery , embezzlement and abuse of power , attracting more than 590,000 followers			1
state media rushed to herald the micro-blog as a reflection of " historic transparency " and " historic progress for the rule of law " in a country that regularly clamps down on the free flow of information and dissent			1
but while the court 's micro-blog offered unprecedented glimpses into what was widely viewed as a tightly - orchestrated show trial , the flow of information was nonetheless a selective drip - feed that sparked questions about its objectivity			1
five things not to have missed some @entity23 users complained of deleted comments that went against the party line of the trial 's fairness and the certainty of @entity5 's guilt			2
speculation -- in mainstream as well as social media -- about what lay beyond the micro-blog and what was excluded from the transcripts underscored the lack of openness the party claimed to offer			0
people with detailed knowledge of the court proceedings told @entity1 that the micro-blog left out details that may have placed @entity5 in a good light and @entity5 's claims of threats made against him and his family during party investigations			1
and while criminal trials in @entity6 are theoretically open to the public , in practice , the gallery is as open as the state wants it to be			2
@entity5 's trial lacked independent observers -- @entity5 's family , government officials , and a handful of pre-approved journalists were allowed into the courtroom -- while foreign media were relegated to a hotel across the street			2
" for that class of trial , the @entity5 trial was a showcase for how to be more transparent about what goes on inside the courthouse , " said @entity98 , a @entity0 - based researcher for @entity99 , comparing it to the information vacuum during the brief , closed trials of @entity5 's wife and his former right - hand man @entity104 last year			1
" but that 's not real transparency ; it 's selective transparency , " @entity98 added			1
" the party remains in charge of what gets said to the public			0
" @entity118 , another @entity6 human rights researcher based in @entity0 , agreed there was a relatively high amount of information released compared to the vast majority of @entity6 criminal trials , but he questioned the motives behind it			1
" one motivation is to control the narrative			0
part of what spawns rumors online is the lack of transparency , " he said			0
" when you try to take control of the release of information , it draws people into the information and does n't give as much opportunity for straying from that narrative			0
" concurrently , the trial comes against a heightened crackdown on activism under president @entity145 -- with regular arrests of micro-blog users for " rumor mongering " and activists for " assembling a crowd to disrupt order in a public place			2
" over the past several months , state media has reported the arrests of numerous journalists and ordinary citizens across @entity6 for " fabricating online rumors " on their @entity23 accounts			2
on friday , prominent human rights advocate @entity159 was formally arrested for disturbing public order after he was detained last month			0
the same day , @entity161 , a major liberal activist with more than 12 million followers on @entity23 , was detained by @entity164 police on prostitution charges , prompting online speculation that @entity161 was the victim of a set - up			2

@entity98 said the arrests reflect how the @entity145 administration is " very conservative on political matters			0
their rationale is that @entity6 is going through a turbulent period and they need to make some structural adjustments to the economy , civil services , all the acute problems that the system is facing			0
therefore , they can not to afford to have anything destabilize the country			0
" for all the party 's efforts to create an impression of fairness and transparency in the @entity5 trial , analysts interpreted them as one - off gestures tailored for a high - profile case			1
" this was a sensitive case because it revealed so much of the inner workings of the party and the abuses of power and the elite , so it needed a trial that was a match for that , " @entity98 said , calling the proceedings a " good - quality show trial			1
" " but in no way does it indicate a systemic shift in @entity6 toward greater standards in the administration of justice , " he added			0
" it 's far too early to see this as a transformative event that will trickle down into criminal proceedings , " he said			0
at the same time , human rights analysts believe the theatrics will have the unintended effect of raising public expectations of a fair trial in @entity6			1
" at the end of the day , @entity6 criminal trials are primarily about reasserting social and political order over society , not providing a process that pays considered attention to the rights of defendants , " @entity118 said			0
" the @entity6 public is desirous of a criminal process that is more rights - based			1
so seeing this in practice in such a spectacular form , while it might be a one - off , does set a precedent in people 's memories of what a criminal trial can look like			0
" in @entity6 , the role of a judge is not to determine guilt , but rather to decide on a sentence based on information provided by the prosecution			2
the role of the defense is extremely limited , and criminal cases tend to be open - and - shut , with a conviction rate of 99.9 %			0
while @entity5 's long and fiery rebuttal of the charges against him is unlikely to alter what is an all - but - certain guilty verdict , the fact that he defended himself at all is highly unusual in the @entity6 criminal system			1
it is precisely this tension between a party bent on preserving its power and the public 's push for greater rights that will fuel the development of the rule of law in the @entity6 , according to analysts			1
" twenty years ago , [ the party ] did n't need to go through all this , " @entity98 said			0
" but now , if you want to give the citizenry the impression that someone got a fair trial , the bar is much higher			2
" trial by social media			0
