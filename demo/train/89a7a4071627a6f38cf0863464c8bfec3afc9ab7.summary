-- old habits die hard			2
when asked what would represent an acceptable finish at his first major for nearly a year @entity2 replied : " first			1
it 's always the case			2
" such are the standards of a player who sits on 14 career majors , just four shy of the greatest of all time @entity12			1
@entity2 might be ring rusty after his four - month injury layoff but the swales and hollows of royal @entity18 will be familiar to him when the @entity21 starts on thursday			1
the world @entity22 bossed the field the last time the @entity21 was held at @entity25 , romping to a five shot victory in 2006			1
but after going six years without victory in a major championship , the 38 year old acknowledges he contends in a different playing field these days			1
" it gets harder every year because the field gets deeper , " he told reporters			1
" guys coming out here are bigger , stronger , faster and more athletic			0
" when i first started i think i averaged around 296 yards ( in driving distance )			0

the game has changed a lot			0
" woods returned to competitive action on the @entity47 in june after a spell on the sidelines having had surgery on a back injury			1
he failed to make the cut at @entity54 but has undoubted pedigree when it comes to the @entity21			2
aside from a missed cut at @entity58 in 2009 , @entity2 has n't finished outside the top 23 in the last eight incarnations of golf 's oldest major , adding two more wins to his first in 2000			1
he famously strolled to victory at @entity25 in 2006 using his driver just once in four rounds as the course baked in the face of a heatwave			2
" it feels great to come back to @entity25 , " @entity2 said after completing a full practice round			1
" i 'm at three opens and hopefully , i can get more than that			0
" there have been a couple of changes and overall the golf course is a little softer than ' 06			0
" i have played three practice rounds now and had three different winds which has been helpful to see the course in different conditions			0
" it was hot , the ball was flying and it was very dusty in 2006			2
now we are making ball marks on the green			0
" on saturday it was running and fast but on sunday with the rain balls were checking and it played longer			0
today the greens were faster and very close to game speed			0
