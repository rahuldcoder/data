tuesday for making a " quenelle " gesture last month			1
the 34 - year - old striker made the sign , that many believe is a @entity11 salute in reverse , after scoring for his @entity14 team @entity13 against @entity15 on december 28			0
@entity1 faces a minimum five - match ban if found guilty by the @entity4 and has until 1800 gmt on thursday to respond to the charge			1
" @entity1 has received a 34 - page document explaining the allegations against him			1
the player is now considering his options , " @entity13 said			0
the @entity4 , which appointed an expert to help determine the outcome of its investigation , can choose to increase the ban if it sees fit			1
the @entity4 said in a statement : " it is alleged that , in the 40th minute of the fixture , @entity1 made a gesture which was abusive and / or indecent and / or insulting and / or improper , contrary to @entity30 ( 1 )			1
" it is further alleged that this is an aggravated breach , as defined in @entity30 ( 2 ) , in that it included a reference to ethnic origin and / or race and / or religion or belief			0
" the news follows monday 's announcement that @entity13 's main sponsor , unhappy with the @entity1 incident , will end its deal with the club at the end of this season			0
however , new @entity13 manager @entity45 showed his support for @entity1 by selecting him for his first game in charge against @entity49 -- and the club said tuesday he would remain available for selection until the @entity4 makes its ruling			1
" following this , the club will conclude its own internal enquiry , " @entity13 said			0
after monday 's 1 - 1 draw at the @entity57 -- a result which left @entity13 13th in the @entity14 table -- @entity1 took to his official @entity61 account to thank the club for its backing			1
@entity1 has insisted that the gesture , which involves pointing the right arm straight down and touching that arm with the left hand , was a dedication to his friend @entity69 , a controversial @entity2 comedian with whom the move is widely associated			1
" ( the ) meaning ( of ) quenelle : anti-system			0
i do not know what the word religion has to do with this story ! of course , i am neither racist nor anti-semitic , " the footballer , who converted to @entity78 in 2004 , tweeted last month after the incident			0
after making the gesture against @entity15 , @entity1 agreed to his club 's request that he would not repeat it			1
the @entity4 introduced new disciplinary measures in may 2013 stating that players involved in discrimination cases , including racism , religion , sexuality and disability , will be suspended for a minimum of five matches			1
a second offense , meanwhile , will lead to an automatic minimum ban of 10 matches			0
while @entity1 is the first player to be held to account under the new guidelines , @entity96 international @entity95 was banned for 10 matches by @entity98 in december for his " pro-nazi " chants as he celebrated his country 's qualification for the @entity103			2
@entity98 also introduced its new disciplinary measures in may 2013			0
linked to rising anti-semitism in @entity2 , the " quenelle " has sat uncomfortably with @entity106 , a property website co-owned by @entity109 businessman @entity108			2
@entity106 said it will not renew its two - year deal with @entity13 , turning down the possibility of a one - year extension			0
" @entity106 has been reviewing its position over the past few weeks in light of the actions of striker , @entity1 , during the match against @entity15 over the @entity123 period , and has decided to focus its attention on other marketing activities after this season , " the company said in a statement			2
when @entity13 announced the partnership with @entity106 in may 2012 , an official described it as " the most comprehensive deal in the club 's history			0
" the club reacted to @entity106 's statement by saying it had been aware that the sponsorship deal could end at the end of the current season and so " has been planning accordingly			0
" @entity1 is not the only sports star to be embroiled in controversy over the " quenelle			2
" several other @entity2 athletes -- basketballer @entity141 as well as footballers @entity142 and @entity144 -- all having apologized for any offense caused when they were pictured making the gesture			2
it was popularized by @entity69 , who ran in the @entity149 elections as an anti-zionist and who has been fined several times in @entity2 for anti-semitic commentary , a charge over which the 47 - year - old faces an investigation by the @entity159 prosecutor 's office			1
the @entity2 government recently banned one of @entity69 's live performances , successfully doing so in @entity163 earlier this month despite some intense legal wrangling			2
it is not the first time former @entity2 international @entity1 has landed himself in hot water over the years			1
during his time at @entity170 club @entity169 in 2000 , @entity1 fell out with coach @entity171 and was handed a 45 - day suspension for refusing to train			0
at @entity173 in 2012 he was banned from using the first - team car park , forced to use separate changing rooms and made to train with the club 's youth team before moving to @entity179 club @entity178			0
his international career has also been littered with bust - ups , and was told to leave the @entity2 squad during the @entity183 after falling out with coach @entity184 -- it resulted in an 18 - match ban from his own federation , but he laughed it off and announced he would no longer be available for his country .			1

@entity1 is charged by the @entity4 for the gesture he made last month
the former @entity2 international faces a minimum five - match ban
he has until 18:00 gmt on *january* 23 to respond to the charge
the " quenelle " is seen by many as having anti-semitic meaning
