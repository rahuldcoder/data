-- veteran golfer @entity1 took advantage of a remarkable collapse by long - time leader @entity4 to win the @entity5 for the second time at @entity7 and @entity8 sunday			1
the 42 - year - old @entity9 posted a two - under 68 in testing conditions on the links course in @entity12 to go into the clubhouse on seven - under 273 , but @entity14 's @entity4 still looked set to claim his first major title			1
however , a disastrous run of four straight bogeys from the 15th saw the 32 - year - old finish one shot adrift of former world @entity21 , who won his fourth major title and his first since claiming the @entity5 in a playoff in 2002			1
son 's autism gives veteran star @entity1 added spur @entity4 , who had led by four shots going into the final round , pulled his tee shot on the 18th into a bunker , but a fine third left him with an eight - foot putt to force a playoff			1
it went agonizingly wide of the hole to leave him with a final - round 75 and his hopes of glory cruelly dashed			2
by contrast , @entity1 finished with a birdie on his final hole and had been on the practice putting green preparing for a possible playoff			1
he had immediate words of sympathy for the beaten @entity48			0
" first of all i feel for @entity4			1
he is a great friend of mine , " he said			0
" we both wanted to win very badly but it 's the nature of the beast			0
" a stunned @entity4 , who had started the day four shots ahead of @entity56 @entity55 and @entity57 of @entity58 , admitted he had blown it			2
" i 'm pretty disappointed			0
i had it in my hands and managed to hit a poor shot on each of the closing four holes , " he said			2
" but i played so beautifully for most of the week i certainly should not let this get me down			0
" the expected challenge from @entity67 petered out after he made a triple bogey on the par - four sixth			1
he eventually carded a three - over 73 to end three under alongside playing partner @entity55 in a tie for third			0
@entity57 , the 2010 @entity70 champion , also disappointed and fell away with a 75 to tie for fifth at two under with @entity72 's world number one @entity73 , who raced up the leaderboard with a 69			0
@entity1 is the 16th different winner of a golf major in a row , but it looked an unlikely scenario when he was six behind @entity4 after dropping two shots to the turn			1
but he picked up birdies at the 10th , 12th and 14th before his last - hole flourish to put the pressure on the @entity14 , which eventually paid dividends			0
@entity1 has slipped down the world rankings in recent years and did not qualify to play in this year 's @entity87 at @entity88			2
he had gone without a win in 36 major starts since his 2002 @entity5 triumph at @entity92 , but had never lost faith			1
" it was my time for some reason , " @entity1 said			2
" a lot of people never thought i would win another one			0
i started believing this year			0
" he is the same age as last year 's surprise @entity101 @entity5 winner @entity100 , who missed the cut in his title defense .			1

@entity1 wins @entity5 at @entity7 and @entity105
@entity4 bogeys last four holes to hand one - shot win to @entity1
