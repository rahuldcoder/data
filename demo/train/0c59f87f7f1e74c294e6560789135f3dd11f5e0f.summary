@entity0 , @entity1 -- an enraged crowd dragged the body of an @entity7 soldier through the streets of @entity1 's capital thursday after gun battles with @entity12 insurgents killed 19 people , witnesses reported			1
in a brutal echo of a 1993 battle involving @entity1 militias in which the bodies of @entity19 troops were dragged through the streets , crowds thursday shouted " @entity22 is great " as they pulled the bruised , bullet - riddled corpse through a dusty @entity0 neighborhood			1
the body was bound hand and foot with wire and wrapped in a sheet of plastic when insurgents pulled it out of a car and left it with the crowd in the northern @entity0 neighborhood of @entity35 , witnesses reported			1
nine @entity7 are reportedly part of the 19 dead			0
another battle broke out on the city 's south side thursday morning between @entity7 troops and insurgents armed with heavy machine guns and rocket - propelled grenades			0
the fighting drove hundreds more people from their homes , on top of the tens of thousands aid agencies say have fled in recent weeks			0

@entity7 troops arrived in @entity1 in december 2006 to help a weak @entity1 government drive the @entity64 out of @entity0 and restore a @entity66 - backed transitional government after a decade and a half of near - anarchy			1
the @entity12 responded by launching an insurgency against @entity1 government and @entity7 troops that has lasted nearly a year			2
the @entity19 accused the @entity64 of harboring suspected @entity73 figures , including three men wanted in the 1998 bombings of @entity19 embassies in @entity77 and @entity78 , and raised no objections to @entity7 presence in @entity1			2
@entity81 has long been concerned that @entity1 could turn into a safe haven for terrorists , but @entity64 leaders denied harboring @entity73 suspects			1
