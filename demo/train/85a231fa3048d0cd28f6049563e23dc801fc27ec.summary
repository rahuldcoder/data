-- the " @entity3 " surrounding the @entity5 ' surprise phenom at point guard may be motivated by something bigger than sports			0
yes , @entity7 is a terrific athlete , whose almost accidental discovery by the @entity5 and little - engine - that - could perseverance make for great radio commentary and pop cultural mythology			1
but there 's something deeper at play here : @entity7 is iconic of a new kind of hero for the 21st century			1
and he is not alone			0
take @entity7 's story by itself : a @entity19 graduate and only occasional @entity21 basketball star , @entity7 struggles to get recognized in the @entity22			1
he is picked up by the @entity23 only to be released			0
then , plagued by player injuries and in need of an extra backup point guard , the @entity5 pick up @entity7 as a temp backup , only to dump him back in the d - league when they think they do n't need him			1
after a string of losses , they bring him back on board more for the hell of it than anything else , and @entity7 lights a fire under the team , leading it to a run of dramatic victories			1
still , @entity7 is not a superstar in the modern @entity22 slam - dunk sense			1
he can drive to the basket and make clutch plays , but the key to @entity7 's success is his ability to make the rest of his team work -- well , like a team			1
the economics major is a cool intellectual , who looks at his colleagues as part of a system			2
his talent is being able to keep them and the ball moving , and to find the open man -- whoever it might be , even himself			1
this style of play evokes earlier eras of the sport , where teamwork mattered more than individual performance			2
yet it also evokes the spirit of our current era -- one in which networks and connections are coming to matter more than individual skill or personal gain			0
another view : @entity7 's race is a factor consider another @entity19 alum in the headlines these days , @entity79 founder @entity78			1
he came up with his social networking platform in his dorm room , with little more ambition than to create a new way for his college friends to connect to one another			0
and with a combination of perseverance and bit of luck , he ended up in the right place at the right time			0
unlike the charismatic ceos of the industrial age , @entity78 is a rather unassuming , quick - to - gaffe computer programmer whose entire premise -- his entire business -- is based on his ability to keep other people networking			1
at his best , he is a mere facilitator			0
likewise , @entity103 alum @entity102 came out of nowhere			1
a state senator gets picked to keynote a @entity106 convention , and then somehow flips his huge success at that into a winning presidential campaign			0
his rise to viability , remember , depended on the strength of his internet fundraising , and his ability to organize new networks of people around his candidacy through tools like @entity118 and @entity79			0
and again , it 's a cool , plainspoken facilitator at the helm : so cool and deliberative that he infuriates even some of his allies , but a strategist whose deeper instincts about playing the political game are only now coming to light			2
these are not the kind of people we traditionally think of as heroes in sports , technology , and politics			0
compare @entity7 , @entity78 , and @entity102 to , say , @entity136 , @entity137 , and @entity138			1
@entity139 , @entity137 , and @entity138 were stars in their own right			0
their campaigns and their victories were about themselves			0
it was @entity136 who made the dunks , @entity137 who showed us the @entity149 , and @entity138 who made his presidency about himself			0
@entity7 , @entity78 , and @entity102 , on the other hand , are rather underwhelming as tribal leaders			1
they are leaders of the net generation , who owe their power to the networks they can catalyze			0
that 's why the extent to which these three succeed will be based on their ability to keep the story from being about themselves			0
@entity7 's biggest problem right now is his superstardom , and the fact that fan focus and adulation could make it harder for him to keep his senior , star teammates from getting jealous and uncooperative			1
or worse , they could convince @entity7 that he really is all that people wish for him to be			2
likewise , @entity78 's greatest liability is the possibility that the people actually energizing @entity79 -- those of us who use it to connect -- begin to suspect that his company and shareholders matter more than us			2
once it feels like we 're creating more value for him than he is for us , we 're out			0
and finally , @entity102 's success -- and chances for a second term -- may depend on his ability both to keep the ball moving , and keep his adversaries from casting that dependence on teamwork as some form of @entity193 socialism			1
remember , @entity102 did not tell us that he was the one we were waiting for , but rather that we are the ones we have been waiting for			2
this is 21st century leadership , writ large			1
whether we , the president , the @entity197 or even our sports industry are up the challenge is the real question posed by the rise of a kid named @entity7			2
join the conversation on @entity79			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			2

@entity208 says @entity7 is iconic of a new kind of hero for the 21st century
@entity7 , @entity78 and @entity102 are cool , strategic facilitators , he says
he says they must keep the ball moving and keep the story from being about themselves
@entity208 : @entity102 must avoid having teamwork approach cast by others as socialism
