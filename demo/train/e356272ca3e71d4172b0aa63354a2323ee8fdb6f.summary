-- @entity2 and @entity3 have agreed to withdraw their troops from the area surrounding a disputed border temple , the official @entity2 news agency @entity1 reported			1
the two countries reached a deal to implement an order by the @entity10 to put in place a " provisional demilitarized zone " around the @entity13 , @entity1 cited @entity3 defense minister @entity14 as saying at a news conference on wednesday			1
@entity2 and @entity3 troops had clashed in the area around the temple earlier this year , displacing thousands of people on both sides and causing at least 20 deaths			1
a joint working group will be set up to discuss the rules governing the demilitarized zone , @entity14 said after meeting with the @entity2 defense minister , general @entity25 , in the @entity3 capital , @entity27			0
the troop withdrawals , to be carried out as soon as possible , will be supervised by observers from @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity30 , the chair of the @entity32 , @entity14 said			0
@entity3 had asked the @entity10 , the @entity34 's highest court , to intervene and order @entity2 troops out of the area			1
the court , instead , ruled in july that both sides must withdraw their troops to avoid more casualties			0
the 11th century temple sits atop a cliff on @entity3 soil but has its most accessible entrance on the @entity2 side			2
the two countries differ on whether some territory around the temple forms part of @entity2 or @entity3			1
the @entity10 awarded the temple to @entity3 in 1962			2
@entity2 claims , however , that the 1.8 square mile ( 4.6 sq. km ) area around it was never fully demarcated			0
@entity2 says the dispute arose from the fact that the @entity3 government used a map drawn during the @entity54 occupation of @entity3 -- a map that places the temple and surrounding area in @entity3 territory			2
in 2008 , the @entity34 approved @entity3 's application to have the temple listed as a @entity60 -- a place the @entity34 says has outstanding universal value			0
