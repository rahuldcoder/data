-- @entity1 salvaged his " frustrating year " with a dramatic victory in the @entity3 sunday to shatter @entity5 's hopes of completing his domestic triple crown			1
@entity7 was bidding to match @entity9 's 2005 feat of winning the @entity11 pga , @entity11 masters and @entity3 crowns in the same season , but instead @entity1 took advantage of some late lapses to capture his only title of 2013			1
the @entity17 rolled home a 10 - foot birdie putt on the final hole to complete a final round of six - under 66 for 18 - under 270			0
it left him a shot clear of @entity5 , who had led since carding a course record 62 at @entity27 on the first day			1
@entity1 , who has been blighted by problems both on and of the course , could scarcely believe his good fortune , but it was reward for dogged play having started the final round four shots behind @entity5			1
" i 'm really pleased but since september i 've just felt in a better place mentally with some of the things off the course , " he told gathered reporters			0
@entity1 , who has changed his management team , which now includes his father @entity40 , showed promise of better things to come with his sixth place finish in the @entity45 event in @entity46 and tied fifth in the @entity47 in @entity48			2
having started 2013 in top spot , he has slipped to sixth in the rankings with a previous best finish of second in the @entity53 and disappointing displays in the four majors			0
" it 's been a frustrating year , " he admitted			0
" i 've worked hard to win golf tournaments and it 's really nice to do it today			0
" @entity60 champion @entity5 looked a heavy favorite to finish the season on a historic high , but was let down by his putter			2
" it was always going to be a tough day and @entity1 made his move and i just could n't knock in the putts you expect to make , " he said			2
@entity5 might have moved two clear of @entity1 but he three putted the 16th and lipped out a birdie effort on the 17th			1
still leading by a shot playing the last , @entity5 's approach went past the flag and a poor chip left him a 40 footer for par , which he missed , leaving the door open for two - time major winner @entity1			1
@entity11 's @entity78 shot a final day 66 to claim third spot , seven shots adrift			1
but he secured one of three 2014 @entity83 qualifying spots on offer this week , with the others claimed by compatriots @entity87 and @entity88			0
meanwhile on the @entity90 , former masters champion @entity89 won the @entity91 for the second straight year			0
