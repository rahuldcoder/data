@entity0 -- pope @entity2 met friday with a group of people who had been sexually abused by clergy in his native @entity6 , where disenchantment with the @entity8 has grown in the wake of the scandal			1
the meeting , which occurred at a seminary in @entity13 , came on the second day of the pontiff 's four - day visit to his homeland			2
besides talking with victims of sexual abuse committed by priests and church personnel , he also met with people " who care for those injured by these crimes , " according to a statement from the @entity26 press office			1
" moved and deeply shaken by the sufferings of the victims , the @entity27 expressed his deep compassion and regret over all that was done to them and their families , " the statement added			1
" he assured the people present that those in positions of responsibility in the church are seriously concerned to deal with all crimes of abuse and are committed to effective measures for the protection of children			0
" the pope has had similar meetings elsewhere , in the face of outcries from many nations in @entity49 , @entity50 and beyond criticizing the church for its handling of sexual abuse cases			2
friday 's visit was unique in that it took place in the homeland of @entity2 , where he 'd also served as a cardinal			2
he himself got caught up in the scandal in at least one case , when he -- as cardinal @entity2 -- approved the transfer of a man within @entity6 in the wake of accusations that the man had abused children			1
but the archdiocese has said the then - cardinal was never personally aware of the details of the man 's case			0

and candidates for the priesthood have plummeted 62 % since 1990 , according to the @entity96			0

" " there can be a fruitful collaboration between @entity123 and @entity111 , " @entity2 said in the speech , a transcript of which was provided by the @entity26			1
