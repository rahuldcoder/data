" central bankers in the most vulnerable emerging market economies are being forced into action			1
the @entity23 raised the country 's key interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 8 percent this week			0
@entity28 's central bank followed suit wednesday			1
their actions come as the @entity32 's policy making group will decide this week whether to trim another $ 10 billion in bond purchases as it continues to unwind stimulus support			0
the initial response was positive : investors pushed up equity markets and emerging market currencies wednesday , starting in southeast @entity40			1
the interest rate hikes by the bigger emerging markets are seen as an effort to plug severe leaks in a monetary dike which threatened to drain reserves that were being used to defend their currencies			1
economist @entity52 , speaking at the @entity0 emerging market roundtable at the @entity50 in @entity51 last week , described what we are witnessing as a perfect mini-storm which is being driven by the @entity32 , rising inflation , a slowdown in @entity59 's manufacturing sector and large current account deficits in a handful of developing countries			1
