-- in the new issue of @entity0 , contributing editor @entity2 smokes weed with @entity4 and chats with the late - night host about his promotion to the coveted 11:30 p.m. time slot , his undying hatred of @entity9 and why he sees @entity10 as a " worthy competitor			1
" here 's an excerpt from the latest cover story , " here 's @entity10 " : photos : a history of comedy stars on the cover of @entity0 in 24 hours , @entity4 will stand up in his office at the @entity21 theatre in @entity22 , looking less like a talk - show host and more , to use his words , like " a hobo			1
" he 'll be wearing baggy mesh @entity27 shorts , a rumpled old @entity30 t - shirt and no shoes ; his hair will stick out in three directions			2
as he leaves his desk , where he 's been refining jokes since the morning , his transformation into late - night star will begin			2
after a quick haircut , he 'll carry his macbook to the makeup room , where he 'll put the finishing touches on his monologue while a woman named @entity44 puts the finishing touches on his face : powdering his skin , shaping his eyebrows , blackening his hair where it 's a bit too gray or a bit too thin for hd			2
the 25 funniest people on @entity53 in his private bathroom , he 'll change into a crisp white shirt , a colorful @entity57 tie and slim blue @entity59 pants			0
his wardrobe guy will bring the matching jacket , steamed and lint - rolled and bearing a sticker on its lining that says @entity64 above a bar code marking it as network property			0
" i 've got the same bar code tattooed on me , " @entity4 will joke			1
" it used to say @entity69 , but they changed it when the ratings got good			0
" as he makes his way downstairs -- where a 200 - strong crowd is waiting for that night 's episode of @entity76 to start -- a group of writers , producers and crew will fist - bump @entity4 and chant , as they do before every episode , " best show ever ! best show ever ! " his band will launch into an ecstatic fanfare and @entity4 will stroll out , hit his electrical - taped mark , and fix his eyes on the teleprompter as the audience roars its welcome : showtime			1
@entity0 cover story : @entity95 's big adventure but that 's not for 24 hours			2
right now it 's sunday night , @entity4 is at his beach house , and he wants to get high			1
" if we smoke weed right now , " he asks , " is that on the record ? " @entity4 is sitting at a weathered wooden table in his dining room			1
blinky and unshaven , hair tousled , he looks like he just woke up from a phenomenal nap			0
@entity4 's fiancee , @entity76 co-head writer @entity107 , is in the kitchen , drinking fruit punch and tapping on her phone			1
" i do n't know if i want this in the story , " @entity4 , 45 , says , padding off to retrieve his stash			1
" my kids are gon na read this			0
. " he returns with a vacuum - sealed baggie bulging with buds the size of baby @entity121 sprouts			0
