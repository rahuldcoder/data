-- @entity2 anchorman @entity1 remembers that when the pain began on august 1 , it came out of the blue			1
" i woke up that thursday morning prepared to go to the gym and then go to work and have a regular day , " he said			2
" but i had this incredible , sudden pain in my stomach that was something that i have never felt before in my life			1
it felt like a horse had kicked me			1
" he admits that was n't enough to move him to seek help , though he says the pain was worse than other injuries and illnesses			1
he has had broken bones , surgeries , popped tendons , fallen off a truck , and driven himself to the hospital with severe appendicitis			2
" i 've actually been run over by a truck -- none of that compared to what i felt in my stomach at that time			1
" i 'm going through pain unlike any pain i have ever felt in my life and it literally knocked me to the floor and you know , being a stupid guy , a regular guy , i did what most guys do			1
i said : you know let me just take some @entity38 , let me pop a couple of @entity41 pills , that 'll take care of it , it 's just gas			2
" an hour later , his wife , @entity44 , who had recently graduated from nursing school , found him writhing in pain on the floor			1
she immediately got him to a local hospital			2
@entity1 credits her for saving his life			1
he says unequivocally , if she had n't come upstairs when she did , he would n't still be here			2
he thought he would just spend the night in he hospital and be back to normal the next day			2
but about 4 o'clock that morning things got serious			2
" all of a sudden , the door opened , these guys came rushing in the room saying we 've got ta to go to intensive care immediately ... and i was sort of in a fog , not on any drugs at the time except for pain meds			1
i found out later it was because they said my kidneys were shutting down and my lungs were beginning to fill up with fluid			2
" they called my wife and said you need to get here immediately because we need to intubate him -- to put me on a ventilator and they needed her to sign off on it			1
" when @entity44 arrived , he remembers she asked him where his phone charger was			2
at that moment , he says , his eyes rolled back up in his head and he passed out			2
" i was pretty much out from that moment for the next nine days			0
" so , within 36 hours of that initial " kick " in the stomach , @entity1 was being life - flighted to @entity81 in @entity82			1
" for you to be life - flighted you 've got to be in pretty bad shape , " he says			0
@entity1 got a diagnosis of necrotizing pancreatitis			1
" my pancreas basically decided to start dying and taking my kidneys , my lungs and other internal organs along with it			0
" he says his doctors described his gut as looking like " a bomb had gone off inside me			1
" he adds , " you do n't get symptoms until it 's already happening and if you do n't get that process stopped quickly enough it can be fatal , and that 's what was so dangerous about the situation i was in			0
" in order to allow his pancreas to heal , @entity1 says he was n't allowed to have anything in his mouth for 17 days , relying on feeding tubes for nourishment and a tube down his windpipe to breathe			1
the main causes of pancreatitis are gallbladder disease and alcohol consumption			1
@entity1 has a family history of gallbladder disease			1
while the specific cause for him is unknown , @entity1 knows this type of infection can be fatal and he says he came close to dying a couple of times			1
" my heart stopped and they actually had to revive me ... at one point they were trying to replace the tube into my windpipe			0
they were able to get me revived and the same thing happened the very next day			0
i had the tubes going down into my windpipe and i just knew that i could n't breathe			0
that was the absolute worst part of the whole thing			0
the pain in my stomach , fine -- that felt like someone had just taken a knife and cut my entire insides out			1
that was nothing compared to not being able to breathe			0
that sensation of not being able to breathe , it was just like trying to go run a marathon breathing thru a cocktail straw			0
" he was so uncomfortable , he tried to pull one of the tubes out			0
" i punched people , i kicked people			0
at one point it took 10 people to keep me on the table			0
" he was restrained , his hands and feet tied down for his own protection			0
he says hospital staff nicknamed him the beast			0
eventually that fight began to take a toll			0
" august 9 , i just got exhausted and i said i give up , i ca n't fight this anymore , what 's the sense of fighting , and just decided ok , fine , this is @entity162 's way of telling me , ' ok buddy this is it ' and so that night i begged them to let me die			1
" but when he closed his eyes , @entity1 says he saw his wife 's face			1
" that 's when i said i ca n't quit			0
if i quit i 'm gon na go to hell and i 'm not gon na go to hell for quitting			0
if i go to hell it 's gon na be for something else , it wo n't be for quitting			0
" @entity1 recovered and some are calling it miraculous			1
" if there is such a thing as a miracle , the night of august 9 is when it happened			2
i begged to die and by august 10 i had a miracle , " he said			2
he has an even bigger appreciation for his wife and two children and the friends and family who stood by him during this ordeal			0
he also has some advice for other men who may be ignoring what their body is telling them			0
" do n't wait until you have as close a brush with leaving this @entity195 as i did before you decide that you 're worth going to see a doctor			0
... do n't say ' eh , i do n't need to go see a doctor ' -- yeah you do ! " @entity1 continues to recuperate and is back at work			1
he returned to the anchor desk on september 9 .			0
