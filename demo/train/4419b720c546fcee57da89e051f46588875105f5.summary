-- i 've never understood how someone can eat just one @entity3			1
in my mind , those scrumptious cookies are supposed to be eaten in groups of six or eight or more , and it would be a culinary sin not to wash them down with a large glass of milk			1
my name is @entity13 , and i am a food addict			1
i used to fill up on stuff , not really knowing what i was eating but just going through the motions until i got my " fix			1
" most of the time i was left with guilt , gas and a growing stomach to accompany my gluttony			1
people would tell me simply " do n't eat that " or " just do n't buy it " or " leave it alone			2
" once in a while , it would work			2
but most of the time , there was an almost uncontrollable urge to indulge -- i just had to have whatever it was that i thought my taste buds were craving			2
my name is @entity13 , and i am a food addict			1
is it possible for a person to be addicted to something that they need to sustain life ? modern science tells us that the nicotine in cigarettes can be as addictive as heroin			2
we know that alcoholics are always susceptible to their drink of choice			2
but what about food ? there 's compelling research to suggest certain foods affect the brain 's pleasure centers the same way addictive substances do , but experts disagree on whether the cravings rise to the level of addiction			1
diabetes took my teeth but not my life after my gastric bypass surgery , i had to eat only soft foods for two weeks			1
during that time , a national chain was advertising its chicken - fried steak sandwich			2
that was the last thing i needed after what i had just put my body through			2
but the urge was so strong that i ended up going to the restaurant , ordering the sandwich , and bite by bite , chewing each morsel , then spitting it out back into the bag			0
how stupid was that ? i could have endangered myself if i had swallowed , but i felt i had to satisfy the craving			0
my name is @entity13 , and i am a food addict			1
i know now that my addiction to food was a symptom of a much deeper problem			1
i ca n't tell you when it started , but food had become my confidant			1
it would n't openly condemn me ; it would n't make fun of me			0
it made me feel good ( while i was eating it ) , and it was always there when i wanted attention			0
it was my little secret -- my reward for working so hard for everybody else			0
fit nation : too young not to run i did n't realize this about myself until i had gone through my surgery and was forced to find a new way to deal with difficult circumstances			1
i no longer could eat to feel better ; i needed to find a healthier way to deal with life			0
i chose to make a healthy lifestyle my goal , and notable successes i found along the way became the warm fuzzies i needed to validate that i was a worthy individual			0
i believe that my food addiction is real			1
i have been " sober " now for six years and two months , and i feel great			0
here 's the good news : as long as you have breath , you have the ability to change			0
it is not a battle of the tongue , but a battle of the mind			0
yes , i used weight loss surgery to start the process , but it is only a tool , not a cure			1
i had to hit rock bottom before i realized that i have the ability to decide each day how my life is going to go			0
once i made the decision to live the second half of my life better than the first , a new journey began			0
it has been rough at times			0
i still get a craving now and then , but the difference is in how i respond			0
i have let things into my life that have so much more value than the satisfaction of a chicken - fried steak sandwich			0
nothing tastes as good as the feeling of good health			0
more from @entity13 : that dying patient could have been me			1

experts disagree on whether food cravings rise to the level of addiction
@entity13 says his food addiction left him with guilt , gas and growing stomach
@entity13 had gastric bypass surgery and is now *training* for a *triathlon*
