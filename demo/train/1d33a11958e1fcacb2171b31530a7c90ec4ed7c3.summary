-- as last night 's @entity3 presidential debate over national security issues demonstrated , credibility is crucial to winning a debate			1
think of credibility like money you have in a bank			1
each time you stretch it thin , you have less the next time you might need it			2
it is your own personal bank of believability			2
knowing your arguments and facts is one way to gain credibility			2
@entity22 fattened his credibility bank account at the expense of @entity25 , who supported a no fly zone over @entity27			1
@entity22 argued that a no fly zone over @entity27 would be pointless since the @entity27 government has 5,000 tanks			1
@entity22 jokingly said it would make more sense to impose a " no drive zone			1
" @entity34 made a similar deposit when he stated that sanctions on @entity37 would not work since " the @entity38 are n't going to play ball and the @entity40 are n't going to play ball , " and @entity37 has already decided to go nuclear			1
@entity34 's cited the examples of @entity43 ( which gave up its nuclear ambition , and later the government was overthrown with the help of the @entity47 ) and @entity48 ( which has tested nuclear weapons and whose government is still in power			1
) another way to maintain credibility is to cite proof for your arguments			2
@entity57 has said things in previous debates ( president @entity60 wants @entity61 to collapse ) and in last night 's debate ( suggesting that the @entity63 can not interrogate terrorist suspects any longer because the @entity65 is in charge ) that were not very credible			1
these frequent atm withdrawals hurt @entity57 because a lack of believability spills over			1
her disagreement with @entity25 about whether to give aid to @entity73 should have been an excellent point for her			1
she showcased her knowledge of the subject , saying that we exchange intelligence information and the @entity47 must have our interest represented			2
@entity57 called @entity73 " too nuclear to fail , " and chastised @entity25 for being @entity81 ve when he said he would not give @entity73 one penny until it proved it had @entity47 's best interests in mind			1
this was a terrific answer that warranted applause because it was thoughtful , logical and well reasoned			2
what did she get ? crickets			2
why ? because her believability bank is in the red			0
he can provide such thoughtful answers at one time and later interject completely unsubstantiated statements			0
he was banking responsibly with his argument that the war on drugs was a failure and a reason for much of the violence in @entity104			0
@entity93 reminded us that prescription drugs kill many more people than illegal drugs do and that alcohol is a deadly drug			0
@entity93 's argument was factually accurate , even if unpopular with many conservatives			2
but then @entity93 writes an overdraft with moderate @entity3 by saying things like aid to @entity116 for malaria or aids prevention is " all worthless			0
" @entity93 hit the daily double			0
wrong on facts ? check			0
there are countless examples of disease prevention aid being effective			0
could aid be more effective ? sure			0
but that was not @entity93 's answer			0
he simply asserted that aid is worthless , but he had no proof			0
answering questions with non-answers simply is n't credible			0
for example , @entity132 twice last night reached into a very old bag of tricks to answer questions with the standard " i 'd consult the experts " line			1
actually , he originally answered a question about terrorist profiling with his support of " targeted identification			0
" but when asked a follow - up not 20 seconds later , he retreated by saying he would " ask the professionals			0
" nothing hurts your credibility worse than flip - flopping on the same question and diving into a non-answer			2
@entity132 's bank account is probably under a thousand dollars			1
but that still leaves him 999			0
finally , to save credibility , you should be prepared to defend your position when giving a potentially unpopular answer			1
@entity156 had two answers that the conservative wing of his party might not like , but he defended them well			1
@entity160 said it was possible to cut some of the military because , " if it takes 15 to 20 years to build a weapons system when @entity166 changes technology every nine months , there 's something profoundly wrong with the system			0
" and @entity160 went against the @entity3 current when he stated that some long - term illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay legally , but without citizenship , in the @entity47			0
@entity22 and others said giving amnesty would be a magnet for more people to come illegally to the @entity47			1
@entity160 said we should be humane , and he was ready to take the heat for his stance			0
@entity160 has enough credibility banked because of his stances on other issues that he was able to withstand the criticism on this one			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			1

@entity188 : *key* currency in debates is your stock of credibility
he says @entity22 , @entity34 added to their credibility
credibility of @entity57 , @entity25 , @entity132 running low , he says
