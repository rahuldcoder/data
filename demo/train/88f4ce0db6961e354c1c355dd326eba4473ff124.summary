@entity1 , @entity2 a human face appeared in white paint on the end of his finger			1
it sounds crazy , but the way late folk artist @entity9 told the story , the mysterious face said , " paint sacred art ; paint sacred art. " the vision came to the retired @entity17 preacher in 1976 while he was working on a bicycle in his @entity1 , @entity2 , repair shop			1
one of a lifelong string of visions , it was just the sign he needed to devote the rest of his days to spreading @entity27 's message through art. @entity9 was 59			1
" when most people are winding down , he was winding up , " said @entity28 , executive director of @entity29 , a 4 - acre property teeming with @entity9 's creations , about 90 miles northwest of @entity32			1
and more than a dozen years after his death , interest in @entity36 seems to be winding up again , too			0
he 's one of the headliners in a new exhibit in @entity40 at the @entity41 , which bills him as " @entity42 's most prolific self - tutored and ' on fire ' artist			1
" he 's also the star of the documentary " @entity29 : @entity9 's @entity47 , " released this year by @entity46			1
but perhaps most significant , there 's a revival under way in the garden where he worked frenetically , day and night , to grow towering heaps of bicycle parts and a meditation chapel draped in whimsical bric - a - brac along with hand - painted @entity58 verses , a covered " @entity69 " gallery , the glimmering @entity61 's @entity60 and a mosaic wonderland embedded with plastic toys , fragments of mirror , shards of colored glass , @entity68 and more			1
@entity29 is located about 90 miles northwest of @entity32 in unincorporated @entity1 , @entity2			1
the garden is open tuesday - saturday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and sunday from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. @entity71 is $ 5 for adults , $ 3 for seniors and $ 2 for children			2
the documentary " @entity29 : @entity47 " is showing november 18 at 7:30 p.m. at the @entity75 in @entity32			1
@entity9 was a musician , a showman and an avid artistic collaborator			1
in the 1980s , he designed album covers for @entity79 and the @entity80 , and charmed audiences with his tales , songs and banjo - playing on @entity85 's " @entity84			2
" @entity79 's " @entity87 " music video was filmed in the garden			1
yet his overarching purpose was clear , and he defined it simply : " @entity27 called me here			0
i 'm interested in every human being in this world , " he said during a 1987 event at the garden			2
" i did n't come here to put nothin ' on nobody , push nothin ' on nobody			0
i did n't come here to take nothin ' away from nobody			0
i did n't come here to start some new kind of religion			0
" i come here for one thing , and that is , i have visions of other worlds			0
i have visions that 's inimaginable			2
i have visions that i ca n't even tell people			0
and i try , the best i can , to draw my visions , " he said			0
he did n't sleep much			0
@entity9 produced 46,991 numbered works before he died in 2001 at 84			1
and that figure does n't include most of what 's on view in the garden			1
the jumbled property in northern @entity2 was in desperate need of attention after @entity119 purchased the garden in late 2011 and handed management to the @entity122 in 2012			1
over the past few years , the foundation has literally been digging the art out			0
the new documentary film , directed by @entity126 , chronicles the process from the beginning			2
the swampy ground where the @entity9 family made their home in the early 1960s had started to reclaim some of the structures that sprouted up in the garden over the years			1
with the help of more than $ 700,000 in grant money , the foundation has raised and stabilized many of the garden 's key attractions			1
the restoration has been a delicate balance , though			2
" we went to great lengths to have it slightly decayed - looking			0
we do n't want it to be pristine , " @entity28 said			0
@entity9 and his wife , @entity148 , moved down the road to @entity150 in the early ' 90s after @entity148 got fed up with fans turning up at all hours for an audience with her husband			1
although @entity9 still spent a lot of time at the garden , it did n't get as much attention after the couple moved , @entity28 said , and deteriorated after @entity9 's death in 2001			1
now , there 's a new visitor center with exhibition space and an audiovisual experience that introduces guests to the " man of visions , " plus new plumbing and electricity for that unglorifed but essential museum amenity : restrooms			2
the site is now welcoming about 7,000 visitors a year , @entity28 said			0
it 's not a huge number but definitely a huge spike			0
visitation jumped by more than 400 % between august 2012 and august 2014			0
the restoration is good for the garden , but it 's also good for the unincorporated community of @entity1 and neighboring @entity150			1
" it 's not just to save the place for its own sake but ... to help a community and be a part of that community and to reawaken a community that was really and truly almost dead just a couple years ago , " said @entity28 , who grew up in @entity150			2
new businesses and art galleries have opened			0
there 's more activism around the arts , and local business are embracing cultural tourism , @entity28 said			0
there 's still a lot of work to be done			2
the foundation aims to raise $ 900,000 for the next phase of the garden 's revival			2
one key goal of the next phase 's capital campaign is to rehabilitate the rotting interior of the @entity206 , a church that @entity9 bought with a grant in 1982 and retopped to look like a towering wedding cake			1
despite the work ahead , the transformation is already apparent to repeat visitors			0
@entity212 , 56 , an art teacher from @entity213 , @entity2 , has been to the garden several times since her first visit in 2007			1
she visited again at the end of october with a group of middle school students			0
there 's been a " huge change " since her last visit about two years ago , she said			0
" it 's beautiful , " @entity223 said			0
" i can tell they 're still working , but it just seems like it 's loved , well - loved			0
