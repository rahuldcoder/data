across , government officials said , according to @entity7			0
no damage or injuries were reported			0
@entity7 quoted government spokeswoman @entity10 as saying they 've determined it was a " relatively small " meteorite that " appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to @entity13			1
" @entity14 has n't confirmed a link between the meteorite and the asteroid			1
the newly discovered asteroid , called 2014 @entity18 , was expected to pass safely above the @entity13 on sunday , @entity14 said , at a distance of about 25,000 miles ( 40,000 kilometers ) -- just one - tenth the distance from the center of @entity13 to the moon			1
it was estimated to be 60 feet ( 18 meters ) long			2
local media reported that scientists are trying to find remains of the meteorite , and @entity3 is asking the @entity28 to help investigate the event			1
" all the evidence that we 've confirmed on - site corresponds exactly with a meteorite , " @entity30 with the @entity31 was quoted as saying on the today @entity3 website			1
but @entity14 's @entity37 is skeptical			2
" it has been suggested that a meteorite may have caused this crater ; however , the lack of fireball reports from the surrounding populated area seems to suggest some other cause , " @entity37 wrote in a @entity14 blog post			1
" the skies were partially clear , and an object capable of producing a crater this large would have also generated a very bright fireball ( brighter than the @entity51 ) that should have been seen over a wide area			2
" the today @entity3 site reported the crater was found after a loud blast about 11:05 p.m. on saturday			1
the @entity56 said the hole is in the woods near @entity2 's @entity59 and about 1,000 feet ( 300 meters ) from the @entity60			1
@entity14 's @entity61 estimates there are thousands of asteroids that could threaten @entity13 , but experts say none of the ones being tracked is expected to hit the planet anytime soon			2
sometimes , though , space rocks sneak by the scientists and amateur astronomers who track them			0
on february 15 , 2013 , a nearly 60 - foot - wide meteor plunged into @entity13 's atmosphere and exploded over the @entity74 city of @entity75 with the force of about 30 nuclear bombs			0
the blast injured about 1,500 people			0
the @entity75 meteor was undetected before it was spotted by local residents as it streaked across the sky			0
it exploded on the same day that asteroid 2012 @entity85 , one that was being carefully tracked by @entity14 , safely passed by @entity13			2
@entity14 is trying to speed up the way it tracks potentially hazardous asteroids and to learn how to deflect rocks that threaten @entity13			0
its @entity89 includes a plan to capture an asteroid and tug it into orbit around the moon in the 2020s			0
if it works , astronauts will land on the asteroid , take samples and bring them back to @entity13 .			0
