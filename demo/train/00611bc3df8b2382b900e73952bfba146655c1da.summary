@entity0 , @entity1 -- who do you ask for help if you need to turn a muddy hole in the ground into a futuristic grand prix track ? " he 's my sort of man , " @entity10 supremo @entity9 says of @entity1 president @entity12 's influence in the project to stage the nation 's first grand prix this october in @entity0			1
" he knows what he wants to do and he gets on and does it			0
i 've never had any fear that what he agreed to do would n't happen			0
i think ( @entity1 has ) done a first - class job for @entity10 and a super job for the @entity25 , " @entity9 told @entity2			1
it 's the kind of ringing endorsement that stands out like an oasis in a desert for a politician much derided for many of his policies by a large swathe of the international community			0
but then , the 83 - year - old @entity9 has a reputation for favoring those who he believes can deliver on their promises and thereby aid @entity10 's further expansion			1
the growth of motorsport 's elite division into one of the world 's most valuable sport franchises has been built on such relationships and @entity9 's shrewd 40 - year management of them			2
the @entity0 circuit is the culmination of talks that first started in the 1980s , when a plan to run a race through @entity53 in @entity54 was abandoned -- " they did n't want to replace the cobblestones with paving , " says @entity9 -- and is a major statement of intent from @entity12 's government to secure the city 's @entity61 future			1
talks became serious six years ago , when the @entity25 project gained momentum			0
" he 's been following the plans all of the way through , " @entity9 says of @entity12 's involvement			1
new locations are always a risk for @entity10 's management			2
the promise of lucrative hosting deals and iconic locations often turn to dust before coming to reality , as plans for a race in @entity80 recently demonstrated			0
but the @entity0 pitch filled @entity9 with confidence , so much so that a six - year deal reportedly worth in excess of $ 250 million -- though @entity9 would not confirm that figure -- was signed to secure the event until 2020			1
" i think @entity1 is an important nation full stop			0
@entity10 is a world championship , so it 's difficult to think of leaving @entity1 out of a world event like this , " @entity9 said			1
" we looked at what they were building ... and tailored ourselves around what they had constructed for the events already			0
" but the task of fitting an @entity10 circuit within the confines of an @entity101 proved no easy task			2
" originally we had an idea to build the track through the main @entity110 , " @entity103 , promoter of the @entity104 , told @entity2 from his office in the paddock area of the newly - built pit lane compound			1
so organizers turned to track designer @entity112 -- " nothing is impossible for him , " says @entity103 -- with the @entity116 engineer offering another plan more suitable for the @entity101 facilities			1
" it was a big hole ! " says @entity112 , recalling his initial impressions of when he visited the @entity0 site in 2010			1
" it looked like a desert of mud ... but i had a fantasy in my mind of how it would look later so i was n't too worried			0
" the complexity of the new circuit design -- it needed to be cut through the middle of the @entity101 and weaved in between the stadium and arenas -- provided @entity112 with plenty of challenges			2
" i 've had more meetings about @entity0 than any other track , " the architect says			2
" we were a construction site within a construction site ... ( but ) in many ways it 's like a city track -- you can not move a house in a city , you have to work with the situation			0
" the stadiums , arenas and pipes and cables under the earth had to be factored in			0
" turn four -- a long , sweeping circular corner which the cars will enter at 80 miles per hour and exit at 190 mph -- fills @entity112 with particular pride , and he believes it will be " the hardest in @entity10 , " especially when the surface is slippery or when attempted on degraded tires			1
despite his pride at a job well done , @entity112 admits he 'll feel " very nervous " on the day of the race because the track until then remains a prototype			0
as with the @entity25 constructions , it seems costs were not foremost in organizers ' minds in their ambition to construct a world - class facility			0
" we 've spent about $ 330 million ( so far )			1
but i 'm not worried about the cost only about the quality , " @entity103 says			0
" i can say for sure that the cost of the track will be three to four times cheaper than the circuit in @entity177			0
" the promoter is hoping a race on @entity1 soil will attract many of the country 's @entity10 fans who already travel the world to watch the championship , as well as creating a new domestic supporter base willing to pay $ 200 a ticket to attend			1
" about 60,000 fans are expected to come here and that will mean an extension of the resort season ( in the town ) too , " says @entity103			0
" it 's also suitable to use the track throughout the season -- we 've signed contracts with @entity199 , @entity200 , the @entity201 and hope to attract @entity202 , " adds @entity103 , a fan of motorcycling star @entity193			2
the plans for the @entity204 certainly do n't lack for ambition and chime well with the wider @entity12 - driven plan of trying to rebrand @entity1 through the city			1
it 's maybe the reason @entity9 expects the @entity1 president to attend the inaugural race in october and why he remains so enthusiastic about this month 's @entity211			1
" people love to criticize anything new do n't they ? but we 'll look back at @entity216 and say it did n't come close to what we 've just seen in @entity0 , " @entity9 argues			2
maybe the same will soon be said of the @entity104 .			0
