civil rights activists reenacting a 1965 march from @entity1 to @entity2 , @entity3 , are doing more than just reliving an important part of @entity6 history -- they are bringing a new message to an old fight			1
two days after @entity14 president @entity13 -- along with organizer the rev. @entity10 and the rev. @entity11 -- were joined by thousands of people , both young and old , to mark the 47th anniversary of @entity1 , their journey through @entity3 continues			1
participants say this year -- an election year -- is about more than just remembering , it 's about raising consciousness			2
" right now , we are seeing the @entity21 attacked more consistently across the country than we have seen since it was passed			0
since crossing the @entity24 on sunday , marchers are continuing on to @entity2 to bring attention to what they call a modern - day attack on voting rights			1
" we need people to understand that not only is history not very distant , but we stand on the precipice of repeating it , " @entity13 said			0
the @entity14 leader said strict voter id laws that wo n't allow people to vote without a driver 's license or passport are unnecessary and will make it difficult -- and in some cases impossible -- for 5 million people to vote			2
" we need to make sure that the principle of one person , one vote , is respected , " he said			0
new marchers -- including a @entity45 student from @entity46 who came with other members of a campus organization called @entity49 , and senior citizens from @entity51 -- all made the trip to @entity3 to fight voting restrictions nationwide			1
some older activists came to relive a turbulent time in @entity6 history			2
as a girl , @entity58 , who was born in 1911 , sent a letter to the rev. @entity61 asking him to participate in the march			0
this time , she could n't make the journey on foot , so @entity58 is being driven along the route			0
she is joined by another elderly woman who was 11 and a member of the @entity14 youth council on march 7 , 1965			1
on that day , protesters fighting for the right to vote tried to cross the @entity24 and were beaten back by police officers and attacked by dogs			1
the brutal attack became known as @entity1			2
this month , the @entity74 unanimously passed a resolution to gather and preserve a collection of accounts from current and former members of @entity79 who were involved in civil rights marches in the state			1
@entity13 agrees that is important that people know and remember the legacy of @entity1			2
" we need people to know what happened , " he said			0
" we need students to know that people risked their lives			0
" participants will have walked more than 20 miles by the end of day tuesday			0
once the walking ends , marchers will gather for the evening at @entity94 and sleep on cots , @entity14 spokesman @entity91 said			0
the march , which was primarily organized by the @entity98 with support from the @entity14 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and other groups , is expected to end friday on the steps of the @entity105 in @entity2 with a call to repeal voter id laws and @entity3 's @entity108 , a strict anti-immigration law .			1
