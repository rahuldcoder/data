@entity0 are not a nation of moochers and helpless dependents			2
those who are not paying federal income tax would gladly do so , because it would mean they have a decent - paying job			2
@entity8 presidential candidate @entity7 is right that 47 % of @entity0 do n't pay federal income tax			1
but he is wrong to suggest almost half of @entity0 pay no tax at all and feel entitled to live off government handouts			1
@entity7 said : " there are 47 % of the people who will vote for the president no matter what			1
all right , there are 47 % who are with him , who are dependent upon government , who believe that they are victims , who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them , who believe that they are entitled to health care , to food , to housing , to you - name - it			2
but that 's an entitlement			0
and the government should give it to them			0
and they will vote for this president no matter what			0
... these are people who pay no income tax			1
" opinion : real conservatives can say they 're sorry it 's true that some @entity0 do n't pay federal income tax			1
but virtually all @entity0 pay some form of tax , whether it 's sales , payroll , state income , or property tax			1
over 60 % of those who do n't pay income tax are working ; they pay payroll tax , which goes to support @entity52 and @entity53			1
another 22 % of those who do n't pay income tax are the elderly ; most of them do n't work			1
in fact , only about 8 % of @entity0 pay neither federal income tax nor payroll tax , because they are unemployed , are students , or are disabled			1
what is missing from all this talk about tax is the fact that although the rich pay higher taxes than the poor , middle - class people actually pay a higher percentage of their income in total taxes			2
true , federal income tax rates are progressive , with rates going to 35 % for the top earners			1
but deductions and special treatment of capital gains reduce actual tax rates for the top earners			0
so what we end up with is upper - middle - class taxpayers paying the highest actual percentage of their income , over 31 % , according to a 2010 study by the group @entity83			0
how did our tax system get so flat ? the payroll tax for @entity52 is 12.4 % ( split between employer and employee )			2
it 's highly regressive , because only the first $ 110,100 of income is taxed			0
ceos earning over $ 35 million per year have paid their entire annual social security tax bill before the end of their workday on january 2 , while regular workers see this tax deducted from every check throughout the year			0
billionaire @entity97 points out that he pays a tax rate of only 17.8 % , compared with his secretary 's rate of 35.8 %			2
why ? because payroll taxes are capped and he gets a lower rate on his capital gains			0
president @entity105 pushed to pass the " @entity107 " to help reduce this disparity , but @entity7 's vice-presidential running mate , rep. @entity108 , opposed the rule , calling support for it " class warfare			0
" as the @entity8 use the term " class warfare , " they also bring forth , pointedly , details on the wide gap in income and wealth distribution in our country			0
digging deeper into why 47 % do n't pay federal income tax , what we find are many former taxpayers : twenty - two percent are the elderly , living mostly on @entity52 , a benefit they got by working and paying payroll taxes			1
others are unemployed or are paid close to the minimum wage , so they do n't have enough income to file any taxes			0
what about @entity7 's claim that these people believe they have a right to government assistance ? our research shows that over 50 % of older people looking for work ( but who are too young to collect @entity52 ) do not receive unemployment insurance or any other government assistance			1
they are living close to the poverty line with no help other than family			0
opinion : election winner faces a dangerous world far fewer poor @entity0 get government assistance for low incomes			0
for the last 30 years , less than 4 % of the @entity0 population has received a full year 's worth of payments , like food stamps , which are based on level of income			2
@entity7 can choose whom he cares about , but he ca n't be allowed to choose his own facts and distort reality in service of divisive politics			0
focusing exclusively on federal income taxes hides the fact that most @entity0 pay plenty of other taxes			1
finally , @entity7 says that the 47 % ca n't be convinced to take " personal responsibility			1
" tell that to the single mother working the night shift to put her kids through school , or the 78 - year - old widow living on @entity52 , or the handicapped @entity177 war veteran who relies on government health care for his service to his country			0
along with millions of working @entity0 , they are paragons of personal responsibility , not @entity7 's caricature of self - pitying victims seeking to live off government benefits .			2

@entity188 , @entity189 : it 's true 47 % of people do n't pay income tax
@entity188 , @entity189 : but @entity0 are not moochers , as @entity7 implies
they say nearly all @entity0 pay some tax : sales , payroll , state income , or property tax
*authors* : many of those who do n't pay income tax are the elderly or unemployed
