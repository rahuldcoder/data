@entity0 -- president @entity3 took a key step in cementing his judicial legacy monday , nominating solicitor general @entity2 to replace retiring justice @entity6 on the @entity7			1
if confirmed , the 50 - year - old @entity2 will become the 112th @entity7 justice			1
she would be the third woman on the nine - member bench and the fourth in the history of the court			2
at its discretion , the court decides cases on the @entity17 or federal law that may begin in federal or state courts			2
her confirmation also would mean that the @entity7 would have no @entity22 justices for the first time in its history			2
@entity2 , who is @entity25 , would join six @entity26 and two @entity25 justices ; @entity6 is @entity22			2
@entity2 , a @entity28 , was widely reported to be the front - runner for the nomination			1
she was a finalist for the high court vacancy last year , when justice @entity32 was selected to replace the retiring @entity33			1
@entity2 received her law degree from @entity35 , where she later served as dean of the law school			2
she served in the @entity39 administration as associate @entity41 counsel			0
fast facts : @entity2 @entity2 is a " trailblazing leader " who is " open to a broad array of viewpoints " and is a proven " consensus builder , " @entity3 said at the @entity41			2
" while we ca n't presume to replace @entity6 ' wisdom or experience , i have selected a nominee who i believe embodies that same excellence , independence , integrity and passion for the law , and who can ultimately provide that same kind of leadership on the court			0
" @entity2 , in turn , said she was " honored " and " humbled " by what she called " the honor of a lifetime			2
" " the court is an extraordinary institution in the work it does and the work it can do for the @entity69 people , " she said			0
it enables " all @entity69 , regardless of their background or their beliefs , to get a fair hearing and an equal chance at justice			0
" @entity3 did not have to look far when considering @entity2			2
as solicitor general , she is the administration 's top lawyer before the @entity7 and has argued several high - profile cases before the justices since taking the job in spring 2009			1
she also helps prepare legal briefs for cases the @entity83 argues before the @entity7			1
that work wo n't stop immediately with her nomination to the high court			1
" she will continue to work on matters with which she has been dealing , but will not participate in any new matters , " said a senior government official familiar with @entity2 's plans			1
@entity2 is expected to abstain from participation in cases on which she has worked that may come before the high court next term , the official said			1
she was confirmed for her current job by a 61 - 31 vote			0
while most @entity102 ultimately voted against her at the time , sen. @entity101 , a top @entity102 on the @entity103 , called her " a brilliant woman			2
" @entity105 on his former law school classmate @entity103 chairman @entity108 , @entity109 , said monday that @entity2 is a " superb nominee " who is " the best this country can offer			2
" " she will be confirmed , " he predicted			0
he dismissed likely @entity102 criticism of the choice , saying @entity3 " could nominate moses the lawgiver " and still face @entity102 opposition			2
@entity101 , in turn , promised in a statement monday to examine @entity2 's " entire record to understand her judicial philosophy			1
" " my conclusion will be based on evidence , not blind faith , " he said			0
senate minority leader @entity125 , @entity126 , reacted to the nomination by citing a traditional @entity102 concern with " activist " judges appointed by @entity131 presidents			0
another top @entity102 , however , indicated that the @entity103 @entity102 would probably not try to block a vote on @entity2 's nomination			1
" the only reason she would be filibustered is if members come to believe she could not put aside her own personal views on cases in which she wanted to see a particular outcome rather than decide the case on the basis of the facts and the law , " @entity136 sen. @entity135 said			0
@entity147 sen. @entity146 , the senior @entity102 on the @entity103 , said monday that @entity2 's confirmation hearings could wrap up by early august , but noted the timing depends on the @entity41 's willingness to work with the @entity102			1
republicans may try to use @entity2 's own words against her in pushing for greater specificity on her views during her confirmation hearings			1

" @entity2 's position on gays in the military is virtually certain to generate controversy during her confirmation hearings			1

the policy , enacted during the @entity39 administration but opposed by @entity3 , prohibits homosexuals from serving openly in the armed forces			0
while serving as dean at @entity172 , @entity2 said she " abhorred " the military 's " discriminatory recruitment policy			1
" she called it " a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order			0
" also in the spotlight will be @entity2 's views on the politically hot - button issue of campaign finance reform			1
she was the government 's lead attorney in arguing against a 5 - 4 @entity7 decision in january that eased long - standing restrictions on campaign spending by corporations and unions in federal elections			1
a number of conservatives praised the ruling as a victory for @entity194 free speech rights ; most democrats blasted it , arguing that it will tilt the political landscape favor of @entity102 and traditional @entity102 allies in the business community			0
some liberal organizations have expressed concern over @entity2 's views on executive power			1
as chief defender of the administration 's anti-terrorism strategy , @entity2 has articulated a more robust defense of the @entity41 than many civil rights and human rights groups would like			1
@entity209 , head of the left - leaning @entity210 , said @entity2 's record " indicates a troubling support for expanding presidential powers , something we must be vigilant about at this time			1
" " president @entity3 would appear to be seeking to appoint a @entity216 who will endorse his policies and appease conservatives , " he argued			0
" this is not the way to make a decision that will affect our nation for decades to come			0

@entity39 picked her in 1999 for the powerful @entity249			0

the seat was later filled by @entity253 , who quickly used the appointment as a springboard to chief justice			0
named @entity35 's dean in 2003 , @entity2 earned a reputation for soothing longstanding tensions over a perceived liberal tilt to the faculty and curriculum			2

such hires eased ideological unrest on the @entity35 campus			0
