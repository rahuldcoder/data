-- since she was a college student , @entity1 dreamed of running a @entity3 company			1
she finally achieved that goal last year when her company @entity5 exceeded sales of $ 6 billion for the first time , making her one of only 21 women to run a company in the coveted @entity3 list			1
" over a 35 year career , i got there , " said @entity12 , chief executive , chairman and president of @entity5			1
" when we became a @entity3 company a year ago when our sales hit over six billion , i have to say that was my dream , it was very satisfying to fulfil that dream			1
" in the four years since @entity12 joined @entity5 -- which makes food additives such as starches and corn syrup - its share price has gone from $ 25 to $ 60			1
" we 're a very global company with over 11,000 people , " she said			2
" so really my job entails not only running the company from our @entity33 base but really getting out into the field and to our 40 different factories			2
" " it 's a 24/7 job			2
i love it , and i 've built on my whole career to be ready for a position like this			0
" her achievement is even more remarkable given the company has faced a public backlash over one of its staple products , high - fructose corn syrup , which many people blame for rising obesity			1
when @entity12 joined the company -- then called @entity51 -- in 2009 , she quickly diversified into other products , acquired @entity5 and changed its name to @entity5 to reflect its new focus			1
" we really diversified and actually only 14 % of our sales globally are focused on high fructose for the soft drink industry , " said @entity12			1
" it is a perception problem and high fructose and sugar are really the same dynamics , " said @entity12			1
" consumers really want healthy food , and so it became clear that to grow the company why not grow with this trend of people looking for health and nutrition type ingredients			0
" so we 've made acquisitions , and we 've diversified away from that and really have grown the company with modified starches that really provide a very healthy ingredient			2
" @entity12 , born in 1953 , studied math at @entity78 in the 1970s , originally intending to be a high school math teacher			1
" instead i met these incredible women that were going to be lawyers , doctors , and phds in nutrition and science , " she said			2
" it really influenced me to say ' wait a minute			0
i can do more than teach			0
' which was a traditional field			0
and that 's when i decided to go into business			0
" @entity12 earned a masters degree in business and decided to go into manufacturing because there were so few women , and she felt it was an opportunity to be a " pioneer "			1
this eventually led to her first ceo role , heading up @entity104 , a division of @entity105			0
" they wanted me to move to @entity107 and make a decision in 48 hours			0
my family was in @entity33 , and i did n't know quite how we would make it happen			0
but it was a great opportunity to be a global ceo of a six and half billion dollar company , and i said ' i 'll take it , and i 'll figure it out			0
" @entity12 has never been afraid of standing out			1
at school , she complained to her principal about being forced to take sewing and cooking classes with the girls , and instead took shop lessons with the boys			0
later , at @entity78 , she was outnumbered by more than 10 to one by men			0
" i 've always pushed ahead and been a pioneer in everything that i 've done , " she said .			2

@entity1 is one of only 21 women running @entity3 companies
she grew and diversified the firm after *controversy* over high - fructose corn syrup
@entity12 entered manufacturing to be a " pioneer " among women
