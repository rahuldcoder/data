-- saying it is " unfair for @entity4 taxpayers to subsidize drug addiction , " gov. @entity1 on tuesday signed legislation requiring adults applying for welfare assistance to undergo drug screening			1
" it 's the right thing for taxpayers , " @entity1 said after signing the measure			1
" it 's the right thing for citizens of this state that need public assistance			0
we do n't want to waste tax dollars			1
and also , we want to give people an incentive to not use drugs			0
" under the law , which takes effect on july 1 , the @entity4 @entity22 will be required to conduct the drug tests on adults applying to the federal @entity28 program			2
the aid recipients would be responsible for the cost of the screening , which they would recoup in their assistance if they qualify			0
those who fail the required drug testing may designate another individual to receive the benefits on behalf of their children			1
shortly after the bill was signed , five democrats from the state 's congressional delegation issued a joint statement attacking the legislation , one calling it " downright unconstitutional			2
" " governor @entity1 's new drug testing law is not only an affront to families in need and detrimental to our nation 's ongoing economic recovery , it is downright unconstitutional , " said rep. @entity44			1
" if governor @entity1 wants to drug test recipients of @entity28 benefits , where does he draw the line ? are families receiving @entity58 , state emergency relief , or educational grants and loans next ? " rep. @entity62 said the tests " represent an extreme and illegal invasion of personal privacy			1
" " indeed , investigating people when there is probable cause to suspect they are abusing drugs is one thing , " @entity62 said in the joint statement			0
" but these tests amount to strip searching our state 's most vulnerable residents merely because they rely on the government for financial support during these difficult economic times			0
" joining in the statement denouncing the measure were @entity80 reps			0
@entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			0
controversy over the measure was heightened by @entity1 's past association with a company he co-founded that operates walk - in urgent care clinics in @entity4 and counts drug screening among the services it provides			1
in april , @entity1 , who had transferred his ownership interest in @entity94 to a trust in his wife 's name , said the company would not contract for state business , according to local media reports			2
he subsequently sold his majority stake in the company , local media reported			0
on may 18 , the @entity102 ruled that two conflict - of - interest complaints against @entity1 were legally insufficient to warrant investigation , and adopted an opinion that no " prohibited conflict of interest " existed			0
also on tuesday , @entity1 also signed a measure outlawing hallucinogenic designer drugs known as " bath salts			1
" " the chemical substances found in ' bath salts ' constitute a significant threat to health and public safety , " the governor 's office said in a statement			1
" poison control centers in @entity4 have reported 61 calls of ' bath salts ' abuse , making @entity4 the state with the second - highest volume of calls			2
" the drugs " are readily available at convenience stores , discount tobacco outlets , gas stations , pawnshops , tattoo parlors , and truck stops , among other locations , " the governor 's office said .			0
