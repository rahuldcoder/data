it was the day after @entity1 , and @entity2 had just left his son 's wedding			1
he 'd had two drinks but was n't buzzed , and he and his girlfriend were in a " great mood " -- headed to a nice bed and breakfast in @entity10 , @entity11 , where they planned to enjoy a bottle of wine , he told police			2
a stop at a @entity18 gas station would flip the happy day on its head			0
his car doors and windows shut , he was annoyed by the " heavy bass " coming from a nearby suv and asked four teens to turn it down			0
he heard what might have been a threat , @entity2 told police , then saw what might have been a gun			1
he pulled a 9mm handgun from his glove compartment and fired four times			0
he picked up his girlfriend as she came out of the convenience store and fled the scene , not realizing one of his eight bullets had killed 17 - year - old @entity38 , @entity2 told police interrogators			1
the couple continued on to @entity10 , where they checked into their room and ordered pizza but did n't call police , @entity2 said			1
opening statements are expected to begin thursday in @entity2 's trial			1
he has pleaded not guilty to first - degree murder in @entity38 ' death and to three counts of attempted first - degree murder for shooting at three teens accompanying @entity38			2
@entity2 has told police fear for his safety drove his actions that day			1
though jury selection has lasted three days -- after which the judge is expected to order that the jurors be sequestered -- the trial should proceed quickly and should n't last past february 14 , two days before what would have been @entity38 ' 19th birthday , said @entity62 , an attorney for the family			0
@entity2 's attorney , @entity64 , said that as of tuesday evening he had filed no motion to dismiss the charges based on @entity11 's stand your ground law , which received national attention during the @entity71 trial			1
" we are relying on @entity75 of @entity76 as an affirmative defense , " @entity64 said in an e-mail to @entity73			0
@entity2 explains shooting in a police interrogation video filmed the day after the shooting , @entity2 tells a police interviewer that the november 23 , 2012 , incident began when he asked four teens to turn down the music emanating from their @entity85			1
... i said , ' hey , would you guys mind turning that down ? ' they shut it off , and i was like , ' thank you , ' " @entity2 tells police			1
one of the passengers became " agitated , " @entity2 further explains , and someone turned the music back up			2
@entity2 says he was n't sure if the teens were singing , but he heard someone say , " kill him , " so he rolled down his window and asked if they were talking about him			1
" it was like , um , ' kill that bitch , ' " @entity2 says , claiming that he saw one of the @entity85 's occupants produce what looked like a shotgun and open the vehicle 's door			1
asked later if he was certain he saw a gun , he replies , " i saw a barrel come up on the window , like a single - shot shotgun ... it was either a barrel or a stick			1
" " i 'm sh * * * ing bricks , but that 's when i reached in my glove box , unholstered my pistol ... and so quicker than a flash i had a round chambered in it , and i shot , " he says , adding that he has owned the 9mm handgun since 1990 and " always " keeps it fully loaded in his glove compartment			2
he initially fired his weapon four times , @entity2 tells police , and the @entity85 began to pull away			1
" i was still scared and so i shot four more times ... trying to keep their heads down to not catch any return fire			0
and that was it , " he says			0
his girlfriend exited the convenience store to see what was happening , and @entity2 told her , " ' get in the car			1
' i did n't feel safe there , " he recalls during the interrogation			0
pizza not police the couple had plans at a " fairly expensive " bed and breakfast in @entity10 , 40 miles south of @entity18 , so they drove there and ordered pizza			1
@entity2 did n't call police , he says , because he wanted to go back to his @entity148 home , another 130 miles south of @entity10			1
@entity2 " was waiting till we get around people we know " to call authorities , and he wanted to ensure " our dog and everybody were where they needed to be			2
i did not want to bring a s * * tstorm down on them in @entity18 , " he tells interrogators			0
in hindsight , he says , he should n't have left the scene , but he was too afraid to stay			0
" i went over this a million times , and what i should 've done is put the car in reverse " to escape the confrontation , he says , but " it was fight or flight			0
i do n't think there was any time for flight at that moment			0
i was going to get shot			0
" one of the police interrogators tells @entity2 , " i will be the first to tell you that there are no weapons in that car			2
i do n't know what you saw			0
" " is it possible when they drove off they dumped it ? " @entity2 asks			2
" they never left the parking lot , " the officer replies			0
" they drove off , circled right back around and came right back to that spot			0
" toward the end of the interview , one interrogator tells @entity2 , " there are clear - cut cases where you go , ' yup , sure did , buddy			2
' " adds the other interrogator , " let me be the first to tell you , this ai n't one of them			0
" @entity71 redux ? while some observers are drawing parallels between @entity2 's trial and the case involving @entity208 and @entity71 -- not the least of which being that state attorney @entity210 is the prosecutor in both -- @entity71 's former attorney says he does n't see many similarities outside of the racial factor			1
@entity38 was black and @entity2 is white			2
" @entity71 was quite injured , and there were witnesses to suggest that there was an ongoing , physical confrontation and fight			0
compare that to the @entity2 case , where you have a verbal altercation , " said attorney @entity219 , a @entity73 contributor			2
as for @entity2 's claim of self - defense , @entity219 said he feels @entity2 will face the burden of answering a key doubt among jurors : " you were in a car			1
put it in drive , get out of there and then call the cops rather than take out a weapon and put eight shots into a car , killing one person			0
" @entity38 's mother , @entity240 , said the time since her son 's death has been " the most difficult , challenging year of my life , the most painful year of my life " -- something she 'd wish on no parent -- but she 's found some solace using her platform to speak out against gun violence in the nation			1
" the gun culture , at this point , i believe is really fueling a lot of fear			0
citizens are in fear of one another , fear of people that they do n't know , people that do n't think like them , look like them , act like them , " she said in a @entity73 interview last month			0
she said she thinks about the @entity71 case " all the time " and she 's concerned that @entity2 is following @entity71 's lead in claiming self - defense as an immunity and could " possibly walk away free			1
" @entity2 's former attorney , @entity269 , previously told @entity73 , " when all the evidence has been flushed out , i believe that it will be extremely clear that mr. @entity2 acted as any responsible firearm owner would have under the same circumstances , " @entity268 said			1
shooting is no @entity208 case , attorney says			0

@entity2 says he and girlfriend fled scene of shooting , went to @entity280 and ordered pizza
" justifiable use of deadly force , " not stand your ground , is defense , attorney says
@entity2 shot after seeing shotgun , he says ; the police say teens were *unarmed*
mom of shooting *victim* says it 's been " the most difficult , challenging year of my life "
