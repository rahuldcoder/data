@entity0 -- @entity3 's @entity2 made a rare public apology wednesday for his recent hunting trip to @entity6 that has caused an outcry in @entity3 and abroad for its expense during the nation 's economic crisis and for hunting elephants			1
" i am very sorry			0
i made a mistake and it wo n't happen again , " the king told @entity3 state television @entity13 as he left a @entity0 hospital , where he underwent hip surgery last weekend after falling on the hunting trip in @entity17			1
the trip was intended to be a private outing for the 74 - year - old king , unknown to the media and most @entity3 , until he was rushed back to @entity0 and underwent replacement surgery on his right hip			1
in his brief apology , the king did not mention the hunting trip , but state television and other @entity3 media reported that he was clearly referring to that			1
@entity3 generally hold the king in high regard for his service to the nation and his defense of democracy after the death of the dictator @entity38 in 1975 -- especially the king 's decisive stand to halt a right - wing military coup in 1981			1
but after news emerged of the expensive hunting trip , with widespread @entity3 media reports that it included the hunting of elephants , even normally - staunch political allies of the monarch said publicly that they considered the timing of the trip a mistake			1
some called on him to apologize			0
earlier wednesday , speculation was rife in @entity3 media that he would do so upon leaving the hospital , where doctors said in a medical report that he is recovering well from the hip surgery			1
the king said he will resume his responsibilities			0
his son , crown prince @entity65 , has stood in for him at some events this week while he was in the hospital			0
the criticism of the trip initially focused on the expensive safari in the midst of the nation 's deep crisis , with 23 % unemployment , 5 million @entity3 out of work , and the government applying austerity cuts and tax increases to make up for budget shortfalls			1
the king himself had previously expressed his concern over the impact of the crisis on @entity3 and called on the nation to come together to get through the tough times			1
the royal household has a budget of 8.26 million euros ( $ 10.8 million ) this year , 2 % less than last year , and had recently announced cuts of about $ 222,000 , including trimming salaries of the highest - paid staffers at the royal palace			0
some critics also wondered how much public money was spent for security on the king 's private trip			1
the criticism later included animal rights activists , as reports emerged that the king was hunting elephants			2
at least one photo , said to be from an earlier trip , showed the king , rifle in hand , standing in front of a dead elephant			2
it was widely published last weekend in @entity3 media , which said it was taken from the website of an african safari outfitter , and that the photo was later removed from the company 's site			2
the criticism of the king comes amid frequent mention of the royal household in the news lately , much of it in an uncustomary unflattering light			0
earlier this month , the king 's 13 - year - old grandson shot himself in the foot with a shotgun during target practice with his father , who is divorced from the king 's eldest daughter , princess @entity130			2
the legal age in @entity3 to handle firearms , even when accompanied by an adult , is 14			0
and the king 's son - in - law , @entity135 , who is married to the youngest daughter , @entity137 , is a suspect in a financial fraud scandal in which public funds earmarked for his foundation allegedly were diverted for private use			2
but last december , the royal household said @entity135 would not take part in official ceremonies , which is a key role for members of the royal family			0
@entity135 and his family were not present at @entity149 for the royal family 's traditional photo			0
also last december , the royal family publicly revealed its finances for the first time in an effort to boost public confidence and transparency .			0
