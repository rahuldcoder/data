@entity0 -- the foreign invasion of @entity4 's professional football league reached fever pitch this week with the announcement that former @entity8 forward @entity7 will play with the @entity10 team next season			1
" @entity7 will be the highest profile player to join the @entity15 , " said @entity13 sports commentator @entity12			1
" he is going to get about 12 million euro ( us $ 15 million ) per season , the highest salary ever offered by @entity4 sport			1
" this continues the spending spree on foreign coaches and players by @entity4 tycoons who have been acquiring sports teams for commercial and branding purposes			1
last year reigning champions @entity25 imported a @entity27 superstar who led the team to the championship			2
in may , the team pulled off another coup by securing the services of @entity33 - winning @entity35 coach @entity34			2
bankrolled by @entity36 , a charismatic tycoon who co-owns @entity37 , an online games company , @entity10 has been languishing near the bottom of the @entity15 , with only three wins in 13 games			1
@entity4 soccer : @entity43 project or emerging superpower ? @entity7 , 34 , will join his former @entity8 teammate @entity45 in the attacking line of the @entity48 team			1
@entity7 says he decided to move to @entity48 to experience a new culture , promote @entity4 football around the world , and further improve @entity53 relations			1
" when @entity8 went to @entity4 last year , we had a great time and met some amazing fans , " he wrote on his personal website			1
football is considered the no. 1 spectator sport in @entity4			1
large crowds go to games and even larger audiences watch televised games featuring teams in professional leagues at home and in @entity35 , @entity67 and @entity68			2
but interest in soccer has waned in recent years			0
this is partly due to the scandals that have plagued the " beautiful game			1
" last week , two former top officials of @entity4 's football association and four ex-members of the national team were convicted of corruption and match - fixing			1
they were sentenced to long prison terms			0
poor performances by @entity4 's national teams have n't helped the cause either			1
@entity4 has repeatedly failed to qualify for the @entity33 , prompting popular frustration and anger			1
in 2010 , after the game that doomed @entity4 's chances of qualifying for the @entity33 , a local newspaper ran a large , bold black headline , " @entity90			1
we have nothing to @entity93			0
" that year , @entity4 was ranked 84th in the world , just ahead of @entity95			1
there has been little progress since then			0
in november last year , @entity98 was again eliminated from their 2014 world cup qualifying group			0
qualification for the @entity33 remains an elusive goal , and the fans are not happy			0
i have seen @entity4 soccer fans get angry when their team loses			1
in may 1985 , minutes after an underdog @entity109 team knocked @entity4 out of contention for the 1986 @entity33 , hundreds of angry fans stormed onto the field and besieged the winning team -- and the home team			1
outside the @entity0 stadium , mobs went on a rampage , smashing vehicles and attacking journalists and diplomats			0
it was the worst sports riot in decades			0
some china - watchers suggested it was a cathartic release of pent - up emotions over social and political controls and other complaints , coupled with an ugly display of jingoism			0
others viewed it as evidence of simple fans ' disappointment at their national team			0
with no home team to root for , @entity4 fans have turned to other teams overseas â€” or to local teams featuring international idols			1
" i bought @entity7 to make supporters happy , " @entity10 owner @entity36 wrote in his microblog			1
" i believe his professionalism is not just on the field -- his other strengths will also have a great impact on other players			2
his values are many , he has an international vision as well as international recognition			0
" fans hailed the move			0
" it is a good thing for @entity4 football and fans , " wrote @entity151			1
" @entity156 - shot players will definitely improve attendance in stadiums , boost ratings and bring considerable commercial benefits			2
" it is not a novel idea			0
in 1975 , @entity164 super-hero @entity163 signed with the @entity165 and for years he gave the nascent professional soccer scene in the @entity168 massive publicity and a significant boost in popularity			0
in 2007 , @entity171 left @entity172 to join @entity174 team @entity173			2
@entity171 , then 31 , signed a multi-year , multi-million - dollar deal that included sponsorship and merchandising contracts			0
" they worked in the sense that everyone made a lot of money , and they helped raise the profile of soccer in @entity168 and the @entity168 league abroad , " said @entity179 writer @entity178			0
" there 's no magic bullet , however			0
the @entity168 league is still growing , but slowly , " he added			0
but sports analysts wonder if importing big - name stars necessarily boost the teams commercially or competitively			2
@entity12 says it made sense for @entity199 's @entity25 team			0
" they were doing the @entity202 model , " he explained			0
" they made huge investment into the first team to gain instant result on the pitch and thus promote @entity25 's brand in @entity4 and @entity209			1
" but @entity12 finds @entity48 's strategy off - target			0
" @entity48 is a weak team , even though the club has some pedigree			0
signing @entity7 and @entity45 would not make @entity48 a top team because it takes more than two world - class strikers to make a powerful team			1
" to give @entity4 's soccer a genuine boost , @entity12 said , " the key is grassroots participation and youth development			2
" @entity223 , the managing editor of @entity224 , said importing big names " is only good for @entity4 sports if more big businesses and rich entrepreneurs wanted to get involved with sports in @entity4			1
the reality is , however , that many of them do n't want to			0
" commercial goals aside , @entity233 , formerly a professional basketball player in @entity4 and now a business professor at @entity235 in @entity236 , believes getting @entity7 is largely a vanity project			1
" i think it is a stunt for @entity48 to reposition its city 's image in @entity4 and the world in the @entity244 era			2
" @entity233 likens it to the concept of bringing formula 1 racing to @entity48 , which over the years has failed to gain popular and commercial appeal			0
" i voiced my concern but they went ahead anyway , " he said			0
" looking back , it 's clear that the @entity253 race track was only for face - lifting of @entity48			0
" still , @entity233 adds , " with sophisticated planning and marketing schemes , perhaps it could serve as a steroid to jump - start the fan 's interest in football			2
" the problem is , the fans lack a connection with soccer because of its credibility issue			0
the soccer league is a mirror of the worst in @entity4 , as evidenced in the news reports on corruption			1
" perhaps microblogger @entity271 puts @entity4 's soccer conundrum most poignantly : " i 've often seen kids playing on cement ground , " he wrote			2
" some of them may have superstar quality but they are unfortunately born in @entity4			2
" @entity4 has plenty of money but nobody would even build one small field for the kids to play on			2
stars can temporarily save the market but contribute little to the future of @entity4 football			1

former @entity8 forward @entity7 will join @entity10 next season
@entity4 tycoons are spending big on foreign coaches and players
football is considered the number one spectator sport in @entity4
however support is waning due to corruption scandals , poor performance
