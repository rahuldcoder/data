-- we have many heroes : historic figures who battled for freedom , a man who jumps on the railway tracks to save someone from certain death , a whistle - blower who identifies corruption in government or industry			2
while these forms of heroism focus on a willingness to take risks in the service of other people or noble ideals , the most ancient notion of heroism focuses on humanity 's ability to transcend its own physical limitations			1
occasionally , there is a man or woman who appears to be almost superhuman in strength and physical ability			2
the @entity32 had @entity33 and @entity34			0
up until yesterday , we had @entity35			1
it is unlikely that we will ever know the truth about @entity35 's situation -- was it truly a heroic journey , battling his own body 's limits to demonstrate the pinnacle of human capability -- despite the intense personal costs of competing in the @entity44 ? or was it a tainted attempt to win glory ? and why ca n't it ever be simple -- why ca n't we have a hero who is beyond reproach ? cyclists say ' good riddance ' as a researcher who focuses on heroic action and the ascription of heroic status , i know that heroism is rarely simple			1
in fact , in a paper that i authored with my colleagues @entity59 and dr. @entity61 , we argued that heroism is fundamentally paradoxical			2
first , the action of heroism is typically an intensely private and personal endeavor , even when these actions are taken under the glaring spotlight of the media ; but the ascription of heroic status is a fundamentally public activity -- the personal actions taken by one individual are observed and interpreted by others , rightly or wrongly			1
if we consider the possibility that @entity35 's 500 - plus drug tests were negative as an indicator that he never doped , this is an incredible testament not just to his physical strength , but his moral fortitude			1
if this is the case , he was able to resist an ongoing temptation that occurred in private , after all the cameras where off and the fans had gone home			2
this brings us to our second paradox			2
it is human nature to at once hunger for and elevate exemplars of heroism , while we simultaneously often want to negate the actual actions of a real hero			1
one of the implications of our research is that all forms of heroism result in some level of controversy ; seeing someone run into a burning building to save another may look heroic to one bystander but foolish to another			1
@entity35 faces lifetime ban a lot rides on the outcome			1
if a woman who goes into a building is successful in rescuing the trapped victim in the inferno , she is a hero			0
but if she fails , or she is injured , the risk she took is seen as having been too great , even though the actual risk calculus she took in the moment of action does not change			0
moreover , someone willing to act heroically fundamentally challenges our own notions of ourselves			0
heroes are , in some ways , subtly dangerous to our sense of social order			2
even though they are human , just like the rest of us , their actions are outside of the normal human experience			0
if there is a whistleblower in our office -- even if his or her motives are noble -- it is human nature to search for an alternative explanation			0
maybe this person was really disgruntled at the boss			0
with @entity35 , there is a natural tendency , perhaps in all of us , to say , " see , i told you so , no one could be that good			1
" the sad part of @entity35 's story -- of the titles being stripped away -- is that we lose either way			1
if he did dope , it is just another example in a recent string of high - profile heroic failures			2
@entity152 's career , built up over many years of good decisions , was washed away by an incident he should have acted on			0
the captain of the @entity157 's momentary lapse led to the deaths of 32 people ; abandoning ship before his passengers led to his disgrace			0
but if @entity35 did n't dope , it wo n't matter			1
the news cycles will have already done their work			0
there is doubt now , and that is often the beginning of the end of our willingness to attach the word " hero " to someone in our own minds			0
we have lost a figure who was willing to challenge the limits of human performance , to show us what we are truly capable of if we put everything we have into accomplishing a seemingly insurmountable goal			0
@entity35 's story of setbacks and triumphs brought us closer to the essence of the human endeavor			1
what 's behind the @entity35 headlines ? while it is easy to say that one slip - up means someone ca n't be hero , it is also important for us to remember that negating all of this person 's actions over a few mistakes also lets us off the hook			1
no hero is without flaws			0
but if we allow ourselves the luxury of saying , " see , he 's just like the rest of us , " we no longer have to challenge ourselves to perform at the limits of our own personal capability			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			1

@entity210 : sometimes we pick heroes who , like @entity35 , transcend physical limitations
but heroism a paradox : it 's private , but it acquires the heroic label as a public activity , he says
at the same time humans hunger for heroic exemplars of heroism , while negating real heroism
@entity210 : if we revel in @entity35 's fall as *equalizing* , we let ourselves off the hook for heroism
