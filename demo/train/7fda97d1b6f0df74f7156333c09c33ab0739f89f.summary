-- women have finally arrived			0
from @entity5 to @entity6 to @entity7 , writers , academics , and business leaders are pointing to the empowerment of women as key to many of the world 's greatest challenges			1
they 're publicizing the research and amplifying hard facts , like the fact that when women have equal access to agricultural resources , 100 million to 150 million fewer people will go hungry			1
or that when women participate equally in the workforce , the gdp in the @entity24 the eurozone , and @entity26 will experience a double - digit spike			0
and while there 's no perfect metric for the popular perception of " girl power , " a 2010 @entity29 study found widespread public support for women 's equality in virtually every nation			1
the excitement over women 's potential and progress is warranted			1
but there 's still a large and disappointing disconnect between research and reality			1
girls and women do indeed perform 66 % of the work and produce 50 % of the world 's food			1
but they earn only 10 % of the world 's income and own a dismal 1 % of its property			1
and women everywhere experience less access to credit , training , technology , markets , role models , and protection under the law			0
girls and women may keep the world running , but someone else is still running the show			1
so if women have indeed " arrived , " despite key indicators showing continued widespread inequality , where exactly have they landed ? all signs point to girls and women at a tipping point			0
with leaders finally paying attention to their issues , women are miles ahead of where they once were			0
but they are also far from where they need to be			0
and women wo n't get past the tipping point and onto a level economic playing field until we all ensure that their economic empowerment is a sustainable path forward rather than a fad or figment of the global imagination			1
leaders across various sectors must approach girls and women as actors who drive solutions , not just as beneficiaries who receive their results			2
we need a shift in strategy and investment to help women around the world to mobilize themselves and their communities			2
the moment is ripe for action			0
mid-september is the geopolitical busy season , and leaders from around the globe have descended on @entity109 for the @entity110 , the @entity111 , and other global meetings , where girls and women will undoubtedly be a hot topic			1
for the first time , this game of empowerment has all the cards stacked on the right side : the relevant players , from corporations to governments and nongovernmental organizations , are beginning to recognize that it 's time to " invest in women			2
members of the @entity111 are promoting innovative solutions			2
through its @entity130 and @entity131 program , retailer @entity128 helps female garment workers build both life and technical skills , offering managerial and financial literacy training so that they can advance in the workplace			0
and that will help them make progress in their careers and lives			0
through @entity145 's partnership with the @entity5 - based research institute the @entity146 and local @entity147 , 7,600 women have completed the @entity145 program in seven countries			1
@entity150 is putting women in the driver 's seat as well , boldly pledging to make more than half of its senior management team female by 2015			2
with women controlling nearly $ 12 trillion of the overall $ 18.4 trillion in global consumer spending , it 's just good business sense for a global consumer goods company to guarantee itself a leadership that reflects its consumers			2
leaders can also look to the approach taken by the @entity167 in the @entity168 , which is integrating initiatives for women 's advancement into the @entity24 ' foreign policy and the duties of every @entity24 diplomat abroad			0
and it has built partnerships with the private sector to mentor and train thousands of women who own small and medium - sized businesses in @entity180 , @entity181 and elsewhere around the world , to combat gender - based violence , and to provide prenatal education to mothers in developing countries			0
if the world is truly to mine the untapped potential of women , and bring greater social and economic progress to our societies , then all sectors of society -- government , business , civil -- must work together			1
not just because women will reap the benefits , but because everyone stands to benefit			0
none of us will truly arrive until girls and women leap over the tipping point , too			0

the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 and @entity212 .			1

@entity211 and @entity212 : empowering women will help the world
they say research shows that women perform more of world 's work but earn far less than men
they say @entity111 promotes partnering with companies to lift up women
writers : all sectors of society must work to integrate women for social and economic gains
