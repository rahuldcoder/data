-- the blue neon light of a @entity3 comedy club appears blurry in the lens of @entity6 's hd camcorder as he steadies it in his hand			0
it 's almost 9 p.m. on a tuesday , and he is shooting his documentary after a full day of classes at the @entity12			1
he adjusts the focus to bring his subject into clear view , the way his instructors trained him			0
meanwhile , his colleague and good friend , @entity20 , holds the boom mic up and out of the shot as @entity6 begins his interview			0
the techniques they 're putting to practice are the same as they will use when they return to their home in @entity28 , @entity29 , to produce television for the @entity29 people			1
" we do n't have any professional production school in @entity29 , " @entity20 said			1
" i need to make some professional commercials to change tv and change the people 's minds over there from being basic to being professional			2
" @entity6 and @entity20 , both 24 , arrived in @entity39 from @entity29 in june to study for six weeks at one of the premiere film schools			1
the @entity12 program , now in its second year , enrolls just two @entity29 students in cinema courses during the summer for a crash course in storytelling , camera techniques , lighting , editing and commercial production			1
saving face : the struggle and survival of @entity29 women " what we 're able to do is bring two people who have had sparse training in broadcasting , bring them here and turn them loose in a film class that lasts six weeks and it 's intensive , " said @entity55 , director of the @entity56			1
the program is largely funded by former @entity65 ceo @entity64 , who owns a private company that invests and consults in the media and entertainment businesses			2
but in the 1970s , @entity64 was in the clothing business , living and working in @entity28 , where he developed a lasting connection to @entity29			1
" i was lucky enough to have lived there and build a great affinity and understanding for the people , who i think are kind of misrepresented in the world in the last 10 , 20 , 30 years , " @entity64 said			0
" this is a moment for them to continue to really move forward and break out and join the world community			0
" in light of the ongoing conflict that news organizations center on , @entity20 and @entity6 have wondered how their classmates view the country they call home			0
" i 've asked my class fellows and also i 've asked my professor about it , " @entity20 said			0
" and they 're still thinking that about the @entity90 and the @entity91 , but i told them no , actually it 's not the same thing now			1
@entity29 is totally changed now			1
" the tv industry is at a critical juncture in @entity29			1
under the @entity90 , there was no television , and today 60 % of people have access to broadcast media , according to @entity55			1
it has increasingly become the primary source of entertainment and information for @entity29 , he said			1
more than half the population is still illiterate , but @entity64 said @entity29 are discovering educational value in a show with which many @entity109 are familiar : " @entity110			2
" " we find there 's a very big adult population that watches that and learns how to count and speak			0
" " people in @entity29 do n't go out a lot for dinner , they do n't have a lot of the leisure activities that we do , so they stay home and watch television , " @entity64 said , adding that sometimes families rely on car batteries to power their television sets			2
with a sense of the power of television to create a sense of national unity , @entity64 and the program administrators hope @entity6 and @entity20 will hit the ground running in @entity29 and have an immediate effect on the growing audience of television consumers			1
" these two young men are going to go back into that world and further accelerate that change through the very effective medium of television by creating television in @entity29 by @entity29 for @entity29 , " @entity64 said			2
" when i go back to my country , i will share everything that i learned here with my colleagues , " @entity6 said			0
" that will help them also to work professionally in production and for tv and media			2
" @entity6 's documentary , " an engineer became a @entity152 , " deals with the theme of following one 's passion rather than money			0
the film profiles a stand - up comic whose parents would n't pay for college unless he studied medicine , law or engineering			0
so he became an aerospace engineer by day and worked on perfecting his stand - up routine by night			0
" this same thing is happening also in @entity29 , " @entity6 said			2
" they push their daughter and son to study the field that their parents want			0
" " i am one of the lucky guys that always had my family support me to work in tv			0

student hopes to use tv to help those in @entity29
