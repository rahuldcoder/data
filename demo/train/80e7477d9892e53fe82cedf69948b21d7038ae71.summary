-- finally , it 's all over			0
i 'm pretty sure that is what a lot of @entity5 are thinking			0
none of us has ever been through anything like this , and it was not pleasant			0
while we appreciated having the national spotlight on us these past few months , the price was high			0
it was impossible to get away from the election			0
turn on the television , and political commercials , filled with shadowy pictures and foreboding music , were everywhere			0
turn off the tv and turn on a computer , and your ip address would betray that you were coming in from the @entity24 , and more ads would appear			1
try to escape into a book , and the phone would ring			0
toward the end of the campaign , most of us were getting about 10 calls every day			1
for all of the high - tech internet ads and targeted robocalls ( i had no idea i was on a first - name basis with so many politicians , but the calls often addressed either me or my wife directly ) , in the end , election day was almost comfortingly old - fashioned			1
candidates and their supporters stood outside the polling locations , usually churches or schools , handing out paper flyers hoping to persuade late deciders to support their candidates			0
inside the polling stations , dedicated poll workers -- the unsung heroes of @entity53 democracy -- tried their best to adapt to complex regulations governing who among their neighbors was and was not qualified to vote			0
ironically , given how much money was spent here , for the second presidential race in a row , @entity24 did not matter			1
@entity61 could have lost @entity24 and won the election			1
still , @entity24 , with its hefty chunk of electoral votes and predilection for voting for the eventual winner , will doubtless remain at the center of future presidential contests			1
although @entity24 once again voted for the winner ( a pattern that now extends to 1964 ) , those expecting a satisfying victory of one party over the other in @entity24 were disappointed			2
in its own gentle way , it was as if the @entity24 , like most voters across the country on tuesday night , was admonishing the nation to seek some sort of bipartisan consensus			2
while agreeing to give @entity61 a second term , @entity24 voters handed the president a much narrower victory than he had enjoyed four years earlier			1
in fact , if @entity87 had just done a bit better than @entity89 had in @entity24 , he would have won the state			2
and @entity24 voters showed their ambivalence by deciding to keep the state legislature solidly in @entity95 hands and to send republicans to @entity96 in 12 of @entity24 's 16 congressional districts			1
while @entity98 will argue that these @entity95 victories are more the result of political gerrymandering than clear voter intent , @entity5 also soundly rejected a ballot measure on tuesday that would have redistricting out of the hands of the legislature			2
while pundits have emphasized the importance of the auto bailout as essentially buying the votes of @entity24 auto workers and their families , the harsh headline of the @entity87 opinion piece that had been published in the @entity117 -- " let @entity107 go bankrupt " -- might have offended voters more than the president 's actions had earned their gratitude			2
over the past few years , @entity95 in @entity24 have shown themselves to be quite adept at offending voters			1
they did very well in the state 's midterm elections two years ago			0
after regaining total control of the @entity24 government , they passed a bill restricting the collective bargaining rights of nearly all public employees -- not only teachers and other government workers , as had been the case in @entity134 , but also police and firefighters			2
the bill was overwhelmingly defeated when placed on the ballot in november 2011 , and the @entity140 momentum generated by the legislation rolled into this year 's presidential contest			0
somewhat surprisingly , @entity95 spent almost no time in @entity24 rebuilding their support			1
although there was a massive @entity95 get - out - the - vote effort , little was done to repair the party 's brand name			2
one of the most obvious moves that @entity95 might have made would be to place moderate and widely popular @entity24 sen. @entity150 on the ticket in 2012 , instead of the more divisive @entity152			1
sixty - eight years ago , in the summer of 1944 , the @entity95 nominated @entity24 gov. @entity153 to be the vice-presidential candidate alongside presidential nominee @entity155			1
although the @entity95 ticket was crushed by @entity158 , it is interesting to note that @entity24 was one of only 12 states carried by the @entity95			1
it is hard not to credit @entity153 with delivering his home state			0
after all , @entity158 had never before lost @entity24			0
four years later , @entity155 , with his new running mate , @entity164 gov. @entity163 , would lose the @entity24 in an election that everyone expected him to win			2
if there was one @entity95 winner in @entity24 , it was probably portman			1
as @entity87 's practice partner for his debate preparations , @entity150 played a crucial role in @entity87 's success during the first presidential debate , the only event over the past few months that seemed to move the polls in @entity87 's direction			1
this was actually the fourth campaign in which @entity150 has played this role , and some @entity95 insiders are probably contemplating that perhaps it is time for @entity150 to be a presidential candidate rather than just playing one during debate practice			1
it does make some sense to have an @entity24 at the top of the ticket			0
after all , the one thing we can be sure of in 2016 is that , once again , all eyes will be on @entity24			0
but for those of us who make our home in the @entity24 , this is something that we would rather not think about right now			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			0

@entity197 : *ohioans* were *bombarded* with campaign ads and calls
@entity197 : in the end , @entity24 did not matter in @entity61 's *re-election*
he says if there was one @entity95 winner in @entity24 , it was probably sen. @entity150
@entity197 : maybe it 's time for @entity150 to be a presidential candidate in the next election
