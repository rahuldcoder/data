while @entity2 has long been the preserve of @entity4 - drinking revellers painting the world 's towns green while wearing shamrock hats , @entity1 @entity0 have always taken pride in their nation 's patron saint			1
now a new study from @entity12 based on his writings suggests @entity15 was not brought to @entity16 as a slave , as the legend has it , but that in fact he may actually have sold slaves his family owned to pay his way to @entity16 -- in order to avoid a job as a tax collector for the roman empire			1
the findings fly in the face of the classic account of the life of @entity15 , who grew up as a member of the @entity34 nobility in western @entity35 and was supposedly abducted and forced into slavery in @entity16 around 400 a.d. according to this history , @entity15 escaped and became a priest before having a vision and returning to @entity16 to convert the @entity1 to @entity40			1
legend has it @entity15 used the shamrock , now the national emblem of @entity16 , to explain the concept of the @entity46 , by showing an unbeliever the three - leafed plant with one stalk			1
the new study , based on @entity15 's own writings in their historical context , argues that @entity15 actually ended up in @entity16 in order to avoid becoming a " @entity54 , " or @entity34 tax collector -- a role in city government that had become undesirable and dangerous in @entity15 's time			1
" in the troubled era in which @entity15 lived , which saw the demise and eventual collapse of @entity34 government in @entity35 in 410 , discharging the obligations of a @entity68 , especially tax - collecting , would not only have been difficult but also very risky , " said dr. @entity59 , from the @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 at @entity12			2
@entity15 's father was a @entity70 , which was a hereditary role , and when he vacated his position in order to join the clergy , @entity59 says @entity15 chose to leave @entity35 to avoid being obligated to take up his father 's job			1
in order to get to @entity16 , which lacked a monetary system at the time , @entity15 would have needed to sell commodities to finance the trip			2
according to his writings , @entity15 's family owned several slaves -- a high value and easily transportable commodity -- and @entity59 says in the historical context it makes sense that @entity15 would convert his family wealth into slaves he could sell in order to pay his way			2
but @entity94 , author of the biography " @entity15 of @entity16 , " says while it is almost certain that @entity15 's family owned slaves , as many members of the @entity34 nobility did at the time , experts ' claims that @entity15 himself was a slave trader is reading too far into the sources			1
" it 's almost certain that @entity15 grew up surrounded by slaves , but there 's no good reason for thinking he was a slave trader , " @entity94 told @entity104			0
" the only sources we have about @entity15 that are really reliable are the two letters he wrote when he was an old man , " he said			0
" and both of those tell the story of a young man who grew up in the young @entity34 nobility in @entity35 , but was kidnapped when he was 16 years old			0
" @entity12 's @entity59 believes the widely accepted history of @entity15 's early life and kidnapping was largely concocted by @entity15 himself in those letters			0
" the traditional story that @entity15 was kidnapped from @entity35 , forced to work as a slave , but managed to escape and reclaim his status , is likely to be fiction : the only way out of slavery in this period was to be redeemed , and @entity15 was never redeemed			1
the traditional legend was instigated by @entity15 himself in the letters he wrote , because this is how he wanted to be remembered , " he said			0
@entity59 says it is only @entity15 's motives , and not his efforts to christianize the @entity16 people , that are up for debate			0
" none of this is to say that @entity15 was not a bishop or that he did not engage in missionary activity , but his primary motives for moving to @entity16 were most likely to escape the poisoned chalice of his inherited position in @entity35 , " he added			2
while very little is known about @entity15 , one legend has credited him with having driven the snakes out of @entity16			0
however , most biologists maintain there never were snakes in @entity16 .			0
