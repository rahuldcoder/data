-- " call of duty : @entity9 " continues the franchise 's tradition of high action , detailed fighting and a highly competitive multiplayer mode while still trying to let players play the way they want			1
the latest in the wildly successful series hits all the right notes in both its cinematic single - player campaign and its intense multiplayer mode			1
they also bring back the " special ops " mode from " @entity17 , " combining the best of both			2
the single - player campaign , while short , takes you hopping around the globe to major cities in the world 's most powerful countries			1
instead of battling in traditional hotspots ( i.e. , locales like @entity29 ) , the story puts the player in @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 to name a few			1
each city is richly detailed and the combat , against opponents run by a smart artificial - intelligence program , is intense			0
the pacing from city to city varies based on mission and storyline presented in each location			0
one city will be frantic while another city might be a bit slower			0
there are some unexpected , and tragic , moments played out in the single - player campaign 's story			1
but they combine to bring the " @entity9 " story to a satisfying end			0
i wish it would have lasted longer , but the plot flowed nicely			0
the " special ops " mode takes the intense @entity60 from the single - player game and adds elements that are usually found in multiplayer action			1
creative strategist @entity64 said the development team wanted to give people who normally only tackle the single - player campaign the opportunity to experience some of the rewards only found during online multiplayer play			1
" we noticed there were a lot of experiences that you were missing out on if you only played single player or , vice versa , you only played multiplayer , " @entity72 said			1
" we wanted to find a platform that allowed the type of player from each of those to have those shared experiences rather than missing out because it was n't their style of play			2
" sixteen missions tie in to the campaign			2
along the way , players earn credit for achievements like kill streaks and customizing weapons			0
there 's a progressive ranking system that lets even the most " lone wolf " player climb up the leaderboard			2
the survival mode is particularly grueling , with wave after wave of opponents coming after you			2
the core of the multiplayer action stays pretty true to the franchise 's roots			1
huge battles , lots of action and an experience - point system keep players involved and interested			2
most of the modes remain the same with one new additional mode			0
collecting tags from dead bodies adds a cool twist to straightforward killing of an opponent and actually promotes teamwork , something that 's lacking from time to time in multiplayer action			1
there are 16 new maps to set the scene of your victories			1
@entity72 said there are 30 million players who have played " @entity140 " online and a new @entity135 program will help provide stats , tips and bring together the franchise community without dividing them among consoles			0
he also tweeted on @entity141 that the game 's makers have already had to ban gamers from leaderboards -- and from playing altogether -- for trying to play unfairly or artificially boost their rankings			0
while the multiplayer mode has n't changed much , it never really needed to			1
the " @entity9 " franchise has a great track record of addictive online play that remains enjoyable and exciting			0
fast and furious multiplayer action , a cinematic single - player campaign and a @entity155 mode offering the experience of both takes " call of duty : @entity9 " to the top of the class			1
at least until the next one comes out			0
" @entity140 : @entity9 " is available now for the pc , @entity162 and @entity163			0
it is rated m for mature due to blood and gore , drug references , intense violence and strong language			0
this review was done using the @entity163 version .			0

the single player campaign puts you in places such as @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33
@entity155 mode takes the @entity60 from single player , adds elements from multiplayer action
there are 16 new maps to set the scene during *multipayer* action
