@entity24 's @entity11 moved up to second and his teammate @entity25 was promoted to third			0
@entity17 said in a statement : " inconsistencies with the @entity21 fuel flow meter have been prevalent all weekend up and down the pit lane			0
" the team and ( engine supplier ) @entity32 are confident the fuel supplied to the engine is in full compliance with the regulations			0
" @entity10 's teammate and world champion @entity8 suffered a sorry opening to the season			1

the same fate also befell @entity9 , who was passed by his @entity49 teammate @entity1 off the start and retired after only three laps			1
a crash on the first corner saw @entity55 's return to @entity4 with @entity56 come to abrupt end , taking out an unhappy @entity58 in the @entity59			2
@entity58 's teammate @entity60 showed the car was competitive , charging through the field until he brushed the wall on the 10th lap. debris from the crash meant the safety car was deployed , although @entity68 's @entity60 was able to recover to finish a fine sixth			2
all the while the unflappable @entity1 was never under any serious challenge as he raced to his fourth career @entity4 victory			1
he was quick to praise his team for giving him such a dominant car under the radical new regulations deployed for the 2014 season			2
" what a car you have given me , what a car , " he said on race radio as he celebrated			0
@entity1 , whose father @entity83 won the 1982 world title , summed it up during the podium celebrations : " i took off from the start like a @entity88 and after that the car was really quick today			1
" outside the podium positions , @entity25 underlined @entity24 's early pace by finishing immediately behind his teammate @entity11 in fourth , with two - time world champion @entity92 battling for fifth for @entity93			1
@entity60 , who lost lost his right rear wheel in his earlier crash , was able to limp back to the pits for new tires and worked his way back again to claim three more points than @entity59 managed in the entire 2013 season			2
veteran @entity101 @entity58 may well have also been prominent , but was left fuming by @entity55 's early antics which left both of them in the gravel			0
@entity106 's @entity55 immediately took to @entity107 to apologize for " messing up " but @entity58 was calling for a " big penalty " over the incident			0
race officials later blamed the crash on a serious brake problem with the @entity56 and said they would be taking no further action against the driver			0
on a day when up and coming stars such as @entity10 and @entity11 were able to challenge the established @entity4 order , a new record was set by @entity118 of @entity119			1
his 10th spot for @entity121 meant at 19 year , 10 months and 18 days he became youngest driver to claim points in a grand prix , a mark previously held by @entity8			2
other points were taken by @entity128 for @entity129 in seventh , with @entity131 crossing eighth in his @entity93 and @entity133 in ninth , just ahead of teammate @entity118			0
@entity24 has the early lead in the constructors ' title after the sterling performances of @entity11 and former world champion @entity25			1
despite his early exit , @entity8 took comfort from the performance of @entity10 after @entity17 's early season testing had been blighted by difficulties			1
" although we have started on the back foot we have learned an awful lot , and when the package comes together we will be competitive , " said the 26 - year - old			0
@entity9 knows his @entity49 is capable of racing at the front of the grid , but warned that all the teams were grappling with the big changes to the cars			2
" this is a new era , this is what is happening			0
you ca n't expect us all to finish the race without a few problems , " said the @entity156 after his retirement			0
