-- @entity2 officials got their first glimmer of hope friday since they received word that that school 's beloved live oak trees had been poisoned with a massive dose of the virulent herbicide @entity10			1
a task force made up of horticulturists , agronomists and engineers had determined that the area directly adjacent to the trees does not show high concentrations of the dangerous toxin , @entity2 spokeswoman @entity11 said			1
" we were very concerned that the herbicide would spread			1
this particular one has been known to kill everything in a very large area , up to an acre , " @entity11 said			0
@entity11 said that new , clean soil mixed with activated charcoal was installed around the trees			1
the charcoal 's purpose is to try to pull away any remaining herbicide in the soil , she said			1
workers began removing the highly contaminated dirt earlier in the week , after conducting extensive tests to see just how far the poison traveled through the grounds			2
as a precaution , the workers were also removing several areas outside beds around the trees that have shown elevated levels			2
although it 's unknown how much of the poison the live oak roots took in , @entity11 said the task force was encouraged with their progress			1
" obviously we 're very concerned about the trees , given that they were given 65 times the dose than what would be necessary to kill them , " she said			1
" but they feel a bit better			0
we had thought there was virtually no chance , and now we 're just hoping			1
" @entity2 police arrested @entity60 , 62 , last week for allegedly dousing the landmark trees with herbicide so potent that agronomists said the two 130 - year - old trees on @entity66 's corner have little to no chance of survival			1
@entity60 has been charged with one count of criminal mischief and has been released on $ 50,000 bail			0
" at this time , we have no other suspects , " @entity2 police chief @entity72 said friday			2
@entity60 has cycled through three court - appointed lawyers and is currently being represented by @entity75 , a @entity76 - based attorney , according to court documents			2
attorney @entity78 said tuesday that he was retained on the matter last week but withdrew from the case , based on " some conflicts between me and mr. @entity60			0
" @entity60 's two previous court - appointed attorneys were allowed to withdraw because of their affiliations with @entity2			1
authorities first learned of the herbicide after a caller who identified himself as " @entity89 " phoned into a @entity76 , @entity91 , radio talk show , saying he had poisoned the renowned live oaks after @entity2 won a contentious november football game against the @entity94			1
" @entity89 " ended the call with " @entity96 , " a battle cry for the @entity94			0
fans typically gather around the trees after victories , draping them with toilet paper , said @entity103 , @entity2 spokesman			1
@entity103 said it 's not just @entity2 supporters who have rallied around the trees , however			1
" we 've had hundreds of calls of encouragement and suggestions from other schools in the @entity107 , including from the @entity94 , " he said , referring to the @entity107 , which includes @entity2 and the @entity94			2
friday , a @entity114 page called " @entity96 for @entity66 's " said more than $ 47,000 had been raised in support of the historic trees			2
@entity11 said that sum , combined with the amounts contributed through @entity2 and its partnerships , brings the total donation to more than $ 100,000			2
" is n't that fantastic ? " @entity11 said			0
" on the field , there 's a tremendous rivalry , but off the field , there 's a tremendous respect			0
" student body presidents of the longtime rival schools announced earlier in the week an initiative to plant sister trees on each other 's campuses , in an expression of joint unity			0
" our rivalry is more than a game			0
more times than not , it unites us instead of dividing us , " @entity138 of @entity91 said			0
the unity trees will be planted within the next months			0
the next step for the @entity66 's corner trees , @entity11 said , is to see whether the live oaks produce leaves come spring			1
" depending how long the poison was in the soil and taken up by the roots , in spite of the rain , " she said			0
" we 're just going to wait and see			0
everybody is giving it their all			0

the 130 - year - old live oaks were poisoned with a massive dose of a virulent herbicide
a task force says the toxin has n't spread far from the trees , an @entity2 spokeswoman says
the dirt around the tree has been *replaced* with clean soil and charcoal
" now we 're just hoping , " says the spokeswoman
