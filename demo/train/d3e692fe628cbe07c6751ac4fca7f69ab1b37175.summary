@entity1 spokesman @entity0 denied friday that next year 's midterm elections are the reason behind the administration 's decision to postpone the 2014 opening date for 2015 enrollment in @entity8 -- from october 15 to november 15			1
pushing back the start date , @entity0 said , will give insurers more time to get an idea of their new pool of customers before they set their 2015 rates			1
some critics , including sen. @entity17 , @entity18 , said that the move was simply a political ploy and that any changes to health care plans , such as premium increases , for example , should be public before the election			2
but @entity0 said the administration expects more people to sign up for health care insurance at the end of the current , initial open enrollment period -- which ends march 31 , 2014 -- in part because of the website problems , so starting the next enrollment window later in the year would buy insurers more time to assess the situation			1
" what was already going to be a back - loaded process is going to be more back - loaded , and that 's going to leave insurers a lot of data to sort through in a short period of time , " he said			1
the @entity42 has also extended the sign - up period from roughly seven weeks to eight			1
the new deadline is january 15 , 2015 , @entity0 said			2
the two - month window is a lot shorter than the current six - month window for 2014 coverage , he said			1
asked why the administration wo n't change the more pressing march 31 , 2014 , deadline , as even some @entity52 @entity51 have asked , @entity0 said the administration still believes the remaining four months is enough time to get people signed up for insurance			1
young adults are less likely than their older counterparts to take out a health insurance policy , but even without that issue , enrollment in @entity8 has been minute overall , particularly via the federal sign - up website @entity63			1
exact numbers are hard to pin down in the 36 states using the site			0
but as of november 2 , just 26,794 people had enrolled in the @entity63 states			0
@entity70 's current tally for this group stands at less than 45,000 enrollees , but that 's based on just a handful of states that have provided updates			0
in the 14 states running their own sign - up methods , the numbers look better but still dismal			1
at least 133,000 people had enrolled at last count			0
many more have taken advantage of the expansion of @entity84			0
sticker shock the @entity42 hopes that the added time will encourage insurers to get coverage details right and make their plans more affordable , while consumers have more time to flush the devil out of the details			1
some consumers were not only hit with high premiums during the rollout but also with deductibles above flood stage			0
people picking the bronze plan , which has the lowest premiums , will shell out about $ 5,000 before insurers foot the bills			0
even then , policyholders will cover plenty out of pocket , like doctor visits , lab tests and medications			0
" all we ever heard about @entity8 is that it would lower our deductibles and premiums , " said @entity108 , 40 of @entity109 , @entity110			2
" that 's just not what 's happened			0
" @entity108 and her husband , @entity117 , are scrambling to find affordable care for themselves and their two children			0
the exchange 's @entity122 plan was $ 1,087 a month with a $ 6,000 deductible , while a medica plan was $ 877 a month with a $ 12,700 deductible			0
both are steeper than their current plan			0
battle ahead as a side effect , the enrollment delay could also give everyone more time to contend with the political battle over @entity8 and whatever changes to the @entity8 that might result			1
republicans on @entity134 have distributed a digital playbook among their ranks to align talking points against @entity8			2
the strategy memo is titled " because of @entity8 ... i lost my insurance " and includes videos , fliers and social media posts			2
the @entity145 people are handing president @entity146 a beating over the many glitches in the rollout of the @entity8 , with his approval ratings in polls bouncing down a staircase from one low point to the next			1
@entity8 is even less popular .			2

@entity1 spokesman @entity0 denies the change is *related* to midterm elections
health *officials* want to give insurers , consumers and it pros more time to learn from *mistakes*
the delay wo n't affect 2014 coverage or sign - ups
president @entity146 's approval rating has taken a beating over the glitches in the @entity8
