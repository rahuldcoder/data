@entity0 -- the @entity3 administration is likely to come under new pressure to take more decisive steps in @entity6 following opposition claims that @entity9 's government used chemical weapons to kill more than 1,000 people			1
while the regime denied the fresh accusations , the administration said it could not immediately verify the accuracy of newly released videos online purportedly showing civilians suffering from chemical agents outside @entity19			2
still , the images were searing and prompted the @entity21 to seek an urgent @entity23 investigation , demand accountability , and not rule out additional help			2
" there is an investigation team that 's on the ground in @entity6 right now			2
and we are hopeful that the @entity9 regime will follow through on what they have claimed previously , that they are interested in a credible investigation that gets to the bottom of reports that chemical weapons have been used , " @entity30 spokesman @entity29 said			1
@entity29 added the administration has regularly considered increased aid for the rebels			2
" the conduct of this investigation , the results of this investigation or the efforts by the @entity9 regime to inhibit this investigation will certainly impact that calculation about possible additional aid , " @entity29 said			0
key questions would immediately surface if the latest troubling development from a region wracked by civil war for more than two years were to change the overall calculus for the @entity21			1
what new steps would it take ? how would it address uncertainty about the rebel makeup ? and how would it approach what some believe is a worsening multidimensional trust gap on the issue of rebel assistance ? the administration has rebuffed calls for a stronger military aid response , opting to push for a political solution and provide humanitarian , logistical and limited weaponry and other hardware			1
@entity6 activists : videos show chemical weapons used a chief problem has been identifying those rebels the @entity21 would happily deal with vs elements said to be militants , including some with ties to @entity79			1
" @entity6 today is not about choosing between two sides but rather about choosing one among many sides , " @entity81 chairman gen. @entity80 wrote this week to rep. @entity82 of @entity83			1
" it is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor			0
today , they are not , " he said in the august 19 letter			0
inherent political mistrust amid sharp partisan divisions in @entity0 coupled with close congressional vetting also have influenced the response to @entity6			2
@entity102 is currently on vacation until after @entity104			0
also critically , mistrust cuts both ways			0
according to experts who have traveled to @entity6 during the war , opposition groups have little faith in the @entity21			1
@entity6 refugees stream into @entity112 " our credibility was n't high to begin with and obviously did n't improve with time , " said @entity113 , @entity114 history professor at @entity115 and author of " @entity6 : the @entity118			2
" " they basically shrug their shoulders and say , ' oh well , what is new ? ' they feel like they are on their own on this			0
" @entity113 said the administration had not had enough contact with oppositions groups from the outset			0
" there is just a lack of knowledge of these groups , " he said			0
this is the second time the administration has faced questions about chemical weapons use in @entity6			1
last august , president @entity3 said using those weapons would cross a " red line " and provoke a @entity21 military response			1
his administration confirmed in june that chemical agents were used in april and it resulted in an uptick of military aid			2
but the " red line " tag has seriously damaged @entity21 credibility in the region , said @entity147 , author of " in the @entity148 : an eyewitness account of @entity0 's @entity150 with @entity6			1
" " reacting way too late - that has been our policy on @entity6 for some time , " @entity147 said			0
" ( the @entity21 ' credibility is ) very low because of its inability to keep to its word			0
we have done absolutely nothing to enforce the red line			0
what kind of signal does that send to the @entity6 people ? " but in his letter , @entity80 warned that even limited military action in @entity6 could lead to deeper involvement -- a point the military has made previously			1
the administration has said it has no plans to put " boots on the ground			0
" a team of @entity23 chemical weapons inspectors landed in @entity6 this week to begin probing chemical weapons allegations , and the @entity176 planned a meeting on wednesday to address the issue			1
@entity1 's @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity30 wo n't rule out more help for rebels , has n't verified latest claim on chem weapons
chairman of the @entity81 points to lack of trust as major issue in military involvement in @entity6
@entity6 opposition groups do n't trust the @entity3 administration , experts on the region say
distrust stems from the @entity21 debate over chemical weapons , likely to *reignited* after latest claims
