@entity0 -- as @entity4 head into the last throes of the campaign season , the party and the president are facing some of their lowest favorability and approval ratings , respectively , according to two new surveys			1
president @entity13 hit his lowest point in the eyes of the public according to that poll , with just 40 % of @entity18 approving of his job performance , the latest @entity12 / @entity11 poll released wednesday shows			1
an @entity22 / @entity21 poll also released wednesday handed @entity13 a similar 42 % approval rating			1
and @entity13 could be pulling down his party as just 39 % of @entity18 hold a favorable view of the @entity4 , the lowest in modern history according to the @entity12 / @entity11 poll			2
@entity13 steps ( cautiously ) back into campaign mode that 's a ten - point drop for @entity4 from the same poll in august and the decline comes in part from a dropoff among african - americans and women -- two key voter blocs @entity4 will need to turn out on nov. 4			0
the numbers come less than three weeks before @entity38 in a cycle where the president 's sagging approval numbers have been blamed for impacting @entity4 candidates , especially in crucial toss - up @entity44 races that could help @entity46 take full control of @entity48			1
@entity46 have picked up on the president 's low approval ratings in battleground states by linking @entity4 -- and even independent candidates in @entity53 and @entity54 -- to the president			1
chamber ad seeks to tie independent to @entity13 and @entity13 has mostly avoided the campaign trail this cycle , particularly @entity44 contests			0
but @entity13 will hit the road to help seven gubernatorial candidates mobilize supporters in the final weeks of campaigning			0
some @entity4 @entity44 candidates have attempted to deflect @entity46 attacks throughout the campaign by distancing themselves from @entity13 policies on key issues			1
@entity71 's @entity70 , for example , declared in an ad that she 's " not @entity13			0
" and a range of issues could be shaking @entity18 ' confidence in the president and his party : from the @entity78 threat to the public fears over the @entity81 disease that has made it onto @entity18 soil			0
republicans continued to register lower favorability marks than @entity4 with just 33 % expressing a positive view of the @entity46			2
and among independents , @entity4 also edged out the @entity46 with 33 % favorability compared to 28 % for @entity46			2
but the public does n't parse on partisan politics when it comes to rating @entity48 , slamming the legislature with an 83 % disapproval rating according to a september @entity1 / @entity95 poll .			0

@entity4 hit a *30* - year low in favorability ratings
a pair of survey released wednesday show sagging ratings for @entity4 and the president .
