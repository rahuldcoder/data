-- the five writers knew a little about each other before they decided to pile into an suv and embark upon a tour of five @entity6 states in seven days			1
but there 's probably no quicker way to get to know someone than by spending a week logging thousands of highway miles , sharing hotel rooms ( and sometimes beds ) while visiting new cities , like traveling salesmen			1
the women of the @entity16 came together in the kind of self - funded promotional stunt that seems to be the norm for independent writers on small presses , which often lack the resources to support a book tour			1
fortunately , the five bonded over a diet of whiskey , gas - station food and a shared love of writing			1
" we were all slightly dreadful at first , " author @entity30 said before a reading on the tour 's last stop in @entity35 's @entity34			1
" now , we 're like best friends			2
spending all that time together can do that			2
or it makes you hate each another , but luckily , that did n't happen to us			2
" @entity30 , 26 , was hawking her new collection of essays , " @entity45			2
" " there are days when i prefer the boys i baby - sit to the adult boys in my life			1
to be a babysitter is to be part actor , part therapist , part housekeeper , part friend , part playmate , part athlete , part mom , part dad , part chef , part chauffeur , part waiter , and part saint , which i am not			2

with fewer titles accounting for a larger share of what @entity69 read , the tours serve as reminders that independent writers and small presses are alive and well , providing alternatives to the " blockbuster " titles that get most of the publicity in mainstream media			1
initiatives such as @entity80 and @entity81 , which helped publicize the @entity16 , promote small press literature through a variety of efforts			1
efforts like setting up pop - up " guerrilla bookstores " at readings and art events remind people that great words are being written on small presses , said @entity92 with @entity93			1
the writers on this tour were already familiar with each other 's work through the " vaguely incestuous " world of online writing , said writer @entity100 , 43 , who assembled the lineup and booked the venues			1
the route from @entity104 to @entity105 was based on a book tour that @entity100 's husband did a few years ago and resulted from equal parts convenience and curiosity			1
two of the writers , @entity110 and @entity112 , already lived in the region -- @entity114 and @entity115 , respectively			1
the rest were scattered north of the @entity117 and had n't spent much time in the cities on the itinerary			2
a tour of the " dirty south " gave them a theme to work around , @entity110 said			1
each writer brought her own personality and literary sensibility to the " super trashy and weird " group aesthetic of cut - offs and matching t - shirts			1
that included a liberal attitude toward alcohol consumption before , during and after the readings			2
" we 're taking ourselves on tour , so to take ourselves too seriously would be kind of embarrassing , " said @entity100 , a co-editor of the @entity136 literary journal and keeper of the @entity139 bottle ( which actually contained @entity140 ) that was passed around before readings			1
" i did n't cook and it was @entity145 so we went to @entity146			2
it was after eight and they were already out of turkey			0
we ate macaroni & cheese and fish sticks and pudding and talked about @entity154			0
@entity155 and i had watched @entity156 the week before			0
we were watching a different @entity158 movie every week			0
all we did was watch movies , smoke cigarettes and weed			0
" -- from " @entity162 " ( @entity65 , 2012 ) by @entity100			0
writers , especially those on small presses , build hype for their books in a variety of creative ways , said @entity171 , who runs @entity172 , the poetry and fiction reading series that hosted the group 's last stop in @entity35			1
some organize their own tours while others set up readings when visiting cities on other business , she said			0
then there are contests and giveaways and oddball ploys for audience engagement			1
poet @entity189 included a temporary phone number in her book and on @entity192 and invited readers to call her			1
chapbook press safety @entity194 publicized its newest book , " @entity198 " by @entity199 , with a photo contest and poetry bomb challenge			1
the @entity16 was partly funded with a @entity201 campaign that raised $ 1,300 to help pay for some of the authors ' airfare so they could meet and kick off the tour in @entity114			1
beyond that , they ponied up their own cash for the rental car , gas , lodging , food and admission to the home of @entity69 author @entity215 in @entity216 , @entity217			1
in between driving and sleeping , they read to audiences in a puppet theater in @entity223 , bars bookstores and bars in @entity114 , @entity226 , @entity223 , @entity216 and @entity115 before their last stop in @entity35			0
while the tour 's name might imply many late - night parties , most nights they were asleep before 12 , exhausted from constant driving and performing			1
the schedule was tight due to their full - time obligations , said @entity237 , who is pursuing a phd in rhetoric and composition from @entity241 in @entity242			1
" @entity243 tickles his aloe plants			0
he shivers and farts because that s --- is poison , man , and better out than in			0
this he tells you in the voice of @entity252			0
he says you are already dead and you climb inside his ear			0
there is his silver mane , then an ocean , then a universe			0
" -- from " @entity259 " ( @entity258 , 2010 ) by @entity237			0
@entity237 acknowledged that she probably fit in least with the tour 's " trashy " theme , but relished the opprtunity to step outside academia for a bit to interface with readers			1
" i love performing and having the opportunity to speak to an audience , " @entity237 said			1
" if we 're not affecting the audience , we 're not doing our job			2
" besides , she could n't pass up a chance to spend time with other writers whose work she respected , even if the food and lodging left much to be desired			1
" we were joking that it could 've been called the @entity283 and @entity284 tour because of all the gas station food we ate , " said 35 - year - old @entity110 , a @entity279 at the @entity280			1
expectations of publicity were also low , apparently			0
@entity110 said her publisher laughed when she said @entity0 had expressed interest in attending the @entity35 reading and joked that it must have been a slow news week			0
yet , thanks to publicity from @entity172 and @entity93 , which promotes small press literature , attendees occupied all the folding chairs in the one - room gallery while the rest sat on the floor , beer cans in hand			1
" what do you feel like doing tonight ? he asks			0
this is your least favorite question the man asks			0
when he asks you this question , you feel very tired			0
you realize you do n't want to do anything except sit on his couch , drink beer , and watch tv on the big screen			0
you do n't have a big screen in your apartment			0
there is also never any alcohol in your apartment because you drink it all up , immediately			0
you want to watch @entity321 , but you ca n't say this			0
you 'll have to flip through the channels and casually stop on it and say , is that guy double - jointed ? let 's just watch this for just a second , and then a group of nasty dancers will come on or a water skiing squirrel and it would be impossible to change the channel then			1
" -- from " they could no longer @entity335 themselves : a collection of @entity338 " ( @entity339 , 2011 ) by @entity110			0
it was n't exactly the most comfortable spot in the dead of summer , crammed among 40 or so strangers , front and back doors of the gallery open because the air - conditioning was useless			2
if the sweatbox atmosphere bothered anyone , it was n't immediately apparent as they listened attentively , laughing and listening as each author read from her book			2
@entity112 , 28 , got into the spirit by sharing a bottle of white wine wrapped in a paper bag with a friend from her hometown of @entity360 , @entity105			0
a highlight of the trip for her was throwing beignets at rats on the side of the @entity367 in @entity223			0
" perfect love is crawling inside another body and finding a miniature replica of myself , stealing the replica because i fear its destruction , and painting it with a semi-gloss lacquer to ensure its longevity			0
somewhere there is a room of min - iatures formed to look like me , or almost like me			2
i worry there is a group of people searching for this room and they desire to burn it to ashes and to burn themselves to ashes and to insert those ashes into my body			0
" -- from " @entity389 " ( @entity390 , 2012 ) by @entity112			0
a guest author joined the group for most of their readings , with the @entity35 event featuring @entity396 , who had driven nearly seven hours to read for 10 minutes			0
he left shortly after the event , while guests milled about outside the gallery , smoking cigarettes , and @entity112 and @entity110 hula - hooped			2
would you be more likely to show up for a creatively themed book reading than a standard one ? share your thoughts in the comments section below .			2
