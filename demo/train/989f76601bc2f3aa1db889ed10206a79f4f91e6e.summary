-- " my beat is looking for ways to create a future which is sustainable , dynamic , prosperous and fair -- a future which is both bright and green			2
" @entity5 , eco-crusader and founder of @entity8 - based environmental web site @entity9 , wants to save the world ; and he thinks we 've got 25 years to do it			1
@entity5 , founder of @entity9 " our climate is ripping apart at the seams at a rate that 's surprising even the so - called alarmists , " he writes			1
" natural systems are collapsing			0
the ocean seems headed towards a series of catastrophic tipping points			0
economic inequity is producing a planet of billionaires and a billion desperate people			2
" @entity5 says the world 's challenge stems from the inherently unsustainable systems embedded in our culture			1
he quotes statistics that say we 're each using 2.3 hectares of land to support ourselves , instead of the 1.9 per person available			0
but , he adds , we 're not sharing the world 's resources fairly			2
" the average @entity35 uses nearly 10 hectares , the average @entity37 uses only about one and a half , while the average @entity39 has only about 6/10 of a hectare , " he says			0
@entity5 and his friends were hanging out one day , talking about how potentially world - changing solutions were n't getting media coverage			1
as @entity5 said to @entity0 , " there was plenty of space for talking about what was going wrong , but very little for talking about how to make things go better			1
" so they decided to do something about it			0
" we decided that -- as a little bit of a hobby project really -- we 'd start a blog called @entity57 and note all the various solutions we found that we thought were interesting			1
" within six months , the site was so successful that @entity5 had to give up his day job			1
three and a half years later , @entity9 is one of the most popular environmental campaigning sites on the @entity63 and has led to the publication of a successful companion book , " @entity57 : a @entity67 's guide to the @entity68			1
" the site -- and the book -- cover all aspects of sustainability , from living spaces to locally - produced food to green advocacy , and focuses on cutting - edge developments			1
@entity5 's team of writers , a mixture of journalists , scientists , architects , academics and designers , share his passion for positive thinking			1
" it 's really a kind of fun , amorphous group			0
it 's almost more of a tribe than a business in some ways , " he told @entity0			0
and they pull no punches when it comes to the future of the planet			2
@entity5 is bold enough to state the harsh truths that refusing a plastic bag , turning the tv off standby or switching to a duel - fuel car is n't enough to turn things around			1
he 's frustrated by the rise of the eco-consumer and its embracement by the media , which he describes as " muddle - headed , style - over - substance , ' lite green ' environmentalism			1
" he calls this " greenwashing			0
" " we do n't need more carpool lanes			0
we need to eliminate fossil fuels from our economy , " he writes			0
" we do n't need more recycling bins			0
we need to create a closed - loop , biomimetic , neobiological industrial system			2
we do n't need to attend a tree - planting ceremony			0
we need to become expert at ecosystem management and gardening the planet ... we need a bright green revolution			1
" this might sound extreme , but @entity5 is in touch with a large audience who share his beliefs and his vision for the future			2
he describes them as " some of the best people -- people who really care and are working really hard to try and make a difference			0
" and @entity5 's lasting message is that each one of us can -- and should -- make that difference			2
he says , " fundamentally , sustainability is a small problem writ big by six billion people			0
each of us has a part to play on that team in making this new society possible			0
" ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... what do you think of @entity5 's vision ? do you think we can avert environmental disaster ? tell us in the forum -- or read others ' thoughts on the future			1
