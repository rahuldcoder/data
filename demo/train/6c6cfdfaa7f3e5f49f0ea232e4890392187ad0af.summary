-- politicians have always been a fat target for humorists			1
" suppose you were an idiot			2
and suppose you were a member of @entity7 , " @entity5 once observed			2
" but i repeat myself			2
" and @entity8 once remarked , " i 'm not a member of any organized political party -- i am a @entity11			0
" @entity12 : the guy who makes politicians funny but humor from politicians themselves ? a much thinner volume			1
nevertheless , there have been a number of witty lines that politicians have come up with -- or , at least , for which they 've received credit			1
here 's a sampling : @entity27 : " in my many years i have come to a conclusion that one useless man is a shame , two is a law firm , and three or more is a congress			1
" @entity32 : sen. @entity33 accused the president of being " the father of every military blunder that we 've made			0
you are on the road to hell , sir , with this government , and you are not a mile off this minute			0
" " @entity33 , that is about the distance from here to the @entity45 , " @entity32 replied			0
@entity49 : " when they call the roll in the @entity48 , the senators do not know whether to answer ' present ' or ' not guilty			0
' " @entity50 , when asked how he became a war hero : " it was absolutely involuntary			1
" @entity60 : " i have left orders to be awakened at any time in case of national emergency -- even if i 'm in a @entity59 meeting			1
" @entity61 , on the @entity48 : " if you 're hanging around with nothing to do and the zoo is closed , come over to the @entity48			1
you 'll get the same kind of feeling and you wo n't have to pay			0
" @entity71 , on the @entity72 : " i do n't know whether it 's the finest public housing in @entity68 or the crown jewel of the @entity68 penal system			1
'' @entity73 , at the 2000 @entity74 : " i see [ @entity75 is here tonight , fellow @entity76 man			0
we go way back , and we have a lot in common			0
@entity71 wrote a book at @entity76			0
" @entity80 , on the 2000 election : " you know the old saying : you win some , you lose some			0
and then there 's that little - known third category			1
" @entity90 , on @entity91 : " now , i know that he 's taken some flak lately , but no one is happier , no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the @entity89			2
and that 's because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter -- like , did we fake the moon landing ? what really happened in @entity99 ? and where are @entity101 and @entity102 ? '' @entity103 highlights his mom in attacking @entity90 @entity105 expected to kick of @entity107 convention get the latest from @entity108			2
