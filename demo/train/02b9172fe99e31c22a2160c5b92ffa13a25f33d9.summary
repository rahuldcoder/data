@entity0 -- the @entity2 will report thursday the highest level of suicides among its soldiers since it began tracking the rate 28 years ago , @entity1 has learned			1
the @entity2 is expected to announce a new effort to study soldier suicides and links to post-combat stress			1
statistics obtained by @entity1 show that the @entity2 will report 128 confirmed suicides last year and an additional 15 suspected suicides in cases under investigation among active - duty soldiers and activated @entity17 and reserves			1
the confirmed rate of suicides was 20.2 per 100,000			1
@entity2 officials were reviewing the suspected suicides wednesday			1
if any of them are confirmed , the rate will rise			1
in 2007 , the @entity2 reported 115 confirmed suicides , the highest level since 1980 , when it began tracking suicides			1
the @entity2 is expected to announce a new effort to study the problem and determine why its suicide - prevention programs appear not to be working , and the extent to which post-combat stress may be a contributing factor			1
many of the suicides occur after troops return home			2
the @entity2 has long cited personal stress -- including financial , relationship and substance - abuse problems -- as the major reason for suicides , but it is also studying the extent to which deployments to a war zone may play a role			1
last month , @entity2 officials said the nation 's suicide rate was 19.5 people per 100,000 , a 2005 figure considered the most recent			1
military officials have long said it is difficult to compare the military suicide rate with that of the private sector because of demographic differences and overall human stress factors			2
another factor is that military suicides tend to be young men with access to weapons			2
suicides for @entity65 were also up in 2008			1
@entity65 had 41 suicides in 2008 , up from 33 in 2007 and 25 in 2006 , according to a @entity65 report the numbers did not surprise @entity69 , whose 23 - year - old son , @entity70 -- a @entity65 -- hanged himself on june 22 , 2004 -- 11 months after returning from @entity71			1
the night before , " @entity70 asked if he could sit in my lap and if we could rock , " @entity70 said			0
" it was about 11:30 at night			0
and i rocked him for about 45 minutes			0
now here you have a 23 - year - old , 150 - pound @entity65 that i 'm just rocking and his therapist said it was his last gasp			2
it was his last place for refuge , and then the next time i held him in my lap was when i was taking him down from the rafters			0
he had put the hose around his neck double - looped and he was dead			0
" he said his son had not been able to get the treatment he needed from the @entity87			0

the government settled with the family for $ 350,000			0
" the foolish part of all this is we just wanted someone to say they did wrong , " he said			0
" but no one would until recently			0
" @entity70 said the @entity104 attorney , acting on behalf of the @entity87 , told him his son 's case had led the @entity87 mental system to be changed			2
fear of stigma also may have played a role in making his son reluctant to seek professional help			0
his son , @entity70 said , was afraid that getting mental help would affect his chances of getting a job as a state trooper			0
" a year after he died , they accepted him , " the father said			2
