-- @entity2 's image of @entity3 combines swagger , style and an unwillingness to get pushed around			1
@entity7 once warned a @entity9 commander in " @entity10 " that " there are certain sections of @entity3 , @entity13 , that i would n't advise you to try to invade			2
" seventy years ago , movie audiences would have laughed in appreciation of the city 's toughness			2
today , however , @entity10 would hardly recognize the place			0
mayor @entity20 hit the panic button over soft drinks this week , proposing a citywide ban on any serving of sugary - sweet soda more than 16 ounces in restaurants , movie theaters and street carts			1
@entity29 claims that he needs to have the cops throw themselves between consumers and liquid refreshment to save citizens from themselves and prevent obesity			0
overheard on @entity0 : doughnut lovers ' lament , washed down with a giant soda this is just the latest intervention staged by @entity41			0
his past decrees banned smoking , not just indoors in places of business , but also outside of businesses and in parks			0
@entity20 also banned restaurants from cooking with artificial trans fats			2
in those cases , he took a lot of criticism as being a health hysteric and a food nanny , but at least an argument existed that consumer choice might have been irrelevant			0
restaurants do n't usually advertise all of their ingredients on the menu , for instance , and few people get asked permission before someone lights a cigarette in the doorway of an establishment			0
soft drinks : @entity69 in obesity fight ? in this case , though , no such argument exists			0
people purchase the volume of beverage they desire , and in almost every case , plenty of choice exists for smaller quantities			0
the outcome of barring the sale of anything larger than 16 ounces of @entity83 or @entity84 at the ballpark will be that more containers will get thrown out as people just buy more units , and that waste will have to be disposed of later			0
consumers will pay more and have more inconvenience in purchasing what they want to drink , and will still end up drinking the same amount anyway			0
is drinking soda really that bad for you ? the new restrictions make little sense for most other venues			1
fast - food restaurants have customer - accessible fountains in most cases for in - store dining			0
few people buy the large size , and many of these restaurants no longer bother with size at all for those sales , sticking with one standard size			2
will @entity29 start regulating how many refills each customer gets , too ? for that matter , many traditional restaurants offer free refills on soft drinks , too			0
if @entity29 caps those , what happens when customers just buy another soft - drink order ? will the restaurant be forced to stop serving root beer far more quickly than they stop serving beer ? a soda per day may raise heart - attack risk nor do the drink categories make sense , either			1
@entity20 's order wo n't apply to alcoholic beverages , even though many of those are loaded with calories , especially beers and ales , or to dairy - based drinks			1
as @entity139 's @entity138 points out , that means that while @entity3 will no longer be able to ingest 240 calories drinking a 20 - ounce @entity83 , they will still have no trouble buying a 24 - ounce , 520 - calorie double - chocolatey frappucino at @entity144 , or a 20 - ounce , 800 - calorie milkshake			1
now , some of those choices may be better than others , although it 's hard to argue that the dietary value of milk justifies ingesting an 800 - calorie drink as opposed to the 240 - calorie cola			1
but more to the point , that 's a decision that free people should be able to make on their own			2
@entity3 should n't have to ask @entity29 , " mayor , may i ? " when selecting an otherwise - legal and nonlethal beverage			1
@entity160 : how i kicked my @entity83 habit @entity20 justifies his nanny - state interventions by pointing to the social costs of obesity , but there is no direct causal link between obesity and 20 - ounce sodas with sugar in them , and neither would it be anyone 's business at all except for the increasing government control and subsidies for health care			1
@entity20 's insistence on dictating consumer choices has a more direct connection to an assumption that government should control our access to health care than obesity has to a couple of @entity184			1
perhaps it 's time for @entity3 to put their mayor on a power diet , and to wise up about the real trade - offs between expanding safety - net programs and personal choice			1
soft drinks wo n't be the last of the usual suspects that mayor may i will round up in his crusade to dictate his choices and eliminate everyone else 's			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			2

@entity201 : @entity3 mayor 's proposal to ban soda size servings is *wrong*
he says it makes no sense : what 's to stop people from drinking too much soda ?
he calls mayor @entity20 's proposal a nanny - state rule
@entity201 : new rule would dictate mayor 's choices and eliminate everyone else 's
