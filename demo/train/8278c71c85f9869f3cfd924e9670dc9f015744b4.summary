-- there are a lot of things in my freezer			2
animal sperm is n't one of them			1
though , to be fair , i 've never actually checked the full ingredients of a @entity10			2
and now i have concerns			2
there 's a polar bear on the packaging			1
i admit that it 's an irrational new fear , but it all stems from several popular online reports this week about @entity19 scientists at @entity20 creating a very specific sperm bank for endangered species using new innovations in freeze - drying			1
but , while my freezer probably does n't contain any animal sperm , soon we might be seeing science freezers that do			1
science freezers , of course , being the technical description for freezers that hold ... science			2
" @entity33 , reach in there and grab me a vial of science			2
" working with the city 's zoo , @entity19 researchers at @entity20 have now successfully freeze - dried sperm from chimps , a slow loris , and a giraffe			1
and when it comes time to bring the little swimmers back to life , they simply have to let them thaw out in water			2
like you would a frozen chicken cutlet			2
but , in this case , a chunk of sperm			1
i say ' chunk ' because i assume they come in bricks , and if you had enough of them you could build a decent backyard @entity58 in the winter			0
you have your uses for frozen sperm			1
chunks or not , the way this technology actually works is that it uses a specially developed preservative which allows the frozen future animal to be stored at a relatively high temperature that 's actually just above freezing			1
really , then , this new way of doing things does n't even require a freezer at all			0
you can literally put it next to your leftovers in the fridge			0
though , drunkenly grabbing the wrong @entity79 in the middle of the night could prove disastrous			0
" leftover fettuccini alfredo ? do n't mind if i do ! " the current alternative is liquid nitrogen			0
but that requires lots of equipment and significantly more energy			0
thus , lead professor , @entity88 , has been working on this new method for over a decade , developing a way to incorporate the special buffer preservative within the freeze - drying process , all while maintaining both the sperm and its genetic information for decades at a time			1
you know , to create a vintage market			0
( @entity98 : 2013 was a good year for walrus			0
) and now that @entity88 and his fellow scientists seem to have this system down , they 're gearing up an endangered species sperm bank so that we can more efficiently confuse and aggravate an already pissed - off planet			1
" look , y'all , i 'm tired of giant pandas			0
get these weirdos off of me ! " " shut up , @entity107			1
they make good web videos			0
" but never mind this tragic little home in the solar system , the @entity20 scientists are even thinking about colonizing other planets with some of our rarest species			1
because , you know , what @entity116 really needs is a lemur			0
professor @entity88 has only experimented with animals , and admits that he 's unaware of any human application for this technology			1
but that 's probably a good thing			1
because when we do finally decide to create a whole new ecosystem in space , it 's probably far better off with turtles and sloths			2
humans would just stand around twerking giant space rocks and instagramming it back to everyone waiting on the mothership			0
because then -- and only then -- will we know the @entity116 is officially ours			0
at least i 'm pretty sure that 's how we 'll claim everything in the future			2
i see you like the silver @entity143			0
" now , as @entity88 's endangered animal sperm bank moves forward , he 's keen to get his hands on a bunch of larger animals that are at risk			1
like elephants and tigers and rhinos			0
the zoo has 132 different species for him to choose from , so that 's a lot of de-sperminizing			1
and it 's only half the battle -- the next step in the process is figuring out a way to use this new technology to freeze - dry the female 's eggs as well			1
so , who knows when we 'll eventually get to beam our weirdest little creatures into the cosmos			0
but when we do , i assure you it will be delightfully unnecessary			0
