one thing appeared certain when @entity1 announced thursday how much money its @entity4 e-readers brought in over the past three months : the news would be lousy			1
revenue from the company 's @entity8 for its fiscal 2013 third quarter declined 26 % from the same period a year ago , primarily as a result of slumping sales of the devices			0
is the bookseller just losing ground to rival @entity16 and its market - leading line of @entity18 ? perhaps			1
but many tech analysts see something else happening : the booming market for tablet computers is starting to make the dedicated e-reader obsolete			1
" it 's not that the @entity4 failed , " said @entity24 , a digital analyst at @entity26			0
" it 's that the world of tablets exploded , going faster than anyone expected , putting us in a place where tablets are now a fundamental part of our computing and lifestyle entourage , not just a handy device to consume a bit of media			2
" @entity41 rocked the computing world in 2010 with the release of the @entity44 , introducing the world to the concept of user - friendly tablets			0
while they already existed in some form , tablets were pretty much unknown to all but the most tech - savvy among us			0
since then , all @entity41 has done is sell more than 120 million of them			0
competitors struggled to come up with a worthy alternative until late the next year , when @entity16 -- already a leader in the e-reader market -- rolled out its simpler , smaller @entity56 , priced at $ 199 , far lower than the @entity44			1
its relative success not only inspired the launch of devices such as the @entity61 7 , but it likely nudged @entity41 into the new midsize tablet market with the @entity63			0
the net effect ? anyone interested in a tablet now probably has a price point with which they 'll be comfortable			0
and tablets , which are priced similarly to top e-readers , also work well for reading e-books			1
throw in @entity72 , apps and e-mail -- all on a full - color tablet screen -- and e-readers suffer by comparison			2
this trend has been particularly unkind to the @entity4			0
during the quarter that included last year 's holiday season , @entity1 's nook business , which includes e-readers and e-books , suffered a 12.6 % sales decline over 2011 , bringing in just $ 311 million			1
earlier this month , the company said the nook - related losses they 'll announce thursday would be even bigger than previously expected			1
the bad news came despite @entity1 slashing the price of its @entity91 e-reader in december to $ 79			1
@entity16 does n't release detailed sales figures			1
but the @entity56 clearly emerged as the market leader in the past couple of years , after doing neck - and - neck battle with the @entity4 early on			2
in the last quarter of 2012 , the company said it increased its sale of e-books and other content for kindles and similar devices by 22 % over the same quarter in 2011			0
but analysts expect that even @entity16 's success with dedicated e-readers will fade			1
" it 's a rough market to compete , " said @entity105 , a tech - industry analyst with research firm @entity107 " on one hand , devices like the @entity44 dominate the consumer tablet experience which includes reading			2
on the other hand , less demand for dedicated devices had helped @entity16 , which already established a strong brand presence with @entity56 as part of a much larger personal - cloud ecosystem			1
" @entity16 has transitioned well into that new world			2
this holiday season , the new @entity119 was @entity16 's top - selling device in the @entity56 line , the company announced			1
second ? the older , and price - reduced , @entity56			2
hands - on with the new @entity18 and unlike @entity1 , which is strongly branded as a bookstore , @entity16 has created its own online universe of sales , @entity24 said			1
" as part of @entity1 , the @entity4 is stuck as a media device offered to media consumers when in reality the tablet business is poised for much more than this , " he said			2
many reviewers actually liked @entity1 's response , the @entity132 , better than the first - generation @entity56			1
but , as @entity24 notes , its lack of an expansive ecosystem hurt it			0
when the first wave of tablets hit the market , three years after the first kindle and a year after the @entity4 , e-readers could still boast a significantly better reading experience			1
e-ink felt significantly more like printed text than a sometimes glare - prone tablet screen , which was difficult to read in bright sunlight			0
but now , every one of the major tablet makers boasts high - definition screens that ratchet up not just the quality of video and snazzy graphics but the way text appears in reading apps			2
the general consensus among observers is that they have n't caught up to the dedicated e-readers in text quality quite yet , but give them time			1
" if you love reading and are looking to invest a chunk of money into a device as a dedicated e-reader , then the @entity44 is not your best bet , " @entity158 , of @entity161 content partner @entity159 , wrote last year in a review comparing the third - generation ipad to e-readers such as the third - generation kindle			1
( that @entity44 has the same screen as the most recent one )			0
" the value you can get from devices like the @entity56 ( or several other competitors like the @entity177 or @entity178 ) , will allow you to save money to spend on what is presumably your main passion : books			2
" but for folks wanting a more complete computing experience , he wrote , the difference was already negligible			0
" the trouble comes when you start to think of your e-reader as more than an e-reader , " he wrote			0
" e-ink kindles are abysmal at web browsing , for example , and they do n't run popular apps and games like the @entity44 and other tablets on the market today			0
" there are other types of reading , like webpages and magazines , that matter just as much as books to many readers , too			0
for those needs , an @entity44 's retina display will display images and text like a champ			0
" so , is there any future for dedicated e-readers ? @entity24 says that as @entity16 continues to establish itself as an internet clearinghouse for all sorts of goods ( both physical and digital ) , the @entity4 , which got a $ 300 million infusion from @entity211 last year , could look to selling textbooks and other educational tools			1
a rumored plan to split the e-book division off from @entity1 's brick - and - mortar stores could come as early as thursday and would be a perfect jumping - off point , he said			2
" all the more reason for @entity4 to separate from @entity1 , turning to its investment partners like @entity211 and @entity223 and saying , ' let 's see how far we can take this platform into productivity and education , ' " he said			0
" of course there 's risk there , but there was risk in getting into the tablet business			0

as tablet sales *skyrocket* , dedicated e-readers have suffered
@entity1 is expected to announce dismal sales for its nook e-reader line
@entity16 leads the field , but has also done well with its @entity56 tablets , online store
observers say reading experience on tablets has improved
