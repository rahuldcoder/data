-- immigration is the only issue where a political candidate can totally do the bidding of the @entity6 lobbyists and still be hailed as compassionate and humane			2
at @entity0 's @entity10 national security debate this past tuesday , former speaker of the house @entity7 reconfirmed his longstanding immigration policy : -- a commitment to enhanced border security -- a guest worker program -- individual hearings for each of 12 million or so illegal aliens , at which those with long ties to the country will gain residency rights -- no citizenship for illegal entries on its face , this program is unworkable			1
examine each piece in turn : why the border ? the border is the wrong place to stop illegal immigration , if only because tighter security would n't stop the up to 45 % of the illegal population who enter the country legally , then overstay their visas , as estimated by the @entity37 on @entity38			1
the right place to stop illegality is the workplace			0
if employers faced an effective requirement to hire only legal workers , and meaningful penalties for breaking the law , we 'd change the incentive structure that creates the problem in the first place			1
as is , employers are punished only if they can be shown to have employed illegal labor " knowingly , " meaning that so long as the employee produces a valid - seeming @entity56 number , the employer goes scot - free			1
even if somehow caught , the fines are small			0
under those circumstances , you could deploy the whole @entity60 on the @entity62 border and hardly make an impact on the problem			1
immigration enforcement inescapably impinges on employers , especially employers in low - wage industries such as restaurants , hotels , groundskeeping and meatpacking , whose voices are heard through those @entity6 lobbyists			1
border security is the policy you endorse if you do n't want to impinge on employers			1
which means that border security is the policy you endorse if you do n't want your immigration enforcement to succeed			1
why guest workers ? the @entity82 in 2011 does not exactly suffer from a labor shortage			1
the unemployment rates for the most recent immigrants are particularly bad : the @entity87 unemployment rate is almost 12 % , the unemployment rate for people without a high school diploma is almost 14 %			1
how can you imagine that the @entity82 needs an even larger population of low - skilled labor ? when most @entity82 hear the phrase " guest worker , " they think " agricultural labor			1
" but past guest worker proposals have not been so limited			0
such proposals generally provide that when employers can not attract labor of a specific type at a specific wage , they may import that labor from abroad , and not only from @entity62 ( a middle - income country by world standards ) , but from genuinely poor countries such as @entity107 , @entity108 or @entity109			2
the only requirement is that guest workers be paid above the @entity82 minimum wage			1
employers in difficult or dangerous industries such as nursing homes or garbage recycling can find @entity82 today who will do very hard work at very low wages			1
but such employees will not necessarily be grateful for the opportunity , and they will know that they can quit the job without forfeiting their right to remain in the country			0
guest working is the policy you endorse if your labor market priority is a cheaper and more pliable work force			0
why hearings ? @entity131 had a good applause line about uprooting the illegal alien who has sunk 25 - year roots in the country and has citizen children and grandchildren			1
but how do you tell the difference between that person and between the illegal alien who has been present for 20 years ? or two years ? or two months ? @entity131 proposes individualized hearings by citizen courts			1
but 12 million hearings ? really ? even if we could somehow complete a hearing an hour , you are talking about 1.5 million person - days , or 5,769 person - years			1
and that 's assuming the courts approved the concept , which they very well might not			2
the idea is unworkable on its face			2
it would rapidly disintegrate into something very like blanket approvals of whole categories of illegals -- in other words , into some kind of qualified amnesty			0
hearings are the policy you endorse if your real goal is to find a way to represent amnesty as something other than amnesty			2
why not citizenship ? @entity131 proposes to confer on much of the 12 million illegal population the right to live and work in the @entity82 , but not citizenship			1
that is , not the right to vote			0
at a stroke , the measure would create a huge class of subordinated workers in this country			2
but it would also do something else , something very politically ingenious			0
the newly legalized residents of the @entity82 would no longer have reason to hide from the @entity184			1
they 'd be enumerated just in time for 2020			0
immigration magnet states such as @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 would gain increased representation in @entity190 and greater clout in the @entity192			2
but because those new residents would not be able to vote , the clout would be exercised only by the state 's older citizen population , and it would be that way for years to come			0
( of the top 10 illegal immigration states , only four are blue states : @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204			2
) were illegal aliens to gain the franchise , they 'd likely vote overwhelmingly @entity207			0
even in the @entity10 year 2004 , the @entity207 swept voters with incomes of less than $ 15,000 by a 63 % to 36 % margin , and voters with family incomes of $ 15,000 - $ 30,000 by a 57 % to 42 % margin			0
as noncitizens , the former illegals would not vote at all			0
@entity216 is the policy you advocate if you want to expand the low - wage work force while tamping down the number of low - wage @entity207 voters			0
is there a better way ? there is , and it 's the way advocated by @entity10 presidential candidate @entity226			0
1 : enforce the immigration laws at the workplace , removing the magnet that draws new illegal workers and encouraging the existing illegal population to return home			1
yes , that population includes people who have been present in the country for more than 20 years and wo n't return			0
it also includes people who have been in the country less than 20 months and might well return if they can not find work in the @entity82 2 : pause to assess			2
see how much an enforcement - first policy reduces the illegal population			0
the best estimates suggest that the recession of 2008 - 2009 sent perhaps 1.7 million illegals back home			0
a prolonged period of enforcement -- and the removal of the offer of early amnesty -- would likely reduce the illegal population even more			0
3 : debate and decide on any future amnesty proposal after enforcement has taken effect , not before			0
if any approach to immigration deserves to be described as " humane , " it is the approach that begins with concern for the stagnating wages of @entity82 workers			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity263 .			2

@entity263 : @entity7 's plan does n't solve immigration problem
by *emphasizing* border security , it *neglects* role of employers as magnet , he says
holding individual hearings on 12 million illegal immigrants is unworkable , @entity263 says
@entity278 : @entity131 plan would hurt @entity82 workers whose wages are stagnating
