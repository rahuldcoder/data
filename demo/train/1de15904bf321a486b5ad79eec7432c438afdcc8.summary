@entity0 , @entity1 -- when five students at @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity1 , taunted @entity8 students by wearing t - shirts bearing the @entity11 flag on @entity12 , even though administrators had told students beforehand not to wear flag clothing that day , they caused a ruckus , divided a community and reignited the culture wars			1
and , it turns out , they were just getting warmed up			0
the ruckus ensued when assistant principal @entity21 -- apparently fearing that the boys ' fashion choices might provoke a violent response from @entity8 students who have developed an emotional attachment to the faux holiday as " their day " -- told the youths to either turn their t - shirts inside out or go home			1
the lads chose the latter , and were , for this act of defiance , magically transformed from bratty kids to defenders of individual freedom and innocent victims of the establishment			2
why not ? everyone else in society plays the victim			0
nothing is ever anyone 's fault			0
someone else is always to blame			0
and so why should n't these five young men get a chance to portray themselves as an oppressed minority ? this part is even more bizarre : conservatives are defending the rights of the students because the story fits into their paranoid narrative of cultural displacement -- where the @entity60 flag is supplanting @entity61 , @entity52 is drowning out @entity62 , the tortilla has bread on the run , and so on and on			1
this is outrageous , conservatives say , as they blast school administrators by accusing them of overstepping their bounds			1
conservatives take this stance , but have spent the better part of the last three decades asserting -- in legal briefs and oral arguments before the @entity11 @entity73 -- the power of public school administrators to maintain order and prevent disruptive behavior even at the expense of curtailing students ' first amendment rights			1
in a classic and clumsy flip - flop , conservatives were against first amendment rights for public school students on campus before they were in favor of them			1
you see , conservatives usually do n't give a hoot about whether students have the right to express , on school campuses , their opinion about this or that -- especially if doing so threatens to upset the social order			1
now , suddenly , because of the @entity6 case , they 've found religion and they 're ready to side with the @entity97 in defense of free speech rights for students ? talk about strange bedfellows			1
i got a chance to see this hypocrisy up close last week when i appeared on @entity2 to discuss the @entity6 story with @entity106 , conservative legal analyst and law professor			0
@entity106 defended the right of the five students to defy school administrators in exercise of their first amendment rights to free expression			1
he cited case law that is almost as old as i am -- tinker v @entity115 ( 1969 )			0
in that case , which involved high school and junior high school students who wore black armbands to protest the @entity122 and were suspended as a result , the @entity73 ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and declared that students do n't " shed their constitutional rights to free speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate			1
" but since @entity133 , the justices have curtailed first amendment rights of students , especially when the expression of those rights is disruptive , in three other cases : @entity139 ( 1986 ) , where the @entity73 held that a high school student 's speech during an assembly -- filled as it was with sexual innuendo -- was not protected ; @entity144 ( 1988 ) , where the court held that schools can regulate the content of student newpapers ; and @entity149 ( 2007 ) , where the court held that officials can restrict student speech at a school - supervised event even if it takes place off - campus			1
interestingly , in the @entity158 case , the school administrators were represented by no less prominent a conservative than @entity160 , the former @entity161			2
the truth is that school administrators have a greater ability to restrict the speech of their students than the government does to restrict the speech of the general public			1
that 's what the @entity73 has said repeatedly in the last three decades , and that 's the way it is			0
some of this should sound familiar to conservatives			2
this has been their argument for years			0
no matter how they feel about what happened at @entity5 on @entity12 , the least they can do is claim it			0
they should be proud to do so			0
school administrators need the power to keep order and enforce codes of decency			2
just look at what just happened in another , much more offensive case of racial harassment , this one after a high school soccer game in @entity189 , @entity190			2
@entity195 and @entity196 were matched up , and @entity197 won the game 4 - 2 in overtime to claim the boys state championship			2
but now several @entity197 students admit they made and distributed dozens of " green cards , " which fans threw onto the field after the game like confetti			0
why green cards ? because @entity209 's soccer team is mostly latino			0
get it ? the students behind this ugly act have been suspended			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216			2

@entity216 : students wore @entity11 flag t - shirts after school said no flag shirts
@entity216 : was a taunt to @entity225 ; principal asked them to turn shirts inside - out or go home
conservatives *hypocritical* , he writes , by *touting* students as *martyrs* for freedom
he writes : they always say right of schools to maintain order trumps students ' speech rights
