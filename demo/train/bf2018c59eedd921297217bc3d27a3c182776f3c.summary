with domestic labor costs rising , many @entity1 manufacturing producers are now looking to relocate their factories in other regions of the world			1
could @entity6 replace @entity1 and / or @entity7 as the world 's next manufacturing hub ? to be sure , @entity6 has a number of manufacturing advantages that it has yet to realize			1
besides low labor costs and abundant resources , these include duty - free and quota - free access to @entity17 and @entity18 markets for light manufactures under the @entity20 and the @entity21			1
is this enough to offset @entity6 's generally low labor productivity relative to that of its @entity1 competitors ? yes , if @entity6 can implement appropriate supportive policies to leverage its opportunities soon			1
this is the finding from a recent book by a team of @entity31 economists			0
@entity7 dominates the global export market in light manufacturing , and its competitive edge far exceeds that of low income exporters that recently entered the global market			2
but steeply rising costs of land , regulatory compliance , and especially labor in @entity7 's coastal export manufacturing centers have begun to erode the latter 's cost advantage , a trend likely to accelerate in the coming years			1
the ongoing redistribution of cost advantages in labor - intensive manufacturing presents an opportunity for @entity6 to start producing many light manufactures , enhance private investment and create millions of jobs			1
read more : @entity53 competes with @entity7 , @entity54 to invest in @entity6 according to new evidence , feasible , low - cost , sharply focused policy initiatives aimed at enhancing private investment could launch the region on a path to becoming competitive in light manufacturing			1
these initiatives would complement progress on broader investment reforms and could foster industrialization and raise the market share of domestically produced goods in rapidly growing local markets for light manufacturers			0
and as local producers scale up , product will improve , and experience with technology , management and marketing will accumulate , allowing them to seize emerging export opportunities			0
in @entity6 , as in @entity7 and @entity77 , policies that encourage foreign direct investment can speed up industrial development and export expansion			2
isolated successes can be multiplied , as with @entity84 's recent foray into selling cut flowers in @entity18 markets : a single pioneering firm opened the door to an industry that now employs 50,000 workers			0
previous studies identified long lists of constraints , including corruption , red tape , inadequate utilities , poor transport and skills , inadequate access to finance , and so on			0
in contrast , the book proposes smaller , more specific , and sometimes newly identified constraints			0
narrowing the analysis can make the reform agenda more manageable within the financial and human resource constraints of most @entity108 countries			1
take the leather industry in @entity84			0
this sector employs about 8,000 workers and exported about $ 8 million in 2010 , a fraction of similar countries in @entity1 such as @entity77			0
@entity84 's labor costs are lower than @entity1 's and the country has @entity6 's second largest cattle population , next to @entity117			1

yet the most binding constraint is the shortage of quality processed leather due to poor disease control , lack of quality processing of raw hides and restrictive trade policies on processed leather			0
once the problems are identified , the proposed solutions are straightforward			0
treat ectoparasites ( the skin disease that causes blemishes ) at modest cost ; allow imports and exports of raw hides and processed leather to help alleviate this constraint ; and provide technical assistance			0
some of these measures require changing existing policies			0
others require provision of public goods such as industrial parks that could be inexpensive			0
@entity84 's comparative advantage in wages , productivity , and natural resources has led the @entity154 , a @entity7 shoe maker , to build a factory in @entity84 in three months , with two production lines starting in january 2012 , exporting 20,000 pairs of shoes a month and creating some 550 jobs			1
so the opportunities and the preconditions are certainly there , provided @entity108 policy makers speedily seize them , as the book notes			0
but will @entity6 be the world 's next manufacturing hub ? not likely			2
@entity167 can be an unprecedented opportunity for @entity6 to industrialize and provide productive jobs to millions of @entity108 , especially young people who make up as much as 36 % of the total working - age population ; three in five of @entity6 's unemployed are under the age of 25			1
read more : is the @entity173 losing out to @entity7 in @entity6 ? but the emergence of @entity7 as a powerhouse producing a variety of manufacturing goods at very cheap prices thanks to the large scale and skilful exploitation of the supply chain means that not all manufacturing jobs will be transferred from @entity7 to @entity6			1
due to widely varying country conditions , some @entity108 economies can take advantage of favorable wages and natural resources and benefit from taking timely measures to develop and export manufacturing goods			1
but large - scale production requirements also mean that some jobs will be transferred to countries such as @entity54 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity77 while others will move to @entity7 's interior			2
in short , the invisible hand of globalization will work to ensure a redistribution of cost advantages to the benefit of the ultimate consumers around the world .			2

low labor costs and abundant resources are some of @entity6 's manufacturing advantages
rising costs of land and labor in @entity7 have begun to erode @entity214 's cost advantage
@entity108 countries can benefit from taking timely measures to develop manufacturing goods
@entity167 can help @entity6 industrialize and create jobs for millions
