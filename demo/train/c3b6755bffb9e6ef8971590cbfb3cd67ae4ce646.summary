-- she graced the cover of @entity3 , launched a best - selling biography and was named @entity5			0
quite impressive , considering this was her " time off work			0
" even more so , given she 's a race horse			2
champion thoroughbred @entity8 has n't competed since her dramatic win at @entity13 's @entity12 eight months ago but that has n't diminished the hype surrounding the world 's greatest sprinter , who remains undefeated in a staggering 22 consecutive races			1
now , after a long absence due to muscle injury , the six - year - old mare is set to return to the track in what could well prove her d - day race			1
" we 're all hoping she wins on saturday , " co-owner @entity26 told @entity0			0
" but the real benefit is she does n't read the newspapers so she does n't know the pressure is on			0
" her performance at the @entity36 , in her hometown of @entity34 , will determine if this is the last hurrah of a stellar career			2
" if things go really well , we 've got around two or three more races left in her , " @entity26 said			0
and if she does n't live up to expectations ? " we 'll just have to see			0
the fact she got 22 wins without losing , and the affection @entity47 have for her , means our respect for her is so high			2
none of us want to see her race if she ca n't present herself well			0
" it will be a defining race for a horse who appeared " tired and cranky " in her most recent win at the @entity58 in june			2
@entity8 , worth almost $ 7 million in prize money , barely nudged ahead of the tightly fought pack			2
it was later revealed she had muscle strain in her legs which would put her out of action -- until now			0
" she was courageous the way she won at @entity12 , " @entity26 said			2
" it was at the end of a very long run of competitions -- she 'd had five races that year and a trip to the @entity13			0
" healed and rested after an eight - month break , @entity26 says we 'll see a return to the @entity8 of old on saturday -- not the mare who scrambled over the finishing line in front of a sellout crowd of 80,000 at @entity12			1
" she 's fully recovered			0
she 's got a glint in her eye and her mind and body are strong , " he added			0
she appeared back on top form during a training run in @entity34 last week , with bookmakers already placing the two - time @entity36 winner as the favorite for saturday 's race			1
depending on her performance , @entity8 could next compete at a handful of races across @entity47 in the coming months , including @entity96 in @entity34 and the @entity97 in @entity98 , said @entity26			1
but a return to @entity12 was unlikely , he added			0
since demolishing the field in her first major win at the @entity105 in 2009 , an air of mystique has followed world champion thoroughbred			1
the superstar mare , who even has her own @entity110 handle , has not just won all 22 of her races -- with the exception of @entity12 she has won them by staggering margins , destroying world - class fields to become one of the top - rated race horses on the planet			1
her unblemished record is the second highest of all time , trailing behind only @entity125 horse @entity123 , which apparently took 54 races in the late 1800s			1
beyond the track , @entity8 may also have a profitable career as a breeding mare , with managing owner @entity131 last year hinting that champion @entity13 thoroughbred @entity133 could be a good match			1
@entity133 , who wrapped up his stellar career in the @entity136 at @entity12 with an unblemished 14 - win record , has now been put out to stud -- with big returns expected for owner @entity141 prince @entity140			1
the top - rated race horse in the world is expected to start his new duties this month , commanding a fee of $ 160,000 each time he sires a foal			0
win or lose on saturday , one thing is certain -- @entity8 has already cemented her place in the hearts of @entity47			1
more than 10,000 people packed into @entity34 's @entity154 to watch her @entity12 triumph on the big screen in june , her biography has sold 50,000 copies , and in december she became the first horse to grace the country 's @entity3 .			1

horse racing 's greatest sprinter , @entity8 , returns to track after long absence
after *nailbiting* @entity12 win , @entity47 mare competes for first time in eight months
depending on *outcome* at @entity36 , it could be one of her last races
champion thoroughbred could have profitable future as breeding mare
