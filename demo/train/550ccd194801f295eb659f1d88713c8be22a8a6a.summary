-- over the past few weeks , new attention has been paid to longstanding allegations that @entity3 sexually assaulted multiple women over the course of his career			1
as new information and accusers are brought to light , we are reminded of an unshakable feature of @entity13 life : rape culture			1
by " rape culture , " i refer to the ways that our society and its institutions normalize , promote , excuse , and enable sexual violence against men and women			1
while i can not definitively say that @entity3 is guilty of the crimes of which he is accused , the conversation about him epitomizes some of the most pernicious aspects of rape culture			1
patriarchy for decades , reports of @entity3 's alleged sexual misconduct have circulated in private circles and , more recently , mainstream media outlets			1
despite report after report , often from credible sources , the general public has failed to take the stories seriously			0
that was , of course , until male comedian @entity40 raised the rape allegations during a two - minute comedy skit last month			1
this is not a coincidence , but rather a key feature of rape culture , which diminishes the legitimacy of women 's voices and truth claims			1
by privileging the perspectives of men , who have a material investment in the maintenance of gender injustice , we allow rape culture to survive and thrive			1
in this case , it is entirely reasonable to assume that if @entity40 ( or another man ) had n't made the claims publicly , we would still be talking about @entity3 as @entity13 's favorite father rather than a possible sociopath			2
denial in the face of horrific evidence against @entity3 , most @entity13 simply elected to look the other way			2
from fans to industry executives to his latest biographer , we all committed to denying the existence of consistent rape allegations throughout @entity3 's career			2
of course , part of this is about the unique position that @entity3 holds in the public imagination			2
after all , who wants to believe that @entity13 's most beloved father and black @entity13 's socio - moral steward could be a depraved serial rapist ? but it 's deeper than that			0
we live in a society where even the most ordinary and anonymous of accused rapists is offered the benefit of social and legal doubt			0
this is why we 're quick to chalk up rapes , particularly acquaintance rapes , as " misunderstandings " or " miscommunications " rather than the crimes that they are			0
blaming the victim rather than offering criticism of @entity3 's alleged actions , many have chosen to focus on the behavior of the accusers			2
why were they alone with him in the first place ? what were they wearing ? how can they cry rape if they had consensual sex with him in the past ? why did n't they do more to physically fight him off ? this sensibility can be seen in my colleague @entity115 's interview with @entity118 , when he asked her why she did n't use her teeth to defend herself from @entity3 's alleged sexual assault			1
@entity115 responded to discussion of the interview wednesday with an apology , saying " as i am a victim myself i would never want to suggest that any victim could have prevented a rape			0
" still , when such questions are raised , even by victims of sexual assault , we reinforce one of the dominant narratives of rape culture : " if you get raped , it 's at least partially your own fault			1
" perpetuating myths some people have pointed to @entity3 's public persona , philanthropy , and other positive attributes to refute the rape allegations			1
others have pointed to the personal nature of his relationships with his accusers as proof that he is not a rapist			0
such gestures are commonly used to reinforce the myth that rapists are strangers , social outcasts or part of a seedy criminal class			0
the normalization of rape in our society hinges on these deeply ingrained lies about the nature of sexual violence			1
in truth , most rapes do n't happen in dark alleys , nor are they usually perpetrated by unknown actors			0
rape occurs among co-workers , classmates , family members and even spouses			0
and rapists can be doctors , lawyers , judges , priests and , yes , professional comedians			0
this does n't mean that @entity3 is guilty -- that is for courts to decide -- but it does mean that his personal biography and achievements do not make him innocent			2
trivializing sexual violence in the past few days , footage of @entity3 's old comedy routines has begun to circulate around the @entity185			1
one clip worthy of extreme concern was his 1969 " spanish fly " routine , where he jokes about the erotic effects of slipping a substance into women 's drinks			0
of course , this is far from a smoking gun			0
in all likelihood @entity3 saw no connection between this standup routine , which was wildly popular among fans and critics , and rape culture			1
unfortunately , that is precisely the point			0
jokes about @entity205 fly , pro-rape college chants and nearly universal axioms about " not dropping the soap " in prison are all part of a perverted cultural logic that minimizes the immorality , illegality , and trauma of rape			0
turning rapists into victims over the past week , @entity3 has received support from a unlikely coalition of people			2
black radicals have argued that @entity3 is being attacked because of white supremacist antipathy toward successful black men			2
many of the same liberals who ran to @entity226 , @entity227 , hours after @entity229 's death , criticizing our dysfunctional justice system and demanding immediate justice , are now preaching the virtues of patience and due process			0
conservatives like @entity237 have claimed that @entity3 is being punished by the liberal media for his righteous moral crusades against the black community			0
few things can unite @entity13 's warring political factions like a commitment to shielding men from accountability for sexual violence .			1

@entity248 : the way people talk about @entity3 allegations is revealing
hill : for many , the alleged victims were *validated* when a male comedian raised the issue
we live in a " rape culture " where claims of rape are minimized , he says
hill : people shield men from accountability for sexual violence
