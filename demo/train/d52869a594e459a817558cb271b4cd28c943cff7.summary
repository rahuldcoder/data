-- as a campaign for @entity4 women to defy the driving ban in their country heats up , one of the country 's leading female bloggers was detained in @entity11 on thursday after a woman she was with did just that			1
@entity14 , who tweets as @entity15 and has been one of the leading voices urging @entity4 women to get behind the wheel on october 26 , was in a car that was stopped by police in @entity11 , the capital , as she filmed another woman driving			1
@entity22 , who has been calling on @entity4 women to upload videos of themselves driving in different parts of the kingdom , spoke exclusively with @entity0 on friday about what happened			1
" yesterday , i kept getting called by women i know who wanted me to film them driving , " she said , explaining how she spent most of the day filming and uploading information about those excursions online			1
" when i was live tweeting , some people took it into their heads that we had to be stopped , " said @entity32 , " and then called the police			2
" she was live tweeting as they were pulled over , posting a picture of the police car that had pulled alongside them , accompanied by the message , " police stopped us			1
" that tweet set off a flurry of concern and supportive messages from @entity50 users throughout @entity4			2
@entity22 initially felt queasy about being stopped , but her unease and worry quickly dissipated when she saw that " police were smiling and easygoing , and their attitude was very positive			1
the police were really nice to us			2
" they were taken to the @entity57 , where she and @entity59 , the woman who had driven her , waited			0
" the vibe i got was that they did n't know what to do with us			0
we could see the police going around , calling , waiting , " explained @entity32 , who says she believes this is a sign that the driving campaign has gained momentum and that many in @entity4 , including officials , think the time has come to allow women to drive			1
october 26 campaign women who want @entity4 to lift a de facto ban on their driving have launched an online campaign urging @entity4 women to stage a demonstration by driving cars on october 26			1
" there is no justification for the @entity4 government to prohibit adult women citizens who are capable of driving cars from doing so , " reads part of an online petition on the @entity85 website			1
even though the website was reportedly blocked in @entity4 shortly after its creation in late september , the petition has so far garnered more than 14,000 signatures			2

@entity0 was unable to reach @entity4 's @entity101 and justice ministries for comment on the issue			1
just a day before being stopped by police , @entity32 posted online another video she filmed of a woman driving for two hours throughout @entity11			2
they were not stopped , and the video shows male drivers waving to the women and supporting them with the thumbs - up sign			2
that video quickly went viral , eliciting numerous comments			0
while most were supportive , there was also a negative reaction -- at one point , a hashtag was created calling for @entity32 's arrest			0
@entity22 says her husband was also made to come to the police station thursday			0
when @entity32 was finally told to come inside , she was asked if she knew that what she did was wrong			0
" i said it 's not wrong , " said @entity32 , who was then told to sign two documents : one stating that she would no longer get into a car with a woman driving , and another that she would no longer film women driving			2
when asked if she would adhere to those agreements , @entity32 said that " it does n't matter whether or not i go out			0
this is n't about me			0
this is a people 's movement			0
this is not about me			0
this is about many women			0
" @entity22 , who was in extremely high spirits while speaking via phone with @entity0 , said the experience with police ultimately bolstered her confidence in the movement she is helping spearhead			0
she said the lack of her arrest and her and @entity59 's quick release show that this campaign is making a difference and things are beginning to change			0
other challenges to driving ban the issue of women driving in the conservative kingdom has long been contentious			2
and while such demonstrations are extremely rare , they have been staged at least twice before			0
