" this monumental , unexpected bombshell from president @entity6 -- spoken in private in the summer of 1965 -- set in motion a history - making drama , revealed for the first time in newly public audio tapes			1
in secret recordings and transcripts made exclusive to @entity4 , @entity6 laid out a politically crafty plan that was years in the making to groom @entity1 as the first @entity15 on the high court			1
it was part of a broader @entity19 strategy to implement the president 's civil rights agenda , something he openly hoped would cement his legacy and strengthen the @entity25 ' base			1
@entity1 was unaware of all this when @entity6 first called him on july 7 , 1965			1
@entity1 , then a federal appeals court judge in @entity28 , had been summoned from lunch			1
the president , a master persuader , wastes little time making his point : " i have a rather big problem that i wanted to talk to you about , " he says			2
" i want you to give it some real thought because it 's something that i have thought about for weeks , and i think that we ca n't think of how it affects us personally			2
we 've got to think about the world , and our country			0
" " yes , sir , " @entity1 replies , the usually verbose judge unable to get many more words in the conversation			1
@entity6 then makes the pitch : " i want you to be my solicitor general			1
" " wow , " is all @entity1 can say , clearly in disbelief			1
" i want the top lawyer in the @entity49 representing me before the @entity2 to be a negro			1
and be a damn good lawyer that 's done it before			2
so you have those peculiar qualifications			0
" he adds , " i want to do this job that [ @entity59 ] @entity58 started , and i want to do it the right way			0
" leaving the security of a lifetime job on the bench for an uncertain political post -- where he could be fired at any time -- at first concerns @entity1 , who asks for a day or two to think about the offer			2
but minutes later , he is sold			0
" the answer 's ' yes			2
' " ' do it for the people of the world ' then the president offers a tantalizing hint of bigger things to come			2
" nobody will ever know i talked to you			0
if you decide that you can do it , i think you ought to do it for the people of the world			0
... and if there 's not something better , which i would hope there would be , that you would be more amenable to , there 'll be security for you because i 'm going to be here for quite awhile , " he says confidently			2
that " something , " as later conversations that @entity6 has with top aides reveals , is a @entity2 appointment			1
it would come two years later in 1967			0
the solicitor general spot would be a mere prelude to a bigger stage			0
the tapes are being released by the @entity100 at the @entity101 , which is analyzing and transcribing secret @entity19 tapes from the @entity103 to the @entity104 years			1
this latest disclosure comes as @entity1 is receiving a fresh burst of attention , thanks to a new play on his life starring award - winning actor @entity111			1
his amazing transformation into the civil rights icon is stunning			0
@entity114 will air the play thursday , videotaped from a performance this past summer at @entity3 's @entity116			0
@entity111 told @entity4 his is an honest portrayal			2
" it 's all there , " he said of @entity1 , whom he never met			1
" i mean , we deal with his flaws and we deal with his strengths			0
we deal with his history ; we deal with his disappointments as well as his victories			0
so , it 's all there			0
it 's all there in the show			2
" building on an already strong legacy @entity1 had already cemented his legacy as a pioneering @entity135 lawyer who won 29 of the 32 cases he argued before the justices , his future colleagues			2
that included @entity140 , the landmark ruling ending segregation in public schools			0
by the time of his government appointments , @entity1 was in his mid- 50s and itching for new challenges			2
less than two weeks after his new job offer , @entity6 secretly makes clear he wants more for @entity1			1
on july 20 , 1965 , the president tells economist and informal adviser @entity150 about a pending @entity2 vacancy that will ultimately go to @entity6 friend @entity152			1
but @entity6 is already laying the groundwork for the next court seat			2
" i 'm going to appoint @entity1 to the ( @entity2 ) court , " @entity6 says flatly			1
" not to succeed him ( current justice @entity156 ) , but after he 's solicitor ( general ) for a year			0
after he 's solicitor ( general ) for a year or two , the first vacancy i have			0
i have n't told anybody that , and i do n't want you to , but i brought him here			0
" @entity6 mentions how @entity25 held up @entity1 's 1961 appointment to the federal appeals bench for months			1
the president now believes with @entity1 's proven skill as a legal advocate , he would make a good solicitor general , arguing cases on behalf of the federal government before the high court			1
" at the end of a year or two , " in his new job , @entity6 predicts , " no one can say that he 's not one of the best - qualified men that has ever [ been ] appointed			1
and then i 'm going to appoint him " to the high court			0
going to @entity1 for advice with a relationship established , @entity6 was not shy about calling on his new solicitor general for some practical political advice			1
@entity1 is asked to suggest names of other black leaders suitable for top administration posts , including agency heads and ambassadorships			2
the solicitor general suggests @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189			0
@entity1 , despite being among just a handful of top black officials in the administration , appears slightly uncomfortable seeming to speak for all african - americans in a purely political context			1
" you got any suggestions , things we ought to be doing in this @entity201 field that we 're not ? i see that they say they 're getting very disillusioned with @entity6 , " says the president , referring to himself in the third person			1
" well , i 'm going to get together with some of them within the two - week period and try to find out what 's going on , " replies @entity1			1
" i 'm having great difficulty in finding out what they want			0
" that comment may reflect the internal divisions among many in the civil rights movement over direction and strategy in the wake of passage of the @entity219 , @entity220 and the rev. @entity221 " speech just a few years earlier			0
but it is clear from this conversation that @entity6 is using @entity1 's grooming for the @entity2 as the model he will use to boost other outstanding @entity15 candidates to senior government positions			1
by october 1966 , some in the @entity6 circle had begun quietly offering trial balloons in the press over whether @entity1 might be a suitable justice			1
one @entity235 writer suggested he would not			0
" did you see the column today by @entity238 ? " @entity6 asks @entity239 , his former attorney general			2
" he 's got a mean -- saying that @entity1 's not the best - qualified man			1
that 's the net of it			0
" in a later conversation , @entity6 's reveals @entity1 remains on his mind , and he reaches out to key lawmakers and civil rights leaders for their advice			1
" i want to build him up where he 's impenetrable when he becomes a @entity2 justice , " says the president			1
but he adds the future nominee knows nothing of this			0
" i 've never told him i 'm going to appoint him , and do n't know that i am			0
but he 's damn sure going to be qualified			0
" opportunity knocks for @entity6 when justice @entity257 announced his retirement , the president was ready to make his move			1
on june 13 , 1967 , just moments before he separately calls @entity1 to be his nominee , @entity6 tells attorney general @entity261 -- whose father @entity1 was about to replace -- of his plans			1
he dismisses whispers from some in @entity3 that @entity1 is not ready to sit on the nation 's highest court			1
" he does n't fit the mold			0
he 's not a @entity270 man and that kind of stuff , you know , " says @entity257 helpfully			0
" just a big , easy - going , very humane - type person			0
he does n't change his behavior to suit other people			0
does n't wear striped pants			0
i think it 's a combination of those two factors " the public will embrace			0
the two men discuss how the @entity283 will treat @entity1 , who will be ultimately confirmed later that summer			2
the day after the historic 69 - 11 @entity283 vote , @entity1 's wife , @entity284 , known as @entity285 to her friends , calls the president personally to thank him			1
" now that i have stopped trembling a little , and now that we 're more or less legal , i thought i 'd like to call you and thank you again so much for the faith you have shown in @entity292 and so much that you have done for everybody			0
" @entity6 replies in a sweet , soft voice , " well , i know he 'll be very worthy of it , and i know that both of us will be proud of him			2
" @entity1 served on the @entity2 until 1991			1
he died in early 1993 .			0
