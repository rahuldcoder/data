-- who walks away from $ 10 million ? who creates something beloved and beautiful that will eventually earn him well in excess of $ 10 million , and says he does n't want the money ? the answer is a story of generosity and grace that seems fitting for this season of giving			1
i was doing some research on the great songwriter @entity15 , who , with his family , fled oppression in @entity18 when he was 5 years old and came to the @entity19			1
he knew no @entity20 ; he grew up in poverty on @entity23 's @entity22			2
he wrote the lyrics and melodies to more than 1,500 songs , including some of the most popular in history : " @entity29 , " " @entity30 , " " @entity31 , " " @entity32 , mr. @entity33 , " " @entity34			0
" his feel for the sound of words was close to perfect ; if you want to learn the craft of writing , not only music , but any kind of effective writing , study the lyrics -- the precision , the economy , the playfulness , the respect for language and cadence -- of @entity15 's " there 's @entity51			1
" there is not a wasted syllable			0
because " @entity29 " -- the cherished holiday song written by the @entity56 immigrant -- will , as usual , be played and sung often this month , i was trying to find out all i could about @entity15 's life and career			1
and came upon an astonishing , profoundly moving act of altruism			0
it has to do with the song he considered the most important he ever wrote -- the song that meant the most to him			0
in 1938 , the vocalist @entity65 was looking for a song to sing on her coast - to - coast @entity68 radio program to commemorate the 20th anniversary of @entity71			2
she asked @entity15 if he would write something for her			2
he remembered a song he had begun years before , and had discarded			2
he brought it out and went back to work on it			0
thus it was that , on the @entity68 radio network one november night , @entity65 delivered the first public performance of @entity15 's " @entity80			1
" the acclaim was immediate and electrifying			0
the world was on the verge of a terrible new war ; all over the @entity19 , people heard @entity15 's song and took it to their hearts			1
he understood what a valuable property he had on his hands			0
and he quietly made a firm decision : he never wanted to make a penny from it			0
he wanted whatever success the song had to be his gift to the nation he adored			1
" he believed that the @entity19 had rescued his life , " @entity99 , author of the @entity15 biography " as thousands cheer , " told me			2
" this was his genuine patriotic gesture			0
he had a real soft spot for @entity19 , and this is how he expressed it			0
" @entity15 instructed attorneys to draw up papers			2
he wanted to guarantee that every cent " @entity80 " ever earned went to a place that he thought would help to make the country 's future brighter and stronger			1
in those months leading up to the @entity19 entry into @entity114 , he selected the @entity115 and the @entity116 to receive the song 's earnings -- specifically , he wanted the royalties to go to @entity120 and girl scout programs in impoverished and disadvantaged areas			1
his binding legal instructions are in effect to this day , 73 years after " @entity80 " was first sung by @entity65 and 22 years after @entity15 's death			1
so far , there has been more than $ 10 million distributed to scouting programs , and it 's still coming in			1
" @entity15 and his heirs have never collected a penny , " said @entity129 , an executive in the office that administers the earnings from @entity15 's songs			1
" he was always a staunch protector of his copyrights , " said musicologist @entity135 , who wrote her @entity136 on the song , and who is working on a book about it for @entity141			0
" for him to do this with ' @entity80 ' was his sincere thank you to the country			2
" trustees of the fund @entity15 set up are free to allocate the money to programs where they feel it will be beneficial			1
it has gone to different scouting organizations over the years			0
the current recipients of the royalties are the @entity157 of the @entity115 and @entity116			0
officials for both groups told me it is impossible to overestimate how much good the " @entity80 " royalties continue to do for boys and girls with few advantages or resources ; there are scouting programs in homeless shelters and public housing projects that would not exist were it not for the fund			1
the popularity of the song has seen ebbs and flows over the years			2
the country seems to find it anew when it is needed			0
on september 11 , 2001 , after the attacks , members of @entity179 stood together , republicans and @entity185 shoulder - to - shoulder , on the steps of the @entity183 and , seemingly spontaneously , joined in singing " @entity80			1
" that signaled a renaissance for the song ; it is now regularly heard at sporting events and public gatherings			0
in the final years of @entity15 's life , he grew reclusive			1
he had not had a hit song in decades			0
rock music and performances by singer - songwriters had replaced the kind of music he had mastered			0
but even toward the end , he found comfort in knowing how many young people the royalties from " @entity80 " were helping			1
his belief was simple : everyone , regardless of background or beginnings , should be given a chance to shine			0
after all , look what happened to him			0
the money will continue to go to @entity120 organizations as long as " @entity80 " is sung and played -- which is to say , as long as there is a @entity19			1
who walks away from $ 10 million ? @entity15 did			1
why ? the answer is as clear and direct as the second line in that song of his : "			0
. " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			2

@entity224 : who walks away from $ 10 million ? the *composer* of " @entity80 " did
@entity18 - born songwriter @entity15 saw it as " his gift to the nation he adored , " says @entity224

@entity224 : for *70* years , the money has been *donated* to @entity120 and @entity240 programs
