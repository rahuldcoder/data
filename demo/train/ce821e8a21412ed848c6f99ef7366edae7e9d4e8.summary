-- @entity1 remembers when he was 5 years old and his parents were getting ready for a dinner party			1
he spied his mother reaching for a necklace , and he recommended that she wear a different one			2
then he turned to his father and boldly suggested he wear a different tie with his shirt -- and not be afraid to mix patterns			1
" that was the moment , " @entity1 said			1
" i think i was instinctively choosing things that suited them more			2
i 've always felt there was an appropriateness for each person			2
" it is no surprise that @entity1 followed his passion to @entity20 to study costume design , then pursued a career in fashion			1
for a new season of warm - weather fashion trends , the @entity25 - winning stylist is sharing his " @entity30 " philosophy that has aided his celebrity clients			0
in @entity1 's eyes , not only is each person unique in their appearance , but they have " true colors " that are inherent , and indicative of their personality and style -- found in a person 's eyes , hair and skin tones			1
the stylist also offers help in his book , " @entity46 , " which came out in paperback last year			1
@entity1 sat down with @entity0 for an interview last week to talk about spring and summer fashions , how to wear them in your own way and why everyone should embrace their true colors			1
the following is a transcript edited for length and clarity			0
@entity0 : what is your style philosophy ? @entity1 : if you think about it like this , you are the subject of a great painting and what you chose to fill in around you illuminates you , or it can make you recede			1
i feel there has been a lot of mystery around what looks good on people			0
my goal with all of this is i really believe that everyone has the right to look and feel fantastic			0
everyone loves compliments , especially the compliment " you look great , " as opposed to " great fill - in - the - brand - name - skirt - here			0
" color is not that much of a commodity -- it 's attainable and the perfect way to express who we are			1
your clothes and color should be used as raw materials to illustrate you -- you are the focal point			0
your skin tone is your skin tone , you can either embrace it and illuminate it , or you can distract from it			0
your skin , eyes and hair exist as givens , then you fill in the rest around it			0
it 's very important to be who we are , we 're all so unique , and i really want to triumph the individual			1
@entity0 : what are those key looks for spring and summer ? @entity1 : one of the things i would say is an important piece is the draped skirt			1
if you never have worn a pencil skirt , and you know it 's not your best , do n't do a draped pencil skirt			1
but if you always wear a-line and feel great in it , do a draped a-line skirt if you want to update			1
take the trends and customize them for you			0
also , white is a huge thing right now , which every couple of years it comes back , and this year is a more diaphanous approach where you 're layering and so on			1
individualize it by choosing your white			1
if you never wear stark white , and you look better in ivory , wear ivory			2
you do n't have to follow the trends to the runway level , you should follow them to the customized version of you level			0
the way to find your white is you should match the white of your eyes			2
another big trend are baroque patterns -- big chains and medallion prints			1
these very large prints can be overpowering			0
a great rule of thumb is if the print repeat is bigger than your head , it 's too large			2
if you are someone who feels much better in solids , do it in an accessory -- a scarf or handbag that has that print on it			0
@entity0 : were there any designers whose styles you were particularly excited to see in the spring or summer collection ? @entity1 : there are several			1
@entity154 makes me excited every year			1
the fact that she creates the scale of the collection that she does every year and it has just enough theatricality to it to make the pieces stand out , yet they do n't look like costumes			0
she really is a talented designer with the perfect mix -- the balance is fantastic			0
i also love the dress designer @entity167			1
his dresses for spring are completely up - to - the - minute exciting , and a variety of silhouettes			2
@entity171 is very good , i 'm loving what i 'm seeing there			1
i really think it is a very exciting spring season			2
the reason i 'm excited about the designers i 'm mentioning is they are n't just connected to one thing , they are doing nice variety			1
@entity0 : how do you embrace your style amidst the changing seasons ? @entity1 : dressing in layers is always a good idea and prepare for what you 're going to do that way as well			1
@entity188 , @entity189 , there area a lot of cities like this where each particular day can be drastically different			0
throw a sweater in your bag , dress with a layer that can come off and think ahead of time			0
the best thing to do is think about the fabric of your clothing			0
as beautiful as linen is , it 's not going to last until lunch -- it 's going to be a wrinkled mess			2
@entity205 is going to breathe			0
natural fabrics that have a little weight to them are always going to be your friend because they will last through the day			0
@entity0 : because the styles are more open this season , are there any key pieces that a lot of people can wear ? @entity1 : one of the trends is very bright , neon , what i call hyper - @entity223 colors -- very , very vivid , and i would say that if you want to have that , take one of the colors the looks great on you , and do it in an unexpected piece , like a skirt or coat			1
a lot of times , we think of these vivid colors in accents or smaller things , i think this is the season to embrace the vividness			2
i 'm not saying just because tangerine tango is the color of spring that everyone should wear it			2
if the brightest color on your palette is an @entity246 beauty rose pink , why do n't you use that in an unexpected way ? wearing a color that does n't suit you , you 're not going to be comfortable			2
@entity0 : what do you address in your book , " @entity46 " ? @entity1 : i address the idea that we all have an authentic style and true colors			1
in the first part of the book , i lead you to finding these true colors and what is your dramatic , romantic and energy color , and they all do very different things			1
some make you feel very friendly and approachable , some make you feel sexy			0
in the second part , i lead you to one of 24 archetypes -- i believe there are 24 archetypes of women			0
with each archetype , i give you fragrance ideas , style ideas , fabrics , artists that represent your type , the must - haves , the must - avoids , the super power and the kryptonite			0
it 's a read on the personality as well and really how to put a palette and a wardrobe together			2
in part three of the book , i teach you how to utilize all of these tools in shopping and cleaning out your closet			0
when you shop , do it with intention			0
and i also lead you to how to dress for every occasion			0
i really want people to honor their true colors and honor who they are in their authentic style			1
then , i want them to really love themselves and flourish with this material .			0

@entity1 writes in " the @entity46 " that individuals have " true colors " that suit them
this spring , he recommends draped skirts , baroque patterns and shades of white
