-- @entity2 villagers close to the disputed @entity3 began returning to their homes tuesday following a decision in the @entity6 -- the @entity8 's highest court -- that awarded sovereignty over most of the land around the temple to @entity12			1
residents displaced by simmering tensions began returning to the border region , convinced the @entity6 verdict will restore peace , according to @entity2 's @entity19 newspaper			1
a panel of judges ruled on monday that the promontory on which the temple sits was part of @entity12 , although the court did not give @entity12 full control over all the territory saying it had no jurisdiction over a nearby hill -- known as @entity30 - that formed part of the dispute			1
" in consequence , @entity2 was under an obligation to withdraw from that territory the @entity2 military or police forces or other guards or keepers that were stationed there , " president of the @entity6 @entity43 said in the judgement			2
in a televised address , @entity2 prime minister @entity44 said that @entity2 would hold talks with @entity12 to finally resolve the 51 - year - old dispute			1
'' @entity2 will enter negotiations with @entity12 to put an end to the issue , '' she said in a nationally televised press conference			0
" i would like all @entity52 to be confident that the government will be at its best in protecting national interests			0
" the @entity12 prime minister @entity56 called for calm ahead of the court decision this week , saying that @entity2 and @entity12 intended to abide by the court 's decision			2
" i would appeal to the armed forces fulfilling their duties in the border area to maintain calmness , patience and avoid actions that would cause tension or eventual clashes , " he said in a statement			0
the 11th century hindu temple sits atop a cliff on @entity12 soil but has its most accessible entrance on the @entity2 side			2
the two countries differ on whether some territory around the temple forms part of @entity2 or @entity12			1
the @entity79 - based @entity6 awarded the temple to @entity12 in 1962			1
@entity2 claims , however , that the 1.8 square mile ( 4.6 sq. km ) area around it was never fully demarcated			0
@entity2 says the dispute arose from the fact that the @entity12 government used a map drawn during the @entity87 occupation of @entity12 - a map that places the temple and surrounding area in @entity12 territory			1
in 2008 , the @entity8 approved @entity12 's application to have the temple listed as a @entity93 -- a place the @entity8 says has outstanding universal value			1
the decision re-ignited tensions , with some in @entity2 fearing it will make it difficult for their country to lay claim to disputed land around the temple			2
both sides agreed to withdraw troops from the disputed area in december 2011 following border skirmishes earlier that year that left five people dead			0
as many as 27,000 people were displaced by the fighting			0
one @entity2 nationalist group , the @entity111 , has said it would reject any judgment from the @entity6 , according to @entity19 newspaper			0
" @entity2 people who know the reality would not allow the government to comply with the @entity6 judgement			0
what the government has done could be deemed as ' selling the nation ' to foreigners , " @entity118 , leader of @entity111 , told @entity19 .			0
