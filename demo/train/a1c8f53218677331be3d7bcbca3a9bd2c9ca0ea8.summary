-- as he watched wounded troops being brought inside the hospital on stretchers , @entity1 could n't believe what he was seeing			1
" you see this stuff in movies , but i was watching it happen , " said @entity1 , recalling a 2003 visit to the @entity6 in @entity7			1
" there were so many casualties coming in -- busloads of them			2
" @entity1 made the visit to learn more about the needs of wounded servicemen and women			1
" when these guys come back from war , they are broken , " he said , reflecting on the missing limbs , traumatic brain injuries and other devastating wounds he observed			2
@entity1 's eldest son , @entity27 , was treated at @entity6 in 2003 , after his humvee was hit by a rocket - propelled grenade in @entity30			1
he recovered from his injuries , but his dad was heartbroken when he realized that other wounded troops did n't have the support his son did			1
" we have a tight , cohesive family			2
not all of them do , " said @entity1 , 59			1
" some of them do n't have anybody to come home to			2
... " when i first went to @entity6 to visit , i wanted to take them all home with me			0
" instead , he started a scholarship program -- the @entity50 -- to support disabled veterans and help them become self - sufficient			1
since 2003 , @entity1 and his foundation have assisted more than 100 veterans with housing , education , jobs -- whatever they need to adapt to their new lives			1
" every one of them is different , " @entity1 said			1
" some will need service dogs , guide dogs , housing assistance , special equipment put through the house , drivers			2
" @entity66 , 33 , was injured by an improvised explosive device five years ago in @entity30 , and he spent 15 months at @entity6			0
he lost his right eye and had a titanium rod placed in his leg , and he said he did n't have much hope for the future			2
but through @entity1 's program , @entity66 received more than $ 60,000 for a vehicle , housing assistance , furniture and household goods			1
he also received valuable mentorship and advice that has helped him make his engineering and building firm successful			0
@entity66 is now paying it forward by hiring other veterans			2
" i think ( for ) every wounded veteran , every disabled veteran out there , the drive is now double of what it was before , " @entity66 said			2
" because you want to be seen as normal			0
you want to be successful			0
" @entity66 has been thankful for @entity1 's personal guidance along the way			1
" mr. @entity1 's helped me build my business , " he said			1
" i go back to mr. @entity1 and say , ' hey , this is what i want to do ' ... and he gives me his input			1
" @entity1 , a former real estate agent from @entity95 , @entity96 , is a father figure for many of the " @entity50 " in his program			1
he said he usually hears from four or five of them a day			0
" i have an intimate knowledge of what 's going on with them , " he said			0
" most , if not all , have my cell phone number			0
" @entity1 also has teams based in 28 states across the country , ready to help veterans in need			1
these teams partner with local businesses and individuals who are willing to donate their services , time and money			0
it 's this community support that is crucial to the program 's success , @entity1 said			1
" these kids grew up in our neighborhoods , went to our schools and churches , played on our ball fields , " he said			0
" we need to welcome them back into their communities with open arms			0
" @entity1 never served in the military , but his three sons are @entity131 -- one is in @entity132 -- and his brothers served in @entity134			1
he said he has always taken note of the treatment of men and women in the military			1
" one of the things that bothered me as a kid when my brothers were in @entity134 was that nobody from our community knew their names or faces , " @entity1 said			1
" and i could see that happening again			0
" the @entity149 rigorously screens each candidate , and scholarship recipients must continually provide status updates to keep getting assistance			2
but it 's not just about the money , @entity1 said			1
it 's about building relationships and reintegrating people into society			0
" we do n't just write a check , " he said			2
" we walk with them until they are successful			0
" recently , @entity1 picked up his phone and heard @entity166 ' shaky voice on the other end			1
@entity166 , 27 , is a retired @entity168 who lost his legs when he stepped on an ied in @entity30			0
" i want to tell you something before you hear it from someone else , " @entity166 said			0
a medical scare ? a death ? his mind was racing			0
" i got a c in one my classes , " @entity166 replied			0
" and i want to explain why			0
" @entity166 is pursuing a bachelor 's degree at @entity182 , and @entity1 's group has assisted him with tuition , rent and expenses like his computer			1
when @entity1 heard that @entity166 ' news was just a bad grade , he felt more than relief			1
" i was proud that he trusts me enough to give me a call , " @entity1 said			2
" it showed tremendous character			0
" for @entity1 , that 's what his program is all about			1
" what we try to do is focus on the future , the potential , " he said			0
" we ca n't focus on the injury , even though it 's hard not to because you 're looking at a young man with no legs or arms , or burns			2
" you really have to listen hard , look into their eyes , look for that spark that says : ' this guy has potential			0
let 's see what we can do to help him get there			0
' " want to get involved ? check out the @entity149 website and see how to help .			0
