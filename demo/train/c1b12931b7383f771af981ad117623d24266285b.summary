there was a recent survey of the top airports in the country -- in the world -- and there was not a single @entity4 airport that came in the top 25			1
not one -- not one @entity4 airport was considered by the experts and consumers who use these airports to be in the top 25 in the world			1

politics aside , the president is correct that @entity33 's airport was ranked 30th on a recent list of the world 's top 100 airports			1
@entity40 was the first @entity4 airport to appear on the list , released earlier this month as part of the @entity43			2

of the top 10 airports , five were in @entity52 and four were in @entity53			0
@entity54 , ranked no. 8 , was the only @entity56 airport to make the top 10			0
17 @entity4 airports made the top 100 : no. 30 : @entity33 / @entity40 no. 36 : @entity60 no. 40 : @entity61 no. 48 : @entity62 no. 54 : @entity64 / @entity63 no. 62 : @entity65 no. 63 : @entity67 @entity66 no. 71 : @entity68 no. 79 : @entity69 no. 80 : @entity71 @entity70 no. 84 : @entity72 no. 86 : @entity73 no. 87 : @entity74 / @entity75 no. 88 : @entity76 no. 93 : @entity77 no. 94 : @entity78 no. 97 : @entity79 check in : @entity81 's best airport hotels @entity82 's @entity43 are based on 12.1 million survey questionnaires filled out by passengers covering 108 different nationalities and 395 airports worldwide during a nine - month survey period in 2012 and 2013			1
