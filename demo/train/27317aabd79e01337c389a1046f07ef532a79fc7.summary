@entity0 -- same - sex marriage is a non-issue in @entity5 politics			1
ok , that might be a bit of an overstatement , but it seems to be causing less of a firestorm lately than when it was a dependable wedge issue			0
when attorney general @entity12 announced saturday at the @entity14 's gala that the federal government will expand the recognition of same - sex marriages in federal legal matters , including bankruptcies , prison visits and survivor benefits , it barely moved the political crisis dial			1
the @entity24 world was relatively quiet			0
news releases from both @entity26 and @entity27 were few and far between			2
the topic was barely mentioned on the sunday political talk shows			0
the biggest fallout might be more about president @entity32 's use of executive action to push his agenda rather than the issue itself			1
it 's not that this announcement is n't a big deal , because " it 's a very big deal , " said @entity40 , a @entity27 donor and former campaign manager for @entity43 's 2004 presidential campaign			0
although @entity12 's announcement is an extension of the @entity48 's decision last year striking down the @entity49 , it 's a definitive statement on the @entity32 administration 's policy position			1
" just like during the civil rights movement of the 1960s , the stakes involved in this generation 's struggle for @entity58 equality could not be higher , " @entity12 said saturday			0
" as attorney general , i will not let this department be simply a bystander during this important moment in history			0
" same sex marriage fast facts @entity27 @entity66 sen. @entity66 said sunday on @entity67 ' " @entity68 " that the announcement is " logical , it 's consistent , it 's passionate			0
" but one day after @entity12 's announcement , conservatives , who tend to oppose same - sex marriage , have said little			1
@entity26 @entity66 sen. @entity72 of @entity73 said on @entity74 ' " @entity68 " that it " appears to be another example of the @entity32 administration imposing its will on the states " and noted that same - sex marriage is legal in her state			1
it " could " be an issue in other states where it is not , she said			2
that 's not exactly a seething denouncement			0
the issue has come a long way in the court of public opinion , as a majority of @entity5 now support same - sex marriage			1
according to a national @entity93 poll from september , 56 % of @entity5 support marriage for same - sex couples , compared with only 25 % who supported it in 1996			1
a @entity1 poll in 2010 was the first time a poll found that a majority of respondents backed it			0
@entity26 strategist @entity103 said sunday on @entity1 's " @entity104 " that opinions on same - sex marriage represent the " most rapid social change that we 've seen in our lifetime			1
" @entity109 said @entity26 politicians ' positions are evolving , too , but they are n't too vocal about it			2
she said @entity26 views on the issue are changing rapidly , but politicians " may not be out there because there 's no reason to take the political hit if there 's no legislation in front of them			1
" the political hit could come from the party base , among whom opposition is more common			0
the same @entity93 poll found that 36 % of @entity26 back same - sex marriage in their states			1
@entity109 insisted , however , that opinions are changing quickly among @entity26 voters and that by the 2016 presidential election , it might be " much less of a point than it is today			2
" the last five years have seen a tremendous amount of change on the issue			0
more than a dozen states have legalized same - sex marriage , and @entity32 is the first president to endorse it			1
support for gay rights generally has increased , as evidenced late last year when the @entity148 passed the @entity149 , which would outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation in the workplace			0
it was the first time the @entity148 had passed the measure , and it won 10 @entity26 votes			2
@entity26 strategist @entity156 , president of @entity157 , said : " there is so much else the @entity26 should focus on			1
i imagine that they wo n't spend much time pounding away at this issue			0
" @entity40 said the administration 's decision was not a political risk for @entity32 or the @entity27 leading into the 2014 midterm elections			1
" there 's not a political downside for @entity32			2
there 's none , " he said			0
@entity40 noted that gay rights ' issues in politics are no longer a niche issue but rather appeal to many voters			0
" it 's not about gay voters any more , it 's about any voter under the age of 40 , " he said			0
@entity180 warns his former home state , @entity182 , could turn blue not everyone has stayed out of the fray , however			0
former @entity186 governor and potential 2016 @entity26 presidential candidate @entity187 , who also appeals to social conservatives , sent an e-mail to his supporters shortly after @entity12 's announcement			2
" is it a surprise this administration is picking and choosing the laws they like ? " the e-mail read			0
it included included a link to the @entity1 story about @entity12 's announcement and asked for support of @entity202 , his political action committee , and the @entity198 fund			2
same - sex marriage could become a campaign issue in some of the more conservative districts and states around the country , where incumbents could face challenges from the right , especially in the more than two dozen states that have constitutional amendments banning same - sex marriage			1
a @entity26 operative said people could " probably see this as another overreach by the @entity32 administration to subvert their will			1
" even @entity32 's evolution on the issue , from opposing same - sex marriage to supporting it , still has not satisfied @entity58 activists and supporters			1
for one , he has not indicated that same - sex marriage should be addressed at the federal level to eliminate the patchwork of laws around the country			1
while reaction might be much more muted , for proponents , the issue is far from won .			2

political reaction to more federal recognition of same - sex marriages to all states muted
a @entity26 strategist said @entity26 ' views on the issue are changing
some lgbt activists want more action from the @entity32 administration
