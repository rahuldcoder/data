@entity0 -- a former head of the @entity3 slammed president @entity4 on sunday for releasing four @entity6 - era memos , saying the new president has compromised national security			1
former @entity3 chief @entity9 said sunday it is wrong to make interrogation methods public			1
@entity9 , who served as former president @entity6 's last @entity3 director from 2006 to 2009 , said releasing the memos outlining terror interrogation methods emboldened terrorist groups such as @entity16			1
" what we have described for our enemies in the midst of a war are the outer limits that any @entity23 would ever go to in terms of interrogating an @entity16 terrorist			0
that 's very valuable information , " @entity9 said during an appearance on " @entity27			2
" " by taking [ certain ] techniques off the table , we have made it more difficult -- in a whole host of circumstances i can imagine -- for @entity3 officers to defend the nation , " he said			1
but sens. @entity38 , @entity39 , and @entity40 , @entity42 - @entity41 , said certain techniques should not have been allowed in the first place			1
@entity38 called them " a great recruitment tool for those who want to do harm to our country			2
" @entity51 chief of staff @entity50 dismissed @entity9 's assertion that releasing the memos had undermined @entity23 intelligence efforts by giving @entity16 critical new information			1
" one of the reasons the president was willing to let this information out was that already the information was out , " he said on @entity57 's " @entity56			0
" " go get the @entity63			0
" @entity9 said he called several senior @entity51 officials to express his opposition before the president released the documents			1
@entity9 also noted that four previous @entity3 directors , as well as current agency director @entity71 , opposed the release			1
the memos said , among other things , that interrogation tactics such as waterboarding , sleep deprivation and slapping did not violate laws against torture absent the intent to cause severe pain			2
@entity4 prohibited the use of so - called " enhanced interrogation techniques " such as waterboarding shortly after taking office in january			2
such techniques " undermine our moral authority and do not make us safer , " he said thursday , when the @entity51 released the memos			1
the @entity4 administration has said it wo n't pursue charges against @entity3 officers who used those tactics against prisoners in their custody			1
and @entity50 told @entity57 that the people who crafted the policy " should not be prosecuted either			0
" but in a sharply worded editorial sunday , the @entity96 called for the impeachment of @entity99 , a federal appeals court judge who was a @entity100 official when he wrote one of the memos that authorized those techniques			0
" these memos make it clear that mr. @entity99 is unfit for a job that requires legal judgment and a respect for the @entity109 , " the newspaper editorialized			0
the memos " were written to provide legal immunity for acts that are clearly illegal , immoral and a violation of this country 's most basic values , " it stated			0
asked about that call on " @entity27 , " @entity38 said : " i think we have to look at it			0
" @entity38 , a member of the @entity120 's standing investigative subcommittee , said the @entity4 administration made the right decision by agreeing not to prosecute intelligence officers			2
but she added : " a lawyer that 's responsible for this kind of advice that clearly went too far in terms of stretching what our law is -- it worries me that he 's sitting on the federal bench right now			0
" @entity40 , however , said seeking to punish lawyers who advised the @entity6 administration " is a very bad precedent			1
" " i think it would be disaster to go back and try to prosecute a lawyer for giving legal advice that you disagreed with to a former president , " said @entity40 , a member of the @entity137 and a lawyer in the @entity140 reserve			0
@entity9 said the administration 's decision to release the @entity6 administration memos will make @entity3 officials less willing to engage in interrogation tactics now sanctioned by the federal government			1
" the basic foundation of the legitimacy of the agency 's action has shifted from some durability of law to a product of the @entity23 political process			2
that puts agency officers in a horrible position , " he said			1
" the really dangerous effect of this [ decision ] is that you 'll have agency officers stepping back from the kinds of things that the nation expects them to do			0
... you 're going to have this agency -- on the front line of defending you in this current war -- playing back from the line , " he said			0
@entity9 also said that , contrary to the assertions of many critics , the interrogation techniques in question had forced suspected terrorists to reveal valuable information and made the country safer			2
he predicted that the release of the memos would be " just the beginning			0
" " there will be more revelations , more commissions , there will be more investigations , " @entity9 said			0
@entity38 told " @entity27 " that the @entity23 will be better off in the long run by clearly prohibiting interrogation techniques such as waterboarding			2
and @entity40 said that while he was concerned that the release of the memos was a " huge tactical and strategic mistake done for political reasons , " the decision to allow certain enhanced interrogation techniques was a mistake as well			1
@entity40 added that he always thought waterboarding " was a procedure that would come back to haunt the country , and quite frankly it has			0

@entity9 : releasing @entity6 - era interrogation memos harmful
release puts @entity3 officers " in a horrible position , " subject to political process , he says
@entity51 chief of staff defends release , saying info was already public
sens. @entity38 and @entity40 say techniques were a mistake
