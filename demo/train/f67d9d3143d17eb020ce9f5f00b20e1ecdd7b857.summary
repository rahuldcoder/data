-- we 've all done it -- surfed on over to the book of faces , our hearts racing and pupils dilating with excitement , let our cursors linger over those oh - so - powerful words , " @entity10 , " and clicked away with the maniacal glee of a serial killer			1
still , there are n't that many among us who have the skill -- the expertise -- to cut ties without cutting deep			2
at this point , some of you may be reminiscing about the sepia - tinged past , those glory days when , if you did n't want to chill with @entity19 anymore , all you had to do was ghost out of her life , letting the last tendrils of your friendship dissolve into the ether like wisps of smoke			0
well , those days are as dead as @entity19 's creepy gray front teeth			1
now , every time someone exits your life , you have to decide whether to keep them in your @entity36 stream or cut the lifeline			0
" friends and acquaintances come and go as we move through life stages and find the need for keeping some friends and losing others , " says dr. @entity38 , author of " rewired : understanding the @entity46 and the way they learn			0
" " if you had no way to unfriend someone , then this would lose the authenticity of having a relationship			1
" you hear that ? @entity56 is practically doctor - approved			0
still , how do you know when -- and how -- to take the pal - eviscerating plunge ? read on for our tips on handling unfriending situations			1
the ex-friend we 've all nixed an ex-friend at one time or another			1
one group is even urging users to purge their @entity36 feeds of annoying pals this week by declaring it @entity70			0
in fact , in an online poll of about 800 of our friends and readers , 43 percent said they were most likely to ax a close acquaintance when erasing a @entity36 friendship			1
@entity78 usually happens because of one of two scenarios : one , your best guy friend 's girlfriend hates you , a situation that led to a knock - down , drag - out fight at a local watering hole			1
two , you used to chill with this dude back when you lived in @entity88 , dreaming of the jug band you would form when you moved to the big city			0
now you actually live in the big city , where you do , indeed , have a jug band ( ironically , of course ) , and homeboy is still back in the cornfields			0
in scenario one , it would probably be a good idea to reach out one last time -- in the real - world realm -- and see if you can sort out whatever bs went down at the bar			0
if , in the end , your former best boy persists in the venom - spewing and un-pleasantries , it 's probably more healthy to remove him from that glorious realm of time - wastery			1
seeing his face pop up among photos of @entity112 's wedding and @entity114 's new kitten ai n't gon na do much for your sanity			1
in scenario two , it 's up to you to gauge how much @entity119 's presence offends you			1
according to @entity120 , who penned " @entity56 on @entity36 : @entity129 and @entity130 , " a paper he 'll be presenting at the @entity123 , 50 percent of people who have unfriended someone saw the person in question zero times in the past year			1
if your former friend has no impact on your current life , and you do n't foresee yourself getting the band back together , why keep him in your cyber stable ? ( if you 're one of those other 50 percent who see the faded friend on a more frequent basis , you may want to rethink the " unfriend			1
" nothing is more awkward than attending a party replete with ghosts of camaraderie past			0
) the ex most of the time , it 's probably best to hit " @entity140 " after the whole , " it 's not you , it 's me " talk			1
out of sight , out of mind , and all that			0
but it seems like a lot of folks like to keep tabs on their exes via @entity36 -- only 22 percent of those surveyed said that they were most likely to unfriend an ex. hey , i guess it 's easier to make drunken , nostalgic mistakes when you still have access to their wall , huh ? if you do decide to take the plunge , be gentle			1
if you 're the dumper , cut your ex a break : let him / her unfriend you			2
it 's the least you can do after putting his / her heart through this meat grinder called love			2
if you 're the dumpee , and the object of your unrequited attention feeds you some line about still wanting to be " friends " ( an option that 's about as enticing as forming a cuddle pile with your ex , her new dude and a couple of rabid skunks ) , send her a message before you clicky - click her outta your life			2
now , if your ex is basically @entity191 , just take aim and fire			0
and no one will blame you if you let out the littlest of evil laughs whilst doing the blocking or unfriending deed			2
the enemy who friended you yup			0
he tortured you in grade school by mocking your name , your shoes and the way you crossed your t 's			2
now he 's asking to be your friend , albeit a decade or two later via the @entity208			2
@entity209 , you accept his request -- you just wan na know if he ended up marrying @entity211 , the homecoming queen , or if he finally made it to @entity213			0
after seeing that he did , indeed , make @entity211 his @entity214 ( with whom he reared four hideous , mulleted children ) and that he did , indeed , take off to @entity213 ( you thought that dude in that scary @entity219 flick looked familiar ) , you feel no desire to maintain ties with the former bully			0
well , friend , this is your chance to get back at old @entity225 , so unfriend away			2
in fact , 22 percent of those surveyed would pull rather pull the trigger on an old foe than anyone else on @entity36			0
revenge is a dish best served cold , and nothing 's colder than depriving someone of your thoroughly illuminating status updates -- there 's an emo song lyric for every occasion , right ? one last thing : our survey also included the option of " ex-boss , " but only 12 percent of respondents would unfriend that acquaintance over all others			1
good thinking : you really should n't be friends with your boss on @entity36 , anyway .			0
