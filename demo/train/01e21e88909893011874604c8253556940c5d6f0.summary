@entity0 , @entity1 -- a doctor excommunicated by the @entity4 for performing an abortion on a 9 - year - old rape victim received a standing ovation during a national convention on women 's health , according to a local media report			1
archbishop @entity11 excommunicated the doctors who performed the child 's abortion			1
the response came during the opening ceremony of an event hosted by @entity1 minister of health @entity18			1
the newspaper @entity20 reported that @entity18 called on the audience to acknowledge the " brilliant " work done by a medical team in the abortion , performed in @entity1 's northeastern city of @entity26			1
the girl was pregnant with twins after being raped , allegedly by her stepfather , police were quoted in media reports as saying			0
the abuse had gone on since the girl was 6 , authorities said			0
the abortion was performed march 4 during the fourth month of pregnancy , according to media reports archbishop @entity11 of @entity26 excommunicated the doctor , the child 's mother and the medical team involved in the procedure			1
however , the stepfather was not excommunicated , with @entity11 telling @entity44 that , " a graver act than ( rape ) is abortion , to eliminate an innocent life			1
" the child was not excommunicated , @entity11 said , because @entity4 law says minors are exempt from excommunication			1
" the church is benevolent when it comes to minors , " he told @entity44			0
" as for the adults , especially those who approved it , performed this abortion , the excommunication is applicable			2
" " @entity60 's law is above human laws , " @entity11 said			2
the case has outraged the @entity1 public and fueled a controversy reaching the highest levels of church and state in a nation whose law bans abortion except in cases of rape			1
@entity18 recently said doctors must put law before religion			0
" the question posed is very simple			0
there is a @entity1 law which states that a pregnancy can be interrupted in case of rape , " @entity18 said			1
" it is legitimate for the church to have its dogmas , but these dogmas must not be imposed on society as a whole , " he added			0
earlier , a verbal spat ensued between president @entity90 and the archbishop over the church 's decision			2
" as a @entity94 and a @entity4 , i find it deeply lamentable that a bishop of the @entity4 has such a conservative attitude , " @entity90 said on @entity44			2
" in this case , the medical profession was more right than the church , " he said			0
meanwhile , a @entity101 cleric told @entity104 's @entity103 newspaper that he supports the @entity1 archbishop 's decision to excommunicate all involved in the abortion except for the child			1
dr. @entity109 , one of the doctors involved in the procedure , said he thanked the archbishop for his excommunication because the controversy sheds light on @entity1 's restrictive abortion laws			1
he said women in @entity1 's countryside are victimized by @entity1 's ban on abortion			1
some of the doctors vowed to continue attending church services , despite being expelled			0
" the fact that i was excommunicated will not keep me from going to @entity125 , praying , conversing with @entity60 , and asking him to illuminate me and my colleagues in our medical team to help us take care of people in similar cases , " one doctor said			1
@entity44 reported that the child , who is from a town outside @entity26 , has stayed in the city to recover and to escape media coverage			0
her current condition is not known			0
a new report by @entity1 's @entity138 , a non-governmental organization that works with the health ministry , indicates that more than 1 million women undergo illegal abortions in @entity1 each year			1
about 250,000 are treated by doctors for traumas due to botched abortions , said @entity145 , an @entity138 official			0
studies at a @entity1 hospital dedicated to treating female victims of violence , the @entity146 in @entity147 , indicated that more than 40 percent of the cases involved children			2
" this is why the @entity26 case is so important for women in @entity1 , " @entity154 said			2
@entity154 said the liberated " @entity161 " image that many foreigners have of @entity1 women is far from reality			2
" we live in a male chauvinistic , patriarchal society with a very high rate of sexual crimes against women and minors , " she said			0
" our reproductive rights are constantly criminalized			0
" @entity2 's @entity171 contributed to this report .			0
