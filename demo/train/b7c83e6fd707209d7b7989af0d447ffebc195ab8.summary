-- when @entity3 heard @entity5 aid worker @entity4 mention the former prime minister prior to his beheading , it strengthened his resolve to fight @entity9 , he said sunday			1
" it makes me even more determined to take these people on and beat them , " @entity3 said in an interview on @entity0 's " @entity11			2
" before his execution this month , @entity4 directed a message at @entity5 prime minister @entity16 , saying , " you entered voluntarily into a coalition with the @entity19 against the @entity20 , just as your predecessor , @entity3 , did , following a trend amongst our @entity5 prime ministers who ca n't find the courage to say no to the @entity19			1
" it 's not clear whether @entity4 ' comments were voluntary or were coerced by his captors			0
in his sunday interview , @entity3 said he felt president @entity32 is " absolutely right to take on @entity9 and build the broadest possible coalition			1
" he said , however , that aerial campaigns wo n't be enough and @entity9 will need to be fought " on the ground , " but it 's unclear whether the @entity38 and @entity39 fighters already battling @entity9 will be sufficient or if they 'll need to be supplemented			1
he did not specify who might need to provide troops , saying the plan to battle the terrorist group will " evolve over time			0
" asked why some @entity5 citizens had opted to join @entity9 , @entity3 said it was n't just a @entity5 problem but a @entity48 one			1
he also emphasized that the ideology espoused by those who fight alongside @entity9 is abhorrent to most @entity51			2
" the broad mass of the @entity51 community in the @entity5 will be absolutely horrified and appalled by this and condemn it completely , " he said			0
" the way these hostages are abused and subject to the grotesque form of public parade and then execution , it 's just horrific			0
it 's evil and it 's totally contrary to the principles of any form of religious faith			0
" britons who adhere to this ideology have been subjected to a perversion of @entity69 that must be stamped out not only in @entity5 , but in the @entity70 and @entity71 , @entity3 said			1
it was a familiar tack for the former prime minister , who said in an april speech that it was absurd that the @entity5 spends billions on defense to protect itself from " the consequences of an ideology " that is being taught formally and informally in countries " with whom we have intimate security and defense relationships			0
" at that time , @entity3 suggested raising the level of international dialogue to force countries to effect changes within their own societies			0
it 's not solely about the horrendous death toll from " religiously inspired conflict , " he said , but " quite apart from the actual loss of life , there is the loss of life opportunities for parts of the population mired in backward thinking and reactionary attitudes , especially towards girls			0
" in sunday 's interview , @entity3 said @entity5 were not joining @entity9 because they 'd been mistreated in the @entity5 but because they 'd been exposed to this radical ideology			1
" it 's an ideology based in a complete perversion of the proper faith of @entity69 , but it is powerful			2
it is proselytized and preached by people in mosques and madrasas not just in countries like @entity114 and parts of the @entity70 and parts of @entity71 , but back in parts of @entity5 , " he said			1
" how do you root this kind of teaching out and make it absolutely clear that it is completely unacceptable to teach these forms of extremism ? " he asked			0
@entity3 did not expand his remarks on @entity4 or offer thoughts on aid worker @entity126 , who appeared in the video of @entity4 ' execution , but he said @entity9 ' treatment of its hostages shows why it 's so important to win the fight against the group			1
the recent broadcast of executions demonstrates " how completely divorced from any type of proper human compassion these people are , and why it 's also necessary to take them on and beat them			0
" terrorist attacks span @entity140 and @entity141 , he said , citing incidents in @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 , and thus require a " global response " rather than a response only from the @entity141 or the @entity141 and a few @entity153 states			2
even countries like @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 can find common ground with the @entity19 on dealing with the threat , @entity3 said , adding that cooperating with @entity155 to battle extremism should not " impinge on how we view @entity155 attitude toward @entity162			2

hearing his name in execution video strengthened @entity3 's resolve to defeat @entity9 , he says
*ex-prime* minister says @entity32 " absolutely right " to build coalition , fight terror group
@entity3 : aerial campaigns wo n't be enough ; it 's unclear if fight will require more troops on ground
@entity141 must root out " perversion " of faith taught in @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity48 , he says
