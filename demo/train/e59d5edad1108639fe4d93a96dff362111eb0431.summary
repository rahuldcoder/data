-- @entity1 is living proof that there is no one road to terrorism			1
@entity7 officials believe the journey for @entity9 -- one of 14 @entity7 - born and naturalized citizens to be indicted last week on charges of conspiring with a @entity14 terrorist organization affiliated with @entity15 -- took him from a small town in @entity17 to a radical command role in @entity14			1
@entity1 was a late convert to @entity19 , becoming passionate about his father 's faith during high school in @entity17			1
he was born in @entity23 , a small town nestled in the bible belt where @entity19 was not only uncommon , but rebuffed			1
his hijab and public prayer made @entity1 a target for insults in the conservative community			1
he dropped out of the @entity30 in 2002 , moving to @entity31 , @entity32 , and then to @entity33 , @entity34 , as he searched in vain for a setting where @entity19 was practiced as rigidly as he believed it should be it is possible that @entity39 -- a correspondent for @entity41 's documentary series , " @entity42 " -- once brushed arms with @entity1			1
@entity39 was finishing a story in @entity14 in 2006 as @entity1 entered the country to seek out @entity46			1
@entity39 later created a documentary that retraces @entity1 's steps from young @entity7 to " @entity49			1
" " @entity49 " culminates in @entity14 , where @entity1 joined the ranks of @entity46 , or " @entity51			1
" @entity1 is a top commander of @entity46 and the organization 's most successful recruiter , @entity39 says			1
since he appeared on the @entity55 and the @entity57 website in 2007 , more than 30 young @entity54 have disappeared from @entity1 's old stomping grounds in the @entity7 and @entity32 , only to reappear fighting with @entity46			1
" @entity1 is making jihad look like a camping trip with weapons			1
you do n't see the brutality of war			2
you see guys who look really cool , and they look like they are taking their religion really seriously , " @entity39 says			2
although he alone is effective , @entity1 is not the only @entity7 jihadi on the @entity69			1
born in @entity71 and wanted by the @entity72 , @entity70 has been using social media sites to spread his lectures to larger audiences			2
according to @entity39 , these videos address @entity78 youths in terms they understand , using both @entity80 and modern slang			2
" what is pretty clear is that groups like @entity46 or @entity15 are in a war for the hearts and minds of young @entity54 in the @entity7 they are telling them that they 're not wanted here ... and that by living here , they 're a traitor , " @entity39 says			1
to @entity92 , this narrative is strikingly familiar			2
he is a cult counselor , mind - control expert and former follower of the rev. @entity95 and his " moonies			2
" it is @entity92 's belief that a terrorist organization is little more than a cult with a strong violent streak			2
" there are totalitarian mind - control cults that use deception and manipulation to get people in , and then indoctrinate people with new identities -- which are dependent and obedient on their superiors -- that often cause a divorce from their past identities and refutation of family and friends , " @entity92 says			2
drawing upon more than 30 years of personal and professional experience , @entity92 says indoctrination is dependent upon timing and social influence , not personal weakness or an intrinsic character flaw			2
" people from the outside looking in try to find all kinds of theories and justifications ... but speaking from the inside - out in terms of my own personal experience , i would have flown a plane into the @entity132 if i had been ordered to			2
but i did not join a group to blow up people			2
i wanted to make the world a better place , and i wanted to make the world filled with @entity138 , " @entity92 says			0
it is that ideology in radical @entity19 that @entity140 sees as the greatest draw for young @entity142			1
@entity140 is the civil rights outreach director for the @entity144 -- and a muslim			0
" this is not just some poor victim who , because he was unable to make it in life , became a terrorist			0
one of the allures of radical @entity153 ideology is it gives a person a purpose for their life , an evil purpose i would say , but nonetheless , they are fighting for something , " @entity140 says			0
as a child growing up in @entity165 , @entity140 's first brush with terrorism occurred when he witnessed car bombs set off by @entity153 extremists			1
he observed @entity153 operatives recruiting in schools and says it was n't uncommon to walk past someone considered a terrorist by the @entity7 due to their @entity175 appearance , @entity140 and a friend were falsely held by the @entity72 following the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			1
racial profiling has compelled many @entity54 to hide their roots and suppress their religion			0
according to @entity140 , a lack of identity and leadership within the @entity145 community has prompted some youths to combat the temperance that surrounds them			0
" these young @entity54 in @entity7 are looking for answers , are looking for ways to deal with that aspect of their identity , " @entity140 says			1
" some decide to erase it , some decide to explore it and express it			0
the problem is the message that is most available to them is not one you want them to hear			0
" @entity201 is the founder of the @entity202 , a research group that studies @entity19 terrorism worldwide			1
he says governments are mistaken in " reaching out to certain @entity153 groups that still push the narrative that the @entity7 is at war with @entity19 and that refuse to condemn @entity208 or @entity209			1
" " the @entity153 narrative is that there is a conspiracy against @entity19 , waged by the @entity142 and led by the @entity7 , and this alleged ' conspiracy ' is to suppress @entity19 , " @entity201 says			1
" radical leaders will all say and repeat a litany of crimes against @entity54 by the @entity142 , going as far back as the crusades in 1095			0
therefore , these @entity153 terrorist acts are perceived to be defensive reactions to defend @entity19			0
" @entity201 's organization works closely with the @entity72 to share information and prevent future terrorist attacks			0
@entity223 is the senior fellow at @entity224 -- a global consulting firm -- and former chief of the domestic terrorism and counterterrorism planning section in the @entity72			1
his work included investigating terrorists within the @entity7			1
" we conducted investigations into terrorist activities based on what we were authorized to do , " @entity223 says			0
" we would ... determine what sort of group they might be affiliated , who they were in contact with in the @entity7 or abroad and essentially what kind of activities they might be engaged in			1
that could be as simple as collecting money and sending it back to folks , or as complex as engaging in planning and conducting terrorist attacks			0
" @entity223 says that since 9/11 , intelligence and law enforcement communities have been successful in averting terrorist attacks of that magnitude , but that is n't to say it will never happen again			0
" the intelligence has to be right every time , but the terrorists only have to be right once to carry out a significant attack , " @entity223 says			0
to carry out attacks , @entity201 says , @entity153 groups deliberately try to alienate @entity145 populations from any loyalty to the host country , and thereby to have leverage over that country			2
" if you look at the @entity266 continent , there 's been a lot of immigration by @entity269 and @entity270 , " @entity201 says			0
" they are not the ones who are carrying out terrorist attacks			0
there is something else going on in the @entity145 communities			0
" @entity278 , head of the outreach and training unit for the @entity281 -- which calls itself the world 's first counterterrorism think tank -- says there are ways to prevent this alienation of @entity145 youth			0
" western societies need to strengthen civic identity and make all members of society feel like they belong , " @entity278 says			0
" they need to treat @entity54 as citizens and not as homogeneous blocs or groups with monolithic interests			1
" as a cult expert , @entity92 suggests offering radicalized youth the same treatment he offers his clients			0
he says the universal way to free someone from a cult 's clutch is to dissipate their phobias that by leaving , they are betraying @entity138 or @entity307			0
" a lot of people get into these groups following a dream or following an ideal			2
if people can see that the dream is not going to be a part of this group movement , that would help somebody reevaluate , " @entity92 says			0
@entity140 , meanwhile , says that while the support of the @entity142 is necessary , " to a larger extent , this is a @entity145 problem that only @entity54 can solve			0
" he says his moral compass ultimately led him down a path very different from some young @entity54 in the world today			2
" i am an outspoken critic of some of the most extreme and intolerant elements within @entity19 society , but at the same time , i am proud of my @entity19 heritage and @entity145 culture			0
" those things are not in contradiction in my mind			0
the supreme irony of this story is that i ca n't be any more @entity145 that i can be in @entity7			1
if we @entity54 were not living in a free society , we could not take a stand against extremism and reclaim our heritage			0

@entity1 went from a small town in @entity17 to a command role in @entity14
