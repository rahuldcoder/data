-- the @entity1 in @entity2 has an unlikely backer -- @entity4			1
despite being stuck in @entity2 for two years in an ordeal that he says left him contemplating a hunger strike and suicide , the freed footballer insists the @entity10 nation deserves to stage arguably the world 's top sporting event			1
world governing body @entity14 's decision to award the 2022 contest to @entity2 three years ago has generated controversy both over what time of the year it will be held and the way migrant workers , largely responsible for the tournament 's infrastructure , are treated			1
" they deserve it , " the @entity23 - @entity22 told @entity0 on friday			0
the " people are working very hard for it			1
a lot of @entity2 friends were sad at my situation			1
" i enjoyed my time there			0
the people who tried to destroy my life , i will not forgive them , but i will forever cherish the people who helped me			2
my life in @entity2 was great , but the last two years were a disaster			1
" a relieved and exhausted @entity38 , who was embroiled in a pay dispute with club @entity41 , returned home to @entity43 on thursday with his wife and two daughters after the 33 - year - old was finally granted an exit visa			1
but instead of saying @entity2 should be stripped of holding the @entity1 because of its controversial employment laws -- especially the kafala system , which effectively means foreign employees ca n't leave the country without their employer 's permission -- @entity38 indeed backed the emirate 's right to host the competition			1
an @entity59 report released last week claimed the abuse of migrant workers in @entity2 was an issue and even @entity63 has described working conditions there as " unacceptable " -- although the @entity14 president is adamant the @entity1 in nine years wo n't be moved to another country			1
" @entity1 organizers were sad " about his predicament , said @entity4			1
" i ca n't say bad things against @entity2 or @entity2 , just against the club , " he added in reference to his dispute with @entity41			1
as well as endorsing @entity2 as @entity1 host , @entity4 said there was little wrong with the employment laws in place -- as long as they were correctly followed			1
" there are rules ... if people respect them , everything will be fine , " he said			2
" i believe @entity2 will grow up in a very good way			1
i do n't think i helped them to grow			0
now we know that there are a lot of people that are abused			0
" it 's not the state of @entity2 or the government			2
there is a company that brings the workers			0
the company has to respect the rules			0
i 'm sad to see the workers abused , but it 's not the organizers or the government			0
" @entity4 , a striker , credited his wife for being " stronger " than him during his nightmare when he admitted to crying " every day , like a baby			2
" as @entity4 ' fight to leave @entity2 is over , so it also seems , is his playing career			1
" i think it 's finished for me , " he said			0
" i think a team , as a symbolic thing , they ( might ) want me to train for them			0
my psychology is very bad right now			2
" i did n't take any medication but i will see if i have the power to train			0
the fight was so intense			0
" the last few months might have made belounis a cause celebre , but he believes he wo n't be headline news for very much longer			0
" in one or two weeks , everyone will forget about me , " he said			0
" i have to focus on my life , have a normal life , find a job , to restart my life and enjoy my family			0
" the @entity2 @entity123 and @entity2 @entity124 ( @entity125 ) did n't reply to @entity0 's queries earlier this week seeking comment			1
but in october , the @entity125 told @entity0 that " as in any other football association in the world , there will unfortunately always be contractual disputes between clubs and players / coaches			0
" it added : " it is also relevant to emphasize that up to now the player has not taken any action in front of the competent judicial bodies of @entity14			0
" the @entity125 said further that @entity38 received full compensation in relation to a claim he made for compensation from another club , @entity147			2
" however , in the alleged case of @entity149 , @entity4 did not contact @entity125 , although he had experienced the efficiency of doing so when his request was legitimate , " it said .			2

@entity4 says @entity2 deserves to host the @entity1 in 2022
@entity4 was stuck in @entity2 for two years over a pay dispute but returned to @entity155 this week
he says the people in @entity2 are " working very hard " to stage the tournament
@entity38 *suspects* that his playing career is over as his " psychology is very bad "
