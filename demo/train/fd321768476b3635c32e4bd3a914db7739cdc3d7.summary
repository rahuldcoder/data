-- @entity1 moved up to third in the @entity2 as @entity3 helped welcome manager @entity4 back to the dugout with both goals in monday 's 2 - 0 win against @entity8			1
@entity4 had minor heart surgery three weeks ago , but returned earlier than expected to see his side edge above @entity12 rivals @entity11 and @entity13 on goal difference			1
@entity1 now trail @entity15 by four points and @entity17 by nine , with a game in hand on both teams			0
the victory extended @entity1 ' unbeaten league run to nine matches following two early defeats to the @entity26 sides -- the club 's best showing in the opening 11 games since the 1967 - 68 season			2
" i enjoyed the way we played tonight , i think the fans enjoyed it as well -- they 've seen lots of great teams over the years and they 're enjoying the way this team 's playing , " @entity4 said			2
" it 's great to be back tonight - i would n't want to watch it at home again , that was nerve - wracking			0
" @entity3 's brace at @entity46 represented his first goals for @entity1 since a double against @entity49 in his second league appearance for the club on september 18			1
@entity52 had netted in five successive games after that before missing the win over @entity56 , and the @entity58 's return from a hamstring injury gave @entity1 too much potency for a @entity8 side which included former @entity1 fullback @entity62 in right midfield to combat the threat of @entity65			1
but manager @entity67 's ploy failed to pay off as @entity69 winger @entity65 caused constant problems , and it was from his scuffed shot after @entity8 failed to clear a corner that @entity3 acrobatically hooked home the 13th - minute opener			1
the on - loan @entity17 forward , who made his international return for @entity78 last week , doubled the lead five minutes before the break when he forced in from close range after @entity8 defender @entity82 failed to cut out @entity65 's teasing near - post cross			2
@entity3 should have completed a hat - trick in the second half but @entity1 could not convert their continued dominance into more goals			2
@entity4 was able to bring off @entity52 with 20 minutes to play , allowing striker @entity90 a chance to impress ahead of saturday 's trip to @entity92			0
@entity8 stayed eighth on 15 points after 12 games , but have yet to win away in the league this season after four draws and two defeats			0
meanwhile , @entity11 manager @entity99 earlier insisted that his job is safe despite sunday 's 2 - 1 defeat by @entity49 , the club 's third in four league games			1
the 33 - year - old former @entity106 coach said his relationship with billionaire owner @entity108 was still good			0
" he did n't pay 15 million euros ( $ 20 million ) to get me out of @entity106 and another fortune to get me out of @entity11 , " he said			0
" it is not a question of the owner having patience			0
i have said we have set out to build something new at this club and the club is committed to what we are building for the future			0
" @entity121 moved up to fifth in @entity122 with a 3 - 1 victory away to struggling @entity124 on monday			1
@entity124 dropped to the bottom on goal difference below @entity127 and @entity128 , whose match against @entity131 on sunday was called off when a linesman was hit by an object thrown from the crowd			1
visiting @entity121 broke the deadlock three minutes after halftime through teenage midfielder @entity137 , and a 66th - minute own - goal by @entity139 doubled the lead			2
@entity141 gave @entity124 hope four minutes later , but veteran @entity58 substitute @entity143 set up @entity145 forward @entity144 for a late volley .			0
