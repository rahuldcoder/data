and @entity10 's @entity0 column , " i 'm a @entity11 and i hate terrorism , " which seems sadly necessary in the wake of @entity14			1
the opening of a presidential library is supposed to be a time for national unity			2
all the living presidents attend , standing together for a photo op and offering complimentary speeches about the newest inductee to the ex-presidents ' club			2
but during all the same pageantry in @entity25 at the opening of @entity5 's library , a less civil debate on the @entity3 ( and across the country ) was going on about 43 's legacy			1
@entity31 is a proud @entity5 administration alumna and attended the opening in @entity25			1
@entity10 , it is fair to say , is not a @entity5 fan			1
and so the debate raged , with @entity31 citing his investment in foreign aid to stem the tide of @entity40 in @entity41 and keeping the nation safe from terrorism after the attacks of 9/11			1
@entity10 acknowledged that @entity5 might be a nice guy to hang out with but asked whether the library would consist primarily of coloring books			1
as the card - carrying centrist in the group , i try to find common ground			2
at the time of our discussions , the sequester cuts were kicking in , and airline travelers were feeling the pain , with 40 % of flights delayed this week because of the furlough of air - traffic controllers			0
@entity61 has since overwhelmingly approved a measure to get the air travel system up to speed again after the delays provoked a round of the blame game on @entity67 , with conservatives accusing the president of " playing politics " with these particular cuts			2
@entity31 agreed with this assessment			1
i ai n't buying it			0
the sequester was supposed to be so dumb and painful that it would compel @entity61 to reason together and find deficit and debt reduction to more strategic means			0
and while the rhetoric of cutting government spending is popular , the reality is predictably less so			0
and so we 're being treated to the absurdity of conservative activist groups such as @entity85 -- whose sole purpose is to argue for cuts in government spending -- complaining about the practical effects of those very cuts on which they insisted			0
this is the old dynamic we see too much of -- cuts for thee but not for me			0
finally , in the wake of the @entity14 terror attacks , @entity99 and the @entity100 have navigated the tricky territory of confronting the ideology of radical @entity103 that apparently inspired the attacks without engaging in group blame			0
@entity10 's excellent @entity0 column tries to clarify some of the bigoted myths by making the point that @entity99 @entity11 might hate jihadis even more than typical @entity99 do because the murderers claim to represent their faith and cause a massive backlash against this growing @entity99 community			1
read the column -- and then listen to our conversation , tackling subjects such as why extremists of other faiths tend not to blow things up .			0
