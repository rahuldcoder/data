his training included an explanation about " no - go " areas , spaces for animals where people are not supposed to go			0
witnesses to the attack said that @entity13 went into a no - go area because he seemed to want to remove a stone close to one of the animals that could have been picked up and thrown around , @entity27 told @entity0			1
@entity13 crossed one barrier and approached a second one , which is a main fence with 24 strands of electrical wiring , @entity27 said			1
two male chimps grabbed @entity13 and tried to drag him under the fence , but were not able to yank him into their enclosure			1
@entity51 killed by wolves in @entity53 @entity27 said he estimates the attack lasted 15 minutes			0
at some point , people tried to stop the chimps , and @entity58 shot two rounds in the air to see if that might get them to retreat , he said			2
one of the chimps then charged at @entity58 , he said			2
cussons shot that chimp in the abdomen , he told @entity0 , and it seemed to shriek as a kind of signal to other chimps that there was a more powerful threat present			2
the chimps then backed off , he said			2
@entity13 was rescued and transported for medical care			1
none of the 13 tourists , most of them from local areas , were harmed , officials said			0

many of the primates have suffered " horrible injuries and abuse from humans , " according to the sanctuary			2
@entity119 , head of animal behavior at @entity121 , said that violence in chimpanzees is not at all unusual			0
" chimpanzees are known to be violent , and they can kill other animals			0
and male chimpanzees are particularly strong , " he said			0
@entity128 , an expert in large predators for @entity91 , said abused and captive chimpanzees can be particularly dangerous , likening the chimps to troubled prison inmates			0
" now this is a very nice prison , but it 's a prison nonetheless , " he said monday			0
" and that 's why you can see a lot of acting out behavior , and in some cases , with chimpanzees , they act out just because they can			0
" @entity13 was passionate about studying chimpanzees , his friend @entity143 told @entity0 affiliate @entity145			1
he said it was " intriguing " to listen to @entity13 when he spoke about the animals			2
