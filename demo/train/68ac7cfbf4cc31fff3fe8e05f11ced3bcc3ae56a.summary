-- the expensive casinos of @entity2 look crowded			1
tickets to the popular shows sell out			0
to the tourist , things look back to normal			1
yet as the state 's junior @entity12 senator lamented in february , " i can tell you right now @entity9 is nowhere close to a normal economy			1
" @entity9 's unemployment remains the second - highest in the nation , nearly 9 %			1
the housing market there still languishes			2
new federal reserve chair @entity18 acknowledged to @entity9 @entity19 sen. @entity19 that full recovery for @entity9 glimmers " years away			1
" @entity9 's troubles are more than a local concern			1
they reveal something important about the condition of the whole @entity12 economy			2
@entity9 makes its living from tourism , the state 's most important industry , and the tourists come -- or came -- for the casinos			1
before 1990 , the state of @entity9 and @entity35 , @entity36 , enjoyed something close to a monopoly on the casino industry			1
as more states legalized casinos , the @entity9 casino industry -- and especially the @entity2 industry -- responded by moving up - market			1
dazzling theme hotels housed lavish theatrical shows and outstanding restaurants			2
@entity2 , once a rather seedy place , repositioned itself as a center of glamorous entertainment			1
building the new hotels generated jobs			0
the people who worked in the hotels needed places to live , and building those homes generated more jobs			0
all that construction shaped an unusual local economy : here was a state with low average educational attainments ( only about 22 % of @entity62 have a college degree , 45th in the nation ) , yet a median income higher than the national average			1
@entity9 's blue - collar prosperity was built on a faulty premise			1
all those glitzy @entity2 hotels and resorts , containing typically up to 5,000 rooms each , depended on a huge influx of high - spending visitors			1
so long as homeowners could pay for vacations with some of the proceeds of their home refinancings , all was well			0
but when the refi boom stopped , @entity2 suddenly discovered it had built a destination too expensive for its customer base			1
everything else going on in the city -- the jobs in the hotels , the homes for the people who worked in the hotels , the malls where those people shopped , the homes for the people who worked in the malls -- all that crashed around @entity2 ' ears			1
and now , six years after the crash , it 's hard to see a way forward from the disaster			0
nationwide , the casino industry has more or less recovered from the recession			2
@entity12 left behind $ 37.34 billion in casinos in 2012 , only a shade below the 2007 peak of $ 37.52 billion			0
but they are spending that money in casinos closer to home			0
gross revenues of @entity9 casinos languish 20 % below their 2007 peaks			1
because of the higher cost of @entity2 - style amenities , a 20 % drop in revenues translates into a 50 % drop in profitability			2
so even as the industry nears recovery , the promise of a middle - class economy supported by gambling revenues has proven a mirage			0
casino employment dropped in @entity9 between 2012 and 2013			2
these were the best casino jobs in the country , which explains why total national casino wages lag 7 % behind the 2007 peak even as industry revenues have nearly caught up to the 2007 level			0
nor is there much likelihood of any early return to the old ways			0
@entity12 have grown cautious about gambling			0
while only about 14 % of @entity12 express a consistent moral disapproval of gambling , according to industry surveys , there has been a sharp increase in the proportion who reject gambling for themselves personally : 27 % in 2004 , 38 % today			0
unsurprisingly , 2008 was the year of the biggest change of national mind on this subject			0
meanwhile , those who do gamble are gambling in new ways that do n't support the style of industry for which @entity2 is famous			2
younger gamblers are attracted to online forms of gambling , which create jobs only for computer programmers			0
older gamblers increasingly prefer bare - bones casinos that offer free transportation and cheaper meals			0
@entity2 ' opulent palaces for the affluent gambler seem increasingly unsupportable in a country where more and more people have less and less disposable income			2
that 's a social trend that should concern us all , however we feel about this particular pastime .			0

@entity9 senator says his state is " nowhere close to a normal economy "
