@entity0 , @entity1 -- the flag of @entity1 , skeletons and the @entity5 are just some of the images evoked by a group of artists to give life to their views on @entity1 's new immigration law			1
the collection of prints , sculptures , paintings and photographs are featured in the traveling exhibit , " @entity18 : an artist 's @entity20 , " which opened at the @entity22 in @entity0 the weekend before the law took effect on july 29			1
the show will move to galleries throughout @entity1 and across the country in an effort to educate the public on how artists from the state that has become ground zero in the immigration debate perceive the matter , said the show 's organizer			1
" this educational exhibit was born from the thought that there has to be a different way of reaching people 's hearts on this issue , " said @entity36 , founder and ceo of @entity38 , which organized the exhibit in collaboration with the cultural center			1
" this show is not a protest show , " she said			0
" this was truly meant to be something that evokes people 's emotions , that allows you to work your way into the art and really consider what 's going on			2
" the show took shape quickly after its conceptualization in a marketing meeting in early june			0
a call to artists in @entity1 for contributions was quickly met with more submissions than the show could hold , prompting its organizers to rotate pieces each time the show moves to a new space			1
in their works , the artists bring their personal history and experiences with immigration in @entity1 -- a divisive issue in the border state long before @entity18 brought it under the national microscope			1
" my mother was undocumented , my father born in @entity90 , and she feared immigration all her life , even after she became a citizen , " said @entity80 , whose painting , born in the @entity82 , depicts the wake of a son of a @entity86 - born wife and @entity82 husband			2
" she never went back to @entity86 , and that same scenario has played over thousands of times			0
even today , my son is in the same situation			0
he is a citizen and my daughter - in - law is undocumented			2
history repeats itself , " he said			0
@entity80 describes his piece as " a portrait of a family sharing two cultures , " with the father in his @entity105 uniform , and the mother in traditional @entity86 garb , lighting a candle of the @entity109			0
" the piece tries to address that many couples have a foot in two worlds , " he said , " and that has n't changed in my lifetime			0
