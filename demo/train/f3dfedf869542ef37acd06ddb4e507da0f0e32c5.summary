the @entity0 has said his piece and personally made his position clear			1
in a much - trailed speech in @entity6 at a reception at the @entity8 the resilient royal " reiterated and reaffirmed " the categorical denials made by @entity11 issued on his behalf over accusations that he was repeatedly intimate with an alleged underage " sex slave			1
" @entity0 , still fifth in line to the @entity18 throne and @entity19 's second son , carefully and wisely avoided mentioning the name @entity21 ( @entity22 3 in filed @entity24 court papers ) -- the woman at the center of the sordid claims			1
he also did not repeat the specific allegations made against him			2
for the record those allegations are that @entity31 , now 31 , was " trafficked " to be used as an underage prostitute and was forced to sexually " service " the prince -- who she knew as " @entity35 " -- by her wealthy boss financier , and convicted sex offender , @entity38			1
she says she was 17 - years old at the time of her first encounter with prince @entity0 , which is under the legal age of consent in @entity43			1
she claims in court papers that @entity0 's @entity46 protection officers left her alone with him the first time he had sex with her and that she was later involved in an orgy with the @entity0 and approximately eight other girls			1
five photos were also submitted , including one which miss @entity21 said showed her aged 15 , when she says she began working as a " sex slave " for @entity38			1
she insists she is telling the truth and wants prince @entity0 to repeat his denials on oath			1
in his " for the record " speech , prince @entity0 stressed , " my focus is on my work			1
" it has prompted some to ask , " what exactly is it that the @entity0 does and what is the point of him ? " since his association with convicted sex offender financier @entity38 forced the @entity0 to accept a downgrading of his role as a @entity18 trade envoy in 2011 , he has been busy trying to carve out a new role for himself			1
he has continued to support business in the @entity18 -- but without a specialized role as before			2
in recent months many high ranking figures at @entity11 believed was on the right track and making progress in achieving that new role			1
i have witnessed personally what a good , no - nonsense communicator @entity0 is at events he has inspired and hosted			1
he is particularly passionate when dealing with young start - up entrepreneurs and bringing them together with successful businesses at networking and showcasing events			0
@entity0 is direct and to the point , and his methods seem to work			1
there is no doubt he is passionate about these issues and before this sex scandal blew up in his face he was making a good fist of it			2
as he said in his @entity6 speech -- but went widely unreported as his sound - bite about the sex allegations took all the attention : " i focus on inspiring young people to develop skills to enable them to become economically active , and encouraging a culture of enterprise and entrepreneurship			1
" his work focuses on supporting entrepreneurs			2
two of the important initiatives he has inspired are the @entity105 -- referred to as " @entity106 " -- which he is working with the @entity107 to deliver			0
this is about to engage and to inspire young people to get , not only digital skills , but enterprise skills , and to expand their knowledge in the digital universe			0
so far in year one , about 10,000 young people are engaged in the program			0
his second big project is @entity117 -- a bid to support start - up businesses			0
in 2014 the @entity0 launched @entity117 , and held two competitive pitch events at @entity121 , worked with 76 entrepreneurs from across the @entity18			1
each event was attended by around 400 invited investors , mentors and supporters			0
on the day # pitchatpalace was trending 4th in the @entity18 on @entity128			0
since then more than 700 connections made between the entrepreneurs and the audience			0
some results for the entrepreneurs featured include : financial wellbeing startup @entity134 , which has raised Â£ 500k ( $ 756k ) , hired four new employees , and received media coverage on @entity1 and other major media outlets			0
@entity0 argues passionately that entrepreneurs need more than just money ; they need business partners , they need mentorship , they need customers and they need network and of course investors			1
new role essentially , his new role is all about assisting the economic success of , and the creation of skilled jobs in , the @entity18			0
his efforts focus on three core areas where he believes he can have the greatest impact : education and skills , promoting apprenticeships as a desirable path to a career is one of his big issues			2
he is @entity161 and the @entity162 , among others			0
last year he visited 9 @entity164 , as well as 24 other educational projects or institutions , interacting with in excess of 5,000 students and learners			0
entrepreneurship is his second core focus -- encouraging entrepreneurship in the @entity18 , supporting current start - ups and efforts to develop a culture of enterprise			2
thirdly , supporting science technology and engineering , promoting expertise in these areas which attract investment into @entity18 and promoting the further translation of science into business			2
he has also been key in showcasing the work of the @entity18 @entity186 and @entity187			0
last month he hosted the @entity188 for @entity189 at @entity121 to celebrate the achievements of students in @entity164 ( @entity164 's ) across the @entity18			0
question of judgment there is no doubt this work is all highly commendable			0
but it is not his work life that is under scrutiny , but his judgment			0
but if prince @entity0 hopes his unprecedented move to speak out publicly about his private life will draw a line under the scandal he is mistaken			1
why ? because there are still simply too many unanswered questions about his role in the scandal engulfing him ; not least what was the nature of his relationship with @entity38 , a man convicted of procuring underage woman for prostitution , why did he visit him after he was released from prison and what was the nature of his association with @entity21 ( @entity22 3 ) who he was photographed with when she says she was a teenager			2
this combined with the fact the ongoing civil court case in the @entity24 against @entity38 and three women could just keep turning up new embarrassing allegations about the @entity0			1
however , it is important to remember the prince is not facing legal proceedings over the @entity24 claims			2
he has simply been named in court papers			0
he has not done anything illegal until someone proves he has			0
to date he has not been charged with anything either			0
it may be wiser for the media to show a measure of fairness and restraint when reporting allegations that are -- no matter how salacious and good copy -- after all just that , allegations			0
the only way , perhaps , @entity0 can hope to move on is by giving a detailed rebuttal of all the allegations that have been made against him in a sworn affidavit .			1

at @entity6 , prince @entity0 reiterated @entity11 denials over accusations of underage sex
@entity247 says the *spotlight* on the @entity0 has prompted to some to ask what he does
@entity247 says @entity0 focuses on entrepreneurship , education and technology
