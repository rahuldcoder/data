the handsome red and white wooden vessel , then christened @entity61 , carried out more than 100 rescue operations along the notoriously rough @entity63 and saved 45 people from drowning			0

boasting five dining lounges , two cocktail bars , a swimming pool , ballroom , squash court , and even a small hospital , the whopping 310 - meter cruise ship set a new benchmark in transatlantic travel when she was launched in 1936			0
during @entity96 , the historic vessel was stripped of her luxurious amenities and painted a camouflage gray as she transported more than 16,000 troops across the world			1
fast forward to today and the @entity84 has been restored to her former art deco glory , though her sailing days are long over			2
instead , guests can stay in one of 314 original staterooms and nine suites , in her permanent home in @entity109 , @entity110			2
we all live in a silver submarine history buffs can experience life as a @entity96 sailor -- without the combat -- aboard the historic @entity118 submarine			1
the mighty military vessel sank 23 @entity121 ships during the war , making her the third most prolific @entity32 submarine of the time			2
no longer patrolling key enemy shipping routes , today the @entity126 is moored in the @entity128 , @entity129			0

perched on top of @entity158 's @entity157 , this fantastical boat looks out over the city 's @entity159 , @entity161 and @entity162			1
a room for @entity158 is a one - bedroom installation intended to be a space for artists , writers and musicians , to stay for one night and create new works inspired by the great city rumbling beneath them			1
the building is based on the @entity173 , the riverboat that author @entity175 sailed up the @entity176 in 1889 , and later used as the inspiration behind his famous book @entity178			2
the modern reincarnation however , includes a crow 's nest , octagonal library and a cabinet of visual curios			0
" with its combination of painted wood and hand - worked gold and silver coated metals , it seems to echo the simplicity of a @entity121 tea - hut or the rural haphazard quality of a midwestern farm building , " said organizers .			2
