ho ho -- huh ? the family of an @entity4 in @entity5 says he 's crushed after a teacher questioned why he was wearing @entity8 garb during a school holiday dress - up day last week , @entity2 affiliate @entity1 reported			1
the teacher told @entity10 , a freshman at @entity11 , that he could n't be @entity8 because @entity8 is white , the student 's father , @entity8 , told @entity1			1
" he was embarrassed , " he told the station			0
now , his son does n't want anything to do with @entity16			0
@entity17 said the teacher called his wife to apologize , but that 's not enough			2
" he needs to be fired , " @entity10 told @entity1			1
" for him to make a comment like that , there has to be at a minimum prejudice in him , and we do n't have room for that			0
" @entity29 , the director of @entity30 , released a statement to media about the incident			0
" this situation involves a teacher recently hired by @entity11 who made -- and admits he made -- a stupid mistake , " the director said			0
" the remark was inappropriate and should not have been made			0
the teacher feels very badly about what occurred			0
he self - reported the incident to the principal and has apologized to the student and to the student 's parent			2
appropriate disciplinary action has been taken			0
" the boy 's family has asked that he be moved out of the teacher 's class , and the school has complied , @entity29 said			1
the teacher 's remark came amid something of a dust - up over @entity8 's skin color after @entity57 picked up on a @entity60 writer 's piece questioning the mythical character 's ethnicity			1
writer @entity63 , who is black , wrote about growing up wondering why @entity8 was depicted as a white man , and argued for something less definitive : a penguin			1
in a widely viewed segment reacting to @entity70 ' piece , @entity57 anchor @entity67 said on air : " and , by the way , for all of you kids watching at home , @entity8 just is white , but this person is arguing maybe we should also have a black @entity8			2
but , you know , @entity8 is what he is			2
and so , you know , we 're just debating this because someone wrote about it , kids			0
" @entity70 said @entity67 's comments are part of the reason she felt the need to provoke thought about @entity8 's race			1
" to me , ( it ) just spoke to the reason why i wrote the piece , is that there are a lot of people out there who automatically assume that @entity8 must be white and there 's no way -- it 's laughable that he could be anything else , " @entity70 said sunday on @entity2 's " @entity90			1
" " the point i was trying to make was that i think that we have , the world has changed a lot over the last 50 , 100 years , and @entity105 is a fictional character , " @entity70 continued			2
" he is nothing like the original historical figure he was based off of anymore , " she said			0
" we 've kind of evolved him into this magical mythical figure , and for kids , i think it 's important that they do n't have to feel necessarily bogged down that @entity8 is always white , and that 's the way he should be			1
" @entity67 shot back at her critics , telling them to get a sense of humor			0
" humor is what we try to bring to this show , but that 's lost on the humorless , " she said friday on " @entity116			0
" " this would be funny if it were not so telling about our society , in particular , the knee - jerk instinct by so many to race - bait and to assume the worst in people , especially people employed by the very powerful @entity57			0
" she was n't motivated by racial fear or loathing , she said			0
" in fact , it was something far less sinister : a lifetime of exposure to the very same commercials , mall casting calls , and movies @entity70 references in her piece			0
" " we continually see @entity141 as a white man in modern - day @entity143 , " @entity67 continued			1
" should that change ? well , that debate got lost because so many could n't get past the fact that i acknowledged , as @entity70 did , that the most commonly depicted image of @entity8 , does , in fact , have white skin			1
" former house speaker @entity152 , co-host of @entity2 's @entity153 , said a network makeup artist told him " @entity105 is what every child needs him to be , and the children get to decide @entity105 , not some tv commentator			2
" " i thought it was beautifully done , " @entity158 said			0
reality check at least all adults can agree on one fact : @entity105 is n't even real			0
so why the brouhaha ? @entity164 , president of the @entity165 , said the debate is " much ado about nothing " because there 's no doubt @entity8 is white			1
" ( @entity171 ) @entity141 was @entity172			1
the last time i checked , @entity172 were n't black , " @entity164 told @entity2 's @entity173 on the 11th hour			1
according to the @entity175 , which says it 's dedicated to " discovering the truth about @entity105 , " @entity141 was indeed @entity172 and lived about 1,700 years ago in an area that is now southern @entity178			1
but author @entity179 said he does n't think many @entity172 people would be accurately portrayed as the " rosy - cheeked @entity8 that we 're all used to			1
" " @entity181 has more to do with sociological , economic , cultural considerations that go far beyond just the simple color of your skin , " @entity179 told @entity173			0
@entity186 , anchor of " @entity187 " at @entity188 , acknowledged that most depictions of @entity8 feature a white man			2
but in addition to being fictional , " traditionally @entity8 has also been an obese , alcoholic elf who lives in the @entity193 , who has very questionable labor practices -- not to mention animal cruelty , lashing those poor reindeer through the sky all night long			1
" " this is ridiculous that we are even having this debate , " @entity186 said			0
" everyone knows that @entity8 is your parents			2
so whatever race they are is the race that @entity8 is			2
" opinion : @entity8 's color is n't the important thing			1

commentator : @entity8 's not just fictional , he 's also " an obese , alcoholic elf " with questionable labor practices
