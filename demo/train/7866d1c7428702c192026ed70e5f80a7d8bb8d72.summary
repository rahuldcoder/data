-- @entity0 's @entity1 has broken new ground by exposing the horrors of child labor , the shame of forced marriages , the brutality of child militias and the injustice of the routine everyday discrimination practised against millions of girls , denied even the most basic of education -- most blatantly revealed in the shooting by the @entity15 of @entity16			1
this year i foresee the @entity1 gaining new momentum as young people take to the streets and airwaves , grow more vociferous in championing their rights and prove that they are more assertive in seeking change than the adults tasked with their care			1
this week a global petition calling for justice for young women in @entity29 has attracted more than one million signatures , principally from young people , as a result of the campaigning energies of @entity34 , the global online petitioning movement			1
young men and women dominate this month 's countrywide anti-rape demonstrations , but all across @entity39 young people have hit the streets in record numbers at the start of the year			1
in @entity43 , young people are leading a movement to demand " child marriage - free zones " to end the practice of girls aged 10 , 11 and 12 being forced into loveless marriages against their will			1
i have met some of these brave girls who are proving more determined in standing up against child marriage than their parents			2
@entity55 : time for men to challenge treatment of women in @entity61 , days before @entity29 's anti-rape protests , young people were already marching , demanding an end to men 's violence against women and last week demonstrators voiced their outrage at a tense meeting with the prime minister			1
in @entity29 , another set of street demonstrations is also gaining ground			0
young people who have escaped , often when just eight or nine , from bonded labor , have been leading a march to end this form of child slavery , a march that the chief justice of @entity29 joined and endorsed			1
and in @entity79 ( also known as @entity79 ) , where @entity80 led demonstrations for democratic rights 25 years ago , 200,000 young people demonstrated against child trafficking			1
already in response to worldwide revulsion at violence against women , major demonstrations are being organized in @entity89 and @entity39 in february			0
these demonstrations build on the role played by young people in the @entity92 , the growth of an " indignant " youth movement in @entity94 and the student demonstrations about tuition fees and rights to study that have characterized countries as diverse as @entity100 and @entity101 , all of which have focused on the dearth of opportunities for young people			1
by the end of january , three million people will have signed the @entity16 petitions , calling for girls to be given their rightful opportunities to go to school			1
but what is most noteworthy is that one million of these signatures are being assembled by young @entity115 children who are denied a place in school			2
when i visited @entity115 recently , i was struck by the determination of schoolgirls @entity120 and @entity122 , friends of @entity16 who were also injured in the @entity15 attack			2
both girls determined , in spite of the dangers , to stand up to the intimidation , return to school and study to be doctors			0
dictating daughters ' destinies the same determination is displayed by @entity135 , a young @entity29 from @entity136 who wishes to return to school and train to become a teacher			0
promised a chance to send home money to his family , he was forced to work unpaid in a sweatshop for 14 hours a day			0
thankfully @entity135 was rescued by the @entity145			0
now his cause , and that of thousands of others like him , will lead to the presentation of a petition to the @entity29 parliament calling for the abolition of child labor			0
indeed it is expected that in advance of the @entity29 parliament 's vote on the issues , one million more mainly young people will add their names			1
the act of creating " child marriage - free zones " reminds us that even in 2013 patriarchs still attempt to dictate their daughters ' destinies			0
the zones also demonstrate patriarchy will not hold back girls ' aspirations forever			2
protests against male violence against women remind us that too many men still treat women as their chattels , to be exploited and brutalized , but the scale of protests illustrates that the men who are violating rights are being challenged			0
the demand from girls to go to school is also a reminder that for most of history , adult generations have been able to dictate whether the next generation is free to dream of better futures or not			0
now , girls are saying that their elders can no longer trample upon their rights			1
you do n't need to fall for a technological determinism to understand that the @entity194 is helping to radicalize a new generation of young people thanks to our new - found capacity to communicate instantaneously across continents			1
just as opinions during the @entity92 spread rapidly via new technologies , so young people in @entity39 are today communicating , exchanging views and learning more about other young people			1
they are making connections across old borders , breaking down traditional barriers , crossing ancient divides and smashing long - established walls of prejudice			0
' frightened ' @entity29 child bride annuls marriage in the 1960s @entity212 talked of crossing a new frontier			0
in 2013 , because of the advances of technology , young people are finding that there is no frontier			1
indeed the sheer scale of the anti-child slavery demonstration of 200,000 young people in @entity223 shows that regimes can repress for a time but they can not maintain their repression indefinitely			1
the marches against child trafficking show that the truth will eventually come out and the victims ' cries for help will not be silenced forever			0
it is not technology however that is driving young people 's concerns , it is the yawning gap between the promise of globalization and its reality that brings young people out on to the streets			1
the promise is that every young person has the chance to rise as far as their talents can take them			0
young people are , however , coming to understand the reality of globalization -- that their opportunities and rights depend more on where they were born and who they were born to than on their merit , their effort or their talent			1
it is this growing awareness of the gap between what you have in yourself to become -- and yet what you are -- that is fueling the demand for change			0
our task is to offer a pathway out of exploitation and into freedom , out of exclusion and into education			0
when as much as 80 % of global inequality is explained by birth and background , education should be the counterweight , the driver of equal opportunity			2
the case for global investment in basic education ( we need at least two million more teachers and four million classrooms ) is not just that individuals will benefit from educational opportunity but that countries will too			2
indeed , mobilizing the talent of young people is the only sure way of unlocking the potential of the poorest countries in the world			2
we spend 250 times more in the @entity296 schooling a child up to the age of 16 than we do on the average @entity89 child			0
our pattern of educational spending compounds rather than corrects or compensates for these glaring inequalities			0
annual educational aid is only $ 14 per @entity89 child			0
an april summit , led by @entity308 secretary - general @entity307 and @entity310 president @entity309 , will demand concrete action from off - track countries to move children from the violation of their basic rights to the guarantee of their right to education			2
in the coming year i hope the @entity308 will hold a debate in its @entity321 on systematic violations of children 's rights , demanding that , instead of the exploitation these young people suffer today , we open the doors to opportunity in education			1
my aim for 2013 and beyond is to move millions of children from the abyss of exploitation today into the opportunity of education tomorrow			2
this is the one way we can not only release children from abuse but break the cycle of poverty which is at risk of being transmitted from generation to generation .			0
