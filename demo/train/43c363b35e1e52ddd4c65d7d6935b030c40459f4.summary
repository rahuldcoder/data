@entity1 , @entity0 -- rival dissident army officers are claiming to lead the increasingly armed rebellion within @entity5 , exposing rifts within the opposition			1
in an interview by telephone with @entity2 , maj. @entity8 introduced himself as a spokesman for the " @entity12 , " a newly formed organization that now claimed to lead armed defectors within @entity5			1
" this council represents the people fighting in @entity5 , " @entity8 said			2
he added that the council was led by gen. @entity17 , an officer who defected from the @entity5 military			2
but @entity8 's claim was quickly rejected by another defecting officer , col. @entity20 , who spent much of the last year claiming to lead a " @entity23 " of rebel soldiers from a refugee camp on the @entity0 border with @entity5			1
" this man represents himself , " @entity20 said in reference to @entity17			2
" he has nothing to do with the @entity23 ... those people are representing themselves and do not represent the revolution and the @entity23			1
they do n't represent anybody			2
" @entity20 spoke to @entity2 by telephone from the @entity0 border region			0
" this is a conflict for leadership , which happens in all organizations and political parties , " explained a @entity0 diplomat , who spoke to @entity2 following diplomatic protocol on condition of anonymity			0
@entity41 seeks next step as deaths mount the diplomat confirmed that more than a month ago , @entity17 had come to the same refugee camp in @entity0 that housed @entity20			0
the diplomat added that the general had tried to assume command over the colonel			0
it is not clear how much command and control any of the exiled officers have over defecting troops and other armed opposition groups inside @entity5			1
but another former army officer based in @entity1 told @entity2 neither the @entity12 nor @entity20 's @entity23 represented a rebel faction currently battling government forces in the besieged city of @entity58			1
ancient city in the cross hairs " we are not working under the control of the @entity23 or the @entity12 , we are independent , " said lt. @entity61 , who claimed to represent the rebel " @entity62 " in @entity58 from his places of refuge in @entity1			1
during the more than 10 months since the uprising began in @entity5 , competing civilian exiles have also claimed leadership of the revolution			0
some @entity72 diplomats working closely with opposition groups have privately expressed frustration with dissidents ' lack of unity , even as the death toll continues to rise within @entity5			1
the human toll of unrest in @entity5 " a natural reaction for people who have been brutalized for so long is depression and grandiosity , " said @entity80 , author of " in the @entity81 " and a @entity5 specialist with the @entity83 of @entity84			0
" it is also confounded by the fact that @entity5 is made up of various sects and ethnicities			0
" @entity93 , a former @entity5 ambassador who now works out of the @entity1 offices of the opposition @entity95 , argued that after decades of dictatorship , party politics were still a new concept for many of his countrymen			2
" look at it like [ political ] parties being formed for the first time right now , " he said			0
" one day they will come together			0

various officers say they are the lead opposition
