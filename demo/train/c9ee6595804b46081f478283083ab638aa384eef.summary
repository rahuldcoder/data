-- the thing about @entity2 is that once in a while , it does something that sends the international community into a flurry of talk about the hermit nation , even though little is known about what 's really going on			1
this week , @entity10 fired a long - range @entity12 rocket and sent a satellite into orbit			2
nervous world leaders quivered as the rogue country defied a @entity18 ban on developing nuclear - and missile - related technology			0
was the world a more dangerous place after wednesday 's event ? what would it mean for @entity2 's young leader as he is about to mark the first anniversary of the death of his father , @entity28 ? when the son ascended to power , concerns surfaced over an inexperienced , mysterious heir taking charge of @entity2 's nuclear weapons program , its hardcore and cultish communist society and a population of the hungry			1
his eldest half brother said in his book that he was concerned @entity41 would fail to satisfy @entity2			1
now , the new " @entity28 " can claim not just a public relations victory but also a tangible accomplishment as he prepared for monday 's anniversary of @entity28 's death			1
amid the dearth of information , one thing was clear : @entity41 can now stand proud before his people on that big day			1
" the question is what does @entity41 intend ? said @entity52 , director of the @entity53 at the @entity54 in @entity55			1
" it 's been an interesting first year but as with most things in @entity2 , we simply do n't know , " he said			2
few nuclear experts saw the launch as a tremendous technological advancement , but the perceptions were great and gave @entity28 a big boost in clout			1
he can say he fulfilled a promise that has kept his family dynasty in power for decades ; that the nation 's persistence to move on -- despite international isolation and internal hardship -- has paid off			1
in that sense , the satellite launch was proof of progress and power , said @entity77 , the former @entity78 ambassador to the @entity18 who traveled to @entity2 in 2010			2
" he wants to show his people after one year in leadership , @entity2 is a strong military , technological , space , nuclear power ( with ) nuclear weapons , " @entity77 said			2
" i think that was partly to shore up the military , to shore up his support , " he said			2
@entity89 , a @entity2 specialist with the @entity90 , agreed			0
" i think this is very important to @entity41 to build political legitimacy and bolster the spirits of his people , " he said			1
" he is doing this despite the fact that he knows he is going to come into a lot of criticism in the region for it			0
" the launch was a continuation of @entity41 's father 's project and it was important to achieve success days ahead of the death anniversary , especially after a failed rocket launch in april			1
that launch had been timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of founding leader @entity111 , the grandfather of @entity41			1
" then , it was a major embarrassment , " said @entity112 , director of the @entity114 's @entity113 who was in @entity2 at the time of the failed launch			1
" so they tried to rectify that			0
" this is a tremendous psychological boost vis - a - vis the @entity122 , " @entity112 said referring to the fact that @entity122 has not yet put a satellite in space			0
@entity2 's ruling politburo is sure to spin the story as national dreams coming to fruition under the initiative of @entity28 , @entity112 said			1
sure enough , the state - run news agency @entity130 said the launch was " a desire at the behest " of @entity28			1
" all the people across the country are greatly excited at the news of the successful launch and progressives are extending sincere congratulations to them , " it said			1
the sentiment was echoed at a snow - dusted celebratory rally friday			0
" the successful launch was the result of @entity28 's " unique will , courage and boldness , " said @entity144			1
the rocket launch allows @entity28 to establish military security for @entity2 , said @entity112 , and allows him to move forward with another priority : economic progress			1
" this is an important game changer , " @entity112 said			0
@entity112 , who has been visiting @entity2 for decades , said conditions for ordinary @entity2 remain bleak , though there is not the mass starvation the country suffered in the 1990s			0
" @entity41 's primary objective is to improve the economy by participating in the international market , " @entity112 said			1
that 's a feat that is not possible without @entity78 cooperation			2
" so he realized he has to improve relations with the outside world , " @entity112 said			0
" in the big scheme of things , @entity41 must have thought that @entity2 would be taken more seriously ( after a rocket launch )			1
" @entity169 said @entity28 has been consolidating his power for some time by sacking unwanted people from his cabinet			1
" purge is too strong a word but there have been all sorts of changes , " @entity169 said			0
" that 's telling me that this guy is taking charge and setting up for economic policy changes			2
@entity41 staked his personal prestige on economic growth			1
" @entity169 warned that at the moment , there were no signs of any economic changes			2
@entity112 , however , said he could see some evidence of the @entity2 boosting agricultural production , building hydraulic power plants and other infrastructure and inviting foreign investors			0
the @entity193 , in particular , have taken advantage of that , @entity112 said			0
@entity169 agreed that @entity41 has shown signs that he wants to stimulate economic growth but the problem is that means he has to make a change from his father 's military - first policy that devoted billions of dollars into weapons development			1
" the question is does he have the political muscle and the political will to do that ? " @entity169 said			0
" he has certainly positioned himself to do that			2
" in the world 's most totalitarian state , it 's difficult to predict the future			2
but the rocket launch this week certainly cast the spotlight back on the enigmatic nation and served as a reminder to global powers that the @entity2 problem is n't just going to slither sway			1
" he 's saying to the world , ' look , i 'm back , ' " @entity77 said about @entity41			1
" you ca n't keep me off the headlines			0
i have to be dealt with			0
this is the capability i have			0
" @entity77 believes the main message this week has to be that the @entity78 and the four other countries that have been involved in talks with @entity2 -- @entity193 , @entity228 , @entity122 and @entity229 -- have to come up with a new approach in their dealings with @entity10			0
" these guys are serious ; they 've got missiles now , " @entity77 said			0
" it 's uncertain about the new leader , " he said			2
" i 'm disappointed , because i thought maybe there 's a positive political opening with him			2
" maybe there still is			0
@entity169 said the only way to get what @entity242 wants on the nuclear front is to come to the table			0
it 's also the only way to know more about @entity2			0
@entity169 likes to say that there is only one thing tougher than negotiating			0
and that 's not negotiating			0
@entity0 's @entity250 contributed to this report .			0
