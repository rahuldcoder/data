-- when he co-founded @entity3 , the world 's largest medicinal - cannabis dispensary , located in @entity6 , @entity7 , five years ago , @entity2 's goal was to provide a safe , comfortable , organized alternative to what he saw as a broken system in the state , professional thugs on one side , irresponsible stoners on the other			1
" both options were bad , " @entity2 said			1
" on one hand , it was just amateurish			0
on the other hand , it was still scary			0
... i wanted to put together a dispensary that would bring together the twin ideals of my life , which are a commitment to activism and a commitment to professionalism			2
" the roots of activism began early with @entity2 , who was a seventh grader in @entity31 when he organized a @entity33 - war protest in the form of a gymnasium takeover			1
by 16 , he was out of school completely ( " i was more equipped to educate myself than the teachers in high school were to teach me , " @entity2 said ) , and working as a street activist			1
over the years , he would busy himself as a record producer and talent booker in the music industry , graduate summa cum laude from the @entity45 and found a company called @entity47 , which sold hemp clothing and accessories all over the @entity50 and in 21 countries overseas			0
@entity2 said he was approached by half a dozen or more reality - television producers after opening @entity54 , but citing their needs to " create dramatic conflict and something sensational , " he refused to sign with any of them			1
but when @entity60 approached , he sensed a shared understanding , and @entity63 's " @entity62 " was born			1
@entity2 spoke with @entity0 about his upbringing , what his show has accomplished and what he wants from this year 's presidential election			1
@entity0 : were you really born at 4:20 p.m. ? @entity2 : i was really born at 4:20 p.m. it 's funny , i had n't even known that until a couple years ago when one of my staff was reorganizing my files and happened to come across my birth certificate			1
sure enough , it was 4:20 p.m. @entity0 : do you remember your first time smoking marijuana ? @entity2 : yes , i remember it vividly for sure			1
i went to a friend 's house after school , and i was ready for cannabis			1
i had heard about it and i had read about it			0
from the very beginning of my cannabis use , i was quite well educated			2
i probably read two or three books about cannabis before i even consumed any			2
my first experience was really revelatory for me			0
i had a little smoke at my friend 's house , and then walked home through a beautiful park that had this long creek			2
for the first time in my life , i really became aware of myself as a creature of nature that was related to other creatures of nature			0
i remember to this day how the sunlight was rippling down through the gaps and the leaves of the trees			0
@entity0 : why did you drop out of high school at 16 ? @entity2 : it was mainly politics			1
i had been getting into issues at school because i was politically active			0
i did n't feel that the school system was really educating me or preparing me to do the things i wanted to do in life then			0
i felt that the educational system offered me a very narrow slice of knowledge and required a great degree of conformity			0
i felt like i was being trained to become an obedient corporate drone , which was never something i wanted in my life			0
i dropped out of high school on my 16th birthday			0
when i was 17 - and - a - half years old , i took the ged and passed it with flying colors			2
so i actually had my high - school diploma prior to my compatriots that remained in high school			2
@entity0 : when were you approached by @entity63 about @entity54 ? @entity2 : about 13 months ago			1
what happened was , as the debate over @entity134			0
19 heated up , there was a lot of media interest in the issue of cannabis			2
we were approached by a series of producers of reality tv shows , about a half a dozen , maybe more			1
each one wanted us to be featured in a reality tv show , but i could tell they all had the agenda of a reality show , and i was concerned that we would not be portrayed as we really are , but in some sensationalistic kind of way			1
and then @entity60 came along , and i could tell from the first meeting with them that they had a different kind of intention , that they really did want to show us as we were , as we are			2
i checked out their past work that they had done , i interviewed some of the people that they had worked with , i spent a lot of time with them personally just to get to know them			0
when i became convinced that they were really truly committed to showing us and showing medical cannabis as it is , i decided i was comfortable doing the show with them			1
@entity0 : do you feel like you 've affected the cannabis law and public opinion with the show ? @entity2 : absolutely			1
i know we 've had a tremendously positive impact			2
we 've received hundreds of letters from people all over the country and were deeply moved by the show			2
so many people wanted a second season , they crashed the @entity184 page of the @entity63			1
i got letters from a retired cop in @entity187 who talked about how if it was 28 years earlier he would have arrested us , but now after seeing the show had his eyes opened and was thinking about checking it out and becoming a patient himself			2
we had a baptist minister from @entity195 call up my publicist and have my publicist on the phone praying for me and my brother because he was so moved by the show			2
@entity0 : you present your words carefully : " cannabis " instead of " marijuana , " " wellness " instead of " recreation			2
" why is that ? @entity2 : first of all , as to cannabis versus marijuana , marijuana was a term that was popularized by prohibitionists , specifically @entity212 , who had a huge media campaign in the 1930s , an ultimately successful campaign , to make cannabis illegal			1
and in that campaign , he wanted to identify cannabis with the other , the foreign , the @entity218			2
so there were all sorts of horror stories about @entity218 immigrants and african - americans going crazy after they ingested the " demon weed , marijuana , " which sounded very foreign to @entity50 ears , very exotic			0
so i think that as we move to a place where we 're leaving reefer madness behind and really taking a second , more scientific look at cannabis , it 's appropriate to use the scientific terminology for the plant			1
as for recreation , i do n't believe that very many people really , truly use cannabis for recreation -- or anybody , really			0
what is recreation ? recreation is not something you can smoke or something you can swallow or something you can rub on your skin			0
it 's not a commodity			0
@entity0 : who decided on the name of the show ? @entity2 : that was all a @entity63 decision as well			1
we had actually urged it to be called " @entity254			0
" but as it turned out , ( " @entity62 " ) was completely appropriate			1
when they first suggested the name to me , i was like , " what are you talking about ? we never call it ' weed ' and it 's not about a war			0
" when you look at the show , there 's not warfare going on in the show			1
except that , after filming was completed , we had the @entity272 administration reverse their policy on medical cannabis and the @entity275 in @entity7 , in fact , go to war against us			0
and episode two of " @entity62 " really spent a lot of time describing that struggle , so i think that , looking backwards , the choice of the show title was actually remarkably prescient			1
@entity0 : you bring up politics and i imagine the upcoming election has you approaching your fight in different ways			0
which candidate is most in line with your views ? @entity2 : i have not decided who i 'm going to vote for for president , but there 's two things that i know for sure : i 'm not going to vote for somebody that thinks i 'm a criminal and wants to put me in prison , and i will vote for the person who i 'm convinced will defend medicinal - cannabis patients			1
those are my two main metrics			0
i have n't decided who i 'm going to vote for yet , but i think that the president has endangered millions of votes that he would have otherwise gotten by allowing the @entity50 attorneys to conduct this campaign against cannabis			0
my preferred outcome would be that the president does the right thing , keeps his original promise to the medicinal - cannabis community , and ends this federal attack on patients			1
that would allow me to wholeheartedly support the president for re-election			0
that 's what i hope happens			0
@entity0 : what happens if you 're presented with two candidates who do n't meet your two characteristics ? @entity2 : i 'll be looking at the third parties			1
i will not vote for someone that wants to put me in prison .			0
