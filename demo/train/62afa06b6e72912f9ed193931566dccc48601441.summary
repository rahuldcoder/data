@entity0 -- president @entity2 announced monday that the @entity3 will resume using military commissions to prosecute alleged terrorists held at the @entity6 , @entity7 , detention facility			1
in the announcement , the president said his administration remains committed to closing the controversial detention facility but will rescind its previous suspension on bringing new charges before military commissions			2
the commissions are military proceedings rather than trials in civilian courts			1
@entity2 also called for prosecuting @entity6 detainees in @entity3 criminal courts when appropriate , and issued an executive order calling for periodic reviews of suspects held under indefinite detention			1
the steps followed through on @entity2 's previous call to reform the process of prosecuting or holding @entity6 detainees to make it more in line with international laws and standards , according to senior administration officials who briefed reporters on condition of not being identified by name			1
however , the @entity34 and the @entity35 both criticized the administration for what they called institutionalizing indefinite detention of terrorism suspects who have yet to be formally charged or designated for transfer to another country , but are considered too dangerous to set free			2
" the creation of a review process that will take up to a year -- designed to be repeated every four years -- is a tacit acknowledgment that the @entity2 administration intends to leave @entity6 as a scheme for unlawful detention without charge and trial for future presidents to clean up , despite the fact that senior officials acknowledged today that keeping the prison open continues to hinder our national security in the long run , " the constitutional rights center said in a statement			1
@entity61 rep. @entity60 of @entity62 also called the administration 's announcement disappointing , saying the @entity6 facility is a " blot " on @entity3 national honor			1
noting that @entity68 passed a law prohibiting the transfer of @entity6 detainees for trial in the @entity3 , @entity60 said that " as a result , the administration has turned to the legally dubious military commissions to try these suspects			1
" established in response to the september 11 , 2001 , terrorism attacks on the @entity3 , the @entity6 facility has been a lightning rod for criticism of the @entity3 handling of terrorism suspects			0
under the @entity91 administration , allegations of mistreatment of detainees , including harsh living conditions and denying them full @entity3 legal rights , led to the facility becoming a recruiting tool for terrorist groups such as @entity95 , @entity3 officials say			0
@entity2 previously pledged to close the @entity6 facility within a year of taking office in january 2009 , prompting criticism from conservatives			2
in addition , his administration has sought to prosecute some high - profile detainees -- such as alleged september 11 mastermind @entity102 -- in civilian courts on the @entity3 mainland , which drew widespread opposition that crossed traditional party lines			2
the @entity6 facility remains open today due to legal complexities involving the status of some detainees and congressional opposition to holding trials for high - profile suspects in @entity3 criminal courts			1
shortly after @entity2 's announcement monday , defense secretary @entity115 announced the withdrawal of his prior suspension of new charges before military commissions			1
@entity115 cited reforms of the military commissions under a 2009 law , and he and @entity125 chairman adm. @entity124 both expressed support for also using civilian courts to prosecute terrorism suspects			2
" for reasons of national security , we must have available to us all the tools that exist for preventing and combating international terrorist activity , and protecting our nation , " @entity115 ' statement said			0
" for years , our federal courts have proven to be a secure and effective means for bringing terrorists to justice			0
to completely foreclose this option is unwise and unnecessary			0
" congressional republicans -- including @entity143 minority leader @entity142 of @entity144 , @entity146 chairman @entity145 of @entity147 , @entity149 chairman @entity148 of @entity150 and @entity152 chairman @entity151 -- welcomed the renewal of military commissions			1
however , @entity148 and @entity156 chairman @entity155 of @entity157 criticized @entity2 for acting on his own instead of working out a policy with @entity68			2
@entity155 said he was " disappointed the @entity159 chose to put another @entity160 on this problem , rather than working with @entity68 to develop the comprehensive and long - term legislative framework we need			0
" @entity148 also questioned what the steps announced monday mean for high - profile detainees such as @entity102 and other september 11 conspirators			0
the senior administration officials refused to comment on any individual cases			0
they said they expected new charges against @entity6 detainees to be filed with military commissions soon , perhaps within days or weeks , and noted that the @entity2 administration had transferred 67 detainees to third countries so far , leaving a total of 172 in the facility			1
in addition , the senior administration officials said they would try to repeal the law that prevents the transfer of @entity6 detainees for trial in the @entity3			0
" military commissions should proceed in cases where it has been determined appropriate to do so , " the administration said in an information sheet issued monday			0
" because there are situations , however , in which our federal courts are a more appropriate forum for trying particular individuals , we will seek repeal of the restrictions imposed by @entity68 , so that we can move forward in the forum that is , in our judgment , most in line with our national security interests and the interests of justice			0
