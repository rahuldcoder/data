-- in the lodging world , green has gone mainstream			0
once chided for being wasteful , the big hotel chains are now constantly trying to one - up each other with smart eco-design upgrades and stringent water and energy conservation policies			1
@entity9 has begun recycling its own aluminum , plastics and paper in countries where such programs do n't exist			1
consider this fact : in a recent survey , 68 percent of @entity17 hotels said they had energy - efficient lights , and two thirds had implemented towel - and linen - reuse programs , up from just over half five years ago			1
the number of properties trying to become @entity26 ( @entity26 ) certified , the most recognized standard for building sustainability , is also on the rise : applications to the @entity17 @entity31 for the award spiked by 550 percent between 2006 and 2008			1
more than 500 hotels could soon earn the label ; until four years ago , only one had the designation			2
although all the major players are making strides toward better green policies , some are doing more than others			0
here 's what the leaders have achieved in four earth - changing categories : @entity45 replacing inefficient lighting , one energy - draining bulb at a time @entity49 : more than 8,600 @entity51 locations in at least a dozen states have been retrofitted with occupancy sensors that cause the thermostat to readjust when guests go out			1
@entity56 : a trial program has been rolled out at 650 hotels that aims to cut energy consumption by as much as 25 percent			1
if successful , it could be expanded to all of the chain 's 4,000 properties , including @entity63			2
marriott : over the past decade , 450,000 incandescent bulbs have been replaced with compact fluorescent ones , and more than 250 hotels ( including some @entity68 ) have earned an @entity70 efficiency label from the @entity17 @entity71			1
@entity72 : the new element brand 's goal is for every hotel to be leed certified			0
its first property , which opened last year in @entity78 , @entity79 , is fully loaded with @entity70 appliances , led lighting , and top - notch ventilation systems			2
all together , that saves enough energy annually to power 236 homes			2
water conservation tightening up on all the drips and drops in hotel bathrooms @entity91 : the company 's aim : to reduce water use at all of its brands , such as @entity91 , @entity96 , and @entity97 , by 10 percent by 2014			2
its nearly 90 @entity99 properties have taken the lead , installing water - saving toilets , showerheads , and faucets over the past three years			1
home - turf hotels are next			1
hyatt : nearly all @entity107 properties have " low - flow " showerheads ( which use a maximum of 2.5 gallons of water per minute ) and toilets ( 1.6 gallons of water per flush )			1
the improvements helped reduce the chain 's overall water consumption by 3 percent in 2007			1
marriott : over the past 10 years , the company has added some 400,000 low - flow showerheads and toilets to all of its locations worldwide			1
@entity116 also buys 1 million towels annually that do n't require prewashing , conserving 6 million gallons of water each year			0
@entity72 : all new element hotels will have low - flow water fixtures in rooms and water - efficient landscaping ; its @entity78 star has led the way , saving up to 1 million gallons of water per year			1
@entity132 thinking about the environment from the foundation up @entity49 : the @entity51 brand broke ground last year on an ultra-green building near @entity138 , with laminate flooring made from recycled wood chips and a solar - powered water - heating system			0
@entity142 : opening this year in @entity145 , @entity146 , the chain 's first @entity26 - certified hotel will run partially on solar power and have a porous asphalt parking lot to reduce storm - water runoff			0
@entity91 : the company 's green gem is in @entity152 , @entity153 : a leed - approved hotel with low - emission paint on the walls and special drains that funnel rainwater into wells for future use			1
hyatt : @entity163 's @entity162 , which opened in january , has an 8,000 - square - foot rooftop garden , water - efficient dual - flush toilets , outlets in the parking lot for electric cars , and lighting controlled by room key cards			1
marriott : in 2005 , the @entity116 in @entity172 , @entity173 , was the first chain hotel in the @entity17 to become @entity26 certified			2
among the earth - friendly frills : kitchen composting , in - room recycling bins , water pitchers instead of plastic bottles , and an organic restaurant			0
@entity72 : all eight element locations being built across the country this year have carpets and cushions made from recycled materials , art mounted on frames constructed from old tires , and priority parking for guests with hybrids			0
recycling allowing not a single can , bottle , or plastic key card to go to waste hyatt : starting this year , the company will only use key cards and shampoo and lotion containers made from recycled plastics			0
@entity9 has also begun recycling its own aluminum , plastics , and paper in countries such as @entity206 and @entity207 where such programs do n't exist			2
intercontinental : as part of a pilot program started two years ago , about 140 @entity213 properties donated old furniture and linens to local families following renovations -- helping to cut back on landfill			2
it hopes to replicate the initiative nationwide			0
marriott : each year , the chain buys 47 million pens and 24 million key cards made from recycled plastics ; it has also eliminated styrofoam and plastic utensils at all of its locations			0
