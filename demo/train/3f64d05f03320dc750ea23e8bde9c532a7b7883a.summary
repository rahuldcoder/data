if you @entity8 " @entity1 , " many articles say the drug is " pure " mdma , the active ingredient in @entity1			1
users often talk about the " purity " of taking @entity1 , as if it 's somehow better ; after all , @entity1 was originally developed as a medication to treat depression			2
but today 's @entity1 is most often not @entity1 -- in the last few years , the drug has become a toxic mixture of lab - created chemicals , according to the @entity17			1
here are nine things everyone should know about this rapidly changing party drug : 1			2
what is @entity1 ? someone who buys or takes @entity1 now is probably ingesting dangerous synthetic drugs that have not been tested and are produced in widely varying strengths			1

they can also cause a rapid heartbeat , high blood pressure , blood vessel constriction and sweating , and can prevent the body from regulating temperature			0
some of the chemicals have been reported to cause intense , prolonged panic attacks , psychosis and seizures			0
after they wear off , the chemicals can cause devastating depression			0
several of these compounds have caused deaths			0

what makes @entity1 so dangerous ? @entity1 is dangerous because of the toxic mix of unknown chemicals ; users have no idea what they 're taking or at what dose			1
unlike @entity1 and other illegal drugs that have known effects on the body , the formulas for these synthetic drugs keep changing , and they 're manufactured with no regard to how they affect the user			1
" you 're playing @entity92 roulette if you take these compounds because we 're seeing significant batch - to - batch variances , " @entity62 says			1
for example , officials have found completely different ingredients in drugs sold in the same packaging			0
@entity62 also says the amount of active ingredients can be dangerously different , because " the dosing for these sorts of drugs are in the micrograms			0
the room for error is tremendous , and we 've seen a lot of deaths with some of these compounds			0
" the @entity17 has developed its own reference materials for state and local law enforcement because they were encountering so many different drug compounds they 'd never seen before			2

what you need to know about synthetic drugs 6			1
where do the chemicals come from ? almost all the chemicals in @entity1 and other synthetic drugs come from laboratories in @entity130			1
@entity130 chemists sell the drugs online , and middlemen in the @entity134 and around the world cut it with other substances , and either place it in capsules or sell it as powder			1
other kinds of synthetic drugs can be sprayed onto plant material and smoked , such as synthetic marijuana			1
but it 's difficult for law enforcement to keep track of all the chemicals			0
the @entity17 says it 's seen about 200 individual chemical compounds since 2009 and 80 new compounds since 2012			2
as soon as a compound is discovered and banned , another one is created to take its place			0

the formulas could n't be used as medicine because of the stimulant or hallucinogenic effects they had users , but the " recipes " for the drugs still remain			0
clandestine chemists have used the scientific literature to create hundreds of new chemical compounds for the sole purpose of getting people high			0
