-- the @entity1 says that only " natural born citizens " are eligible to be president			1
is sen. @entity4 of @entity5 eligible , given that he was born in @entity6 of a @entity8 citizen mother and a @entity10 immigrant father ? if @entity4 runs , 2016 will be the third consecutive election in which there were questions about the right of a major party candidate to serve			1
unfortunately , the @entity16 left few clues about exactly what a " natural born citizen " is ; @entity20 has not used the phrase in citizenship statutes since 1790			1
indeed , the phrase is so obscure that it has been called the @entity1 's worst provision by the dean of the @entity25			2
but it is likely that @entity4 is a natural born citizen , because he was a citizen by birth			1
in any event , even if there were some question , the courts are unlikely to interfere with the decisions of the electorate about who we want as our president			2
we have clear rules for who is a citizen by birth , and who can become a citizen after birth by naturalization , but neither the @entity1 nor laws passed by @entity20 define " natural born citizen			1
" the phrase comes from the @entity47 common law , which defined the term as including anyone who , by natural law , owed duties to , and was protected by , the monarch			0
the sovereign expected obedience from anyone born in the country , other than the child of a foreign diplomat or an enemy soldier			0
so children born in @entity47 , even to parents who were not @entity47 themselves , were natural born subjects			1
as such they were obligated to pay taxes , say , or perform military service , and they had the rights of @entity47 people			0
the word " natural " was critical			0
@entity47 courts found that some people were naturally subjects if born in the dominion of the sovereign even if @entity73 had passed no law making them such			2
simply being born naturally created rights and duties			0
politics : who is eligible to run for president ? the @entity8 had natural citizenship in this same sense ; white people born in the @entity8 were always regarded as citizens , even before the @entity84 , passed in 1868 , put that principle in the @entity1 and extended it to african - americans			1
clearly , those born in the @entity8 are eligible to be president ; if they are not , no one is			1
there is also wide agreement that people who became citizens after birth , such as former governors @entity95 and @entity97 , can not run			0
naturalized citizens are ineligible , no matter how able and popular , no matter how loyal and integrated into @entity8 society			2
the question about eligibility has always been with regard to children of @entity8 citizens born overseas , like @entity4 , and @entity107 presidential candidates @entity105 and @entity108 before him			1
the @entity109 has held that foreign - born children are @entity8 citizens only to the extent that a law passed by @entity20 makes them so			2
as the child of a @entity8 citizen mother , @entity4 was born a citizen by virtue of the @entity117			1
but did that make him a natural born citizen ? the @entity8 has citizens , not subjects ; we are a nation of free people , not ruled by a hereditary sovereign			1
therefore , the @entity47 concept does not translate directly to the @entity8 context			0
instead , the question is who is a natural member of the political community			0
most immigration and citizenship scholars , including me , believe that the answer is that any person who is a @entity8 citizen at birth is naturally a part of the political community and hence eligible to be president			1
( i argued that @entity105 was not eligible , because the statute granting citizenship to people born in the @entity144 was passed only after he was born ; since he was not a citizen at birth , he could not be a natural born citizen			1
) there is a far - fetched counterargument , that only those who have citizenship by natural right , those born in the @entity8 -- and perhaps only white people born in the @entity8 -- are truly natural - born because only they are citizens without some law like the @entity117 or a constitutional amendment like the @entity84 making them so			1
all others , who are granted citizenship because of some action by @entity20 , are mere naturalized citizens			0
this argument seems wrong to most scholars			0
but whatever its merits , it is not likely to be tested in court			0
judges appropriately hesitate to overrule the democratic process			0
if @entity4 runs and is challenged , the courts will almost certainly rule that a random voter has no standing to challenge his candidacy			2
other candidates are not likely to sue , but rather will focus on trying to win the election			0
judges will recognize that , at bottom , it is hard to find a legitimate reason that @entity4 or any other person in his situation should be denied the presidency if the people of the @entity8 want him			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			0

sen. @entity4 was born in @entity6 of a @entity8 citizen mother and @entity10 immigrant father
@entity182 says @entity1 is vague on the exact *standards* to run for president
@entity182 says *requirement* to be a " natural born citizen " is not totally clear
he says most scholars think @entity4 is eligible , and courts likely would *n't* *bar* him
