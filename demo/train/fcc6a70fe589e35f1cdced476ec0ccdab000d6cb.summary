-- the growing number of foreign websites that offer counterfeit or stolen goods continues to threaten @entity6 technology , products and jobs			1
illegal counterfeiting and piracy costs the @entity6 economy $ 100 billion and thousands of jobs every year			1
@entity13 can not stand by and do nothing while some of @entity6 's most profitable and productive industries are under attack			1
internet protest stalls online piracy bills in @entity13 the @entity20 protects consumers and innovators by targeting foreign websites that traffic in stolen or counterfeit products , everything from movies to medicine to baby food			1
a great deal of misinformation about the bill has been spread around the @entity33			1
this information does a disservice to consumers , and it is being disseminated by those who have profited from working with illegal websites that steal and sell @entity6 's intellectual property			1
for instance , @entity39 -- a major opponent of the bill -- paid $ 500 million to settle a criminal investigation for promoting foreign illegal online pharmacies , possibly endangering @entity6 ' health			1
so their claims that @entity20 will " censor " the @entity33 are self - serving			2
the online blackout that occurred this week , which included @entity48 , was also misleading			0
@entity48 has nothing to fear from @entity20			2
it is ironic that a website dedicated to providing information knowingly offered misinformation about the bill			2
@entity20 will not harm @entity48 , domestic blogs or social networking sites			2
opinion : why @entity20 still needs work hyperbole has been rampant in the debate about @entity20			0
however , the bill in no way censors the @entity33			0
it only targets activity that is already illegal , and only targets foreign websites that are dedicated to illegal or infringing activity			0
in fact , it is similar to laws that already govern websites based in the @entity6 what has not been publicized is the broad support for @entity20			1
it has been endorsed by a diverse group of organizations , including the @entity76 , @entity77 , the @entity78 , the @entity79 and the @entity80			0
the bill has even united strange bedfellows : the @entity83 and the @entity84			0
it 's not every day that you see business and labor on the same side of an issue			0
even the @entity91 has weighed in , endorsing the need for legislation to combat online piracy that protects free speech , the @entity33 and @entity6 's intellectual property			1
like the @entity91 , i oppose the censorship of legal activity on the @entity33			0
i respect the @entity100 and believe that any legislation passed by @entity13 must protect and defend our constitutional rights			0
but illegal and criminal activity is not protected by the @entity100 simply because it takes place online			0
for example , there is no @entity100 right to view , distribute or download child pornography over the @entity33			0
like child pornography , the theft of intellectual property is also illegal in the @entity6			2
the @entity20 works by cutting off the money to foreign illegal sites and making it harder for online criminals to market and distribute illegal products to @entity6 consumers			1
the bill includes provisions that " follow the money " to cut off the main sources of revenue to these sites , and also protects consumers from being directed to foreign illegal websites by search engines			2
and it provides innovators with a way to bring claims against foreign illegal sites that steal and sell their technology , inventions and products			0
opinion : online piracy laws must preserve web freedom i realize some people are nervous because of the misinformation surrounding this bill , but i am confident that ultimately the facts will overcome fears			2
i am open to constructive suggestions that protect @entity6 inventors and intellectual property rights holders			1
unfortunately , some critics simply want to maintain the status quo that harms @entity6 companies , consumers and innovators			1
we will continue to work with members of @entity13 , outside organizations and stakeholders to reach consensus and produce strong legislation that protects @entity6 innovators and jobs			1
editor 's note : @entity164 , the parent company of @entity0 , is among the industry supporters of the legislation			0
join @entity167 on @entity168 and follow updates on @entity170 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			0

illegal counterfeiting and piracy hurt the @entity6 economy
@entity173 : @entity20 *designed* to protect consumers , companies
@entity173 : misinformation about the bill has spread around the internet
he 's open to constructive suggestions that will produce strong *anti-piracy* legislation
