@entity0 -- @entity2 asked @entity4 's estate to repay the concert promoter $ 300,000 for dr. @entity7 's fee three weeks after @entity4 's death , court testimony revealed monday			1
the revelation contradicts @entity2 's defense that it did not hire or pay the doctor convicted in @entity4 's death			1
" to me , it 's a mistake , " @entity14 vice president and general counsel @entity15 said when confronted with a letter sent to @entity4 's estate			1
@entity15 , testifying monday in the @entity4 wrongful death trial , also said his company 's chief financial officer made another major error by classifying dr. @entity7 's fees as " production costs " and not " advances " in all of the budgets for @entity4 's " this it it " tour			1
" mistakenly , yes , " @entity15 said			0
despite these " mistakes , " @entity15 called the cfo " a very detailed - oriented guy			0
" @entity4 's mother and children are suing @entity2 , contending the concert promoter is liable in the singer 's death because its executives negligently hired , retained or supervised dr. @entity7 , who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter			1
the promoters ignored a series of red flags that should have warned them @entity4 was in danger as he was pressured to get ready for his comeback concerts , the @entity4 lawsuit claims			0
@entity2 lawyers counter that it was @entity4 who chose , hired and supervised @entity7 , and that he was responsible for his own bad decisions			2
its executives could not be expected to know @entity7 was using the surgical anesthetic propofol , the drug the coroner ruled killed @entity4 , to treat his insomnia , they argue			0
testimony from @entity15 -- and , earlier , @entity2 controller @entity57 -- showed the company 's budgets included $ 1.5 million to pay @entity7 $ 150,000 a month			1
the budget terminology could be key in the jury 's decision on @entity2 's liability , since production costs were the promoter 's responsibility , while advances were basically loans to @entity4			1
the revelation that the doctor 's fees were designated as production contradicts the defense that @entity2 lead lawyer @entity74 shared with @entity1 before the trial			1
@entity2 's role with @entity7 was only to " forward " money owed to him by @entity4 , just as a patient would use his " @entity80 , " @entity74 said			1
" if you go to your doctor and you pay with a credit card , obviously , @entity80 in that instance , depending on your credit card , is providing the money to that doctor for services until you pay it back			0
now , are you telling them @entity80 in some measure in that instance , did @entity80 hire the doctor or did you ? well , clearly you did			0
i think the analogy works in this instance			0
" @entity4 manager 's e-mails found , could be key in @entity2 trial the doctor signed the contract prepared by @entity2 lawyers and sent it back to the company a day before @entity4 's death			1
the company argues it was not an executed contract because their executives and @entity4 never signed it			0
the @entity4 lawyers argue that e-mails , budget documents and the fact that the doctor was already working for two months showed a binding agreement between @entity2 and @entity7			2
@entity112 , speaking outside of the courtroom friday , said he would also ask @entity15 about @entity2 's insurance claim , which he said his team recently discovered was filed with @entity115 on june 25 , 2009 , hours after @entity4 was pronounced dead at @entity116			2
that revelation may not relate to the heart of the wrongful death lawsuit against @entity4 's last concert promoter , but @entity4 lawyers hope it could sway jurors to see @entity2 executives as motivated by money over the pop icon 's needs			2
@entity127 calls @entity4 ' a pedophile ' a @entity115 underwriter later sued @entity2 , claiming the company failed to disclose information about the pop star 's health and drug use			2
@entity2 dropped its claim for a $ 17.5 million insurance policy last year			0
choreographer : @entity2 considered pulling plug on comeback @entity4 lawyers played video testimony of one of @entity2 's own expert witnesses friday -- 25 - year veteran tour manager @entity143			1
the opinion @entity143 submitted for @entity2 concluded he saw no red flags that should have alerted the promoter that something was wrong with @entity7			2
he was asked if @entity2 should have realized something was wrong when @entity7 initially asked for $ 5 million a year to work as @entity4 's personal physician			1
" that raised a red flag because of the enormous sum of money , " @entity143 testified			0
@entity143 acknowledged he had not seen many of the documents and depositions in the case , and @entity2 was considering him for a job as the @entity160 tour manager at the same time he was asked to testify			0
witness : ' everybody was lying ' after @entity4 died			0
