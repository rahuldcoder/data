-- a growing scandal over the manipulation of health care appointments resulted in an employee at a @entity7 clinic of the @entity8 being placed on administrative leave , va secretary @entity1 said friday			1
an e-mail allegedly written by an employee in @entity12 , obtained by @entity0 , says : " yes , it is gaming the system a bit			1
but you have to know the rules of the game you are playing , and when we exceed the 14 - day measure , the front office gets very upset , which does n't help us			0
let me know if this does n't make sense			0
" the @entity25 chief @entity24 who says she supplied the e-mail to investigators told @entity0 in an exclusive interview that employees were told to " game the system because it made @entity12 look good			1
" @entity0 confirmed with investigators that she was the source of the e-mail			1
the e-mail outlined ways employees could manipulate the system to hide the fact that veterans had to wait months for appointments , said @entity40 , a scheduler at the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44 , which is managed by the @entity7 clinic			1
" we were sat down by our supervisor ... and he showed us exactly how to schedule so it looked like it was within that 14 - day period , " @entity46 told @entity0			1
" they would keep track of schedulers who were complying and getting 100 percent of that 14 day ( s ) and those of us who were not			0
" the @entity8 's official policy is that all patients should be able to see a doctor , dentist or some other medical professional within 14 days of their requested / preferred date			1
any wait longer than two weeks is supposed to documented			2
but many veterans end up waiting longer , and the delays are never reported , veterans and their advocates say			2
@entity1 released a statement saying he has ordered an investigation by the inspector general , and that the employee be removed immediately from patient care responsibilities and placed on leave			0
" @entity8 takes any allegations about patient care or employee misconduct very seriously , " @entity1 said			2
" if true , the behavior outlined in the email is unacceptable			0
" rep. @entity80 , chairman of @entity81 , which subpoenaed @entity1 to testify next week , said in a statement that " the @entity8 's reaction to the latest development in its delays in care scandal is faux outrage at its finest			1
" " since last year , @entity8 officials have known about intentional efforts to falsify patient wait time data at the @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity92 , which is part of the @entity94 , " @entity80 said in the statement			1
" in fact , according to a dec. 2013 @entity98 report , clerks at the @entity43 clinic were actually taught how to cook the books			0
yet until today , department officials had not taken any steps whatsoever to discipline any employees or request an independent investigation -- nor did they plan to do so			0
" @entity80 said @entity1 's actions friday appear " to be more of a knee - jerk reaction to tough media questions than anything else			0
if this is what it takes for @entity8 leaders to do the right thing , you ca n't help but question how they operate when they think no one is paying attention			2
" the latest allegation comes as the federal department defends itself against claims of potentially deadly delays at other facilities throughout the nation , including claims of a secret wait list in @entity127 , which was first reported by @entity0			1
an new interim director , @entity129 , will take over the @entity130 on monday , the department announced friday			0
he takes over an embattled system responsible for 85,000 veterans and an operating budget of about $ 500 million			2
on thursday , @entity127 va director @entity134 , associate director @entity135 and a third employee , who was not identified , were placed on leave amid allegations of a secret waiting list and claims that more than 40 veterans died waiting for care			1
the @entity142 , the nation 's largest veterans organization , and another group , @entity145 , have called for @entity1 's resignation			0
sen. @entity147 , @entity148 , told @entity0 on friday that if the mounting accusations are true , " people should go to jail			1
" he spoke before news broke of the @entity7 clinic e-mail			0
@entity147 's comments came the same day that he appeared at a @entity127 town hall meeting in which a procession of veterans and their families criticized what they described as widespread delays and mismanagement within the national health care system designed for @entity164 's veterans			1
" if it is what it appears to be , this is n't just resignations , this is violations of the law , " @entity147 told @entity0 's @entity165			2
" people should go to jail			0
" the former pow said , " not surprisingly ... this is spreading ...			0
and we need to hold people accountable			0
" @entity147 told the town hall meeting that @entity1 called him to say he had ordered a " face - to - face audit " at all @entity8 clinics but wanted to wait for an @entity8 inspector general 's report before revealing his findings			1
" my friends , an inspector general 's report can take months			0
i told him we can not wait a day , much less months , before there is a report , " @entity147 said amid applause			0
@entity1 ordered the audit thursday			0
the same day , the @entity81 subpoenaed him			0
the subpoena will cover e-mails that allegedly discussed the destruction of a secret list , first reported by @entity0 , of veterans waiting for care at a @entity195			1
attention on the secretary follows months of @entity0 exclusive reporting about @entity164 veterans who have died while they waited for treatment at @entity8 hospitals			1
@entity0 has submitted numerous requests for an interview with @entity1 ; the secretary has refused them all			2
on thursday , a @entity8 scheduler in @entity206 , said clerks scheduling medical appointments for veterans were " cooking the books " at their bosses ' behest to hide the fact some had to wait weeks , if not months , for appointments			1
the @entity215 confirmed to @entity0 that it has staff investigators on the ground in @entity206 looking into the allegations .			2
