-- the state of @entity2 gave us @entity4 , @entity6 @entity5 and @entity7			0
that 's a lot of big - time @entity9			1
but added together their moral authority would total a tiny fraction of that established over a half - century by @entity14			1
if i did n't know @entity14 was a real person , i would swear he was invented , a character in a sports adventure novel written for boys in the 1950s			1
there he 'd stand on the sidelines , hands behind his back , squinting in the sunlight , @entity14 , legendary coach at @entity24 , the beacon of moral and physical courage , the shepherd of lost boys , pater familias in a place called @entity24			1
an author could not invent a better name : @entity14			1
@entity33 , father of a holy family of student athletes			0
@entity38 , as in @entity39 for father			0
our father , who art in trouble , hollow be thy name			0
you hear it all the time : " football is a religion in @entity2 " ( or @entity51 or @entity52 )			2
to the @entity54 students rioting in the streets wednesday night , @entity14 was pope , a word that also means father			1
not only does pope denote the @entity61 bishop of @entity62 , it now can describe , according to the @entity63 , any " person considered to have unquestioned authority			1
" the sacred role of the father as protector of the family is central to many cultures , including the @entity71			0
this is not just a theory for me			0
above my desk are three photographs : one of my grandfather , @entity78 , as a young political candidate in @entity80 ; another of the ship that carried his family from @entity84 to @entity85 ; a third , a copy of the ship 's manifest , which lists him , at the age of 4 , with his mother , father and two older sisters			1
they have 12 cents to their name			0
when in 1972 i called my grandfather ( our name for him was @entity37 ! ) to announce the birth of his first great - grandchild , i could hear his tears , and then his words : " remember , @entity104 , the most important thing in life is family			2
" how many of us as children have invested our hopes and dreams in the patriarch ? " the father is head of the family , " goes the familiar theological injunction , " as @entity115 is head of the church			2
" what happens , then , when little @entity117 discovers that his beloved father is also the head of a @entity122 family ? @entity123			0
what happens when a beloved father abandons a family , or shames it ? most of us can remember with exquisite regret the moment that our faith in a father or father figure was shattered , a loss that can carry dark consequences			0
most institutions , even the @entity122 , want to avoid scandal			0
the lower or higher the moral authority of that institution , the more that avoidance of scandal takes priority			0
princes of the @entity144 hid knowledge of sexual predation within their ranks , not because they wished harm to children , but because knowledge of that scandal would stain the soul of the @entity144 -- and undermine its good works -- forever			1
consider the @entity54 scandal in the same light			1
why did n't " leaders of men " call the police on @entity156 , now accused of sexual assault , one of their own ? not because they wanted boys to be raped in locker rooms			2
silence and inaction ruled because exposure of abuse threatened to tear down everything that @entity14 had built up , not just a team or athletic program , but a story he had written for the university : that honor , sportsmanship , academic achievement and traditional @entity177 @entity176 values could attach themselves to a multimillion dollar sports enterprise			1
@entity14 as @entity180 : big man on campus			2
the word " fan " comes from " fanatic			0
" the " enthusiasm " that rocks a stadium derives from the @entity190 word meaning " to have @entity115 in you , " a word that once carried the negative connotation of zealotry			0
if my connecting @entity54 to the @entity144 ( and to the @entity122 ) strikes you as offensive or at least out of proportion , consider how @entity199 it all is			2
it is the @entity144 after all ; and the @entity84 crime syndicates organized themselves like the @entity202 , with heads and heads of heads			2
as for @entity54 ? just stroll around the ruins of the @entity207 in @entity62			2
bread and circuses has evolved into something a bit more civilized -- beer and football -- but the purpose remains the same : to entertain and distract through a quasi-religious communal experience , an emotional ritual that serves as a substitute for war			0
a famous sports editor , @entity219 , told his reporters to stop " godding up " the athletes , to quit converting sweaty football players into the @entity223			0
the time may have come , through the excruciating agony of innocent boys , to stop godding up the coaches , and to dismantle brick by brick the arrogance of those who would turn a sport into a religion			1
commentators on sports television and radio have raised their sanctimonious voices to instruct us that this scandal is " not about football			0
" that 's like saying the sexual abuse of altar boys is " not about religion			0
" the scandal at @entity54 turns out to be -- as it always is -- more about the cover - up than the original crimes			1
the cover - up did n't work for @entity247 , or @entity248 in @entity249 , or for @entity14			1
if @entity14 has been the pope of the @entity250 , he turned the rest of us into acolytes			1
how many of us learned to bow down and obey , leaving our skepticism outside the church door ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity258 .			1

@entity258 : legendary @entity54 coach @entity14 is like a *mythical* paternal figure
he says *loyalty* to him holds *echoes* of @entity61 , @entity84 - @entity176 reverence for pope
he says perhaps @entity156 sex abuse hushed for fear it would stain soul of @entity54 " church "
@entity258 : time to dismantle this " church " and stop protecting its fathers from their sins
