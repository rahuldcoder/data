@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's wife told jurors tuesday that she could remember at least six of her husband 's accusers staying overnight at their house			1

she testified that children would often sleep at the @entity21 ' house and that " we would give them a choice of where they wanted to sleep			0
" her husband was also typically the one to put the children to sleep , she said , telling jurors that " he would go downstairs and tell them good night			0
" meanwhile , @entity4 's attorney told reporters tuesday to " stay tuned " to see if his client will testify in a child rape case that has upended @entity35 and its football program			1
" you have to wait , " attorney @entity37 said just before entering the @entity1 courthouse and calling witnesses for a second day			0
@entity4 , 68 , is on trial on 51 counts related to accusations of sexually abusing 10 boys over a 15 - year span			1
the former @entity35 defensive coordinator has denied the charges			0
@entity4 trial : all you need to know questions about @entity4 's mental health continue to loom over the proceedings			1
dr. @entity53 testified that he had diagnosed @entity4 with histrionic personality disorder after interviewing the former coach			1
but a second psychologist , dr. @entity56 , disputed those findings tuesday , saying that the " personality profile mr. @entity4 exhibited was within normal limits			2
" the prosecution had earlier presented as evidence what one accuser described as " creepy love letters , " written by @entity4			1
they argued the letters were part of " grooming techniques " commonly employed by sexual predators			0
judge @entity70 issued an order friday allowing a defense motion to offer expert testimony from a psychologist who " will explain that the words , tones , requests and statements made in the letters are consistent with a person who suffers from a histrionic personality disorder			0
" " the goal of a person suffering from this disorder in writing those letters would not necessarily be to groom or sexually consummate a relationship in a criminal manner , but rather to satisfy the needs of a psyche belabored by the needs of such a disorder , " the defense lawyers wrote in their motion			0
histrionic personality disorder is part of a class of conditions called dramatic personality disorders , which are marked by unstable emotions and distorted self - images , according to the @entity101			0
separately , after being subpoenaed by prosecutors , @entity102 provided court officials with transcripts and footage of a @entity108 interview with the former coach , according to @entity102 spokeswoman @entity110			1
" i did n't go around seeking out every young person for sexual needs that i 've helped , " the former coach told the @entity102 sportscaster in an interview segment that was n't part of the november 2011 broadcast , but has since been aired			1
@entity4 said there are likely " many young people who would come forward and say that my methods and what i had done for them made a very positive impact on their life			1
" if the former coach testifies , those comments could potentially be entered as new evidence			0
early in the trial , @entity37 implied that @entity4 would take the stand			2
closing arguments could begin as soon as thursday , with the defense expected to end its case midday wednesday , followed by the prosecution 's rebuttal			0
@entity4 routinely " got showers with kids " after working out , and he would say so later , @entity37 said monday			2
but as the trial nears its end , it remains unclear if @entity4 will speak			2
@entity139 , a veteran criminal defense attorney , said there has been a " tsunami of evidence against him " and suggested that the former coach should take the stand			0
@entity4 's child sex abuse allegations : in his own words " just maybe he can convince one juror to hold out , " the lawyer said			1
" a hung jury , right now , is a lot better than life without parole			2
" prosecutors wrapped up their case monday morning with brief testimony from the mother of one of the alleged victims			0
" he gave him clothes , he gave him gifts , " the mother of an accuser called @entity162 testified			0
" i just wish he 'd given him underwear to replace the underwear i could never find in my laundry			0
" the final prosecution witness testified monday that her son seemed to suffer from stomach ailments during the times he was visiting @entity4 and sometimes did not want to visit the former @entity35 assistant 's home			1
but she said she did n't ask him about any possible abuse and still does not know what happened to him			2
" i did n't really want to hear , " she said , crying			0
the defense then opened its case with a former @entity35 coach who testified about @entity4 's stellar reputation in the community			1
@entity184 said it was not uncommon for coaches and youths to use the shower at the same time , and that he had never seen anything inappropriate between @entity4 and a child			2
the defense called five other witnesses who also said @entity4 had a stellar reputation in the community			2
a main focus of the defense 's strategy may be to attempt to poke holes in the prosecution 's case thus far			0
" a lot of people lied , " @entity37 said last monday in his opening statement			0
over four days , several people testified that @entity4 forced them to engage in sexual acts with him in various places , including showers in the @entity35 coaches ' locker room , hotel rooms and the basement of his home			1
' @entity213 ' describe seduction , molestation , betrayal one told jurors that @entity4 -- whom he met , like many of the accusers , through the @entity222 nonprofit for disadvantaged youths that the ex-coach founded -- had threatened him if he told others about the abuse			1
another said @entity4 warned he might send him home from a trip to @entity230 , where they 'd gone to watch a @entity35 bowl game			2
the defense could challenge the accusers ' timetable , questioning if @entity4 could have committed the crimes they claim he did when they say he did			2
what is histrionic personality disorder ? on monday , prosecutors dropped one of the 52 counts against @entity4 because the statute he was charged with was n't in effect on the date of the alleged incident			1
the accuser said the incident occurred in 1995 or 1996 , but the unlawful contact with a minor statute did n't apply until 1997			0
