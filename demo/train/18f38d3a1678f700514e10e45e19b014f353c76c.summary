-- president @entity3 has told @entity4 that he 's willing to stay away from election battles where his presence would not be helpful , a @entity2 source said -- an apparent nod to his poll numbers			1
@entity3 's comments came when he and former president @entity10 attended the @entity4 ' issues conference at @entity12 on wednesday			1
sources at the meeting said @entity3 assured @entity4 that maintaining control of the @entity4 is his top priority this year			2
" i do n't remember him ( @entity3 ) saying he would n't be offended if he was n't invited ( to help campaign ) , but he certainly acknowledged how low his numbers are in certain states , " a source told @entity0			1
but @entity3 also noted " they are bad in some states overall , " and " that certain people would need him to help in certain parts of those states , " that source said			2
according to a @entity0 / @entity29 poll conducted last weekend , @entity3 's approval rating stood at 45 % , with his disapproval at 50 %			1
those numbers are slightly better than two months before , when the approval ratings ran at or near all - time lows for the president			1
but it 's still far below where it stood a year ago , at his second inaugural , when his approval rating stood in the low to mid 50s in most polling			1
with a number of vulnerable @entity2 senators up for re-election this year , sources at wednesday 's meeting said @entity3 vowed to do what he could to support @entity2 candidates			2
the @entity2 caucus currently holds a 55 - 45 majority in the 100 - member chamber , but 21 @entity2 - controlled seats are up this year as opposed to only 15 @entity54 seats			0
making matters worse for @entity4 is the consensus view that the overwhelming majority of vulnerable seats are currently held by @entity4			0
the meeting served as a question - and - answer opportunity between @entity4 and the president			0
some @entity4 up for re-election asked @entity3 questions , but they focused on substantive topics , largely avoiding politics , according to one source			2
" there was amazingly little politics , virtually no politics , " said that source , who called the meeting " positive " and " not defensive " on anyone 's part			0

sen. @entity82 , a @entity83 from red - state @entity84 who faces a challenging bid for second term in the @entity4 , told @entity0 last week that " i 'm not really interested in campaigning " with @entity3 if the president came to @entity84 , he said			2
it was a similar story from sen. @entity90			0
the @entity91 @entity83 is also up for re-election , but his seat is n't considered that vulnerable as of now			0
in an interview with @entity0 last week , @entity90 refused to say whether he 'd like some help on the campaign trail if the president comes to @entity91 , a purple state that @entity3 won in both the 2008 and 2012			1
" we 'll see what the president 's schedule is , what my schedule is			0
but @entity105 are going to re-elect me based on my record , not the president 's record , " @entity2 sens. @entity109 of @entity110 and @entity111 of @entity112 both have made news in the recent months by not appearing with @entity3 when he 's held an event in their state			1
