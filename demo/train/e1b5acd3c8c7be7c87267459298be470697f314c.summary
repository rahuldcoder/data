@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a few short days , @entity5 flight attendant @entity3 has achieved folk - hero status			2
he 's the man who allegedly cursed out a disruptive passenger over the on - board public address system , then opened an aircraft door , inflating the emergency chute in the process			1
he grabbed a beer from a service cart and slid down , effectively saying " @entity17 " to his 20 - year flying career			2
@entity19 's exit created a danger to ramp workers and could earn him a prison stay			1
nevertheless , his actions call attention to escalating tensions between flight attendants and the passengers they serve			1
they also highlight a little known issue that 's a big problem for flight attendants			1
for the last 25 years , i 've worked as a flight attendant for a large @entity33 carrier			0
many times i 've been in @entity19 's position : a passenger opens the overhead bin to retrieve a carry - on bag before the captain says the plane has safely reached the gate			1
( for safety reasons , attendants are trained to make sure passengers stay in their seats , overhead bins remain closed and carry - on bags are properly stowed " until the aircraft reaches the gate and the captain turns off the fasten seat belt sign			1
" ) most offenders are simply eager to get off a cramped airplane and willingly sit down when asked			0
but occasionally -- as was possibly the case with the passenger @entity19 responded to -- some passengers think the rules do n't apply to them			1
i 've been glared at , verbally abused , threatened with lawsuits and recriminations from @entity59 simply because i asked a passenger to comply with the rules			0
what exactly are the rules ? why do they seem different from one flight to the next ? and what authority do flight attendants have when it comes to enforcing them ? the answer to that last and most compelling question is " zero			1
" contrary to what you may think , flight attendants have absolutely no authority aboard an aircraft			0
we are not police officers or security personnel			0
we are not empowered by law to enforce airline policy , @entity83 regulation or criminal mischief			2
we ca n't force noncompliant passengers to buckle their seat belts , stow their tray tables , turn off cell phones , put away pornographic magazines ( yes , it happens ) or stay in their seats until the plane docks			2
all we can do is approach the passenger , explain " the rules " and hope they comply			0
failing that , the only recourse is to call the captain , who , depending on his or her disposition , may not address the problem adequately			0
consequently , flight attendants often find themselves between a rock and a hard place			0
it 's frustrating when your employer demands that you impose policy without giving you the means to do so			0
perhaps this is why @entity19 snapped			2
while i disagree with the manner in which he vented , like @entity114 says , " i understand			0
" as far as carry - on bags are concerned , the rules , which are seemingly clear but not uniformly enforced , are a major point of contention between passengers and crew			1
most carriers limit each passenger to one carry - on bag and one personal item ( i.e. laptop bag , small backpack , etc. )			0
but does a woman 's large purse qualify as personal item ? is she therefore allowed three items when a man is only allowed two ? are passengers allowed more carry - ons on half - empty flights ? this seems reasonable , given the abundance of space in which to stow bags , which is why some attendants and gate agents turn a blind eye to a passenger with too many bags on an empty flight			1
but when that same passenger tries to board a full connecting flight with four bags and is forced to check two in the cargo hold , he may protest vehemently			0
" hey , they let me bring these on my last flight , why wo n't you ? i 'm never flying this # & * @ ! $ * airline again ! " i 've heard this so often and so loudly i 've become numb to the allegation			2
the only way to mitigate passenger - employee conflict and ensure smooth flying is to impose a uniform airline code that begins at the check - in desk and ends at the luggage carousel			1
passengers should be allowed no more than two carry - on bags on every flight ; ticket agents should check all other bags			1
if your tweezers are allowed through security at @entity175 , those same tweezers should be allowed through security on your way home from @entity179			0
disruptive passengers should be blacklisted and banned from future flying			0
and any flight attendant who takes it upon himself to open an emergency exit and slide down the chute because a foul - mouthed passenger wo n't follow the rules , well ... he might find that behavior is not much better in a prison cell .			1

@entity192 says he gets why @entity19 blew up , made dangerous emergency chute exit
he says he 's faced similar situations with passengers who think rules do n't apply to them
but airline rules are *uneven* , he says , and attendants have no power to enforce them
@entity205 : airlines should have uniform code that begins at check - in , ends at baggage claim
