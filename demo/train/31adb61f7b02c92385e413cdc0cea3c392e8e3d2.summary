-- even a sleep expert gets tired sometimes			2
" it 's been a long day , " explains a weary - sounding @entity2 , as he answers the phone to start an interview explaining how he went from aspiring golf pro to the go - to recovery guru for top soccer clubs and @entity9 athletes			1
while , for many of us , sleep deprivation often compounds into a seemingly neverending spiral of exhaustion , @entity11 has dedicated most of his adult life to finding the tools that break the cycle			1
if he has a late night , he knows how to factor it into his schedule and immediately get back on track			2
" @entity25 , as far as mental and physical recovery goes , has never been more important to not only elite sport but everyone i bump into who struggles with their sleep hygiene , " he tells @entity0			2
" they 've just been getting worse and worse and suddenly so out of sync with the natural circadian process that does so much for us			0
eventually you start to become somebody that 's way below what you can achieve at a personal level			0
" not only have we lost touch with our natural body rhythms , which for thousands of years were dictated by sunrise and sunset , @entity2 says most people have little awareness of their sleep patterns and habits			1
" all the executives , all the people doing two jobs , three jobs , and trying to do a semi-amateur pro sport , they 're all trying to make 28 hours out of a 24 - hour cycle , putting too much pressure on it , " he says			2
" more and more athletes who 've moved over to that time are moving back to taking the pressure off the nocturnal period			2
" technology is also playing its part -- people in all walks of life spend more and more time with electronic devices , such as phones and tablets that stimulate the brain with artificial light , forever checking their email and social media updates			0
" the phone i 'm talking to you on now was simply a mobile phone when i was walking around @entity76 in 1998 -- it is now used for so many different things , " @entity2 says			1
" they have a counter-productive effect on a very natural process called our circadian rhythms , which has so many biological consequences in our bodies			0
" what you see now is more different levels of insomnia with athletes either being not able to stay asleep for a long - enough period , or not being able to get into sleep easily enough			1
" the methods that he has used to help footballers at clubs such as @entity76 and @entity96 , along with cycling champions like @entity98 , are surprisingly simple -- once you dump the widely - held sleep concepts that he says have become increasingly obsolete			1
for starters , forget about the convention that dictates we all need eight hours ' sleep every night			2
try 7.5 , nine or even six			0
" it 's dead easy if you look at it in 90 - minute cycles , which is how sleep is measured , " @entity2 says			1
" if you build a sleep routine around 90 - minute cycles it gives a clear indication subconsciously -- it 's not a routine you have to follow every day , but you 've got something to focus on and it allows you to be flexible and it 's so easy to follow			1
" in his case , he aims to be asleep around 11 p.m. and wake up at 6.30 a.m. --- giving himself time for a 90 - minute pre-sleep routine and the same period post waking before starting work			2
if , say , he goes out for dinner after work and gets home later than usual , rather than scramble to get to bed at the usual time , he 'll make sure he still has his 90 - minute slowdown period and aim for the next sleep slot of 12.30 a.m. and still get up at the same time			1
six hours ' sleep might not seem enough , but this is where @entity11 turns to the habit that has died out in many @entity133 countries -- the afternoon nap			2
" we 've got three natural sleep periods every day , and we need to use them , " he says			2
so if you 've missed out overnight , try catching up with a controlled 20 - minute nap between 1 - 3 p.m. or 5 - 7 p.m. the siesta is a traditional break in many countries , especially those in hot climates , and @entity2 noticed it when he went to @entity146 to advise coaching staff at @entity96			1
" come one o'clock the place was deserted			0
they 've got 80 - odd rooms of seven - star suites at their training center , " he says			0
" some players will go there and spend 2 - 3 hours like they would a siesta -- they 'd have some food , have a nap			0
some of them will go home and come back			0
" although it may look on the outside that they play more matches than any other club in @entity166 , if not the world , and they play at ridiculous times at night , but within all of their schedules there is a very strong recovery balance against activity			1
" football gave @entity11 his big break in sport , becoming known as @entity76 's " sleep coach " in 1998 after a chance email to then manager @entity180 earned him an invite to work with the club physio			1
by that stage , his ambitions of being the next @entity184 on the golf circuit were long gone , but he had used many of the sales and networking skills he learned as a club pro to work his way up to the board of @entity194 company @entity193 and a role as chairman of the inaugural @entity194 @entity197			1
" that was trying to change people 's perceptions -- but it was solely driven by retailers trying to sell more beds , not from the premise of improving the way people slept			0
that was really the end of my road , " he says			0
@entity76 had a problem with veteran @entity213 defender @entity212 , who was plagued by constant back pain			1
@entity2 suggested switching his sleeping arrangements -- it did n't cure the problem but helped @entity212 's posture and subsequent rehabilitation			1
it led to the introduction of sleep rooms at @entity76 's @entity224 training ground to allow players to cope with the demands of morning and afternoon sessions , and @entity2 went on to work with the club 's @entity229 rival @entity228 and the @entity213 national team			1
his ideas also caught the attention of @entity234 , which in 2009 was developing the nascent @entity236 pro outfit that would feature @entity238 winner and @entity9 champion @entity239			1
" they were looking at recovery as a big issue and decided that my approach made a lot of sense to not only them but also the individual riders , " says @entity2			1
" we created a sleep kit , which is a replication of the ideal layers -- pillow , duvet , linen -- all put together to allow a small group of staff to go into the hotel and unzip @entity98 's bag , he sleeps in it , they zip it back up and take it to the next hotel			1
" while he 's traveling on a three - week grand tour , every night he would know that that stuff that 's specifically focused on him for mental and physical recovery , it works , he 's tried it			0
" they started to build an enormous perceived value around this area , which is one of the largest chunks of their recovery period every day			0
" @entity239 went on to triumph at cycling 's biggest race in 2012 and that same year won the @entity9 time trial , while @entity273 -- another fan of the sleep kit -- claimed two more games golds to become the sport 's most decorated rider			1
it 's not just athletes who need quality sleep			0
rest deprivation has been shown to take its toll on physical and mental health , impacting on work performance and relationships			0
" there 's a lot of evidence that ( sleep problems are ) some of the real reasons why type two diabetes is going up quite dramatically ... weight control , depression , bipolar , anxiety , stress -- there 's a lot of quite serious health issues , " @entity2 says			1
" they 're finding things like breast cancer in shift - working nurses against non-shift working nurses			0
" so how do you fix broken sleep patterns ? " although it 's a very simple process , once focused on it you realize that you can actually be spending a lot of your valuable time wasting it trying to sleep , " says @entity2 , who recommends the following steps			1
first , work out if you are an early person or a late one ( " lark or owl " ) and how it applies to your work situation			0
next , set constant sleep and wake times using 90 - minute sleep cycles			1
establish 90 - minute periods before sleep that reduce outside stimuli ( i.e. shut down electronic devices ) and bring down your body temperature -- do n't exercise too strenuously at night			1
make sure your bedroom is dedicated to sleep and rest			0
wake up with the sun , or during winter with the help of machines that simulate daylight			0
give yourself 90 minutes to get ready for the day ahead			0
use afternoon naps to catch up on any missed sleep			0
@entity2 says the last of those is often difficult for foreign footballers who join @entity338 clubs , where the culture is very different to their homelands			2
but that is changing as high - flying @entity229 teams such as @entity343 and @entity344 have also taken his ideas on board			0
@entity343 has followed local rival @entity76 in investing in sleeping areas at its training ground , building a complex that will serve as a hotel before home games			2
@entity2 says attitudes towards sleep in sport have changed a lot since he started working in the area , which is being recognized as one of the remaining aspects where human performance can be improved			1
" nobody would ever put their hand up and say i ca n't perform in a team or do that event because i had a poor night 's sleep , " he says			0
" as the years have gone by , the analysis that 's available to sports science professionals has just grown and grown so they know far more about any individual athlete than they ever did before			0
" the performance levels of athletes have continued to improve and increase , so the more and more that happens the human form can only go so far			0
" you can keep improving equipment , nutrition and things like that , but the human being needs to develop in a much better way			0
" for many of us , not just sports stars , a better night 's sleep is a good start .			2
