-- a @entity2 judge on monday signed amended court documents mandating that @entity4 return to @entity5 to serve a year of probation stemming from her check fraud conviction			1
" from my reading of this , she should be reporting to probation in @entity5 probably within 72 hours , " @entity10 circuit judge @entity9 said in signing the documents , according to the @entity12			1
the action came after an apparent misunderstanding in the case			1
@entity19 pleaded guilty in january 2010 to felony check fraud charges , admitting she stole a checkbook from her friend @entity23 and wrote five checks totaling $ 644.25			1
at the time , defense attorney @entity25 asked that @entity19 be given credit for time served and be placed on probation			2
@entity9 apparently intended for the supervised probation to begin after @entity19 's release from custody , said @entity32 , spokesman for the @entity10 state attorney 's office			1
but the order signed by @entity9 at the time seemed to indicate it was to run while she was in custody awaiting trial on murder charges in the 2008 death of her daughter @entity4			0
@entity42 , one of @entity19 's defense attorneys , said his client 's legal team is working to " set aside and vacate the order			1
" he said the order claims @entity25 and @entity19 were present monday for a hearing -- something @entity42 said " did not happen			2
" " from what i can see , it is a fraud , " @entity42 said			0
" we will be addressing that with all due speed and with aggression as the law , procedures , ethics and judicial canons will allow			0
" @entity42 said @entity19 's lawyers will seek to " disqualify mr. @entity9 for the second time			1
" the judge had been presiding over her murder trial until april 2010 , when he recused himself after the defense accused him of being a " self - aggrandizing media hound " who is biased against @entity19			2
@entity10 superior court chief judge @entity64 took over , and stayed in that position through the trial			2
a jury acquitted @entity19 of charges in @entity4 's death			2
the 25 - year - old @entity5 woman was released from jail july 17			0
her whereabouts since then have been unknown			0
@entity32 said prosecutors were surprised to receive a letter from the probation office indicating @entity19 's probation was completed			1
he said there was a miscommunication between what @entity9 said at the sentencing and what the court clerk understood			0
the clerk thought the probation and @entity19 's time in custody were to run concurrently			1
the documents were amended monday to add the words " upon release " to @entity19 's sentencing documents , the @entity12 said			1
@entity10 prosecutors will not take a position on whether @entity19 should serve probation , @entity32 said , adding the issue is between @entity9 , @entity64 , the probation department and the clerk 's office			2
" we do n't think we have jurisdiction			0
the court is the sentencer , and if they think it ( sentencing ) was not followed , they can do something , " @entity99 said			0
" our position is to leave it up to the court			0
" a @entity109 spokeswoman told @entity0 affiliate @entity110 that @entity19 must report to @entity10 within 72 hours			1
" we are moving forward to make sure she is following the judge 's orders , " @entity111 said			2
@entity19 's defense attorneys may challenge the move and claim @entity19 should not have to serve probation because she already did while in custody , according to the @entity12			1
@entity32 said the defense would have a strong argument to have the amended sentencing order declared invalid on grounds of double jeopardy			0
it would be unconstitutional to have @entity19 serve another year of probation if technically she already served it while in jail , he said			2
@entity64 has indicated he wants to meet with officials from the @entity109 to go over what happened and " make corrections			0
" @entity32 said he does not know what that means , and knew of no pending hearings regarding the issue			0
at @entity19 's sentencing on the check fraud charges , she was ordered to have no contact with @entity23 , who testified against her during her murder trial			1
at her sentencing for the check fraud charges last year , @entity19 said , " i just wanted to let everyone know that i 'm sorry for what i did			1
i take complete and full responsibility for my actions , and i 'd like to apologize to @entity23			0
i wish i 'd been a better friend			0
" in @entity150 's @entity149 and @entity151 contributed to this report .			0
