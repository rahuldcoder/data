about 10.3 million @entity0 gained health coverage this year , primarily as a result of the @entity3 , according to a study by the federal government and @entity6 , published wednesday in the @entity7			1
the estimate of newly insured adults — the largest to date — is the first published in a major medical journal and authored by some federal health researchers			2
the federal government had previously reported that about 8 million people bought private health plans on the state and federal exchanges and 6.6 million additional people enrolled in @entity17 since last october			2
but it has not estimated how many of those had been previously uninsured			0
the @entity21 administration took pains yesterday to say that the views of the study 's authors are not those of the administration -- even as it hailed their findings			0
faq : what the @entity3 court decisions mean for you " we are committed to providing every @entity0 with access to quality , affordable health services and this study reaffirms that the @entity3 has set us on a path toward achieving that goal , " @entity33 secretary @entity32 said in a statement			1
" this study also reaffirms that expanding @entity17 under the @entity3 is important for coverage , as well as a good deal for states			1
" the study found that the number of uninsured adults fell by a little over 5 % nationally , from 21 % in september 2013 to 16.3 % in april 2014 , with the most significant declines in the 26 states that expanded @entity17 under the health law			1
while all groups saw reduced uninsurance , the largest changes occurred among @entity58 , blacks and adults between the ages of 18 and 34 -- groups that had been targeted for outreach , the study found			2
the analysis was based on data from a @entity66 , a daily telephone survey of more than 400,000 adults conducted from january 2012 through june 2014 , which the researchers purchased from @entity66			2
it also took into account other surveys and changes in the economy and trends in insurance coverage			0
researchers stressed the data 's limitations , saying the estimate might range from 7.3 to 17.2 million adults depending on the assumptions			0
they noted that the @entity66 data does not include information on children 's insurance coverage			0
it also does n't take account of the young adults who were able to stay on their parent 's policies because it does not go back before 2012			0
@entity94 poll : is @entity3 working ? " the @entity66 data , which draws on an enormous sample , paint a compelling picture , finding a substantial drop in uninsurance since the beginning of the first open enrollment period , precisely where we would expect to see it -- in states that expanded @entity17 coverage and in income groups targeted by @entity17 or the new subsidies for coverage , " said @entity95 , a senior fellow at the nonpartisan @entity96			1
the analysis found that more adults ( approximately 4.4 million ) also reported having a personal doctor and fewer ( 5.3 million ) reported experiencing difficulties paying for medical care			0
" the pattern of coverage gains was consistent with the effects of the @entity3 , with major gains for persons likely to be eligible for expanded @entity17 on the basis of their income and state of residence , but smaller and nonsignificant changes for low - income adults in states without @entity17 expansion , " the study said			1
about 48 million @entity0 , or 15.4 % of the population , lacked health insurance in 2012 , according to the latest @entity131 report from last year			1
why court 's blow to @entity3 wo n't stick			0

according to a joint study , 10 million @entity0 gained health coverage this year
the gain was *due* primarily to the @entity3
there was a 5 % drop in uninsured adults from september 2013 to april 2014
