the transactions , which took place between 2007 and 2009 , have now triggered a probe into the bank 's former management			2
the affair is exposing just how close @entity12 's politicians and banks are intertwined , casting a shadow over the general election on february 24 and 25			0
it threatens to taint the reputations of @entity12 's top political figures , with even @entity46 ( @entity46 ) president @entity45 finding himself under media scrutiny			0

none of the candidates have been accused of any wrong - doing but @entity11 said local party officials were " all up to their necks in @entity66 ... this ought to reflect really badly on the center - left and the @entity57			1
" a city in @entity70 @entity71 -- the small @entity70 city where the banking giant is headquartered -- is a stronghold for @entity55			0
@entity11 pointed to the @entity57 's role in placing the chairman , @entity76 , through the bank 's largest shareholder , @entity71			1

" @entity102 is the leader of @entity103 , a party that together with the @entity104 forms the center - left coalition			1
speaking on behalf of both parties , @entity102 told @entity1 the scandal at @entity66 is due to the exclusive relationshp between the city of @entity71 and the bank creating " over time clearly evident situations of conflict of interests			1

he told lawmakers that @entity12 's banks are solid and supervision by @entity12 's central bank was attentive			0
@entity168 said @entity181 's remarks were an " empty defense " and he echoed the sentiments of @entity51 's party secretary @entity190 and @entity191 , telling @entity1 : " in the first place , do n't tell us that the [ @entity57 ] is not involved ... number two ; do n't tell us the @entity195 is completely not responsible for it			2
