-- @entity1 initially opted for a career in wildlife conservation so she would n't have to deal with people			1
but working with wild animals in her native @entity6 has taught her that it is near impossible to prevent some vulnerable species coming into contact with human communities --- often with damaging consequences			1
as executive director of the @entity14 and chairman of the @entity16 , @entity12 now aims to reduce people - wildlife conflicts arising from these scenarios			1
" @entity19 is the only continent remaining on this planet that still has its full diversity of large mammals , " she says			0
" we ca n't afford to lose it			0
we 've always been able to co-exist with wildlife			2
" see also : uneasy truce between @entity27 and nature in some parts of the rural @entity6 however the durability of this ancient cohabitation has been tested in recent times			1
lions have become a particular problem for farm owners and @entity27 tribes , with whom they share the country 's vast savannahs , often preying on valuable livestock			2
this has led many farmers and rural communities to take matters into their own hands , in some cases killing whole prides they perceive as a threat			0
the use of pesticides such as @entity52 -- a tablespoon of which costs less than a dollar and is enough to kill a lion -- has become a particularly ruthless way of doing so			0
" @entity6 lions have reduced from about 15,000 about 15 years ago to fewer than 2,000 now , " explains @entity1			1
read related : ' @entity60 ' fights to save @entity19 's rainforests " and we know that probably 50 percent of that is attributable directly to the use of pesticides			0
" through dialogue and education programs , @entity12 is aiming to end these practices			1
she hopes to show rural communities how they can coexist and even benefit from their proximity to lions			2
" in many parts of @entity27 land now what we have are programs where people are rewarded for protecting wildlife			2
they are rewarded for keeping land open			0
" " they are trained so that they can participate in conservation			0
and they are given opportunities to get investors to come in and work with them			0
i really think that is the solution			0
" see also : last of the bush trackers a constructive and respectful dialogue with communities is highlighted by @entity12 as a key factor in achieving these aims			1
but it 's not just the human population who have been the focus of her organization 's educational efforts			2
the @entity102 graduate is also working to train wild lions so they know not attack livestock			2
she admits such a tactic may sound bizarre but believes it is essential to safeguard the big cat 's future in @entity6			1
" @entity109 are very , very intelligent animals			1
the reason why lions do n't prey on certain livestock in certain places is because they get hammered ( if they do )			2
" " there are ways that you can punish lions - and one of them is that you can put rock salt into a shot gun and shoot at them			1
it 's not going to injure them or kill them but it hurts like hell			0
they 're not going to come back because they do n't want to have that pain again			0
" @entity1 speaks with a passionate conviction on the benefits these training programs have brought			1
yet with more than 75 percent of @entity6 's wildlife inhabiting land outside of government protected areas , she admits there is only so much they can achieve on their own			1
it was for this reason that in 2007 she decided to join @entity143 , a bloggers network which connects conservationists and publicizes conservation work across the world			0
she has since taken over as the website 's chief executive and its popularity has soared			0
" initially all we were doing is raising money - it was every blogger for himself			2
and what we noticed , what i noticed , very early on is that many of the bloggers were telling the same story			0
" this observation helped @entity12 grasp that the blog platform could be used as a network tool for conservationists , helping them stay in touch as well as share their research			1
" all of the bloggers who were online on other predators ( such as crocodiles , jackals and birds ) are now sharing each other 's technology and learning from each other and exchanging , " she says			0
see also : beauty trumps beast in conservation efforts the power of communication emphasized by these exchanges has since acted as an inspiration for @entity12 's latest conservation project --- the creation of recorded oral history of @entity6 's biodiversity			1
" in my work , especially working with the local communities who are dealing with wildlife on a daily basis - i have been reminded constantly ( that ) most of the knowledge is maintained in the minds of the elders , " she says			1
" i hear these people lamenting that old stories are now gone and nobody can tell them			0
those elders are not literate - they ca n't record their stories			0
" by filming conversations with older tribes people and storing them on the internet , @entity12 aims to keep this cultural knowledge and experience alive			1
she also hopes a new generation of rural @entity6 's will gain a historic perspective on how to live alongside animals such as lions			1
" all they ( young people ) see about wildlife is killing livestock or destroying property , " she says			0
" ( but ) through these stories , children are able to actually discover this incredible culture and biodiversity that we have in @entity6 and across @entity19 , " she says .			2

@entity1 is a @entity6 conservationist aiming to reduce human - wildlife conflict
@entity109 populations in @entity6 have fallen *drastically* in the last 15 years
@entity12 is training lions and educating humans to get along better
