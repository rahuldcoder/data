-- you 're an @entity2 champion and you 've gone out at the top of your game -- so what next ? gold medal winner @entity7 is contemplating a future path which is being followed by many young people in her native @entity10 , and indeed around the world ... work experience			1
while the cyclist -- one of the official faces of @entity14 alongside fellow golden girl @entity15 -- is not exactly short of lucrative endorsement deals to tide her over in these times of economic uncertainty , she told @entity0 she has no idea what she is going to do next			1
" i 'm going to take some time out just to work out what , because obviously i 've spent my whole life turning left at speed			1
i think i need time to try lots of different things to find out what i enjoy , what i might be good at -- i do n't really know , " said @entity7 , who won silver in her final race in a @entity33 kit			1
interactive : see inside the @entity2 velodrome venue " i 'm going to use the contacts that i 've made through my success in cycling and just do loads of work experience to start with and then just see where it goes			2
" my only concern is not being able to find something that i can be equally as successful at			2
obviously you ca n't win @entity2 gold medals for every aspect of life , but i just want to be good at something -- i just want to be really good at something , that 's all i want			2
" @entity51 makes history as @entity10 wins first golds at @entity14 cycling has been @entity7 's life , and her success and good looks have made her a regular in glossy men 's magazines and a big draw for advertisers , but she says she 's glad her competitive days are now behind her			1
" it was just an absolute relief ; i will never have to do that ever again			0
going into the home olympics as the @entity2 champion and being named as one of the poster girls of the @entity2 , people were much more aware of me as an athlete and my profile because i was marked as one of the potential gold medalists , " the 31 - year - old said			1
" so it was difficult , it was really difficult to handle the pressure at times , and the expectation			0
so i would n't do it ever again ! " i think if the @entity2 were in any other country in the world i would have retired after @entity83			2
i was looking at continuing for another four years past where i 'd kind of decided i 'd perhaps had enough already			0
" four years is a long time to be living in this process , going towards a home games -- it 's a long time to be stuck in that kind of bubble			2
" @entity89 wins fifth gold after disqualifications mar women 's team sprint @entity7 was unable to retain her sprint title from @entity83 2008 , but bounced back from a disqualification in her opening event -- the team sprint -- to claim gold in the keirin			1
" of course i 'm sad that i could n't take away two gold medals			2
retrospectively standing here , i won a gold and silver medal at the @entity2 ; i 'm really pleased with that ! it 's history already			1
just move on and enjoy it really , " she said			0
@entity7 was beaten in the two - woman sprint final by @entity108 after having her win in the first ride ruled out , as the @entity111 reversed their podium placings from four years ago			1
" @entity108 and i have had a really fantastic rivalry over the past six years and i think i 'm a better sprinter because of her influence -- and i 'm sure she feels likewise , " she said			0
" we 've pushed each other on			0
if she had n't had been there i might not have achieved the level that i had			0
it 'd be hard to push to find another rivalry like it , especially in women 's sprinting			0
i think we did really push the boundaries there			0
" @entity89 becomes @entity10 's greatest olympian after taking sixth gold @entity7 , who has also won nine world titles , hopes that @entity132 cycling can continue its recent dominance			1
" we were lucky enough to have significant funding from @entity135 and @entity136 in the beginning because we had been successful and won the occasional medal through the likes of @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity89 , and it set the program up to develop and improve , " she said			1
" success brings success and i think that 's slightly coincidental almost , but then it 's created a kind of momentum that we 've just been rolling with ever since			0
" the hard work has paid off , and @entity7 can now reap the rewards -- whatever she decides to do next			1
" all the best things in life come through hard work and sacrifice			0
easy wins do n't mean as much , " she said			0
" it 's the ones that take the hard work and the effort , tolerance , the sacrifice , and the commitment , all the tough things , they 're the ones that you really remember and that really count			0
