-- anyone watching the @entity2 on tuesday night heard the number 4.5 million several times			1
" despite incredible odds and united @entity10 opposition , our president took action , and now we 've seen 4.5 million new jobs , " @entity5 mayor @entity4 , the party 's keynote speaker , said			1
@entity15 mayor @entity14 , who served as president @entity17 's chief of staff , and @entity19 gov. @entity18 , who followed @entity17 's november rival @entity20 as governor of @entity19 , both cited the same number			2
sights and sounds from the @entity2 it 's a big - sounding number , given the still - sputtering job market			0
so we 're giving it a close eyeballing			0
the facts : the number @entity4 cites is an accurate description of the growth of private - sector jobs since january 2010 , when the long , steep slide in employment finally hit bottom			1
but while a total of 4.5 million jobs sounds great , it 's not the whole picture			1
nonfarm private payrolls hit a post-recession low of 106.8 million that month , according to the @entity44 @entity43			2
the figure currently stands at 111.3 million as of july			0
while that is indeed a gain of 4.5 million , it 's only a net gain of 300,000 over the course of the @entity17 administration to date			1
the private jobs figure stood at 111 million in january 2009 , the month @entity17 took office			1
and total nonfarm payrolls , including government workers , are down from 133.6 million workers at the beginning of 2009 to 133.2 million in july 2012			0
there 's been a net loss of nearly 1 million public - sector jobs since @entity17 took office , despite a surge in temporary hiring for the 2010 census			1
meanwhile , the jobs that have come back are n't the same ones that were lost			0
are you better off ? according to a study released last week by the liberal - leaning @entity72 , low - wage fields such as retail sales and food service are adding jobs nearly three times as fast as higher - paid occupations			0
conclusion : the figure of 4.5 million jobs is accurate if you look at the most favorable period and category for the administration			2
but overall , there are still fewer people working now than when @entity17 took office at the height of the recession			0
full coverage of the @entity2 first lady seeks to reignite flame for the president @entity0 's @entity90 and @entity91 contributed to this report .			0

several speakers credited @entity17 with an improved jobs picture
the 4.5 million figure is based on private - sector jobs added since 2010
but the @entity44 *economy* is still down *400,000* jobs over @entity17 's *tenure*
