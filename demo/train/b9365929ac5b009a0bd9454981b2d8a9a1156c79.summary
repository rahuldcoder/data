all nations that hold large , aerospace expositions are on some level hoping that they will create the impression they have a modern industrial complex that puts them into the exclusive " club " of nations that build their own planes -- or at least some of the important components that go into them			0
most of the air shows in the international calendar -- @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 -- follow this template and they are commercially successful because they provide a forum for companies to meet with their customers and showcase what their products are capable of			0
@entity29 , which takes place in the southern @entity32 city of @entity33 this week , aims to showcase the @entity35 's emergence as a world - class aerospace and defense power and gives us a rare glimpse of @entity29 's home - grown military hardware			1
however , it is more like the @entity44 national air show , @entity45 , than other international events in that it is designed to impress the @entity32 government , @entity51 and military officials -- specifically the @entity52 -- rather than a vehicle to convince plane makers @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 or @entity58 of the opportunities available in the @entity32 market			1
commercial vs. military ask an executive working on one of @entity55 's fighter aircraft , military helicopter or missile programs about their importance to the corporate bottom line and he or she will tell you that @entity55 is an 80 % or more commercial company			2
the business of building big commercial aircraft like the @entity74 and 737s is what keeps @entity55 running , providing the economies of scale that allow the company to have a military aircraft division			0
without the commercial airliner business there would be no f - 15s or @entity84 being built at @entity55 's @entity85 , @entity87 plant			2
this is largely the case for almost all of the world 's major military aircraft manufacturers , but it 's definitely not the profile of @entity29 's aerospace industry			1
several major aerospace plants -- @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and others -- are almost completely geared towards the production of military aircraft			0
as yet , the country has no commercial airline programs that rival those of the @entity106			0
the 168 - seat @entity108 airliner being built by the @entity110 - based @entity109 ( @entity109 ) is supposed to someday be the nucleus of a fleet of @entity32 - built passenger aircraft , but its business model is one that @entity117 aerospace firms can only envy			1
the program is state - funded and launch customers are @entity32 state - owned airlines that are likely to have little choice but to purchase or lease the @entity108 , with first deliveries expected in late 2018			2
a number of foreign partners , including engine maker @entity125 , provide an additional financial safety net and it 's unlikely to meet the same difficulties as the @entity55 , which almost took the company to the brink of bankruptcy when it was first developed			0
" it 's a program that by definition can not fail , " said one @entity117 aerospace executive			0
" and it has the highest possible priority			0
it is clear that getting this aircraft off the ground is to the @entity32 what the @entity141 race to the moon was against the @entity144 in the 1960s			0
" stealth fighters the military arena is where @entity29 is likely to have the biggest impact			1
at least two new stealthy , next - generation combat aircraft -- the @entity150 and the @entity151 , are under development -- making the managers of western fighter programs like the @entity156 f - 35 look nervously at what the next decades of military challenges from @entity29 might entail			1
@entity29 's defense industry also boasts multiple lines of anti-ship , air - to - air and surface - to - air missiles -- the kind that give @entity141 , @entity170 carrier battle group commanders and @entity172 @entity171 planners pause and make them stop and think about what the viable scenarios are -- if any - for defending @entity162 in the event of the breakout of hostilities			1
however , most military aircraft firms can only survive financially if they have a fairly robust export market			1
several programs are based on the concept of shared costs among multiple nations because of the huge expense involved in developing modern - day defense technologies			0
so far , @entity29 is going it alone -- building fleets of fighters and bombers almost exclusively for the @entity188 --- with very few foreign clients			2
therefore , the biggest questions at this year 's @entity29 may be how long can @entity29 afford to be building military aircraft that are " for @entity29 only " and how soon will @entity192 realize that growing its export market is the only way it can continue to afford to maintain this massive military machine .			1

*airshow* @entity29 takes place in the southern @entity32 city of @entity33 this week .
show provides rare glimpse of @entity29 's home - grown military and commercial aviation hardware .
@entity29 is developing its own passenger *jet* and stealth fighters
@entity29 needs to grow export market if it wants to afford its massive military machine
