-- first came the dramatic discovery of the long - lost remains of @entity3 now , there 's the mystery of the coffin within the coffin			1
archaeologists working at the site in central @entity10 where @entity3 's body was found underneath a parking lot are currently puzzling over a sealed lead coffin containing the remains of a yet - to - be - identified person			1
the lead coffin was found encased in a larger stone coffin			1
the smaller coffin is intact " except for a hole at one end of the casket through which we could tantalizingly see someone 's feet , " said @entity23 , the fieldwork director at the site			0
new discovery just as exciting last year , archaeologists unearthed a body buried beneath a nondescript parking lot in the city of @entity30			1
in february , they confirmed the body was that of @entity3 , the last king of @entity10 to die on the battlefield			2
the news drew global attention and set off a debate over @entity3 's bloodthirsty reputation			1
archaeologists from the @entity38 , who have been toiling away at the site this summer , say the discovery of the double coffin is just as exciting			2
they only uncovered the lead coffin last week after eight people hauled the heavy lid off the stone coffin			1
but figuring out who 's inside looks set to be a much tougher task			0
" this inner coffin is likely to contain a high - status burial , although we still do n't know who it contains , " @entity23 wrote in a blog post			0
" no writing was visible on the coffin lid but it does bear a crude cross soldered into the metal			0
" there are three main contenders for the identity of the coffin 's inhabitant : a medieval knight named sir @entity64 of @entity65 , and two leaders of the @entity68 order , @entity69 and @entity64 of @entity70			2
beneath the parking lot the @entity30 site is where a church , known as @entity74 , once stood			1
over the centuries , the whereabouts of the friary 's remnants were forgotten , but it remained in the records as the burial place of @entity3 last year , experts began digging away at the area , which had taken on the less illustrious role of a parking lot			1
they went on to establish that it was part of the friary and that a skeleton , hastily buried in an uneven grave , was that of @entity3			0
the archaeologists who undertook a new dig this summer think the double coffin , located near @entity3 's grave , was buried during the 14th century , more than 100 years before @entity3 was killed at the @entity95 in 1485			1
of the coffin 's three likely occupants , @entity69 died in 1272 , @entity64 of @entity70 died in 1330 and sir @entity64 died between 1356 and 1362			0
' a first for all of us ' besides the puzzle of who lies within , the archaeologists were excited about the coffins themselves			0
" this was a first for all of us on site , " @entity23 said			0
" none of the team had ever excavated an intact stone coffin before , let alone a lead coffin as well			2
" they have now wrapped up their four weeks of digging at the site			0
the lead coffin has been taken away so that experts can carry out tests to figure out the best way of opening it without damaging its contents			2
but , @entity23 said , other parts of the friary that the archaeologists tried to investigate this summer appear to have been completely destroyed -- meaning that some of the site 's mysteries may never be solved .			0
