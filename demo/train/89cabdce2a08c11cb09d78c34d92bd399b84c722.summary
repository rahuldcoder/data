-- i never actually caught a glimpse of the @entity3 when i was young , but she was definitely real and in cahoots with my mom			1
this , due to the fact that i never woke up to find a @entity8			0
it seems , however , that the @entity3 had plenty of small bills			0
which , to be fair , seems the appropriate amount of prize money for literally doing nothing , save for having things fall from your head			0
and at least she was reliable			0
since then , i 've only allowed my adult self to believe in the mythical @entity23 , who comes in during the night and inspects your shower drain for treasure			0
so far , however , despite plenty of offerings , she 's failed to leave any cash under my pillow			1
even so , i still believe			0
but now there 's another fairy out there who is both very real and very reliable , and , for many adults , very welcome			1
basically , her job is to swoop into town and deliver free marijuana to people on the street			1
and she recently shared her generosity with @entity47 's @entity46 neighborhood			1
it was there over @entity50 weekend that she posted around 50 fliers on street poles that read : " these are tough times			1
take this weed and keep your spirits high			1
" taped to each flier was a tiny little nugget of weed			1
the postings were signed with the @entity61 handle @ danksyappleweed , which , for those of you paying attention , is a clever play on the name @entity68			1
though , their missions in life appear to be rather different			0
@entity68 is a beloved @entity73 treasure who , at the turn of the 18th century , introduced apple trees to many parts of the @entity73			0
@entity79 , on the other hand , helps inspire overstressed businessmen to go home , eat a bag of @entity83 and watch @entity85 's @entity84			2
which is equally as important			0
@entity79 's real name is @entity89 , and , according to her website , she is a 23 - year - old resident of @entity93 's @entity92 neighborhood			1
but she decided to spread her love on a recent visit to @entity96 , where marijuana is legal			0
@entity89 told @entity98 that , " it 's definitely easy to get it here in @entity47 , but not everyone has the money			1
" and she 's done it in the past			2
several months ago she said she provided free weed to people in @entity106 , where the feedback was positive			1
which is why , now , she 's much more open about who she is and what she does			2
the @ danksyappleweed handle even links to her personal @entity61 account , @ sleidi_yeni			1
of course , some people are concerned that the weed might fall into the wrong hands , like people under the age of 21			2
or , say , your parents , who like to try things now that they 're older			0
" @entity121 , i found this on the street today			2
i believe it 's legal marijuana			2
" " oh ! how does it work ? " " maybe it 's a suppository			2
get me some olive oil			0
" but @entity89 says that she 's careful about where her little wings take her , explaining , " i try to leave it in areas where i know the majority of the people are of age			1
" and the police do n't seem overly concerned either , telling @entity98 that it 's not a top priority			2
sadly , though , for people in @entity47 hoping to find some free heady nuggets , @entity79 tweeted on friday that her short visit to the @entity140 had come to an end , posting her message with a photo taken at what appears to be 420 @entity145			1
420 , of course , is a term the kids associate with marijuana , and a bit of modern slang that your parents will promptly mangle			0
" ok , @entity121 , it 's time			0
let 's 420 each other			0
" " yay ! here 's the olive oil			0
" follow @ @entity156 on @entity61			1
