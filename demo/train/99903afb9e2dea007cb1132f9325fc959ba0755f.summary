-- humans have driven to extinction four marine mammal species in modern times : @entity5 ´ s sea cow in 1768 , the @entity8 monk seal in 1952 , the @entity10 sea lion in 1970 and the baiji or @entity13 river dolphin in 2006			1
as you read this , we are on the brink of losing the fifth			0
the vaquita ( @entity20 for " little cow " ) , a small porpoise that lives only in the uppermost @entity23 , @entity24 , is the most endangered of the 128 marine mammals alive today			1
the vaquita , which some say looks endearing with its unique facial markings , is the smallest of all whales , dolphins and porpoises			0
the only way to prevent its extinction is if the @entity24 , @entity35 and @entity13 governments take immediate and coordinated action			1
new evidence presented by a team of international scientists , established by the government of @entity24 , shows that the vaquita is running out of time even faster than we thought			2
â € @entity45 population is very small and disappearing rapidly , with more than half lost in just the last three years			0
there were about 200 vaquitas a few years ago , and now a report presented recently to the @entity24 government by an international recovery team estimated that fewer than 100 remain			1
each year , about one in five vaquitas is drowned in fishing nets , both legal and illegal			2
this makes it likely that at least another 20 % of the population will be lost during the next fishing season , shrinking the total number even more			0
in light of this alarming decline , the international team has called for an emergency regulation establishing a gillnet exclusion zone for the entire range of the vaquita starting in september			0
the vaquita 's fate has also long been tied to the totoaba , a large fish that lives in the upper @entity23 as well			1
entanglement in gillnets set for totoaba was the primary cause that brought the vaquita to low levels by the mid- 1970s			0
@entity76 were overfished by the mid- 1970s , and the species was listed as endangered by @entity24 in 1975 , and by the @entity35 in 1979			1
massive illegal fishing of the totoaba has resurged in the past three years because its swim bladder is used as a very expensive traditional health food in @entity13 , especially in @entity81 and @entity82			1
dealers along the isolated beaches of @entity85 and @entity88 de @entity86 , two small fishing towns close to the @entity35 border , buy swim bladders from fishermen by paying several thousand dollars per kilogram			1
thousands of swim bladders are likely then smuggled across the border to the @entity35 and shipped to @entity13 -- where a kilogram can be reportedly worth much more on the black market -- leaving thousands of dead totoabas and tens of drowned vaquitas to rot			1
@entity24 authorities have acted to prevent the extinction of the vaquita			1
over the past five years , the @entity24 government , together with national and international foundations , has allocated more than $ 30 million to save this porpoise and support the livelihoods of the local fishing communities			2
most of this money has been used to compensate the fishermen affected by the creation of a vaquita refuge in 2009 and to assist those wanting to switch to safer fishing techniques			0
in february 2013 , the @entity24 government established a committee to advise president @entity117 on urgent measures to save the vaquita , led by @entity24 's secretary of the environment			2
four months later , in a bold move , the government mandated the elimination of all shrimp gillnets -- in which vaquitas are caught -- through their gradual replacement with a newly developed safer net within three years			0
but more needs to be done			0
despite these measures , the vaquita will be lost unless the illegal totoaba fishing is stopped immediately			2
it is now or never , and only high - level action can save this critically endangered porpoise			0
we urge @entity117 to stop the illegal fishing of totoaba by even stronger enforcement of the gillnet ban and to extend the refuge boundaries to cover the entire vaquita habitat			1
this means eliminating all gillnet fisheries within the expanded refuge and compensating the fishermen , while allowing for a transition toward new gear that catches shrimp but not vaquitas			0
we also urge @entity35 president @entity150 to take swift and decisive action through the newly created @entity152			2
the first immediate step is to scale up the already significant law enforcement efforts on transborder shipments of totoaba products			0
finally , we urge @entity13 premier @entity157 to immediately stop the illegal entrance of totoaba products			2
it is still possible to save the vaquita , but this is clearly the last chance			0
we call upon the governments of the @entity35 , @entity13 and @entity24 to take swift action to save this unique and beautiful species for present and future generations .			1

the vaquita , a small porpoise that lives in @entity23 , @entity24 , is near extinction
@entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 : fewer than 100 vaquitas remain
they say @entity24 , @entity35 and @entity13 governments must take swift and coordinated action
one way is if @entity24 stops the illegal fishing of totoaba , which often *ensnares* vaquitas
