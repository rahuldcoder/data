-- political systems in @entity2 are habitually characterised as nascent , highly personalized and fractious			0
elections are portrayed as democracy at an embryonic stage			0
as @entity8 head to the polls for the third time since the end of the civil war in 2002 , a different narrative is unfolding -- one of innovation and cutting - edge technology			1
an often overlooked aspect of the current electoral cycle in @entity8 is the use of biometric technology to capture thumb prints and facial features in the registration of voters			1
" credible elections start with credible voter registration , " remarked @entity24 , chief commissioner of @entity8 's @entity25 , during a presentation at @entity27 in @entity28 in july 2011			1
for @entity24 , a bloated or inaccurate voter register always has a negative effect on the electoral process			1
the optical mark reader system used to register voters in @entity8 's 2002 and 2007 elections was manual and only catered for one - off registration			1
voter identification cards , which relied on @entity40 photographs and a cold laminate seal , were vulnerable to tampering			2
biometric systems allow for the creation of a permanent electronic register which can be updated as new voters become eligible or existing ones die			2
they capture data unique to an individual , in addition to biographical information , and can identify whether someone has registered more than once by centrally matching fingerprints			0
in @entity8 , the system allows for people to move to a different electoral constituency without the need to re-register			1
biometric technology has been adopted to help address electoral fraud and increase the transparency , and credibility , of the electoral process			1

in 2005 , " @entity70 " in the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) used biometric technology to register more than 25 million voters ahead of the country 's first democratic elections in four decades			1
in @entity73 , some 65 million people had their pictures taken and fingerprints scanned in preparation for presidential and legislative elections in 2011			0
@entity79 registered more than 12 million voters using biometrics in 2012			0
in @entity85 , after protracted disputes over procurement , 15,000 biometric registration kits have arrived ahead of the elections scheduled for march 2013			1
@entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 have also used biometric technology to register voters			1
technology is only as good as the way it is deployed			2
in order to identify multiple registrations -- the principal merit of the system -- clean data must be submitted			0
finger prints and photographs must be clear and unsullied , which requires trained and capable staff			0
for @entity108 countries conducting elections with strict -- and limited -- budgets , sophisticated technology is not always the best option			1
in the @entity71 , it is questionable whether the advantages of a biometric over a manual registration system justified the cost -- a staggering $ 58 million			1
in @entity8 , the integrity of the electoral register has still been questioned by opposition parties who accuse the government of covertly registering individuals under the legal voting age and foreign nationals			1
acceptance of the voter roll ultimately depends on the political circumstances in the country			2
the greatest limitation of biometric voter registration is that it only counters the symptoms -- not the causes -- of electoral fraud			1
in @entity8 , there is no historical evidence of a deliberate strategy by any political party to rig elections through multiple registrations			1
all previous electoral registers have erroneously contained names of the deceased , the under - age and foreign nationals			2
but the most significant type of electoral misdemeanor has been physical stuffing of ballots and false recording of results by temporary election workers			2
both the @entity152 and @entity153 , when in power , have at times used their position to fund political campaigns and buy voters			0
political parties continue to organize and condone the intimidation of voters , often perpetrated by their youth wings			0
biometric technology offers little scope to tackle these transgressions			1
where electoral management is weak , manipulation of polls persists , regardless of the accuracy of the voter register			2
in @entity85 's 2007 elections , incumbent president @entity171 defeated his main rival , @entity174 , by a margin of 230,000 votes			0
the result contradicted opinion polls and the parliamentary ballot			0
allegations of systematic fraud and dysfunction , particularly within the @entity183 ( @entity183 ) , further discredited the elections			2
in the months leading up to the vote , president @entity171 replaced 15 of the 22 - person @entity183 with new commissioners considered to be his close allies -- none of whom had experience running an election			0
in the immediate aftermath of the vote , election observers were barred from entering tallying centers for 48 hours			0
election officials announced results from constituencies without supporting documentation from polling stations			0
deficiencies with the tabulation of votes were so great that @entity204 , chairman of the @entity183 , subsequently conceded that he " did not know who won the election			0
" expectations about technology 's role in elections must be realistic			0
biometric voter registration is not a " silver bullet " for eliminating fraud and electoral malfeasance			1
where institutions are weak , and perpetrators of electoral crimes are not prosecuted , politicians can find ways to achieve undemocratic ends			0
elections are more than just a technical exercise			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			2

many @entity108 countries using biometric voter registration , says @entity226
in @entity8 , biometric technology has been adopted to help address electoral fraud .
sophisticated technology is not always the best option , he argues
