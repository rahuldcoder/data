@entity2 , @entity3 -- " see what i 'll miss ? " princess @entity5 has been ambushed			1
the 40 - year - old leader of one of the @entity9 ' biggest sports finds herself fending off @entity11 paradressage rider @entity10			1
@entity10 wears around his neck the three gold medals he has won at the @entity14 in @entity2 , @entity15			2
as he leans in , medals dangling above the seated @entity5 's left shoulder , he announces : " now ma'am , i know you were quite good at showjumping and you might not have enough golds , so i thought i 'd let you have a feel of my gongs			1
" this is what the princess will miss when , in december , she reaches the end of her two terms leading the @entity28 , which governs world horse sport			1
one of very few women to occupy such a prominent position within the @entity9 movement , @entity5 is the subject of a warm , impromptu tribute from @entity10			1
" she 's brought inclusion from many countries that thought equestrianism was kind of elitist , " says the 10 - time @entity36 champion			0
" she 's kept us in the @entity9 by making sure @entity41 was such a success , and she 's modernized it			1
we 're not riders , we 're athletes			0
" her royal highness princess @entity5 carried her country 's flag at the @entity48 , where she competed as a showjumper at the age of 26			1
four years later she married sheik @entity51 , an equestrian endurance racing enthusiast			2
by 2006 , he had become the prime minister of the @entity54 and she had been elected to lead the @entity28			0
since then , much of her role has been to ensure equestrian keeps its place at sport 's top table			1
like wrestling , equestrianism claims roots extending back to the original @entity9 contested by the ancient @entity63			1
hence , when wrestling had a scare last year -- being temporarily voted off the program for @entity67 2020 , before reinstatement at a later @entity69 ( @entity69 ) meeting -- there may have been grounds for concern at the @entity28			0
" i believe there were very specific issues around the decision for wrestling , " says @entity5			1
" but i believe no international federation can consider that their place goes without saying			0
" very much the reason i came to the @entity28 , to try to modernize , was not the fact that my sport had got worse or gone backwards -- but other international federations had moved a lot faster than us			2
" that spirit of competition , that commercially cluttered landscape really does exist			0
the international federations compete for their place at the @entity14 just as much as the athletes do , and you have to guarantee that you really do have top sport			2
" @entity5 points to the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) as evidence that the @entity28 is doing its job			1
the latest edition of the quadrennial event boasted more than a thousand horses and riders , from 74 countries			0
the @entity28 claims more than half a billion people saw at least some action from the eight competing disciplines			0
" we 've never had a larger event than this , " she says			0
" the growth that 's happened over the past four years has made a marked difference			0
" there is a larger percentage of non-purist spectators in the stands and we are able to export our sport to a new public			2
our digital numbers have rocketed			0
our athletes are not just performing for the family any more , they are performing for the world			2
" all of that will be taken to the table by @entity5 's successor -- six candidates have come forward -- the next time the @entity69 calls on its constituent sports to fight for their future			1
@entity5 believes the @entity69 is most likely to look at removing one discipline from a large sport in order to accommodate a new , smaller sport in @entity67 and beyond			1
she thinks the @entity28 's battle lies in protecting its three @entity9 disciplines of dressage , showjumping and eventing			1
not that the @entity9 disciplines have always dominated @entity5 's eight years at the @entity28 's helm			1
endurance racing , a lower - profile form of equestrian sport immensely popular in the @entity138 , has provided the biggest threat to her presidency			1
the sport , in which horses can race a hundred miles in a day , has been troubled by a succession of doping scandals and concerns over animal welfare given the immense distance involved			2
@entity5 's position was called into question when her husband -- an endurance racing champion , an influential horse breeder and also the ruler of @entity154 -- received a six - month doping ban in 2009			1
she has since been accused of failing to vigorously pursue perceived shortcomings in the discipline 's approach to the wellbeing of horses			0
@entity5 , who handed oversight of endurance sport to colleagues over the conflict of interest involving her husband , says the issues are now being " managed very well " by the @entity28			1
" the sport has mainly come under criticism -- or the @entity28 has -- because it has n't moved fast enough , " she admits			2
" but on the other side of that , there are processes and procedures put in place for a good reason			0
" you ca n't have a knee - jerk reaction			0
you have to go through a period of dialogue and examine the situation from every side			0
they have been strong enough to do that and i think they 've done everything they can to protect the horses , and the integrity of the sport			2
" for her part , @entity5 says she wishes she had " had a lighter hand in some situations " in the earlier days of her time in charge			1
and as regards her unusual position as a leading woman in world sport , she believes examining gender equity only in the highest echelons of power means searching in the wrong place			1
" i think a lot is done to help women get to these positions but for me , what is missing is the avenue to come up through the grassroots , " she says			0
" for me it was easy			0
i had my career as an athlete , i rode in an @entity9 , then i had interaction with the national federations			1
i understood how it worked , and i went through a pathway			0
" what 's missing is that opportunity for women at grassroots level in other sports			1
while you had the opportunities at the top , there is still very much a vacuum in between			0
" i think in many ways it 's harmful that we have this permanent crusade , that we ' have to have women			0
' it makes it sound like you got the job because you 're a woman , rather than being able to do the job properly			0
" there 's a big difference between a person who merits doing the job and happens to be a woman , and one who gets the job just because she is			0
" the @entity28 's vote to replace @entity5 in three months ' time will determine the sport 's course for at least the next four years			1
with organizations associated with the @entity138 accounting for a number of equestrianism 's major backers , brought in through @entity5 and her connections , there is uncertainty as to how the financial future will pan out if and when her influence wanes			1
she , however , has already promised herself more time for two other interests in her life			0
in a statement turning down the chance to stand for a third term , the mother - of - two listed first her family and then humanitarian work , in @entity261 , as her new priorities			0
" i felt the president should only have an eight - year term and i still feel that is important , " says @entity5 , who had at one time announced her intent to seek a third term -- a move some considered " undemocratic " despite a majority of national federations backing the necessary rule changes			1
" as president , you have to do a 12 - hour day , it 's a full - time job , and it 's only really possible to do that for eight years until you do run out of ideas , " she says			0
" the sport is bigger than any international federation ever will be			2
sometimes , you get the feeling the world revolves around you			2
i 've always known that if we stop , the sport never will			2
it 's worth knowing that			0
