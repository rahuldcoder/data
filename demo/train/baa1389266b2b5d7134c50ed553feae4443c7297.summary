-- a few thousand @entity1 braved police and subzero temperatures to mark the first anniversary of @entity7 's @entity6 movement at an unsanctioned protest in central @entity1			1
while turnout was significantly lower than last winter 's rallies , which at one point attracted more than 100,000 people , those that came faced more serious consequences , including jail and fines of more than $ 9,500 -- nearly the average monthly @entity7 salary			1
hundreds of riot police cordoned off protesters who gathered next to the headquarters of the @entity7 's @entity21 security service and the former home of the @entity23 during the @entity24			1
@entity25 , the popular anti-corruption blogger , and @entity27 , a leftist activist , were detained by police immediately upon arriving , as were @entity29 , the socialite turned opposition leader , and her boyfriend the activist @entity33			1
all four were taken to a police station in the south of @entity1 but released within hours			2
police initially allowed the crowd gather peacefully , but after an hour began closing in on specific protesters who they arrested in often brutal scenes			2
an estimated 40 people were detained			1
the rally was the first major protest to not receive approval from @entity1 authorities , a sign of hardening relations between the city government and opposition leaders who refused to hold the rally at alternative locations suggested by the state			1
the demonstration is unlikely to breathe new life into the opposition , which has struggled to find direction since @entity58 's re-election in march			1
yet the turnout was arguably higher than expected given the threat of violence and fines			1
in the days before the rally , the state appeared to issue a warning to the demonstrators , announcing that a criminal investigation had been opened into mr @entity25 and his brother , and raiding the home of an associate of mr @entity27			1
" it was very scary for me to come			2
i cried this morning , " said @entity73 , 52 , who did not want to give her last name for fear of getting in trouble with her employer			2
she said once she had arrived at the rally she had become more confident , and had dared to affix to her coat lapel a pin that read " we were at @entity84			0
arrest me ! " -- a reference to the first major protest last year			1
" they say that there we do n't exist , but today we showed them that we do			0
their laws created by an illegitimate regime an illegitimate president are not an order for us			0
we are in charge here			0
we will come out on to the streets again , " she said			0
with no speeches or performances , the protest lacked the euphoria that coloured the demonstrations of a year ago			1
but those present insisted that were optimistic that change and reform would come , no matter how gradual			0
" over the past year , nothing particularly changed in politics			0
however , i think society has started thinking a bit about what needs to be done , " said @entity110 , a designer			0
" we need to change from within			0
i do n't know if there is a universal recipe			0
but we need to stop being indifferent and start thinking of things that are located outside our own apartments			0
" he added : " i see the faces here i usually see at the @entity121 or the @entity123 art gallery			0
it 's simply pleasant for me to chat here with these people who are clearly of the same mind			2
