-- since a temporary radiologic technologist was accused of stealing drugs from a @entity7 hospital and giving patients hepatitis c through infected syringes , troubling reports of his past have emerged -- casting a spotlight on the staffing industry as a whole			1
@entity14 worked in 13 hospitals in eight states between january 2007 and july 2012 , when he was arrested in a @entity18 hotel room " in an intoxicated state , " according to court documents			1
during that time he was employed by at least two staffing firms : @entity22 and @entity23			0
a surge of contract employees have entered the work force since 2009 , according to the @entity28 @entity27			1
businesses turned to staffing firms to handle their workload until they were more certain of their company 's future			2
more than 25 % of all new jobs created were temporary			1
the health care industry was especially affected by the economic downturn in recent years , said @entity38 spokesman @entity37			2
patients put off elective procedures amid hospital uncertainty over effects of the @entity43			0
" many health care professionals were seeking the flexibility that contract work allowed and were leaving hospitals with vacancies , " @entity37 said			1
" hospitals are turning to staffing firms to fill those vacancies to make sure they have the employees and staff and skills they need to ensure quality care			1
" approximately 1.7 % of the health care industry 's work force is now composed of temporary or contract workers , according to @entity38 data			1
that 's about 240,000 employees , compared to the nearly 14 million full - time health care workers in the @entity28			1
lack of evidence for man accused in hepatitis c case ? but those temporary employees play an important role in hospitals , @entity37 said			1
they fill in gaps in almost every field -- from nurses to physicians to med techs and administrators			1
while the hepatitis c infections have prompted concerns about whether contract workers are providing substandard care , research shows the opposite is generally true			1
a 2007 study conducted by the @entity83 at the @entity84 showed that temporary nurses are often better educated and more recently trained			1
@entity37 said hospitals that do not use temporary workers tend to have more negative patient outcomes because they have fewer staffing resources overall			1
still , the @entity14 case raises questions about the hiring process for both temporary and permanent health care workers			1
the case is not the first regarding a health care worker accused of harming patients during a career punctuated by troubling incidents			0
in 2005 , a @entity99 law took effect requiring health care professionals or companies to notify the state @entity103 of concerns or misconduct of health care workers who could endanger patients			2
it was passed after nurse @entity111 was accused of killing more than 20 people in the state			0
@entity111 reportedly was hired at a number of hospitals during his career in spite of what officials said was a questionable employment record			2
two years ago , @entity14 was fired from @entity120 in @entity121 when a fellow employee found him passed out in the men 's bathroom , according to documents obtained by @entity0			1
a few weeks later , he was working at @entity126 in @entity127			0
the staffing agency that employed @entity14 at the time , @entity128 , reported the incident to the @entity131 , according to a spokeswoman for the agency			1
the @entity131 said this week that they did not punish @entity14 because they did not have firsthand evidence of the 2010 incident			1
and the director of the @entity137 said officials stopped their investigation when @entity14 moved out of state			1
confused ? so are investigators , who are still working to sort out all the facts			0
@entity143 , vice president of business development for @entity144 , said that most staffing firms conduct a seven - year background check on potential employees			2
they will also do on - site drug tests and verify a candidate 's credentials			2
" we 're the legal employer of record , " @entity143 told @entity152 last week			0
" we insure them , we pay their payroll taxes			0
so while ' temporary ' or ' contract worker ' may have a certain reputation or connotation , we take them very seriously			2
... we take the full @entity162 responsibility as any direct employer would			0
" did registry know man accused in outbreak was earlier fired ? if there is a problem with an employee , hospitals are asked to report it to the staffing firm , he said			0
either party can take disciplinary action			0
" basically , it really falls down to the department level , " @entity143 said			0
" if they want to put it under the rug , things can happen			0
but it 's up to the department manager to report it to @entity162 should inform the staffing firm -- that 's the only way we 'll know			2
" one of the biggest problems , @entity143 and @entity37 agree , is that former hiring managers are often unwilling to disclose the reason for a past employee 's termination , creating holes in a background check			0
and it 's not just a problem for staffing firms			0
@entity14 was charged with stealing drugs from @entity197 , where he was hired as a full - time employee			2
" many employers are fearful of litigation and will verify employment dates only , " @entity37 said			0
" the system is only as good as the information available			0
" @entity152 's @entity204 contributed to this report .			0
