@entity0 -- go to the @entity6 website now because " it has improved , " with more people completing applications after a month of problems that botched the rollout of @entity12 , the official in charge of creating the online program told a @entity14 committee on tuesday			1
@entity15 , head of the federal @entity17 , assured the @entity18 the website will be fixed by the end of november , as promised by the administration			2
she also said the first figures on how many people have enrolled so far under president @entity25 's signature health care reforms would be available next week , meeting a mid-november deadline the administration has set			1
however , rep. @entity28 of @entity29 , the @entity30 chairman of the @entity31 , announced tuesday he issued a subpoena for the enrollment figures to be turned over by friday -- november 8 , about a week earlier than planned			1
administration officials expect the initial enrollment figures to be low , and @entity30 want them made public as soon as possible as part of their efforts to depict @entity6 as badly flawed			1
@entity15 noted the administration 's target for the end of november was 800,000 people enrolled , but it was not immediately clear whether that was a prediction for what the actual figure would be or referred to the number projected before the troubled website launch on october 1			2
she came under tough questioning from @entity30 opponents of the @entity50 , known as @entity6 , who insisted that the law itself is the problem , not the dysfunctional website for enrolling			1
@entity15 acknowledged she knew of troubles encountered by consumers that @entity30 senators cited , such as a man in @entity59 whose personal details turned up when someone else registered			1
in a terse exchange with @entity30 sen. @entity63 of @entity59 , @entity15 said her agency had reached out to the man who complained of the security breach			1
" we will find him and we will follow up on his questions , " she said , to which @entity63 offered to provide @entity15 with the man 's phone numbers			2
when she said her agency had the numbers , @entity63 responded : " he does n't think so , actually , because no one 's called him			0
" @entity15 replied : " well , we have a disagreement there			2
" later , @entity30 sen. @entity77 of @entity78 said that as of october 29 , only three people in her state had enrolled and she cited ongoing problems with the system that included providing consumers with incorrect information on available subsidies			0
" are you aware of this ? has it been resolved ? are we working on it ? , " @entity77 asked			0
" because the concern is that not only can people not get on to enroll , but if they do their subsidy calculations are incorrect			0
" @entity15 said her staff is aware of the issue and is " working on a fix to the system to correct the @entity78 issue specific to @entity78			0
" in one change to the federal website implemented by tech experts brought in to get it working , @entity15 said consumers can now view and compare health insurance plans online without registering for an account			1
obamacare : it 's about government 's role , future elections when the website came online on october 1 , it got overwhelmed by initial volume , and outside contractors working on the system blamed the requirement that people set up an account before they could view coverage options instead of being able to " window shop " without registering			0
" in the first few days that we went live , few consumers could create an account , " @entity15 said , repeating information she first provided at a @entity123 hearing last week			0
" we have now resolved that issue			0
users can successfully create an account and go through the enrollment process			0
we are able now to process nearly 17,000 registrants per hour , or five per second , with almost no errors			0
" tuesday 's hearing quickly generated the heated rhetoric of the continuing political battle over the @entity6 passed with no @entity30 support three years ago and upheld by the @entity138 last year			1
debunking 4 @entity6 myths : both sides get it wrong republicans who have made dismantling or repealing the law known as @entity6 a top priority focused tuesday on policy cancellations and higher prices facing some people , as well as the website woes that included difficulty logging on , error messages and lengthy delays			1
sen. @entity153 of @entity154 , the ranking @entity30 on the panel , said @entity25 broke his promise that people who like their previous plan could keep it			2
instead , he noted , polices are being canceled for those who buy their own coverage instead of getting it through their jobs or @entity165 and @entity166			0
@entity167 : @entity25 ' ca n't go back ' and change @entity6 vow " for these @entity170 the new promise is , ' if you want health care , go find it on a website the administration says wo n't be working properly until the end of november , ' " @entity153 said , calling it " an unwelcome @entity178 present			1
" he called for a proposal to allow people to keep current coverage if they liked it , a concept rejected by the @entity183			0
@entity185 chairman sen. @entity184 of @entity186 noted the benefits already in place from @entity6 , and he encouraged @entity30 to work on fixing problems instead of trying to undermine the program			2
what 's up with @entity6 and my health care ? @entity1 's @entity194 contributed to this report .			1
