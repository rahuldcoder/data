the ethics committee also found that @entity2 did not know of the contributions			1
nonetheless , he would be held responsible			0
" the committee does not find sufficient evidence to conclude , nor does it believe that it would discover additional evidence to alter its conclusion , that representative @entity2 had actual knowledge of the memoranda written by his staff			2
however , the report finds that representative @entity2 was responsible for the knowledge and actions of his staff in the performance of their official duties			0
" the powerful chairman of the @entity50 -- the lead body for writing tax law in the @entity6 -- will have to repay the costs of the trips , according to the statement , which did not indicate how much that would be			0
" i do n't want to be critical of the committee but common sense dictates that members of @entity59 should not be held responsible for what could be the wrongdoing or mistakes or errors of staff unless there 's reason to believe that the member knew or should have known , " @entity2 told reporters late thursday night			1
" and there 's nothing in the record to indicate the latter			0
" @entity2 told reporters he would meet with his lawyer to discuss the report -- which calls itself a service of " public admonishment " -- and how it is that he is being held responsible for his staff 's actions			0

but , when reminded that he had previously called for @entity2 to step aside , he said : " he should step aside until all this stuff in the ethics committee is resolved			1
" an aide to house speaker @entity95 said , " it 's to soon to say anything " regarding whether @entity2 will stay chairman of the committee			2
" we have received nothing from ethics , " said @entity100			0
a nonprofit ethics group voiced its opinion on the statement thursday , saying @entity2 should n't be the only person admonished			1
" the ethics committee 's decision makes no sense , " @entity108 in @entity110 's executive director @entity109 said in a written statement			2
" there is simply no reason for rep. @entity2 alone to be held accountable for taking this trip when a number of other members were also present			2

the five other @entity13 members investigated -- reps			0
@entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 -- did not " knowingly violate " rules because they were provided false information , the statement said			0
