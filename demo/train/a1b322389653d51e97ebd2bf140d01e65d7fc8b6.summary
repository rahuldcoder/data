@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was a busy weekend , but @entity4 was feeling relaxed			1
he was in boyish good spirits as around 150 contractors buzzed around his mansion and its acres of grounds , building a giant " @entity11 " sign on the front lawn and erecting a mobile stage that production company @entity14 says is @entity1 's largest			2
he mugged for the camera and joked " it 's another raid " as a helicopter flew overhead			0
the world 's most controversial internet tycoon was preparing to launch his site at 6:48am on sunday morning -- a year to the minute after his @entity1 mansion was raided and his old service was shut down by the authorities			1
( some press , including @entity26 , received an early look at the site			0
) @entity26 freelancer @entity29 spoke with @entity4 on january 18 at his mansion outside @entity0 , discussing topics ranging from @entity11 's business model to legal threats that may come back to bite his business			1
" i would have the same fears " in its heyday , @entity37 had around 50 million unique users -- none of whom have regained access to their files since the site was taken offline			1
we put the most obvious question to @entity4 first : why should users trust him with their data at all ? would n't it be legitimate for users to be spooked by @entity11 , and refuse to go near it ? " you are certainly right , " @entity4 conceded			1
" if i [ were ] a user of @entity37 , i would probably have the same fears			2
there will be users who chose not to work with us because of that , and that is unfortunate			0
" but @entity4 hopes that enough users will value the service he 's offering : all - encrypted storage that ca n't be opened by anyone — even the host			1
he knows there will be a lot of people coming to check things out in the weeks to come and first impressions matter			0
" there will also be a lot of users who just want to try this new service and see how good it is , " he said			0
" once they realize there is really no alternative to this service right now in terms of safety and privacy , i think there will be a lot of users who will use this			0
and over time , you know , when the service is live for a few months and people see these guys are still here , i think the trust will grow			0
" the jovial pre-launch atmosphere is only broken when @entity4 and his lawyer @entity91 are reminded that this week @entity93 prosecutors have raised the possibility of fresh charges if the @entity11 launch goes ahead — an act that could be interpreted as violating a key bail condition @entity4 signed in by affidavit : not to relaunch @entity11 , or a similar service			1
@entity91 angrily rejects the notion that @entity4 is violating bail conditions			2
" mr. @entity4 is working in consultation with top notch @entity105 defense counsel on bail compliance , " he said			2
" [ he ] is innocent , is presumed innocent , and is entitled to innovate and work in technology like any other innocent @entity110 especially when the @entity93 takes away all his assets and delays the extradition proceedings			0
" nothing in @entity4 's bail conditions or @entity93 law precludes his engaging in lawful business , including @entity119 and technology businesses , said @entity91			1
embracing even the " smallest , most unreliable " hosts the @entity11 business plan will be a distributed model , with hundreds of companies large and small , around the world , hosting files			2
a hosting company can be huge or it can own just two or three servers @entity4 says — just as long as it 's located outside the @entity93 " each file will be kept with at least two different hosters , [ in ] at least two different locations , " said @entity4			1
" that 's a great added benefit for us because you can work with the smallest , most unreliable [ hosting ] companies			0
it does n't matter because they ca n't do anything with that data			1
" more than 1,000 hosts answered a request for expressions of interest on the @entity11 home page			0
@entity4 says several hundred will be active partners within months			0
successful hosts will get paid @entity148 per month per server ; each server needs to supply 24 hard drives with 72 terabytes of storage and one gigabit of bandwidth , among other requirements			0
that 's all down the road , however			0
for now , @entity11 is launching with just one , professional , hosting operator — a subsidiary of @entity161 , based in @entity4 's home country of @entity163			1
@entity4 says he needed a rock - solid setup for the launch and an operator who could rapidly scale if traffic and hosting requirements suddenly go through the roof after the january 20 launch ( he had hoped to have a server rack operating in @entity1 for the launch as well , but says capacity on the @entity178 / @entity177 / @entity176 - owned @entity175 was prohibitive )			2
the @entity180 - based , @entity179 - listed @entity161 was one of the suppliers of infrastructure and hosting services to @entity37 before its 2012 take - down			2
according to the indictment , @entity37 was paying @entity161 around $ 1 million a month to lease " approximately thirty - six computer servers in @entity180 and @entity188			2
" it was a substantial contract , although one that was dwarfed by that of @entity194 - based @entity193 , where the bulk of @entity37 files were hosted , and are still stranded			1
@entity161 's fate was closely enough tied to @entity37 that its shares dropped 23 percent in a day after last year 's raid , from $ 19.20 to $ 15.43			2
by mid-march , however , the stock had rebounded strongly ; it closed recently at $ 24.11			0
having @entity161 back on board is a source of pride for @entity4 ; a major public hosting company has made a vote of confidence in his business plan for @entity11			1
he was about to go into further detail on @entity161 's hosting operation in @entity163 when his lawyer @entity91 — in @entity0 for the launch and sitting in on the interview — stopped him , citing security concerns if the specific location was revealed			0
launching the most lawyered - up startup in tech history the @entity11 business plan has been vetted by more than 20 lawyers across the @entity93 and @entity1 , @entity4 says — including those at @entity91 's firm , and @entity1 law firms @entity221 ( one of the largest corporate law firms in @entity105 ) and @entity225 ( an intellectual property specialist )			1
also on @entity11 are two independent lawyers capable of handling the most difficult work : queen 's counsel @entity229 ( often cited as the most expensive lawyer in @entity1 ) and @entity231 — a criminal lawyer who made his mark prosecuting cases for the police before " switching sides , " so to speak			1
" this startup is probably the most scrutinized by lawyers in the history of tech startups , " @entity4 claims			1
@entity4 says it 's inevitable @entity256 and music labels will " heckle " @entity11 " going by their past aggression ... they ca n't help themselves " ( and there was certainly a foretaste of possible trouble to come this week as @entity246 , which owns one of the two big radio networks in @entity105 , pulled ads for @entity11 from its stations ; an insider said the move followed pressure from music and movie advertisers )			1
@entity91 says anybody who comes after @entity11 has no case			0
" you have companies like @entity266 and @entity267 with @entity268 with materially similar technologies , and they are in business and they 're thriving — and @entity11 adds encryption , " he says			0
but does n't encryption add a sinister edge ? after all , encryption means @entity11 will be like the @entity275 bank of online storage services ; customers could easily use the technology to hide , say , pirated movies or child porn			1
@entity91 responds that many technologies have dual uses , but on balance provide more public good			0
that 's how the @entity286 stayed on the market , despite facilitating video piracy			0
the same argument applies to cloud computing as a whole , he says			0
for good measure , @entity91 also notes that former deputy homeland security advisor @entity294 wrote about encryption as a desirable feature for cloud computing services ( " you do n't really need to know where your data is			0
as long as you know it is safely wrapped in an at - rest encryption cocoon , you should feel secure , " the advisor wrote			0
) dotcom adds in that although other services do n't have a one - click encryption option built into their interface , the likes of @entity303 allow you to upload encrypted , password - protected files			1
@entity4 and @entity91 's arguments are well rehearsed and , on the face of things , have a solid logic			2
but @entity4 , by his own admission , says the apparent movie and music industry push against the @entity11 radio ads was an " emotional reaction " from the content industry			1
even with the best precautions , attempts to shut down @entity11 — and shut up @entity4 — are unlikely to stop			1

internet tycoon @entity4 launched a new file - storage and sharing site , @entity11 , on sunday
