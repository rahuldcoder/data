@entity0 -- in the months before @entity3 launched in 2005 , there were many skeptics , people who said it would fail because @entity3 's nascent luxury market was not ready for a world - class glossy magazine -- consumers there were just not sophisticated enough			1
at the time , the nouveaux riche were in the grip of bling fever , undiscerningly buying the most expensive goods they could afford in order to show off their success , according to a 2005 report by consultants @entity19			0
but where some saw a problem , @entity21 , @entity3 's editor - in - chief since 2005 , saw an opportunity : " we believed that @entity3 was going to experience a fast - changing period and consumers would change very quickly , " she tells @entity1			1
@entity27 's intuition was spot on			0
" by the time we launched the magazine , the readers changed again , so they embraced it immediately , " she says			0
the rest is history : the first print run of 300,000 copies sold out on the first morning and was reprinted twice			0
in the nine years since , the newest edition of the style bible , which is produced in 19 countries , has more than doubled its circulation to 640,000 copies			0
including web and tablet users , it reaches some 1.2 million people and now accounts for almost 10 % of @entity3 's international readership outside the @entity47			2
@entity27 -- the youngest of all the @entity3 editors - in - chief , including @entity49 and @entity50 -- has been a driving force in the development of @entity3 's fashion industry			1
she has nurtured local models and designers , encouraged top talent from the fashion world to visit and advised luxury brands			1
brands still do n't get it today , most luxury retailers will tell you that their most valuable customers are from @entity3			1
they are still the biggest buyers of luxury goods globally , making 29 % of all purchases , according to consultants @entity68 , despite a cooling @entity70 economy and an official crackdown on corruption and extravagant gift - giving			1
@entity27 says today 's luxury market is " very multi-layered ( and ) complicated , " adding that most international brands are failing to connect with @entity70 consumers			1
" what ( brands ) do n't realize is how quickly things change , from month to month , from day to day even ... one thing i keep stressing is the multi-layered reality of the market now ... you can not have one single strategy for the country , " she says			2
luxury analyst and author of " @entity90 : why the @entity94 has only just begun , " @entity91 says luxury brands have been caught out by @entity3 's luxury consumers because they are young digital natives			1
" the speed ( of change ) comes from the fact that youth is driving sales			0
the @entity70 luxury consumer is in their 20s , compared with the @entity103 who is in their mid- 30s and in the @entity47 older			2
" young people in @entity3 are all over blogs and forums , chatting all the time			2
brands are finding it difficult to adapt because they are not very tech savvy , " he says			0
from bling to complexity @entity27 likens the early @entity70 luxury consumer as being like a starving person given food after a long time			1
" people did not have anything in their house , they did not have designer handbags , they did not have outfits			0
so when the country opened and luxury products started to flood in ... they tried to grab anything they could and at that time people were not sophisticated , or educated enough about luxury , about fashion ... of course they went for something they could easily understand , which was symbols , what we call logos			1
" what 's causing confusion among many international brands is how quickly many @entity70 have passed through that phase -- particularly the top tier of market consumers who were at the bling vanguard a decade ago			1
" ( they ) now start to have confidence , they have proved themselves by now ... now they actually feel that the most important is not ' how other people look at me , ' it 's ' how i feel			0
' " this has had a dramatic impact on their buying habits and where before they might have gone for a logo handbag , they are starting to explore different brands and designers and creating personal style			0
@entity162 adds that five or 10 years ago , most @entity70 luxury consumers only knew @entity165 and @entity166 handbag brands			1
" now they know 20 brands , " he says			0
new concepts both @entity27 and @entity162 agree that brands need to make their offerings in @entity3 more sophisticated			2
" ( it 's time to ) refine the concepts , refine the retail infrastructure , bigger stores , more products , edgier concepts , " says @entity91			1
he cites as an example @entity166 in @entity180 , which caters to very wealthy @entity70 tourists , middle - class tourists , middle - class @entity180 shoppers and @entity184 -- wealthy @entity180 women who do n't work			2
" @entity166 is opening very big stores , which have a vip salon to cater to someone who wants to feel special and drink champagne			0
next to the salon there are the ( cash registers ) where you have more of a volume approach , " he explains			0
@entity27 says that while it was very easy to describe @entity70 consumers 10 years ago , it 's not so easy today : " there are people ( who are ) very sophisticated , they travel around the world , they know everything ... and people who are really new into this world of luxury			1
" segmenting is something that @entity27 has been doing at @entity3 for some time			2
" the demographics of the consumers have become much more sophisticated and complicated , " she says			0
" what we do well ... is to structure the magazine in a way that can speak to the top tier ( of ) discerning consumers , but also appeal to a large , large number of readers ... new to all this and weave everything together in a seamless way			0
" and with a publication like @entity3 on the scene , @entity70 luxury consumers are only going to get more refined			1
where are the most beautiful people ? @entity226 private jets , two maids and a personal chef : the pampered life of @entity232 's pet cat front - row politics , no - show models : what really goes on backstage at a fashion show			0

@entity3 editor - in - chief @entity21 : luxury market " multi-layered "
global luxury brands are failing to connect with @entity70 consumers
bling and status symbols not all that concern @entity70 consumers now
luxury analyst : it 's time brands refined products , *introduced* edgier concepts
