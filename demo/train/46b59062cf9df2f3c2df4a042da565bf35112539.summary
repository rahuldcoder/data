-- in most of the old @entity2 , there was a moment at the end where the cowboy rode away			2
he 's delivered justice , empowered the townsfolk and ended the crisis			0
the good guy knows he will be needed elsewhere			0
it 's mythology , of course ; the historical @entity13 was bloody and brutal and often without honor			0
but there were still a lot of people who hoped the cowboy icon was precisely the self - image @entity20 gov. @entity19 was realizing as he took the stage to make an announcement about his " exciting future plans			1
" but this is not the scene where the cowboy rides away			0
it 's a bit more like the one where he refuses to leave the saloon and has to be thrown out onto the street			0
in spite of promoting his monday event in @entity36 for a week , @entity19 did n't speak in any detail about his plans			1
democrats and progressives had a bit of excitement , however			0
the governor said he was not running for re-election to the state 's top political job			2
it will be 18 months before @entity19 leaves office after a 14 - year tenure as the longest - serving governor in @entity20 history			1
and that final year and a half and what he 's going to do with it is where @entity19 exercised his skills at being politically vague			1
which is why pundits tend to say @entity19 is hard to predict			1
since the day he switched political parties under the tutelage of @entity61 almost a quarter century ago , @entity19 has been an extreme conservative who gave away hundreds of millions in taxpayer money to corporations			1
and when the tea party metastasized into @entity20 politics , he walked his conservatism over to the right edge of the flat earth			0
his lust for guns and @entity73 and his hatred of abortion rights and gay rights make him a strong @entity78 primary candidate among the activist voters , but an unlikely voice for most of @entity81 seeking a president in 2016			2
but he 's still going to try , bless his heart			0
@entity19 will use his remaining time in office to raise money			1
the signal for this was the site of his announcement , which was a @entity92 plant outside @entity36			0
the manufacturer 's chief executive reportedly has given @entity19 more than $ 680,000 since he became governor , and @entity92 received millions in tax abatements and a $ 10 million grant from the @entity98 , which has disproportionately awarded money to generous @entity19 campaign donors			1
an @entity101 and the @entity103 and @entity102 of @entity20 offered the same fiduciary delights for @entity78 business leaders that are believers in @entity19			1
in fact , the institute 's operation was so political all of the top scientists drawn to the project resigned and the district attorney in @entity114 launched a criminal investigation			0
when the district attorney was arrested on a driving while intoxicated charge , however , @entity19 vetoed funding for her unit , which was investigating his potential misconduct			1
it 's good to be king			0
and he kind of is in @entity20			0
no one should expect anything new out of @entity19			1
he will keep traveling the country annoying other state leaders while talking about jobs in @entity20 and acting like he persuaded @entity73 to pour dinosaur wine into our soil and then seduced @entity134 tech companies into moving where real estate and labor are less expensive			0
@entity20 has always been a job engine because of natural resources , weather and people , not politicians			0
no mention will be made by @entity19 of the fact that a large number of jobs lured to @entity20 using taxpayer money are minimum wage , nor will he talk about how @entity20 is 50th in the percentage of population with a high school diploma , or how it 's first in the nation with 28.8 % uninsured			1
the governor will keep arguing against @entity153 regardless of the fact it insures 3 million more @entity156 and reduces the uninsured overall to 12 %			2
do n't expect him to detail , either , that his state is 50th in per capita spending on health care , 51st in benefits for the @entity163 , and , even though he is pushing abortion restrictions , @entity19 will certainly not let anyone know he presides over a state ranked 50th in the percentage of women receiving prenatal care in their first trimesters			1
and if his leadership has been so inspiring , why is it that @entity20 is also last in the percentage of the voting age population that actually votes ? instead , look for @entity19 to associate more publicly with the @entity174 , a conservative state think tank founded by one of his biggest donors			1
he 'll try to gin up a little gravitas on issues , work on keeping three items in his head at one time , and launch a @entity183 that he can use to support conservative candidates in 2014 , and then call upon them for returned favors when he runs in 2016			1
the two @entity186 associated with his previous presidential stumble have about $ 500,000 already , and @entity19 has been consistently skilled at leveraging the governor 's office to raise cash for his political fantasies			1
the @entity20 governor has a good life			2
he 's already drawing his $ 7,698 a month pension from the state , and his $ 150,000 salary , living in a beautiful mansion in downtown @entity114 , and traveling on jets with an entourage of security and sycophants			0
but that 's nothing compared with being president			2
so , no , the cowboy is n't riding away			2
he 's hanging around the saloon			0
and trying to get another drink			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			2

@entity212 : @entity19 says he wo n't run for governor again but was vague on future plans
@entity210 : @entity19 will run for president , even though his extremism is out of step
@entity19 will use remaining time in office to raise money , launch @entity183 , he says
@entity210 : he gave millions to corporations but has *abysmal* record on education , health care
