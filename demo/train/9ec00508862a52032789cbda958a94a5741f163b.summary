editor 's note : @entity4 contributor @entity2 is a best - selling author whose current book is " when we get to @entity7 : a journey through @entity9 in @entity10			1
" " tumbling tumbleweeds " have been romanticized in song , but they 're no fun in some parts of the @entity9 ( @entity4 ) -- " do we like them ? " @entity18 , a game and fish commission employee in @entity21 , @entity22 , repeated the question back to me as if i had proved my lunacy by asking it in the first place			1
" do we like tumbleweeds ? " he said			1
" no one likes them			2
they 're not like in the cowboy movies			0
we consider them garbage -- worse than garbage			0
there is nothing to treasure or cherish about a tumbleweed			0
" we were talking about tumbleweeds because of a theory i had been pondering : in this country , because of the immediacy of news , it seems as if everyone from one coast to the other is worrying obsessively about the same thing at the same time			1
you name it : the banking meltdown one day , the feared floods in @entity51 , the next ; the forced ouster of the head of @entity54 one morning , followed soon after by the street demonstrations in @entity59 during the @entity60			0
we all tend to fret together about one crisis at a time ; undoubtedly there will be something new for all of us to be nervous about together before sundown tonight			1
so the goal here was to come up with something utterly unlikely -- something that , in 2009 , you would n't think would bother people -- and find out if it does			0
that , just picked at random , was the test case			0
" they can be a pretty big problem out here , " said @entity74 , a code enforcement inspector in @entity75 , @entity76			1
" when the wind is right , they 'll pile up right to the roofline of a house			0
seriously -- people ca n't see out of their windows or even easily get out of their homes			0
" there was something instructive , even ( in an off - kilter way ) comforting , about learning this : the affirmation that , in this increasingly monolithic country , there are still local vexations that override the breaking news bulletins on the national networks , that people in one pocket of @entity9 are routinely dealing with forces that people a few hundred miles away are blissfully unaware of			1
just hearing about it makes life seem somehow more life - size			0
" i meant what i said literally , " @entity104 said , continuing on his pinned - in - the - house - by - tumbleweeds theme			1
" they are big and prickly -- they can blow for hundreds of miles , sometimes all the way from @entity113			1
they go until the wind dies out or they run into something			0
that 's when people can have piles of them pressing against their homes -- when the tumbleweeds stop there			1
" tumbleweeds , if you have n't thought about them in years , may seem like a gauzy memory from old @entity129 movies , a nostalgic high - plains symbol of desolation and loneliness			1
there was that campfire song by @entity135 and his group , the @entity137 ; once you think of the lyrics and melody again , you ca n't get it out of your head : " see them tumbling down / pledging their love to the ground / lonely but free i 'll be found / drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds			1
" but in the 21st century ? in our connected - by - broadband , addicted - to - cell phones , technologically tethered nation ? tumbleweeds ? as something to be concerned about ? " they 're ugly and nasty , " said @entity153 , the county manager of @entity154 , @entity155			1
" they can make our roads impassable			0
you can see 12 - foot - high , chain - link fences with tumbleweeds piled all the way up to the top			1
they 're very flammable -- toss a cigarette , and you have a big fire			2
" tumbleweeds are more than a nuisance out here			2
we 'll get complaints from people who ca n't even get out of their own driveways because the tumbleweeds have them hemmed in			2
" tumbleweeds are mainly a plague in the @entity178 and @entity179 : certainly not dire on the level of , say , a national security issue , but a perpetual pain in the neck			1
they 're a gnarled and unpleasant - looking plant , useless as a crop or nutritionally ; they dry up , separate from their roots and blow across the land , spreading seeds			0
they 're thorny , are often painful to the touch and can grow as big as trash bags -- it 's not uncommon to see tumbleweeds 4 feet in diameter rolling speedily along			1
as @entity199 , who lives west of @entity200 , @entity76 , and who was concerned about people just heaving errant tumbleweeds off their property and thus onto nearby lawns , wrote in a letter to the editor of her local newspaper : " they are prickly and strong			2
... i have been guilty of tossing them into the street and sending them on their way			0
please do n't fight with your neighbors			0
" the people of the @entity9 , though , are nothing if not resourceful			1
just as you may have been unaware that tumbleweeds are a contemporary problem , so you may be heartened to learn that , as always , where some people see bad news , others see opportunity			1
" i thought there might be some money in tumbleweeds , " said @entity227 of @entity228 , @entity229			2
she runs a company called @entity234 ( its motto is " if they do n't tumble , we do n't sell them ! " ) , and she said she has found a steady mail - order market for tumbleweeds			2
" personally i 'm not fond of them , but apparently some people are , " she said			0
" they 're just big , rolling weeds			2
but people order them for wedding decorations			0
people order them for dances			0
servicemen say tumbleweeds remind them of home			2
i 've taken two orders already today			0
" finding them is not a challenge : " they just roll by the house			0
" she grabs them , puts them in boxes and mails them off			0
and , to answer your question before you can ask it : $ 25 for a large tumbleweed , $ 15 for a small			0
before we leave this topic so we can all return to more conventional news , a word from @entity269 , director of weed and pest control in @entity272 , @entity113 : " i 've seen people here who have gone away for a two - week vacation , and when they come back , there are so many tumbleweeds in front of their house that they have to chop their way to the front door			1
" so , mr. @entity269 , is there one stirring and inspirational parting message you 'd like to convey to people ? " just that tumbleweeds do n't have any redeeming features , as far as i 'm aware of			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : national issues such as *economic* crisis *dominate* news
@entity2 says that we quickly move from one crisis to the next
@entity2 : still there are *regional* concerns that never get a big *spotlight*
some parts of the @entity9 are plagued by " tumbling tumbleweeds "
