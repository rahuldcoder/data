@entity0 , @entity1 -- the passage of health care will certainly rank as one of the major political achievements of recent decades			2
legislation that will eventually extend health care coverage to more than 30 million more @entity9 , greatly expand the number of options that citizens have when purchasing health care , bring healthy citizens into the pool of the insured and thus lower costs and create important regulations on health care companies will be remembered as one of the biggest domestic policy changes since the @entity22 of the 1960s			2
while most attention will focus on president @entity26 for pulling off a herculean task that eluded many of our great presidents , @entity9 house speaker @entity24 emerges from this battle as the real powerhouse in @entity33			1
she has pursued a clear ideological agenda but through pragmatic political tactics			0
like the late sen. @entity36 , she stands for something , yet knows how to round up votes			0
since the 2008 election , @entity24 has been the most reliable leader @entity40 have had			1
she has delivered on almost all of the legislation that the @entity43 sent to @entity44 , even as her colleagues found themselves frustrated by a @entity46 that seemed incapable of governance			1
at three critical points in the health care debate , @entity24 delivered			1
first , she assembled a center - left coalition around the original @entity43 bill in november by pushing through a controversial amendment related to abortion that brought moderate democrats on board with the legislation			1
second , when many @entity40 , including top presidential advisers such as @entity58 , contemplated breaking up the bill after the @entity60 election , @entity24 stood firm and defended holistic reform			1
she " kept the steel in the president 's back , " @entity62 rep. @entity62 told @entity63			0
finally , in the past week she displayed the kind of vote - gathering skills that have been displayed by legendary figures such as speaker @entity70 of @entity71			1
from the start of @entity26 's presidency , @entity24 has argued that @entity40 should focus on maintaining partisan unity rather than on achieving bipartisan coalitions			1
she has implored her colleagues to act with confidence rather than out of fear			0
her goal has always been to find ways to keep @entity40 together rather than bringing republicans on board			2
in an era where partisan polarization makes true bipartisanship impossible , this is the most effective and realistic approach for @entity40			2
her philosophy echoes the beliefs of another powerful leader who said : " show me a nation without partisanship , and i 'll show you a tyranny			0
for all its faults , it is partisanship , based on core principles , that clarifies our debates , that prevents one party from straying too far from the mainstream and that constantly refreshes our politics with new ideas and new leaders			0
" that was from a farewell statement by @entity80 majority leader @entity80			0
although @entity9 tend to focus on the presidency and give credit to the office for what does or does not happen , we often ignore the central role that @entity44 plays			0
during the 1930s and 1960s , legislators were essential to the success of the @entity115 and @entity22 , often pushing presidents @entity116 and @entity117 in directions they were too scared to take			0
rather than the cartoonish caricature that @entity80 often use of @entity24 as a left coast , left - wing fanatic , she is something much more powerful -- and threatening to their party			1
when @entity36 died , many @entity40 wondered who would take his place as the party 's deal - maker			1
now they have their answer			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity133 .			2

after @entity40 lost 60 - vote @entity46 majority , some *wanted* to scale back health bill
speaker @entity24 fought to keep the bill comprehensive , says @entity133
he says she combines strong ideology with ability to amass needed votes
@entity133 says @entity24 has emerged as powerful *dealmaker* for democrats
