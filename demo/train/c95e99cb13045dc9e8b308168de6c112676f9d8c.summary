there , under a makeshift canopy , volunteers wait for their turn to begin training			2
when they are called , they are put into formation where they march -- sometimes out of step -- and practice shooting			0
they get about a week to 10 days of training , @entity37 said			2
much has been made about whether it 's enough training to take on the seasoned @entity39 fighters , who have had significant success in battling @entity25 president @entity65 's forces			1

@entity1 's military spokesman , maj. gen. @entity74 , details the deaths of @entity39 fighters during military briefings televised near daily , but he says almost nothing about @entity1 security force casualties			1

take the report about fighting at a military base south of @entity11 : @entity39 fighters launched an attack sunday against the base at @entity90 , on the outskirts of @entity92 , where an infantry brigade is based			1
at least seven soldiers , all new recruits , were killed and 15 were wounded , according to police officials			0

still , volunteers come by the hundreds to @entity0 to train			0
" i can assure you that volunteers came from all of @entity1 's provinces , and a few were underage but we convinced them to change their decision and return to their families , " @entity37 said			1
while @entity37 said recruits are not asked about their religious affiliation , the majority are @entity16 who answered the call put forward by @entity112 , the country 's top @entity16 cleric			0
among them is 23 - year - old @entity115 , who left his job as a taxi driver in @entity11 's @entity118 to take up arms			1
" this is my first day here , and i am ready to be deployed to the field , even to the front line , if that 's needed , " he said as he sat on a wooden bench waiting to be called			1
as @entity37 detailed the training for @entity2 , he was interrupted by a man in his 70s who reminded him that he has come to the training center every day for much of the last two weeks			0
" when will it be my turn , " he asks @entity37			0
" when @entity133 wills , " the colonel tells him			0
" on the street corner in @entity11 , @entity26 praises his son 's decision to volunteer			0
he does n't know where he 's been deployed			0
" no , i am not afraid for him			0
