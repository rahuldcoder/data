-- " we looked at ports in @entity2			0
we looked at street signs			0
" in the end , comedian @entity6 and his wife decided to name their son @entity9			1
they simply liked the sound of it , and most people will agree it 's far better than @entity16 , @entity17 or @entity18			0
this was 4Â½ years ago , but the former " @entity21 " star still loves to talk about his son			1
in 2009 , he even published a book about becoming a first - time dad called " yes , you 're pregnant , @entity25 ? " " we finally got the pacifier away from him , " @entity6 says of @entity9			1
" and now we 're potty training him			0
it would 've been easier to get the pacifier away from him if we taught him how to pee on it			0
" @entity6 describes himself as a hands - on father but admits , " it 's because i do n't work that much			1
" in that sense , he sort of sounds like his character , @entity36 , on @entity38 's " weeds , " a pot - smoking , former cpa - drifter with a pretty much nonexistent moral compass			1
however , as you 'll see and hear in our recent video interview , @entity6 and @entity36 are really nothing alike			1
" i have a lot of hobbies , and i have a lot of friends , " he says			0
" and i 'm not so insecure as @entity36			2
" they have even greater differences , but everyone still loves @entity36			2
for all his faults and failures , fans just ca n't get enough of the self - centered , shamed city councilman of fictional @entity57 , and he has become , perhaps , @entity6 's most beloved character on tv			1
this , from the man who spent a decade on " snl , " " entertaining viewers with @entity62 and mr. @entity63			0
these days , @entity6 is mostly keeping busy on the road with his stand - up act , and he plans to record a new one - hour special next year			2
beyond that , @entity6 simply remains ... legendary .			0
