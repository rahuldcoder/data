-- newer threats , such as pirate skiffs chasing freighters and desperate regimes mining harbors , have intensified the @entity7 's need to handle an array of " real - world " scenarios			1
meeting the challenges requires robust training on the use of sonar and explosives and the testing of gear that will protect shipping and counter traditional naval forces			1
the environmental impact of those technologies resurfaced friday with the publication of new estimates on the number of whales and dolphins off @entity27 and @entity28 that could die or be injured as a result of their use			1
the @entity34 @entity33 , in a draft study , said the use of sonar and explosives in those regions from 2014 to 2019 could cause up to 200 deaths and 1,600 injuries each year , including hearing loss , among marine mammals			1
the death estimates are based on the use of explosives or animals being struck by ships			2
but , @entity7 officials told @entity0 , those numbers -- a result of mathematical modeling -- are worst - case scenarios			1
" we believe ... with our mitigation efforts and the @entity7 commitment that those injuries and mortalities will be none , " said @entity51 , @entity33 senior environmental planner in @entity53 , @entity27			1
the @entity59 requires such data before it issues permits the @entity7 needs to conduct training and exercises			1
the @entity7 contends improved mitigation efforts , including the posting of lookouts and the practice of turning sonar power down or off when marine mammals are spotted , are making a difference			1
and , they said , today 's sailors are boarding vessels with environmental sensibilities			2
" they have the awareness the entire nation has , " @entity51 said			2
" and they bring it with them			2
" at a time when officials expect training and testing to likely increase in the deep , blue waters off @entity27 and @entity28 , environmentalists are keeping a wary eye on the @entity7			1
" i am not saying they are not well - intentioned , " said @entity86 , staff attorney with the @entity87			2
" but i am not sure their choices make them the best environmental stewards they could be			2
" the debate over sonars and whales has gone on for years			2
it centers on balancing the need to defend the @entity34 , while safeguarding its natural resources			2
it has also played out in court			2
in 2008 , for example , the @entity34 @entity101 lifted sanctions placed on the @entity7 over its underwater sonar testing			1
environmental interests , said chief justice @entity106 for the majority , " are plainly outweighed by the @entity7 's need to conduct realistic training exercises to ensure that it is able to neutralize the threat posed by enemy submarines			1
" @entity86 argued that the use of lookouts aboard @entity7 ships is not fully effective			1
" most marine mammals do n't spend much time at the surface , " he said			0
" when they do , you better have good weather conditions to see them			0
" @entity86 points to other consequences from the use of sonar and other acoustic sources off @entity28 and @entity27			1
government estimates for 2014 to 2019 indicate there may be about 2 million cases of temporary hearing loss among marine animals , @entity86 told @entity0			0
" marine mammals use hearing the same way we use sight " to find food , he said			0
" this kind of constant barrage and harassment is not a recipe for healthy populations , " @entity86 added			0
@entity51 challenged @entity86 's assessment , saying the 2 million number includes all behavioral and " temporary " responses , such as an animal turning its head , stopping feeding or moving out of the area			0
" the animal fully recovers , " @entity51 said			0
the report also indicated monitoring in 2009 - 2010 off @entity27 and @entity28 showed 162,000 marine mammals with no evidence of distress or unusual behavior during @entity7 activities			1
the older @entity7 analysis , for 2009 - 2013 , estimated about 110 marine mammals would be injured or killed in @entity27 and @entity28			1
@entity51 and @entity159 , environmental impact statement project manager with the @entity33 , urged caution when making comparisons between the studies			2
they cited additional research , a wider geographic area , updated computer models and different study areas in the new analysis			0
" it is clearly not our intention to harm any animals , " @entity51 said			0
three , perhaps four , dolphins , died in 2011 during a @entity7 training exercise involving underwater explosives near @entity177			1
the area had been cleared but dolphins moved in too late for divers to be able to turn off a charged timer , @entity159 said			0
" the dolphins were at the wrong place at the wrong time			0
" after the incident , the size of the mitigation area was increased			0
" we learned from this lesson and moved forward , " @entity159 said			0
" the limited impacts we are expecting are to individual animals , not to the species population , " he said			0
@entity86 , of the @entity87 , said the @entity193 is trying a different approach			0
the agency is identifying marine mammal " hot spots " with a high population density , @entity86 said			0
the @entity7 , he said , should do a better job of not using disruptive sonar and explosives in such zones			1
@entity51 said the @entity7 already identifies areas for special protection , including a humpback whale sanctuary off @entity206			1
crews also are aware of calving season and areas			0
the @entity7 is seeking public input over the next 60 days as it moves forward in the permit process			1
" we encourage the public to engage with us so we can do a better job , " @entity51 said			0
" this document is very robust , very defensible and people will see that			0
" while the @entity7 's chief mission is defending the country , it has " a long history of environmental stewardship , " @entity51 said			1
@entity0 's @entity222 contributed to this report .			0

@entity7 releases data on estimated whale , dolphin deaths off @entity27 , @entity28
it says it is trying to mitigate the losses
environmental group says more needs to be done
*military* training exercises are expected to increase
