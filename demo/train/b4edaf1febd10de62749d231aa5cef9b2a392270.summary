-- several prominent leaders in the @entity2 said monday that @entity3 have a moral responsibility to combat climate change -- a major shift within a denomination that just last year cast doubt on human responsibility for global warming			1
" we can do better " in responding to climate change , some members of the @entity2 say			2
forty - six influential members of the @entity2 , including three of its past four presidents , criticized their denomination in a statement monday for being " too timid " in confronting global warming			1
" our cautious response to these issues in the face of mounting evidence may be seen by the world as uncaring , reckless and ill - informed , " the statement says			2
" we can do better			0
" the @entity2 , the largest @entity24 denomination in the @entity25 , adopted a resolution last year urging @entity3 to " proceed cautiously in the human - induced global warming debate in light of conflicting scientific research			1
" the resolution said " many scientists reject the idea of catastrophic human - induced global warming			1
" on monday , however , dozens of @entity2 leaders expressed a different view			1
" there is general agreement among those engaged with this issue in the scientific community , " their statement says			0
" a minority of sincere and respected scientists offer alternate causes for global climate change other than deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels			0
" the signatories pledged to do their part to fight global warming " without any further lingering over the basic reality of the problem or our responsibility to address it			1
humans must be proactive and take responsibility for our contributions to climate change -- big and small			0
" the signatories include @entity66 , president of the @entity2 since 2006 ; @entity67 , president of the convention from 2000 to 2002 and @entity69 , president of the convention from 2002 to 2004			2
the group posted the statement on its web site			0
the signers of " a @entity75 on the @entity76 " acknowledged that some of them were skeptics at first			0
" some of us have required considerable convincing before becoming persuaded that these are real problems that deserve our attention , " the statement says			0
" but now we have seen and heard enough to be persuaded that these issues are among the current era 's challenges that require a unified moral voice			0
" the @entity2 's 16 million members make up roughly 7 percent of the @entity25 adult population , according to the convention and the @entity91			1
the competing and evolving views on climate change within the @entity2 mirror a debate that has played out among members of the theologically like - minded @entity96 , an umbrella group that represents about 30 million people in 45,000 church congregations , including many baptist congregations			2
its @entity101 policy director , the rev. @entity100 , has pressed for years for more action to combat climate change , saying in a recent documentary that " to harm this world by environmental degradation is an offense against @entity108			0
" his advocacy raised eyebrows given that global warming sometimes conjured " impressions in people 's minds of being liberal , democratic , left wing , big government , tied to population control , all these kinds of things , " @entity100 told @entity0 last year			1
several conservative evangelicals signed a letter in 2007 urging the association to rein in @entity100 or encourage him to resign			0
the signers included @entity124 of @entity125 and @entity126 , a former presidential candidate and president of @entity25 values			2
" we have observed that @entity100 and others are using the global warming controversy to shift the emphasis away from the great moral issues of our time , notably the sanctity of human life , the integrity of marriage and the teaching of sexual abstinence and morality to our children , " their letter said			1
" the issue ( global warming ) should be addressed scientifically and not theologically			1
