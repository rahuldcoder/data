rescue crews combed the high - altitude paths and passes of the popular @entity14 region , as well as the neighboring @entity16 district for trekkers missing for nearly a week			2
nine stranded @entity19 tourists were rescued thursday , as well as three @entity20 and four @entity21 who were pulled to safety , according to the @entity24			1
the group said it deployed helicopters to rescue hikers stranded by snow , floodwaters and avalanches unleashed along the popular @entity5 trekking trails by heavy snow tuesday			2
regional administrator @entity33 told @entity34 that 14 trekkers were now known to have died near the iconic 5,416 - meter ( 17,770 - foot ) @entity36 in @entity37 , the highest point of the popular 21 - day @entity40 trek			1
the bodies include those of @entity19 , nepalis and @entity44 , he said			1
even as the total death toll climbed from the 17 reported wednesday , @entity33 warned that there are chances of finding more people dead or lost around the pass			1
a @entity6 army team made it up to 16,000 feet on thursday -- still short of the pass -- on the side of the mountain where the 14 bodies were found			1
' this is the dangerous part ' friday 's search efforts were concentrated on the other side of the pass , which falls in @entity16 district , " this is the dangerous part , " @entity33 said			0
there has been no contact with the remote area even by phone , he said			0
one @entity19 was rescued from near the pass thursday			1

@entity14 is far and away the most popular of its trekking areas , with some 90,000 trekking there in 2013 , according to @entity95 , tourism officer of @entity96			2
" there have been incidents of trekkers being killed in snowstorms , landslides and avalanches in the past but not as many as this year , " @entity95 said			2

" trekking is adventurous in nature after all			0
" october is the best month of the year to do the @entity40 trek , meaning more visitors than usual may have been in the area when unusually heavy snow caused by @entity112 in eastern @entity21 came down monday and tuesday			0
