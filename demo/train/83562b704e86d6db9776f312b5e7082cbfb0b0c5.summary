@entity0 -- two teeth that appear to be human were discovered by investigators friday in a thicketed and remote oceanfront stretch of @entity5 , according to police			1
the teeth were found near where a human skull was uncovered in @entity10 last week , and are the latest discovery in an ongoing search that has found 10 sets of human remains since december			1
from those remains , authorities have identified at least eight bodies			0
@entity10 executive @entity18 said friday 's find takes authorities a step closer to bringing " this killer to justice , " though he added that a medical examiner will have to determine if the teeth are indeed human			1
earlier friday , police spokesman @entity25 cautioned against media speculation regarding a possible killer , saying that the two sets of human remains found in @entity10 have yet to be classified as a criminal homicide matter			1
" anybody who is making a profile ( of a possible killer ) , its pure speculation , " @entity25 said in reference to the human remains found in that county			1
his words were in sharp contrast with those of authorities in neighboring @entity43 , where eight other sets of human remains have been found			1
that county 's police commissioner , @entity46 , said the remains found in @entity43 could be the work of a serial killer or killers			1
@entity46 first mentioned the possibility of a serial killer in january , when the total number of bodies found was four			1
those bodies were all women prostitutes uncovered within a quarter - mile of each other , according to @entity46			2
" common sense tells us it 's not a coincidence , " @entity43 detective lt. @entity59 said at the time			0
since then , authorities have discovered six additional sets of human remains in the two counties			1
they appeared to be in various stages of decomposition , police said			0
officials have yet to identify the latest sets and have provided few other details regarding the discoveries			0
friday 's find of the teeth came as police fanned out across brush and bramble - filled areas that border a @entity5 highway in a remote area near the @entity81			2
earlier this week , police divers scoured the sea floor with metal detectors and long poles during an underwater search for evidence in the possible serial killer case			2
" it could be a piece of jewelry , it could be a piece of apparel , anything of interest , " said @entity89 , the @entity43 marine deputy inspector			0
that search was in the same area where the first four bodies were uncovered in december			2
the area , near private docks in upscale @entity100 , is also where 23 - year - old @entity101 was last seen in may of last year			0
the missing @entity104 woman 's disappearance prompted the initial search			0
she was reported missing after attending a private party at a home in the @entity100 community			0
no sign of her has been found			0
police said @entity113 , like the other four women found in @entity43 , had advertised prostitution services on internet sites such as @entity116 .			0
