@entity0 -- casualties from wednesday 's wave of attacks across @entity6 rose to 93 people dead and 312 wounded , the @entity2 said thursday , making it the deadliest day in the country since the @entity10 withdrew its troops in december			1
the attacks were mostly aimed at @entity14 pilgrims trekking and driving to a shrine in @entity0			1
the scale of violence left some stunned			0
" i am deeply shocked and utterly dismayed by the despicable attacks across @entity6 today that have claimed the lives of scores of @entity6 , including many pilgrims , and have injured dozens more , " @entity18 , the @entity20 secretary - general 's special representative for @entity6 , said wednesday			1
" the scale of the violence is disturbing			0
i urgently appeal to the government to address the root causes of the violence and terrorism that are causing so much suffering and pain to the @entity6 people			0
" the @entity10 @entity33 in @entity0 said the attacks " killed and wounded innocent men , women , and children of all religious and ethnic backgrounds			1
" " the perpetrators of these cowardly terrorist attacks must be brought to justice and we will support @entity6 's @entity44 in this effort in any way we can			0
" @entity6 prime minister @entity47 met with @entity48 , @entity10 vice president @entity50 's national security adviser , in @entity0 on thursday			1
the two men discussed @entity10 - @entity6 relations , but it is unclear whether they talked about the attacks			0
en route from across the country , including the @entity14 heartland of southern @entity6 , pilgrims have been headed to the @entity60 shrine in the @entity62 neighborhood of @entity0			1
the event culminates saturday when the faithful commemorate the death of @entity66 , one of 12 revered imams in @entity14			1
the violence sparks fears of a renewal of the fighting between @entity72 and @entity14 in @entity6 in the last decade , a longtime animosity intensified by the @entity10 invasion of @entity6 and the toppling of the @entity77 regime			1
most people in @entity6 are @entity14 , but under @entity77 , @entity72 held a great deal of power despite their minority status			0
@entity14 gained the upper hand politically after @entity77 was overthrown by a @entity10 - led invasion in 2003			2
@entity72 felt disenfranchised amid that political backdrop , and many backed insurgent actions against the government			0
as a result , @entity72 - @entity14 violence exploded in the 2000s			2
the violence eventually ebbed as the war wound down , but ever since , there have been spurts of high - profile attacks			1
one of the deadliest days recently came on january 5 when at least 60 people were killed in attacks that again targeted @entity14 on a pilgrimage			2
but wednesday 's violence eclipses that day and is reminiscent of last decade 's sectarian strife			2
more than 100 people died in three separate actions as recently as 2009			0
a string of suicide bombs in december of 2009 left 127 people dead			0
and two car bombs outside @entity0 's province building and the @entity107 in october of that year killed 160 people			2
in august , two truck bombings and three other blasts left at least 100 people dead			0
@entity112 's umbrella group in @entity6 , a @entity72 group that has targeted @entity14 , claimed responsibility for those attacks			1
@entity1 's @entity116 contributed to this report .			0
