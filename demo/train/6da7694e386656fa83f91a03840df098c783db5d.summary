it really works well , and it has made an impact on a hospital very close to my home , the @entity60 in @entity61			0
so it 's great to see this working its way back to the area where i 'm from and helping so many kids , " @entity97 said			2

" i 'm not a golfer , but i do love to come race a race car for charity			2
i 'm proud to be a part of it and honored to be a guest here as a racer			0
