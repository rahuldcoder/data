-- when video of @entity5 's deposition surfaced this week and went viral , most of us were amusedâ € ” especially lawyers			1
( you can watch some of it here )			0
as he answers questions for a battery case involving his bodyguard and a photographer , @entity5 is glib and tries to parry the deposing attorney 's questions			1
if we could see off camera , we might see @entity5 's attorney subtly shaking his head in frustration			1
counsel would know what @entity5 may not want to " beliebe " : you only hurt yourself at a deposition when you bicker with the questioning attorney			1
to those luckily unfamiliar with depositions , it may have looked simply like @entity5 was being a defiant celebrity in an interview			1
but a deposition is no interview , and treating it that way is to invite catastrophe			1
@entity5 made a number of missteps typical for beginners			1
here 's what he should have known : what is a deposition ? testifying at a deposition looks a little like testifying at a trial			2
there are lawyers , a stenographer , questions and answers			2
but a deposition is not a trial			2
at trial , you can tell your story and convince a jury of your position			0
a deposition , on the other hand , is the other side 's only opportunity to find out what 's in your mind , lock your story in writing , and have it ready to bash you over the head with if you testify inconsistently at trial			1
generally , the more your opponent gets you to talk at a deposition , the more information he or she has to use against you at trial			2
an argumentative witness like @entity5 is a dream come true for his opponent			1
smile , you 're on camera : most depositions are not videotaped			1
it 's expensive and the costs do n't always justify the benefits			2
but @entity5 's opponents want him on camera , preferably preening and pugnacious			1
watch , for example , when he answers : " guess what ? guess what ? i do n't recall			2
" had the deposition only been recorded in a transcript , on paper that looks pretty innocent			2
but watch the oozing hostility on the video , and his dramatic " i do n't recall " might play to a jury as " i am conveniently forgetting negative evidence			2
" his opponent scored points deposing him on camera			0
you ca n't answer if you do n't know the question : @entity5 can be seen interrupting questions to answer			1
a witness should always wait until the question has been completely asked			0
first , someone is typing the questions and answers into a transcript , and interruptions end up looking like someone spilled @entity104 letters onto a piece of paper : @entity107			2
a witness should only answer the question asked , lest he volunteer information to help the other side			2
and , if a question has n't even been finished yet , a witness ca n't possibly limit the answer to the question asked -- he does n't know what the question is yet ! best practice ? wait until the question is complete ; pause and ask yourself if you understand the question ; if you do , ask yourself if you know the answer to the question ; if you do , only answer the question asked			2
depositions are not soapboxes : at a deposition , you will never " show up " the other side 's lawyers			1
you are not there to show them the error of their ways and win them over			0
they will not turn to colleagues and announce : " you know what ? after hearing this story , i think we 're on the wrong side of justice here			2
we should pack up and go home			0
thanks for your time , mr. @entity5			1
" objection to the objection : @entity5 can be heard warning the lawyer not to ask about sensitive subjects , like his possible relationship with other celebrities			1
elsewhere , he actually ( and hilariously ) interposes his own " objection			0
" at a deposition , the lawyer asks the questions , not the witness			2
the witness does n't decide what 's relevant			0
at a deposition , " relevant " subject matter is any question " reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence			0
" it does n't have to be admissible evidence , just calculated to possibly lead to admissible evidence			0
therefore , virtually any question is arguably proper			0
that 's why grizzled veterans of " deps " routinely acknowledge that , practically , they can feel like a fishing expedition			0
@entity5 may not like the questions , but he takes his chances with the judge if he refuses to answer			1
arguing requires additional words : do n't argue with the lawyer , @entity5			1
the rules of evidence are always skewed in favor of the attorney , and against the witness			0
witnesses are often smarter than the lawyer , but the rules simply give the lawyer an overwhelming advantage			0
moreover , arguing takes more words than simply answering yes or no. @entity5 's opponent benefits from each additional word @entity5 says , because that 's part of another sentence the singer needs to testify consistently with at trial			1
we all know it 's nearly impossible to tell the same story twice , but a good cross-examiner will make minor inconsistencies from an earlier deposition look like a flawed memory , or worse , paint the witness as a liar			0
in text form , sarcasm does n't read like sarcasm : sarcasm is using words to indicate ( sarcastically ) the opposite of what you really want to say			0
sarcasm really comes out in the way you say something			0
q : did you shoot the sheriff ? a : oh yeah , sure			0
see ? without the benefit of the voice and visual elements of sarcasm , on paper someone just admitted to shooting the sheriff , when maybe they wanted to be sarcastic			0
for the most part , you 're on your own : @entity5 's lawyer actively objected to protect his client , but deponents often feel like their lawyers are n't getting involved enough			1
for the most part , lawyers can not			0
the rules of discovery seriously limit how much @entity5 's attorney can object			1
he can object " for the record , " which means the judge can later decide if the answer is ultimately admissible at trial			0
of course , some questions are so outside the realm of relevance or civility that the attorney has to intervene			0
the questions about @entity5 's personal relationships could potentially fall into this category , because they appear to stretch the boundaries			1
it was n't all terrible : in fairness to @entity5 , he did some things right			1
he made it clear when he did not understand a question			0
that 's critical , because if he answers a question without fully understanding it , the court will later on assume he understood it when he answered it			0
@entity5 appears on the video to really think about the meaning of the questions and his answers			1
if he could carve out his other behavior , in some respects , he 's not half - bad as a deponent			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity262 .			1

@entity262 : @entity5 is *petulant* and sarcastic in a videotaped deposition
@entity262 : @entity5 should know this is not an interview : interruptions just hurt his side
@entity262 : depositions are not soapboxes ; you are n't there to match wits and bicker
@entity262 says all you say in a deposition is *fodder* for lawyers , so the less you say the better
