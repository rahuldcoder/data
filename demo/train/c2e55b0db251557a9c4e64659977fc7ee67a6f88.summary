-- it was an international who 's who of horse racing super powers : @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , the @entity9 and a resurgent @entity10 were all represented in the start gate of this year 's @entity12			1
as the field entered the turn for home , the grey and maroon racing silks of sheikh @entity15 nudged ahead of early pacemaker @entity19 -- and from then there was only going to be one winner			1
five lengths clear , @entity8 jockey @entity23 had time to ease up past the winning post , flicking his whip in the air in celebration aboard @entity29 , later named horse of the year for 2013			1
it was a home success for the adoring @entity33 public , but the victory yet again highlighted the newest force in global horse racing			2
@entity29 's success is merely one headline in a myriad of horse - racing moments coming thick and fast for @entity41 , a country with the third richest natural gas reserves and a population of just two million people -- but a gdp of $ 183 billion			1
the first in the sport dated back to 2011 when the stallion @entity49 won the @entity50 at the first attempt by owner @entity52 , cousin of @entity15			1
it was a suitably dramatic event for anyone to make their mark ; after a photo finish , the stewards took nearly three minutes to decide the outcome and award a prestigious victory to a horse that had cost @entity52 a mere $ 150,000			2
to highlight that fact , just a week after october 's @entity12 triumph , @entity15 -- brother of @entity41 's emir @entity65 -- left attendees at auction house @entity67 aghast by paying $ 8.25 million for the daughter of 2001 @entity71 winner @entity70 , a world - record fee for a yearling filly			1
and then in november , @entity15 announced further plans to make his mark on the sport by appointing @entity78 -- who runs @entity81 's prestigious @entity80 stud -- as racing adviser to his @entity84 operation , with the ambitious stated view to be " one of the leading forces in thoroughbred racing			1
" veteran champion @entity89 , meanwhile , has become @entity15 's retained jockey after his split with @entity93 - owned @entity92			1
the rise of @entity41 as a global player in the sport of kings has no previous equal			1
not even @entity98 's @entity92 enjoyed anything like this level of success so soon despite plowing millions of pounds into it from day one			0
what is truly remarkable is the speed with which the gulf state has got to this point			0
the first major player was @entity52			0
he watched horse racing on tv for the first time in 2008 , attended his first meeting at the start of 2010 and , by april of that year , had started buying horses			1
@entity52 's first move was to give @entity116 bloodstock agent @entity115 a relatively paltry Â£ 1 million to invest			2
" he was looking for someone to put his toe in the water , to have a feel for it , " @entity115 recalls			1
" we had a huge amount of success in a short period of time			0
" in fact , in his first year of racing , @entity52 's horses won 26 % of the races he entered -- and that success paved the way for others to follow			1
" when he won the @entity50 with @entity49 it showed to the rest of @entity136 that things just were n't down to the @entity98 family , " @entity115 adds			2
" so there has been greater investment from @entity52 's brothers and obviously @entity15			1
" @entity52 's hunger for knowledge is extraordinary			0
he 's an extremely good judge of horses and he 's utterly fascinated , he 's made some very good decisions and had some great results , particularly considering the scale of investment			1
it 's not the case of the person with the most money wins			0
if it was , horse racing would lose its magic			2
" @entity52 has spent admirably but also wisely , pushing his acquisitions through @entity155 and @entity156 to feasible limits while still ensuring both are money - making businesses			0
after his early successes , @entity52 has increasingly tried to take more of a back seat in horse racing , allowing his brothers to come to the forefront , but along with @entity15 he remains the integral figure for his country			1
as well as the @entity12 victory with @entity29 , @entity15 has also enjoyed widespread success as an owner over the past 18 months			1
his portfolio of victories in 2013 includes @entity172 in the @entity173 at @entity174 as well as @entity175 in the @entity176 at @entity177			0
but as of last week , he has announced his intention to up the ante and increase his stable of 110 horses in @entity81 and @entity8 with @entity84 , a breeding operation set up by his brother @entity65 back in 1992			2
" our ambition is to have the most successful horse racing operation in the world , " says his spokesman @entity183			2
" when he entered the race , he wanted to be number one			0
he does n't accept being second			0
" @entity52 has also thrown his financial support behind two up - and - coming @entity81 trainers , @entity192 and his wife @entity193 , by setting them up at @entity195 with @entity115 ' help			0
@entity192 earned his license in january before enjoying his first winner with only his second runner a month later			2
he has since enjoyed a first @entity174 winner with his first runner there , @entity203 , plus a first group classification success with @entity205 at @entity206			2
@entity192 was first approached to take over @entity195 on the day his twin sons were born , and describes the tie - in with @entity52 as " all quite fortuitous			0
" " he 's massively passionate about the sport , hugely knowledgeable with it too , " @entity192 says of @entity52			0
" he 's a great person to work with and he 's really taken a chance on us			0
" you could n't ask to train for a better person			0
he loves animals and he loves sport , and he 's very supportive			0
but also he leaves us to get on with the nuts and bolts day - to - day stuff			0
" i hope he 's pleased			0
he 's certainly very optimistic about what we 're doing			0
he 's trying something new with us and we 'll see what happens			0
" at a time when @entity41 is in the sporting spotlight for the wrong reasons , with difficulties in the lead - up to the @entity234 , its entry into the horse racing fraternity has almost virtually been one of positive stories and the sport 's often close - knit community has well received these relative newcomers			1
it has also invested heavily in sponsorship , agreeing a 10 - year deal for the @entity12 in june 2010 , via the @entity243 ( @entity244 )			2
@entity244 also sponsors the 35 - race @entity245 , which culminates at @entity174 in the richest day in the @entity116 horse racing calendar with $ 4.7 million at stake			1
both lucrative sponsorships are aimed at putting @entity41 on the global map -- its latest attempt to use sport to improve its political sway			1
as @entity52 said at the start of his horse - racing venture : " it opens a lot of doors for us			0
sport unites the world , and that 's the vision of @entity41 .			1

relative newcomers to flat racing have taken the *traditional* super powers by *surprise*
@entity41 royal family first " *dipped* their toe in the water " in 2010 with near immediate results
@entity275 winner @entity29 is among the horses owned by the @entity41
sheikh @entity15 recently broke the @entity279 record for a yearling at $ 8.25 million
