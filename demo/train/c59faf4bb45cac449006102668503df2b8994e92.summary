-- the transition of science - fiction gadgets into scientific reality is seldom a simple process			1
more than 20 years on from the @entity6 trilogy and a breakthrough in hoverboard technology is still eagerly anticipated -- not to mention anything close to " @entity12 's time - traveling @entity11 car			2
but a new research body at @entity14 is aiming to bridge the gap between the lab and the most evocative inventions of the sci - fi genre			1
the @entity19 and the imagination ( @entity20 ) , which opened last month , will bring sci - fi writers into collaboration with inventors , engineers and technologists			1

corporations , including computer - tech behemoth , @entity41 , and publisher , @entity38 are already involved with the group 's early endeavors			2
" it 's an unusual thing for a university to do because it brings together a variety of different people who would n't usually work together , " says @entity20 director , @entity45			2
" we want to create conversations that cut across all these different boundaries and get people thinking in a more expansive way about their own work			0
" one of the center 's first projects has pitched acclaimed sci - fi writer , @entity60 , with @entity14 professor and structural engineer , @entity63			1
@entity60 is a chief proponent of the dark sci - fi genre , @entity65 , and has spoken publicly and passionately about arresting the malaise he believes has stunted the imagination of @entity69 science and science fiction			1
the pair have so far probed the viability of a 20 - kilometer tall steel tower that could launch vehicles into space more efficiently			0
while this may not be a project that can instantly deliver practical results , the hope is it will encourage scientists and sci - fi writers to think big and pose each other challenging questions			1
" this is really what the whole @entity19 and the imagination is all about , " says @entity63			2
" the writers of science fiction or any writers for that matter are very different from the usual crowd that i hang with			1
" see also : scientists to stimulate human brain inside supercomputer " people from outside engineering will toss in very basic questions that specialists will often forget to ask , in this case ' how high is the tallest structure you can build ? ' " " it was incredibly interesting for me to consider the open question : ' what can you do with structures ? ' which i had n't really done before			0
" as it turns out , @entity63 's concludes that a 20 - kilometer tall tower is possible but would likely never be built due to the resources required ( some 55 million tons of steel , he says ) and financial costs involved			2
for companies such as @entity41 however , solutions that can be immediately put into practice are not as important as the dialogues and ideas these inter-disciplinary interactions encourage -- for now at least			0
the technology giant is working with the @entity20 to create the @entity120 , a new website designed to engender expert conversation on the future of subjects such as sustainability , energy and education			0
" in science fiction writing and the conversations , you can explore how the technology can impact in both positive and negatives ... showing us the kinds of future we want and [ just ] as importantly the kind we do n't want , " says @entity128 , @entity41 's mystically titled technology evangelist			1
" it also allows [ us to play ] with the moral and ethical consequences for the technologies as well , " @entity12 adds			0
other projects in the pipeline at the center include a plan to design the ideal city of the future , drawing contributions from writers , engineers and urban designers			0
in the coming years meanwhile , the talents of other artists including musicians , painters , actors , dancers and those in the performance arts will be harnessed , predicts @entity45			0

" for authors , having the contact with [ scientists ] allows for further refinement of their ideas into something that is potentially more workable , " says @entity184			0
some writers may already undertake such processes by themselves but by formalizing this relationship , @entity184 believes a more fluent and rewarding conversation between science and sci - fi will arise			1
like @entity63 , @entity12 and @entity45 before her however , @entity184 tempers expectations by stating that the practical implementation of these ideas will likely have to wait			0
" i do n't think you can guarantee that the project will come up with ideas that can be put towards venture capitalists and off we go tomorrow			0
but science fiction has a proven ability to inspire scientists and start technological innovation , " @entity184 explains			1
" it 's worth doing but one should bear in mind that , in the past , where there have been ideas that have worked there has also been a sea of ideas that did n't work			0
