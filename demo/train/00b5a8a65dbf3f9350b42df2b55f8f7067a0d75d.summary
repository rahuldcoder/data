-- it 's a beautiful spring morning in @entity2			1
i 'm standing next to my shiny new road bike on the side of a road , weeping			2
passers - by probably assume that i 've taken a tumble from said bicycle			2
so why the tears ? it 's simple : i feel completely out of control			1
when i was chosen as a member of the @entity14 i was thrilled			2
but almost immediately the fear , doubt and worry set in			1
in fact , my exact words to dr. @entity18 were , " i 'm so excited and a little bit terrified			2
" i soon settled into my new fitness routine			2
each workout was challenging and , for the most part , served to build my confidence			0
i was running longer without breaks , i was swimming faster and i stopped falling over on the bike			0
three months later i boarded a plane to @entity27 , @entity2 , to meet up with my teammates and coaches for a week of intense triathlon training			1
the schedule was ambitious , leaving me physically exhausted at the end of each day			0
but coach april knew we could rise to the occasion , and we did so repeatedly during the week			0
a few days into training , we tackled our first group bike ride			1
for me , this was the first time riding in traffic , and i was anxious			1
i was paired with @entity40 , a @entity41 alumnus , and we fell into place at the back of the pack			0
when we took a right and headed onto the main road , i freaked			0
there was no paved shoulder			0
we were riding on the white line , and i had to trust that drivers would n't plow into me			1
i was focusing on cycling , clipping in and out of my pedals and following @entity40 as close to that white line as possible			0
then she asked me to pass her so that she would bring up the rear			0
my brain just shut down			0
for the first time in my training , the voice telling me , " you ca n't do this " was simply too loud to ignore			1
i pulled over and wept			0
instead of my usual optimism and tenacity , i was consumed by fear and the foregone conclusion of failure			1
i was terrified of how close the passing cars felt and how fast they seemed to be zipping by me			0
i did n't trust the drivers to see me , and i did n't trust in my cycling ability to be able to stay out of harm 's way			1
i had pushed past the boundaries of my comfort zone , into a place where i lacked control			1
that is not a place i 'm used to visiting , let alone taking off my coat and staying awhile			0
there were other challenges for me during the week of training			1
do n't get me wrong ; i had some amazing successes and workouts that just clicked			1
but there were times that the sentiment , " what did i get myself into ? " reverberated in my mind			0
i quickly realized that my fear of losing control was jeopardizing my triathlon goal			1
worse , it was robbing me of the joy of my journey			0
nope , not going to happen on my watch			0
so here 's what i 've learned : 1			0
there is a ton of literature indicating that the fear of losing control is a prevalent issue			1
the toll that living in such a heightened state of fear , anxiety and stress can have on a person is also well - documented			1
a quick glance at a list of common phobias , such as fear of flying and enclosed spaces , reveals that a perceived loss of control is the root of most fear			1
knowing i 'm not alone prevents wasting energy wondering , " what is wrong with me ? " and instead focuses me on changing my perspective			0
desiring control is wanting certainty in an uncertain world			1
folks with this fear are usually perfectionists			1
i need to accept that no one is capable of controlling the future			0
to break out of the anxiety - filled cycle i have to give up the notion that i have some superhuman level of control			1
accepting that i ca n't completely control the future does not mean that i stop taking responsibility for my actions , decisions or thoughts			1
i can control my attitude			1
i can choose to rise to the challenge and genuinely try my best and be proud of that regardless of the outcome			0
i can make the best choices given the information i have at the time , understanding that nothing is certain			2
so how do i quit the control cycle ? i have to be brave			2
i have to have courage that i am doing my best with the tools i currently possess and that will be enough			0
at the beginning of this journey , my friend advised me to " lean into the fear " of triathlon training			1
that sentiment rang true during my time in @entity2			2
i 'm proud to say that these hard - won lessons have served to galvanize my resolve			2
i returned from @entity2 more determined , more committed , more courageous			0
my first week back , i squeezed in two extra swim workouts and a yoga class in addition to my regular training load			2
and i have enjoyed every minute of it ! the joy has returned to my journey , and i do n't plan to let it get away from me again			2
i know that when i cross that finish line in @entity167 , it wo n't be the capstone to a perfect race because there is no such thing			2
but it will be my race			0
and that will be more than enough			0
follow @entity174 on @entity175 @ @entity176			1

@entity178 was pushed out of her comfort zone on a training trip
letting go of control was hard , but @entity174 was n't going to let fear rule her life
@entity174 is n't alone -- many *people* have a hard time giving up control
