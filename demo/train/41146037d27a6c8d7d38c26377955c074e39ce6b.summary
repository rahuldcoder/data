-- this year in tv was all about having what you wanted when you wanted it			1
some tv viewers binged on hours upon hours of shows , while others were simply more selective with what they viewed			2
whether it was content saved on a dvr or streaming services like @entity13 and @entity14 , viewers spent plenty of time growing fat on the lamb that was this year in tv			1
with so much technology , viewers almost did n't need to actually sit in front of a tv in order to enjoy tv in 2013			2
" television is becoming ever less about the box in the corner of the room , and ever more about the content it gives you access to , " according to 33 @entity30 & @entity32 's @entity31 2013			2
such indulgence meant 2013 was also the year that @entity13 became a source for major networks to contend with			1
do n't believe that ? check the awards shows			0
@entity13 has garnered six @entity39 nominations , placing them ahead of broadcast television networks @entity41 , @entity42 ( which each had five nominations ) and @entity44 ( which had four )			1
@entity13 's " @entity46 " starring @entity47 and @entity48 snagged the most with four nominations , while their other hit series " @entity49 is the @entity50 " and the revived " @entity51 " each received one nomination			1
@entity13 also made history in september by winning three emmys			1
not bad for a company that only a few years ago was competing with the now defunct @entity58 in getting dvds into the hands of customers			0
while streaming and @entity62 shows is not new , the take off of the original content really came into its own in 2013			2
@entity66 , head of content development for @entity68 , said she sees it as a natural progression as consumers become more comfortable " living online			0
" " what 's been great for all the online , on - demand distributors of content is that people really start to think about a place where we have first - window content that has n't been anywhere else , " @entity72 said			1
" i think it 's a great virtuous circle that makes people more curious about ' hey , i can discover things that i like here in this world that is n't necessarily available for me through traditional networks			0
' " @entity68 's most successful first - run series , " misfits , " returned this fall for its fifth and final season , and the company announced its first co-production with @entity93 , " @entity104 , " a supernatural comedy starring @entity95 and @entity96 , as well as second seasons of the animated series " @entity99 " from " @entity103 " star @entity100 and the western procedural comedy " @entity102			2
" @entity72 , whose company partners with network tv to stream their series , said on - demand companies like hers help " raise consumer awareness about shows that may need a little more time to gain a big audience			1
" " then that audience goes and finds that show on the network because they want to watch it live when an episode comes on , " she said			0
" or they use us occasionally when they want to play catch up			0
" @entity14 is also throwing its hat into the original content ring			2
in may the company announced that it would be creating five shows based on response from 14 pilots it posted online			0
" @entity132 , " " @entity133 , " " betas , " " @entity135 " and " @entity136 " have all gotten the green light			0
with so much available content , viewers now no longer have to patiently wait for a new tv series to gain traction			2
they can instead catch up on a show that is already popular or indulge in original programming from aggregators			1
@entity144 recently reported that the concept of " binge watching " may be changing			0
a @entity148 survey commissioned by @entity13 found that those responding considered binge watching to be " watching a handful of episodes ( between 2 - 6 episodes ) of the same tv show in one sitting			1
" respondents also said they found binge watching an enjoyable activity			0
that is not at all to suggest that broadcast and cable are dead			0
to the contrary , 2013 found fans losing it over the series finale of @entity165 's " @entity164 , " enraptured by " @entity166 ' " " @entity172 " episode and fully embracing new shows like @entity42 's " @entity169 " and @entity171 's " @entity170			0
" staff writers at the @entity174 recently selected their favorite episodes of 2013 and they were as varied as episode seven of " @entity51 " on @entity13 to the " @entity179 " episode of @entity171 's " the @entity178			1
" on the cable side , original programming including @entity182 's reality show " @entity185 " and the @entity184 's miniseries " @entity186 " scored big ratings			1
in october , the @entity189 released its first ever " @entity191 ratings , " which measures the amount of tweets about a show and the size of the audience that views them			1
for the week of september 23 , " @entity164 " ranked no. 1 with 9.3 million unique users seeing tweets specific to that show			0
the increased focus on social and tv also grew in 2013 , with @entity191 announcing in november that it had updated its apps to allow for better organization of trending tv shows			1
that means it 's now easier for " scandal " fans to find each other and for viewers to " hate tweet " the live production of @entity42 's " @entity216 , " which they did in droves			0
audiences definitely know what they want and @entity68 's @entity72 said she see the challenge in both attracting and keeping viewers who are now completely used to having the power of on - demand			1
" one of the things we work very hard at is being the perfect matchmaker between audience and show , " she said			0
" we work on what 's the right strategy to reach those in the market place and break through all of the noise			0
