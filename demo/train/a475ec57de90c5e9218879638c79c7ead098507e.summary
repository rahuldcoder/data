@entity0 , @entity1 -- if you 've ever been on the subway during rush hour in one of the world 's major cities you will understand how crammed the @entity9 was taking off from the flood ravaged town of @entity0 in the @entity13 district of @entity1			1
normally the @entity14 can carry up to 100 people , but according to a @entity18 officer charged with counting the passengers there were more than 120 on board when lieutenant colonel @entity22 's chopper lifted off			2
it was another show of how the @entity25 military is pushing the boundaries trying to help those who have lost everything in the floods that hit @entity1 more than six weeks ago			1
" we 're averaging about 200,000 pounds ( 91,000 kilograms ) of aid every day , " @entity22 said in an interview with @entity2			0
" we are also helping displaced people , ferrying about 200 per day , if not more			0
" the @entity25 military has 18 helicopters from the 16th @entity35 out of @entity36 , @entity37 , flying aid missions to the @entity13 district of @entity1			1
the crews will be on missions for about eight hours every day usually flying aid into ravaged towns like @entity0 and evacuating residents from the area			1
the @entity13 district is considered one of the most beautiful areas in all of @entity1 with mountains almost 20,000 feet high			1
but the mountainous terrain also makes flying challenging for the crews			0
" some of the areas we fly into are kind of small , because we are landing into villages that do n't normally have aircraft traffic			0
they 're not set up to handle aircraft as big as this			0
so some of the landing sites are kind of small and it is a bit tricky to get several aircraft into there , but you just have to be careful and watch what 's around you , " said warrant officer @entity56 , who flies a @entity57			0
the town of @entity0 , one of the main destinations for the aid - carrying @entity25 helicopters , was considered one of the prime tourist destinations in @entity1 before the @entity13 river , which flows through the town , burst its banks on july 29			1
the rising waters literally tore large chunks out of the city destroying many of the town 's prime hotels			0
" seeing the people that we are moving around , seeing the damage that has been done to their villages , they have been cut off from their road network , their access to food and basic supplies , that we tend to take for granted , " said @entity80			2
" so helping them is certainly a rewarding experience for us			0
" the @entity25 crews even fly produce for farmers in areas cut off from road access so they can get their goods to local markets			1
@entity13 also has political significance for the @entity25 and @entity1			1
until last year , the district was ruled by militants like the @entity103 before the @entity18 military cleared the area , and the population is very distrustful of the @entity25			1
so far , however , the troops say they have not seen any hostility from the local people			0
" we 've had no problems , " said @entity22			0
" we 've had no security issues , it has been safe			0
they are in need and from what i can see they are extremely happy to see us			0
" most of the helicopters flying into the devastated areas are packed with aid as the military is trying to stockpile goods in @entity0 and other places that are still cut off			1
they know once the winter arrives it will often be impossible to fly into @entity13 , even though , being a unit out of @entity37 , the pilots are used to flying in extreme snow conditions			2
" in terms of the mountains and the snow this will feel a lot like flying back home , " said @entity80 as he was steering his chinook toward a resupply point called @entity134 , where the helicopters are refueled and loaded with aid			2
the @entity25 says the aid flights will continue until the job is done and that could take several months			2
@entity18 military officials say the chopper crews have been vital to their flood response efforts and have done a lot to improve @entity25 's standing in this part of the world .			1
