@entity0 , @entity1 -- a car bomb detonated in the eastern @entity1 city of @entity6 on saturday , causing material damage but no casualties , local officials said			1
the @entity9 said in a statement that the rigged car detonated in @entity13 district outside a school used as a training center for local municipal elections			1
the blast damaged vehicles and nearby buildings , according to the council			2
the @entity9 said it holds the government and the @entity22 responsible for what it described as the " dire situation " that has " plagued " the city for a while with the lack of security highlighted by killings and bombings			1
in recent weeks there has been an uptick in violence in the city , most notably in an assassination campaign that has primarily targeted members of the security forces , most of whom held positions under the former regime over the past week at least four senior members of the security forces , including the head of the country 's military police , have been assassinated in @entity6			1
in a report released by @entity49 in august , the watchdog reported the death of more than 50 people in what it said was a " broadening wave of political assassinations " focused mostly in the eastern cities of @entity56 and @entity6			2
but in its report , @entity49 said the number of those killed " is probably higher			0
" no group has claimed responsibility for these attacks , and there has been public outrage in the city over what activists and residents say is a lack of accountability			2
so far no one has been brought to justice in the escalating violence in @entity6			1
this week @entity1 marked the second anniversary of the fall of the @entity77 regime , but many @entity1 are concerned about the deteriorating security and the increasing power of the hundreds of militias with different regional and political loyalties that continue to operate freely in the country			0
following last year 's attack on the @entity86 consulate in @entity6 that left four @entity86 dead , including ambassador @entity87 , and a series of attacks targeting foreign diplomatic missions , there has been concern about the growing presence and activity of @entity95 militant groups , some with ties to @entity98 , mostly in the eastern part of the country			1
the weakness of @entity1 's central government and its inability to build an army and police force was underscored this month with the kidnapping of the country 's prime minister by a militia force that seized him for a few hours before releasing him			0
amid the growing concerns about the situation in the north @entity114 nation , @entity115 on monday said it had agreed to @entity1 's request for the alliance to provide advice on defense institution building			0
@entity115 said it will create a " a small advisory team to conduct this effort			0
" many @entity1 welcomed the move , but said this was something @entity126 powers should have done two years ago following their military campaign that led to the overthrow of the regime .			0
