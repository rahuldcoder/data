-- they just do n't get it			1
two months after playing partisan chicken with the debt - ceiling limit and leading directly to a @entity8 downgrade , our dysfunctional divided @entity3 was at it again -- carelessly bringing the country to the brink of a government shutdown			1
this time the debate was over disaster - relief spending			1
republicans wanted to ensure that any extra money needed for @entity17 in the wake of @entity19 would be matched by cuts in spending elsewhere			2
the @entity22 - controlled @entity21 rejected the @entity24 bill as a form of extortion and so the stalemate continued through the weekend , bringing @entity17 within days of being insolvent			2
ultimately , the two parties came to an agreement that funded @entity17 but simply kicked the prospect of a government shutdown to right before @entity32			1
it used to be that at least a disaster could unite @entity3 to think beyond party politics			1
but we are living in a time where extreme measures are used every day			2
the threat of a government shutdown is seen as negotiating leverage			1
threat of filibuster has gone from a rare event to a routine parliamentary procedure			1
there is no question why @entity48 is broken			2
the two parties have become so polarized they seem unable to reason together			1
special interests threaten to eclipse the national interest			2
hyper - partisanship is hurting our country because it is stopping us from being able to solve the serious problems we face			2
that was the unambiguous message @entity56 's sent the @entity8 with its downgrade in august that specifically cited an atmosphere of partisan gamesmanship			2
it was echoed by @entity62 chairman @entity61 -- a @entity63 and @entity64 appointee -- in remarks at the @entity67 conference in @entity68			2
we have a political crisis , which is compounding the fiscal crisis			2
this is not an elite concern , but a problem increasingly recognized by everyday americans far away from the @entity74			2
" @entity78 are intelligent but they have no common sense , " @entity75 of @entity76 recently told @entity77			2
" they fight too much			2
they should be put in a corner and take a time out and start working together as a team			0
i 'm so sick of hearing republicans this and @entity86 that			0
" this is the articulation of the impulse that led 77 % of @entity8 to tell @entity0 that @entity3 acts like " spoiled children " rather than responsible adults			1
this latest flirtation with a government shutdown just shows how tone - deaf @entity3 has become			1
@entity24 @entity93 played politics with disaster relief and felt that they would be rewarded by their base if they do so			1
their all - or - nothing mindset leads them to the logic that @entity86 will be to blame for a shutdown if they simply refuse to do what @entity93 demand			1
what 's doubly dumb about this particular battle is that it is over relatively small change -- some $ 2.5 billion in disaster relief at a time when a bipartisan joint super committee is struggling to find a minimum of $ 1.2 trillion in deficit reduction			1
president @entity64 and speaker @entity110 and 35 senators have encouraged the super-committee to go bigger -- to $ 4 trillion in deficit and debt reduction -- the amount almost achieved by so - called grand bargain that failed to materialize in august			0
bipartisan committees like @entity118 and the @entity119 -- as well as a plan proposed by @entity122 chairman @entity121 -- also set out different paths to a $ 4 trillion savings , bringing us to a more sound fiscal footing			0
we know what such a step will require : spending cuts and some revenue increases , best achieved with tax reform and entitlement reform			0
the far right opposes any tax increases while the far - left opposes any entitlement reform			0
but there should still be room to reason together			0
for example , one solution would be to cut tax rates but close select loopholes , allowing higher revenue to be raised from lower rates			0
unfortunately , some folks on the far - right have decided that raising revenue at all will be considered a tax - hike and a violation of the anti-tax pledge			0
that all - or - nothing logic threatens to doom the deliberations that democratic republics depend on			0
it does n't have to be this way			0
for most of the 20th century , congressional voting patterns were clustered toward the center -- the presence of conservative @entity86 and liberal @entity93 allowed for creative across - the - aisle coalitions			0
but in the past two decades , as the parties have become more ideologically and geographically stratified , the capacity for coalition building has decreased			1
the rigged system of redistricting and closed partisan primaries have helped further polarize the process as centrists are pushed out of both parties			1
likewise , in the past divided government has not meant dysfunction			0
@entity8 accomplished the @entity168 and the @entity169 under divided government during the @entity172 and @entity173 administrations			0
the achievements of the @entity176 era came with liberal democrat @entity177 at the helm of the @entity24			0
the two men disagreed deeply on political philosophy , but they had the capacity to disagree agreeably , sit together and tell stories at the end of the day			0
( and not incidentally , @entity176 and @entity177 were able to form a bipartisan commission to help fix social security in the 1980s by requiring both parties to jump in together )			1
even @entity187 and house speaker @entity188 found ways to work together despite intense personal dislike , achieving welfare reform and turning deficits into a surplus			0
but now , politics is increasingly seen as ideological blood sport and a zero - sum game			1
the parties are willing to politicize disaster relief and bring our nation to the brink of default			1
they oppose even bipartisan plans for fear that the other side might gain politically			0
trust is eroded and replaced with the demonization of disagreement			0
this approach is fundamentally incompatible with the facts of divided government , which requires some degree of compromise based on defining common ground and then building on it			1
some hyper - partisans in @entity48 are simply looking to the next election to solve these problems			0
but the problem of extreme partisanship is bigger than one election			0
during this cancer in our body politic will require a cultural change			0
it will require actively supporting responsible voices in both parties			1
it will require pushing for policies like redistricting reform and open primaries			0
there need to be procedural reforms in congress as well -- for example , ending the special interest weapon of " secret holds " and requiring that filibusters be conducted in person			1
in a larger sense , we need to rediscover some forgotten wisdom from the founding fathers			0
as @entity246 said in his first inaugural address , after a bitterly hard - fought campaign , " every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle			0
" we need to remember what president @entity253 used to say : " i am an @entity8 , a @entity255 , and a @entity22 -- in that order			1
" we have been through much tougher times as a nation before and emerged stronger			1
the danger today is that this crisis is self - inflicted and self - indulgent			0
the parties need to remember that they are not the purpose of our politics -- and even though they might be polarized , the vast majority of the @entity8 people are not			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity268 .			1

@entity268 : once rare , *tthreats* of shutdown , filibusters are now routine
@entity268 : parties are willing to politicize disaster relief , bring nation to the brink of default
@entity282 mindset of @entity3 defeats coalition building , he says
parties need to remember that they are not the purpose of our politics
