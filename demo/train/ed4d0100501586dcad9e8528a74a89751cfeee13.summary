@entity0 , @entity1 -- the woman who stabbed pregnant actress @entity4 to death will be considered for parole from prison a month after the 40th anniversary of the killings that cast a shadow of fear over southern @entity1			1
@entity12 , shown here after her indictment in the @entity15 murders , has been denied parole 17 times			1
@entity12 , 61 , has been denied parole in 12 previous hearings , but the former " @entity15 " member now is terminally ill with brain cancer and is paralyzed			1
@entity15 used his hypnotic powers to direct @entity12 and other " family " members to kill seven people , including the pregnant @entity24 , in a two - night rampage that terrorized the city of @entity0 , @entity1 , in august 1969			1
atkins -- who was initially sentenced to death along with @entity15 and three others -- will have her 13th parole hearing on september 2 , according to a spokesman with the @entity32			1
in july of last year , @entity12 -- @entity1 's longest - serving female inmate -- was denied a compassionate release in a unanimous decision by the @entity36			1
she has repeatedly been described as a model prisoner who has accepted responsibility for her role in the slayings , and she now shuns @entity15			0
by her own admission , @entity12 held @entity24 down as she pleaded for mercy and stabbed the pregnant woman 16 times			1
in a 1993 parole board hearing , @entity12 said @entity24 " asked me to let her baby live			1
... i told her i did n't have any mercy on her			0
" after stabbing @entity24 to death , according to historical accounts of the murders , @entity12 scrawled the word " pig " in blood on the door of the home @entity24 shared with her husband , director @entity58			1
@entity58 was not home at the time , but three of @entity24 's house guests were also slain by the killers , as was a teenager who was visiting the home 's caretaker in his nearby cottage			0
a web site maintained by her husband and attorney , @entity70 , says @entity12 is now paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and can not sit up in bed or even be moved into a wheelchair			1
however , despite her declining condition and her impressive prison record , the site says , " there is still a very real chance the @entity76 will nonetheless insist her release would be a danger to society			2
" @entity12 ' compassionate release was opposed by @entity24 's sister , @entity86 , @entity88 prosecutors and @entity1 gov. @entity89 , among others			1
however , the former prosecutor who won her conviction , @entity93 , said he supports @entity12 ' request for release			1
" she has paid substantially , though not completely , for her horrendous crimes , " @entity93 told the @entity96 last year			2
" paying completely would mean imposing the death penalty			2
" @entity93 is the author of several books on the @entity15 case , including " @entity101			0
" @entity102 told @entity2 in an e-mail in march that she does not believe any @entity15 family member convicted of murder should ever be set free , saying the slayings were " so vicious , so inhumane , so depraved , that there is no turning back			0
" " the ' @entity15 ' murderers are sociopaths , and from that , they can never be rehabilitated , " @entity102 said			0
" they should all stay right where they are -- in prison -- until they die			0
there will never be true justice for my sister @entity4 and the other victims of the ' @entity15			0
' keeping the murderers in prison is the least we , as a society who values justice , can do			0
" in a manuscript posted on her web site , @entity12 , who was known within the @entity15 as @entity12 , wrote that " this is the past i have to live with , and i have to live with it every day			1
" " unlike the reader , or the people who seem to think @entity15 was cool , i ca n't think about it for an hour or so and then go on with my life			0
just like the families and friends of the victims , this is with me every day			0
i have to wake up every day with this and no matter what i do for the rest of my life and no matter how much i give back to the community i will never be able to replace what my crime took away			0
and that 's not ' neat , ' and that 's not ' cool			0
' " @entity12 was housed in the @entity145 until may 2008 , when her declining health caused her to be moved to @entity147 at @entity148			2
@entity15 and those convicted along with him in the murders -- @entity12 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity151 -- have been in @entity1 prisons for more than three decades			2
all were initially sentenced to death , only to have their sentences commuted to life in prison when the @entity160 struck down death penalty laws in 1972 , establishing a four - year moratorium on executions			2
@entity153 was released for six months after her conviction was overturned , but was reconvicted			2
