" move on , @entity0 ! your home is at @entity3 ! send you to the gas ! " these are comments that you might expect to hear in 1940s @entity8 , but in 2014 ? apparently yes , according to a @entity10 municipal prosecutor in @entity11 , who decided this week that chants by football fans are not criminal offenses			1
the incident , which happened during a @entity10 league game between @entity18 and @entity19 on september 29 , 2013 , has sparked debate over the country 's attitude towards @entity23			1
" this case is being discussed a lot in @entity10 and rightly causing critique of the system and its decision , " @entity10 football writer @entity24 told @entity25			1
" although the @entity32 , the @entity32 , has introduced stricter laws and are more proactive in dealing with such problems than they were , there is no plan , no willingness to do anything with the problem			2
" there is no special police line to report abuse anonymously			0
" @entity32 did not respond to @entity25 's request for comment			0
prosecutor @entity44 decided not to take any action against the @entity18 fans on the grounds that their chants were directed at the opposing team and not specifically at @entity0			1
the team , @entity18 , said in a statement to @entity25 , " the club has already expressed its condemnation of this type of behavior and has fulfilled its obligations to the police and prosecutors			1
" " the club does not deal in the prosecution of groups of fans , because this is the task of the aforementioned police and prosecutors			1
" one of the aims of the club is to educate its fans , to talk with them and eradicate certain issues			1
this approach has been in place at the club for many years			2
" anti-semitism within @entity10 football is not a new phenomenon			1
in a country where some of the worst atrocities of the @entity82 were committed , the home of @entity3 , this latest episode will be difficult for many outside of @entity10 to comprehend			1
@entity84 has often been often targeted because of its links to the @entity0 community which was exterminated by the @entity88 during the @entity82			0
known as a " @entity0 club " in the same way as @entity92 team @entity91 and @entity94 side @entity93 are , @entity84 and the city 's smaller club , @entity95 , are often taunted by rival team 's fans			1
@entity10 was home to the largest jewish community in @entity8 before the @entity82 , when 90 % of the country 's 3.3 million @entity0 were killed by the @entity88			2
today there are an estimated 25,000			0
@entity103 , the president of the @entity104 , says the decision has consolidated a view that @entity23 is the " last acceptable prejudice in football			1
" " unfortunately , extreme anti-semitic chants like those in @entity11 are regularly heard in many @entity114 stadiums , including in @entity92 and @entity115 , and the reaction of the authorities is minimal , " @entity103 said in a statement on the organization 's website			2
the problems within @entity10 football are not confined to @entity11 and @entity120 -- @entity121 and @entity122 witness similar incidents whenever those cities ' clubs play each other			1
@entity127 , a club founded by @entity0 in 1906 , endures a hateful relationship with its @entity129 rival @entity130 , which is driven by @entity23			2
@entity130 's hardcore supporters , known as the " @entity133 , " are infamous for their chanting and banners , even though the club has signed @entity0 players in the past			1
" it is naive to think that there is n't still an @entity23 problem in @entity10 , however the most worrying thing is that in some cases it clearly is n't seen as a problem at all , " @entity139 of @entity140 told @entity25			1
" the irony in some of these chants is that the perpetrators sometimes have @entity0 players within their teams			2
" @entity154 , an @entity156 international , and his fellow countryman @entity157 " @entity157 , played a massive part in @entity153 's title success in 2010 - 11 -- @entity154 even scoring the winner against rivals @entity127 , which won the title			0
" but even since then , it is n't uncommon to hear these chants used in a derogatory way			2
" the frustration for many is that the authorities , including the @entity32 , do not seem to be tackling the problem head on			0
there are a number of stories of anti-semitic banners being paraded in stadiums and similarly offensive t - shirts being sold outside venues			0
the tale of how @entity175 fans displayed a banner at the home game against local rival @entity178 depicting a @entity0 man in an @entity3 uniform with a " no entry " sign across his face and the slogan , " death to those with curved noses , " is just one that has come to prominence			0
in september 2011 , when @entity156 side @entity189 played at @entity190 , its players and fans were abused throughout the contest			0
@entity190 's supporters , who are renowned for being racist , unveiled a large " @entity198 " banner behind the goal while holding up placards			0
two weeks later , the same fans chanted " @entity202 , @entity202 , @entity0 off to the gas , " at @entity19 fans instead of the traditional chant of , " your home is @entity3 , all @entity10 knows that the entire @entity0 army is going to the gas chamber			1
" " i would n't say that all @entity10 fans are anti-semitic or that this is a common situation because it 's not , " added @entity24			1
" the problem is real , though , and comes from the fact that most of the ultras groups and hooligans are connecting themselves to far - right movements which they take and explain as patriotic			0
" unfortunately , many of them despite not being anti-semitic , use the chants often , also claiming it is because it was always like that , it should not be understood as racism or anti-semitism or anything like that			1
" that is dangerous as well , obviously , while @entity32 is not doing anything about it -- rarely even commenting it			0
" the incident in @entity10 came just weeks after @entity231 footballer @entity230 courted controversy by making the " quenelle " gesture after scoring for @entity235 in the @entity236			2
the " quenelle " involves pointing the right arm down at an angle and touching that arm with the left hand			0
@entity230 has said that the celebration was nothing more than a nod to his friend , controversial @entity231 comedian @entity246 , who has popularized the gesture in @entity231			0
but others believe the gesture is a @entity251 salute in reverse , and it has been linked to rising anti-semitism in @entity231 -- a charge over which @entity246 , a holocaust denier , faces an investigation by the @entity258 prosecutor 's office			0
the @entity259 has yet to make a decision on whether the player will face sanctions			0
but @entity103 believes that the incident in @entity10 , coupled with @entity230 's gesture , has brought about a new wave of @entity23 within football			1
" we have seen quick condemnation , bans and major fines when other minorities are attacked by players and fans in @entity8 , but barely a whimper is heard when @entity0 are subject to attack , " he said in the statement			0
" it has been over two weeks since @entity230 's offensive salute and it is completely clear to all that the gesture was designed to offend @entity0 by an unrepentant anti-semite and holocaust - denier			0
" the silence on behalf of the football authorities compounds the original offense by @entity230 , and if it is not harshly dealt with it will be seen as implicit acceptance of this anti-semitic affront			2

@entity10 municipal officer rules that chants by @entity18 supporters not anti-semitic
