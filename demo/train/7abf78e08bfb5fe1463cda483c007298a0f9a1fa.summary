@entity0 will unveil the latest version of its @entity2 on september 10 , according to a new report			1
the news comes from @entity5 , the @entity6 - affiliated tech blog that has a solid track record for reporting inside @entity0 information			1
@entity0 is believed to be working on a smartwatch and a tv , but neither of those products are expected to be ready for rollout at next month 's event			2
@entity0 did not immediately respond to a request for comment			1
likely to be called either the @entity2 6 or @entity19 , the phone 's release date would fit the schedule @entity0 has established since the first @entity2 was released in 2007			1
the company has released a new @entity2 model every year , and the release dates have all been in the summer or fall			2
the @entity2 came out in september 2012 , the @entity24 in october 2011 , and the three versions before that in the summer months			1
the release date is the most recent , and probably one of the most accurate , rumors that precede this @entity0 release			2
the upcoming @entity0 event will come at a unique time for the tech giant , which has dominated the smartphone and tablet markets for almost as long as they have existed			2
@entity38 - based phones like @entity40 's @entity39 have put a dent in @entity2 sales , while some critics have said the latest updates to the @entity2 and @entity45 lack significant innovation			2
read : how @entity40 is out - innovating @entity0 the new @entity2 will run @entity47 7 , the latest version of @entity0 's mobile operating system , which includes new typography , redesigned icons and a new color palette			1
here 's a roundup of some of the speculation swirling around the next @entity2			2
as always with such things , take it all with a grain of salt			0
leaks along @entity0 's supply line have become more frequent , but that does n't mean all of them turn out to be accurate			1
-- the new phone will likely be the @entity19 and keep the same design as the current @entity2			1
the @entity64 was followed by the @entity24 , which maintained the same form			0
-- the company will also roll out a cheaper version of the @entity2 , largely for sale in emerging markets			1
@entity70 reported that it will cost $ 99 and come in five or six different colors			0
it may or may not be called the @entity72			0
@entity0 senior vice president @entity73 has tossed cold water on this idea , though @entity0 is known for misdirection in advance of new product releases			0
-- since there will be a cheaper @entity2 , @entity0 will discontinue production of older models			1
-- there will be at least one larger @entity2 model , with a 4.7 - inch screen , a 5.7 - inch screen , or both to compete with big - screen rivals from @entity40 , @entity87 and other makers			0
-- the new phone will have a fingerprint scanner for added security and other uses			0
-- as usual , it will have a faster processor , longer battery life , and an improved camera			0
not much of a stretch there -- all of these upgrades are typical of any gadget update			0
again , it remains to be seen which of these rumors and reports pan out			0
and @entity0 can be counted on for at least a few surprises .			0
