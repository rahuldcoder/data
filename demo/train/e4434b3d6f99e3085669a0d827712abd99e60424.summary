@entity0 -- a compromise proposal to expand background checks on gun sales lacks enough support to win @entity7 approval now , which will likely delay a vote on the measure that has strong public support , one of the sponsors told @entity1 on monday			1
sen. @entity13 , @entity14 , acknowledged the vote on the amendment he worked out with @entity18 sen. @entity17 of @entity19 was being pushed back to try to build more support			1
asked if the vote would take place tuesday or wednesday , as supporters had hoped , @entity13 said he did n't think so			1
" i would say by the end of the week , probably , " he added			2
the @entity13 - @entity17 compromise had been scheduled as the first amendment to be considered as part of gun legislation pushed by president @entity29 and @entity30 in the aftermath of the @entity33 school massacre in december			1
last week , the broader gun package received 68 votes , including 16 from @entity18 , to bring it to the @entity7 floor			1
before discussion on the legislation began monday , @entity13 told @entity1 there was more work to do			2
" we 've got to work hard and the more people know about the bill , the more people read the bill , the more people see the facts of the bill , it breaks down all the misnomers , " he said of what he called misinformation about the background check proposal being spread by opponents			2
both @entity13 and @entity17 are self - professed gun lovers who have gotten high marks from the powerful @entity59 for their voting records on firearms issues			2
however , the @entity59 opposes their compromise , casting doubt on whether it can get the 60 @entity7 votes necessary to pass under the filibuster threshold imposed by @entity18			0
far fewer republicans than the 16 who voted last week to open debate are committed to backing the @entity13 - @entity17 amendment or supporting the final gun package			1
so far , four @entity18 senators have declared they will support the @entity13 - @entity17 compromise or were leaning toward backing it			1
with at least two moderate @entity30 from pro-gun states known to oppose the measure , it needs at least seven @entity18 votes to have any chance of passing			0
gun rights group endorses background check deal the amendment will be one of perhaps dozens to be debated on the broader package of gun laws drafted in response to the killing of 20 first - graders and six educators at the @entity91 in @entity33 , @entity92			1
the package also contains measures to crack down on gun trafficking and straw purchases , and to find ways to improve school safety			2
on monday , @entity100 spokesman @entity99 sought to keep up the pressure on senators to approve the expanded background checks , noting polls show about 90 % of @entity105 support such a move			1
" if they vote no , they will be siding with the 10 % and not the 90 % in the @entity105 that support background check legislation , " @entity99 told reporters			2
in debate expected to last two weeks , senators will consider efforts by both sides to either expand or weaken the gun package			1
@entity18 sen. @entity116 will support @entity13 - @entity17 gun compromise a push by @entity30 for an updated ban on semiautomatic firearms modeled after military assault weapons , as well as limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds , is expected to fail			1
republicans will push an @entity59 proposal to make state concealed weapons permits acceptable nationwide , a concept opposed by many @entity30			0
since the @entity33 attack by a lone gunman , @entity92 and a few other states have passed tougher gun laws			0
while polls show @entity105 favoring expanded background checks and other proposals intended to crack down on gun trafficking , more pro-gun states have passed laws easing firearms restrictions			1
in addition , the @entity59 has promised political retribution for legislators who back measures it opposes			0
" this debate in some ways is underscoring just the extent to which there is a polarization in our society , " @entity17 told @entity1 on sunday , lamenting " the acrimony that has gotten into politics			0
" asked if he was concerned about political repercussions , the conservative @entity18 said : " i 'll just let the political chips fall the way they fall			0
" in a separate interview on @entity158 , @entity13 acknowledged the power of the @entity59 , saying : " they wo n't be with us on this and i just would hope that they would allow their members to see the facts and let them vote their conscience			2
" both senators said monday that part of the problem involves misconceptions about their compromise , and they urged colleagues to read the 49 - page measure instead of relying on what they called erroneous political rhetoric by opponents			0
their amendment expands background checks to gun shows and all internet sales , but exempts private transactions such as hunting rifles traded among family and friends			1
co-author of gun compromise says @entity7 support an ' open question ' it also makes it easier for hunters and sport shooters to transport their firearms across state lines			1
it would also require states and the federal government to provide records on criminals and the " violently mentally ill " to the national background check system , addressing a criticism by the @entity59 and other opponents of gun laws that the existing system lacks substantive information			2
in addition , the plan calls for a new @entity209 on @entity210 to report in six months on " all aspects of the problem , including guns , school safety , mental health , and violent media or video games			0
" the @entity59 opposes the compromise as a possible first step toward a national gun registry and therefore a violation of the constitutional right to bear arms			2
however , smaller pro-gun groups have come out in favor of the @entity13 - @entity17 amendment , indicating a rift in the gun lobby over the emotional issue of taking legislative action in response to the @entity33 killings			1
@entity13 said monday he was reaching out to senators who voted last week against beginning debate on guns			1
" we 're working on all of them			0
some of them who might not have voted for cloture might be more receptive once they see the facts , " he said			0
" now that we have gun groups coming out in support , it really helps us			2
" @entity13 and @entity17 noted monday that their proposal includes a specific prohibition against a national gun registry as well as criminal penalties for misusing background check information for that purpose			1
in a statement on sunday , moderate @entity253 sen. @entity253 of @entity254 said she would support the compromise because it exempted private family gun transactions from needing a background check , calling it a " commonsense approach " that required the screening only for commercial transactions			1
no sense of urgency : rocky road ahead for gun legislation in the @entity100 even if the compromise passes and the @entity7 proceeds to approve a broader gun package , it was unclear if the @entity18 - led @entity100 would go along			1
house speaker @entity271 , @entity272 , has stopped short of promising a vote , saying only that the chamber would look at whatever the @entity7 sends over			0
@entity29 has made the gun legislation a major focus of his second term , holding events across the country to push for congressional action and public pressure			0
last weekend , the mother of one of the @entity33 schoolchildren killed in december delivered the weekly presidential address instead of @entity29			0
@entity286 , whose 6 - year - old son @entity287 died in the attack by a lone gunman , noted that since the december 14 killings , " thousands of other @entity105 have died at the end of a gun			0
" " thousands of other families across the @entity105 are also drowning in our grief , " @entity286 said			0
" please help us do something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy			0
" the issue has raised attention on overall gun deaths in the country , with supporters of tougher gun laws noting that more than half all homicides involve firearms and @entity105 levels are higher than other countries			0
on saturday night , a man shot himself to death during a @entity313 event sponsored by the @entity59 in @entity314			0
@entity1 's @entity315 , @entity316 and @entity317 contributed to this report .			0

new : sen. @entity13 says a vote on background checks unlikely until later in the week
a compromise amendment on background checks comes up this week

debate on the overall gun package is expected to last two weeks
