-- look at the goals @entity2 has set for himself and you 'll see an example of the @entity6 ambition that makes our nation great			1
@entity2 is a recent graduate of @entity9 in @entity10 , and is about to start a master 's program in bioethics at @entity14			1
but that 's just a steppingstone on his path , he hopes , to medical school , where he wants to study oncology			0
along the way , he 'd also like to join the military and serve our country as an @entity25 medic			0
sounds like a guy you 'd want as your neighbor ( or your doctor ) , right ? in @entity6 : program granting work rights for childhood immigrants begins well , there 's a catch : @entity2 was born in @entity36 and came to the @entity6 when he was 8 months old			1
although two older siblings were born here and are citizens , @entity2 is an undocumented immigrant			1
but the @entity41 administration saw that @entity6 was losing out when people like @entity2 could not reach their full potential because of their immigration status			1
the administration announced june 15 that it would consider requests for " deferred action " -- that is , a stay of deportation proceedings -- for young people who came to the @entity6 before age 16 , were 30 or younger as of june 15 , have lived in the @entity6 for at least five years , have graduated or are enrolled in school or were honorably discharged from the military , have stayed out of trouble and pass a background check			1
excitement has been building among eligible young people during the 60 days @entity56 had to work out the details			0
the agency published the request forms tuesday and is accepting requests starting wednesday			2
" deferred action for childhood arrivals , " as it is officially called , lifts the immediate threat of deportation proceedings from about 1 million aspiring citizens who see @entity6 as their only home			1
it does so at no cost to taxpayers ; applicants must pay a $ 465 fee , which will cover the program 's cost			0
but it does more than that			0
it is the first step toward the creation of a new immigration process that recognizes the contributions of new @entity6 â € ” whatever their provenance â € ” to our country and our culture			1
in @entity2 's case , that means getting an education that allows him to treat people who are fighting @entity6 's no. 2 killer			1
he knows a few cancer survivors ; he tells me he has known too many others who have died			0
already as an undergraduate , @entity2 did stem - cell research that could lead to new cancer treatments			2
for the next two years , at least , @entity2 will be able to work legally to help pay for graduate school			2
he can apply for internships and volunteer without worry			0
what is most meaningful to @entity2 ? " i 'll be able to have a valid @entity99 , " he tells me			2
" that 's the most overwhelming thing			0
even something that simple will give me a sense of actually belonging			0
" @entity2 and his peers will be @entity6 's next generation of entrepreneurs and farm workers , engineers and assembly - line employees , inventors , nurses , teachers -- and doctors			1
if they are n't curing you , they might be hiring you , teaching your children or keeping food on your table			0
they are good for @entity6			2
we are at our best when we encourage and reward hard work , not question it			0
we are at our strongest when we lift aspirations , not when we stifle them			0
we also must treat this positive step as an initial accomplishment , not a final one			0
as @entity2 and other aspiring citizens move closer to achieving their dreams , all of us must come together and move @entity129 to pass a permanent road map to citizenship for all who pledge allegiance to our country			1
wednesday is a day of new promise , new confidence and new opportunity to preserve and strengthen the @entity6 dream â € ” not just for @entity2 but for all of us			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity142 .			2

@entity142 : to see the promise of immigrant ambition , look to the goals of @entity2
he says @entity2 came *illegally* as *infant* to @entity6 ; a *college* grad , now wants to be oncologist
he says @entity2 can request stay of deportation under new @entity41 plan wednesday
@entity142 : step should be *prelude* to @entity129 passing *reform* that *welcomes* people like @entity2
