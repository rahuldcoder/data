-- on december 23 , 1971 , president @entity1 signed the @entity2 of 1971 into law			1
the legislation had tremendous bipartisan support and came at a time of great optimism			0
many thought its passage would lead to a cure for cancer within a few years			2
the legislation never mentioned the word " war , " but some considered it the country 's " declaration of war on cancer			2
" the law , and the movement supporting it , brought cancer out of the shadows and put a focus on it			1
forty years later , the war is still being waged , and much of the optimism has faded			1
this year , more than 500,000 @entity27 will die of cancer			1
obviously , this is a war not won , and it is appropriate to ask : what have we gotten from this 40 - year war ? today , we know that cancer is far more complicated than imagined in 1971			2
science has provided an amazing understanding of the disease at the cellular and molecular level			0
this understanding is causing medical science to change the definition of cancer from that used since the mid- 1840s with a light microscope to a 21st - century definition based on genetics and genomics			0
the @entity2 of 1971 gave added resources to federally sponsored research , especially those supported by the @entity52 at the @entity53			1
the bill expanded the @entity52 clinical trials network , created @entity52 - designated cancer centers and encouraged cancer specialists to practice in the community			1
most important , the act intended to stimulate basic laboratory research and clinical study and link the two in what is termed translational research			2
forty years later , clinical trials have shown impressive treatment outcomes , especially in the early stage of the disease			1
unfortunately , few cancers can be cured after spreading from their initial site of origin			0
in clinical studies , many of the newer treatments for widespread or metastatic cancer extend median survival by just a few months			2
it is progress but clearly not satisfactory progress			0
improvements in clinical trials methodology allow for better understanding of how to assess screening , diagnostic and treatment interventions rigorously , leading to the realization that some interventions have risks as well as benefits			1
wisdom and caution must be used when employing new technologies			0
the expansion of cancer epidemiology and prevention programs combined with basic science has defined many of the causes of cancer and the ways cancer can be prevented			0
by 1971 , studies had shown that tobacco use causes lung cancer and heart disease			1
further study has linked tobacco use to 14 more cancers and numerous other diseases			0
other established causes of cancer include environmental pollutants and the combination of obesity , high caloric intake and lack of physical activity			0
the act improved @entity27 cancer registries			1
these registries documented the increase in cancer mortality rates through the 1970s and 1980s and the decline since 1991			0
after adjusting for age , the cancer death rate has declined 18.3 % from 1991 to 2008 ( the last year for which data is available )			0
cancer control efforts have saved thousands from dying			0
assuming that the @entity27 cancer death rate would have continued to rise from 1991 onward , as it had in the previous 20 years , these efforts prevented more than 130,000 deaths in 2008 alone			1
this success is largely due to the application of advances in basic , clinical and epidemiologic cancer research findings , both prevention and treatment , largely associated with the @entity2 of 1971			1
research shows that there is still significant potential benefit to cancer prevention			0
more than 20 % of @entity27 still use tobacco , and it is still the leading cause of cancer			1
there has been a dramatic rise in the rate of obesity over the past 40 years			0
the triad of obesity , poor nutrition and lack of physical activity could emerge as the leading cause of cancer in the @entity27 over the next decade			1
indeed , most upsetting is that research shows a substantial number of @entity27 are not benefiting from the advances resulting from the @entity2			1
while it is estimated that 130,000 cancer deaths were prevented in the @entity27 in 2008 , it is also estimated that 200,000 additional deaths were avoidable			2
these people died because a substantial proportion of @entity27 get less than optimal preventive health care , and when diagnosed with cancer , a substantial number receive less than adequate treatment			1
these are deaths that would not have occurred if the fruits of research , known knowledge in cancer prevention , screening and treatment technologies , had been fully available and applied to the entire population			2
the casualty count is where the " war on cancer " analogy breaks down			0
in war , more than 200,000 avoidable deaths in one year is an unacceptable outrage			0
in the war on cancer , it is just forgotten			0
we need to recommit to the anti-cancer effort ; we need to work to get every @entity27 the quality health care every human deserves			2
on the 40th anniversary of the " declaration of war on cancer , " the most pertinent question in cancer research is not one of molecular or cell biology			0
it is " how do we get adequate high quality health care to include preventive care to the people who deserve it ? " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dr. @entity206 .			1
