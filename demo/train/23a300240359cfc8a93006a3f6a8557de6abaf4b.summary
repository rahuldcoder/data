-- despite being recently branded a " rotten apple " by @entity4 owner @entity3 , @entity1 was treated to a rapturous reception on his return to the northern @entity8 city			1
with votes at stake in the @entity8 elections -- @entity12 estimates the signing of " @entity1 " could be worth 400,000 votes as @entity3 attempts a political comeback -- his new boss ' blunt assessment was quickly forgotten as the former @entity8 prime minister sanctioned a $ 30 million deal to sign @entity1			1
his transfer ends the striker 's whirlwind two - and - half - year stay with @entity25 champions @entity24 , during which time a litany of dust - ups have allowed @entity1 to become a caricature of the modern playboy footballer -- sporting talent and tabloid cult hero rolled into one			1
one of his final acts as a @entity24 player was a training ground brawl with team manager @entity39 , pictures of which were sprawled across newspapers			1
in the aftermath of the dust - up , @entity1 's teammate @entity41 offered to counsel the 22 - year - old striker			1
when @entity41 , infamous for refusing to come off the substitutes bench during a match last season and subsequently going awol for three months , is doling out advise , it might be to seriously consider where your career is headed			1
having signed a four - and - a - half - year deal , @entity1 's future now lies back in @entity4 , where he rose to prominence with @entity4 's city rivals @entity54 between 2006 and 2010			1
@entity56 stories -- both mythical and true -- surround @entity1 , who recently unveiled a head of bleach - blonde hair ahead of a match between second - place @entity24 and @entity60			1
there 's the one about @entity1 driving into a women 's prison , or the time he reportedly threw darts at youth team players out of a training ground window -- not to mention the impromptu bonfire which burned down his bathroom hours before he became the face of a firework safety campaign			1
or @entity1 being stopped by police for having thousands of pounds in a bag on the passenger seat of his car			1
his alleged response when inquisitive officers asked why he was carrying such a huge amount of cash was to say : " because i 'm rich			2
" outrageous talent @entity24 showed admirable patience with their mercurial marksman , hoping he could consistently produce the form which saw him spearhead @entity8 's run to the final of @entity85			1
@entity1 endured a tempestuous relationship with former @entity54 coach and current @entity89 boss @entity87 , but in @entity39 , also a one - time coach of the @entity8 international at the @entity54 , he found a staunch ally , though the city manager used the striker with increasing sparsity			1
it 's this mix of lashings of outrageous talent , outlandish behavior and childish ill - discipline -- @entity1 has already picked up six red cards in his fledgling career -- which have made him a gold mine for newspapers			1
@entity104 is one former player who has experienced the high of being at a leading club and the low of languishing in the game 's lesser leagues			1
born in @entity110 , @entity104 was raised in @entity111 -- representing his adoptive country at under - 21 level -- before he was snapped up by @entity8 giants @entity114 as a teenager			1
a bright future was predicted for the striker , but after leaving @entity114 in 2002 he moved to @entity25 and spent a decade slowly falling through the leagues			1
he made five appearances for sixth - tier club @entity120 before retiring from football in 2012 , aged just 29			1
since quitting the game , @entity104 has set up @entity123 , a business aimed at helping foreign players settle within the @entity25 game			2
" the organization is the sum of my own experiences , " the former @entity128 and @entity129 player told @entity0			2
" we want to stop players wasting their talent			2
we should support and understand what makes him behave the way he does , instead of judging him and saying he is a lunatic or he is not bothered , " added @entity104 , referring to @entity1 , who is of @entity137 heritage and was born in @entity138 and raised by an adoptive family in @entity140 in northern @entity8			1
" all the problems relate to the social side of being a human being and how you interact with other people and how you interact with a new culture and how you adapt to it			2
" football clubs are experts when it comes to keeping a player in peak physical condition , but @entity104 is convinced the game has room for improvement when it comes to addressing issues of mental well - being			2
" a player spends 80 % of his time outside of the club 's supervision and only 20 % inside of the club , " continued the @entity111			2
" it is one thing to look at how a player is physically , but the mental well being of a player is just as important			0
it can be the difference between teams going up , getting relegated or reaching the @entity176			0
" the mind plays a massive part in a player 's development and performance and this is something clubs need to tap into if they want to increase their chances of winning			0
" the view that talent alone is not enough is one which is widely supported by sports psychologists			0
that is an approach not lost on five - time @entity191 champions @entity190			0
as part of a new philosophy adapted by manager @entity195 , -- appointed at @entity196 in june last year -- the club recruited dr @entity197 , who helped hone the minds of @entity201 's all - conquering @entity200 cyclists			1
" it is absolutely vital that young players are given support right from the start , " said @entity202 , sport psychologist from @entity201 organization @entity203 , who argues the amount of psychological support available to footballers decreases as they progress into the first team			0
the @entity213 ( @entity213 ) , a body which represents the interests of soccer players in @entity25 and @entity217 , was not available for comment when contacted by @entity0			0
" the transition from an academy into a senior squad is a really significant time , " continued @entity202			0
" i do n't think enough emphasis is put on providing support to players during this transition and then throughout their professional career			2
" while the access to support is a lot better compared to 10 years ago there is a lot of work still to do , especially in football			0
" with clubs in @entity25 's top division receiving unprecedented levels of income -- the recent sale of @entity239 television rights domestically and internationally is set to generate more than $ 8 billion according to @entity201 media reports -- @entity202 sees no reason why mental health professionals should not be given a higher profile at clubs			0
" do n't get me wrong there is some great work being done by organisations such as the @entity213 ; @entity247 and the like			0
but appropriately qualified internal backroom staff fully integrated within a club is essential			2
" breaking into a top - flight team can transform a young player 's life as they are exposed to the pressures of a voracious 24/7 media and experience a level of financial wealth which they previously would have probably only dreamed of			0
while sudden monetary gain itself might not destabilize a player , an inability to manage their finances in the long term might , suggests @entity266 -- a sports psychologist specializing in football			0
" i think its more having a capacity to deal with the wealth which comes to them , " said @entity266			0
" over time , if you 're not doing that , it can create pressure			0
" the club needs to produce a culture of excellence , " added @entity266			2
" the five cs -- culture ; confidence , commitment , cohesion and caring			0
" many people would baulk at the last one			0
they might become multimillionaire footballers , but the only way they get there is if they have emotional and intellectual support			0
" after a career which shares some parallels with that of @entity1 , what advice would @entity290 -- with the benefit of hindsight -- offer to the @entity8 ? " to seek help and accept help that will allow him to fulfil your potential and play until 35 and maybe be the best player in the world , " he answered			1
" with everything surrounding him , that is not going to happen			0
accept the help that people are giving			0
over to you @entity310 .			0
