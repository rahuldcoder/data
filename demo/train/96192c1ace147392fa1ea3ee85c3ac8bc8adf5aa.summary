@entity0 , @entity1 -- from the original celebrity endorser @entity5 to modern - day superstars such as @entity7 and @entity8 , the humble football boot has come a long way			1
@entity11 's notorious wife - beheading royal paid four shillings -- the equivalent of $ 1,350 in today 's money -- for his custom - made leather pair that were in an inventory of his wardrobe when he died in 1547			1
by comparison , @entity19 's new @entity18 is the most expensive boot on the modern retail market , coming in at around $ 400			1
@entity5 's boots would have been sturdy models made from tough leather to cope with the violent , no - rules , all - in - brawl approach to the game of the 16th century , a far cry from the streamlined and lightweight shoes designed for today 's game			1
" we have a revolutionary technology which has a stud that adapts to different pitch conditions , " @entity19 design director @entity32 told @entity2			1
" this will make the fastest player even faster whatever the pitch conditions might be			0
for a modern footballer who 's really fast , this is really going to change his game			2
" the birth of boot - making giants from workers knocking about in brutal steel - caps , the evolution of boots really kicked off in the late 1880s when nailed - in leather studs helped with traction in muddy fields			2
in 1948 , a falling - out between the two @entity53 siblings behind the @entity54 led to the creation of @entity56 and @entity57 -- the two most influential boot makers until the emergence of @entity19 in the 1980s			1
both companies laid claim to the invention of the screw - in synthetic stud			2
@entity66 ( " @entity67 " ) @entity65 's company said his firm 's innovation helped @entity53 win the 1954 @entity70 when treacherously wet weather struck before the final against @entity73 , but brother @entity74 insisted @entity57 's @entity76 boot featured interchangeable studs years previously			1
two decades later , @entity57 struck an important blow by signing up the world 's greatest player , @entity79 , for $ 125,000 , according to a book by @entity83 author @entity82			1
at the opening game of the 1970 @entity70 , the @entity86 legend asked the referee to delay starting the match so he could tie up his laces -- meaning valuable exposure for @entity57 as the world 's television cameras focused in on the player 's feet , @entity84 wrote in " @entity57			1
" @entity79 's @entity97 range was also worn in the 1980s by @entity99 superstar @entity98 , giving the company an association with two of the best players to have graced the sport , says @entity105 of specialist web site @entity107			2
enter the @entity108 but @entity56 consolidated their position at the top of the boot market thanks to a much lesser - known player			1
@entity113 , born in @entity114 and raised in @entity115 , made his name with @entity1 club @entity117 in the 1980s			2
after retiring at the relatively young age of 27 to look after his ill sister , @entity113 came up with the novel idea of adding rubber patches to the outside of boots , which boosted control of the ball and gave added swerve when kicking it			0
" i was coaching kids in @entity115 and i was telling them that they had to grip and bite into the ball like a table tennis bat to swerve it			0
' that 's fine mr @entity113 , ' they said , ' but our boots are made of leather and not rubber , it 's raining and they are slippery , ' " he told @entity11 's @entity130 web site			1
" i went home and took the rubber off a table tennis bat and stuck it on my boots with super glue			0
immediately i went outside again and kicked the ball , i could hear a squeak when the rubber engaged with the polyurethane of the ball			0
" the result , after years of development , was the @entity108			2
launched in 1994 , it has been worn by superstar names such as @entity152 and @entity153 -- both of whom had customized versions			0
@entity113 , ironically , has recently been a critic of modern boots , saying they contribute to injuries suffered by players			0
" people say that the boots do n't provide enough protection			0
in fact , the opposite is true , " he told @entity163 in 2009			0
" the problem is that the boots are so well made there is no give at all in the materials -- especially the cheaper synthetics			0
" the pitches are now so well - maintained and even woven with synthetic materials that the players ' studs engage like they should do , but they do n't release enough , causing injury			0
also , the studs are far too long and give far too much grip			0
" a new major player in the market the next most significant boot was @entity19 's @entity18 , @entity105 said , launched in 1998 with the endorsement of @entity183 @entity70 winner @entity7			1
that range 's popularity is expected to continue with the @entity18 , worn by @entity187 's @entity186 superstar @entity7 -- the planet 's most expensive player at $ 130 million -- at the @entity70 in @entity114			1
@entity32 said the design took a painstaking three years			2
" we really started from scratch on this boot , " he said			2
" it 's a long process			0
every change you make , you have to make a sample then you have to test it on the pitch , test it in a lab , and make sure it provides a benefit			0
" the process starts with a small core team who focus on what needs improving from the previous boot , @entity32 said , gathering input from players and seeking out the latest technical innovations			0
" once you get onto the manufacturing side there 's obviously larger development teams that come into it , " he said			0
" a lot of people touch it through its life cycle , but there 's quite a small core team who work on the real essence of the design and what it 's about			0
" while @entity32 is proud of the @entity18 's new adaptable retraction system , which can change and extend automatically , @entity56 have also unleashed an innovative new product before the @entity70 -- even daring to revamp the traditional three - stripe design in a boot that changes color in different light			1
the @entity230 is the lightest football boot on the market , @entity105 says , with 2009 world player of the year @entity8 's @entity234 spearheading the range			1
" it 's the fastest and lightest football shoe that we 've ever created , " @entity56 senior product manager for footwear @entity237 told @entity2			1
" we 've talked to the players , professionals and amateurs , and their message was very simple : make me faster			0
" the goal was simple , the challenge was very difficult			0
never before have so many players felt , touched , tested , seen and thought about the product			0
" who rules the roost ? the leading companies are coy about releasing boot market figures , but @entity105 believes @entity56 is a clear leader from @entity19 -- last year the firm claimed it had a 50 percent share in @entity257 and @entity53			1
@entity258 - based @entity19 , however , is regarded the no. 1 sportswear company , he said			1
and it may be team shirts and balls , rather than boots , which prove to be the biggest money - earner at the @entity70 , according to @entity53 - based marketing consultancy @entity265			1
" as the sale of boots is still the core business , both companies are trying hard to sign the world 's best football players to endorse their products , " consultant @entity267 told @entity2			1
" however , although boots are the right tool to promote the reliability and the technology of the brands , in terms of sales the @entity70 shows a different trend			2
" during the event , fans tend to show commitment to their own national teams by purchasing the official jersey and the official ball rather than the boots of their favorite football players			0
this is probably the most profitable line of business during the @entity70 for both @entity56 and @entity19			1
" new avenues : the internet @entity56 has guaranteed maximum exposure in @entity114 by buying up exclusive sponsorship rights , forcing @entity19 to continue the more innovative tactics it started with 2006 's " @entity298 " social networking - style web site			1
" now @entity19 is trying to pursue a long - term strategy : no more single campaigns but the activation of more comprehensive marketing , especially via the @entity294 , " @entity267 said			2
" for instance , @entity19 is deeply involved in @entity306 ( @entity306 ) activities with the latest campaign , " lace up , @entity307 , " endorsed by important athletes			2
the aim is to lend more credibility and reliability to the brand			0
" the internet is soon going to be a major resource for the kit suppliers more and more , and new innovative campaigns should be expected on the web			0
