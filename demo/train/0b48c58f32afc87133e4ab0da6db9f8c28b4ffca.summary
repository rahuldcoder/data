@entity0 -- the @entity4 press should be regulated by an independent group supported by law and with the power to fine , a judge recommended thursday in a long - awaited report sparked by a phone - hacking scandal at @entity10 's @entity12 tabloid			1
judge @entity13 said he was not recommending that @entity14 set up a press regulator , but that the industry should create its own , which would be backed by legislation to make sure it meets certain standards of independence and effectiveness			1
prime minister @entity21 , who asked the judge to prepare the report , told @entity14 after its release that he agrees with @entity13 's recommendations for a new , strong , independent press regulator			1
he said the onus is now on the press to implement the report 's recommendations , " and implement them radically			1
" @entity1 : @entity4 press react to hacking report but @entity21 said he is not convinced that legislation is needed to underpin the new body -- and he has serious concerns about taking that approach			1
at the same time , the prime minister said that the " status quo is not an option " and that the victims of press abuses have " suffered in a way that we can barely begin to imagine			2
" @entity44 , a subsidiary of the @entity10 - owned @entity45 , backed @entity21 's call for regulation without legislation			1
" we accept that a new system should be independent , have a standards code , a means of resolving disputes , the power to demand prominent apologies and the ability to levy heavy fines , " the company said in a statement			2
signaling a difference of views within the coalition government , deputy prime minister @entity58 , who leads the @entity59 , said he believes new legislation is needed to ensure the regulator 's long - term independence			1
@entity66 , leader of the opposition @entity67 , also said he favors full implementation of @entity13 's recommendations , including the new legislation			1
cross-party talks are expected later thursday to discuss a way forward			1
read the report summary ( @entity74 ) in his report , @entity13 said that he had no desire to jeopardize the freedom of the press , which he acknowledged plays a " vital " role in safeguarding the public interest , but that changes are needed to tackle abuses			1
the @entity4 press has ignored its own code of conduct on " far too many occasions over the last decade , " causing " real hardship " and sometimes wreaking " havoc with the lives of innocent people , " @entity13 said			1
" this is not just the famous but ordinary members of the public , caught up in events ( many of them , truly tragic ) far larger than they could cope with but made much , much worse by press behavior that , at times , can only be described as outrageous , " he said			2
at the same time , no one proposed that the government or @entity14 should be involved in regulating the press , @entity13 said			1
the judge recommends that the new body have new powers to impose tough sanctions against newspapers that break the rules , including the imposition of fines of up to 1 % of turnover , to a maximum of 1 million pounds ( $ 1.6 million )			0
opinion : why the @entity4 should avoid muzzling its free press the judge said the relationship between the press and politicians is mostly " robust , " but sometimes the links can be " too close			2
" he highlighted as a concern " relationships between policy makers and those in the media who stand to gain or lose from the policy being considered			0
" this risks undermining public confidence in the press and politicians , he said			2
@entity21 said he accepted that more transparency was needed over such links			2
but the prime minister pointed out that @entity13 had " emphatically " rejected allegations that the @entity128 had struck some kind of deal with @entity44			2
this related to claims that its newspapers might have offered favorable coverage to @entity21 in the expectation of " policy favors			2
" @entity21 's government faced uncomfortable questions earlier this year over its handling of a bid by @entity10 's @entity45 to take over @entity4 satellite broadcaster @entity142			1
the bid was eventually dropped			0
opinion : why @entity4 's shamed newspapers need regulating the prime minister also backed @entity13 's recommendations to break an " excessively cozy relationship " between the police and the press			1
@entity13 said there was a perception that some senior police officers within @entity0 's @entity154 were too close to @entity44			1
but he found no evidence that decisions to limit its earlier inquiries into phone hacking were due to undue influence or corruption			0
@entity13 said senior police officers should ensure greater transparency over their meetings with the press in the future , and they should not be able to move immediately from the police into jobs in the media			1
the @entity154 said that the integrity of its officers had not been questioned but that it would study the criticisms made in the report			0
commissioner @entity173 said he had already taken " decisive action " to address issues that emerged during the inquiry			0
" our priority now is the victims of phone hacking and making sure they get justice , " he said			0
opinion : press dishes it out , but can it take it ? @entity13 described his inquiry , which heard from hundreds of witnesses during eight months of hearings , as " the most concentrated look at the press this country has ever seen			1
" those testifying included politicians including @entity21 and former prime ministers @entity195 and @entity197 ; police and media players such as @entity10 ; and victims of press abuses			1
the inquiry was first announced by @entity21 in july 2011 in response to public outrage over a newspaper phone - hacking scandal			2
the trigger was the allegation that in 2002 , the voice mail of a missing 13 - year - old girl , @entity210 , had been hacked by an investigator working for the @entity12 newspaper before she was found murdered			0
compounding the anger was the claim ( later dismissed by police ) that messages were deleted by him from the schoolgirl 's full voice mail box , giving her parents false hope that she was alive			2
the furor forced the closure of the 168 - year - old @entity12 , owned by @entity44			0
it also prompted a new appetite among @entity4 's public and political establishments to see the sleazy underbelly of ( often tabloid ) reporting exposed and steps taken to clean up the media 's act			0
@entity13 's report was the subject of much speculation before its release			1
freedom of expression groups warned of a potential impacts on freedom of speech , while campaigners for greater controls said regulation is essential			0
the chairman of the @entity242 , @entity243 , said he did not agree with all @entity13 's recommendations but all those involved must seek to unite around " common ground			1
" " we all agree that we must regain the trust and confidence of the @entity4 people to make sure that unacceptable , outrageous and illegal behavior can never be allowed to happen again , " @entity243 said in a written statement			0
the @entity252 issued a release saying it is " deeply concerned " about the recommendations			0
" a media regulatory body anchored by statute can not be described as voluntary , " the committee 's executive director , @entity257 , said in the release			0
" moreover , adopting statutory regulation would undermine press freedom in the @entity4 and give legitimacy to governments around the world that routinely silence journalists through such controls			0
" @entity268 , a free speech group , urged " serious , considered debate " about the points made by @entity13			2
chief executive @entity272 said : " we share @entity21 's concerns that statutory underpinning would undermine free speech , and could be the start of a slippery slope of government interference in the media			1
" media reform campaign group hacked @entity283 launched an online petition that calls on the leaders of the three main parties to implement the @entity288 's recommendations in full " as soon as possible			0
" timeline of the @entity4 phone hacking scandal the actions of staffers at @entity45 and @entity44 came under close scrutiny during the inquiry			0
among those to testify were @entity10 protege @entity296 , former chief executive of @entity44 and onetime editor of the @entity299 and @entity12 , and @entity300 , who also edited the @entity12			0
he went on to become @entity21 's director of communications before resigning from that post early last year			1
both appeared in court thursday morning to face charges of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office in connection with alleged illegal payments to public officials			0
they and three other accused were released on bail and ordered to appear in court again next week			0
the scandal has also raised the specter of possible legal action against @entity45 staffers in the @entity318 under the @entity319 , which outlaws the bribery of foreign officials by @entity318 firms			0
however , analyst @entity323 in @entity324 said the release of the @entity13 report is " a nonevent " from the point of view of @entity318 investors and would have no real impact on @entity45 stocks			2
the corporation is doing well and @entity10 has come back " stronger than ever " following the pressure he was under to cede control of parts of his media empire early this year , @entity323 said			0
@entity1 's @entity338 and @entity339 contributed to this report .			0
