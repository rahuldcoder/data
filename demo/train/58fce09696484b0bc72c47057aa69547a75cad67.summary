@entity0 -- race and politics are a combustible combo that explodes into headlines when an ex-president lights the fuse , as @entity8 did recently			1
president @entity9 during the 2008 campaign faced questions over race and politics			1
" when a radical fringe element of demonstrators and others begin to attack the president of the @entity22 as an animal or as a reincarnation of @entity25 or when they wave signs in the air that said we should have buried @entity9 with @entity29 , those kinds of things are beyond the bounds , " the @entity13 told students at @entity15 on wednesday			1
" i think people who are guilty of that kind of personal attack against @entity9 have been influenced to a major degree by a belief that he should not be president because he happens to be @entity38 , " he added			1
the controversy erupted this week when @entity8 first raised the race issue to @entity41			1
" an overwhelming portion of the intensely demonstrated animosity toward president @entity9 is based on the fact that he is a black man , " he said			1
@entity46 , a black comedian and actor , said wednesday in a written statement that he agrees with @entity8			2
" during president @entity9 's speech on the status of health care reform , some members of @entity50 engaged in a public display of disrespect , " he said			1
@entity1 contributor @entity56 said that some of the allegations of race - baiting might have some weight among @entity63 voters			1
" @entity8 , i 'm afraid , is not alone in his views , " he said			2
but @entity56 warns that the racists tend to be on the fringes of the right and do not reflect on the greater field of opponents to @entity9 's ideology			2
" but i think it 's wrongheaded , and i think it 's unfair , and i think it 's indeed a libel upon many of the opponents , most of the opponents of health care reform , to say that they 're racist , " he said			0
" seven previous presidents have tried to bring health care reforms of this kind			0
and , as i recall , all seven were white			0
" @entity8 's comments , though , are the kind that raise people 's defenses			2
in particular , they turn off independents , who by nature tend to hate the hard edges of politics			0
the @entity95 , for its part , wants no part of the @entity8 controversy			1
" the president does not believe that that criticism comes based on the color of his skin , " said @entity95 press secretary @entity98			1
as a candidate , @entity9 understood the political danger in letting his race become a major topic			1
he largely avoided it when he could , but race was always a subtext , as it is now in his presidency			2
" but i can also say , frankly , that this @entity95 and even his campaign were very afraid to even go down this road dealing with anything with race , " said @entity1 contributor @entity111			1
@entity8 also told @entity41 that there is an " inherent feeling among many people in this country that an @entity38 ought not to be president and ought not to be given the same respect as if he were white			2
" framing criticism as racism cropped up several times during the campaign			0
when @entity128 , a @entity129 supporter , said during the 2008 @entity63 primaries that @entity9 would never have gotten as far as he had if he had not been black , candidate @entity9 pointedly left race out of it			2
" i think that her comments were ridiculous , " @entity9 said at the time			0
but @entity128 blamed @entity9 supporters for her hate mail , saying " i have been called all kinds of names			0
and the attacks are ageist			0
" ireport.com : freedom from speech ? and the topic of race even came to haunt @entity129 , the so - called first black president			0
before the @entity146 primary in january 2008 , @entity129 told an audience that " there 's no difference in [ @entity9 's ] voting record and @entity151 's ever since			0
this whole thing is the biggest fairy tale i have ever seen			0
" some interpreted that as belittling @entity9 's campaign			0
after much criticism , @entity129 later said he was talking about @entity9 's opposition to the war in @entity161 , not his campaign			2
but those two words -- " fairy tale " -- launched weeks worth of accusations , sometimes on the front page of the @entity167 , that the @entity168 were playing the race card			0
ireport.com : share your thoughts on race and politics some observers said @entity8 's statement was far too broad , and that many of the attacks on @entity9 are about policy , not race			1
" i do n't think one can paint a broad brush in saying that all of these folks who have criticism , anybody who criticizes the president ... is based upon the issue of race , " @entity111 said			1
@entity188 , a @entity1 contributor and @entity190 strategist , said @entity8 's criticism is " absurd			1
" " it 's very dangerous politics , " she said			0
" @entity9 got , in the last election , more white male voters than any of his predecessors			0
... republicans and conservatives and @entity63 and liberals , the whole country felt very good putting -- setting aside policies after his election			0

former president @entity8 says criticism of @entity9 is largely based on race
@entity9 does n't believe criticism is based on color of his skin , *spokesman* says
@entity1 contributor : @entity8 should n't paint such broad *strokes* on racism
@entity190 strategist says all the racism controversy is " absurd "
