@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was never @entity4 's intention to become a race car driver , although her parents may have had an inkling when , as a 12 - year - old , she took her mother 's @entity9 on a joyride			1
the @entity13 - born former model came to racing late , aged 24 , and since then , has become one of motorsport 's most prolific and versatile female drivers , racing all over the world at speeds often exceeding 200 miles per hour			1
in a sport dominated by men , she has more than one hundred races and eight major wins to her credit , including an overall win at road racing 's @entity25 in 2004 and a second - place finish in the @entity29 endurance race in 2007			1
road racing is a term used to describe types of motorsport which take place on purpose - built tarmac tracks			1
now , @entity4 is determined to become the first @entity37 woman to compete in @entity38 , the major @entity40 stock car racing series			1
sponsors willing , she says she will compete in the @entity42 this year			1
a stock car is a car that 's customized for racing			1
there are few major league professional sports where men and women compete directly , and stock car racing is expensive , competitive and potentially lethal			1
@entity4 has already cracked a rib and a tooth this season , after a broadside hit from another car at full speed in an @entity59 stock - car series race at @entity60 in @entity61			1
but , she tells @entity2 , " i like the difficult challenge			0
everything hard to get -- i like that			0
" @entity4 has driven a variety of cars during her career and has constantly had to master new skills -- but her love of learning is abundant			1
a former naval engineer , she has master 's degrees in @entity74 , @entity75 , and is currently also learning to pilot speedboats and helicopters			1
here she shares with @entity2 the life lessons race car driving has taught her			1
forget the competition and focus on your goal ... there are 42 other cars that want to win the race , too , and they have more experience than me , but it does n't matter			2
do everything with determination and passion			0
when you feel clear about what you want , you have a high probability of being successful			0
have confidence in your team ; have confidence in yourself ... whether you are a race car driver or working as an engineer or in an office , you have to see what you want , and believe that you can do it			1
you have to have confidence in your team , and if you are working alone , you have to have confidence in yourself			0
if you have this mentality , you can get what you want in any area			0
@entity106 boss : @entity107 helps women succeed at work work as hard as it takes ... i did four master 's degrees -- three simultaneously			1
i was in two universities at the same time			0
i started two ( degrees during the day ) and then one at night			2
it was crazy with all the books on the table			0
i 'd cry sometimes and say , ' how can i finish that ? ' and i would just calm down and start doing things little by little			0
it was my focus : all my energy went into my education at that time			0
success relies on multiple factors ... it 's not only gas and brake like people think			2
you have to know so much about the car , check the computer for the latest information , give the right information to the engineer so he can make the right adjustment			2
in the end , you need so many things working right to win the race			2
@entity140 female entrepreneurs exploit changing attitudes gender does n't matter -- success does ... it does n't matter if you are a woman or a man			2
the important thing is your ability , your intelligence and your determination -- how strong you are			0
in racing , you have to drive the same fast car , you have to be good like the others			2
when you put the helmet on , it does n't matter if you are woman or man : your mission is to compete to win			2
talk to your seniors as much as you can ... all the time , i 'm talking ( to the crew chief ) , because it 's the only way to learn -- from people that have more experience than you			0
small improvements can equal big victories ... i always want a faster car			0
always , we are looking for more and more and more			0
all the practice ... is just to find some tenth of a second .			0
