@entity0 -- the @entity2 began formal debate thursday on a new nuclear arms treaty with @entity5 , a top presidential priority that conservative @entity7 had tried to block in the current lame - duck session of @entity9			1
however , the chamber moved on to other issues on thursday night , leaving open the question of when it would vote on ratifying the pact			0
with the current lame - duck session of @entity9 approaching conclusion , @entity15 were trying to make progress on considering the treaty despite a @entity7 threat to block any legislation brought up before the @entity2 acts on a measure authorizing continued government spending			1
on wednesday , senators voted 66 - 32 to take up the @entity25 , known as @entity26 , which would resume mutual inspections of @entity29 and @entity5 nuclear arsenals while limiting both nations to 1,550 warheads and 700 launchers each			1
the accord cleared the @entity34 in september , and has been endorsed by some leading @entity7 figures , including former president @entity36 and sen. @entity37 of @entity38 , the ranking @entity7 member of foreign relations panel			2
in a recent @entity49 editorial , five big guns of @entity7 foreign policy -- former secretaries of state @entity42 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 -- urged their fellow republicans to support the treaty , which they say is " is clearly in our national interest			2
" republicans had pledged to block consideration of any other legislative items until passage of both the spending measure and a tax package negotiated by the @entity60 and congressional @entity7			0
the current resolution authorizing government spending runs out saturday , requiring congressional approval of a new one to cover the rest of the fiscal year			0
@entity67 said thursday the @entity2 will remain in session to complete its work , even it means cutting into the upcoming holiday recess originally scheduled to begin saturday			0
debate on the @entity26 accord could resume friday and continue next week , he said , adding that @entity7 can offer amendments if desired			2
@entity67 has insisted that he has sufficient support to ratify the treaty			0
but some @entity2 @entity7 have opposed bringing the measure up with so little time left in the lame - duck session			2
sen. @entity79 , @entity80 , told reporters wednesday that a rushed schedule to debate the treaty would prevent @entity7 senators from being able to offer substantive amendments that require serious debate			1
he expressed " great frustration and disappointment " with what he called the refusal of @entity67 and @entity2 @entity15 to put off the debate until there is time to do it properly in the new @entity9 that convenes in early january			1
however , @entity15 said @entity79 and @entity7 have been given plenty of opportunities to discuss and influence the treaty , and now must show that they truly want it to go forward instead of continuing to delay it			1
ratification requires support from two - thirds of the @entity2 , or 67 votes			0
@entity15 currently control 58 seats and need nine republicans for ratification			0
in the new congressional session , the @entity15 will have only 53 seats and would need 14 @entity7 votes to ratify the treaty			1
@entity1 's @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 contributed to this report .			0
