-- shortly after @entity3 's rout of @entity4 there was one word that many on the field seemed not to want to broach			1
but why not ? @entity3 's 42 to 14 thrashing of @entity4 in monday night 's @entity9 national championship game was the @entity3 's second in a row			1
it is also @entity3 's third national title in the last four years			1
is n't this a dynasty , a reporter asked @entity3 quarterback @entity17 , moments after he led his team to the win ? " you can call us whatever you want but this was a total team effort , " @entity17 said			1
@entity3 coach @entity24 also shied away from the d - word during a news conference after the game			1
" i do n't think words like dynasty are words that i have much interest in			2
that is for other people to speak about , " @entity24 said			0
and many on social media were			0
" i really believe that this is , in my lifetime , the best dynasty that i 've ever seen in college football , " @entity37 personality @entity35 tweeted about @entity3			1
@entity35 's comment was retweeted thousands of times			0
in fact , " @entity49 " was trending in many regions in the @entity45 early tuesday morning as @entity3 fans partied in the streets of @entity48			1
with the win , @entity3 joins college football royalty			1
the team joins @entity53 , in the ' 90s , and @entity4 , in the ' 40s , as the only teams to win three championships in four years			1
when @entity53 did it , they shared the 1997 championship with @entity59			0
and to add to @entity3 's legacy , none of the championship games were really close			1
in 2010 , @entity3 stomped @entity63 37 to 21			1
last year , the @entity3 blanked @entity64 21 to 0			1
and this year , the championship game felt like it was over at halftime			0
game ? what game ? there 's a pretty woman in the stands ! the no. 2 @entity3 scored on drives of 82 , 61 and 80 yards against the top - ranked and undefeated @entity74 in its first three drives of the game			1
they drove 71 - yards and scored with 31 seconds left in the half to take a dominating 28 - 0 lead			0
by that time , despite the fact that half of the game was yet to be played , many of those commenting on @entity83 were jokingly wondering if @entity4 would come out of the locker room for the second half			0
the @entity74 did , but it did not get much better for them			0
in fact , one of the biggest hits of the game on @entity3 's quarterback @entity17 came from his own teammate , @entity92			2
the two teammates disagreed on a play call and had to call a timeout to get it cleared up			0
@entity17 got in his lineman 's face and @entity92 pushed him some three yards back , a feat that @entity4 could never do throughout the game			0
@entity4 also could n't stop @entity3 's running game			2
@entity3 runners @entity101 and @entity103 both ran for more than 100 yards			2
@entity74 head coach @entity104 said his team had a lot to learn from @entity3			1
" we are not there yet , " @entity104 said			0
" @entity3 showed us that in the way they played the game			2
we got a lot of work left to do to get back here			0
" but there was one player from @entity3 who was ready to put the crown on			2
" i think i can use the word dynasty now , " said linebacker @entity117 , shortly after the confetti fell on the field			0
" three titles in four years , that is a dynasty			2
" @entity125 coverage of the national title game @entity0 's @entity127 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 wins its third @entity9 title in four years
the team joins two other teams in college football *history* to complete that feat
" this is , in my lifetime , the best dynasty that i 've ever seen in college football , " @entity37 commentator says
