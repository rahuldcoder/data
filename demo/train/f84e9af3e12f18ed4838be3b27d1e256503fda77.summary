" it 's a wonderful day for them and their families , " the president said			2
another @entity131 let go weeks earlier the @entity0 ' departure from @entity2 comes less than a month after @entity2 released @entity133 , an @entity134 man who spent five months in detention			2
@entity2 authorities took @entity133 into custody after he left a @entity138 at a club in the northern part of the country			2
@entity9 had been held since late 2012 , and in april 2013 was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for " hostile acts " against the @entity2 government			1

@entity0 detained in @entity2 talk to @entity20 the interviews -- which @entity20 learned about only after being shuttled on a van to a secret location -- were monitored and recorded by @entity2 officials			0

it also asked @entity2 to work with the south on humanitarian issues , such as family reunification			2
ex-diplomat : @entity2 may want to thaw @entity0 relations @entity20 could not independently confirm details of the three @entity0 ' detention or other facts about their cases , in part because of the secrecy that defines much of @entity2 's dealings with the world			0
that includes the @entity206 nation 's much - maligned quest to develop nuclear weapons , something that has put it at odds with the @entity0 , @entity184 and many other countries around the world			0
@entity2 has been subject to stringent international sanctions aimed at curbing its nuclear aspirations			0
the @entity19 official said that @entity9 and @entity10 's release is " unrelated " to other @entity0 issues involving @entity2			1
who is @entity9 ? the @entity0 welcomes the move , but if @entity2 wants a better relationship with the world it needs to " show it is serious and prepared to abide by its commitments , particularly concerning denuclearization , " the official said			1
" and they must take significant steps to improve their human rights record			0
" @entity228 , the author of " @entity229 : @entity2 takes on the @entity233 , " opines something must have changed in @entity16 's philosophy to justify releasing three @entity131 detainees in less than a month			1
" i think right now there is a charm offensive , " @entity228 told @entity20			0
@entity236 , a former @entity0 ambassador to the @entity237 who tried to win @entity9 's release during a 2013 visit to @entity2 , echoed that view , saying , " they are sending a message to the @entity0 that ' we 're ready to talk			1
' " he added that no decision this big would have been made without the approval of @entity23 , who took over as @entity2 's absolute leader following the death of his father , @entity249 , in 2011			0
" it appears that it is a good move by the @entity2 to restart the @entity131 relationship , which has been in a really deep freeze , " said @entity236			0
former basketball star @entity253 , who has been criticized for his chumminess with @entity2 's leader , said in statement saturday that his trips to the country influenced @entity9 's release			1
