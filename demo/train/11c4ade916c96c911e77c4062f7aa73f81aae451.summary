-- getting a song to hit in the summer can change a career -- just ask @entity3 or @entity4			1
before the reign of " @entity12 " in the summer of 2008 , @entity5 had been tirelessly striving to create a name for herself in the music industry and was starting to find some long - sought success with her debut single , " @entity10			2
" but right around @entity14 2008 -- which reminds us to make the most of what 's left of the season -- @entity5 's loud and bold " @entity12 " pushed through to the no. 1 spot on @entity21 's @entity20 and refused to let go for seven weeks			0
that single gave @entity5 an entree as pop 's newest princess			0
as for @entity4 ? he 'll tell you himself that his 2013 single with @entity27 and @entity28 , the controversial " @entity30 , " ushered in a new era , creating the kind of success of which most artists can only dream			1
@entity4 had been working as a singer and songwriter for years when " @entity30 " arrived in the spring of 2013			1
but after that song was played at every pool party , barbecue , nightclub and wedding reception -- topping the @entity21 100 in late june and staying there until september -- @entity4 became a global pop star			1
having the song of the summer does n't always translate into album sales later			2
@entity4 's latest release , the lovelorn " @entity47 , " has performed dismally			1
but it is a fast and easy way to gain notoriety , even if it only lasts for the season			0
so who 's going to claim the title for 2014 ? the obvious answer is @entity54 , the @entity55 rapper who 's swiftly gaining fame as the rapper on the @entity59 - assisted " fancy " and @entity61 's " problem			1
" but @entity62 , as she 's known to her fans , has some competition			2
including " fancy , " here are the 10 tracks poised to be the staple song of summer : " fancy , " @entity54 ft. @entity59 the combination of @entity54 's flow with @entity59 's cocky singing on the hook has made " fancy " as irresistible as running through sprinklers on a hot day			1
you think you might be too old for it , but why not ? it 's fun ! cute lyrics , easy to sing along to and upbeat enough to spin at a party , it 's little wonder that this release from @entity86 's " @entity87 " album has been no. 1 on the @entity21 100 since june 7			0
" @entity88 , " @entity89 the @entity91 dj / producer / singer / songwriter has captured exactly what a summer song needs to be with this seasonally appropriate single			1
with wistful lyrics about a warm weather romance and a pulsing beat , @entity89 ' single is an easy favorite			0
" rude , " @entity100 ! @entity101 reggae fusion band @entity100 ! has crooned its way almost to no. 1 with its single " @entity103			2
" the song arrived last fall , but it was n't until beach season that " @entity103 " really took off in the @entity107			1
ridiculously catchy , it comes complete with a heartfelt backstory that makes it applicable to this season of makeups and breakups			0
" @entity116 , " @entity115 ft. @entity114 is @entity115 's ode to the rear end a little silly ? sure			0
but that 's also what makes it perfect for summer			2
with a hypnotic beat and an artist - supplied dance move , " wiggle " is made for carefree nights			0
not even @entity127 could resist " @entity129 " while on vacation			0
" @entity130 , " @entity131 this rock group 's fourth album has been a wellspring of hits , with 2013 's popular " @entity139 " being followed by the light - hearted " @entity130 , " a bouncy track that lives up to its title			1
@entity131 's @entity140 says the making of the single was as breezy as the song itself			2
" problem , " @entity61 ft. @entity54 @entity61 has n't had any problems climbing the charts with this horn - heavy dismissal of an unnecessary love			1
funky and featuring the rapper du jour , @entity54 , " problem " is nipping at the heels of " fancy " to be the top choice of summer 2014			1
" @entity156 , " @entity155 in case you missed our very detailed memo , this is @entity155 's year			2
the @entity163 soul singer has released his debut solo album and has gifted us all with the kind of song that 'll be sung at karaoke for months to come			0
it is n't as danceable as @entity155 's work with @entity170 , the still - hot " latch , " but it is memorable and affecting			0
" @entity174 , " @entity172 and @entity173 since its release last year , @entity172 and @entity173 's " @entity174 " has become the go - to party anthem for anyone wanting to turn up their night			1
it worked just fine when it was cold and darkness fell early , but " @entity174 " demands listening when it 's 8 p.m. , the sun is still bright , and your day 's just getting started			0
" sing , " @entity186 @entity186 used to be known as the guy who sang sad love songs			0
that 's still true , but with his new album , " x , " @entity186 's branched out into more upbeat territory			0
his spring release , " sing , " has a groove produced by @entity27 and a chorus easy enough for the inebriated to howl along to -- usually , that 's more than enough to crown a single the song of the summer			1
" @entity198 , " @entity197 like with " @entity103 , " @entity201 duo @entity197 invoke a beach vibe with their hit " am i wrong			0
" it has a tempo quick enough for dancing but slow enough to encourage pairing off , with just the right amount of sultry for a summer night			0
