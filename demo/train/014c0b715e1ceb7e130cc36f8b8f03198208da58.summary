@entity1 / @entity0 -- @entity3 walks briskly and with a certain purpose			1
carrying three small bags and layered up for the @entity1 night , she weaves through traffic and over crowded pedestrian walkways			1
these are her first steps in a thousand - kilometer trip home to @entity0 province			1
" i feel great , because i am going home , " she says			1
" i only get home once a year or sometimes maybe twice			2
i want to go home to see my parents and children because i miss them			2
" like many migrants , @entity3 came to @entity1 for the money			1
she works two jobs as a maid and her husband gets odd jobs as a foreman			0
together they earn around $ 1,200 a month to support their extended family			2
" i do n't really like @entity1 , " she says			1
her life here is crowded and the work is constant			0
but opportunities to earn in @entity33 have drained from the countryside into the cities			1
and migrants are everywhere in @entity1 's sprawl			1
they clean homes , run fruit stands on wheeled carts , make crispy pancakes on gas fires for the breakfast rush , clean garbage off the streets and clip hedges by hand			2
they help run this city of more than 20 million			1
during the @entity51 , they post handwritten signs on their shops , receive red " @entity54 " envelops stuffed with bonuses , and leave in their millions			0
many @entity1 do n't notice them until they are gone			1
@entity3 joins the throngs milling outside @entity60 , an imposing @entity61 and @entity63 - style landmark			1
everywhere migrants sit on stools and buckets surrounded by their luggage , puffing on cigarettes in the cold			2
" i bet you have n't experienced anything like this before , " says @entity3 as we jam through the bottleneck to board			1
we 're stuck right in the middle of giant swathe of humanity			0
a muffled announcement , a shove forward , a half step backwards , then we shuffle forward all together			0
" do n't push me , " shouts one man as he gets a duffle bag shoved against his head			0
@entity33 has built up an impressive network of high - speed trains			1
but not the 8 p.m @entity86 to @entity87			0
she 's a stately string of carriages in bold blue , red and white , designed for comfort , not for speed			0
even that is compromised during @entity51			0
@entity33 take more than three billion trips during this period , more than 200 million by rail , so just getting a ticket is a bit like winning the lottery			1
tickets online to @entity87 sold out in seconds , says @entity3 , so she bought one to the first stop in @entity103 , hoping the conductors would n't throw them off in this time of goodwill			1
" any pregnant women , young children , or elderly in this carriage , " says the lead conductor , in a sharp navy blue uniform with officer - style cap as the @entity111 clatters out of the station			2
it appears nobody in our carriage could get a ticket beyond @entity103			2
so the conductors register us to be distributed through the train			2
some get sleepers in three - tiered bunks ; others jam in where they can			0
there is a saying in @entity33 : " @entity129 or poor ; get home for the holiday " ( 有钱没钱 ， 回家过年 )			1
it has become a bit of a cliché			0
but for @entity33 , and @entity33 migrants in particular , going home for the @entity51 , or @entity138 , festival is near mandatory and often the only time of the year they can be with their families			1
" i really do miss my children , " says @entity3			1
" it 's not like we are separated by a month or two , it 's for a whole year			0
that is a long time and there is such a huge distance between us			2
" @entity3 's family mirrors changes in @entity33			1
her father 's generation worked the fields near their village , but pollution and urbanization made farming untenable			0
@entity3 missed out on an education , so she works doggedly to support the whole family			1
her daughter works at an appliance factory			0
but her son is in university studying physics			2
he is their big hope			0
" his tuition costs thousands and we have to pay , " says @entity3			1
" but i am full of hope he will graduate and find a good job with a steady income and he will contribute to the family			2
everything we do is for our children and our family			2
" migrant families are full of these sorts of burdens and dreams			1
so , for many , ten hours in a crowded train is no real hardship at all			2
others on the train , like mr. fan , who runs a breakfast stand in @entity1 , are also happy to suffer the cramped conditions			1
" we go home once a year to see my kids and my parents			0
this travel is nothing to me			0
i am totally content , " he says			0
around him people sleep on the carriage floor , others pack in three abreast in standing room			0
they eat , try to sleep and play @entity198 , a popular @entity33 card game			1
" only eight minutes to go , " says @entity3 in the pre-dawn gloom as we approach @entity87			1
" i am feeling great , but i am sure you are tired			0
" soon there will be the reunion , the meals , the fireworks			0
gossiping with friends and seeing family			0
but @entity3 has only one thought			1
" every year when i get near my home i feel so happy			0
but going back is so hard			0
i feel so sad then that every time i cry			0
" @entity2 's @entity212 contributed to this report .			0

a migrant worker in @entity33 travels home to be with her family for the @entity218
@entity3 and other migrants like her help to run @entity1 , a city of more than 20 million
@entity225 is often the only time these workers can see their families
in a cramped train carriage , @entity3 tells of her hopes for her son , and the *joy* of going home
