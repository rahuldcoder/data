@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's speech to an @entity1 tea party rally on saturday will come on the three - year anniversary of her memorable address to the @entity9 in 2008 , when she became @entity11 vice presidential nominee and an instant conservative darling			1
much has changed since then			0
after the @entity11 ticket went down in defeat , @entity4 returned to @entity15 and shocked @entity11 by leaving the governor 's mansion the following summer			1
after a period in the wilderness ( at times literally ) , she re-emerged and transformed herself into a curious amalgam of tea party firebrand , global celebrity , @entity26 prognosticator , reality television star and , of course , potential presidential contender			1
now in the final stages of deciding on whether to embark on that @entity32 bid , @entity4 plans to use her @entity1 speech to revisit the themes of that convention address that made her a star			1
@entity4 will also deliver a sharp indictment of president @entity40 and accuse him on failing to change the way @entity42 works , a source familiar with the speech said			1
" what she is going to address in this speech is the frustration that members of the tea party movement and ordinary americans feel when they send politicians to @entity42 and nothing gets changed , " the source said			1
" there is a frustration that the status quo is always the status quo			0
" the source said @entity4 is attempting to burnish her image as an outsider and a reformer , reminding the audience of her record in @entity15 and specifically highlighting her battles against what she called the state 's corrupt @entity9 political class that was in cahoots with the oil and gas industry			1
@entity4 plans to unleash a furious criticism of " crony capitalism " and attack the " permanent political class " in both parties : thinly veiled criticisms of @entity73 gov. @entity72 , who has surged to the top of most polls for the @entity9 presidential nomination			2
political opponents have long accused @entity72 , who has held some form of elected office since 1985 , of rewarding his allies and campaign donors with plum government posts and contracts			0
though she has no plans to mention @entity72 or any other @entity9 presidential hopeful by name , @entity4 will implicitly contrast herself against the current crop of @entity11 candidates and further define her brand in case she does decide to run			1
@entity4 , who has said she plans to make a decision about the race by late september , will not announce a presidential bid saturday			2
the speech almost did n't happen			0
@entity4 had initially accepted an invitation to speak at the @entity97 event in @entity98 , which generated national buzz when it was announced last month			2
@entity4 supporters from across the country are traveling to the state by plane and bus for the speech , and the governor is likely to speak to them in @entity0 on friday evening at a meet - up organized by the online hub @entity109			1
but members of @entity4 's staff indicated this week that her appearance at saturday 's rally was being put on hold because of " planning issues " and concerns that the group behind the event , @entity117 of @entity118 , was being " dishonest " about the speaking program			0
a @entity4 adviser said wednesday that event organizers had been sending them mixed messages about the event , including the question of whether @entity126 , whom @entity4 endorsed in her run for the @entity128 in @entity129 in 2010 , would participate			0
@entity126 was removed from the speaking program at the request of the @entity4 team , one of the rally 's organizers , @entity136 , told the @entity137			0
the @entity4 source said @entity126 's representatives had misled the @entity117 group about the extent of the governor 's relationship with @entity126			2
@entity126 's representatives told event organizers that she would be in @entity1 on the date of the rally and would like to come by and " say hi " to @entity4 , the source said			0
@entity126 was then added to the speaking agenda			0
the source said @entity126 aides lied to organizers and said @entity4 had been communicating via text message with @entity126 about the rally			0
" the governor has n't spoken to her in a year , " the @entity4 source said of @entity126 .			2
