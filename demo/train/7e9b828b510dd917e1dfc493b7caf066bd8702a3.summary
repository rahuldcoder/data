after calling a teammate " gay " for getting his teeth whitened			0
the 19 - year - old reacted to a photo that colleague @entity8 had posted on social networking site @entity10 that showed him having treatment on his teeth			1
he posted : " what f * * * is he doing ? this guy is gay ... he does everything except play football			0
" @entity1 later deleted the tweet and has subsequently apologized			2
@entity8 defended his teammate after news of the fine emerged , saying it was just " banter "			1
" ' is amazing how fa can fine my friend @ suso30fernandez for a banter thing			2
was just a joke ! " @entity8 posted on his own @entity10 site			1
@entity1 , who has made 13 appearances for @entity2 this season , has also been warned about his future conduct by the @entity3			1
a statement on their website read : " following an @entity35 hearing @entity2 's @entity1 ( @entity1 ) has been fined Â £ 10,000 and warned as to his future conduct for a comment posted on @entity10			1
" the charge , which the player admitted and requested a paper hearing , was that he acted in a way which was improper and / or brought the game into disrepute in that the comment was posted on his @entity10 account and included a reference to a person / s sexual orientation and / or disability			1
" the sanctions meted out to @entity1 were welcomed by the @entity51 , but their chair @entity52 said in a statement he thought the fine should go towards the fight against discrimination			2
" we hope that it will continue to be a warning to people in the game that homophobic comments are not an acceptable form of banter and that people should take greater care when using social media			0
" however , in a time where resources to fight discrimination in football are limited , we would like to see the monies received by the @entity3 in fines reinvested in the fight against homophobia			0
