a patient being treated at a @entity3 hospital is the first person diagnosed with @entity4 in the @entity5 , health officials announced tuesday			1
the unidentified man left @entity7 on september 19 and arrived in the @entity5 on september 20 , said dr. @entity8 , director of the @entity9			1
at that time , the individual did not have symptoms			0
" but four or five days later , " he began to exhibit them , @entity8 said			2
the individual was hospitalized and isolated sunday at @entity14			2
citing privacy concerns , health officials declined to release any details about how the patient contracted the virus or how he was being treated			2
" i can say he is ill. he is under intensive care , " dr. @entity20 of the hospital told reporters			2
@entity8 declined to answer whether the patient is a @entity5 citizen			1
he also declined to say , clearly , whether the patient is a man , although he referred to the person as " he " on multiple occasions			2
" the patient was visiting family members and staying with family members who live in this country , " he said at a news conference			2
however , the city of @entity3 in a news release said the patient " moved to @entity3 from @entity7 a week ago			1
" the patient is believed to have had a handful of contacts with people after showing symptoms of the virus , and before being isolated , @entity8 said			1
a @entity9 team was en route to @entity40 to help investigate those contacts , and @entity40 gov. @entity41 will be in @entity3 on wednesday to hold a news conference			1
crew members who transported the patient to the hospital have been isolated , the chief of staff for @entity3 mayor @entity44 told @entity48			1
none have shown symptoms of the disease so far			0
the ambulance that carried the patient - ambulance # 37 --- was in use for two days after the transport but was adequately decontaminated , said @entity3 city spokeswoman @entity56			1
" i do want to stress that the paramedics followed national standards , as they do after each transport , in decontaminating the ambulance , " she said			2
" the @entity62 health department has confirmed that paramedics did follow proper guidelines to avoid contaminating additional patients			0
" @entity8 , too , sought to play down the risk to public health			0
there are currently no other suspected cases of @entity4 in @entity40			0
" it 's a severe disease , which has a high - case fatality rate , even with the best of care , but there are core , tried and true public health interventions that stop it , " @entity8 said			0
" the bottom line here is that i have no doubt that we will control this importation or this case of @entity4 so that it does not spread widely in this country , " he said			0
according to the @entity9 , @entity4 causes viral hemorrhagic fever , which can affect multiple organ systems in the body and is often accompanied by bleeding			1
early symptoms include sudden onset of fever , weakness , muscle pain , headaches and a sore throat , each of which can be easily mistaken early on for other ailments like malaria , typhoid fever and meningitis			0
@entity4 is spread by direct contact with someone sick with the virus			0
that means people on the patient 's flight are not thought to be at risk , as he did not begin to show symptoms until several days after arriving in the @entity5 , @entity8 said			1
he spoke about what 's being done at airports to help stop the spread of the disease			0
" one of the things that @entity9 has done in @entity7 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 , is to work with the airports ' authority so 100 % of the individuals getting on planes are screened for fever , " the director said			1
" and if they have a fever , they are pulled out of the line , assessed for @entity4 and do n't fly unless @entity4 is ruled out			0
" he added , however : " as long as there continue to be cases in @entity132 , the reality is that patients travel , individuals travel , and , as appears to have happened in this case , individuals may travel before they have any symptoms			0
" how the virus spreads ebola virus : 9 things to know about the killer disease a number of other @entity5 have been diagnosed with the disease in @entity132 and then brought to the @entity5 for treatment			1
the @entity4 outbreak has been centered in the @entity132 countries of @entity118 , @entity117 and @entity7 , though there have been concerns about international air travel and other factors -- including the fact the symptoms might not appear until two to 21 days after one is infected -- may contribute to its spread			1
more than 3,000 people in @entity132 have died after being infected with @entity4 , according to a @entity157 report from last week			0
the same report stated that there had been 6,553 cases of the virus overall , though the number is suspected to be much higher , given difficulties in tracking and reporting the disease			0
the reason @entity4 is n't being stopped " i have no doubt that we 'll stop this in its tracks in the @entity5 but i also have no doubt that as long as the outbreak continues in @entity132 , we need to be on our guard , " said @entity8 .			1

ambulance that transported patient was in service for two more days
crew that transported the patient to the hospital has been isolated
" i have no doubt that we 'll stop this in its tracks in the @entity5 , " @entity9 director says
