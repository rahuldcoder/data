frogggsss in spaaaccceee ! or frog , at least			1
and maybe not in space , but for certain a wild ride			0
look closely at the photo above and you 'll see the little guy streaking skyward alongside a 90 - foot - tall rocket carrying a moon mission from the @entity9 at @entity11 's @entity10 in @entity12 on friday			1
another piece of science fiction , you 're thinking			0
but @entity11 confirms the photo , taken by a remote camera during friday 's launch of the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , is not some trick			1
" the photo team confirms the frog is real and was captured in a single frame by one of the remote cameras used to photograph the launch , " it says on its website			1
the photo was first posted online wednesday by @entity29			1
it 's been hopping around the internet since			0
and prompting some super puns we have to share			0
" this frog gives new meaning to " flying leap , " ( or giant leap )			2
" @entity29 in that original post			0
" from lily pad to launch pad			2
" an unlucky frog took a giant leap for mankind			2
" @entity45 " did it croak ? " @entity47 and not to be outdone , a source told @entity49 the creature 's last words were : " @entity52 , orrrbit			0
" " the condition of the frog , however , is uncertain , " @entity11 says on its website , but these kind of things tend not to end well for amphibians			1
so how did it get there in the first place ? " the launchpad at the @entity63 has a ' pool ' for the high - volume water deluge system that activates during launches to protect the pad from damage and for noise suppression , and likely there was a ( formerly ) damp , cool place that was a nice spot for a frog to hang out , " @entity29 reported			1
while the frog 's short trip to the final frontier may be over , @entity19 's continues			2
it is expected to reach lunar orbit on october 6 and then commence gathering " detailed information about the lunar atmosphere , conditions near the surface and environmental influences on lunar dust , " @entity11 said			1
" a thorough understanding of these characteristics will address long - standing unknowns , and help scientists understand other planetary bodies as well			0
" follow the @entity19 mission			0
