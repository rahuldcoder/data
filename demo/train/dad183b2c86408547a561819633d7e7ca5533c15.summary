airports are no place to sleep , as any weary traveler who has tried to grab a few minutes shuteye during a layover can attest			1
but that may be changing , thanks to a new breed of short - stay , pay - by - the - hour micro-hotels popping up in airport terminals around the world			1
based loosely on the concept of the @entity16 " capsule hotel , " these cabins and boxes allow sleepy travelers to seal themselves off from the surrounding commotion for a 30 - minute power nap or a solid night 's sleep without having to leave the terminal for a hotel			1
some even contain toilets and showers			0
in recent years , versions of the concept have emerged from @entity27 to @entity28 and from @entity29 to @entity30 , with other destinations likely to follow this year			1
and they are spreading beyond the airport terminal			1
@entity34 , which operates short - stay " cabins " in airports in @entity27 and @entity37 , has also opened a hotel in @entity39 based on a similar concept , while @entity41 , which has a demonstration model in @entity28 's @entity43 , will open 60 of its units in downtown @entity28 in a matter of weeks			1
here are three of the best micro-hotels proving that size is n't everything			0
@entity34 : @entity34 has operated its pod hotels in @entity27 's @entity51 and @entity52 airports since 2007 , and in @entity37 's @entity37 since 2008			1
described by the company as being " inspired by first - class airline cabins , " and by one user review as " a cross between a train compartment and a space ship , " these small units pack in single or double beds , entertainment systems , a work desk and an en suite bathroom into between 7 to 10 square meters			1
the cabins -- 32 at @entity51 , 46 at @entity52 and 57 at @entity37 -- cost about £ 25 ( $ 39 ) for four hours , or about £ 60 ( $ 93 ) overnight			1
@entity34 also operates a hotel based on a similar concept in @entity67 , with 669 slightly larger rooms			2
@entity34 marketing director @entity69 said the airport cabins had very high occupancy rates , and the company planned to roll out its operations in other airports soon			1

six cabins are currently in operation , with plans to add more in coming months			2
they contain a bed , desk , air conditioning , internet access and a tv			0
the minimum charge for their use is € 30 ( $ 38 ) , which buys two hours between 6am and 10pm , or three hours outside those times			0
the company says it is moving to other airports shortly			2
@entity41 : the cozy , 4 - square - meter @entity41 contains a maximum of three bunk beds , bedside tables , electrical outlets , and reading lamps and can be equipped with a television and alarm clock			0
a model @entity105 was installed in the @entity108 terminal of @entity28 's @entity43 in august , and will be put into commercial use in coming weeks when 60 are installed for use in downtown @entity28			1
the @entity41 's designers envisage the units will also be used in train stations , shopping malls and exhibition centers			0
they can be booked for as little as 30 minutes ; @entity41 recommends a usage charge of @entity117 $ 15 an hour			2

@entity128 also installed 13 suites in 2011			2
standard features include a daybed sofa and an @entity133 television			0
a desk , phone , office chair and @entity138 internet connection ensures each suite can also act as a makeshift office space			0
a minimum one - hour stay costs $ 30 , while every 15 minutes thereafter is charged at a rate of $ 7.50			2
@entity143 : situated in terminal one of @entity146 , @entity144 offers a compact and soundproof room complete with bed , touchscreen tv and internet access			0
there are currently 10 units in operation and a one - hour stay costs as little as $ 16			0
all @entity155 are connected to the airport 's flight information system to ensure that passengers do not miss their flights .			0
