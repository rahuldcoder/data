-- ever since the @entity3 more than 50 years ago , athletes on the communist island have been able to garner gold medals and glory , but not big paychecks			1
in a shift , the @entity8 government says it will allow its athletes to play professionally abroad , ostensibly to shore up the competitiveness of its national teams			1
but it can not be overlooked that lucrative contracts for @entity8 athletes abroad would benefit the state through taxation			1
whether the new policy , announced through state media on friday , will open a floodgate of talented @entity8 athletes to the @entity23 will have to be seen			1
several obstacles stand to limit how much freedom athletes will actually have			0
the new policy will be implemented in the coming months , the state - run @entity27 newspaper reported			0
it follows an earlier opening by the @entity8 government to let its boxers compete in the @entity33 , a semipro league			2
@entity35 passions stir in @entity8 limits faced by athletes until now , defection has been the common path for @entity8 athletes who want to compete abroad			1
@entity42 ' star @entity41 , for instance , defected from @entity8 in 2012 and signed a seven - year , $ 42 million contract			2
there are others in @entity8 sports history who have left millions on the table to remain loyal and compete for their government			2
the late boxer @entity49 , a three - time olympic gold medal winner , passed up a rich offer to fight @entity51			0
but @entity49 did not appear to have any regrets about his decision to turn down a big payday by staying amateur			0
" what is $ 1 million compared to the love of 8 million @entity8 ? " he famously declared			2
top @entity8 athletes can make a few hundred dollars a month on the island			1
they stand to make much more with the coming changes			0
@entity8 travel reform a home run for baseball star who defected new policy the opening of opportunities to make money abroad seems like a recognition of the lucrative market for athletes , but @entity27 explained it as an affirmation of @entity73 's slogan : " from each according to his ability , to each according to his need			1
" whatever foreign pro-sports contracts athletes may sign , they will still be required to be in @entity8 for the key national team competitions , according to @entity27			1
@entity8 has traditionally produced strong boxers and baseball players , and even though this policy will open doors to competing anywhere abroad , the @entity23 stands to be the biggest attraction			1
there is no guarantee , however , that the @entity8 players who take advantage of this policy will see that sought - after @entity23 contract			2
the first problem is the @entity23 embargo on @entity8 , a policy that isolates @entity8 economically and financially			2
the @entity8 government envisions its athletes paying taxes on money earned anywhere abroad , but if that money is made in the @entity23 , sending it to the communist nation would violate a longstanding economic embargo , a @entity23 official familiar with its enforcement told @entity0			1
in practice , @entity8 athletes are more likely to end up in leagues in countries other than the @entity23			1
@entity113 is king in @entity8 , and @entity113 would be a coveted destination for many @entity8 athletes			1
the league is aware of reports about the new @entity8 policy , but said in a statement that " given that we do not have any details of this change in policy , it would be premature for us to speculate what effect it may have			0
" @entity113 " and its clubs have and will continue to act in accordance with the laws and policies of the @entity131 , " the statement said			0
another hurdle for athletes is the migration reform that went into effect in @entity8 this year that still requires athletes to seek government approval to travel abroad			1
with this restriction in place , the government maintains control over which athletes it trusts to seek contracts abroad			0
still , initial reaction was positive			0
" if that happened , it 's good for the people of @entity8 , " @entity146 of the @entity148 team @entity147 told the @entity149			0
@entity146 defected from @entity8 in 2007			0
" they can play anywhere and show they have good ( athletes ) , " @entity146 told the @entity149			0
" i 'm very happy for them that they 're giving them opportunities to play in other countries and to be professionals in other leagues			0
