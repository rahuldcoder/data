-- " @entity1 has the honor of announcing that the 23rd @entity3 in 2018 are awarded to the city of @entity5			1
" the date was july 6 , 2011			0
the speaker was @entity1 ( @entity9 ) president @entity8			0
it might have been third time lucky for the @entity12 city , having lost narrowly to @entity13 in 2010 and @entity14 in 2014 , but the name of @entity5 probably had many of us reaching for an atlas			1
important point : it should not be confused with @entity20 , the @entity21 capital			2
' @entity12 's @entity22 ' located approximately 113 miles ( 182 kilometers ) southeast of @entity26 , in the spectacular southern part of @entity25 , @entity5 sits at 700 meters above sea level in one of the most rugged , mountainous regions of the country , an area often referred to as " @entity12 's @entity22			1
" it seems like a reasonable choice			0
@entity12 also has previous @entity34 form -- though admittedly of the summer variety ( @entity26 1988 )			1
it 's also arguably a less puzzling choice than @entity14 , a crumbling @entity37 - era beach resort on the @entity39 coast -- ironically one of the few places in @entity41 where snow is actually scarce			1
the looming @entity43 nearby were not exactly known for snow sports either , so virtually everything -- from competition venues to road and rail links -- had to be built from scratch			2
15 top @entity14 moments yet the @entity14 games went reasonably well -- from a sporting perspective at least			2
the action was at times exhilarating , visitors overcame hotel horror stories , and the security threat from extremists never materialized			0
yet critics will point to the $ 50 billion price tag -- the largest ever for a summer or winter @entity3 -- and protests against @entity41 's human rights record and its stance on gay rights			2
the sight of the @entity68 punk group being attacked with whips and teargas by @entity72 militia making headlines across the world would have made president @entity76 wince			0
' flat - pack ' games the 24th @entity3 promises to be much less controversial			2
it also wo n't have @entity14 's " flat - pack " construction feel as @entity5 already boasts established infrastructure , with six major ski resorts , including @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 , making it one of the country 's top skiing and snowboarding destinations			1
@entity5 was also the site of @entity12 's first official ski resort in 1975			1
@entity41 's @entity14 gold rush - paradise lost , or found ? seven of the 13 competition venues required by the @entity9 , including those for cross-country skiing , ski jumping and biathlon , are already in place , while snow is less likely to be concern as the region typically experiences heavy winter snowfall -- something that organizers in @entity14 and @entity13 could not be as confident about			1
unseasonably mild temperatures bedeviled the @entity107 host city in 2010 , disrupting many of the ski events			0
fearing similar problems , organizers at @entity14 stockpiled huge amounts of snow from the previous season			2
@entity34 legacy yet the @entity12 government wo n't be sitting on their hands either , as it seeks to turn this area into a world - class winter sports destination well beyond 2018			1
it currently takes more than three hours by road from @entity26 to reach @entity5 -- a journey that will shorten to just 50 minutes when a new high - speed rail network opens in 2017			1
last month , the @entity12 government unveiled a comprehensive plan to develop the city and the surrounding areas in @entity25			1
designating the region of some 27.4 square kilometers as a special district , the government announced plans to invest 3.3 trillion won ( us $ 3.1 billion ) by 2032 to turn it into " a mecca of winter sports and a major tourist destination , " according to the prime minister 's office			1
most of this investment will be made by 2018 to host a successful @entity3 , it added			0
stressing the importance of preventing any waste of resources after hosting international events , prime minister @entity139 told the @entity145 news agency : " ( the plan ) should be aimed at a continued regional development after a successful hosting of the @entity149			0
" @entity151 's 2018 destiny was never really in doubt , as it won the right to become the first @entity155 city outside @entity156 to host the @entity3			0
it comfortably beat off the challenge of two other bid cities : @entity160 in @entity161 , and @entity162 in @entity163			0
had it won , @entity160 would have been the first city to host both the @entity164 and @entity3			0
the city attracted the @entity166 in 1972			0
@entity162 , meanwhile , met with many difficulties in its bid for the 2018 nomination , including a small budget and change in leadership on the bid committee .			0

third time lucky for @entity5 , which lost out to @entity13 in 2010 and @entity14 in 2014
located southeast of @entity26 in an area known as " @entity12 's @entity22 "
many of the required venues already in place as @entity5 is an established destination
government plans to invest heavily in region , including high - speed rail link with capital
