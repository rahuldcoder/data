wearing a sparkling engagement ring , @entity0 regularly attended pretrial hearings for her fiancé , @entity4			1
he was often seen mouthing " i love you , " to her			0
but as testimony gets underway , will @entity0 ' words help or hurt her fiancé if she takes the stand ? @entity0 is on the prosecution 's witness list			1
" normally , a fiancée is not going to testify adversely against her true love , " said @entity1 legal analyst @entity13 , a former @entity14 homicide prosecutor			2
but there is no privilege in @entity19 allowing engaged couples to avoid testifying against one another			0
@entity4 , the @entity22 tight end who once had a $ 40 million contract , has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of @entity25			1
he has also pleaded not guilty to other weapons charges			1
his co-defendants , @entity28 and @entity29 , have also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately			1
what could be at stake for @entity0 ? prosecutors say @entity4 's high school sweetheart lied to a grand jury several times about the presence of guns in their @entity39 home , among other issues			1
she faces possible jail time if found guilty of perjury charges			1
she has pleaded not guilty			1
@entity0 and @entity4 are the parents of a daughter who was just a year old when her father was arrested on june 26 , 2013			2
@entity47 ' sister @entity46 was dating @entity25 , 27 , who was shot seven times , according to a medical examiner			2
who 's who in @entity4 case in early january , @entity0 met with @entity52 , @entity19 , prosecutors in what court documents call an immunity meeting , but the results of that meeting are secret even from the @entity4 defense team			1
what could @entity47 say that might implicate her fiancé in @entity25 's death ? for one thing , on the day after @entity25 's killing , prosecutors say she got a coded text message from @entity4			1
search warrants say @entity4 asked his fiancée to get something out of their basement			1
" go ... in back of the screen in movie room when u ( sic ) get home an ( sic ) there is a box ... jus ( sic ) in case u were looking for it ! ! ! member ( sic ) how you ruined the big tv ... @entity86 bout that lol wink wink love u ttyl ...			0
@entity88 " @entity89 is shorthand for " talk to you later			0
" the evidence against @entity4 : what 's in , what 's out a home surveillance video shows @entity0 leaving the house about an hour later carrying something " rigid " she described as a box , court documents state			1
she placed it inside a garbage bag , covered it with children 's clothing , and carried the bag to a car and drove away , prosecutors say			0
@entity0 borrowed her sister 's car , something her sister told investigators she had never done before			0
when @entity0 returned home , she is seen on the same security system but without the " rigid " item			0
@entity0 told a grand jury she threw the item in a dumpster but could n't remember where , according to prosecutors			0
prosecutors suspect the murder weapon was inside			0
it has not been found			0
@entity4 's lawyers have argued there 's no way of knowing what was in the box			1
" i mean , who knows ? " @entity4 co-counsel @entity127 told the court in 2014			2
" it could be drugs , it could be something that was connected to this crime that he knew about , that he was covering up for somebody else after the fact			0
there are all kinds of possibilities			0
" @entity4 's defense team has filed a motion demanding to know what promises prosecutors may have made to @entity0 in the so - called immunity meeting			1
if she made a deal for a lesser charge or immunity , the jury will have to take it into account			0
" the jury is going to look at that and say , ' you know something ? he must be guilty if even his fiancée would say that , ' " said @entity13			2
" or the defense would convince them that she 's made such a sweet deal with the prosecution that she 's decided to lie to implicate her lover , " he added			2
@entity13 suggested that if @entity0 is put on the stand as a prosecution witness and repeats her grand jury testimony that she threw out the item without knowing what was inside and ca n't remember where she disposed of it , she could put herself in greater legal jeopardy			2
that 's because , @entity13 said , prosecutors could later contend at a perjury trial that she repeated an alleged lie under oath			1
" it 's going to increase her guilt if the prosecutor pursues perjury charges , " @entity13 said			1
on the other hand , if @entity0 decides to testify without immunity , takes the @entity182 against self - incrimination and gives no substantive testimony , @entity13 said the defense may argue ahead of time that her testimony would be prejudicial to @entity4 and not be allowed			2
while some jurors may think prosecutors should not " force " a loved one to testify , @entity13 said it may be unavoidable if prosecutors are convinced it 's necessary to help prove their case			0
" this is not just harassing a loved one , this is putting somebody on the witness stand who has information for the jury , " @entity13 added			0
@entity0 ' lawyer has declined comment			0
her client may be in a tough spot either way , if she is in a struggle over family loyalty versus the chance of losing her freedom .			0
