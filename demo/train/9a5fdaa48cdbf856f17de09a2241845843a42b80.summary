-- this year , on the 15th season of @entity4 's weight - loss show " @entity5 , " @entity1 did exactly what the show producers , the celebrity trainers and the audience asked her to : she lost the most weight			1
she lost so much weight , in fact , that many have decided she is now unhealthily thin			1
@entity14 dropped at her final weigh - in			2
at 5 - foot - 5 and 105 pounds , her body mass index is below what the @entity18 considers healthy			1
i wo n't speculate on her health			1
that 's for a doctor to determine , and hopefully she 's regularly seeing one			2
she says she 's " never felt this great			2
" i think i know exactly how @entity1 is feeling right now			2
in a word : intoxicated			2
and as i also know from experience , that intoxication can be deadly dangerous			2
' @entity5 ' winner : too thin ? growing up as a student of classical ballet , i floated in and out of all kinds of unhealthy eating disorders			1
i experimented with bulimia , starvation , laxatives and diet pills			2
dancers knew plenty of terrible tricks			2
we 'd eat carrots and use the bright orange to mark when to stop throwing up before all the nutrients and energy we needed to dance were expended			2
we ate tissue paper to feel full			2
we were caffeine addicts -- some even snorted it			2
many smoked cigarettes and a few did drugs			0
our unhealthy habits at @entity52 even led to a " @entity56 " investigation in 1997 , when a friend and fellow dancer died suddenly at 22			0
not only did all of this make for very bad habits , but as an impressionable , insecure and developmentally immature adolescent girl , body issues were ingrained at the worst possible time , and when i was least equipped to deal with them			1
my teen years were spent , irrationally , consumed with being too fat			0
when i finally left ballet , i found relief in the normalcy of college			0
that relief turned to excitement when i found friends -- and boyfriends -- who thought i was pretty great , even without starving myself			0
and that excitement turned to empowerment when i found a career in writing that turned me on and did n't care what i looked like			1
i left body issues behind			1
i knew who i was			0
ironically , all that self - esteem spurred unexpected weight loss			1
i suddenly dropped 10 , 15 , 20 pounds without trying			0
i was eating healthily , working out occasionally , and enjoying my 20s			1
i 'd never been happier			0
the compliments , the attention , the looks on friends ' faces who had n't seen me in a few months -- it was all euphoric			1
watching the numbers on the scale tick backward , clothing sizes drop -- i 'd chased that feeling for so long as a teenager , and it was finally happening			0
and as the compliments turned to concern i grew even more determined to hold on to that euphoria , to keep the weight off and maybe drop a few more pounds			1
if someone did n't mention my weight loss , i was despondent			1
what was once occasional exercise became compulsive working out			0
eating healthy turned into not eating			1
instead of going out with friends i preferred to stay in , so i could not eat in private			0
i had n't been trying to lose weight , did n't even think i needed to			1
but when it happened inadvertently the euphoria was so addicting , i did n't want it to stop			1
the good news is , older , wiser and having beat body issues before , i knew i did n't want to get sucked back in to a dark and compulsive life controlled completely by my weight			1
i made a decision to never return to those addictions , no matter how good they felt			0
i stopped the feverish workouts			0
i returned to normal eating			1
i saw my friends again			0
years later , i make daily decisions to strike a balance between being healthy and being obsessive			0
and if the choice is between being 10 pounds overweight and 10 pounds underweight , i choose over			0
it has n't been easy			1
i have a job on television now and the pressure to look good and stay thin is immense			1
i simply do n't pay attention to it			1
i was recently a bride , and unlike many women preparing to walk down the aisle , i refused to embark on some crazy crash diet to look my thinnest in a corset , though the temptation was there			0
and i am sure that when i have children , i 'll worry about losing baby weight like every other new mother does			1
but i will do all i can to obsess over my baby and not those stubborn remaining pounds			0
i 'll bet that @entity1 can relate to much of my story			0
i bet that when she was at her heaviest she was unhappy , and maybe even depressed			0
i bet she never thought she could look the way she wanted			0
i bet she fantasized about what it would be like to be thin			1
and now i bet she is intoxicated by the attention she 's gotten for losing so much weight , intoxicated by the rush of losing another pound , by the boost in energy she has from working out			1
and i bet she has vowed to herself never to gain the weight back , never to return to the previous her			2
i just hope that in addition to weight loss and workout techniques , the trainers and doctors on the show have equipped her to deal with the addictive behaviors that can result from successfully getting in shape			2
i hope they 've warned her about a mental anguish that can be just as dark as the one she felt as a heavier woman , and maybe even more dangerous			0
and i hope they 've told her that despite the thrill of losing the most weight , she will not become a " loser " if she gains some back			1
i 'm proud of @entity1 for getting healthy			0
and i hope she loves who she is			0
but the next year will be an important and potentially dangerous one for her , with addictive behaviors lurking around every corner			0
i just hope she 's strong enough to avoid them			0
