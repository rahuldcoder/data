it 's a potential game changer in the fight against @entity2 , and doctors say it happened almost by accident			1
a baby with the virus that causes @entity8 was given high doses of three antiretroviral drugs within 30 hours of her birth			2
doctors knew the mother was @entity2 positive and administered the drugs in hopes of controlling the virus			1
two years later , there is no evidence of @entity2 in the child 's blood			1
the @entity23 girl is the first child to be " functionally cured " of @entity2 , researchers announced sunday			1
they said they believe early intervention with the antiretroviral drugs was key to the outcome			2
a " functional cure " is when the presence of the virus is so small , lifelong treatment is not necessary and standard clinical tests can not detect the virus in the blood			0
timeline : @entity8 moments to remember the finding was announced at the 2013 @entity37 in @entity38			0
the unidentified girl was born @entity2 positive to a mother who received no prenatal care and was not diagnosed as @entity2 positive herself until just before delivery			1
" we did n't have the opportunity to treat the mom during the pregnancy as we would like to be able do to prevent transmission to the baby , " said dr. @entity44 , a pediatric @entity2 specialist at the @entity45			1
@entity44 told @entity52 the timing of intervention -- before the baby 's hiv diagnosis -- may deserve " more emphasis than the particular drugs or number of drugs used			1
" " we are hoping that future studies will show that very early institution of effective therapy will result in this same outcome consistently , " she said on the eve of the @entity38 conference			0
high - risk exposure dr. @entity68 , an immunologist at the @entity69 who worked closely with @entity44 , called the developments fascinating , including the fact that the toddler was found to have no virus in her blood even after her mother stopped giving her treatment for eight to 10 months			0
" this is the very first case in which we 've conclusively been able to document that the baby was infected and then after a period of treatment has been able to go off treatment without viral rebound , " @entity68 told @entity52			0
once it was determined the @entity23 mother was @entity2 positive , gay immediately began giving the infant antiretroviral drugs upon the baby 's delivery in an attempt to control hiv infection			1

" and because it was a high - risk exposure , i decided to use three drugs rather than one			2
" within a couple of days , @entity44 confirmed the child was @entity2 positive			1
she said the baby had probably been infected in the womb			0
the child remained on antiretroviral drugs for about 15 months			2
her mother then stopped administering the drug for some reason , and care was resumed after health officials intervened , @entity44 said			0
researchers have long known that treating hiv - positive mothers early on is important , because they pass antibodies on to their babies			1
" one hundred percent of ( hiv - positive ) moms will pass those antibodies , but in the absence of treatment , only 30 % of moms will transmit the actual virus , " @entity68 told @entity52			2
@entity2 - positive mothers given appropriate treatment pass the virus on in less than 2 % of cases , @entity68 said			1
" so all babies are born antibody positive , but only a fraction of babies born to hiv - positive women will actually get the virus , and that fraction depends on whether the mom and baby are getting antiviral prophylaxis ( preventative treatment ) or not , " @entity68 said			1
newborns are considered high - risk if their mothers ' hiv infections are not under control or if they are found to be @entity2 positive when they 're close to delivering			1
moving quickly to suppress the virus usually , these infants would get antiviral drugs at preventative doses for six weeks to prevent infection , then start therapy if @entity2 is diagnosed			1
investigators said the @entity23 case may change that practice because it highlights the potential for cure with early standard antiretroviral therapy , or art. @entity155 is a combination of at least three drugs used to suppress the virus and stop the progression of the disease			2
but they do not kill the virus			0
tests showed the virus in the @entity23 baby 's blood continued to decrease and reached undetectable levels within 29 days of the initial treatment			0
dr. @entity169 , a virologist with @entity170 , was lead author on the report presented at the conference			0
the early treatment likely led to the infant 's cure , she said			0
' like pulling teeth ' to get doctors to test for @entity2 " prompt antiviral therapy in newborns that begins within days of exposure may help infants clear the virus and achieve long - term remission without lifelong treatment by preventing such viral hideouts from forming in the first place , " @entity169 said			1
@entity169 and @entity187 are part of a group of researchers working to explore and document possible pediatric @entity2 cure cases			1
the group was funded by a grant from @entity194 , and the @entity195			0
dr. @entity196 , @entity194 vice president and director of research , said it is " imperative that we learn more about a newborn 's immune system , how it differs from an adults and what factors made it possible for the child to be cured			2
" dr. @entity207 , director of the @entity208 at the @entity195 , said he is enthusiastic about the findings			0
" the best way to either eliminate the virus or allow the immune system to suppress residual virus is to treat someone as early as possible after infection so as not to allow a substantial reservoir of the virus to take hold , " @entity207 told @entity52			2
" at the same time , you prevent the immune system from being severely damaged by the continual replication of ( the ) virus for an extended period of time , " he said			0
" the situation with a child born of an infected mother where most of the infections are transmitted to the newborn at or around the time of delivery provides an excellent opportunity to cure an infected baby , and this approach deserves further study			2
" ' @entity237 patient ' researchers say the only other documented case of an @entity2 cure is that of @entity241 , known as the " @entity237 patient			1
" in 2007 , @entity241 , an @entity2 - positive @entity243 living in @entity244 , was battling both leukemia and @entity2 when he underwent a bone marrow transplant that cured not only his cancer but his @entity2			1
in an interview last year , @entity241 told dr. @entity249 , @entity52 's chief medical correspondent , he was still @entity2 - free			1
" i 've been tested everywhere possible , " said @entity241 , who now lives in @entity250			0
" my blood 's been tested by many , many agencies			0
i 've had two colonoscopies to test to see if they could find @entity2 in my colon , and they have n't been able to find any			1
" but @entity241 's case is rare			0
and the procedure , which is extremely dangerous , wo n't work in most patients because the bone marrow he received had a special genetic mutation that made the stem cells in it naturally resistant to the virus			0
researchers tell @entity52 only 1 % of @entity265 -- mostly @entity267 @entity266 -- and no african - americans or @entity269 have this particular mutation			2
in june , five years after he was " cured , " reports surfaced that " traces " of the virus had been found in @entity241 's blood			2
even then , some @entity2 experts said that does n't matter , that he 's been cured			1
in fact , many @entity8 experts said they believe @entity241 has experienced what 's called a " sterilizing " cure , meaning the virus has been eliminated from the body entirely			0
routine clinical testing on the @entity23 toddler continues , @entity44 said			0
so far , there is no evidence of the virus			0
" on the ultra-sensitive testing , we are occasionally getting signals so we can not say with certainty that this child is absolutely clear of @entity2 , but we will continue to follow up with the baby , " @entity68 said			1
" we have formed a hypothesis and that is already driving the design of new studies and clinical trials that will help us to answer the question of whether by coming in very early we will be able to treat children for a while and then remove them from therapy			2
" get the latest news from @entity305			0

doctors treat girl who was born @entity2 positive
they treated her with drugs before diagnosis was confirmed
she is now considered " functionally cured " of @entity2 , researchers say
researchers hope to one day *improve* outcomes for other *people*
