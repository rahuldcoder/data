-- call it odd , but i 'm a self - appointed airport sleuth			1
i apply this title to travelers who weave their way in and out of airport terminals , bypassing lines , crowds and stress , and ultimately finding devilish gratification in knowing what others do n't			1
as a longtime resident of @entity15 , i 've passed through the world 's busiest airport hundreds of times and have a few handy tricks that make life a bit easier , faster and more comfortable			1
it 's not very sleuth - like of me to share my secrets , but my hope is you 'll share yours , and together , we can expand our sleuth - like ways ... 1			1
if you 're dropping off or picking up someone from the north or south side , use the downstairs entrance instead of the upstairs			0
there are check - in kiosks and baggage services below ( south side only ) and barely any lines or even cops to tell you to keep moving			1
it 's guaranteed to save you time			1
plus , you avoid the crowds and chaos above as you slip past the masses with ease			0
there 's a lesser - known security checkpoint with six lanes by the @entity50 check - in counter on the north side			1
also , on the south side past @entity54 ticketing and the @entity56 store , you 'll see @entity54 's own set of four security lanes			2
if the main security is super busy , try either of these as a possible faster option , no matter which airline you 're flying			2
road warriors ' best tips for smooth travel 3			0
if you 're lucky enough to be departing from the @entity65 , enter through the side security lanes , ( either north or south ) and then walk to the @entity65			0
this is actually faster than going through the main security and taking the tram			2
i love the @entity65 ! 4			0
when heading to baggage claim after your flight arrives ( from @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 or e terminals ) , be sure to board the very first car of the tram			0
this will let you out in front of the hordes of people now behind you and up the escalator to baggage claim first			0
freedom ! it 's one of my favorite secrets , so shhh ... 5			2
@entity91 is n't free at the airport , unless you 're at the @entity95 food court			1
@entity96 provides the free service that can help time slip on by			2
so if you have a long layover , take the tram to @entity102 , and maybe you 'll have the added benefit of meeting a cute international man ( or woman ) of mystery			0
what airport sleuth would n't love that ? 6			1
exhausted from traveling , and have a long layover ? go to @entity110 at @entity111			1
here , full - service secluded napping stations are offered for $ 30 an hour			1
@entity110 was the first of its kind in the country			0
( @entity117 is now the second			0
) besides a daybed and blankets , each suite offers a high - definition television and workstation with a phone , desk , office chair and @entity127			1
as soon as you find out your flight is delayed , be the sleuth that you are and leave your irked co-passengers behind in exchange for some quiet time with your feet up , door shut , blanket tucked and the tv tuned to " @entity137			2
" ( oh , how i love that show			0
) this is n't the airline i signed up for 7			0
flying can be uncomfortable enough , so i believe in making airport time a bit indulgent			2
@entity73 ( across from the food court ) and @entity75 ( opposite @entity145 ) have an @entity146			1
prices are $ 20 for a manicure or $ 25 for a 10 - minute massage			1
or grab an old - fashioned shoeshine offered at gates @entity152 and @entity153			2
a bit of glam goes a long way for the airport sleuth			1
sign up for @entity158 , the free service offered by @entity15 that provides updated flight information to e-mail accounts , pdas or mobile devices			1
this service provides instant access to any changes made to your flight			0
knowledge is key if you want to take this title seriously			0
want to forgo fast food for a fine dining experience ? then head to the @entity173 and grab a seat at " @entity175			2
" a couple of entree highlights are @entity178 and @entity179 and @entity180 crusted @entity181			0
the restaurant also has an excellent sushi menu			0
for dessert , i suggest the sublime red wine and ginger - poached plums that make you forget you 're at an airport			1
or if you 're just in need of a scrumptious cocktail , saddle up to the bar for the " @entity194 , " made with @entity196 's @entity195 , @entity197 and organic bitters			0
that delicious @entity199 makes me sigh with happiness every time			0
@entity201 : tips for speaking @entity203 abroad have some secret tips to share in navigating @entity15 or your own hometown airport ? i want in on them ! please share your comments and suggestions below			1
and shhh ... let 's keep this between us !			0
