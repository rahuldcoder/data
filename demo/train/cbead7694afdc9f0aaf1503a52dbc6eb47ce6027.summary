-- @entity1 took its latest powerful toy , a new stealth fighter jet , out for its first test spin tuesday , leading @entity6 defense secretary @entity5 to wonder whether the flight was scheduled to coincide with his visit			1
" i asked president @entity12 ( @entity12 ) about it directly , " @entity5 said at a briefing with reporters in @entity11			2
" and he said that the test had absolutely nothing to do with my visit and had been a pre-planned test			2
and that 's where we left it			0
" images and videos of @entity1 's latest generation fighter , being called the @entity26 , hit the web in a frenzy of excitement in late december			0
onlookers outside the airfield base have been allowed to use cell phones to snap pictures and record low resolution video , a decision that many experts point to as a move by @entity1 to pump its chest in advance of @entity5 ' trip to @entity1 and @entity12 's visit to the @entity6 next week			1
tuesday 's test flight appeared to be no different in regard to the viral marketing			0
videos and pictures have hit the web , some showing crowds of people lined up alongside the airfield gate in southern @entity1 , cheering and jumping up and down as the fighter lands			0
gates however , who made the trip to discuss military relations between the @entity6 and @entity1 , said he believes the @entity1 president 's assurance that the test flight had been previously planned			1
" i take president @entity12 at his word that ... the test had nothing to do with my visit , " @entity5 said			1
one @entity1 watcher is skeptical			1
" it was planned this way , a classic exercise in power projection , " said @entity1 military scholar @entity64			1
" they want president @entity70 and the new @entity71 to view @entity12 , who visits next week , as the leader of the next military superpower , whose demands must be accommodated			0
" analysts believe the j - 20 stealth fighter will have the radar - evading capability of fifth - generation fighters produced by the @entity6 , like the @entity79 and @entity80			0
and while the jet is n't supposed to be operational until at least 2017 , @entity64 said that after tuesday 's test flight , @entity1 has the potential to deploy the fighter at an earlier date using a less - powerful engine than the one currently in development			1
@entity5 conceded that fact on his flight over to @entity1 last weekend			2
" i think that what we 've seen is that they may be somewhat further ahead in the development of that aircraft than our intelligence had earlier predicted , " @entity5 said			0
still , @entity5 downplayed the technical advancements in the plane , questioning how " stealthy , " or radar evading , it actually is			0
in 2009 , @entity5 said that no nation comes close to the @entity6 ' air power , and he expected the @entity1 to have only " a handful " of fighters that could challenge the @entity6 advanced fleets by 2025			1
despite tuesday 's air show by the @entity1 , @entity5 said he would not revise that assessment and added that another @entity108 power , @entity109 , is considering purchasing its next generation of fighter aircraft			2
" and i might have a few suggestions for them , " @entity5 said .			0

@entity5 says the @entity1 president said the *timing* of the test was coincidental
a @entity1 watcher , however , says it coincided with @entity5 ' visit on purpose
" a classic exercise in power projection , " says @entity1 military scholar @entity64
