@entity0 -- prince @entity2 slipped a gold ring onto the finger of @entity5 friday , and the couple vowed to love , comfort , honor and to keep each other in @entity0 's biggest royal wedding in three decades			1
bells pealed over central @entity0 and flag - waving crowds roared in excitement friday as @entity5 arrived at @entity14 to marry @entity2 , the second in line to the @entity18 throne			1
@entity5 wore an ivory and white satin dress with lace sleeves and shoulders , designed by @entity22 of the @entity24 fashion house			1
royal wedding : the big day " you look beautiful , " the prince told her as she arrived at the altar on the arm of her father @entity30			1
@entity2 wore the uniform of a colonel of the @entity35 , a scarlet jacket and blue sash , as his brother , prince @entity38 , accompanied him into the abbey			1
crowds cheered as his car drove the short distance from @entity43 to the abbey before the wedding , and they roared and waved as the newlyweds rode in an open carriage from the abbey to @entity49 after the ceremony			1
royal wedding : the dress a million people lined the wedding route , police said			1
the couple appeared before about half a million cheering supporters on a balcony of the palace and exchanged a quick kiss on the lips -- then pecked each other 's lips again a moment later			1
@entity65 jets then flew over the crowd and the palace in formation , the official climax of the wedding celebration			2
royal wedding : hats galore the prince and duchess went inside to a lunchtime reception for 650 people , hosted by @entity78 it featured an eight - tier wedding cake , the palace announced			1
they left about two hours later in an open - topped dark blue @entity82 with a license plate reading " @entity85 , " @entity2 at the wheel			1
the car is one prince @entity89 has owned since 1969 and had converted in 2008 to run on biofuel made from @entity92 wine wastage , his office announced			2
a search and rescue helicoper flew past as the newlyweds left the palace			2
the couple will be known as the @entity98 and @entity5 following their marriage , the royal family announced shortly before the wedding -- thus avoiding giving the newest member of the royal family any title that would implicitly compare her to @entity104 , @entity104			1
the most devoted monarchists arrived days before the event and camped out with @entity107 on their clothes , tents and faces			0
some traveled from as far away as @entity112			0
up to half a million people who did n't get one of the 1,900 invitations to @entity14 were expected to watch the event on giant screens at @entity118 in central @entity0			1
@entity119 , queens , priests and politicians began to arrive at the abbey shortly after 8 a.m. , with celebrities such as sir @entity125 and @entity127 gold medallist @entity126 among them			0
@entity128 arrived with his wife @entity129 , with the soccer star sporting his @entity132 medal on the right lapel of his morning coat			0
medals are traditionally worn on the left			0
street parties are being held across the @entity18 , while protests threatened by @entity140 radicals , anarchists and anti-royalists largely failed to materialize			0
about 5,000 police officers are out on the streets , including 110 on horseback and 35 with sniffer dogs			2
@entity0 's @entity146 reported 45 arrests by the time the reception began , mostly for breaches of the peace			1
the world 's media have deployed even more resources than the police did , with at least 8,000 staff working in @entity0 for the event			1
@entity18 culture secretary @entity157 predicted the ceremony would be seen by an estimated 2 billion people worldwide			2
but the @entity18 themselves are lukewarm about the event , with just under half saying they were planning to watch it on television , and 56 % saying they were not interested			0
@entity2 announced his engagement to @entity5 in november after proposing secretly in a rustic cabin in @entity169 in october			1
he 's the older son of @entity89 and the late @entity104 , @entity104 ; a grandson of @entity78 ; a military search - and - rescue helicopter pilot and , by one recent measure , the most popular member of the royal family			2
@entity5 is an art history graduate and the eldest child of self - made millionaires who run a party - supplies company			1
widely known as @entity5 before her wedding , the bride has now asked that she be called @entity5 , the royal family said in the run - up to the wedding			1
they met as college students at the @entity184 in @entity185 , sharing an apartment with a circle of friends before they began dating			0
she first caught his eye when she modelled in a student fashion show wearing a see - through dress over her underwear , @entity18 reports have said			2
the couple married at @entity14 , where @entity18 monarchs are crowned , sometimes married , and often buried , alongside major figures from @entity18 history including @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204			0
the guests included " @entity207 " actor @entity206 , a personal friend of prince @entity89 ; and former @entity18 prime minister @entity209			2
but the guest list is as notable for who was n't on it as who was			0
former prime ministers @entity214 and @entity216 were not invited , leading to accusations that the royal family favors the conservative party over @entity220			2
@entity49 responded that @entity209 was invited not because he was a @entity221 but because he was appointed guardian of prince @entity2 and his younger brother @entity38 when their mother @entity104 died in a car crash in 1997			1
@entity228 , a conservative and the other living former prime minister , declined the invitation			0
she failed to appear at a @entity233 event in her honor last year because of ill health			0
@entity237 president @entity236 also was n't invited , raising some eyebrows			0
the royal family explained that as a matter of protocol , presidents were not invited			0
the @entity237 ambassador to @entity0 was on the guest list , as were most members of @entity0 's diplomatic corps			2
but @entity248 's ambassador was uninvited just a day before the wedding in light of his government 's current crackdown on protesters			0
the @entity255 of @entity256 , whose country is also clamping down on demonstrations , was invited but on sunday decided not to attend			0
the controversies and the couple aside , the wedding was a very traditional @entity18 event in some respects			0
it included the @entity265 , hymns and @entity268 readings typical of @entity92 nuptials , and the always nervous moment when the priest asks that if anyone present knows of a lawful impediment to the marriage , he speak now or " hereafter forever hold his peace			0
" of course , the priest asking that question friday was @entity280 , the archbishop of @entity281 , the titular head of the worldwide @entity284 church			0
and while it 's not unheard of for @entity18 weddings to include a singing of " @entity289 , " this one was unusual in that the monarch in question was actually standing in the front row for it			0
@entity2 gave @entity5 a ring of @entity296 gold , but she did n't return the favour -- and she did not , in her vows , promise to obey him			1
of course , if @entity2 does some day become king , @entity5 will then presumably have to obey him			1
a @entity301 poll for @entity1 when the engagement was announced in november found that just over half of @entity18 adults thought @entity2 would make a better king than his father @entity89 , heir to the throne ; 58 % said @entity5 would make a better queen than @entity89 's second wife , @entity309 , the @entity309			1
but the online poll 's 2,015 respondents were split on the largely theoretical question of whether the crown should actually skip a generation and pass directly to @entity2 when his grandmother @entity78 dies			2
forty - five percent said it should , while 41 % said it should not			0
@entity1 's @entity318 and @entity319 contributed to this report .			0
