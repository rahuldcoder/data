on monday , a portion of the ashes of 20 - year - old @entity8 are expected to be launched into space by a @entity11 company called @entity12 , which has been sending cremated remains into @entity14 orbit , onto the lunar surface or into deep space since 1997			1
" we did n't even know this was a possibility , " @entity1 said			2
" when @entity12 reached out to us we were literally blown away			2
we were very emotional when we found out not only that was this something that can happen but that the ceo was offering us a sort of complimentary ride into space			1
" monday 's launch of a @entity26 rocket carrying the " @entity12 cremation memorials " of @entity8 and others is scheduled to take place at @entity31 's @entity30			1
it will be the company 's 13th launch , delivering remains to the weightlessness of space before returning them to @entity14			1

" many of those scattering the ashes have also been affected by suicide or have outlived their children , she said			1
@entity1 said she has regretted the argument she had with her son moments before he stormed out of their home and shot himself on april 15 , 2010			2
