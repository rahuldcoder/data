@entity0 -- this weekend 's @entity3 election is testing the strength of the nation 's young democracy and could be a turning point in the history of the @entity9 , says analyst @entity10			1
in the march 7 election , @entity3 prime minister @entity12 's coalition in the @entity3 parliament is seeking to win enough votes to keep him in office for another term			1
on thursday , a series of insurgent attacks led to the deaths of 29 people in the city of @entity23			0
@entity10 said the election could have a lasting impact : " it might be the turning point in the rise of @entity3 in the @entity9			1
@entity3 is one of the largest , most important countries in the @entity30 world			1
it has the third or fourth largest petroleum reserves in the world			0
even now it has $ 40 billion in oil revenues every year ; it has a well - trained army thanks to the @entity36			0
" it is perhaps the beginning of a return to prominence in the @entity9			0
it is possible that 10 years from now we 'll look back and say , while everyone was obsessing about the rise of @entity46 , the real story in the @entity9 in these years was the rise of @entity3			2
" the @entity49 administration plans to withdraw all combat troops from @entity3 by the end of august , leaving 50,000 @entity36 in advisory roles , who will leave by the end of 2011			2
@entity10 , author and host of @entity1 's " @entity56 , " spoke to @entity1 on thursday			1
here is an edited transcript : @entity1 : what 's at stake in the election ? @entity10 : this is really the first genuine election @entity3 will have since the @entity36 invasion			1
it is only the second time that @entity3 is having an election for the full parliamentary term			1
and the first one had limited @entity70 participation			0
there was a lot of violence surrounding it , and so it had a kind of air of abnormality to it			0
this is coming after a pretty stable period both politically and economically and also a period of very spirited campaigning , and so it has the potential to really consolidate @entity3 democracy and @entity3 political stability			1
but a lot will depend on what happens , not in the election itself , but right after			0
@entity1 : why should @entity36 pay particular attention to what 's happening with this election ? @entity10 : two reasons : first if @entity3 is able to achieve some degree of consolidation in terms of its democracy , it will add dramatically to its political stability , which is of course the most important condition that will allow @entity36 forces to continue their withdrawal down to zero combat forces or close to zero combat forces , as president @entity49 has hoped			1
and the second is , if @entity3 is able to consolidate as a democracy , it will mean there will have been some success in @entity3 that we can point to for the vast investment and the vast expenditure of blood and treasure that the @entity36 has put in			1
i 'm not saying that you can make an easy statement that this justifies the invasion , i 'm simply saying that there will be a very strong positive outcome in @entity3 that will at least be set against the cost			2
and that positive outcome is that @entity3 will be the first @entity30 country to have a genuine functioning democratic system with a free press , open economy and that is something of a revolution in the @entity9			1
@entity1 : how is the election shaping up ? @entity10 : the most important part is what happens after the election			1
what you really have to watch is not how the winners are treated , but how the losers are treated , because @entity3 has yet to demonstrate that it can handle the issue of minority rights properly			1
the @entity70 who were once the ruling elite are now somewhat marginalized			0
the @entity139 have their own difficulties with the @entity142 government			0
the @entity143 have been very substantially persecuted in many different ways and often , very sadly , killed			0
so what @entity3 has to demonstrate is that the majority , which will inevitably be largely shia , has the capacity to give some form of representation to the various minorities within @entity3			1
@entity3 has to show that it understands that democracy is not just majority rule but pluralism and inclusion for the various minority groups			1
. that 's a very important point because while the @entity70 are the minority in @entity3 , they are the majority everywhere else in the @entity30 world			1
so when @entity30 look at @entity3 , right now what they see is a kind of majority tyranny			1
@entity1 : are you seeing any signs that the @entity147 majority is fully open to the kind of embrace of minority rights you 're talking about ? @entity10 : the most important sign is that the @entity147 have not consolidated as one bloc , so there are now various @entity147 groups , some of which are inclined to this kind of inclusion			2
but at least it gives the voters choices , and the group that seems to be doing second best in the polls after prime minister @entity12 's group is headed by @entity185 , a former prime minister			0
he is a very secular - minded guy who has a lot of appeal to @entity70 , has @entity70 partners in his coalition at very high levels and represents a very different kind of @entity147 politics , much more secular , much more inclusive			0
it 's also worth saying that the @entity70 are not trying to resort to violence as a routine matter the way they were four or five years ago			0
they seem to understand that their path to rehabilitation lies in politics , not in civil war			0
somebody once said to me , you will know the @entity3 insurgency is over once the @entity147 understand that they have won and the @entity70 understand that they have lost			2
and i think both those conditions have now been fulfilled			0
@entity1 : what 's the impact of the violence we have seen so far ? @entity10 : minimal , because the violence has not been particularly dramatic			2
look , @entity3 is now an open society			2
it 's very difficult to protect every caf√© and every bus station , but most importantly it is not having much effect in deterring people from voting			0
when all is said and done , violence in @entity3 is down 95 percent from 2006			2
while it 's unfortunate , it is not debilitating			0
@entity1 : what 's the potential impact of the elections on relations with @entity46 ? @entity10 : one of the things that i 've noticed is reports that are coming out that @entity46 agents who used to spend a lot of time in @entity3 are actually less present there than they had been in the past			1
that is perhaps in large measure because they 're back in @entity46 trying to quell and counteract the green movement there			0
a consolidated government in @entity3 with new legitimacy is going to be an @entity3 that is less amenable to pressures from @entity46			2
@entity1 : based on where we are right now , how do you think history is going to judge the @entity36 invasion ? @entity10 : we spent about a trillion dollars in @entity3 , not to mention the loss of blood , which is tragic of course			1
not just the @entity36 but many more @entity3			2
so in the long arc of history was this worth it ? you probably do need a little more time and perspective , and you do need to see how it turns out			0
but i think we could be heartened by the fact there are things we can place on the positive side of the ledger to balance the enormous costs that both the @entity3 and the @entity36 have paid			2
@entity1 : what impact do you think the election will have on the @entity49 administration 's plan to withdraw troops from @entity3 ? @entity10 : the greater the political stability in @entity3 , the easier it will be for the withdrawal to proceed apace			1
right now i do n't see a major obstacle to continuing the withdrawal			0
but on my sunday program , @entity266 hinted for the first time that there could be an arrangement reached with the @entity3 government under which a small contingent of @entity36 troops stay in @entity3 for a longer period of time .			0

@entity3 holds a *key* parliamentary election march 7
@entity10 says this is a test of the *vibrancy* of @entity3 's democracy
he says it will be crucial for @entity3 to show that rights of minorities will be protected
@entity3 could emerge as a more powerful nation and a model for democracy in the @entity30 world
