-- @entity2 's @entity1 won stage 10 to hand @entity6 's @entity5 team their first victory in the @entity8			1
@entity1 narrowly held off @entity9 of @entity10 after both riders launched a bid for the line with 14km of the stage remaining			1
the peloton never threatened to go with the pair and rolled in at their leisure , with @entity1 becoming the first @entity19 stage winner since @entity20 in 1989			1
it brought some comfort to his @entity5 team , led by @entity25 @entity6 , who conceded his chances of winning the @entity8 disappeared over the weekend			1
@entity28 's overall lead was never threatened during the 179km stage from @entity30 to gap , while the home crowd could not celebrate a local winner in sweltering temperatures on @entity34			2
@entity36 's @entity35 led the peloton home and finished ninth grabbing 12 points in the green jersey standings			2
@entity43 's @entity42 came tenth			2
the top ten riders in the general classification standings were unchanged meaning race leader @entity28 made sure he retained the yellow jersey for another day			1
@entity1 , who won a silver medal at the @entity49 in the road race , was part of a six - man break and only a determined sprint prevented @entity9 picking up @entity10 ' first ever tour win			1
" it was a close sprint but the most important thing is to win and so this moment , for me and my team , is a good one , " @entity1 told the official @entity8 website			1
" i hope that in the coming days the team can achieve a few more victories			0
" for me this victory is more important than the silver medal in the @entity64			0
this is the best race in the world and to win one stage in the @entity8 is the pinnacle of what a cyclist can achieve			2
" overall leader @entity28 was pleased with a comfortable day in the saddle : " it was quite an easy day even if it was fast at the beginning			0
it was a breakaway day so we took it kind of easy behind			0
" okay , there was a lot of wind so the team had to do some work all the way to gap but it was n't too stressful			0
i had a little bit of time to enjoy my first day in the yellow jersey			0
" it was not a day for me to do anything			0
even if it was quite up and down , there was nothing for me to achieve			0
