editor 's note : @entity2 is a senior writer and columnist for @entity4 and @entity5 , and has contributed to @entity7 's @entity6 , outside the @entity8			1
he is the 2009 @entity9 ( @entity9 ) award winner for online journalism and the 2008 @entity12 ( @entity12 ) winner for column writing			0
@entity2 says criticism of president @entity15 by the gay community has gone too far			1
( @entity17 ) -- far from flowing rainbow flags , the sound of @entity19 and , quite honestly , white people , stands a nightclub just outside of @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 , by the name of @entity27			0
the line to get in usually stretches down the block , and unlike many of the clubs in @entity33 and @entity34 , this one plays hip - hop and caters to men who may or may not openly identify as gay , but without question are black and proud			1
and a good number of them are tired of hearing how the gay community is disappointed in president @entity15 , because they are not			1
in recent weeks , one would have thought the nation 's first black president was also the nation 's biggest homophobe			1
everyone from @entity49 winner @entity48 and radio personality @entity50 to @entity51 , the president of @entity52 , the country 's largest gay advocacy group , seem to be blasting @entity15 for everything from " do n't ask do n't tell " to @entity55 not winning @entity56			1
in their minds , @entity15 is not moving fast enough on behalf of the @entity60 community			1
the outcry is not completely without merit -- the @entity64 's unnerving brief on the @entity65 immediately comes to mind			0
i was upset by some of the statements , but not surprised			0
( after the @entity71 , president @entity73 's initial handling of @entity74 and , more recently , @entity75 , there is little that surprises me when it comes to the government and the treatment of its people			2
) still , rarely has criticism regarding @entity15 and the @entity60 community come from the kind of person you would find standing in line at a spot like @entity27 , and there 's a reason for that			1
despite the catchiness of the slogan , gay is not the new black			1
and if any group should know this , it 's the gay community			2
bars such as @entity27 , or @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity100 , exist because a large number of gay blacks -- particularly those who date other blacks , and live in the black community -- do not feel a part of the larger gay movement			1
there are @entity109 celebrations , and then there are @entity111			0
there 's a popular bar in the heart of the nation 's capital that might as well rename itself @entity117 , because all of the white patrons tend to stay upstairs and the black patrons are on the first floor			2
last year at the annual @entity52 national fundraiser in @entity123 -- an event that lasted more than three hours -- the only black person to make it on stage was the entertainment			0
when @entity130 passed in @entity131 , white gays were quick to blame the black community despite blacks making up less than 10 percent of total voters and whites being close to 60 percent			1
at protest rallies that followed , some gay blacks reported they were even hit with racial epithets by angry white participants			1
not to split hairs , but for most blacks , the n - word trumps the f - word			2
so while the white mouthpiece of the gay community shakes an angry finger at intolerance and bigotry in their blogs and on television , blacks and other minorities see the dirty laundry			2
they see the hypocrisy of publicly rallying in the name of unity but then privately living in segregated pockets			0
and then there is the history			0
the 40th anniversary of @entity163 dominated @entity109 celebrations around the country , and while that is certainly a significant moment that should be recognized , 40 years is nothing compared with the 400 blood - soaked years black people have been through in this country			2
there are stories some blacks lived through , stories others were told by their parents and stories that never had a chance to be told			0
while those who were at @entity163 talk about the fear of being arrested by police , 40 years ago , blacks talked about the fear of dying at the hands of police and not having their bodies found or murder investigated			0
the 13th amendment was signed in 1865 , and it was n't until 1948 that president @entity187 desegregated the military			0
that 's more than an 80 - year gap			0
not to be flip , but @entity191 is older than @entity193 's " @entity192			0
" that does n't mean that the safety of gay people should be trivialized or that @entity15 should not be held accountable for the promises he made on the campaign trail			1
but to call this month 's first - ever @entity200 reception for @entity60 leaders " too little too late " is akin to a petulant child throwing a tantrum because he wants to eat his dessert before dinner			0
this is one of the main reasons why so many blacks bristle at the comparison of the two movements -- everybody wants to sing the blues , nobody wants to live them			0
this lack of perspective is only going to alienate a black community that is still very proud of @entity15 and is hypersensitive about any criticism of him , especially given he 's been in office barely six months			1
if blacks are less accepting of gays than other racial groups -- and that is certainly debatable -- then the parade of gay people calling @entity15 a " disappointment " on television is counterproductive in gaining acceptance , to say the least			1
and the fact that the loudest critics are mostly white does n't help matters either			0
hearing that race matters in the gay community may not be comforting to hear , but that does n't make it any less true			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : blacks tired of hearing about gays ' disappointment in @entity15
he says black gays *strongly* support first @entity249 - @entity248 president
he says gay **rights** movement is not comparable to the civil **rights** *struggle*
@entity2 : gay movement has to *overcome* its own racial issues
