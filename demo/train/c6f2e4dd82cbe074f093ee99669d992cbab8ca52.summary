@entity28 said officers used a " flash bang " device , entered the home and encountered a 46 - year - old female inside the front room			1

" no murder suspect was found in @entity84 's house , " @entity8 said in monday 's interview			2

we know that no words can do anything to take away the pain you are feeling at this time			0
" police obtained the " high - risk search warrant " based on intelligence , and it was approved by the prosecutor and a magistrate , @entity28 said			0
