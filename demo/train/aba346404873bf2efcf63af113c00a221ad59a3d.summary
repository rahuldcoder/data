@entity0 -- let 's just come out and say what a lot of people are thinking this @entity6 weekend : @entity0 ? really ? hard - core fans who blow wads of cash every season to get their championship tickets punched want to know : has the @entity12 reached a point when this iconic face - off between our national gladiators can be hosted by any team city ? even a cold - weather , landlocked , midsize burg surrounded by corn and guided by a mysterious force called " @entity22 " ? because , sorry sports fans , let 's be real : this ai n't @entity26 , @entity27 or @entity28 -- or any of the sunshiny february playgrounds that have dominated location choices for 45 years			1
this is smack in the heart of " flyover country , " where many fans of the @entity35 and @entity36 have never before dared to venture			1
you can picture them trying to locate the home of the @entity41 on a map , saying , " it 's in one of those ' i ' states , like @entity47 , @entity48 or @entity49			2
" there 's no need to mince words			2
@entity54 natives have heard it all before : " nap - town , " " @entity57 - no - place			2
" " hoosiers , " as @entity63 residents call themselves , are used to being underestimated , and they often take advantage of the benefits of low expectations			2
( full disclosure : the author is an @entity63 native , but , like many of his kind , he is unable to explain the origin of the word " @entity22			2
" ) after decades of strategizing , planning and selling the city to @entity12 team owners , @entity54 says it 's ready to host @entity73			1
" it 's the pinnacle , " said former mayor @entity74 , who started the campaign rolling in the early ' 80s			2
without a doubt , preparations have transformed the town 's look and feel			0
the community has poured hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars and corporate coin to build new hotels , spruce up landscaping and resurface miles of streets			0
as a result , a sea of @entity35 blue , @entity36 blue and @entity41 blue has been flowing through the downtown area -- now dubbed @entity94			1
more than 300,000 have walked through the neighborhood in the past week , officials said			1
former @entity41 head coach @entity97 told @entity1 affiliate @entity98 that the city is putting " its best foot forward			2
" the fans are " going to be pleasantly surprised , " he said			0
there 's more to @entity54 than the @entity6 restaurants , hotels and the village all surround @entity107 -- creating a compact , walkable @entity6 district that veterans say is unique to almost all previous venues except perhaps @entity26			1
" i think the setup here is fantastic , " @entity12 commissioner @entity111 told @entity98			1
streets have been renamed @entity115 -- one for each @entity12 squad			1
" @entity117 and @entity118 are coming in tonight ! " a fan shouted to a friend wearing a @entity36 jersey			1
buildings are draped with majestic , gigantic multistory banners , and the street signs are adorned with the ubiquitous face of @entity126 , the @entity6 halftime headliner parlor games ? " oh no , here we go , " say local skeptics -- eyes rolling			1
" this is the part where the media elite play that tired parlor game that comes up every time @entity63 takes the national stage			0
" does @entity0 have to prove anything by hosting the game ? is this about some kind of cornfed inferiority complex that @entity140 have been trying to shake for decades ? " we 're not about that , " said @entity141 of @entity0 ' @entity6 host committee			1
" we let our actions speak louder than our words			0
" it 's all a little shocking for those who remember what this neighborhood was like 30 years ago			1
there was n't much here			0
for workers at the old brick - walled @entity156 's @entity155 building on @entity158 -- a stone 's throw from the stadium -- there were no bars or nightspots for hanging out after quittin ' time			0
" you could count the number of restaurants on one hand , " @entity164 said			0
" you just did n't come downtown to have fun back then			2
" in the old days , @entity0 meant the " brickyard " -- the @entity54 , said @entity170 , longtime co-host of the @entity54 - based syndicated radio program " the @entity172			1
" " but after the arrival of @entity176 , now they say ' the @entity41			0
' " the image of @entity176 's face looms large on a building - size @entity180 's banner in @entity94			1
fourteen years after @entity176 joined the @entity41 , @entity182 are indeed talking about the $ 90 million quarterback			2
specifically , they 're talking about his neck			0
@entity176 's recovery from neck surgery -- perhaps the most talked about neck in the history of sports -- threatens to overshadow sunday 's game , which will feature @entity176 's brother @entity191 as quarterback for the @entity36			1
most people know the injury forced @entity176 to sit out the @entity41 ' entire season , resulting in two wins and 14 losses -- a stinking record after 2010 's 10 - 6 season			0
now the @entity41 face an epic decision about whether to pay @entity176 a $ 28 million bonus to stay on the team or to cut him loose as a free agent			0
has @entity176 played his last game with the @entity41 ? @entity0 had its own epic decision to make in the early ' 80s			1
at the time , the city had no @entity12 team			1
yet @entity209 , then the mayor , greenlit construction of a $ 77 million - domed football stadium			0
@entity54 was putting out bait to lure the @entity12			1
" stones of steel , " said a fan who recalled the story while walking through @entity94 on tuesday			1
" before the stadium was finished , the @entity41 had agreed to move from @entity220 to @entity54 , triggering a generation of hatred among the @entity225 city 's fans over the " theft " of their storied franchise			2
it was a major step toward using sports to crank up @entity54 's status and economic standing			0
soon the city was hosting @entity235 basketball 's @entity233 and the @entity237 @entity236			1
" gradually in the ' 80s and ' 90s people who knew the city regarded @entity0 as quite a town -- even though people who did n't know @entity54 still thought of it as a brickyard and a cornfield , " @entity74 said			1
fast - forward to sunday when perhaps more than 112 million people will watch the @entity12 world championship " taking place in little old @entity0 , " said @entity170 , the radio host			1
the hosting seems to be going well so far -- thanks in part to unusually warm temperatures in the low 50s at a time when it 's usually a few degrees above freezing			2
" we 're loving it			0
i had to get out here in the village and see everybody ! " @entity164 said			0
" outstanding " was how @entity41 wide receiver @entity265 described the weather for @entity98			0
" everyone seems to be enjoying themselves , " @entity265 said , a year after a freak cold snap put a damper on events surrounding the @entity271			1
" i have n't heard one bad complaint			0
" in 1982 , @entity275 opened the door to cold - weather @entity6 hosting			1
@entity278 is scheduled for 2014			0
" our plan was to eventually get into the rotation for future @entity6 , " @entity74 said			1
" let 's get through the first one , first , " the @entity12 's @entity111 told @entity98			1
" i think the hospitality and the way they have done this will reflect very well on @entity0 going forward			1
" @entity287 the village -- a $ 12 million , three - block , " family - friendly festival " with shops and restaurants -- has been built not just for sunday , but for the future			0
" after the fans have long gone , other people are going to be able to come in and use this space for decades , " @entity164 said			0
meantime , @entity164 said she expects @entity54 to demonstrate the spirit of " @entity22			0
" " we 're a friendly folk , " she said			0
" people say hi to you when you walk down the street			0
it 's all the time , not just when the @entity6 is here			1
" what 's getting the most attention ? the zip line is the talk of the town			0
for $ 10 , you can climb the zip line 's 95 - foot tower , attach yourself to a metal cable and fly 80 feet above the crowd to another tower 650 feet down the street			0
" it 's the new version of the bungee jump , " one woman said			0
fans reported the wait last sunday for the zip line was seven hours			0
that 's almost as long as tv 's @entity6 pregame show			1
homeless complaints but not everyone in @entity0 is awaiting the big game			1
@entity329 , 33 , a homeless man from @entity28 , said , " starting at the end of last week the police started pushing us away from certain areas that we 're allowed to be in , " including the @entity94			1
authorities insist officers are n't cracking down because of the game , but they said police are working with private organizations to help get the homeless into shelters			0
" we 're not moving anyone against their will , " said @entity341 , spokesman for @entity0 mayor @entity342			2
the city is sharing its @entity6 gravy with needy segments of the community			1
a neighborhood without a grocery store now has a food cooperative thanks to private and @entity12 funds , @entity164 said			2
another area received a 20,000 - square - foot community youth center , including a gym , classrooms and weekly programs such as cooking , fitness and finance			2
hosting this game is " a step of a higher level than we 've ever taken before , " @entity74 said			2
" we had to prove that we could be major league			0
" so what 's next for @entity54 ? a @entity369 or @entity370 national convention may not be out of the question , he said			0
and what about sunday ? " the best sign of success will be that the city does n't become the story , " @entity170 said			2
" the story needs to be about the game			0
i honestly think the best report would be people saying that ' the game was great and -- oh yeah by the way @entity0 was really nice			2
i had a really good time			0

@entity0 is hosting its first @entity6 as the @entity36 take on the @entity35
city officials set @entity6 goal almost 30 years ago
more than 300,000 are visiting downtown area dubbed @entity94
*initial* @entity12 hosting reviews are *positive* a year after cold snap *marred* @entity271
