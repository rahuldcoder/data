@entity0 -- @entity3 's share price has fallen more than 25 % since its record high set three months ago -- no less than five analysts have lowered their price targets for the @entity8 technology giant in the past few days			1
to make matters worse for @entity3 , @entity10 smartphones continue to reign supreme in global market share : for every one such device running on @entity3 's @entity14 , about seven smartphones running @entity10 's operating system are computing away			1
is @entity3 losing its bite ? in the short - term , investors and analysts seem to think so			2
but in the medium - term , they believe milestones exist that can put the shine back on @entity3 's share price and image			1
apples do fall on september 19 , @entity3 's share price closed at a historic high of $ 702.10 , exactly one week after the debut of the @entity30			1
but as the freshness of the device 's latest iteration wore off , so did the bullishness for @entity3 's stock			2
on december 17 , it fell below the psychological $ 500 - mark , to slide below $ 497 in pre-market trading			0
the company 's share price quickly climbed above that threshold that day but still sits at lows not seen since mid-february			1
the dive in @entity3 's share price has also been attributed to a cut in orders from its parts suppliers			1
one fear is that @entity3 may have produced too many iphone 5s in the current quarter and it may now need to scale back manufacturing in 2013			2
analysts from @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 all cut their price targets on @entity3 leading to a further drop in the @entity58 - based company 's share price			1
another fear is that the @entity30 has not been selling as well as previous versions ; however that has now been debunked			0
a record 19 million @entity30 units are estimated to have been sold in the @entity8 in the fourth quarter of 2012 , according to a survey by @entity65 , which would represent a 33 % year - on - year increase			1
@entity3 also sold more than two million iphone 5 units in @entity68 when it debuted this past weekend			2
" customer response to @entity30 in @entity68 has been incredible , setting a new record with the best first weekend sales ever in @entity68 , " said @entity69 , @entity3 's ceo , in a press release			1
" @entity74 remains on track to launch in 100 countries by the end of the year			0
in our view , this is a positive , " said @entity79 's @entity78			0
comparing apples to @entity84 but for all the hope and the hype that surrounds @entity3 , @entity10 smartphones reign supreme in terms of market share by operating system			0
investment research firm @entity91 says @entity3 has much work to do in 2013			0
" although @entity3 has a robust product pipeline and ample opportunity to gain share in its various end markets , short product life cycles and intense competition will prevent the firm from resting on its laurels , " it wrote in a statement			0
globally , less than two in ten smartphones that shipped in the third quarter of 2012 sported @entity3 's @entity14 operating software			2
but in that same period , @entity106 's @entity10 platform ran 75 % of smartphones around the world			0
this also represented a 91.5 % increase over the same quarter in 2011 , according to @entity111			0
@entity3 's @entity14 claimed just under a 15 % market share in the same period			1
@entity3 's next crop despite the recent release of the @entity30 , analysts are already looking ahead to @entity3 's potential product releases for 2013 to pull the company 's share price up			1
" for @entity3 we believe the sell - off is nearing a bottom but we acknowledge the fears around margins , maps , emerging markets , competition and execution			0
the company clearly needs to ease these concerns in the near future , " said @entity128 ' @entity127			0
" it may take another round of new products and innovations to regain investor confidence and help drive another run			0
" one analyst from @entity139 predicts an @entity140 may ship in the summer of 2013 and that @entity142 prototypes already exist			0
speculation is also growing that @entity3 may debut an @entity3 television set , a so - called @entity145 , by the fall of 2013			2
in a recent @entity65 survey , 47 % of 1,568 respondents said they were " somewhat interested " or " extremely interested " in buying an @entity3 - branded tv set which could translate into 56 million units being sold in the @entity8 alone			1
the report added a potential @entity145 rollout represents a new $ 13 billion opportunity for the world 's most valuable company .			2
