-- triathlon has a reputation for being expensive			2
in fact , the perceived costs are enough to stop some prospective participants from taking up the challenge			2
there 's no doubt that triathlons are harder on the bank balance than other sports , such as running , soccer , baseball or swimming			1
but believe me when i say that you do n't need to max out your credit card to do triathlon , to enjoy triathlon and even to succeed in triathlon			2
in 2007 , i raced my first @entity21 on a road bike ( not the normal @entity24 bike used for @entity21 racing ) with regular wheels			1
i borrowed my friend 's race kit , and wore a $ 20 pair of sunglasses i bought from a gas station in @entity32 three years prior to the race			1
the most important investment you can make is in the form of hard work , drive and determination			2
the most important piece of equipment you can have is a huge heart			2
the most important weapon in triathlon is your mind			0
10 ways to act like a champion having said that , it 's hard to compete in a bike ride without a bike			1
and race directors are not overly keen on your swimming , biking or running in your birthday suit			1
so here are a few items that every triathlete , budding or otherwise , needs to be able to train and race in this amazing sport : goggles : leaky , ill - fitting goggles can cause panic and discomfort			1
if possible , try goggles on before you buy them			0
they should stay on your face , even without the strap			0
your eyelashes should n't touch the lenses , and the nose piece should n't cut you like a knife			0
slightly tinted goggles are best , as they are suitable for both cloudy and sunny conditions			0
wetsuit : wetsuits are mandatory in some races			1
they help keep you warm and also provide buoyancy			1
ideally , your wetsuit should be swim / triathlon specific , rather than a surf wetsuit			0
you do n't need to spend a fortune -- some companies offer one - off , monthly or even season rentals			0
just make sure you swim in the wetsuit before race day and learn how to get it on and off properly			1
it needs to be snug , but not too tight or restrictive			0
@entity93 : these are usually provided by race organizers , but a spare is useful for training and for doubling up if the water is cold			1
bike : you need one , but what kind ? bikes can be few hundred dollars or as much as the price of a car			1
if you 're just starting triathlon and only planning on doing one or two local events , you can use a beach cruiser , shopper or mountain bike			0
but if you are thinking of doing more , it 's probably best to buy a road bike -- which you can train , race and even commute on			1
secondhand bikes can be a great value , but it 's your responsibility to make sure your bike is roadworthy			1
getting a personal " bike - fit " from a bike shop is worthwhile			0
race day tips from an @entity21 champ shoes : whether you use regular or so - called clipless pedals ( a bit of a misnomer , as you actually clip into them ) will depend on your cycling experience and confidence			1
your choice of pedal determines what shoes you wear			0
cleated shoes ( these lock onto the pedals ) are definitely not essential for those new to cycling			0
with flat pedals you can use the same shoes for cycling and running			0
buy a sturdy running shoe that you can trust that suits your form / biomechanics ( a good running shop can help with this )			1
helmet : of course , helmets are a must , but it does n't have to be the all - song - and - dance " aero " kind			0
a regular brain bucket will protect your head fine ; just make sure it has passed the necessary safety tests			0
race suit : you could wear a pair of shorts and a t - shirt under your wetsuit and keep them on until the finish line			1
but while not essential , opting for a tri suit in a race enables you to wear the same outfit from start to finish			1
there are basically two options , a single - piece tri suit , or a two - piece shorts and singlet			0
tri training : taking to open water there are lots of other items that are useful , but not essential , and it 's easy to spend far more than you need to succeed			2
start with the gear listed here , and then make sure you can use it			0
once you fall in love with the sport , and if your wallet can handle the pressure , you may want to add some optional extras or upgrade what you have			0
but remember , it 's not all about the gear			2
it 's about the idea , the plan , the ambition ...			2
