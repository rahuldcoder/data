-- @entity2 authorities are considering the construction of a super-express waterway through @entity5 to prevent future floods similar to the one that has crippled the @entity2 capital and brought manufacturing in other parts of the country to a standstill			1
a team of disaster experts from @entity16 in @entity5 is now investigating permanent solutions to the disaster that has left hundreds dead			0
" one of the urgent solutions is a super-express floodway , " @entity21 , from the university 's @entity19 , told the @entity22			0
under the plan , existing natural canals -- some of them more than 100 kilometers ( 62 miles ) long -- would be linked in a 200 - km " super-highway " that would divert the course of floodwaters from the north			1
the super-canal would hold 1.6 billion cubic meters of water and drain run - off at a rate of 6,000 cubic meters per second -- the equivalent of two and a half @entity38 - sized swimming pools a second			1
" this idea is much cheaper than digging a new river as a floodway , " @entity21 said			0
he said the proposed scheme would involve the construction of a kilometer - wide exclusion zone next to the floodway to prevent properties from being inundated , and a raised highway on both side of the canal			2
the super-express floodway would then drain upstream run - off directly into the sea			1
the university team is also looking at other flood - prevention measures such as a better early - warning system , improved water resource management , a flood tax , the use of a flood - risk map for urban development and groundwater - use controls			2
" now , the government must stop [ trying to ] solve flood problems with political methods , " @entity21 told the @entity22			0
he said poor water management rather than excess rain had caused this year 's severe flooding , adding that natural swamps in the west of @entity2 's @entity70 , which once absorbed water flow , had been developed into industrial and residential areas , blocking the natural floodway			1
while giant flood tunnels in the @entity5 metropolitan area could drain floodwater from the city , they could not cope with a massive inundation from the north			0
" if there is no step forward , foreign investors will eventually disappear from the country and the next generation will be still worried whether flooding will happen or not , " he said .			0

@entity2 authorities consider super-express waterway to prevent future floods

@entity96 would hold 1.6b cubic meters of water and massively *speed* drain run - off
