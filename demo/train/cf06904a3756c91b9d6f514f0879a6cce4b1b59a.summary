@entity0 -- one evening in the spring of 2010 , @entity1 settled down with his children in his home in @entity4 to watch play - off hockey on television , a ritual repeated in millions of households across @entity9			1
but as he watched the presenters running through the news of the day , he suddenly saw something in the background that had probably gone unnoticed to most			0
" i take an odd pride in this , but i knew i had made it when i watched tv and sure enough behind the guys there 's a @entity21 console , " @entity1 said			1
" i hit pause on the dvr and asked my son , ' see that thing in the middle ? that 's our software			0
that 's what dad does			0
' " the console @entity1 had spotted will be familiar to almost anyone who has looked at a news website in the past couple of years			1
as the thirst for instant news has grown ever more insatiable , the " live blog " a time - stamped , regularly - updated , predominantly text - based report of breaking stories has become a staple of internet news and sport coverage			1
@entity21 , which @entity1 developed in 2007 , is the most commonly used live - blogging platform , and is regularly embedded on the websites of outlets as disparate as the @entity48 and @entity49 ; the @entity50 and @entity51 -- as well , it seemed , as in the @entity54 studios			1
more than 600 live - blogging " events " take place on @entity21 every day , attracting unique readerships that , according to @entity1 , can run as high as 14 million per event -- a record currently shared by coverage of president @entity62 's @entity61 speech , and a cricket test match in @entity64			1
reports have claimed @entity21 events attract 82 million visitors per month			1
the console can be managed by a single journalist and refreshes instantly with new content , which can include pictures , videos or @entity75 feeds , as well as the reporter 's text commentary			2
readers can interact through a comments box , vote in polls or enter trivia quizzes			0
the combined package of news and interactivity lends itself especially well to sport coverage , where it can mimic the experience of watching a match and discussing it with friends			0
but in recent years , live - blogging has also become the default approach to covering much harder breaking news stories : the uprisings of the @entity94 spring , the phone - hacking scandal in the @entity96 and the @entity98 shootings , for example , were all covered in live blogs on almost all major news platforms			1
the duration of events can make live - blogs especially " sticky " , encouraging readers to stay on a single page for longer than they ordinarily might			1
if a news story continues to develop throughout an entire day , the live - blog can become the one - stop shop for breaking developments alongside a digest of what has happened so far			2
it can later become an archive of how events unfolded in real time			0
" the core figure to us is the number of readers times the duration they spend on the software , " @entity1 said , stressing the multiplication			1
" something like the @entity125 trial in the @entity126 ( which was live - blogged in its entirety ) , was on from nine in the morning to four in the afternoon			0
it 's infinitely better from a business point of view than a really great event that 's only on for 35 minutes			0
" an average visitor to a @entity21 event stays for 12 minutes , according to @entity1			1
the live - blogging phenomenon actually pre-dates @entity21 by several years , and probably has its roots among the team of sports obsessives of @entity137 , who first provided ball - by - ball coverage of cricket matches in the mid- 1990s			1
both the @entity48 and the website of the @entity143 newspaper in the @entity96 soon picked up the baton , and the @entity143 in particular cultivated a unique tone and community among its sportswriters and readers , who pore over every minute of a football match or cricket games in over-by - over mini-reports			0
what not to blog but for all the recent proliferation of live blogs , some media analysts say that rolling coverage is not always appropriate , pointing to some notable lapses in editorial judgment			1
in 2008 , for example , the @entity159 was widely criticized when one of its reporters live blogged , via @entity75 , the funeral of a local toddler , who had been killed in an accident			0
updates from the stream included " family members shovel earth into grave " and " people are again sobbing "			0
this month the @entity48 website also attracted criticism for its somewhat oxymoronic coverage of " @entity177 death -- live ! " @entity178 , a former online sport editor at the @entity143 , who has contributed live online commentary since 1998 , said : " it kind of makes sense to do something like the phone - hacking scandal on a rolling blog , because on the first few days , something was happening every half an hour			1
but @entity177 , it just does n't make any sense			2
that 's just a news story : someone has died			2
" by definition , live blogs demand frequent updates , and thus reporters are often encouraged to substitute instant snaps for more considered journalistic analysis , or even silence			1
" it 's like 24 - hour news on tv , " said @entity178			2
" you always have to have something to fill it			0
that 's when you 're going to get all this hot air and speculation			0
" @entity1 agrees that the true strength of live blogging relies on the skills of the reporter to offer relevant analysis , publish pictures and launch appropriate poll questions			1
" our business is n't magical , " he said			0
" it really is dependent on the person running the event			0
if all you 're doing is regurgitating what they see on the tv screen anyway , there really is no point for them to be there			0
" the continued success of live - blogging seems certain , however			2
@entity21 was acquired by @entity231 in february and several alternative , similar platforms have also recently launched			2
@entity1 said that the business is working with news organizations to improve @entity21 's compatibility and to offer better tools for journalists			1
meanwhile consumers continue to make live - blogs the best read articles on most news sites			2
" people like immediacy , " said @entity178			0
" and i guess it means more people are getting interested in news , politics , sport , whatever , because there are new ways to consume it all			0

live blogging of events , from news to sports , has become *widespread*
@entity21 created by @entity1 in 2007 is most *popular* console to use
live blogs are attractive as they are seen as ' sticky ' to readers
some question how appropriate blogging can be for some stories , such as @entity177 's death
