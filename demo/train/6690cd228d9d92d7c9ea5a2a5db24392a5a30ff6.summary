-- more than a decade after his execution , @entity1 is still a pawn in the debate over the death penalty			1
opponents of capital punishment say @entity1 's is a clear case of an inmate being wrongfully executed , while the original prosecutor and state of @entity12 have been steadfast in their assertion that @entity1 should be no one 's cause @entity16 Â¨ bre			1
" @entity1 was a psychopathic killer who murdered his three children , " @entity17 , the former @entity18 prosecutor who handled the case in 1992 , wrote in an e-mail			1
" he submitted to a polygraph with predictable results , he confessed the murders to his wife , the trial evidence established two prior incidents when he tried to kill his children in utero by vicious attacks on his wife			2
" @entity1 was executed in february 2004 after being found guilty in an arson that killed his children , 2 - year - old @entity34 and 1 - year - old twins @entity36 and @entity37			1
his family has fought to have his name cleared ever since			0
the @entity40 filed a grievance monday with the @entity42 , asking that it investigate the now - retired prosecutor			1
the grievance alleges @entity17 " fabricated and concealed evidence , " including documents indicating that a jailhouse informant received special treatment in exchange for his testimony , which @entity17 and the informant both claimed was not true during the original trial			1
a story in the @entity55 on sunday , written by the @entity56 , a journalistic group focusing on criminal justice matters , said @entity1 's case is especially important to death penalty opponents because it could provide the first case showing " conclusively that an innocent man was put to death in the modern era of capital punishment			1
" the story points out that @entity69 justice @entity68 , in upholding @entity67 ' death penalty in 2006 , said opponents had failed to show a single case in which a convict was executed for a crime she or he did n't commit			1
evidence and testimony at trial showed that @entity1 had been involved in criminal activity since his teens and had been verbally and physically abusive with his family			1
witnesses alleged that during the blaze , @entity1 seemed more concerned with rescuing his car than his daughters			1
appellate courts , including the @entity69 , declined to stop @entity1 's execution , yet in his final words , he claimed to be " an innocent man convicted of a crime i did not commit			1
" since his conviction , the science employed by investigators to determine that the fatal fire was an arson , as well as a post-conviction claim by his ex-wife , @entity94 , that @entity1 confessed to her , have been matters of debate			1
an alleged alliance the @entity56 story reports that informant @entity100 , whose testimony was integral to convicting @entity1 , now says he lied on the witness stand in exchange for favors from @entity17			1
the story also alleges that correspondence between @entity17 and @entity100 indicate the two were in cahoots			0
@entity17 told @entity0 the letters are being misconstrued			0
in one letter , @entity100 writes that his testimony against @entity1 resulted in retaliation from other inmates			1
" here , the state offered me certain benefits in exchange for my testimony , which resulted in sending a man to death row			1
this resulted in a murder contract being placed on my head			0
because i kept my end of the promise , the state is bound to uphold theirs until my release from incarceration , " @entity100 wrote to @entity17 in 1996			0
other documents cited in the @entity56 report indicate @entity17 worked to have the charges on which @entity100 was convicted reduced , to have @entity100 released early on a robbery conviction and to have him moved to a less dangerous prison			0
in a 1996 letter to a @entity135 official , @entity17 wrote that @entity100 should be afforded an " out - of - sequence parole hearing " based on his cooperation in the @entity139 case and the subsequent threats against him			2
@entity17 wrote in closing that incarceration would not aid @entity100 's rehabilitation and would jeopardize the @entity1 conviction			1
thus , " @entity100 's cooperation in the murder prosecution without expectation of leniency should be accorded some consideration , " he said			0
@entity100 was granted parole in 1998 , but within months was back in jail on drug charges , which constituted a parole violation			0
in 2000 , @entity100 said in a handwritten letter that he wished to recant his testimony			0
the @entity56 alleges the note was never placed in @entity100 's file or disclosed to @entity1 's attorneys			2
" i am given no other choice but to make this motion to recant testimony at this time , " @entity100 wrote			0
" i was forced to testify against mr. @entity1 by the @entity162 's office and other officials			2
i was made to lie			0
mr. @entity1 is innocent of all charges			2
" ' patently untrue ' reached at his @entity166 , @entity12 , office , @entity17 declined a chance to present his side of the allegations in a phone interview			0
despite @entity0 messages left via phone and e-mail , he said he was " skeptical @entity0 wants to present my side of the story			0
" @entity0 was n't given a chance to ask @entity17 specific questions about the allegations -- namely , reports that numerous fire investigators now say the original conviction was based on outdated arson science and a @entity56 allegation that a wealthy businessman with connections to @entity17 provided @entity100 money and favors			0
@entity17 did , however , provide a 250 - word response to some of the allegations against him			0
" the new tack is that i promised the jailhouse witness @entity100 leniency if he would testify that @entity1 confessed , " @entity17 wrote			1
" this is patently untrue and i interviewed @entity100 before others and very sincerely advised him that i could offer him nothing in return for his testimony			0
" after " supposedly reputable journalists , " whom @entity17 did n't name , outed @entity100 as a snitch who had cooperated with authorities , the white supremacist gang , the @entity197 , began threatening @entity100			0
there were also efforts by @entity1 's defense team and prison guards colluding with the @entity197 to coerce @entity100 to recant , and a journalist even tried to bribe the informant , @entity17 wrote			1
" after ( emphasis @entity17 's ) the @entity1 trial i did everything in my power to prevent his being killed by the ( @entity197 ) , " he said			2
" @entity100 wrote letters warning that he would be forced to write a recantation because of death threats from the ( @entity197 ) and their stooge prison guard , but that the recantation would be false			0
" @entity17 also alluded in his e-mail to @entity1 's ex-wife 's claim that @entity1 confessed to her before his execution			2
indeed , in 2010 , responding to the @entity1 family 's push to have her former husband 's name cleared , @entity94 told reporters gathered at an @entity228 courthouse that @entity1 admitted setting the blaze			2
" @entity230 murdered @entity34 , @entity36 and @entity37			0
he burnt them , " she said			0
" he admitted he burnt them to me , and he was convicted for his crime			0
that is the closest to justice that my daughters will ever get			0
" she would later tell the @entity238 and @entity240 magazine that @entity1 made no such confession to her , according to their reports			2
arson or no arson ... in his e-mail to @entity0 , @entity17 did not address the arson science used in the investigation , but he wrote in a 2009 guest column for the @entity250 that there was sufficient evidence of @entity1 's guilt without the problematic findings in the arson report			2
" the @entity1 trial has become a sort of cause celebre by anti-death penalty proponents because it seems to be an example of outmoded scientific techniques which led to a miscarriage of justice , " he said			1
" in fact , the trial testimony ( the newspaper ) reported in 1991 contains overwhelming evidence of guilt completely independent of the undeniably flawed forensic report			0
" he pointed to seven factors that he said helped establish @entity1 's guilt , including his violent past , evidence showing someone had blocked the door 's back home with a refrigerator , the " superficial " nature of @entity1 's burns and an analysis suggesting @entity1 had n't inhaled excessive smoke , as he claimed , during his rescue attempt			2
@entity282 seems certain in @entity1 's case , outside the fact that death penalty opponents and proponents staunchly disagree over his guilt			1
disagreement has been a mark of the case , as @entity1 's own defense attorney told @entity0 in 2009 that he thought his client was guilty , while one of the jurors who convicted him expressed doubts			1
@entity12 gov. @entity296 has defended his decision not to stay @entity1 's execution , calling him a " monster			2
" meanwhile , @entity40 co-director @entity300 said in the monday news release that not only should the verdict be called into question , but so should the man who prosecuted @entity1			1
" we are asking the @entity42 to investigate and prosecute this matter , which we believe is of profound importance to all citizens in this country			0
whether one supports or opposes the death penalty , the execution of an innocent man is , as @entity315 ( @entity314 has said , a ' constitutionally intolerable event , ' " @entity300 said			1
@entity17 has seen his case under fire before , and he stands by the verdict today , just as he did when it was handed down in 1992 and when he penned his guest commentary for the local paper in 2009			2
" while anti-death - penalty advocates can muster some remarkably good arguments , @entity1 should not be anyone 's poster child , " he wrote then			1
@entity0 's @entity327 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 was executed in 2004 for killing his 3 children
