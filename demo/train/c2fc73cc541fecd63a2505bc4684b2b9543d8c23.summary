has grounded all @entity5 - registered @entity4 's for safety checks to assess whether they meet the agency 's standards			1
the checks affect aircraft in the fleets of @entity13 , the airline at the heart of wednesday 's fatal incident , and @entity17 , another local carrier			1
@entity13 operates six @entity18 and four @entity19 including the @entity4 72 - 600 which crashed wednesday			1
@entity20 has 12 atr 72 - 600s			2
@entity22 , president of @entity13 , told journalists that the airline was complying with the temporary halt of the company 's @entity4 fleet			1
" the airline , as requested from the @entity0 , is specifically checking all @entity4 aircraft in the fleet			1
they have not finished checking one until this morning , " he said			0
" once we have one finished , @entity0 will confirm the results before we start flying that aircraft again			2
" the @entity0 has also prohibited @entity13 from applying for new traffic rights for a year , according to @entity5 state news agency @entity37			1
the plane , which reportedly flew three times on wednesday , appears to have suffered a " flameout " -- an engine failure -- shortly after takeoff			0
" it appears that it could have had a single - engine flameout , it could have had a dual - engine flameout , " former @entity4 pilot @entity46 told @entity1 's " @entity47 with @entity48			1
" " those are things we 're going to learn			0
" it is the second fatal @entity13 incident involving an @entity4 in less than a year -- although the plane that crashed in july while attempting to land on @entity53 , was a @entity4 72 - 500 -- an older model			1
in its 20 - year history , the airline has lost five aircraft , and encountered seven " significant safety incidents , " @entity55 , @entity56 managing editor of @entity57 , an industry publication , wrote in an analysis piece			2
along with wednesday 's fatal crash , @entity13 planes have been involved in four incidents involving loss of life -- two of which affected only crew , two of which also saw passengers perish			1
the planes , which are constructed by a @entity78 consortium , have suffered crashes before			0
@entity4 's , as well as the company 's similar , but smaller @entity82 designation , have previously been involved in a number of incidents			1
no fewer than 11 incidents resulting in passenger deaths involving @entity4 turboprops have been recorded around the world , including @entity13 's recent crashes			1
during a domestic @entity91 flight from @entity92 to @entity93 , an @entity94 atr 72 - 200 crashed near @entity95 , @entity96 , in 1994 following icing on its wings			0
all four crew and 64 passengers died			0
an account , " @entity102 , a former @entity104 pilot , is credited in having a role in the subsequent @entity107 - ordered grounding of all @entity4 aircraft			1
the account alleges that the model had " a history of performance problems in icing conditions			0
" however , @entity113 , former pilot and principal of @entity115 , a consultancy for airlines and aviation authorities , says that amongst his peers , @entity4 planes have a good reputation			1
" ( the @entity4 ) is actually a very good aircraft -- it 's been around for a while , " he says			2
" it 's used extensively in regional services , including by @entity125 in @entity126			0
generally speaking it 's a good aircraft			2
" it does n't have reputation as a difficult plane to fly			0
i know one guy who has flown them in @entity133 and @entity126 who thinks it 's a great aircraft			0
i ca n't speak to them being dangerous			0
" indeed , the @entity4 's cost - efficiency has made it a popular choice for airlines , particularly those in the low - cost sector , and on less - popular routes which typically ferry fewer passengers			1
" the @entity4 is the workhorse of the @entity147 turboprop fleet			2
it is popular among airlines for its relatively low operational costs , particularly in a high - fuel - cost environment , and the type has a dominant market share , " @entity57 's @entity148 told @entity1			2
however , he would not speculate whether the latest episode would affect the model 's continued popularity			0
" it 's far too early to say exactly what happened to @entity161			0
the flight will be the subject of a lengthy investigation that will look at factors such as cockpit communications and the aircraft 's performance			0

@entity5 @entity0 ( @entity170 ) has ordered all @entity5 - registered @entity4 's grounded until safety checks can be made
wednesday 's fatal *accident* the second fatal @entity13 incident involving an @entity4 in less than a year
despite several fatal *accident*s over its time in service , the " workhorse " has good reputation among pilots
