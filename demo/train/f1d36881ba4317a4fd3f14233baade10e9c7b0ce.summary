-- we hear a lot about children with autism			1
but adults on the spectrum face their own set of challenges			2
one of the big ones ? finding and getting a job that fits their unique talents and temperaments			1
@entity0 recently profiled @entity14 still , a woman with @entity17 's syndrome ( a high - functioning variant of autism ) who has had a tough time finding the right career environment			1
her story seemed to bring up as many questions as it answered , so we enlisted her , along with a couple of experts , to address them in a live @entity30 chat			1
joining still in the chat were @entity32 of @entity33 , who has worked with and managed employees with autism as well as having a son with @entity17 's , and @entity37 of @entity38 , which provides job training for those with disabilities and other barriers			1
you can read the full transcript of the chat on @entity30 , or scan through the highlights below to find out how people with autism can confront the challenges they face when finding a job			1
some responses have been edited for clarity			0
what is the no. 1 challenge you see with those on the spectrum trying to find employment ? @entity59 : the no. 1 challenge our agency faces when trying put someone with a disability to work is either lack of work experience or a gap in employment			1
with the job market being so competitive , it is difficult to sell people as the most qualified and capable when the work history does not reflect this			1
this is why our agency focuses on giving people that we serve an advantage over others by training them to be excellent employees to match local employers ' needs			1
still : the no. 1 challenge would be to find places that are not invading all the senses at one time : too many people , bright fluorescent lights and sudden chaotic noises , where there is no room to breathe and be yourself			1
many ( people with autism ) are extremely sensitive and it gets to us much more than regular people			1
for me sudden and loud abrasive people and places really do not sit well			1
i have to leave really fast when it gets too overwhelming			0
i have to go be by myself and cover my ears often			0
what do you wish employers knew about those with autism and @entity17 's ? @entity32 : people with autism have unique talents and they can be some of your best employees			1
they do n't need to be micro-managed or get special treatment			0
simply give them a challenge , the support that they need and then get out of the way			0
@entity59 : employers need to be flexible when working with people with all disabilities			1
most of the time , it is not as important how something is done as that it is done safely and correctly within the set time frame			0
our focus is to make sure that someone is equal and not " special " in the workplace			0
sometimes this takes some accommodations , but people with disabilities should be expected to be able to perform the essential functions of the job			1
i hired someone with @entity17 's -- now what ? are there careers that @entity17 excel in more than others ? @entity32 : one of the most important things is to pick the right career			1
sales and marketing may be a bigger challenge because those fields need people who are more socially adept , but mathematicians and engineers need a gift for logic and reason			1
just help them pick a field that is better suited for people on the spectrum			2
is there a list of " disability - friendly " employers ? @entity59 : usually agencies like mine develop those regionally			0
it 's all about relationships and supportive employers			0
there are some that are large national chains and some are mom and pop operations			0
we try to focus on finding a job for each person based on what they would like to do rather than trying to fit people into certain jobs / employers			2
as a person with autism , would it be safe to tell employers during the interview that you have autism ? @entity32 : i would wait to tell your employer			1
every employee is unique and has strengths and weaknesses			2
during the interview process , focus on your strengths and what it is you can offer your employer			0
once you land that job , build up trust with your manager , and then if you feel comfortable with sharing that you have autism , do so , but be prepared to help them understand what it means to have autism , including the opportunities			2
i have @entity17 's and i 'm just like you it 's hard enough to get a job , and @entity17 's does sometimes get in the way			0
any advice on how to get jobs ? @entity32 : there is no question that finding a job can be a challenge for any of us			1
for those with @entity17 's , my advice is that a little interview coaching can go a long way			0
one of the key things employers look for is someone that is a cultural fit to the company and team			0
it 's a hard process for everyone involved in the interviewing process			0
an interview coach can help with how to answer questions and present the best you that you can be			0
check with your local university or community college : schools often host interviewing workshops for the public , and you do n't need to be a student or a graduate			2
what can parents of those on the spectrum do to help prep their children for the workplace ? @entity59 : it is important for parents to realize that autism does not make it impossible to work , by any means			2
it may mean that someone will need a specific environment that fits their needs			2
it is also important for everyone to realize that employers ( as well as the general public ) will eventually expect someone with any disability to be able to function in the world			0
i think it is very natural for parents to want to protect or shield their child from anything unpleasant or uncomfortable , but it will be something that will happen eventually			0
having expectations of responsibility , chores , school work , etc. is important for any child to transition from school to work			0
@entity32 : one of the most important things is to help your child pick the right career			1
spend time exploring different careers			0
mathematics , computer science , graphic design are all great options for people on the spectrum			2
my brother always says i need to get my son into the best business school i can because of how he loves to organize things			0
growing up autistic have you found it important to speak out publicly on workplace issues ? @entity32 : yes , i feel that it has been very important to speak up			1
people can make harsh and often incorrect judgments about those on the autistic spectrum			2
if we , who understand the challenges of those living on the spectrum , do n't speak up now , then the day may come where we wish we had , but ca n't			0
@entity59 : i find it 's important to show success stories about people on the autism spectrum going to work and successfully keeping a job			1
if nothing else , it gives people hope .			2
