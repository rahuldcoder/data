-- @entity1 could be forgiven for exuding an air of misty - eyed contentment as he sits among his own motorsport memorabilia at @entity6 's @entity5			1
visitors have been poring over the @entity9 's silverware , cars and kit ever since the exhibition celebrating his near 30 - year career opened last december			1
but he insists now is not the time for reminiscing			0
" if you ask me this question in 10 years ' time i will tell you less , because two championships are more than i could dream , " the @entity17 driver told @entity0			2
" if you ask me right now and i am in a middle of a competition , i am hungry for victories ; hungry for success -- i will tell you that two championships are not enough			0
" since winning his second world @entity27 for @entity29 in 2006 , @entity1 has endured a frustrating time on the track			2
a three - year deal with @entity33 ended prematurely after one season following a souring of relations with team boss @entity37 and his driving partner @entity38			1
a return to @entity29 in 2008 saw him slip from third place to fifth in the drivers ' championship -- a season that will be forever remembered for the so - called " @entity46 " affair -- and a year later @entity1 registered just one podium and finished ninth overall in his worst showing since debuting for @entity50 in 2001			1
the switch to @entity52 in 2010 has been more productive , yielding 11 grand prix wins and 31 podiums in 77 starts			0
but a third world title has remained just out of reach -- the 32 - year - old has finished second to @entity60 's @entity59 in three of the past four seasons			1
but it 's anyone 's guess what might happen this year , with all teams and drivers grappling with a new car following a complete overhaul of @entity52 's technical regulations			1
with the first pre-season testing session now complete , @entity52 have learned much about their new - look @entity71 @entity1 finished second fastest on the final day in @entity72 , @entity73 and completed the second most number of laps overall			1
by contrast , reigning champions @entity60 managed just 20 laps over all four days			0
" these were four very demanding and important days to give us something to work on over the coming days in @entity83 , " team principal @entity78 told @entity52 's official website			1
" the important thing is to do as many laps as possible to give our engineers the data they need to continue with the development of the car			0
it would be premature to make any precise evaluations , " he added			0
@entity1 agrees saying it 's too early to judge how the @entity96 team might fair this season			2
" we are discovering every day new things about the car and new possibilities , so i think the potential is there , " he said			0
" the car has some good signs and , let 's say , the philosophy that the car has been designed is just what we are seeing now on the data			1
so there is nothing wrong , nothing to be pessimistic about , but a lot of work to do			0
" lower noses , raised eyebrows along with smaller engines -- 1.6 - liter @entity118 turbos replace 2.4 - liter @entity120 -- come smaller fuel tanks ( 100 kilos compared to around 150 last year ) and a range of chassis alterations			2
the most obvious of these changes has been the lower nose cone , which is now a maximum height of 185 millimeters compared to last season 's 550 millimeters			0
@entity1 concedes it 's a bit of cosmetic surgery that all teams have struggled with aesthetically			1
" they are ugly , yeah			0
we have to be honest with that , you know , with our fans and ourselves first of all			0
" so probably we will get used to these new aesthetics , let 's say , but the first moment they are not good enough because people look at @entity17 like excellence of motor sport , of aerodynamics , excellence of performance and technology -- and when you see those front part of the car , it does n't look like all the things we 've been saying			0
" so i think we will find different solutions			0
i 'm sure the engineers are clever enough to make the car fast and also beautiful			0
" @entity156 - ished business @entity1 will also be forging a new partnership with new teammate @entity158 this season			1
the flying @entity160 , who won his only world title driving for @entity52 in 2007 , makes up one half of the most interesting @entity17 pairings in recent times , and one which will test both men 's skills on the track and their powers of diplomacy off it			2
" i think he 's very talented so that is a huge help and a huge motivation for myself first and also for the team , because the team knows it has to deliver a good car because @entity158 will deliver a good result , " @entity1 said			1
" i know i need to deliver my best , if not i can not be in front of @entity158 , so that is only good and positive news for @entity52			1
" positive news for @entity52 , and everyone involved in @entity183 , would be any improvement in the condition of @entity186			1
the @entity188 's agent @entity187 announced last week that the 45 - year - old , who has been in a medically - induced coma for over a month , was having his sedation reduced to start the " waking - up process			1
" @entity186 , who won five of his seven world titles with @entity52 , suffered severe head trauma in a skiing accident at the @entity197 on december 29			1
" i think we are ( all ) still in shock , after nearly one month , " @entity1 said			0
" the day that i received the news i could not believe it , to be honest , because he is not a man that you think will have any problem			0
" he was the man that can beat anything and can win any race and can do anything without any worries , so to see him and to see the accident ... " we are all hoping every day to have some good news coming from the hospital ... all ( the ) drivers have huge respect because he was the man that motivated us and he was the man who we were looking at when we were go - kart drivers			2
" @entity1 's quest for a third drivers ' championship title begins in @entity221 on march 16			2

@entity183 world champion talks to @entity0 about 2014 season , tech changes and @entity186
@entity9 says @entity52 's new @entity230 is showing " some good signs " but there is " a lot of work to do "
the 32 - year - old will race *alongside* @entity158 at @entity52 this season
@entity1 concedes new noses are " ugly " and that cars need to be " fast and beautiful "
