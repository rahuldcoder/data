@entity1 is back to its old ways , it seems			2
@entity4 's military has reported that its reclusive northern neighbor test - fired two medium - range ballistic missiles wednesday morning from a site north of @entity8 into the sea off its east coast			1
the military posturing came while the @entity4 's leader , @entity12 , met with @entity14 prime minister @entity13 and @entity16 president @entity15 on the sidelines of the @entity18 in the @entity19			1
@entity20 @entity4 news agency @entity21 reported the three leaders urged tripartite cooperation in the face of @entity1 antagonism			1
" i think it 's very important for our three nations to display this kind of unity and shared determination , " president @entity15 said following the talks			0
@entity14 has registered a " strong protest " with the @entity1 embassy in @entity35 , minister for foreign affairs @entity36 told a parliamentary session wednesday			0
but he said the launch would not affect @entity14 - @entity1 talks scheduled for march 30			2
" it is a very important opportunity to make a strong approach to @entity1 , " he said			0
" @entity14 is not considering the change of the plan as of now			0
" it is believed that two medium - range @entity48 missiles -- one at 2.35 am ( local time ) and again a few minutes later -- were launched , eventually splashing down in the @entity52 , also known by the @entity53 as the @entity54			0
several launches of short - range ballistics have been conducted in recent weeks , including one that came within minutes of potentially hitting a @entity60 passenger jet			0
it does not appear that @entity1 issued any warnings ahead of wednesday 's launches			2
if confirmed , this latest launch marks the first time since 2009 that the @entity1 has fired the @entity48 class of missile			1
" it is a clear violation of @entity71 resolution and we demand an immediate stop to ( the ) provocation , " @entity4 @entity75 spokesperson @entity68 - fyi said			2
@entity68 added that there are no signs to suggest further launch plans			0
@entity1 launches 30 short - range rockets into the sea sending a message the @entity75 in @entity82 believes the launch was a reaction to ongoing @entity16 - @entity4 military drills as well as a " message to the international community , " given the timing with regards to the @entity91 summit			1
" these march 26 launches of medium - range @entity48 ( also known as @entity48 ) ballistic missiles represent a troubling and provocative escalation that the @entity16 takes very ( seriously ) , " @entity93 deputy spokesperson @entity92 said			2
" we are closely coordinating with our allies and partners , including in the @entity101 , to take the appropriate measures in response to this latest provocation and to address the threat to global security posed by the @entity1 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs			1
" there are a number of @entity71 resolutions restricting ballistic missile launches , including several specifically requiring @entity1 to " suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile program and to re-establish a moratorium on missile launches			1
" @entity60 reaction while there has been no official reaction from @entity35 , @entity1 's recent saber - rattling is not going to help relations with @entity60 , one of the stalinist state 's few international allies , said @entity126 , assistant professor of @entity127 at @entity128 in @entity82			1
" there has n't been any fundamental policy shift but we 've seen high ranking @entity60 officials express their annoyance pretty consistently , " he told @entity129			0
" i think ( president ) @entity135 ( @entity136 ) is getting an impression of @entity138 as someone who keeps stirring the pot in ways that are detrimental and undercut the ways which @entity35 wants to move			0
this is not going to improve relations between @entity1 and @entity60			0
" the bellicose move comes at a time when @entity1 finds itself increasingly isolated , blaming the @entity16 for the breakdown of the six - party talks , and , according to @entity4 's conservative @entity150 newspaper , even urging its military and officials " not to trust " @entity60			1
indeed , tensions involving @entity1 and its neighbors are rarely out of the headlines			2
the @entity1 state news agency @entity156 accused @entity4 authorities of " hurting the dignity " of @entity1 's " supreme leadership " by dropping propaganda leaflets on five @entity1 islands			1
