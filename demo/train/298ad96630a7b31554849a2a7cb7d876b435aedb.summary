@entity0 has reopened a can of worms @entity2 probably would have just as soon kept sealed			1
in addition to a speech by @entity5 , a frequent @entity2 co-star , a @entity7 tribute sunday night featured a short film of @entity2 's greatest hits			1
but the film was missing one thing , tweeted @entity0			1
" missed the @entity2 tribute , " he wrote , " did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after @entity18 ? " @entity0 disses @entity2 's @entity7 tribute ( @entity2 was n't at the @entity7 ; he 's known for avoiding awards shows , for many years skipping the @entity21 to keep a regular musical gig at a @entity24 jazz club			1
) the tweet once again exposes one of the darkest episodes of @entity2 's life -- one that had seemingly vanished from the headlines in recent years , as the filmmaker 's career has been revitalized by a series of well - reviewed , award - winning films , including " @entity35 " and " midnight in @entity36			1
" in 1992 , in the wake of an affair between @entity2 and soon - @entity39 -- @entity0 's adopted daughter with composer @entity41 -- the filmmaker was accused by @entity0 of molesting their young daughter @entity44			1
a court found the accusations inconclusive , but the scandal permanently damaged @entity2 's image -- that of a neurotic , but amusing schlub with a talent for slapstick and witty one - liners			1
legacy of a scandal indeed , until the scandal hit , @entity2 was generally received warmly by the general public , even if his @entity24 - centric , sometimes thorny comedies appealed only to a fairly narrow audience			1
( as a seemingly autobiographical line in 1980 's " @entity62 " pointed out , the public tended to like his " earlier , funnier movies			0
" ) he was easily caricatured -- not least by himself , since he always maintained his screen persona was just that , a persona -- and was even the subject of a comic strip for several years			0
@entity2 responded to the scandal by denying the @entity44 accusations and saying that his relationship with @entity72 , which had been painted in storybook colors by the press , was not actually all that strong			1
as usual , he immersed himself in his work , maintaining his movie - per - year schedule and generally avoiding the limelight			1
some of his mid- ' 90s movies , notably " @entity79 " and " celebrity , " were unpleasantly acidic views of public life			0
he did marry soon - @entity39 in 1997 , and after the marriage came a slightly more public @entity2			2
the couple was the focus of a 1997 @entity87 documentary , " @entity89 , " which portrayed a generally happy pair			0
@entity2 was also the subject of a 2011 @entity92 film , " @entity2 : a documentary , " which briskly addressed @entity0 's allegations from @entity2 's point of view			1
however , the scandal has always been near the surface , and this is the second time in recent months that it 's made a forthright appearance			2
in a november @entity101 article , @entity2 was condemned by @entity72 's children , especially @entity44 , who has since changed her name			1
" i 'm scared of him , his image , " @entity44 told writer @entity104			0
another child , @entity107 , told @entity108 he had removed @entity2 's image from both family photos and videos			1
@entity0 's point and sunday 's tweet is n't the first time @entity0 has aimed a poison pixel at @entity2			1
" happy father 's day -- or as they call it in my family , happy brother - in - law 's day , " he tweeted last june , referring to the soon - @entity39 affair			2
but publicist @entity121 , vice-chair of @entity122 , does n't think @entity2 will be hurt			2
" i do n't think we can expect a lot of traction on this thing , " he said			0
" if this was a guy who was spending a lot of time getting press for himself , it might bite him in the ass			0
but he 's not investing his time in ( publicity ) -- he 's a filmmaker			0
" @entity0 also comes out ahead			2
he recently signed a deal with @entity137 for a talk show , so the publicity will keep his name in the headlines , said @entity121			0
" he 's clearly his mother 's son -- she 's made her point of view known on this -- and he 's also got a new forum in terms of a tv show , so this does him good in terms of attention , " he said			0
@entity2 generally does n't comment to the press , but in a 1992 " @entity153 " interview , he said that allegations he abused @entity44 were " insane			1
" @entity2 's lawyer @entity155 said in the november @entity101 article that @entity2 still denies the allegations			1
an e-mail to @entity2 's representative requesting comment on recent events was n't immediately returned on monday			1
a forgiving town @entity162 is a forgiving town -- even for a defiantly un-hollywood type like @entity2			2
@entity164 , who fled to @entity165 in 1977 after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a minor , won a best director @entity21 for 2002 's " the @entity169			0
" in 1951 , producer @entity170 shot and wounded his wife 's agent , believing an affair was going on ; he served four months and went back to producing , including " @entity174			2
" countless other stars have engaged in sordid behavior and paid no price worse than public disapproval			0
for their supporters , it 's the art , not the artist			0
" it 's a complicated question , made even more so by the idiosyncratic relationship between each artist 's body of work and personality , " wrote @entity182 in @entity183			2
@entity2 has maintained the art wins out			2
" all the success over it or the rejection , none of that really matters because in the end , the thing will survive or not survive on its merits , " said @entity191 in her speech , quoting @entity2			2
still , for @entity2 , known for his jokes and aphorisms -- " i do n't want to achieve immortality through my work			1
i want to achieve it through not dying , " goes one of the best known -- it 's perhaps ironic that one particular quotation attached to the scandal may end up the squirmy centerpiece of his biography			0
interviewed by @entity213 in 1992 about the soon - @entity39 affair , he leaned ( perhaps unawares ) on an @entity216 line			0
" the heart , " he said , " wants what it wants			0
" but even more striking , given the filmmaker 's lack of concern for public opinion , is the original line , which is taken from an 1862 @entity216 letter			0
" the heart wants what it wants , " @entity216 wrote			0
" or else it does not care			0

@entity0 tweet during @entity7 brings up @entity2 scandal
in early ' 90s , @entity2 had affair with @entity72 's daughter
@entity2 has generally stuck to his work and ignored *criticism*
