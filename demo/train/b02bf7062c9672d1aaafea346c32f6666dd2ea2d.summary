-- by friday , more than 70 million people had viewed " @entity2 " or clips of it			1
@entity4 was trending on @entity5 and the blogosphere teemed with attacks and defenses of @entity9 , the @entity10 - based nonprofit group that produced the half - hour documentary about the notorious @entity4 warlord			1
invisible children aimed to make @entity14 a household name and drum up global support to end the murders , rapes , abuses and abductions committed by the @entity21			0
but with the popularity of the video and kudos to the filmmakers for raising awareness of an @entity28 tragedy came a flurry of questions about @entity9 's intentions , its transparency and whether the social media frenzy was too little , too late			1
" it is the right message but it 's 15 years too late , " said col. @entity34 , a @entity4 military spokesman			1
" if people cared 15 years ago , then thousands of lives would have been saved and thousands of children would have stayed at home and not been kidnapped			1
" @entity40 , who was abducted by the @entity21 in 2001 and spent three harrowing years in captivity , said @entity14 needs to face justice and she hoped the documentary would help make that happen			2
but she worried that a military campaign against @entity14 might bring more injury to children who have suffered enough and that government forces need to adopt strict policies to ensure the safety of the abducted children			1
@entity40 was severely disfigured in a military bombing targeting the @entity21			2
" it hurts a lot of young innocent kids , " she said			0
" they do n't know how to protect themselves			0
" now a fellow for @entity59 , an international organization that provides opportunities for young people who have survived conflict , @entity40 said the crisis goes beyond @entity14			2
" they should open their eyes more on the people affected by the war , " she said			2
" and the children -- they need to find a way to protect them			0
they have no hope , no way to escape			0
" @entity14 has unleashed his fury in eastern @entity28 for two decades and is wanted for crimes against humanity by the @entity78			0
last october , the @entity79 sent 100 combat - equipped troops on a mission to kill or capture @entity14			0
@entity9 says it wants @entity14 's name to become so familiar that it will pressure the @entity79 and other governments to stay on the chase			1
on april 20 , the group plans to paper cities with @entity14 posters			0
but the media attention on @entity14 may actually hamper efforts to catch @entity14 , said @entity90 of the @entity91			0
" all i can say is , it could n't have happened at a more unhelpful moment when you look at it strategically and operationally , " said @entity90 , a civilian adviser to the military command that sent the @entity79 troops			2
the film comes after a regional -- and covert -- military operation has been under way for several months			2
the attention could prompt @entity14 to go on the move again and seriously set back @entity28 and @entity79 efforts to catch @entity14 once and for all			0
the @entity21 terrorized @entity4 for years in a failed attempt to overthrow the government			1
but since 2006 , when it was pushed out of northern @entity4 , it has largely operated the @entity107 and @entity108			1
the @entity110 refugee agency said this week that 3,000 people were recently displaced after fresh @entity21 attacks in @entity107 's @entity113			2
the agency reported 20 new attacks since the start of the year , with one person killed and 17 abducted			0
the cultish rebel group stands accused of using vicious tactics to recruit and force thousands of children into taking up arms			0
there are reports of child soldiers brainwashed into killing their own parents			0
the film follows an alleged former @entity4 child soldier and calls for action against @entity14			1
but several observers are urging caution , saying that @entity9 has manipulated facts in the past and advised viewers to watch the documentary with that in mind			1
others warned that calling for military campaigns against @entity14 would only bring more harm to the @entity21 's victims			2
a student blog called " @entity142 " linked to a photograph of @entity9 's founders -- @entity145 , @entity146 , and @entity147 -- posing with hardcore weaponry with members of the @entity150 , who have battled the @entity21			1
" the group is in favor of direct military intervention , and their money supports the @entity4 government 's army and various other military forces , " the @entity142 blog post said			1
" both the @entity4 army and @entity150 are riddled with accusations of rape and looting , but @entity9 defends them			1
" bloggers debated the merit of arming one group to fight another and questioned why only about 30 % of @entity9 's budget was used to help children in @entity4			1
" we 're an unorthodox organization , " @entity147 told @entity0			0
" we work outside of the traditional box of what you think about charity and nonprofit			2
" he said a third of fund - raising dollars were spent on the film , another third on film - related advocacy and the rest on a mission to end the war and rehabilitate war - affected children			0
" so that 's our model , " he said			0
" that 's who we are			0
we are not these other organizations that do amazing work on the ground			0
if you want to fund a cow or you want to help someone in a village in that component , you can do that			0
that 's a third of what we do			0
" on its website , @entity9 said it spent 80.46 % on programs in 2011 ; 16.24 % on administration and management costs ; and 3.22 % on direct fundraising			1
invisible children spokeswoman @entity205 said any money generated from the film will go to @entity9 , which builds schools in @entity4			1
money will also go to support a high - frequency radio station that @entity9 operates , which broadcasts @entity212 messages to fighters urging them to defect			1
@entity0 is unable to immediately verify this information or any of @entity9 's activities in @entity28 nations			1
actress @entity217 , a goodwill ambassador for @entity218 who has visited @entity21 - attacked areas , commended invisible children for bringing " unprecedented focus " to a horrific situation but urged people to donate money to agencies like the @entity226 and @entity218 that work to help @entity21 victims			2
@entity4 government spokesman @entity228 said @entity9 's campaign reflected @entity28 as a dark continent of incessant trouble			1
" @entity9 , if it is using such images to dupe the international community into , into ensuring that they contribute financially into its works , i 'm afraid to say it is a wrong approach , " he said , " and indeed its activities in northern @entity4 will be further questioned , in as far as the amount of money they receive vis - a - vis the actual interventions that they make in northern @entity4 where he thinks he is concerned about			1
" " @entity2 " skyrocketed to popularity on @entity246 propelled by thousands of posts on @entity5 and @entity248 , especially by celebrities			1
invisible children sent @entity5 messages about the documentary to 20 celebrities , including @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 and @entity258			0
many of the tweets about the film appear to be from fans who follow those celebrities			0
" the celebrity strategy is simply , you have a voice , " @entity147 said			0
" some people have a larger voice than others			2
we 're not obsessed with celebrities			0
we 're not celebrities ourselves			0
that is what this is about			0
" over the past decade , @entity9 has been one of the most influential advocacy groups , putting pressure on the @entity278 and @entity279 administrations , imploring the @entity79 government to take a side in the fight between the @entity21 and the @entity4 government , according to a november 11 article in foreign affairs , a publication by the nonpartisan @entity287			1
it said @entity9 and other advocacy groups " have manipulated facts for strategic purposes , exaggerating the scale of @entity21 abductions and murders and emphasizing the @entity21 's use of innocent children as soldiers			1
" " they rarely refer to the @entity4 atrocities or those of @entity300 's @entity150 , such as attacks against civilians or looting of civilian homes and businesses , or the complicated regional politics fueling the conflict			1
" @entity9 addressed the criticisms on its website , saying it simplified a complex crisis			1
" @entity2 portrays , in no uncertain terms , the image of a madman who manipulates children spiritually for his own tactical gains , " it said			1
" in our quest to garner wide public support of nuanced policy , @entity9 has sought to explain the conflict in an easily understandable format , focusing on the core attributes of @entity21 leadership that infringe upon the most basic of human rights			2
in a 30 - minute film , however , many nuances of the 26 - year conflict are admittedly lost or overlooked			0
the film is a first entry point to this conflict for many			0
" @entity332 , a fellow and deputy director of the @entity334 at the @entity335 , took issue with an approach he said was focused on the white @entity339 's ability to parachute in and resolve a problem that @entity28 are unable to deal with themselves			2
" i think by portraying @entity339 as the only people who can crack this problem of @entity14 -- it 's simplistic , it 's naive , and it 's a little bit condescending as well , " he said			2
criticism aside , " @entity2 " is turning out to be the fastest growing social media video campaign , according to @entity347 , a company that tracks measures online movements			1
for perspective , the firm 's blog compared " @entity2 " to former video champ @entity353 , who has 480 million views			1
" it took @entity353 six days to reach 70 million views			1
@entity14 is tracking a day faster			0
even the @entity357 ca n't keep up			0
his legendary @entity360 campaign generated 35 million views in its first week , but it did n't top 70 million views until christmas 2010 , five months after it launched , " @entity358 said			1
" crazy , " said @entity147 of the video going viral			2
he 's hoping for a billion views			0
@entity0 's @entity366 , @entity367 , @entity368 and @entity369 contributed to this report .			0

70 million people have viewed ' @entity2 '
but questions surface about the @entity212 campaign and the nonprofit behind it
a @entity4 military spokesman says the video is 15 years too late
@entity9 admits it simplified a complex issue
