researchers in @entity1 have found a mammoth @entity4 - era @entity3 submarine scuttled by the @entity5 in 1946 to keep its advanced technology out of the hands of the @entity8			1
the @entity9 at the @entity10 discovered the @entity11 in 2,300 feet of water off the southwest coast of @entity14 , according the school			1
" finding it where we did was totally unexpected , " lab operations director and chief submarine pilot @entity16 said in a university statement			0
" all our research pointed to it being further out to sea			0
" piece of @entity24 ironclad brought to surface in @entity26 at nearly 400 feet long , the @entity11 and its two sister ships were the largest submarines ever built before the nuclear age			2
initially conceived as a weapon to target the @entity36 mainland and capable of reaching any point on the globe without refueling , the subs were effectively underwater aircraft carriers outfitted with three folding - wing seaplanes capable of carrying an 1,800 - pound bomb			1
the ships were never used to attack the mainland @entity36 and saw only limited service before @entity3 surrendered in 1945			0
but their novel design represented a tactical shift in thinking about the use of submarines , which until then had been strictly seen as anti-ship weapons , @entity44 , director of the @entity45 of the @entity46 , said in the university statement			2
shipwreck hunters stumble across mysterious find " following @entity4 , submarine experimentation and design changes would continue in this direction , eventually leading to ballistic missile launching capabilities for @entity36 submarines at the advent of the nuclear era , " @entity44 told the university			2
the submarine was found in august , but the laboratory did n't notify the public until after informing the @entity68 and the @entity3 government , the university said			0
the @entity11 was one of five @entity3 submarines captured by the @entity5 at the end of @entity4 and sent to @entity1 for examination , the school said			1
with tensions rising between the @entity8 and the @entity36 after the war , the @entity5 scuttled the ships to avoid their advanced technology falling into the hands of the @entity8 navy in what would become one of the first intrigues of the @entity84			1
the @entity9 has so far found four of the ships			0
@entity88 survivor , 91 , helps identify unknown dead			0

researchers find the remains of an advanced submarine sunk by the @entity5 in 1946
the @entity11 was *essentially* an underwater aircraft carrier
the @entity8 *wanted* to *inspect* the sub *'s* advanced technology
the sub represented a big shift in submarine tactics , a researcher says
