-- the @entity1 has stopped doing business with a large @entity4 bank , falling into line with a @entity7 - led sanctions push to restrict funding for @entity10 's nuclear programme			1
the decision to close the bank account follows an increase in tensions on the @entity15 and may be a sign that @entity17 is willing to place more pressure on @entity10			0
the @entity19 hit the @entity20 , @entity4 's main foreign exchange bank , with sanctions in march , saying it was " a key financial node " in @entity4 's nuclear and missile proliferation activities			1
the bank had not been named among the institutions targeted for asset freezes by expanded @entity29 sanctions introduced in january and march			0
other countries such as @entity31 and @entity32 have since joined the @entity7 in applying sanctions against @entity20 , but co-operation from banks in @entity37 , @entity4 's closest economic partner , is essential in the efforts to choke off cash flows			1
a drive to " put pressure on @entity17 to pressure @entity10 " needs to be at the heart of @entity44 's policy on @entity4 , according to @entity45 , until february the @entity7 assistant secretary of state for east @entity47			2
" @entity1 has sent @entity4 's @entity20 a notice that it has closed its account and has also halted all fund transfers related to this account , " @entity1 said on tuesday			2
it declined to provide any details about how much money was affected or the timing of the move			0
@entity1 is the country 's biggest bank for foreign exchange transactions , so the account closure could hurt the @entity4 institution			1
but the impact is likely to be minimal unless imposed across the board by all @entity37 banks because other institutions , including small regional entities , are also capable of handling foreign currency deals			0
" this is part of a ratcheting up of pressure but with very clear limits			0
this is part of making @entity4 feel some limited pain in an attempt to get them back to talks , " said @entity70 , northeast @entity47 director at the @entity71			0
the move by @entity1 may also reflect risk management by the bank itself rather than bigger diplomatic motives			1
the @entity19 had warned financial institutions around the world to be wary of the risks of doing business with @entity20			0
in 2006 after the @entity7 imposed sanctions on @entity87 , a @entity88 bank that held @entity4 funds , @entity1 responded in similar fashion by freezing @entity4 - related assets at its @entity88 branch			1
@entity37 is by far @entity4 's most important formal ally , and overwhelmingly its biggest trading partner			1
yet the alliance , which dates back to the @entity96 , has long been strained			0
analysts say that @entity10 has persistently refused @entity37 attempts to encourage it to emulate @entity17 's sweeping economic reforms , and @entity37 has grown increasingly alarmed by the regional security implications of @entity4 's nuclear weapons programme			1
earlier this year @entity17 endorsed two sets of new @entity29 sanctions against @entity10 , following its long - range rocket launch in december and nuclear bomb test in february			2
last month @entity37 's president @entity107 said that " no country should be allowed to throw a region and even the whole world into chaos for selfish gains " -- a comment widely interpreted as a rebuke of @entity4			2
many @entity37 businesses maintain close trading relationships with @entity4 , giving the country access to vital commodities and hard cash			0

@entity1 *cut* business with @entity4 's main foreign exchange ban
move follows @entity7 - led sanctions to restrict funding for @entity10 's nuclear program
@entity37 is @entity4 's closest economic partner
move may also reflect bank risk management rather than bigger diplomatic motive
