@entity0 -- the @entity2 rancher turned conservative folk hero for bucking the federal government 's attempts to stop his cattle from grazing on public land -- admits he does n't understand the bipartisan uproar over his comments suggesting blacks might have been better off under slavery			1
but in a contentious interview friday on @entity14 's " @entity13 , " @entity0 stood by his remarks , saying he 's not a racist but only somebody who speaks his mind , perhaps using politically incorrect language			1
" maybe i sinned , and maybe i need to ask forgiveness , and maybe i do n't know what i actually said , but when you talk about prejudice , we 're talking about not being able to exercise what we think			1
... if i say @entity32 or black boy or slave , if those people can not take those kind of words and not be ( offended ) , then @entity30 has n't got his job done yet , " he told anchor @entity27 on friday , adding , " we need to get over this prejudice stuff			1
" @entity0 brought up civil rights leader the rev. @entity30 and @entity39 , who was arrested in december 1955 for not giving up her seat on a public bus to a white man			1
the arrest sparked the @entity45 , @entity46 , bus boycott			0
@entity30 would have wanted @entity39 to sit anywhere on a bus , according to @entity0			1
the 67 - year - old added : " i want her to sit anywhere in the bus , and i want to sit next to her anywhere in the bus			0
" in one exchange with @entity27 , @entity0 said , " i do n't know how to talk about these ethnic groups			1
... " " then do n't , " @entity27 said			0
for two decades , @entity0 's cattle have fed off government - owned land without paying grazing fees like thousands of other ranchers			1
he claims he wo n't do business with the federal government because , in his view , the @entity62 does n't say @entity64 ca n't use land owned by the federal government			1
he said he 'd be willing to talk with state and local authorities			0
. " i 'll be damned if this is the property of the @entity64			1
they have no business here , " he said on " @entity13			0
" " this is a sovereign state , the sovereign state of @entity2			1
the federal government has nothing to do with public land in @entity2			1
" he said other ranchers are as frustrated as he is			0
this stance made him a darling of some conservatives in the media and @entity84 circles upset over what they 've deemed government overreach			2
militiamen rallied by the side of the 67 - year - old rancher as federal rangers tried to force him off his land			2
@entity0 won that standoff , but he did n't stop talking			1
speaking to reporters over the weekend , he recalled driving by a public housing project in @entity96 , @entity2 , and seeing " at least a half - dozen ( black ) people sitting on the porch , they did n't have nothing to do			1
" " because they were basically on government subsidy , so now what do they do ? " he added in comments first reported by @entity102 and later seen on video			0
" they abort their young children , they put their young men in jail , because they never learned how to pick cotton			0
" and i 've often wondered , are they better off as slaves , picking cotton and having a family life and doing things , or are they better off under government subsidy ? they did n't get no more freedom			2
" the remarks have since gone viral , drawing widespread condemnation from @entity126 and @entity84 alike			0
the rancher said he does n't feel " abandoned " by the uproar by the likes of right - wing radio firebrand and @entity132 host @entity131 , who has ripped what he called the " ignorant , racist , repugnant , despicable comments			0
" sen. @entity135 , who originally supported @entity0 's case , issued a statement thursday decrying @entity0 's racial comments			2
" his remarks on race are offensive and i wholeheartedly disagree with him , " said the @entity139 @entity84 , who 's considering a 2016 presidential run			0
@entity0 : another conservative folk hero exposes racial nerve @entity84 sen. @entity145 of @entity2 earlier called @entity0 's supporters " patriots			1
" but on thursday , the senator 's office said he " completely disagrees with mr. @entity0 's appalling and racist statements			2
" @entity152 chairman @entity151 , who had not weighed in on the land dispute , said @entity0 's words were " beyond the pale			1
" politicians denounce @entity0 's racist remarks on thursday , in an exclusive interview with @entity14 's @entity159 , @entity0 was asked to elaborate on his remarks			2
he explained he 'd been simply " wondering whether ( blacks ) are that much better off in the situation we 're in now			0
" he backtracked somewhat , insisting he " did n't really mean it to compare ( african - americans ' current plight ) with slavery			0
i meant to compare it with maybe life on the farm or life in the @entity172 , where they had some chickens and the gardens , and they had something to do			0
" at the same time , @entity0 stood by his general premise that blacks once had better lives -- stating that , right now , " they do n't have nothing to do with their children , their family unit is ruined			1
... that 's what i was referring to			0
i do n't think they have the life that they should have " because of the government			0
how did he arrive at these generalizations ? " i feel that , because i see that , " @entity0 explained			2
he said , " i do n't think i 'm wrong			0
i think i 'm right			0
" @entity159 at one point challenged the @entity2 rancher about whether he was any more or less a " welfare queen " since his cattle have been feeding off the government , literally , by eating grass on public land			1
@entity0 's response : " i might be a welfare queen			2
but i 'll tell you i 'm producing something for @entity64 and using a resource that nobody else would use or could use			2
i 'm putting red meat on the table			0
" on friday , the @entity210 elaborated on the rancher 's " @entity13 " comments			0
the post concluded with these sentences : " i am doing the same thing @entity39 did -- i am standing up against bad laws which dehumanize us and destroy our freedom			0
just like the @entity219 at @entity220 , we are saying no to an oppressive government which considers us to be slaves rather than free men			1
" i invite all people in @entity64 to join in our peaceful revolution to regain our freedom			2
that is how @entity64 was started , and we need to keep that tradition alive			2
" in a press conference later friday , @entity0 added that while he is " tired " personally he is " not tired of talking about race			1
" " it 's time the @entity64 had a discussion about race , " he said			1
" ... i think all races should be talking about this , having their opinions and defending their liberties			0

@entity0 says he is " not tired of talking about race "
the @entity2 rancher has *battled* @entity64 government over his cattle grazing free on public land
he came under fire after suggesting blacks may have been better off as slaves
" we need to get over this prejudice stuff , " he says
