-- @entity1 really wants to know what you look like			2
the social network this week acquired @entity5 , a face - recognition technology company whose @entity1 and mobile apps can identify people 's faces in photos			1
one of @entity5 's apps , @entity13 , aims to identify @entity1 friends ' faces on mobile - phone photos as they 're taken			1
" fire up @entity13 and watch as your friends ' names instantly appear next to their faces before or after you snap a photo , " the company says on its @entity19 page for the app. " if @entity13 does n't recognize a face use the new ' @entity23 ' mode to train and improve recognition			1
" another app , @entity31 , works with @entity1 to " auto - tag " faces in photo albums			2
it 's unclear exactly how @entity1 plans to incorporate the technology and employees of @entity5 , which it purchased for between $ 55 million and $ 100 million , according to news reports			1
( the exact terms of the deal have n't been disclosed			0
) but @entity41 , a blogger at @entity42 , says it 's likely that @entity1 wants to use the company 's mobile experience to improve the face - detection technology on its smartphone and tablet apps			1
" currently , @entity1 's tagging suggestion feature does not work for mobile devices as well as it does on desktops , so it 's possible that @entity5 could make it faster for mobile users to tag from their mobile uploads with less friction , " he writes			1
" and that timing makes sense , considering that @entity1 just recently launched camera , a standalone photo app that makes it even easier for users to snap and upload photos to @entity1 without going through the cumbersome -- and , frankly , rather clunky and slow -- @entity62 and @entity64 applications			2
" in a post on the company 's blog , @entity5 ceo @entity65 also indicates its products could help boost @entity1 's mobile offerings			1
" we love building products , and like our friends at @entity1 , we think that mobile is a critical part of people 's lives as they both create and consume content , and share content with their social graph , " he writes			1
" by working with @entity1 directly , and joining their team , we 'll have more opportunities to build amazing products that will be employed by consumers -- that 's all we 've ever wanted to do			2
" @entity1 issued the following statement to @entity0 in an e-mail : " people who use @entity1 enjoy sharing photos and memories with their friends , and @entity5 's technology has helped to provide the best photo experience			1
this transaction simply brings a world - class team and a long - time technology vendor in house			0
" a company spokeswoman declined to comment further because the @entity5 deal has not been closed			0
all of this is important because @entity1 is the most popular place on the internet for photo sharing			0
according to the @entity106 - based company , people upload an average of 300 million photos to @entity1 every day			2
that 's nearly one for every person in the @entity111			0
@entity1 already employs face - detection technology to help ( some might say prod ) users to identify themselves and their friends in the photos they upload to the site			1
when friends tag each other in photos , they make it more likely that other people on the network will see the pictures			0
but , for some @entity1 users , the existing face - detection feature is either unwanted or unworkable			1
" i try to time and time again ( to use the feature ) , but @entity1 always manages to claim i 'm someone i 'm not			0
the detection technology is n't quite there , " wrote one @entity131 user , @ @entity132			0
in response to @ cnntech 's query on the subject , another person wrote that @entity1 's auto - tagging feature confuses their friends for their siblings			1
" it 's a bit scary to be honest , " wrote another @entity131 user , @ earthtonadia			0
@entity1 gives users the option to turn off face detection			0
to do so , go to your privacy settings ( click the arrow at the top right of the homepage to get there ) and then edit your " @entity154 " settings			0
at the bottom of the list , @entity1 asks , " who sees tag suggestions when photos that look like you are uploaded ? " change that setting to " @entity162 " if you do n't want to have your face detected			2
users also can choose to review the photos they 're tagged in before the tags show up on @entity1			0
or , if you want to get funky , you could always wear bizzaro hats and makeup that prevent face - detection technology from working			2
for more on that , read about this project from @entity172 .			0

@entity1 buys face - recognition site @entity5
the company makes apps that identify friends ' faces in photos
@entity1 already has a face - recognition feature on its site
but @entity5 's technology could improve mobile face recognition for @entity1
