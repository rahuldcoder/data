@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity14 ' marital " transgressions " may have cast doubt on the future of his corporate associations , but history shows that a dose of bad publicity does not always mean an end to the earning power of sport stars			1
the world 's no. 1 golfer has not been seen in advertisements on @entity19 television since november 29 according to media research company @entity20 , with the blackout starting just two days after he crashed his car outside his house -- reportedly following an argument with his wife			0
but @entity26 , director of international sponsorship agency @entity27 , believes that although @entity14 faces an uncertain corporate future , his marketability will remain if he thinks creatively			1
" it all depends on how long the story will stay on the front page			0
a story like this makes sponsors very nervous because they do n't know if there 's more to come , " he told @entity2			2
" most companies will have a morality clause as part of the contract with a big name like @entity14			0
this is usually enforced because of drugs [ or criminal issues ] , but in a situation like this which is ongoing , there 's a good chance these companies will exercise their rights and jump ship			0
" however , while @entity14 -- , the first sportsman to earn $ 1 billion -- might possibly lose some sponsors , other revenue streams could be exploited , according to @entity26			1
will @entity14 return to golf the same ? " this chink in his armor wo n't impact his earning capacity , but companies and brands will think differently in the future			1
it will open up new offers and close a few doors too , " he said			0
while golf is traditionally a very conservative sport which attracts like minded backers , it is still possible to bring in sponsors even in cases as extreme as @entity72 -- whose drinking , smoking and eating problems put his career at risk			1
@entity72 's less than wholesome image paid dividends in 2005 when the @entity19 teamed up with restaurant chain @entity80 , known for its scantily - clad waitresses , in what seemed a mutually beneficial arrangement			1
@entity80 vice-president @entity84 said in a statement on @entity72 's web site : " @entity72 is unique , successful and a man of the people who does n't really worry too much about what the establishment thinks			1
in fact he 's a lot like @entity80			0
" but the appeal of @entity72 's carefree attitude also proved to be his downfall when , in november 2008 , the golfer was found drunk and face down in a flower bed outside a @entity80 restaurant			2
earlier this year , @entity80 quietly relinquished their contract with the colorful , larger - than - life character			0
another player who has successfully surfed the wave of marketing and endorsement despite a checkered personal life is @entity109 golfing legend @entity108			0
despite two divorces and a number of well - documented affairs -- including a three - year liaison with 20 - year - old @entity115 which ended famously with the @entity19 student battering @entity108 's @entity117 with a golf club -- sponsorship has never eluded the golfer			1
@entity108 also went on to cement his position among the game 's elite when he captained the @entity124 team in 2008			2
@entity125 will tell if @entity14 ' self - confessed " personal failings " will impact on his career , but his world - beating marketability may have to undergo some change .			2
