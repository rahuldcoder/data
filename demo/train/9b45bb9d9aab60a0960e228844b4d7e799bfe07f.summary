-- they are everywhere , @entity2 's precious and beautiful children			1
they make up more than a third of the country 's 10 million - plus population			1
you see them on rooftops -- where there are rooftops -- flying kites			2
you see them gathered in small circles on the ground -- where the ground is not muddy -- playing marbles			2
you see them skip around where the ground is muddy , sometimes bathing in water from manholes			2
you see them link hands and run in a circle while singing a song associated with the won , the @entity2 equivalent of " @entity32			1
" you see them fight for a turn at jumping rope			2
you see them twirl a bicycle wheel with a bent rope hanger and in that act you can see the dream of one day actually driving the rest of the bike , or a motorcycle , a car or an airplane			2
you see them carry gallons and buckets of water on tiny heads that have no place to rest			2
you see them suddenly appear in the middle of @entity60 's impenetrable traffic and , dressed in dirty rags , plop an even dirtier rag on the hood of your car			1
you see them file in and out of the same traffic wearing striking school uniforms with different color plaid tops			0
sometimes you see them wearing their sunday best in the middle of the week			0
for more about @entity0 's " rescued " documentary , read here you see them packed into tents made of sticks and bedsheets -- and if they 're lucky , tarp or plastic -- and some of them appear listless , their bloated bellies and reddened hair competing for your attention			1
if you say hello , some will answer you but they will avoid your gaze , both out of respect for you and shame at their condition			0
you see them stand in lines , backs straight even while the sun beats down on their heads and sweat rolls down their faces , as they wait for a bottle of water or a plate of food			0
you see them wobble on makeshift crutches for their newly amputated limbs even as they wince from pain that even some adults would find difficult to bear			0
nevertheless they are children , @entity2 's future			1
the january 12 , 2010 , earthquake changed their lives			1
many watched loved ones die , lost family members and other caretakers , one or both of their parents , siblings			0
many were stuck in the rubble of their homes and were rescued several days later			1
yet in spite of everything , they dream , they laugh , they live , they love			0
like most other children , they adore seeing their faces reflected in the back of a digital camera			1
" @entity137 , @entity137 , " they will say respectfully if they want to ask or tell you something			0
during such a conversation , i tell a little girl who is the same age as my eldest daughter , @entity142 , " at home i have one exactly like you			0
" " there is no one exactly like me , " she replies			0
no child is exactly like any other , but all children want and need some basic things : food , shelter , safety , education , love			1
@entity155 , says the @entity2 proverb			1
our children are our treasures			1
some of them are diamonds in the rough			0
some of them are brilliant , nearly illuminated beings			0
now some are also scarred , both physically and psychologically			0
in one large tent city , i find the 7 - year - old son of a man i knew growing up			0
the boy is in the camp with his mother while his father is in @entity174 , @entity175 , with his baby sister , whose hip was broken during the earthquake			2
" i sleep during the day , " he says , " because the thieves come at night			0
" the child he plays with most often is an orphan who was taken in by a neighbor			0
after the earthquake , people kept asking me , " why do n't we see @entity2 adopting @entity2 kids ? why is it always the blan , the foreigners , the missionaries ? " many @entity2 adopt informally			1
if they did n't you would see many more abandoned children on the earthquake - ravaged streets of @entity2 's capital and in the countryside			1
some kids do fall prey to the local restavèk system of child labor , but others are taken into loving homes , sharing equally the little bit their guardians have			0
@entity2 's children have suffered more than any child , or adult , should have to , yet they still represent the best that @entity2 has to offer			1
the potential for a better country rests on their shoulders			1
the survival of @entity2 's children means the survival of @entity2			1
their success guarantees the country 's future			2
like children all over the world , @entity2 's children are resilient and brave , but they are also children , our children			1
if , as the @entity222 proverb states , it takes a village to raise a child , it will take several villages to raise these children			2
when it was discovered that the " orphans " who were being taken to the @entity232 by the 10 @entity234 missionaries had parents , some people asked me how @entity2 mothers and fathers could simply give their children away			1
i offered them the answer that a mother who turned her child over to an orphanage years ago recently gave me			0
" it 's like the way they were cutting up people 's limbs to save their lives after the earthquake			1
i cut my heart out by letting my child go			0
even if it means i have to cry every single day for the rest of my life , i want my child to have a future			0
" that future sometimes seems illusive			0
but it is as real as the children themselves			2
worn out perhaps , but not totally defeated , dreaming , laughing , playing , living with a glint of hope and promise in their eyes			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity267 .			1
