-- it is in our dna to explore the unknown			0
but pushing boundaries and exploring space is far from easy			2
this week , the commercial space industry received a punch in the gut and the world experienced a jarring reminder of just how dangerous space travel can be			1
on its 55th test flight , @entity14 's @entity13 suffered " an anomaly " just two minutes after it separated from its mother ship , @entity17 , while 45,000 feet over the @entity18			1
one pilot was able to parachute out and is being treated for serious injuries , but tragically , the other perished			0
the catastrophe comes on the heels of an explosion that happened earlier in the week when an unmanned rocket built by @entity27 carrying a spacecraft loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of cargo exploded into a fireball just seconds after launch at @entity33 's @entity32 in @entity34			1
aerospace insiders routinely compare the emerging commercial space industry to the genesis of the aviation industry -- high risk , high reward			2
@entity14 founder @entity41 said in a blog post following friday 's incident : " we 've always known that the road to space is extremely difficult - and that every new transportation system has to deal with bad days early in their history			1
" a new private space race has emerged in recent years , with private companies like @entity14 and @entity52 competing to become the world 's first commercial space line			1
then you have companies like @entity57 , @entity27 , and @entity58 that are vying for @entity33 contracts worth billions			2
this week 's events put the spotlight on the private sector 's ability to shoulder the responsibility of space travel			1
what will the long - term impacts of disasters have on the burgeoning commercial space industry ? it should be noted , that in terms of the larger government contracts , this relationship between the public and the private is not really all that new			2
since the inception of the space agency , @entity33 has turned to the private sector to accomplish its space faring goals			1
@entity58 is the lead contractor on the @entity81			0
it is not a relationship we will see change anytime soon , even in the face of the @entity27 accident			2
that is because the @entity89 no longer has a home - grown way to get to the @entity81			0
@entity33 is relying on the private sector to get there -- making commercial companies essential to the space agency 's operations thus shielding them from the impact of public perception			1
the space tourism industry is different			0
the service it is providing is a luxury experience			0
the companies are at the mercy of public perception of their capabilities to safely transport paying passengers on these suborbital flights			1
yes , @entity14 has partnered with @entity33 to run research missions in zero - gravity , but beyond that , @entity14 relies on selling tickets to space enthusiasts and adrenaline junkies for the bulk of its development cost			1
and they are n't cheap			0
it costs $ 250,000 a seat			0
passengers want to know they are going to be safe			0
friday 's accident will surely instil fear in the more than 700 people who have signed up to make the journey			0
so what is the value of space tourism ? and why risk human lives to make it a reality ? as @entity133 told @entity0 earlier this year : " at heart , what inspires me the most is the idea that space changes you , that space has this profound impact on the people that can experience it			0
" what @entity133 is referring to is the overview effect , a phenomenon that space travelers are said to experience when they see the curvature of the @entity149 -- changing the way people see the world , thereby influencing the way in which they live			0
both @entity133 and @entity41 have spoken openly about the fact that suborbital flights are not the ultimate end goal for @entity14			1
point - to - point intercontinental travel would be the next application of this technology , meaning that one day passengers could travel around the world in about two hours			0
while such plans have been put on hold since the accident , @entity14 is intent on taking off			1
in his blog post following the crash , @entity41 said : " space is hard -- but worth it			2
we will persevere and move forward together			0
" the question is , will people still be willing to pay $ 250,000 to go to space ? inside @entity14 's spaceship perils of aviation pioneers			1

the @entity13 catastrophe comes after an @entity27 rocket blew up
@entity14 founder @entity41 : " we 've always known that the road to space is extremely difficult "
accidents have put spotlight on private sector 's ability to shoulder responsibility of space travel
@entity14 has spoken openly about its *ambitions* beyond suborbital flights
