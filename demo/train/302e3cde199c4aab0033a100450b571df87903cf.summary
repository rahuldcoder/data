-- the letter @entity2 wrote was fraught with emotion : " dear food , " it began			1
" you have given me a reason to live , a cotton candy cloud to land on , a spaghetti pool to swim in , a sweet and sometimes sour pat on the back after long days			2
you have been my dearest friend and my most painful enemy			2
my love , my hate , my utter confusion			2
" it 's a letter @entity17 still has , though she penned it nearly two years ago at a weight loss retreat			1
she reads it when she 's angry or upset and is starting to think , again , that food can fix whatever is bothering her			2
" i was married to food for so long , " she said			2
" that was the only relationship that mattered to me			2
every food has its own story			2
" there 's the salad she ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner that tells the story of her summer of starvation			2
there 's the box of @entity39 that got her through the aftermath of her college roommate 's death			2
there 's the pizza she used to order from the restaurant across the street , the one she could eat by herself in under an hour , with a bowl of pasta on the side and a large piece of cake for dessert			2
" @entity60 " does n't even begin to describe @entity17 's struggle with her weight			1
it 's a struggle she 's learned to accept -- even embrace -- as an important part of her past			2
" i do n't think people go through huge obstacles to amount to nothing , " she said			1
freshman 15 at 5 feet 5 inches tall , @entity2 kept active with sports in high school , and her weight hovered around 150 pounds			1
when she wanted to drop a few , she hit the gym with friends			2
it was fun , casual and never a major focus in her teenage years			1
in fall 2007 , she headed to @entity78 in @entity79			2
the dreaded " freshman 15 " crept up on her , and when she headed home for the summer , @entity2 decided to fight the weight gain by counting calories			1
the first day , she ate sandwiches , pita chips and vegetables			2
but full , healthy meals soon turned into tiny salads			0
after a couple weeks , @entity2 was limiting herself to only 800 calories a day			1
( experts warn against eating less than 1,200 calories a day because it sends your body into starvation mode			1
) one day a week , she binged , allowing herself to eat whatever she wanted as a reward			1
one night after downing a hamburger , a chicken sandwich and some fries , she attempted to throw up her food for the first time			0
" i was scared of having all those calories in my body , " she remembered			0
" i did n't know what to do to get rid of them			1
" but bulimia did n't " suit " her body , she said			1
" i just wanted the act of eating			1
" @entity111 shakes off 170 pounds over the summer , @entity2 lost more than 30 pounds			1
she got tons of compliments from her classmates , who could n't believe she 'd dropped so much weight in such a short amount of time			1
she weighed her 127 - pound body daily and wrote down everything she ate			0
she even brought her own salad dressing to the dining hall to make sure she knew exactly how many calories she was consuming			0
@entity2 ran four miles a day , six days a week , and spent an additional hour at the gym doing weights			1
" it became an obsession , " she said			0
" did i do good today or bad today ? it was always all or nothing			0
" it was an odd time in her life			0
in between salads , she remembers sneaking to the grocery store to buy cake and then eating it in the bathroom of her dorm so her friends would n't see			1
" i cared very much how other people thought of me			0
" a tragic accident on the morning of @entity140 2009 , @entity2 got a call			1
her roommate , who had spent the previous night in another room , was dead			0
" it broke me , " @entity2 said , refusing to talk about what happened even now			1
for days , she could n't eat			1
then one afternoon she asked her boyfriend to pick up some @entity39 and a box of @entity148			0
" i thought , ' this helped			0
i do n't have to think right now about what happened , ' " she said			1
she started using food to cope with her pain and then blaming herself for using food to cope -- although it 's unlikely she knew she was doing so at the time			0
she felt depressed and guilty , and food simply made her feel better			0
when her boyfriend of a year and half broke up with her shortly after her roommate 's death , she went to the grocery store and bought bags of chips and several boxes of crackers			1
in the months that followed , she forgot all about the lean proteins and vegetables that used to make up her diet			0
' i could n't walk ' : woman loses 276 pounds @entity2 's mom and dad were concerned about her but did n't realize food was becoming an issue , she says			1
before her junior year , they moved her into a new apartment because she was nervous about sharing space with someone again			1
but living alone just enabled @entity17 to binge without worrying about people looking over her shoulder			1
she started to ignore calls from friends and threw herself into her schoolwork			0
the day after she graduated college in may 2011 , @entity2 stepped on the scale for the first time in years			1
her legs trembled when she saw the number : 240			0
she had gained more than 100 pounds in two years			1
she sat down at the kitchen table with her mom , and together they cried			0
a new balance until @entity198 -- the latest version of the psychiatric diagnostic manual -- was released this month , binge eating was n't an official eating disorder			1
many who have it simply think they are gluttons who lack self - control , says @entity206 , a registered dietitian and co-owner of the @entity208 at @entity210 weight loss retreat in @entity211			0
the disorder is characterized by frequent episodes of overeating in a short periods of time			1
people with the disorder feel out of control during binges and are often disgusted with themselves afterward			1
the usually eat alone because they 're uncomfortable consuming so much in front of others			0
it 's estimated that 3.5 % of women and 2 % of men in the @entity226 have the disorder , but @entity206 says experts believe it 's " extremely underdiagnosed			2
" doctors used treat the disorder by putting patients on a diet			2
they now know " that is absolutely the wrong thing to do , " @entity206 said			0
" many people who have binge - eating disorder , they 're eating food to cope with their feelings			1
if you try to take away food without giving them something else to cope , you 're stranding that person			0
and you make them feel guilty when they go back to the one strategy they know			0
" @entity2 went to @entity208 in the summer of 2011			1
she chose the retreat because it focused on helping women have a healthy relationship with food rather than focusing solely on losing weight			0
the first priority at the retreat , @entity206 says , is to get patients to eat regular , small meals that are based on the government 's @entity258 guidelines			0
many people who binge go long periods of time in between without eating to try to save calories , which can lead to more binge eating later on			1
the next step is therapy , where the patients learn other strategies for coping with their emotions			0
for @entity17 , that meant writing			1
she purged her emotions into a journal and tried to forgive herself for using food to cope			0
she bonded with other women at the retreat who were all just " trying to get to a happy place			0
" " for the first time , i was not alone , " she remembered			0
" i was not sitting alone in my car or in room somewhere or in a bathroom stall , eating			2
... this place really acknowledged that we 're all real people with real problems			0
" four weeks later , @entity2 left with a better understanding of her disorder			1
she knew that she could n't go back to the same environment that had led her to this pain , so she packed up and moved cross-country to live near her brother in @entity292			2
learning to eat again : man drops 130 pounds after surgery a happy place @entity2 has n't had a binge in two years			1
since leaving @entity208 , she 's lost 70 pounds			1
she lives with her new boyfriend and another roommate , a significant step in her recovery			0
she no longer feels the urge to eat mass quantities of pasta ; food is fun now , though she still struggles with certain types			0
pizza , for instance , scares her , since it was a binge eating trigger			1
" it 's kind of like seeing an ex-boyfriend and not being sure how to handle that situation , " she explained			0
" i get a whole slew of emotions that run through my body : i want to devour you			0
i need to stay away from you			0
i want you in my life			0
" she keeps healthy snacks like baby carrots and cottage cheese on hand but allows herself gummy bears when she wants them			0
she 's back at the gym but has made it into an activity she does with her boyfriend rather than an obsession			0
@entity2 is also writing for @entity208 's blog , @entity331 , in hopes of reaching out to other women who are struggling			1
" my goal is to just feel better , " she said			0
" i 'm hoping that with this story and with my blog ... i 'm hoping that what i 've gone through is really going to make a difference in somebody else 's life			0
" have you lost weight ? share your story on @entity344			2
