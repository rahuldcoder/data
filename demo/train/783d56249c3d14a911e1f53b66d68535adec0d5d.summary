@entity0 -- @entity3 's high court has upheld a prison sentence for former prime minister @entity5 in a tax fraud case			1
the court thursday said it supported a lower court 's four - year prison sentence for @entity5			1
three years of that sentence are covered in an amnesty aimed at cutting down on prison overcrowding , effectively reducing @entity5 's sentence to one year			2
the high court also ordered a lower court to reconsider whether @entity5 , 76 , should be banned from public office -- a controversial issue that could play a key role in the country 's political future			1
a lower court convicted @entity5 of tax evasion last october , sentencing him to four years in prison and barring him from public office for five years			1
in may , an @entity3 appeals court in @entity26 upheld that decision			0
the former prime minister ca n't appeal the high court 's decision in the case			1
but it 's unlikely he 'll spend time behind bars , because of his age and the shortness of the sentence			0
@entity5 is a member of @entity3 's @entity38 and therefore enjoys immunity from any type of arrest			0
the @entity38 would have to vote to have his immunity lifted in order to serve any sentence			0
@entity5 , who served on and off as prime minister between 1994 and 2011 , is one of the most colorful and controversial figures in the lively history of @entity3 politics			1
a look at the life of @entity5 for years , he has been entangled in fraud , corruption and sex scandals that have often reached @entity3 courts			0
in june , a panel of judges sentenced @entity5 to seven years in prison for abusing power and having sex with an underage prostitute			0
@entity5 's attorney told reporters he plans to appeal that conviction			2
undaunted by the court battles , @entity5 has not only launched appeals , but in december made two significant announcements : his engagement to 27 - year - old @entity68 , and then , his political comeback			0
in @entity3 's february elections , the three - time prime minister appealed to @entity3 voters by denouncing the unpopular austerity policies of technocrat @entity74			1
for all his critics , @entity5 won almost 30 % of the vote in february and remains an influential figure in prime minister @entity79 's fragile coalition government			2
@entity1 's @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 contributed to this report .			0

@entity5 's conviction is upheld , but the *impact* on his political *career* is *unclear*
