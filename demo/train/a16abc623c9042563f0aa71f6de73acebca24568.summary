-- most conservationists would agree that you should not interfere with mother nature			1
but there are exceptions to every rule			0
staff and tourists at @entity9 in @entity10 were caught by surprise when a mother and baby elephant became trapped in mud			1
saying they could n't just " stand by and watch them slowly die , " what ensued was a dramatic rescue			0
together with the @entity20 ( @entity21 ) and the local wildlife authority , the team devised a plan to get the elephants out			2
the rest of the herd initially tried to help the screaming mother and baby escape , but they were stuck too deep			1
team managers from the conservation society slipped a rope around the baby and after a few attempts managed to pull her out of the muddy pit			2
the team says it took a lot of coaxing to get her out and on her feet though , adding that she " was terribly frightened and would n't leave her mum 's side "			0
getting the adult elephant out of the mud was a far more challenging task -- by the time the baby had been rescued , its mother was dehydrated and exhausted			1
but the @entity21 team eventually pulled her out too , using a tractor and rope			0
staff at @entity53 say it was " heart - warming to see how many local people joined in the efforts to free the two elephants ... it was the happiest possible ending			0
