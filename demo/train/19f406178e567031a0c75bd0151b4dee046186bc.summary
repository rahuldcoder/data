-- stacking building blocks is a popular way for children to fight boredom			2
now stacking food cans has become part of a national campaign to fight hunger			1
an @entity10 - based organization called @entity11 challenges architects , engineers and volunteers to make sculptures by using cans of food			1
the late @entity18 founded @entity11 in 1992 in @entity19 after seeing similar exhibits in @entity21 and @entity22			2
one year later , she started the first competition in @entity19			2
@entity11 coordinates relief efforts with dozens of cities around the @entity26 , from @entity27 , @entity28 , to @entity29 , @entity30			1
the exhibits are held in public places such as malls , convention centers or even state fairs			2
the idea is that volunteers are able to raise supplies for food banks and simultaneously raise awareness of the problem of hunger throughout the @entity26			1
a 2012 @entity26 @entity44 report estimated there are around 49 million people who live in " food insecure " households ( meaning anyone who is at risk of hunger or may not have consistent access to food			1
) of that total , 8.3 million are children			1
@entity56 has collected more than 25 million pounds of food since its first competition more than 20 years ago			1
" it 's important for us that we continue to get the word out , " said @entity62 , chair of the @entity11 competition in @entity64 , " so people are aware of the hunger issues that we have , not only here in @entity69 but across the country because it 's a big issue			2
" judges grade the exhibits on their structural design , attention to detail , creativity and level of difficulty			2
when the event is over , the cans are donated to local food pantries			1
" it 's a really creative outlet for people , " @entity62 said			2
" it 's a huge event , and it 's just a lot of fun for all of us			2
" the idea of @entity11 is pretty simple			0
making one ? not so much			0
groups of five to 10 people start planning and designing months before the event			0
they are responsible for finding can labels with colors that match their design as well as raising enough money to pay for them			0
@entity56 's motto to solving hunger is " one can at a time , " but some projects , such as the @entity64 best use of label winner from 2013 , included as many as 7,000 cans -- all tuna			1
it was four - sided , one with the rev. @entity108 , one with @entity109 , one with @entity110 and one with a large @entity111			0
the time limit for building varies			0
but most groups finish their designs within seven hours , depending on the number of cans and the complexity of the project			1
despite the sinuous arcs and bends that seemingly defy gravity , the use of glue , leveling boards and most other foreign objects are prohibited			0
" you can use materials for leveling purposes , such as up to a quarter - inch plywood or @entity133 or cardboard , " said @entity126 , co-chair of the @entity128 , @entity19 , event			0
" but those structures should be self - supporting out of cans			1
they discourage the use of props of any kind -- not taping eyes onto something but trying to use the labels to create the effect			0
" the culmination of months of planning , designing , fund - raising and , finally , building is a completed product of which the " architects " can be proud			0
but what goes up must come down			0
after a few weeks on display , the cans are " de-canstructed " and transported to charity			1
like the feeling of slicing up a colorful cake you do n't want to cut into , the emotion of clearing away the cans can be bittersweet			1
" it 's a little sad to see all of that hard work come back down , " @entity160 said			0
" but since we know that all of the food is going to a great cause , i think it makes it a little bit better			1
" proceeds of the @entity128 event go to the @entity171 of @entity172			0
@entity160 said its workers are happy to have a large donation around the beginning of september			0
the number of charitable donations spike during major holidays such as @entity180 and @entity181			0
but the need for hunger relief continues year - round , even after the holiday spirit goes away			0
" you always hear the news reports -- the food bank is having trouble or the food bank has a deficit , " said @entity185 , chair of the @entity11 event			1
@entity194 's modest goal ? " maybe one less news report a year that the food bank is struggling			1

around 49 million @entity26 are " food insecure , " @entity44 report says
@entity56 has collected more than 25 million pounds of food for food banks since 1993
some sculpture projects use up to 7,000 cans of food
sculptures are later dismantled , and cans are donated to local food pantries
