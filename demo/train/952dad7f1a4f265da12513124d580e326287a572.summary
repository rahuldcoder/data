-- @entity2 prosecutors dropped charges against one of two men arrested in a chaotic motorcycle chase that ended in the beating of suv driver @entity8			1
it started when his @entity10 collided with a motorcycle in a phalanx riding down a @entity15 highway on sunday			1
video , taken by a camera on the helmet of one of the many bikers who chased @entity8 as he sped away , shows bikers catching up with @entity8 's suv and bashing its windows			1
this has brought bikers under intense scrutiny			1
but i 'll say it : motorbike enthusiasts , on the whole , get a bad rap			1
a minority of them cause trouble , sometimes a lot of trouble , which causes an undeserved prejudice against the majority			2
and that prejudice can subtly influence law enforcement , just as it can the public at large			2
bikers have a rich history of misbehavior			2
in the most infamous case , the @entity44 hired the @entity46 to provide security at a concert in 1969 at @entity49 , @entity50			1
a member of the audience was killed by a gang member , reaffirming the bikers ' reputation as thugs			2
most bikers who tarnish motorcyclists ' reputation commit far less dramatic and tragic acts			1
riders do themselves no good when they remove the perfectly operational mufflers from their bike for maximum urban volume or pop wheelies in a downtown metropolis			2
at minimum , these riders are massively annoying , and at worst , they are very dangerous			2
either way , the bias against many is caused by the few			1
the transgressions of a few bikers do not represent the true biker spirit , which is a celebrated part of @entity77			1
like the cowboys and horsemen of the frontier , riding the open road exemplifies the rugged individualist tradition of our country			2
but like many issues in society and law , often the actions of few negatively affect the policies applied to the rest of us			1
how important is bias ? the arrest , and the almost immediate dropping of charges , demonstrate how fine the line is between " criminal " and " victim " in a police investigation			1
have you noticed that every news story has mentioned " @entity10 " several times ? what if the @entity10 was a @entity104 ? how about a 1980 @entity105 ? would that make the driver more sympathetic to you ? less sympathetic ? @entity99 is intrinsically neither evil nor good			1
how fine is the line between victim and defendant ? consider how the law might apply to these facts : first , in the video , a motorcyclist appears to deliberately slow down in front of the suv , which then collides with the cycle			1
the law in most states presumptively holds the rear ending vehicle liable			2
if the driver in front makes a sudden stop , that can overcome this presumption			1
but in the case of rear enders , even defense attorneys will often concede liability , so it 's certainly possible that a jury could find @entity8 completely at fault for an accident			1
second , as bikers surround his vehicle , @entity8 speeds away			2
as he drives off , motorcyclist @entity138 is run over in the chaos			2
@entity138 remains hospitalized with two broken legs and spinal injuries and might be paralyzed for life			0
those are very serious injuries under any civil standard or penal code			0
if it 's proven that @entity8 ran over @entity138 , he could be considered a " fleeing felon			0
" @entity2 , like other states , criminalizes leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident			0
in a case like this , in which someone is seriously injured , flight is a potential felony			1
so was @entity8 fleeing for his life , or was he a fleeing felon ? third , it 's true that a lot of bikers gave chase			1
was this alone permissible ? in @entity2 , a citizen acting on his own may use non-deadly force to prevent the escape of a person who has committed a crime			0
@entity8 's tires were slashed and his windows bashed in			0
was that appropriate force ? those acts themselves are non-deadly			0
if so , were the bikers apprehending a fleeing criminal within the law ? finally , if any of the bikers charged claim they were justified in preventing the escape of a criminal , the burden is on the prosecution to disprove it and disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt			0
police officers have the unenviable task of making snap judgments under chaotic circumstances			0
they 're human , as is their process of assigning blame			0
@entity2 police commissioner @entity190 says the investigation is continuing			0
more arrests on more serious charges may follow			0
motorcyclist @entity194 faces reckless driving charges after police say he was the one who slowed down in front of @entity8 's @entity198 and touched off the whole bloody encounter			0
nobody has been charged yet in the actual beating that sent @entity8 to the hospital , but @entity194 's attorney has told reporters that his client is not guilty			0
what would you do ? whoever is charged , you have this dilemma			0
party no. 1 , a young male member of a noisy biker rally carving up the @entity213 no. 2 , a 33 - year - old dad out for a sunday drive with his wife and baby			1
who do you think gets the benefit of the doubt in a close call ? that 's bias			1
it 's not intentional , and it 's not categorically evil			0
but a lot of people do n't realize that there 's often a fine line between criminal and complaining witness in our criminal justice system			0
the proliferation of technology and video evidence has made investigations more objective , but it 's unreasonable to think humans can cure themselves of all prejudice			0
are bikers discriminated against unfairly ? maybe			0
but the alternative for them is taking up a less controversial pastime , and i do n't see them trading their rides for golf clubs anytime soon			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 .			1

@entity251 : case of driver beaten by motorcyclists raises issues of bias
@entity251 : motorbike enthusiasts get a bad rap for the transgressions of a few
the true biker spirit is a celebrated part of @entity77 , @entity251 says
he asks : in a trial that puts a man in a biker rally vs a dad in an suv , who wins ?
