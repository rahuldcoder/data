-- a radiation monitor in @entity3 has detected a trace of radioactive material from the stricken nuclear power plant in @entity7 , the @entity1 said friday			1
the exact amounts were not available , but the test ban organization 's executive secretary , @entity9 , said the measurements were below what would be considered harmful to human health			2
the treaty organization 's chief press officer , @entity14 , said its officials were " absolutely certain " that the radiation detected in @entity3 is from @entity21 because the isotypes were consistent with those emitted by the @entity21 reactors , and the timing of their detection is consistent with projections			1
the test ban organization maintains a worldwide network of monitoring stations to look for evidence of nuclear explosions that could violate the prohibition in its namesake treaty , which has not come into force , against nuclear weapons testing			2
the treaty has been ratified by 153 nations but the @entity36 is not one of them			0
the organization announced friday that it has started sharing its monitoring data and analysis reports with the @entity42 and the @entity43 because it could prove useful in cases like @entity7 's			0
the @entity46 monitor detected minute amounts of radionuclides -- substances that emit radiation -- which had been expected , @entity9 said			1
the @entity52 , in a statement , confirmed that a monitoring station in @entity46 that feeds into the treaty organization 's monitoring system " detected minuscule quantities of the radioactive isotope xenon - 133 , a gas that is produced during nuclear fission			1
the origin was determined to be consistent with a release from the @entity21 reactors in northern @entity7			0
" it added , " these types of readings remain consistent with our expectations since the onset of this tragedy , and are to be expected in the coming days			0
" it said the @entity52 's system " has not detected any radiation levels of concern			1
" it described the exposure as " approximately one - millionth of the dose rate that a person normally receives from rocks , bricks , the sun and other natural background sources			1
" @entity52 spokesman @entity82 said monitors at three sites operated by the @entity85 for the @entity52 have not recorded anything higher than the typical " background " levels seen before the march 11 earthquake and tsunami in @entity7			1
" we do not expect to see harmful levels of radiation , " he said			2
the test ban organization 's discovery is no cause for alarm , said @entity98 , an official with the @entity42			0
" as of now , there are no concerns in @entity7 or elsewhere about human health , " he said			0
@entity3 public health officials had predicted thursday that some radioactive particles might be detected but predicted that they would pose no danger			1
even before the discovery , some drugstores in @entity3 were running out of potassium iodide , which prevents some of radioactive iodine 's harm to the thyroid			2
public health officials have urged people not to take potassium iodide as a preventive measure			0
it collects in the thyroid , protecting it from absorbing radioactive iodine			2
but it carries its own side effects , especially for people who have allergies to iodine or shellfish , or who have thyroid problems			0
@entity0 's @entity126 and @entity127 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity3 exposure represents 1 millionth the background radiation dose rate
@entity1 cites isotopes and timing for the *conclusion*
@entity52 has found no increase in radiation levels
a trace amount of radioactive material has been detected in @entity46 , @entity3
