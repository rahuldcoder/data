-- @entity1 battled for nearly six hours with @entity2 at the @entity3 , the longest grand slam final in history			1
seemingly on the verge of exiting in the fourth set , @entity1 rallied and then led by a break in the fifth before his @entity10 opponent ultimately had the last word			2
when the bruising slugfest was over , in an unusual move , the players were given chairs during the trophy presentation			0
@entity1 's loss to @entity18 this january in the @entity20 final featured a more routine looking scoreline and lasted a shade over two hours , so nowhere near as tiring -- but the world no. 1 says it was tougher to deal with than the reverse to @entity2			1
that 's because @entity1 hurt his back in the warm - up and was n't able to compete at 100 %			1
the injury , coupled with @entity18 's play , led to the @entity30 claiming his first grand slam title			1
@entity1 was the heavy favorite pre-match , owning a 12 - 0 head - to - head record without dropping a set			1
" it was one of the toughest moments in my career , " @entity1 was quoted as saying by the @entity36 's website thursday at the @entity37			1
" it was tough being there for 90 minutes knowing that you will not win			0
but not winning was not the worst thing			0
the worst thing was knowing i could not compete			0
" when you are losing and competing , that 's part of sport			2
this loss was worse for me than 2012 and the six hours against @entity2			2
i did everything right to be there and compete in the final , and i could n't			2
i do n't know if i would have had the chance to win that match because he was playing amazing			0
" @entity1 admitted it took a while for him to get the loss out of his system			2
" i am a great loser , " he said			0
" normally after a few hours i forget about the losses and look straight to the next thing , but after this tournament it took a little bit more time			0
" the back still not recovered , @entity1 skipped an event in @entity67 last month but returned -- and won -- in @entity68			1
he says the back is now " healthy , " bad news for his opponents in the @entity72 desert			2
it 's @entity1 's most successful hard - court masters tournament , having won in @entity37 three times and only failing to reach the semifinals once			1
last year @entity1 triumphed not long after his comeback from a serious knee injury			1
" it was one of my most special titles , " he said			0
@entity1 faces a tricky draw , however , with @entity18 , @entity82 and @entity83 in his half			1
azarenka uncertain meanwhile in the women 's draw , two - time grand slam champion @entity85 played down her chances after only recently recovering from a foot injury			1
@entity85 was forced to wear a protective boot so the foot could heal			1
" when you hear for the first time from the doctor , ' you 've got to wear a boot for three weeks , ' and the tournament is in four and a half weeks you 're like , ' okay , well , we 'll see how it goes			0
' " what i expect for myself is to fight for every ball			0
the rest is a little bit of an unknown for me right now			0
" the first match is going to happen			0
i 'm going to go out there and i 'm going to play			0
the most important thing for me is that my foot feels good			0
" @entity85 -- a walkover in @entity37 last year after retiring in 2011 -- begins against @entity111 @entity110 .			1

@entity1 says losing the @entity20 final was worse than his six - hour *defeat* in 2012
a back injury hampered the @entity117 and he was beaten in four sets by @entity18
a return to @entity37 *excites* @entity1 since he has won the @entity122 event three times
former champion @entity85 plays down her chances *due* to a foot injury
