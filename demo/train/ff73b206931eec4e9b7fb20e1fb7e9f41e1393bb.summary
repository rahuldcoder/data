-- many expected @entity2 to focus on internal politics in his first year in office and not make major external moves , but in fact @entity6 is busy designing and implementing a bolder foreign policy in light of an anticipated @entity12 decline			1
this strategy was made clear this weekend as @entity14 mapped out airspace over a disputed island chain in the @entity17 and released rules that it says must be followed by all aircraft entering the zone -- under penalty of intervention by @entity6 's military			0
unlike his predecessors , @entity2 is making foreign policy with the mindset of a great power , increasingly probing @entity12 commitments to its allies in the region and exploiting opportunities to change the status quo			1
@entity6 's recent rhetoric and actions show a move from a defensive , reactive , and image - conscious policy to a proactive approach designed to further @entity6 's vital interests			1
officials in @entity6 have begun using new diplomatic language , with decades - old terms sloughed off to allow more room to maneuver			2
traditional mantras like " non-interference " and " hide our capacities and bide our time " are no more under @entity2 , whose new slogan is the " @entity6 dream , " a vision for the national rejuvenation of the @entity6 people			1
and in the @entity12 - @entity6 relationship , @entity12 diplomats used to frame the debate with terms such as " responsible stakeholder " in the global system			1
but @entity6 has now put forth its own catch phrase : a " new type of great power relations , " in which the @entity12 recognizes @entity6 's core interests and respects it as an equal			1
@entity6 's reforms : letting the economy fly more freely @entity6 's actions also demonstrate a more activist external strategy			0
regionally , maritime security interests have taken precedence in @entity6 's strategic rationale			0
even before officially taking power , @entity2 was made head of the maritime small group that presided over @entity14 's swift and decisive response to @entity77 's september 2012 purchase of three disputed islands in the @entity17 from their private owner			0
by declaring territorial baselines around the islands , increasing the number and length of its law enforcement patrols , and introducing military forces in the vicinity , @entity6 has challenged @entity77 's de facto control of the area and moved to solidify its own claims			0
@entity6 's demarcation of a new " @entity92 " , which includes the disputed islands - known as the @entity94 in @entity6 and @entity94 in @entity77 - underscores these goals			2
in the @entity96 , @entity6 has played a double game , calling for the peaceful settlement of disputes through bilateral negotiations and engaging in a wide - ranging charm offensive , while simultaneously trying to gain control of disputed territories			2
the cancellation of president @entity106 's october trip to the region , forced by the @entity12 government shutdown , greatly assisted @entity2 it left him as the star attraction at regional gatherings where @entity12 - @entity6 rivalry features strongly , and @entity2 made the most of the attention by announcing a slew of new deals across @entity117			1
@entity6 initially left the @entity118 out of its largesse to punish it for submitting their maritime dispute to international arbitration and to warn other @entity124 ( @entity124 ) countries against doing the same			0
@entity125 and the @entity126 @entity2 has also acted strongly to protect other interests			0
he swept through @entity125 in september to forge closer trade ties at a time when the @entity12 is disengaging from @entity130 and the region			0
@entity6 has recently splashed cash there to secure access to petroleum resources beyond the reach of the @entity12 navy			1
and @entity6 and @entity138 continue to engage in joint multi-polarity to keep the @entity12 in check while furthering their energy relationship			1
in the @entity126 , where traditionally @entity6 has been content to have the @entity12 play the decisive political role , @entity2 has made moves calibrated to establish a presence without becoming mired in the region 's disputes			1
with @entity6 expected to become even more dependent on oil from the region , @entity14 realizes that instability there could jeopardize supply			0
in may , @entity2 received both @entity153 and @entity154 , issued a ' four point peace plan , ' and offered to host an @entity158 - @entity157 peace summit			2
while the components of the plan are not new and the offer has not been accepted , the initiative showed that as its power and interests grow , @entity6 will act when affected by issues outside its neighborhood			0
@entity167 closer to home , @entity2 has sharply distinguished himself from his predecessor in dealing with @entity167			0
where @entity170 was indulgent , @entity2 has laid down some " house rules , " signing up to sanctions and employing bolder rhetoric against the wayward neighbor			2
but when @entity167 walked back its provocations , @entity2 angered the @entity12 and @entity177 by dispatching vice-president @entity178 to @entity179 to attend a military parade marking the 60th anniversary of the end of the @entity183			2
his presence was a potent symbol , showing that @entity6 's pique over @entity167 's earlier actions did n't preclude @entity14 from trying to repair relations there			0
@entity12 preferences on @entity167 are less and less central to @entity6 's decision - making ; unless the @entity12 takes measures on the @entity192 that @entity6 sees as undermining its regional security			1
@entity2 has also doubled down on involvement in @entity195 , which plays an increasingly important role in @entity6 's energy security and where @entity6 fears that @entity12 engagement efforts are part of a @entity12 strategic encirclement of @entity6			1
taken together , @entity2 's decisions and words illustrate a more active strategy			0
and we are likely to see an even more self - confident @entity6 foreign policy as he continues his decade of rule			1
because @entity2 's domestic agenda and @entity6 's external agenda are intertwined			2
@entity2 's crafting of the " @entity211 " as a vessel for party legitimacy also more closely yokes the party 's fortunes to its performance as a defender of national interests and ambitions			0
and in his pronouncements on ideology , and by establishing a new national security council , @entity2 has made clear that he sees a link between ideological menaces to one - party rule and strategic threats abroad , especially from the @entity12			1
nationalists , especially online , continue to demand that the government use its new - found international heft to more actively and directly defend @entity6 's global interests			0
@entity2 is likely to make efforts to deliver , and in so doing will effectively end the traditional @entity6 policy of non-intervention			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 , director of asia - pacific programs at the @entity238			0
