but the first has to be , how in the world did a 16 - year - old boy survive a five - hour flight in below freezing cold weather at oxygen - depleted heights without dying or falling out of the wheel well of a huge jumbo jet ? another has to be , how does a 16 - year - old even sneak on to an airport and a plane to begin with ? authorities likely were trying to find the answers to some of their questions monday			1
the boy remained in the custody of child welfare services workers in @entity20			1
but the @entity21 says they have no more need to interview the boy as he is no threat			2
apparently he 's just a runaway who popped out of the wheel well of @entity28 45 on sunday to the amazement of the ground crew at the @entity31 on the island of @entity33 -- and triggering a host of questions			1
how did he survive the flight ? as unlikely as it sounds , officials believe the boy rode in a tiny , cramped compartment for almost five hours , at altitudes that reached 38,000 feet , without oxygen and in subzero temperatures			2
" it sounds really incredible , " said aviation expert @entity45			1
" being in a wheel well is like all of a sudden being on top of @entity50			0
" between the oxygen depletion and the cold , life expectancy " is measured in minutes , " @entity45 said			0
but some people have survived			2
since 1947 , 105 people are known to have attempted to fly inside wheel wells on 94 flights worldwide , the @entity59 's @entity58 says			1
of those , 25 made it through , including a 9 - year - old child -- a survival rate of 24 %			1
one of the flights went as high as 39,000 feet			0
two others were at 38,000 feet			0
the conditions at high altitudes can put stowaways in a virtual " hibernative " state , the @entity59 said			1
someone could slip into unconsciousness so that the body cools and " the central nervous system is preserved , " said @entity75 aviation expert @entity74			1
also , he said , " there could be a situation where inside the bay is warmer than the external air temperature and you would n't get the instantaneous freezing of the skin			2
" still , " for somebody to survive multiple hours with that lack of oxygen and that cold is just miraculous , " airline analyst @entity83 told @entity75 affiliate @entity84 in @entity85			0
the boy 's survival is " dumb luck mostly , " says dr. @entity93 , trauma surgeon at @entity95 's @entity94			1
the temperature outside the airplane could have been as low as 75 or 80 degrees below zero , said @entity93 , who is also a pilot			0
" those are astronomically low temperatures to survive			0
" the boy was likely so cold that " he was essentially in a state of suspended animation , " @entity93 said			2
being young likely worked in his favor , too			0
" no adult would have survived that , " @entity93 added			2
the boy could face permanent brain damage from the experience , in fact , it 's " more likely than not , " @entity93 said			1
he could face neurological issues , memory problems or a lower iq			0
when the ground crew at @entity31 noticed the boy , he was wandering the tarmac , dazed and confused			2
the teen also could have frostbite or a kidney injury because when the body freezes , particles of muscle enter the blood stream and damage the kidneys , @entity93 said			2
teen stowaway raises questions about airport security how did he get there ? the 16 - year - old apparently hitched a ride from @entity131 , @entity132 , to @entity33 in the landing - gear wheel well of a @entity135 767 , @entity134 said			1
the boy told authorities he was from @entity138 , @entity132 , and ran away from home sunday morning , said @entity21 special agent @entity140			1
he did n't have an @entity141 and was carrying only a comb			0
he hopped an airport fence , ran to the plane and climbed on , the @entity21 said			2
" it appears that this teenager scaled a section of our perimeter , " @entity146 spokeswoman @entity145 told @entity75			0
the boy " was able to proceed onto our ramp under cover of darkness and enter the wheel well of an aircraft			0
" officials for the city of @entity131 , which operates the airport , are not planning any legal action , @entity145 said monday			1
once they were confident that the teen did not present a threat , the @entity21 dropped out of the investigation			0
the boy is in the custody of child welfare services workers in @entity20 , said @entity168 , a spokeswoman for the state 's @entity169			1
she said monday afternoon that officials have notified the boy 's family that he is safe			1
how did no one notice him ? surveillance camera footage shows the boy hopping the fence at the @entity131 airport , the @entity21 said			1
there 's also camera footage of him walking across the ramp in @entity131 toward the @entity134 aircraft , the airport said			1
video " is under review by federal and local law enforcement officials here , " @entity145 said			0
" and we 'll continue to review that to determine where , in fact , the teenager was able to scale the fence line			0
" the boy told investigators he crawled into the wheel well of the plane and lost consciousness when the plane took off			1
an hour after the plane landed at @entity31 , the boy regained consciousness and emerged to a " dumbfounded " ground crew , the @entity21 's @entity140 said			1
the @entity33 airport has video of him crawling out of the left main gear area			0
" it makes no sense to me , " @entity140 said			0
@entity212 , the @entity213 airport manager , added that a worker saw the boy come out of the wheel well and walk toward the front of the aircraft			0
" clearly there 's a big security breach here , which in the post 9/11 world order is a concern , " said @entity219			1
to get past all sorts of people apparently unnoticed is " a physical feat , " he said			0
5 stowaway attempts that did n't end tragically how did he not get crushed or fall ? it 's not hard at all " to climb inside the wheel well , said @entity229 , a ground operations coordinator at @entity231 's @entity230			1
" you can grab onto the struts and landing gear assembly kind of like a ladder , and you just jump on the tire and climb into the wheel well			1
" inside , there 's not much room -- even less than in the trunk of a car , @entity229 said			0
a stowaway would need to guess " where the tire is going to fold in when it closes after takeoff			0
there 's a high risk of getting crushed once the gear starts going in			1
" during the flight , " the interior guts of the aircraft , they 're pretty exposed inside the wheel well , so there 's a lot of stuff you can hold on to , " @entity229 adds			0
" it 's just a matter of holding on to it for the duration of the flight and maintaining your grip when the gear opens up and not falling out			2
if you fell out , you could get horribly mangled or dragged on the runway			0
" in february , crews at @entity270 in suburban @entity271 found the body of a man inside the landing - gear wheel well of an @entity275 operated by @entity276			2
in 2010 , a 16 - year - old boy died after he fell out of the wheel well of a @entity280 flight that was landing at @entity282 's @entity281			1
the most recent known case of someone surviving was on a short domestic flight in @entity286			0
a 15 - year - old boy snuck into the wheel well of a flight from @entity289 to @entity290 -- thinking it was a flight to the @entity291 , according to an @entity59 report			1
the ride lasted only 35 minutes , and the plane likely went no higher than 25,000 feet			0
the @entity59 and @entity295 have studied stowaway incidents to augment security			1
many incidents involve people desperately trying to escape their countries			0
" no system is 100 % , " said @entity131 airport spokeswoman @entity145			2
boy , 11 , hops plane to @entity304 without ticket or passport boy sneaks onto vegas flight by himself			2

teen apparently traveled from @entity132 to @entity20 in plane 's landing gear
@entity59 says 105 stowaways have made similar attempts since 1947 ; 25 survived
the situation indicates a " big security breach , " aviation expert says
boy is with child welfare services , official says ; @entity131 plans no legal action
