-- @entity1 carefully slipped the beaded satin wedding gown over her small frame			1
she peered at herself in the rusted mirror and cautiously smiled			2
for a moment , her war - torn world was transformed and she was a beautiful bride -- free , safe and happy			1
boom ! a mortar shell exploded somewhere near her @entity8 home in @entity9 , waking her from a daydream			1
she quickly wrapped a white headscarf tightly around her hair and prepared to leave for her wedding			2
only a week earlier , @entity14 met her husband - to - be , @entity15			1
their families had coordinated the introduction			2
he was a pastry chef and part - time fighter for the rebel @entity21 which wants to oust president @entity22			1
she was 18 and from a family who did n't like the @entity22 government			1
they took no lingering looks across the room , and time did n't stand still when their eyes met			2
they simply chatted as @entity8 's nearly 20 - month - old civil war rumbled in the background			1
" i had a feeling in my heart , " @entity15 said , recalling that day			1
" i can not describe it to you			2
" during the interview , a shell boomed in the distance			2
" in a time when we are under siege and there are sounds like this , i told my mother i decided to fulfill half my religion and to get married , " he said , " and without ever even seeing my bride , everything went perfect			2
" we saw each other and we liked each other , " she said , " and in just one week we were married to each other			0
" marriage as revolution @entity9 has borne the brunt of the @entity8 military 's wrath since violence broke out nearly two years ago in the nation			1
many who live in the city consider it to be the unbowed guardian of the @entity8 revolt			1
a massacre in the spring killed scores of women and children			0
there , even marriage is an act of revolution			1
" we must get married			0
our lives must continue , " @entity15 said defiantly			1
" we have not surrendered , and we will not surrender			2
a promise we will keep , @entity80 willing			1
" out of respect for the dead , the couple held a small ceremony in the family apartment rather than a traditional large and noisy @entity8 wedding			1
" it was not appropriate to dance and play music , " @entity15 said			1
" we recently received the body of my martyred brother , and many other families have martyrs as well			0
so it was a small family affair			0
" speaking via @entity95 , the couple seems to have little interest in chatting about romance or the frivolities of weddings			0
instead , both are enthralled with their love for revolution and an ancient country that appears lost to war and strife			2
" i wore a white dress , but we did not have a traditional wedding because of this animal in power , " @entity14 said			0
" we hope once the regime falls we can have a wedding , because our happiness is the end of this government			0
" the couple spent their honeymoon at home , struggling to survive as @entity22 's forces relentlessly shelled @entity9			1
but @entity14 said she is very happy to stay			0
" here , we have our pride and we are defending our nation , " she said			2
" i would prefer my honeymoon to be here amid the bombs and shells then for me to abandon my nation			1
" in the @entity130 , where arranged marriages are common , there is an @entity132 word for love after marriage : " ashra			2
" it means the love from living life together			0
it is emotion based on mutual respect , understanding and a need for a partner to survive all life 's struggles			0
" i am not upset that i got married under these circumstances , " @entity14 said			0
i am proud that i married one of the revolutionaries , and i am proud to be here in old @entity9 defending my nation and my dignity			2
" now , after more than a year and a half of violence , living life amid the constant killing and dying is the greatest form of rebellion for the couple			0
" i took this step , because i am a man who has faith in @entity80 and destiny , " @entity15 said			1
" the days that passed were very hard on us			0
i still thank @entity80 for everything , but i felt something was missing in my life			1
i do not know how to describe it			0
" every day was a struggle , but something was missing			0
" a baker becomes a fighter before the @entity8 civil war turned @entity9 into a conflict zone , @entity15 owned a baked - sweets business , selling cakes and candy to the mainly pro-government @entity181 and @entity182 districts near his native neighborhood in @entity9 ' @entity184			1
" when my brother was killed , i decided to return to my community and support my people , because what was happening was unjust , " he said			0
" seventy percent of my friends have been killed in this and that massacre			0
this is an unbearable level of injustice			0
" @entity195 must be tried for war crimes , he believes			2
@entity15 joined the rebel @entity21 and fought alongside other members of the armed opposition to liberate an opposition enclave in @entity9			1
while the @entity184 remains under siege and constantly sustains shelling and mortar fire , @entity8 troops remain outside the neighborhood , stationed along the outskirts of the suburb			1
" there are enough @entity21 troops to protect us now , but i noticed how difficult the situation is around us , " @entity15 said			1
now , @entity211 spends his days kneading rations of flour and bits of butter into dough , creating sweet , creamy @entity8 desserts			1
" the kids wanted sweets and many of the women were craving desserts , so i am trying to bake sweets again , " he said			0
faithful and not afraid @entity14 said she visits her parents and relatives every day to help with household duties , and she checks on the well - being of her neighbors until the evening , when her new husband returns home			0
" i am not afraid of anything happening to him , and i thank @entity80			1
we are all willing to sacrifice our lives for @entity8 , " @entity232 said			1
" i thank @entity80 above all else			1
" another single loud explosion thundered in the background as they spoke			0
the couple did n't even flinch			0
" i pray no one is hurt " @entity15 calmly said			1
he turned to his wife , who wore a faded purple coat and tight black headscarf			0
" please , go ahead , " he said , kindly signaling her to speak			0
" we will not surrender , @entity80 willing , " she said			1
" we are walking along the righteous path			0
my cousins , my neighbors , the children of my neighbors all died , and many more have lost their lives			2
but i am not sad			0
we will be victorious in this life and the afterlife			0
" @entity14 looks older than her 18 years , and she speaks with impenetrable courage and bravery that generally masks any semblance of a giggling blushing bride only a few weeks into her marriage			2
" we were married september 13 , 2011 , " she said before finally cracking a smile and beginning to laugh			0
" she turns to her husband , blushing and embarrassed			0
he looks down to hide that he is laughing , too , instead mumbling to correct her : " 2012			0
" nothing it seems but sheer faith in @entity80 moves the newlyweds and inspires them to love , and to fight and resist forces in @entity8 they feel must end			1
after nearly every sentence , they defiantly say " @entity276 , " a common @entity275 phrase meaning " i thank @entity80			1
" " my only hope is that this monster will be removed from power so we can live in peace and our children can live in peace , " @entity14 starts			2
" and if not our kids , then the children of our community even if we die , " her husband adds			0

many @entity8 are determined to live their lives despite a war ravaging their nation
@entity1 and @entity15 survived *artillery* shelling during their honeymoon
their marriage is a *symbol* of the resistance against @entity22
" we will not surrender , @entity80 willing , " they say
