-- @entity1 , the former @entity2 star and the first @entity3 known to have met @entity5 leader @entity4 , was in the secretive country again this past week , purportedly to meet his " friend @entity4 , the marshal " and perhaps also , to negotiate for the release of @entity8 , a @entity3 citizen detained since november			1
@entity1 's second trip to @entity5 this year comes months after months of threats of nuclear annihilation from @entity13			1
his desire to help @entity8 is likely to be registered in the annals of diplomatic history as little more than a little diverting adventure			1
the " marshal , " who has actually never served in the military , might choose to act in a statesmanlike manner and release @entity8 after another high - spirited soiree with the basketball legend			0
that would be good news for @entity8 , who is reportedly in poor health			0
other detained @entity3 such a dramatic gesture of goodwill by the reclusive leader would achieve the effect of adding insult to the @entity3 in light of @entity5 's recent cancellation of an invitation to the @entity3 special envoy on @entity5 human rights issues			1
@entity1 , of course , is not qualified to carry out negotiations with @entity5 on sensitive political issues			1
nor does the @entity5 leadership see him as a credible conveyor of official message to @entity44			2
@entity4 's unconventional courting of @entity1 is about equivalent to his enjoyment of @entity48 characters and scantily clad women on stage			1
it 's all jolly and trite pleasure			0
@entity4 's attraction to @entity3 icons such as the @entity2 or @entity54 does not signal a genuine overture to @entity44			1
it does not indicate intentions of reform or opening up of the isolated totalitarian state that imprisons some 1 % of its population in political concentration camps			0
we should never forget that amidst the levity and bonhomie that will emanate from @entity13 in the coming days , @entity5 , throughout more than 60 years of its existence , has committed systematic and widespread attacks on its civilian population , including murder , extermination , enslavement , torture , enforced sexual slavery and disappearance of people			2
in short , these are crimes against humanity			2
but what about the residual effects of personal warmth and brotherhood between @entity4 and @entity1 ? will not such a " cultural encounter " between the @entity5 and the @entity3 lead to a " breakthrough , " as " ping - pong diplomacy " between @entity86 and the @entity3 in 1971 supposedly did ? in 1971 , @entity3 table tennis players were invited to @entity86 for the first time			1
just three months after that unprecedented " cultural exchange , " @entity3 national security adviser @entity89 secretly visited @entity91 , a diplomatic coup that was capped off by president @entity94 's visit to @entity86 the following february			1
lest anyone think that ping - pong diplomacy and @entity86 - @entity3 rapprochement are married by cause and effect and hastily draw the conclusion that @entity1 's latest visit has a fighting chance of bringing about a diplomatic breakthrough between @entity44 and @entity13 , i 'd say : theatrics are not equal to politics			1
@entity8 : please help me the goodwill triggered by ping - pong matches between @entity86 and @entity3 in 1971 was a mood enhancer to the secret contacts between @entity44 and @entity91 that had been underway since september 1970			2
the two countries wanted to discuss geopolitical issues of mutual concern : containing the @entity115 threat , the @entity116 , @entity86 's seat in the @entity118 and @entity119			0
but theatrics are not entirely irrelevant to politics			0
if anything , the young @entity5 leader 's occasional displays of affinity for @entity3 pop culture will only irk the country 's revolutionary old guards			1
@entity4 clearly lacks the gravitas of his late father			2
he may believe that he is exuding an affable image by being seen with an @entity3 star			0
but by traditional @entity5 standards on how a national leader should carry himself , @entity4 comes across as less charismatic than -- dare i say -- a lightweight			2
there is no reason to believe that the @entity5 military would challenge anytime soon			0
@entity4 's hold on power over the party and the military seems , for now , firm			1
but the prospects for a long , happy reign for whom propagandists tout as a demigod are dim			0
with time , @entity4 will come to believe in his own infallibility if not in his omnipotence			0
and megalomania is particularly susceptible to mortal miscalculation , whether on matters of court intrigue or foreign policy			0
in other words , for marshal @entity4 , fantasy is reality			0
and for a ruthless dictator , that 's an invitation to an early brush with mortality			0
if @entity1 unwittingly sows the seeds of reality in the fantastical world of the @entity5 leader by nudging him toward miscalculation and deeper depths of self - absorption or planting doubt in the minds of @entity5 with access to big guns -- then his latest courting of the marshal may rightfully come to be remembered one day , indeed , as a game - changer			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			0

@entity1 was in @entity5 purportedly trying to negotiate release of a @entity3 detainee
@entity179 : in the annals of diplomatic history , this may well be a little blip
he says @entity4 's courting of @entity1 is equivalent to his enjoyment of @entity48
@entity179 : despite displays of theatrics , do *n't* forget @entity5 's crimes against humanity
