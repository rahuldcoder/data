@entity1 's leadership has sent experienced jihadists to @entity3 in an effort to build a fighting force there , according to a @entity3 source briefed by @entity10 counter-terrorism officials			1
the jihadists include one veteran fighter who had been detained in @entity13 on suspicion of terrorism			0
the source describes him as committed to @entity1 's global cause and to attacking @entity18 interests			1
the source told @entity20 that the @entity1 leader , @entity21 , personally dispatched the former @entity13 detainee to @entity3 earlier this year as the @entity24 regime lost control of large swathes of the country			1
the man arrived in @entity3 in may and has since begun recruiting fighters in the eastern region of the country , near the @entity32 border			1
he now has some 200 fighters mobilized , the source added			1
western intelligence agencies are aware of his activities , according to the source			0
@entity37 : rebuilding the ruins of @entity24 another @entity1 operative , of dual @entity41 - @entity3 nationality , was arrested in an unnamed country on his way to @entity3 from the @entity46 - @entity45 border region			1
the individual now trying to establish a bridgehead for @entity1 in @entity3 is known as " @entity49			2
" his name has not been made public because of @entity13 law on terrorist suspects who are detained but not charged			0
" aa " has been close to @entity21 since the 1980s and first traveled to @entity46 in the early 1990s to join mujahideen fighting the @entity55 occupation -- as did hundreds of @entity57 fighters			2
" @entity49 " later moved to the @entity13 , where he began spreading @entity1 's ideology to younger @entity60			1
he was an admirer of @entity62 , who emerged as leader of @entity1 in @entity64 after the @entity18 invasion and who led an especially brutal campaign that targeted civilians and promoted sectarian hatred between @entity70 and @entity60			1
war crimes court leaves @entity24 inquiry up to @entity3 after the terrorist attacks in @entity74 in july 2005 , heightened concern about terrorist activities in the @entity13 led to the arrest of a number of @entity3 resident in @entity80			2
" aa " was detained under what was termed a " control order , " a mechanism used to detain terrorist suspects -- usually under home arrest -- without charging them			0
control orders have been used in dozens of cases where the government does not want to reveal evidence in court for fear of compromising security sources			0
those subject to control orders are not named by authorities			0
" aa " also spent some time in @entity97 high - security jail in the @entity13 in 2006 - 07 , possibly because he was seen as a flight - risk			0
it is also possible , according to the source , that he was resisting legal moves to have him deported to @entity3			2
at the time , relations between the @entity24 regime and the @entity13 were improving , and @entity3 authorities were seeking the deportation of opponents			2
at some point the control order lapsed , and " aa " left @entity13 late in 2009 and went back to the @entity46 - @entity45 border area -- taking two teenagers with him			0
western intelligence agencies have voiced concern in public and privately about the potential for @entity118 extremists and especially @entity1 to gain a foothold in @entity3			2
the @entity1 leadership has included several @entity3 -- among them @entity122 , who was killed in august , and @entity123			1
in a video message to fellow @entity3 distributed on jihadist forums earlier this month , @entity123 said : " at this crossroads you have found yourselves , you either choose a secular regime that pleases the greedy crocodiles of the @entity130 and for them to use it as a means to fulfill their goals , or you take a strong position and establish the religion of @entity135			2
" militant groups have long had a presence in eastern @entity3 , even if they were ruthlessly suppressed by the @entity24 regime			1
@entity1 documents discovered in @entity64 in 2006 showed that many of the fighters who had joined the insurgency had come from eastern @entity3			1
and a @entity18 diplomatic cable from 2008 -- published this year by @entity144 -- told of support for extremist @entity118 views in the town of @entity148 , which is close to where " aa " has established a presence			0
entitled " @entity155 in @entity148 " the cable describes the town as a " wellspring of @entity3 foreign fighters " for @entity1 in @entity64			1
the diplomat who traveled to @entity148 quoted a local businessman who had " likened young men in the town to @entity160 ' character in the action picture ' @entity155 , ' who stubbornly refused to die quietly			0
for them , resistance against coalition forces in @entity64 is an important act of ' jihad ' and a last act of defiance against the @entity24 regime			0
" high youth unemployment , discrimination by the @entity24 regime and the influence of veteran @entity3 jihadists from @entity46 all played a role in radicalizing a new generation			0
" it 's jihad -- it 's our duty , and you 're talking about people who do n't have much else to be proud of , " the businessman said .			0
