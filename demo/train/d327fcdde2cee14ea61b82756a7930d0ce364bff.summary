-- believing that celebrity and success -- even attractiveness -- guarantee immunity from domestic violence is like believing famous people are magically protected from the dangers of other drivers on the road , airborne pathogens from a stranger 's sneeze , or the path of a wild fire			1
domestic violence knows no boundaries , affecting women â € ” and some men â € ” who meet every descriptor of race , age , socioeconomic or educational status , sexual orientation , demography , geography , ideology , disability or theology			1
domestic violence is more common than breast cancer and left - handedness			1
famous or anonymous , one in four women in this country will experience domestic violence in her lifetime , according to the @entity36			1
each year in the @entity38 , 5.3 million women experience domestic violence , at an annual cost to the @entity38 economy of $ 5.8 billion			1
according to the @entity45 's 2011 - 2012 annual report , " this pervasive human rights violation affects all countries and communities			1
" the @entity46 reports that 15 % to 71 % of women ages 15 to 49 in a multicountry study had experienced intimate partner violence			2
notably , nowhere on this planet is there 0 % violence against intimate partners			2
nowhere on this planet is there a society immune to domestic violence			1
and no upscale neighborhood or celebrity - frequented restaurant is off limits			2
so why should the recent public altercation between tv chef @entity62 and her handsome , successful husband , @entity63 , surprise anyone ? in light of tabloid photographs that show @entity68 holding a tearful @entity69 by the neck , it should be clear that intimate partner violence is a universal scourge			1
why does the myth that intimate partner violence exists only in lower socioeconomic communities persist ? @entity63 has not been charged in connection with the incident and has denied his actions were abusive , calling the encounter a " playful tiff			2
" horrified observers reportedly had a different take			0
certainly no one wishes the suffering of violence on anyone regardless of who they are			0
but this alleged incident provides a painful reminder that it is time to permanently dissolve the mythology that domestic violence only happens to low - income women			1
and it is time to take such an outrageous public display of apparent violence seriously			0
shortly after the publication of the photos , @entity97 's @entity96 of the @entity98 tweeted : " if i had the opportunity to squeeze @entity62 , her throat would n't be my first choice			1
" next , he followed up with this : " to feminist cranks whining re my ' objectifying ' @entity62 , she was happy to use her curves to sell books			2
her chorizo & potato soup v good btw			0
" that 's about as funny as referring to a sleeveless tank top as a " wife beater " and thinking that 's ok			0
@entity68 's downplaying of the incident as " playful " to the media is also no surprise			2
as a survivor of domestic violence myself , and an advocate and spokesperson for nonviolence for the past 18 years , i know that sentiment is on par with the common rationalizations for domestic violence i have heard : " she asked for it			1
" @entity63 's comment does not match in scope the most outrageous response i once heard from a police officer about a man who shot his wife : " she ran in front of the bullet			1
" but @entity68 's flippant dismissal matches our universal misunderstanding that domestic violence is not about us			1
it is always about other people somewhere else			0
unfortunately , the sorority of successful and powerful women who have reportedly been victims of domestic violence includes @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159			1
sometimes a batterer is the most charismatic man in the room ; they are lawyers , doctors , politicians , business titans , actors , celebrities , singers and professional athletes			0
i understand ; domestic violence was not something i ever thought would happen to me			2
i married a man i knew my whole life ; he was smart , handsome , kind and ambitious			0
we dated for three years with no hint of violence			0
that changed four months into our marriage			0
at the time , i thought i was powerful and successful enough to change him ; i was not			0
we have been divorced 18 years			0
what i learned is a partner 's behavior is not something you can control , no matter how educated you are , no matter how idyllic your life was growing up , no matter how much you dreamed your life would go well			0
and no matter if you are a vibrant , internationally successful best - selling author and chef			0
though she and her children have moved out of their family home , @entity69 has yet to publicly comment on the situation			0
we do n't know whether she views herself as a victim of domestic violence , but those photographs tell a story we need to keep repeating			1
so many of us who believe the myths of domestic violence do n't tell because we are ashamed to tell			1
we believe as successful women we are immune , that it happens to others			0
millions of women around the globe in all manner of circumstances think they can not say the truth about the violence in their lives because they will die of embarrassment			2
but we all need to remember , in the most severe cases , it is never embarrassment that kills them .			0

celebrity chef @entity62 was photographed with her husband 's hands at her throat
there 's a common *perception* that women with money and means are n't abused
the @entity45 calls domestic violence a " pervasive human rights violation "
@entity228 calls @entity63 's dismissal of the incident " flippant "
