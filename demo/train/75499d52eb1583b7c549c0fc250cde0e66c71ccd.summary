for many families this holiday season , video games will come wrapped in colorful paper , ribbons and bows -- and lots of questions			1
inevitably , in the wake of the tragic school shootings in @entity9 , @entity10 , video games have become part of the national conversation about the roots of violence			1
to be sure , any role they may have played in @entity9 remains unclear			1
police have said nothing about them , and scattered news reports have gunman @entity20 playing games ranging from the military strategy " @entity23 " to kid - friendly " @entity24 , " neither of which rank among the more violent titles on the market			2
and while violent video - game controversies date back to the 1970s , studies into whether games cause violent behavior have been inconclusive			1
for many gamers , it 's an old and tired debate			2
but after the @entity9 shootings , which claimed the lives of 20 children and seven adults -- including @entity20 's mother -- some shoppers are weighing whether it 's appropriate to give certain video games to children or young teens this holiday season			1
@entity43 reached out to ireporters and commenters on the site for their thoughts on the issue			2
" i have two boys , age 9 , that want ' @entity54 , ' " said a @entity43 commenter using the screen name goldeneagle78 , referring to the popular military - shooter game series			0
" they will not be getting it , or any other game that is rated above their age level			0
" reader @entity60 of @entity61 , @entity62 , said she understands that millions play games with no ill effect , but that " for the mentally unstable , these fantasy scenarios are fueling the violence , and being re-enacted in real life			2
" the @entity69 created a ratings system for video games similar to the classification used in movies , such as @entity74 " @entity54 : @entity76 , " like many other games depicting violence , adult language or sexual content , is rated " @entity81 , " or suggested for players 17 and older			1
some readers lumped video games in with other media that depict violence			1
" if they want to ban guns , why not ban them in movies , television and video games ? " asked reader @entity86 in an @entity88 article inviting ideas for halting mass shootings			1
" why do we allow the media and entertainment industries to glorify weapons and killings ? " if we 're going to start regulating and banning weapons , why not start by aggressively banning and preventing the abuse of weapons in media ? " smells added			0
" why do we allow our children and young adults to buy video games that put them in the position of being rewarded for shooting and killing other players ? " commenters repeatedly mentioned the @entity69 's system , saying parents should be as responsible about games their children play as they are about the movies they allow them to see			1
@entity116 , president of @entity118 - based video game chain @entity117 , said part of the confusion around the issue is because some parents and other adults only deal with video games once a year , around @entity125			1
@entity116 said he tries to help uninformed parents get the information they need , including ratings , before choosing gifts			0
but ultimately , he said , parents are responsible for keeping an eye on their kids			0
" i have two young kids myself , " @entity116 said			0
" for any parent to be able to be involved in whatever your kid 's doing , you need to be ( educated )			0
you need to know what those things are			0
" @entity116 said he does n't believe games are responsible for societal violence			2
but he said he thinks the way kids play them can tell parents a lot about possible problems , especially when a child is spending a lot of time alone on the computer			0
" go into their room and see what they 're doing and what they 're into , " @entity116 said			0
" being an active and involved parent is being a good parent			0
" that 's a view echoed by many others			0
" i would not consider buying my child a first - person shooter game , " wrote a reader using the handle dxp2718			0
" my kids , admittedly , are too young to play video games like that , but they could play with toy guns , swords or soldiers if i let them have them -- and i would n't even think of it			1
" not hurting others is lesson # 1			0
it comes before reading , writing , counting or anything else			0
" @entity178 , ceo of gaming and health company @entity179 , said he does n't believe games are to blame			2
but he started a movement , including a hashtag on @entity184 , urging people to give up playing first - person shooter games on friday , december 21 , as a show of sympathy and understanding for the @entity9 victims			1
" it 's not to say that video games are to blame			1
it 's more to show that we as gamers give a damn , " @entity178 said			0
" video games are more so a reflection of real life			1
gaming is an outlet , just like movies and music			2
" @entity43 commenter @entity204 said he hopes people will look deeper for answers			0
he said parents have the most responsibility to teach their kids , especially since they are often the ones buying the games and they cost so much			2
" people blame the video games because it is easier than blaming themselves , but the fact is millions of kids around this country and around the world play the same violent and destructive video games , and yet only a very select few have made the choice to take that violence and killing from the game and bring it into real life , " he said			1
