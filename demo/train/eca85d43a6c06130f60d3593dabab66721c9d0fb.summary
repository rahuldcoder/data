abortion is illegal without exception in the @entity12 country			1
the girl , known only as " @entity14 , " said in an interview that she would have the baby			2

political opponents seized on the president 's comments , creating a national debate on the issue			1
former president @entity29 , who is running for the presidency once again , told @entity31 that abortion should be an option in the case of rape			1
@entity14 is " a girl with her entire life ahead of her and she requires protection , " @entity29 said			0
" that being said , the option of abortion , in this case , for rape , seems to be the right solution			2
" @entity1 said that in the interest of the girl 's health , doctors will consider whether it makes sense to induce a premature birth if it protects @entity14			0
he added , " the life of the mother always comes first , and we are going to protect @entity14 's life with everything medicine has to offer and with the care of the public health system			0
" but some say that an 11 - year - old girl is not mature enough to take care of a child			1
" more than brave , she is a victim and we have to treat her like a victim and we have the protect her , " @entity2 sen. @entity63 said			1
