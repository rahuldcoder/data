-- his @entity2 teammate saw victory snatched from his grasp in heartbreaking fashion earlier in the @entity7 but @entity8 made sure there was to be no repeat on a rain soaked 19th stage friday			1
@entity8 took his courage in his hands to burst clear of the peloton with 13km of the leg from @entity19 du @entity17 to @entity20 and to stay clear , becoming the first @entity21 to win a stage of cycling 's most prestigious race			1
the 26 - year - old was helped by a late crash which disrupted the efforts of the chasing teams with recognized sprinters and left green jersey leader @entity30 on the tarmac			1
yellow jersey holder @entity33 avoided the carnage to maintain his seven minute 10 second advantage over @entity37 of @entity38 in the overall classification with just two days to go			1
it was the first stage win of the @entity41 for @entity2 , who might have thought their luck was out after @entity45 's tearful failure in @entity46 last sunday			2
@entity45 had led until the closing meters before being overhauled by a pack of surging sprinters , but if @entity8 was unnerved by that precedent he did not show it as he attacked on the fourth category @entity52			1
using his noted ability as a time trialist , @entity8 ' advantage stayed at around 20 seconds until the crash at the front of the peloton just inside the three kilometers to go mark			1
his teammate @entity45 took a hefty fall in the incident , the unfortunate @entity62 receiving medical attention at the roadside before cycling to the finish			0
@entity66 could afford to sit up to celebrate his victory , having a seven second advantage over the chasers , who were led by @entity72 @entity71 ahead of two - time stage winner @entity73 of @entity74 in third			2
but he revealed that fear of the same fate befalling him as @entity45 had been his motivation			0
" i did n't know what was happening back there , " he told gathered reporters			0
" i was thinking that maybe the sprinters ' teams would chase me down			0
" i 've no idea what happened , i just went as fast as i can , i kept my speed up and hoped that what happened to @entity45 would n't happen to me			0
" until the last 10 meters i was afraid to turn back			0
i went as fast as i can so at the end i could n't say that i could have done better			0
i went with all my power and at the end i had nothing left in my legs			0
" saturday will see the final major test of an eventful tour , a 54km individual time trial from @entity20 to @entity97			2
@entity33 's advantage leaves him in a comfortable position , but the real battle will be for the other podium places with @entity102 , fellow @entity38 @entity103 and fourth - placed @entity104 of @entity105 separated by just 15 seconds			2
sprint specialists such as @entity107 , @entity73 and @entity30 will get one final chance of a stage win with the traditional finale on the @entity111 in @entity112 sunday with @entity33 set to be crowned @entity7 champion for the first time barring disasters .			1
