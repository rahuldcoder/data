@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 called off an attempt to put a satellite in orbit on thursday , the latest setback to a program that has suffered failures in the past			1
the launch of the @entity12 rocket was suspended minutes before takeoff at a launch site on the country 's southern coast thursday afternoon local time			0
an inspection found problems with the electronic signal in part of the rocket 's mechanism , said @entity24 , a vice minister for education , science and technology			1
additional time is needed to find out the reason behind the problem , he said			0
analysts say the planned launch could rile the country 's hostile neighbor , @entity34 , which carried out a botched launch in april for which it was widely criticized			1
@entity34 's secretive , nuclear - armed regime said its rocket , which broke apart soon after takeoff , was also meant to put a satellite in orbit			2
but the @entity42 and other countries called it a cover for testing ballistic missile technology			0
the @entity47 condemned the launch			0
@entity1 authorities say their latest launch efforts are a crucial step for the development of the country 's civilian space program			1
the satellite carried by the launch vehicle is mainly intended for gathering climate data , they say			0
the @entity1 launch plan is different from that of the @entity34 because it is more transparent , is clearly focused on civilian applications and does n't contravene @entity47 sanctions , according to @entity63 , an international relations professor at @entity64 in @entity0			1
despite that , @entity34 is likely to " insist that a @entity1 rocket launch should also be resisted by the international community , " @entity63 said			1
@entity34 's state - run @entity68 has not published any reports so far mentioning the planned @entity1 launch			1
the development of the @entity1 rocket program , using @entity74 technology for the first - stage launcher , began in 2002			2
previous launch attempts in 2009 and 2010 failed			1
and this launch was originally scheduled to take place last month before being postponed at the last minute			0
@entity0 is aiming to develop its own thruster by 2021 through a program estimated to cost 1.5 trillion won ( about $ 1.4 billion )			1
a successful launch would put @entity1 among the small group of nations that have sent a rocket into space from their own soil			2
others include the @entity42 , @entity74 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			0
recent satellite imagery suggests @entity34 has n't given up on its own rocket ambitions			0
the image , released by the company @entity98 , showed increased activity at the @entity34 's @entity100 on the country 's west coast			0
the company 's analysis of the image , which showed similar preparations to those observed ahead the failed satellite launch in april , raised the possibility of a new launch in the next few weeks			0
but while the @entity42 government has observed activity at the @entity34 site , it does not believe a launch is imminent , according to @entity42 military sources .			2

new : the launch is postponed after an electronic signal problem
previous launch attempts by @entity1 failed in 2009 and 2010
@entity0 says it is trying to develop its own civilian space program
the planned launch may provoke a *reaction* from @entity34
