@entity0 -- @entity3 prime minister @entity2 insisted saturday that @entity3 is a safe bet for investors , a day after the country 's credit rating was downgraded by a ratings agency amid concerns over debt and low growth			1
@entity3 was among nine euro area countries to be downgraded by @entity13 , losing its aaa rating in the process			1
@entity16 also had its top - tier credit rating lowered by one notch to @entity19 +			1
speaking in @entity0 , @entity2 sought to reassure the international markets			2
" @entity3 is a safe country , a country which investors can trust and have confidence in			1
the rating agencies are useful barometers , but they are not the ones who make @entity3 's policies , " he said			1
" @entity3 's rating remains one of the highest in the world			1
" he also cautioned against politicians making too much of the downgrade -- which had been widely anticipated after @entity35 put 15 members of the euro currency bloc , @entity3 among them , on review last month			1
" this decision constitutes a warning that must be neither dramatized nor underestimated , " @entity2 said			1
" those who dramatize the situation should think twice : these are indeed the same people who refused to vote on reforms to strengthen our competitiveness and to reduce deficits , whether that be downsizing the public sector or the pension reform			0
" the downgrade may be seen as bad news for the government ahead of the country 's presidential election in april			2
president @entity56 of the @entity58 party is bidding for re-election , with socialist @entity60 considered his chief rival			0
" everyone needs to remain calm and remember their responsibilities , " @entity2 said			2
" the government remembers its responsibility and is pursuing the strategy agreed on with the president			0
" @entity69 , @entity70 , the @entity71 and @entity72 all maintained their aaa ratings			0
but @entity35 cut the ratings of @entity3 , @entity16 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 by one notch			1
@entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 were cut by two notches			2
@entity35 warned that most governments in the single currency euro area are at risk of further downgrades given the risk of a " more adverse economic and financial environment			1
" the agency said a deeper - than - expected recession in the eurozone would put further stress on government finances			2
in addition , governments remain vulnerable to further turmoil in the bond market , which could drive up their borrowing costs			0
nonetheless , @entity35 said it welcomed recent moves by the @entity102 to help prevent a credit crisis in the banking system			0
@entity69 chancellor @entity105 said saturday that @entity106 still has a long road ahead to restore investor confidence			0
but , she said in a statement , the right steps have been taken , and measures to cut debt and remove obstacles to growth will soon lead to greater stability for euro zone nations			0
@entity118 stocks finished in the red friday as investors braced for the impending downgrades			0
the news came at the end of a week in which solid demand at debt auctions in @entity80 and @entity81 had calmed some nerves , however , and eased borrowing costs for those two governments			0
@entity1 's @entity129 and @entity130 contributed to this report .			0
