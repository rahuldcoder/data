@entity0 , @entity1 -- the man who shot and killed two @entity6 troops in @entity1 was a recently radicalized @entity7 who seems to have been influenced by local radical @entity10 websites , a @entity1 official said thursday			1
@entity11 told interrogators that his aim was to kill @entity6 troops , said @entity15 , interior minister of the @entity1 state of @entity17 , where the shooting took place			1
two @entity6 airmen were killed and two others were wounded in the attack wednesday on a @entity6 military bus at @entity25 , authorities say			1
the 21 - year - old man said he was motivated to carry out the attack after seeing a video on the internet the day before , which he claimed showed @entity6 soldiers raping @entity7 women , according to a @entity1 intelligence official who viewed a record of the suspect 's interrogation			1
the suspect confessed to the shooting , and said that he acted alone with no helpers , the @entity1 intelligence official told @entity2 on thursday			1
he was friends on @entity40 with several pro-al @entity42 extremists from a group based in @entity44 , @entity1 , that is known to @entity1 intelligence officials , according to the official			1
that included links to an @entity50 preacher named @entity51 and someone named @entity53 , who was arrested about two months ago in @entity54 , according to a @entity6 official with direct knowledge of the investigation			1
current indications are that the suspect radicalized quickly , the @entity1 official said			1
the gunman was a postal worker at the airport , but worked outside the secure area			0
the @entity6 official said that @entity11 did n't appear to punch into work wednesday -- having apparently canvassed the area beforehand , helping him get around the extensive uniformed and plain - clothes security that typically patrol the @entity0 airport			1
another @entity6 official on thursday said that @entity11 was " not on the radar screen " of @entity6 authorities prior to the attack			1
the suspect is from the northern town of @entity74 , @entity76 's interior minister , @entity75 , told @entity2 , citing the @entity77 in @entity78 as his source			2
the @entity6 official with knowledge of the probe said @entity11 was a 1 - year - old toddler when he moved to @entity1 , and that authorities believe @entity11 's relatives had suffered in the 1990s during the @entity84 crackdown on ethnic @entity85			1
he has passports from both @entity1 and @entity89 , the latter of which was issued prior to @entity76 's declaration of independence from @entity84 in 2008 , @entity75 said			2
@entity11 told interrogators that he lived with his family in high - rise public housing in a poor area of @entity0 , the @entity1 intelligence official said			1
he said he did not have a friendly relationship with people in the neighborhood and did not interact with others there			0
he said his father was very strict and harsh with him , according to the official			0
on wednesday , he allegedly approached a bus , which was parked outside @entity105 and was clearly marked as a @entity6 military vehicle , @entity1 police said after the shooting			1
according to a @entity6 official , the suspect approached one troop on the curb outside and asked him for a cigarette , only to be rebuffed			1
he then boarded the vehicle and shot over several rows of backpacks and luggage at troops in the back of the bus			0
at some point the weapon jammed and the suspect fled , the @entity1 official said			1
he made it into the terminal , where he was taken into custody by @entity1 federal police , according to police			2
the weapon was a 9 mm handgun that was illegally purchased , @entity15 said			0
the bus was occupied by 15 members of the security forces team that was on its way to @entity135 in @entity1 before deploying to @entity54 , the spokesman said			2
one of the dead airmen was a vehicle operator at @entity135 , and the second was part of a security forces team based in the @entity143 , an @entity137 spokesman said			0
@entity145 was one of those killed , his grandfather , @entity144 , told @entity2			2
it 's not clear if he was the vehicle operator or the member of the security forces team			0
a statement from his family described @entity144 as a hockey player and " @entity156 brat " with especially strong roots in @entity158 in @entity159 who joined the @entity137 in 2009 after a year at @entity161			0
the @entity162 on thursday identified the other victim as senior airman @entity164 , 25 , of @entity165 , @entity166			1
he had been assigned to the 48th @entity167 based out of the @entity169 air base in @entity170			0
the two wounded troops were in a @entity0 hospital , one in critical condition and the other in serious condition , an @entity137 spokesman said			0
these two were security forces who were on their way to a deployment , said a source , who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the incident			0
@entity6 president @entity184 told reporters wednesday he was " saddened and outraged " by the attack			2
" we will spare no effort in learning how this outrageous attack took place , " he said			0
@entity1 chancellor @entity191 said how upset she was by the incident , expressed her condolences to the troops ' families and stressed that @entity1 will " do everything we can to try and find out quickly what happened			2
" @entity199 agents were on the scene shortly after the shooting occurred , said @entity202 , a former @entity199 assistant director and @entity2 contributor			0
the @entity199 's main office in @entity1 is in the capital @entity205 , he said , but it has a sub-office in @entity0			0
the offense is a federal crime both in the @entity6 and in @entity1 , he said , and could be prosecuted in either location , although that will be determined later			2
however , the investigation will meet @entity6 constitutional standards , he said			0
authorities will be investigating the suspect 's background and associates , likely subpoenaing telephone and e-mail records , @entity202 said			0
