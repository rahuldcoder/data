-- a young emperor penguin discovered thousands of kilometers away from its home might survive ingesting a bellyful of sand , @entity2 zoo officials said			1
the penguin -- whose gender is unknown pending dna test results due this week -- stunned passers - by when it showed up at a beach north of @entity16 last week			2
" this is only the second time an emperor penguin has been seen in @entity2 , " said @entity17 , spokeswoman for the @entity18 , where the bird was taken for treatment			1
even more surprising was what the zoo found inside the penguin -- enough sand to fill its stomach to its esophagus			1
" in @entity30 , they normally eat ice to cool down and to hydrate , " @entity17 said			0
it 's possible the bird mistook or tried to substitute the sand for snow or ice			1
it 's unclear why the bird apparently swam more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,864 miles ) from @entity30			1
@entity2 have dubbed the penguin " @entity39 , " a reference to the 2006 animated movie about emperor penguins			1
but those at the @entity18 are steering clear of giving the bird a name			1
" we get very fond of our patients			0
if you start naming them , it 's really hard if the worst were to happen , " said dr. @entity48 , manager of veterinary science at @entity18			2
" we 'll try to avoid ( naming ) until we 're really happy he 's going to make it			2
" the bird has undergone two stomach flushes , but getting all the sand out remains a challenge , @entity48 said			1
" having sand in your stomach is very serious , " she said			2
" it can cause a rupture , that 's my main concern			0
... i would assume the sand has abraded the stomach lining			2
" the emperor had a " rest day " from procedures sunday and will undergo an endoscopy on monday , @entity17 said			0
the zoo currently has four little blue penguins , which are native in @entity2 , @entity17 said			1
all have been rehabilitated ; one is missing an eye , and one is missing a flipper			0
but taking care of an emperor penguin is an entirely different story			1
the bird 's temporary quarters include air conditioning set as cold as possible and shaved ice to keep the emperor cool			1
@entity48 said the top priority is helping the bird recover			0
if all goes well , the @entity85 will decide where the penguin should go			0
in the meantime , the bird has garnered widespread attention and sympathy			0
" i think people have a real soft spot for penguins , " @entity48 said			0
" everyone feels really sorry for him			0
he 's just so lost			0
" @entity0 's @entity95 contributed to this report .			0
