-- reality programs have long featured contestants of color in their casts			1
competition shows like " @entity6 , " " @entity7 " and " @entity8 " have featured diverse contestants since their inaugural seasons in 2001 , 2004 and 2005 , respectively			1
but while african - americans , @entity12 and @entity13 can be seen racing around the world , losing weight and dancing the paso doble on tv , dating shows continue to be far less inclusive			1
two @entity21 - @entity20 men filed a class action lawsuit in @entity23 on wednesday , accusing @entity24 as well as other companies involved with the production of " @entity27 " and " @entity28 " and creator @entity29 of racial discrimination			1
the complaint alleges that , in 16 seasons of " @entity27 " and seven seasons of " @entity28 " ( the eighth season is slated to begin airing in may ) , the defendants have never featured " a single person of color ... in the central role			1
" the suit also alleges that the few people of color who have been chosen to compete are often eliminated after the first few rose ceremonies			1
it should be noted that @entity46 - born @entity45 won season 6 of " the bachelor , " and @entity50 @entity49 won season 6 of " @entity28			1
" but even " @entity27 's " short - lived competition -- like " @entity54 , " " @entity55 " and " @entity56 " -- featured predominately white casts			1
so why does it seem like dating shows might be behind the curve when it comes to inclusion ? @entity63 - based plaintiffs @entity64 and @entity65 assert in their complaint that : " ' @entity8 ' and ' @entity67 ' only involve platonic , as opposed to romantic , relationships among the cast members			1
this indicates that the presence of people of color in @entity24 programming is acceptable so long as there is no exhibition of actual romance between non-whites or whites and people of color			1
" the lawsuit has helped stoke a conversation about diversity and dating shows , especially when it comes to black - white relationships			1
@entity88 , a senior writer at @entity89 / @entity90 , said the men who filed suit may be on to something			0
" when it comes to romance and love , i just do n't think african - americans ... are viewed as people who love or know how to love , " @entity88 said			0
" we 're made to be people who are not interesting or attractive ... and ca n't have that fairytale			0
" young minority viewers might end up watching a show like " the bachelor " and thinking , ' i 'm not good enough to get on this show , but i 'm good enough to get on the show where i can beat somebody up and fight all day long , ' like " @entity103 " or " @entity104 , " she said			1
" @entity27 " has set the tone for how women and people of color are portrayed on every dating show -- on network tv and cable , alike , said @entity118 , the author of @entity119			1
and for a decade , " [ @entity24 and creator @entity125 ] have done everything they can to create an on - screen @entity20 that looks like the segregated @entity127 in the ' 50s , " @entity118 said , adding , " it 's as if [ the network ] is afraid they could lose advertisers by showing interracial dating			0
" calling " the bachelor " " light and fluffy entertainment , " @entity130 , a senior editor at @entity131 , said , producers are " probably not interested in getting their hands dirty in some kind of interracial romance			1
" the show has always featured a bunch of " white girls fighting over a white guy , " @entity130 said			1
" that 's what the viewers , i guess , expect and what the advertisers , i guess , expect			0
... a lot of people a still are against mixed - race marriages			0
" according to data from 2008 and published in @entity153 last year , white women who were surveyed are more likely to approve of interracial relationships for others than themselves , while white men are more likely to personally engage in such relationships			1
people are increasingly becoming more accepting of interracial relationships , @entity88 said			2
but tv does n't " push black - on - black love , so why would [ viewers ] want to see black - on - white love			0
it 's taken a lawsuit to make people talk about this , but i 'm not perplexed			2
" @entity168 ­ a , the managing editor at @entity170 , said he is surprised " @entity27 's " alleged whitewashing is just now being widely criticized			0
" i 'm surprised that someone like @entity29 did n't at least see the revenue potential of expanding the cast , " @entity172 said			0
" why would n't you feature a successful @entity21 - @entity20 man or woman ? " not to mention the fact that " a meaningful multicultural dating show ... would more closely reflect modern interaction , " he added			0
however , @entity172 said , one lawsuit ca n't immediately change the dynamic of such a long - running program			2
" it would take a re-engineering of the show 's thought process to make inclusiveness part of the culture of that program , " he said			0
" if the plaintiffs win and you see an @entity195 , would there be a stigma associated with her ? she 's only there because the lawsuit said she had to be there			2
" it 's too soon to tell how the lawsuit might effect impending seasons of the dating show			2
but lawsuit or not , @entity205 hopes to be wielding roses in the near future			2
the @entity210 - based sportscaster has been petitioning to become the first black bachelor			2
this is n't the first time the issue of diversity has been raised regarding " @entity27			0
" in march 2011 , creator @entity29 told @entity217 : " i think @entity218 [ @entity219 ] is 1/16th @entity220 , but i can not confirm			0
but that is my suspicion ! we really tried , but sometimes we feel guilty of tokenism			0
oh , we have to wedge @entity21 - @entity20 chicks in there ! we always want to cast for ethnic diversity , it 's just that for whatever reason , they do n't come forward			0
" " i 'll take tokenism if it 's going to get one person a job , " @entity88 said , referencing @entity29 ' quote			2
" the point now is that not even that one person is on there			0
