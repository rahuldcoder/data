a note that was " threatening in nature " was found near where her 17 - year - old daughter discovered her lying unconscious in the dining area of her home in @entity0 in @entity22 last wednesday , @entity16 said			1
@entity16 would not specify what the note said ; the daughter said it told the family to go back to @entity7 and called them " terrorists			1

" the possibility that this is a hate crime is just one aspect of what we are examining			2
" although the investigation is " still in the early stages " and police " have not drawn any conclusions , " @entity16 did say evidence leads them to " strongly believe that this was an isolated incident			1
" the chief would not describe that evidence			1
detectives obtained a search warrant for the family 's home because a court order is " just the best way to recover evidence , " @entity16 said			2
the daughter , @entity53 , told @entity2 affiliate @entity54 that a similar note was left outside the family home earlier in the month , but the family did not report it			2
" a week ago they left a letter saying , ' this is our country , not yours , you terrorists , ' " she said			0

and so the day they hurt her , they left it again and it said the same thing			0

@entity11 and her husband have three daughters and two sons , ranging in age from 8 to 17 , @entity74 said			1
@entity53 said nothing was stolen from the house , leading her to believe the attack on her mother was motivated by hate			2
" why did you take my mother away from me ? you took my best friend away from me , " she said , choking with tears , in an interview with @entity2 affiliate @entity97			0
" why ? why did you do it ? i want to know			0
" social media users quickly compared @entity11 's death to that of 17 - year - old @entity102 , calling both hate crimes , and drawing a parallel between a hijab and a hoodie			1
@entity102 was killed last month as he walked back to the house of his father 's fiancee in @entity111 , @entity112 , after a trip to the convenience store			0
police say he was shot by @entity116 , a neighborhood watch volunteer who said he was acting in self - defense and has not been charged			2
