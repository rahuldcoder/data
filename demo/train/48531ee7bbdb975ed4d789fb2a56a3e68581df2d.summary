-- it 's been called the fourth " r " of education : reading , writing , arithmetic and now , aerobics			1
but the gym class of generation @entity8 is n't the same one you probably remember from school			2
" you hear sometimes the old stories ... where you roll the ball out and students just played the game , " says @entity10 , president of the @entity11			1
" that 's not what physical education is about today			1
" as they struggle to keep kids active in the midst of an obesity epidemic , @entity19 teachers are using technology and the latest fitness trends to inspire even the most nonathletic children to develop a lifelong love for exercise			1
" if you do n't have health , what do you have ? " @entity10 asks			2
" you 've got to make sure ( students ) understand how to take care of their body			1
" fighting an epidemic stop me if you 've heard these statistics before : approximately 17 % of @entity36 age 2 to 19 years old are obese			2
though recent studies have shown signs of progress , an estimated one out of every eight preschoolers in the @entity36 is still obese , according to the @entity41			2
and only 25 % of adolescents between the ages of 12 and 15 met the national fitness recommendation of 60 minutes of moderate - to - vigorous physical activity daily in 2012			1
@entity19 teachers have struggled to fight the effects of childhood obesity in class , says @entity10 ; many children 's motor skills are not where they should be and cardiovascular endurance is a big problem			1
and frankly , in general , " kids are lazier , " says @entity54 , a pe teacher at @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity57			2
" they do n't want to work			2
they do n't want to do anything			0
" not just flag football anymore in his 28 years as an educator , @entity54 has seen a significant shift in the kinds of activities taught in gym classes			0
just a decade ago , he says , the focus was 95 % on team sports			0
now teachers are incorporating golf , rock climbing , bowling and even ping - pong into their curriculum			1
" i 'm trying to find that environment where they can find that one lifelong activity , " says @entity75 , a pe teacher at @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity78			0
" all those different things that kids can kind of be engaged in and enjoy			0
" is yoga too religious for schools ? while kids in @entity89 's district tend to be more active than the average @entity36 middle schooler , he sees another troubling trend : students who are spending 10 to 12 months of the year playing only one sport			1
while that 's great for physical fitness , he says , orthopedic surgeons are seeing an increase in children 's sports injuries related to such repetitive motions			1
both @entity54 and @entity75 offer students at their respective schools a choice every day : they can play volleyball or do yoga ; they can practice archery or work out in the weight room			1
all these and more are offered to encourage students to move			1
" the participation level has skyrocketed because they have more options , " @entity54 says			0
we have hardly any complaints like we used to			0
" technology if there 's one thing @entity75 is pumped about , it 's using technology in his class			0
the self - proclaimed @entity127 fanatic has reached out to @entity19 teachers all over the world to bring new ideas to his students			1
@entity75 's class uses @entity133 to analyze their archery or free throw techniques			0
with an app called @entity137 , they record videos of their shot , then play it back while discussing their form			0
@entity75 has also split his class into groups to create their very own workout videos -- recording these at home is easier for some students than performing live in front of their peers , he says			1
many schools provide pedometers and heart rate monitors for students , @entity10 says			1
when she taught elementary @entity19 , she encouraged her students to increase the number of steps they took during every class			1
" you 'd see their little feet moving while we 're giving instructions because they want to get more steps , " she says with a laugh			0
@entity75 has taken technology even further , using it to connect his students with others across the globe			1
in one instance he teamed up with a pe teacher in the @entity172 to pull off an international dance team competition via @entity174			0
another time , his students gave jump rope lessons to their peers abroad			2
" sometimes for phys ed , you just need to get out of the gym , " @entity75 says			0
stress perhaps one of the biggest differences @entity10 sees in students today is high levels of stress			1
an overemphasis on standardized tests and budget cuts has removed important stress outlets such as art class and @entity19 in some schools , she says			1
a few districts in @entity192 have even cut recess for elementary school			0
" that 's so not in line with brain research and what science tells us about a child 's learning ( process ) , " @entity10 says			0
" in reality there needs to be a balance and a respect for the whole child			0
" why kids need recess some schools are getting the message that stress reduction is an important part of a child 's overall well - being			1
they 're incorporating yoga and meditation , @entity54 says , while educating the mind , body and spirit			2
in health class at @entity55 , students are offered the opportunity to use apps like @entity225 , which provides a soothing screen and sounds in timed blocks to calm the mind			2
