in the climactic final battle in the 1986 movie " @entity3 , " an officer tells @entity5 , the battle commander , that the aircraft carrier 's catapults are broken and it 's unable to launch planes			1
@entity5 asks how long a fix will take			0
" it 'll take 10 minutes , " the officer replies			0
" bull --- - 10 minutes ! this thing will be over in two minutes ! get on it ! " @entity5 says			0
fast - forward to 2015 , and the fate of the carrier in " @entity3 " is in similar peril			1
the @entity19 , decommissioned by the @entity20 in 1993 , is scheduled to be towed from storage in @entity22 , @entity23 , to a wrecking yard in @entity25 in about a month			1
coming in with a bid to save it is @entity27 of @entity28 , which hopes to stop the carrier 's final journey in the @entity32 port city , with hopes to turn it into a tourist and business destination			1
" right now , we just want a stay of execution , " @entity37 , project manager for the @entity28 rescue effort , said in a statement on a @entity41 petition to save the carrier			1
" this is our last chance to stop the loss of an irreplaceable cultural and historic asset			0
" that chance appears to be slim			0
in december , the @entity20 paid @entity51 of @entity52 , @entity25 , a penny to take the 56,000 - ton warship off its hands			2
the shipbreaker makes its profit by selling the parts of the ship for scrap			0
although the ranger was decommissioned in 1993 , the @entity20 kept it around for possible reactivation until march 2004 , when it was stricken from the @entity63 and made available for donation to a group that could preserve it			1
an attempt by the @entity68 to turn the carrier into a museum in @entity71 fell short financially , and it could not figure out a way to get the huge ship up the @entity74 to @entity75 , @entity71 , according to a @entity20 statement			1
when it finalized the contract to scrap the @entity19 in december , the @entity20 said it could not afford to maintain it indefinitely while waiting for a suitable organization to take it over			1
@entity37 said the @entity3 group will cover all costs to keep the @entity19 from the scrapyard			1
" sparing the ship now presents no financial risk to the federal government , " he said in a statement			0
the group says it has secured $ 14 million in donations so far and will cover the $ 200,000 in annual maintenance costs until a permanent berth for the ship is found , according to a story in the @entity92			0
but @entity93 , a spokesman for @entity94 , which was responsible for disposing of the carrier , told the @entity96 that the @entity3 plan would n't pass muster			1
" we can not take private funding for inherently military purposes , so it 's not accurate when the group says it can raise funds to keep the ship on donation hold , " the @entity96 quoted @entity93 as saying			2
so unless another plan comes together quickly , the @entity19 is likely to follow two of its predecessors in the @entity109 class of carriers -- the @entity109 and the @entity111 -- to scrapyards in @entity52			2
another carrier , the @entity114 , part of the @entity117 class , was towed to @entity52 late last year			0
like the @entity19 , the @entity118 was stored in @entity23 and because of its size had to be towed all the way around the southern tip of @entity122 , as it would not fit through the @entity123			2
the ranger 's final journey is expected to take four to five months , the @entity20 says			2
the ranger spent more than 35 years on active service , including missions off @entity129 and in support of @entity131 .			0

the @entity19 was *featured* in the 1986 movie " @entity3 "
the @entity20 decommissioned the aircraft carrier in 1993 , and it 's scheduled to be scrapped
@entity27 of @entity28 , @entity32 , hopes to turn it into a tourist and business destination
