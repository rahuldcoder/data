@entity0 " we 'll be back " banners and posters proclaimed on the 75th and final day of the pro-democracy protests that have upended @entity0			1
whether that 's a threat or a wan hope depends on who you ask right now			1
the students that formed the " @entity11 " -- named for the humble umbrella used to protect against tear gas and pepper spray -- are morose but defiant , and more alienated than ever			1
pro-government supporters have transformed from being rather passionless parrots of the @entity18 line into fire - breathing zealots demanding @entity0 police bash the heads of anyone stepping into the streets			1
emotions are clearly raw , and probably will continue to be into 2015			1
the " @entity26 " protests make the upcoming annual policy address by the city 's leader , chief executive @entity28 , in mid january the most critical since @entity0 reunified with @entity30 in 1997			1
continuing to stand firm and largely ignore protesters wo n't fix the sources of so much " turmoil " -- a term associated with the 1989 @entity37 massacre and controversially used in the @entity39 's headline on @entity26 's ending			1
the governments in @entity0 and @entity18 must demonstrate clear understanding of what drove so many to protest so long			1
unless the diagnosis is correct , prescriptions of " medicines " will do more harm than good			1
@entity48 : @entity0 protesters bid camp farewell demand to be heard demands for democracy are in reality demands to be heard			1
@entity28 must show he listens to everyone , that he cares , and that he will take action — decisive , but fair action			1
and that 's the rub			2
research shows one crucial value — belief in a level playing field — has become deeply damaged			2
@entity65 once widely believed with hard work , some sacrifice and good education , anyone could improve their circumstances and achieve a good livelihood			2
tycoons like @entity70 were adulated because they started with nothing and worked their way up			2
today many fewer than before think hard work , sacrifice and good education can lead to better lives			2
indeed , many more believe government policy - making is unfair			2
as proof this is one major cause of unrest , the protest movement caught fire when local government officials refused to meet students demanding to be heard			1
instead , they escorted 70 of the richest @entity65 to @entity18 for private audiences with national leaders			1
talking with students , on the other hand , helped to reduce numbers of protestors			2
they demanded fair treatment , equal to that given the tycoons			2
the promise of a new platform for exchanging views with youth must be fleshed out in the address			2
@entity28 needs to schedule regular question and answer sessions with students like he already does with the city 's chambers of commerce			0
until those presently excluded from consultation are included , the belief the city 's leader unfairly heeds business interests over everyone else will continue to undermine government legitimacy			0
causes of unrest other fundamental causes of unrest stem from unintended consequences of previous decisions			0
a 2010 policy decision privatizing commercial space in public housing estates removed cheap rental access for younger and poorer entrepreneurs making @entity0 's tycoon - dominated crony capitalism even tougher to break through			1
a real competition policy with teeth that makes sure tycoons compete equally with everyone else for business is essential			0
rationalizing the hodgepodge of retirement ages and pension provisions into something simplified , consistent and fair is a must			0
many youth resent being unfairly burdened with aging family members , and government shows very little awareness or sense of urgency			0
a proposal this year to extend the retirement age for civil servants to 65 prompted demands from unions to raise it immediately			0
people must be truly desperate			0
elsewhere , proposing to raise the retirement age sparks protests			0
here , it sparks demands for immediate implementation			0
people do n't want handouts ; they want fair treatment , whatever their age			0
another source of unrest is the sheer press of numbers on our limited space			0
i strongly supported the decision to finally extend easier entry for mainland @entity30 visitors in 2003			0
however , from a too low number of 8.5 million mainland tourists arriving in 2003 , we now very likely have too many for our infrastructure to handle			0
with 40.7 million mainland @entity30 visitors , we are likely hitting capacity			0
chauffeured cars @entity0 needs central and local government officials who understand life 's daily pressures and stress points			1
perhaps @entity0 should imitate what president @entity178 's anti-corruption policies have unleashed on the mainland : officials getting out of their chauffeured cars , giving up their maid service and joining the rest of us standing in long lines			1
it would only be fair			0
and that is why @entity26 demanded that the next election for the city chief executive be fair			0
everything else is not ; and the tycoons and top officials do n't get it			0
until they do , @entity26 's promise / threat of " we 'll be back " is probably right .			1

the main pro-democracy protest camp was cleared on *thursday*
banners and posters proclaimed " we 'll be back , "
@entity0 and @entity18 need to understand why so many demonstrated
