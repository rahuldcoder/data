-- @entity2 's orphanages have become targets for people desperate for food , water and medical supplies in the aftermath of the devastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake			1
on wednesday night , @entity11 , an orphanage caring for 50 orphans , came under attack from a group of 20 armed men , aid workers told the @entity18			1
a neighboring orphanage sheltering about 135 children has been robbed several times over the past few days , they said			0
meanwhile , aid workers said a third orphanage caring for 17 orphans reported that townspeople are trespassing and tapping into the water supply that is reserved for the children			1
" it was calm at first , but the situation is getting more desperate , " said @entity28 , pastor at @entity29 , the nonprofit that oversees @entity11			2
no shots were fired in the attack on the orphanage , and security guards were able to drive off the marauders , he said			2
but one orphanage worker was hit in the head with a rock , he said			0
" if people think you have food , then they will come after it , " @entity28 said			2
the orphanage is rationing what food and water it does have , he said			2
@entity2 is the poorest nation in the @entity48 , and experienced high rates of poverty and disease even before the quake			2
the quake has made the situation far more desperate			0
looting is becoming a big concern for the orphanages as fear and frustration mount and help is slow to arrive , said @entity61 of the @entity18 , a @entity62 - based advocacy group for children in need of families			1
to protect the children , some orphanages are on lock - down , according to volunteers working with the relief agencies			0
" when bringing in supplies to an orphanage , you can only bring in a day or two day 's worth , " said @entity61			1
" if you bring more than that , the locals come in			0
" this week 's raids are included on a growing list of difficulties facing orphanages that is being compiled by the @entity18			2
@entity61 said he expects the challenges of food , medical aid and security to continue affecting the orphanages for weeks			1
for every @entity2 orphan brought to safety in the @entity62 and elsewhere , thousands more are left behind to face the primitive conditions resulting from last week 's earthquake			1
there is no accurate count of how many orphanages have experienced looting and other attacks			2
since the quake , the @entity18 has received dozens of phone calls , text messages and e-mails from orphanages reporting problems ranging from food shortages to security threats			1
the agency is in touch with about 50 orphanages in @entity2 and the reports are updated daily			1
the group is also working with members of @entity109 , the @entity110 and other aid agencies to relay the messages			0
before the quake , @entity2 had 380,000 orphans , according to @entity115			2
it is still too early to determine how many children were orphaned by the quake			0
the people of @entity2 have grown desperate for food , water and assistance since the quake decimated the capital last week , toppling buildings , cutting power , contaminating water supplies and ravaging roads			1
the conditions for children in @entity2 are bleak , aid officials said			1
orphans are sleeping outside or in makeshift tents			0
facilities are running low on food , water and medical supplies			1
some orphanages have already reported deaths			0
@entity140 , an orphanage in the @entity143 section of @entity144 , was looted several times during the first few days after the quake , said volunteer @entity146			1
security was inadequate after 80 percent of the building was damaged , she said			0
the locks were broken and people stole food , clothes and supplies , but the orphanage was able to keep its generator protected , @entity146 said			1
" another aftershock that woke us so roughly on wednesday morning and a wall tumbling down on our heads , children starving , the orphanage being looted as the frustration continues to grow regarding the delay in distributing supplies , children dying from sickness			2
... , " wrote an @entity62 adoption service provider in @entity2 in a blog run by the @entity18			1
reporting crimes to police is nearly impossible for officials at the damaged orphanages			0
many @entity2 police officers were injured or killed in the earthquake			0
help from private security officers also is hindered by unreliable communication and poor transportation			0
security needs to be made a higher priority , said @entity181 , deputy director of @entity183 's @entity182			0
on tuesday , the @entity185 @entity184 approved a proposal to send an additional 2,000 soldiers and 1,500 police officers to @entity2			0
" providing security resources is as equally important as providing all of the other kinds of aid in the country , " @entity181 said			0
" without security , you wo n't be able to effectively distribute to the most needed areas in @entity2			1
" at @entity11 , where looters raided on wednesday night , @entity28 sees both sides of the story			0
" on one hand , the people around the orphanage have been incredibly gracious and mutually supportive since the earthquake , " he said			0
" on the other hand , last night 's attack reminds us that there are a few aggressive people whose growing desperation can drive them to attempt to take others ' food and water by force			1
