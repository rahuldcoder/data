-- death already has a surprisingly vivid presence online			1
social media sites are full of improvised memorials and outpourings of grief for loved ones , along with the unintentional mementos the departed leave behind in comments , photo streams and blog posts			1
now technology is changing death again , with tools that let you get in one last goodbye after your demise , or even more extensive communications from beyond the grave			1
people have long left letters for loved ones ( and the rare nemesis ) with estate lawyers to be delivered after death			1
but a new crop of startups will handle sending prewritten e-mails and posting to @entity30 or @entity31 once a person passes			1
one company is even toying with a service that tweets just like a specific person after they are gone			1
the field got a boost last week when the plot of a @entity41 show " @entity40 " featured similar tools , inspiring an article by @entity44			1
schedule social media posts long into the future " it really allows you to be creative and literally extend the personality you had while alive in death , " said @entity47 , founder of @entity48			1
" it allows you to be able to say those final goodbyes			0
" @entity48 covers all the post-death social media options , scheduling public @entity30 posts , tweets and even @entity59 posts to go out after someone has died			1
the free service will publish the text , video or audio messages directly from that person 's social media accounts , or it can send a series of scheduled messages in the future , say on an anniversary or a loved one 's birthday			1
for now , all @entity48 messages will be public , but the company plans to add support for private missives in the future			0
@entity48 's founders consulted with end of life specialists while developing their service			1
they compare the final result to the physical memory boxes sometimes created by terminally ill parents for their children			0
the boxes are filled with sentimental objects and memorabilia they want to share			0
" it 's not physical , but there are unseen treasures that can be released over time , " @entity47 said of the posthumous digital messages			2
very loosely related : @entity93 and messages from a " dead " girlfriend among the early beta users , @entity47 observed that younger participants were more likely to make jokes around their own deaths , while people who were slightly older created messages more sincere and emotional			1
he 's considered the potential for abuse but thinks the public nature of messages will be a deterrent			2
the site also requires members to pick a trusted executor , and there is a limit of six messages per week			0
" i do n't think that somebody would continually be negative and troll from the afterlife , " @entity47 said optimistically			0
" nobody really wants to be remembered as a horrible person			2
" the @entity41 - based startup will only guarantee messages scheduled for the next 100 years , but in theory you can schedule them for 400 years , should your descendants be able receive @entity30 messages on their @entity125 corneas			2
the company has only tested @entity48 with a group of beta members , but it will finally launch the service for the public at the @entity131 in march			0
fittingly , the event will take place at the @entity134			0
the last , private word for those interested in sending more personal messages -- confessions of love , apologies , " i told you so , " a map to buried treasure -- there 's if i die			2
this company will also post a public @entity30 message when you die ( the message goes up when at least three of your appointed trustees tell the service you 've died ) , but it can also send out private messages to specific people over @entity30 or via e-mail			2
though if i die has attracted a number of terminally ill members , the company 's founders think it could be appeal to a much wider audience			2
" somebody that knows he 's about to die gets time to prepare himself ; the big challenge is when it happens unexpectedly , " said @entity160 , a partner at if i die			2
the @entity165 site launched in 2011 and already has 200,000 users			0
most have opted to leave sentimental goodbyes , and written messages are more common than videos , according the company			0
so far , the service is entirely free , but it plans to launch premium paid options in the future			0
" it 's an era where most of your life and most of your presence is digital , and you want to have some control over it			2
you want to be in charge of how you are perceived afterward , " @entity160 said			0
a tweet - bot to remember you by a more extreme version of this type of control lies at the heart of _ @entity188 , a new project with the catchy tag line " when your heart stops beating , you 'll keep tweeting			2
" still in the early stages , _ @entity188 is a @entity31 tool in development at @entity194 , an advertising agency in the @entity41			1
the agency is partnering with the @entity196 to create @entity31 accounts that post in the voice of a specific person , even after he or she has died			1
when people sign up , the service will monitor their @entity31 habits and patterns to learn what types of content they like and , in the future , possibly even learn to mimic their syntax			1
the tool will collect data and start populating a shadow @entity31 account with a daily tweet that the algorithm determines match the person 's habits and interests			1
they can help train it with feedback and by favoriting tweets			0
" it 's meant to be like a twin , " said @entity222 , a partner at @entity194			2
in the short term , @entity222 and his team said it will serve as a nice content - recommendation engine			0
but eventually , in the more distant future , the goal is to have @entity31 accounts that can carry on tweeting in the style and voice of the original account			1
the people behind the project warn against expecting @entity31 feeds fully powered by artificial intelligence , or worrying about @entity237 , any time soon			1
" people seem to think there 's a button you can press , and we 're going to raise all these people from the dead , " joked @entity222 , who has seen a huge spike in interest in the project over the past week			1
" people have a real faith in what technology can do			2
" @entity251 is still a long way from being able to simulate a specific individual , but recreating the limited slice of personality reflected in a @entity31 feed is an interesting place to start			1
the _ @entity188 service is hoping to roll out to a limited number of test users at the end of march			0
as with the other services , _ @entity188 will require that members choose an executor			0
at this point , it 's as much a thought experiment as an attempt to create a usable tool			1
a little bit of immortality all these companies see the potential for technology to change how people think about death			1
goodbye messages can help people left behind through the grieving process , but composing them can also be comforting to people who are uncomfortable with or afraid of death			1
" we shy away from death			0
it reaches us before we approach it , " @entity48 's @entity47 said			0
" we 're using tech to soften the impact that death has and dehumanize it			0
it allows us to think about death in a more logical way and detach ourselves from it			0
" the prospect of artificial intelligence , even in 140 - character bursts , can also be comforting to people who see it as a way to live on			0
" the afterlife is not a new idea , it 's been around for quite a long time with all the different versions of @entity302 , " @entity194 's @entity296 said			0
" to me this is n't any stranger than any one of those			0
in fact , it might be less strange			0

new tools make it possible to schedule social media posts to go up after death
@entity31 tool could eventually mimic person 's syntax and *tastes* to tweet after death
using these online services can help people think about and plan for death , companies say
