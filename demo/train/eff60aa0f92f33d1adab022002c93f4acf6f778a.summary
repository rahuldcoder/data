@entity0 may be a paradise of @entity5 - rated , @entity4 - starred restaurants , but some of its best food can be found on the streets			1
hundreds of mobile eateries hawking gourmet global cuisine occupy corners across the city , alongside traditional hotdog vendors and halal carts			0
@entity16 halal carts slinging styrofoam plates piled high with falafel , shawarma and rice are ubiquitous in @entity0 , but you 'll recognize " the @entity26 " by the seemingly endless line crowding the sidewalk beside it			2
originally a @entity29 staple , the cart dominated the corner of @entity31 and @entity32 in @entity33 for almost a decade before it won the @entity34 for @entity0 's @entity35 in 2010			1
now , its second cart in @entity38 peddles its famous falafel and shawarma to the masses , in addition to meaty plates like the @entity44 : chicken , kefta and basmati rice topped with chopped onion and doused liberally in tahini and chile sauce			0
@entity26 ; 53rd street and @entity51 ; +1 718 838 8029 @entity52 @entity53 , @entity52 's sunshine - yellow food truck , is a welcome sight for hungry @entity0 during lunch hour			1
every day , the truck 's perpetually cheerful staff hawk classic @entity60 comfort foods like mac and cheese and turkey chili			0
the most popular item by far is the grilled cheese sandwich			0
there are three variations : the classic , the classic with onion and mustard , and a hearty three - cheese version with apple			0
despite not having a regular location -- @entity53 's daily whereabouts must be tracked online -- @entity52 has become a fixture in the @entity0 street food scene thanks to its fiercely loyal following			1
@entity52 ; locations vary ; +1 646 233 3838 @entity80 food truck @entity0 do n't need to go to @entity82 for a good lobster roll			1
thanks to @entity86 , @entity80 's lobster shack on wheels , they only need to walk to the curb			1
rolls come @entity91 - style , served cold with mayo , or @entity93 - style , served warm with butter and lemon , each stuffed with a quarter pound of fresh @entity91 lobster			2
despite a price tag high that 's high for the streets -- $ 16 per roll at the time of writing -- the truck still sells between 300 - 400 rolls every two hours			1
@entity105 ; locations vary ; +1 718 858 7650 @entity107 though @entity107 has recently upgraded to its own brick - and - mortar , its original location at @entity112 's @entity111 street food market still remains			2
lines form before the tiny street stall as early as 11 a.m. each saturday for lumpia , crispy , @entity119 - inspired spring rolls			1
each roll is made using locally sourced ground pork , roasted duck or truffled adobo mushrooms , hand - rolled and then deep - fried			2
unlike regular street food , @entity107 's plating is restaurant quality : the lumpia are arranged artfully on a tray , drizzled with homemade sauce and garnished with pea shoots and pickled vegetables			2
@entity107 ; @entity132 at @entity133 and @entity134 , @entity112 ; +1 917 475 1621 dirty water dogs sometimes it feels like almost every other @entity38 street corner is dressed with the ubiquitous blue and yellow striped @entity139 umbrella , under which you 'll find @entity0 's most iconic street food : the dirty water dog			1
named after the warm , salty water it 's soaked in , the hot frank is served in a soft bun ( which sops up residual water ) and then topped with ketchup , mustard , onions , relish and sauerkraut			0
it 's neither sophisticated nor gourmet , but it 's the quintessential @entity0 food experience			1
various locations @entity156 culinary heavyweights @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 are all said to be fans of @entity162 - winning @entity156 , and it 's no wonder			0
husband and wife owners @entity166 and @entity167 ( " @entity171 " is a portmanteau of their last names ) have been making the stuffed @entity173 corn tortillas in their tiny mobile pupuseria for more than 15 years , selling more than 600 on a regular day			0
the signature platter comes loaded with two pupusas , tangy curtido , pickled jalapenos , tomato sauce and sour cream			0
served on banana leaves with a tangy slaw , the @entity173 tamales are also crowd favorites			0
@entity185 ; @entity186 at @entity187 and @entity188 , @entity112 ; +1 516 965 0214 @entity189 unlike @entity190 , @entity0 is n't renowned for its @entity192 food , but the city has stepped up its game in recent years , thanks in large part to @entity189			1
what started out as a lone taco cart in @entity199 in 2006 -- one of @entity0 's first -- has since grown into a fleet of carts across the city and a handful of brick - and - mortar locations			1
its original @entity199 cart remains its most popular location , still slinging soft corn tacos cradling slow - cooked chipotle pork , hearty bowls of jalapeno cheddar grits and burritos packed with beer - battered fish , beans , rice and @entity216			1
@entity189 ; prince street and @entity218 ; +1 646 590 4172 @entity220 @entity219 traditional @entity220 street food staples can now be enjoyed on the streets of @entity112 thanks to this popular @entity224 stall			2
though saltenas -- crusty , empanada - like pastries filled with meat and vegetables -- are easily its best - selling item , the chola slider is the real star here			0
the modern take on the humble sanduiche de chola comes stuffed with either pork or beef brisket and topped with hibiscus - pickled onions , carrots , kolla cheese and parsley			0
@entity240 ; @entity132 at @entity133 and @entity134 , @entity112 ; +1 347 395 5481 breakfast cart bagels @entity0 boasts many terrific brick - and - mortar bagel shops , but you wo n't get a cheaper or more authentic breakfast than a bagel and coffee from a street cart			1
every morning , locals file out of the subway and make a beeline for the nearest silver breakfast cart , whose narrow shelves are stocked high with bagels and pastries of every kind			0
many pre-prepare their bagels for convenience , but most carts will make your bagel to order			0
coffee , usually deli - quality , is served in small blue - and - white @entity265 cups that have become as characteristic of @entity0 as yellow cabs and dirty water dogs			2

you do n't have to *sit* down to get great food in @entity0
opened in 2006 in @entity199 , a lone taco cart called @entity189 has *expanded* into a *mini-empire*
@entity0 do n't need to go to @entity82 for a good lobster roll , thanks to @entity80
