-- is there any way to ... well ... defend @entity3 ? well , yes			1
when everyone is piling on , it 's time to take a breath and say : we need more facts , less reliance on media reports based on anonymous sources and over-heated pundits who are too ready to rush to judgment			1
as i said on @entity0 's @entity16 show on saturday morning , of course @entity17 made a huge mistake in his decision to give @entity21 running back @entity22 only a two - game suspension after seeing the videotape of @entity22 dragging his then - girlfriend , @entity25 , unconscious , with apparent indifference , out of an @entity28 casino elevator on february 15			1
opinion : why @entity3 must go the public uproar that followed the announcement of @entity22 's suspension took time , too much time , to register with @entity3			1
a month later @entity3 realized he had made a terrible mistake , sending a wrong message that domestic violence by @entity38 players was not all that serious and , thus , putting his own professional reputation and the @entity38 brand at risk			1
but then he turned in the right direction , following the three basic rules of crisis management , whether in business , politics , or life			2
first , he acknowledged that he made a mistake and took personal responsibility			2
he showed that he understood , albeit belatedly , how serious male violence against women is			2
in his august 28 letter to all @entity38 owners , @entity3 wrote : " i did n't get it right			1
simply put , we have to do better			0
" in an accompanying memorandum that would be distributed to all personnel in the @entity38 , he wrote , in bold - faced dark letters , the following : " domestic violence and sexual assault are wrong			1
they are never acceptable and have no place in the @entity38 under any circumstances			1
" voices of domestic violence second , he laid out a detailed forward - looking mandatory education and training program to implement this policy			0
most important , he announced far more severe penalties than before , effective immediately for violations of this bold - faced policy : 1 ) at least six game suspensions for the first violation , with heavier penalties if facts show more serious offenses , such as violence involving a weapon , choking , repeated striking , against a pregnant woman or in the presence of a child ; and 2 ) a second offense will result in " banishment " from the @entity38			2
that 's right , banishment -- with no assumption that a petition for reinstatement will ever be accepted			2
the third rule is to authorize an independent investigation to answer all the questions and verify the facts			2
and that is exactly what happened			0
of course the emphasis is on the word " independent			0
" two owners , @entity100 of the @entity101 and @entity102 of the @entity103 , both of whom are attorneys , appointed former fbi director @entity106 to conduct the investigation of how @entity3 and the @entity38 headquarters handled the @entity22 matter			1
in their public statement , @entity110 and @entity111 asked @entity106 to address specific questions raised in the media , such as " what efforts were made by league staff to obtain the video of what took place inside the elevator and to determine whether , in fact , the video was ever delivered to someone at the league office and if so what happened to the video after it was delivered			0
" @entity110 and @entity111 publicly guaranteed that @entity106 will have full access to all information and all individuals			0
they have committed in advance to make the report public			0
it is safe to assume that anyone who refuses to cooperate with @entity106 will be out			0
i have read about doubts about @entity106 's objectivity because he comes from a large law firm that has ties to the @entity38			1
@entity106 is a former @entity141 attorney , senior @entity143 official , and one of the most respected @entity146 directors in history			0
opinion : @entity150 's power over discipline @entity152 is a tough town			2
i do n't know of a single person in @entity152 who knows @entity106 who does n't regard him as " untouchable " -- a modern - day @entity155 , tough with the highest level of integrity			0
if @entity106 finds that @entity3 lied about not seeing the second videotape or about what he was told by @entity22 on july 16 when they met behind closed doors , @entity3 will no longer be @entity38 commissioner			1
so while commissioner @entity3 made some serious mistakes and dug himself and the @entity38 into a deep hole , he did a pretty good job of crisis management , especially conveying once and for all how seriously the @entity38 views domestic violence			1
now after all the media and pundit frenzy , it is up to all of us to take a breath and wait for mr. @entity106 to complete his work -- and to let proven , verified facts speak louder and more persuasively than innuendo and anonymous sources			0
if only we could do that			0
note : an earlier version of this article incorrectly described @entity22 's football position			1
he is a running back			0
join us on @entity186 / @entity185 .			0

@entity188 : @entity3 *mishandled* the @entity22 case
he says the @entity38 commissioner has followed the right course in responding to crisis
@entity188 : give the investigation time to play out before deciding @entity3 's fate
