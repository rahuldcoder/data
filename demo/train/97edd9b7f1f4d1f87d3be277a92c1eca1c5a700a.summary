the retirement of the pirate leader @entity1 , also known as " @entity2 , " has generated much media coverage , but the real significance of his announcement is the indication it gives of how @entity8 's pirates currently view their business model			1
it appears that hijacking vessels in the @entity12 and the @entity13 is no longer seen as a relatively risk - free affair			0
@entity8 's 3025 - km coastline is the longest in @entity16 , and lies along busy shipping lanes that are crucial for the transport of goods from @entity20 to @entity21 , and of oil from the @entity13			2
it is estimated that between 20 and 30,000 ships pass through this area every year			0
for more than a decade , this environment has provided rich pickings for pirates launching small skiffs from @entity8 's coast , hoping to hold up a ship with its cargo and crew until a ransom is paid by the ship 's owner			2
in 2008 , piracy began to gain international attention as the number of attacks and the amount demanded in ransoms increased dramatically			1
that year was also the one in which @entity2 attained notoriety as the key organizer of a pirate group that conducted two high - profile hijackings			1
men under @entity2 's command captured one of the largest vessels ever hijacked -- the @entity52 , a @entity54 - owned oil tanker the size of an aircraft carrier -- which was carrying 2 million barrels of oil worth $ 100 million , according to some estimates			2
later that year @entity2 's group also hijacked the @entity61 , a @entity63 vessel loaded with weaponry including tanks , anti-aircraft guns and 800 tons of ammunition			0
at the time , it was feared that this cargo could be stolen by the hijackers and sold to criminal organizations or even terrorists but , like the @entity52 , the vessel was eventually released after a ransom of $ 3 million was reportedly paid			0
report : sea piracy drops to lowest level in four years despite these high - profile incidents , there are reports that @entity2 has not been directly involved in piracy since 2009 , and so his retirement will have little effect on the current trajectory of piracy			1
@entity2 's announcement is , however , indicative of a trend that has become increasingly clear over the past year -- that piracy off the coast of @entity8 is no longer as lucrative as it once was			1
there has been growing recognition that piracy does not spontaneously happen at sea , but that it is a phenomenon rooted in the economic and political shortcomings of @entity8			2
in a country where the estimated gdp per capita is only $ 600 ( compared to neighboring @entity99 's $ 1,700 ) , the lack of employment opportunities has meant that the chance of earning up to $ 6,000 from a successful hijack has made piracy a tempting option to many young @entity8 men			2
however , action taken by international governments seeking to protect their trade interests and to maintain security along @entity16 's east coast has led to a decline in successful pirate attacks			1
in 2011 , there were 28 hijackings , 20 % lower than the 2010 figure			0
in the first 11 months of 2012 , @entity8 pirates only managed 13 successful hijackings			0
there has not only been a reduction in successful hijackings , but also in the number of attempts that pirates are making			0
while in 2011 , there were 199 incidents in the high - risk area off @entity8 's coast , by the end of 2012 this figure had dropped by almost two - thirds			1
this reduction in pirates ' success can be attributed to four key factors : the introduction of international naval patrols in the @entity13 and the @entity12 which increasingly collaborate to protect merchant shipping and to apprehend pirates			0
the shipping industry 's implementation of @entity139 , which are guidelines detailing methods of protecting a vessel from attack ( for example , faster travel through the high - risk area , increased vigilance , and ship protection measures such as barbed wire placed around the ship )			1
the presence of armed guards aboard vessels			0
and , perhaps , the example of pirates who have been prosecuted and imprisoned internationally and within @entity8			0
high - ranking @entity8 pirate gets multiple life sentences some may ask what a pirate boss does in his retirement , and @entity2 's public renunciation was clearly meant to garner public interest			1
some lower - level former pirates have begun to offer their services as counter-piracy consultants , or guards aboard fishing boats that operate near @entity8 's coast			1
it would not be unthinkable for @entity2 to position himself as a counter-piracy expert within @entity8			1
@entity8 's former government issued him with a diplomatic passport , reportedly in a bid to dissuade him from carrying out further pirate activity , demonstrating the surprising political connections which he has enjoyed			0
until there is a comprehensive solution to @entity8 's troubles , piracy off the country 's coast will not be ended conclusively -- but it might be contained to a manageable level			2
part of this effort will involve maintaining an international naval presence in the @entity12 and the @entity13 in order to deter those who might still take a chance in attacking a vessel , and to counter wider criminal activity , including people and weapon - smuggling			0
it may seem unfair that a figure like @entity2 appears to have gone unpunished for longstanding criminal activity			0
with more investment of time and money by @entity8 , its neighbors and the wider international community in tracing the financial flows of piracy , identifying and prosecuting those who have financed and benefited hijackings , figureheads such as @entity2 may make the news for their imprisonment , rather than retirement .			1
