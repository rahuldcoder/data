i grew up near the same tree - moss - draped area of @entity3 where @entity5 rep. @entity4 met with followers of @entity7 , the @entity8 leader who in the ' 90s ran for governor and senator in my beloved state			1
all my values were forged in @entity3			2
values like family , faith , community and the desire to help others			2
i understand the so - called conservative values that congressman @entity4 championed , including a deep animosity to taxes			1
still , his decision to seek the support of voters aligned with a white supremacist shows extremely poor judgment			2
he already knew where he was on the political spectrum			2
as @entity30 , a columnist and reporter for the @entity33 ' @entity32 and now for the @entity34 , says , he once told her he was " like @entity7 without the baggage " -- that is , without the @entity38 views			0
@entity4 was 36 at the time of the controversial meeting he is now trying to explain			1
he says he did n't know anything about the group he was speaking to			0
but @entity43 , the man who invited @entity4 to speak , was known to @entity4 as @entity45 's campaign manager			1
@entity43 says he told @entity4 they would n't talk about race or the @entity48			1
that should have been a tip - off			0
@entity43 says he did n't invite @entity4 to address the convention of white supremacists			2
instead , he asked @entity53 to talk to a neighborhood group , the @entity54 , composed mostly of elderly citizens			0
but @entity4 admitted last week that he talked before the @entity56 , which the @entity57 considers a hate group			1
it advocates white supremacy and wants everybody who is n't like its members to leave the country			0
@entity4 said in an interview last week with @entity66 that at that stage of his political career , he spoke before any group who asked him			1
he added he even addressed the @entity71 which " is a pretty liberal group			0
" that 's the group composed of @entity74 and @entity75 who provide identical questions to each candidate and publish their answers without edits so voters can be informed in a nonpartisan manner			2
a number of @entity74 leaders , including @entity85 speaker @entity84 , came to @entity4 's defense			1
@entity84 said @entity4 " made an error in judgment , and he was right to acknowledge it was wrong			2
" there 's a tacit acknowledgment in these defenses that @entity4 knew who he was addressing			1
it seems there 's a concerted effort to make this a non-scandal			0
rep. @entity98 , the lone @entity3 @entity99 , defended @entity4 as " not having a racist bone in his body			1
but it makes @entity4 's appearance much , much worse			1
so many politicians are so eager to push their particular ideology -- or simply score points -- that they do n't consider the larger context			0
was @entity4 's anti-tax message so important that it blinded him to the larger value of dignity and equality ? did @entity4 consider who he was representing ? it 's a delicate line for politicians			1
an appearance is an implicit endorsement of acceptable politics			0
( you do n't have to talk about race or @entity48 )			0
our politicians must be held accountable			0
our universal values , such as " all men are created equal , " should not be violated in the name of seeking votes			2
millions of fallen soldiers who lie in graveyards here and overseas gave their lives defending the principle that every person is individually endowed by @entity136 with human rights , and that it 's the duty of the government to secure these rights			0
is it alright to dismiss an appearance before a hate group as simply an error in judgment ? @entity146 is a former deputy assistant to president @entity147 , and was an adviser to @entity150 's presidential campaign			1
" the party of @entity153 should n't have as its # 3 a keynoter at a white supremacist convention , " he said on @entity151			0
there is a broader issue here than @entity4 and his appearance before a hate group			1
how much better if our politicians took account of themselves first , rather than acting from a perspective of privilege that they can seek votes where they wish without consequences			0
we still have a ways to travel in the 21st century .			0

@entity170 : rep. @entity4 explains meeting with hate group as mistaken political appearance
she says it 's more than that ; it shows pols *willingness* to trade away @entity5 values for votes
