@entity0 -- staff members at eight @entity4 centers manipulated income information given to them by undercover applicants so that the applicants would get benefits they were not qualified for , according to a @entity10 report being released tuesday			1
in response to the report , @entity12 director @entity11 has notified the more than 1,600 operators of @entity4 facilities nationwide of new steps being taken to crack down on fraud			2
the @entity10 report says undercover applicants made 15 visits to 13 centers in six states and the @entity0 to register their fictitious children			1
at eight of those centers , @entity4 employees disregarded " part of the families ' income to register over-income children into under - income slots " or " lied about applicants ' employment status or misrepresented their earnings , " the report says			1
the @entity4 program provides child development services to around 1 million children of low - income families			1
because of its popularity , many @entity4 centers have waiting lists for spots for children			0
the @entity10 report raises concerns that many @entity4 slots are taken up by children of families that are not low income , thereby leaving the targeted low income children on the waiting lists			1
at a @entity57 center , the report says , a @entity4 associate knowingly included the income from only one of the child 's guardians so that the family would qualify for the @entity4			2
and in @entity64 , a @entity4 associate disregarded $ 23,000 in income for a family of three so that they would qualify			0
then , when told that the mother also received some additional cash income from a part time job , the associate replied , " that 's your business , " the report says			0
the @entity10 undercover operation also looked at centers in @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and the @entity0			0
in her letter , sent monday , @entity11 said that the department 's inspector general 's office is following up on the incidents reported by the @entity10 , and that those incidents and any other allegations of fraud could result in criminal prosecutions			0
among other steps the @entity89 will take , she said , are increasing the number of unannounced visits to monitor centers , requiring operators to improve any inadequate controls to prevent errors and other lapses , and developing " new regulations that promote program integrity			0
" " allowing ineligible children to enroll in the program is a blatant violation of @entity4 's rules and it steals opportunity from children who need it most , " @entity11 wrote .			2
