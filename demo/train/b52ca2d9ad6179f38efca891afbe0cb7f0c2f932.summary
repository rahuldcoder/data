-- it was supposed to be a celebration -- sun , fun and relaxation on a tropical island for recent graduates savoring the heady taste of approaching adulthood			0
but instead , the trip to @entity12 by a group of @entity14 , @entity15 , high school seniors ended in tragedy , as one of their members , 18 - year - old @entity19 , never returned home			1
questions surrounding her fate are unanswered five years later			0
now , @entity24 , the youth twice arrested and released in @entity26 's disappearance -- seen by many as a privileged playboy who has displayed no remorse or concern over her whereabouts -- has been named a suspect in the bludgeoning death of a woman in @entity35 , allegations that hint at a chilling pattern			1
@entity24 was arrested thursday in @entity38 following a manhunt			1
" it 's fair to say that he 's a pretty easy guy to point a finger at , a pretty easy guy to say , ' i 'm confident suspecting him , ' " said @entity40 , who represents van der @entity41 in the @entity12 case			1
" and he 's earned some of that and some of it he has n't earned			0
he 's been through the wringer			0
he 's been detained twice in @entity12			2
there 's been absolutely no credible evidence in that case whatsoever ... he was never charged with a crime there			2
" @entity26 was last seen in the early hours of may 30 , 2005 , leaving an @entity59 , @entity12 , nightclub with van der @entity24 and two other men , brothers @entity61 and @entity19			1
she was visiting the island with about 100 classmates to celebrate their graduation from @entity66 in suburban @entity14			0
@entity26 failed to show up for her flight home the following day , and her packed bags were found in her hotel room			2
@entity24 and the @entity70 were arrested and released in 2005 in connection with the case , then arrested a second time in 2007 after @entity12 's then - chief prosecutor @entity74 said he had received new evidence in the case			1
@entity24 , then attending college in the @entity78 , was brought back to @entity12			1
but judges ruled the new evidence -- which included an internet chat the same day @entity26 disappeared with one of the three youths writing that she was dead -- was not enough to keep them in custody			1
in the years since @entity26 vanished , van der @entity24 has consistently denied any involvement in her disappearance , police said			1
" he 's just totally , totally dragged us all through hell , " @entity26 's anguished mother , @entity88 , has said			2
in 2008 , a videotape surfaced on @entity78 television			0
in it , van der @entity24 tells a man he thought was a friend he had sex with @entity26 on the beach after leaving the nightclub , then she " started shaking " and lost consciousness			1
he said he panicked when he could not resuscitate her and called a friend who had a boat			0
the two put @entity26 in the boat , van der @entity24 said , and he went home			1
the friend told him the next day that he had carried the body out and dumped it into the ocean			0
" i do n't lose a minute of sleep over it , " van der @entity24 said			2
he later claimed the account was a lie , saying he told the man what he wanted to hear			0
a court ruled there was not enough evidence to re-arrest him			0
@entity12 chief prosecutor @entity117 said the story was " unbelievable and not true			2
" but it 's been van der @entity41 's cavalier attitude toward the case that has fueled criticism , as well as conflicting statements he 's made			2
he told @entity127 in a 2008 interview he sold @entity26 to human traffickers for $ 10,000 , then in a taped interview denied it			1
at the time his name first surfaced in the @entity26 investigation , suspicion swirled around his parents , particularly his father , an @entity12 lawyer training to be a judge			1
@entity138 was briefly taken into custody in 2005 on suspicion of involvement in the @entity26 case			1
authorities said he told his son that police had no case without a body			2
he was released after three days of questioning			0
@entity26 's parents , however , have said they met with @entity138 and continue to believe he had the answers to questions regarding their daughter			2
" i remember the day i met with @entity138 at the prison , " @entity19 has said			2
" and the thing that stuck out in my mind was i asked him all the questions , why he hid from the news media			0
and the last question that i had was , was he involved , and he said no. he said , ' @entity160 , i can understand your position , but you 've got to understand mine			0
@entity24 's my son and i 'll do everything i can to protect him			0
' and i believe it			0
" @entity24 's mother , @entity166 , has said her son told her he was on the beach with @entity26 but left her there because she wanted to stay			1
she has maintained her son 's innocence			0
however , @entity40 said van der @entity24 's relationship with his family has suffered in recent years			0
" @entity24 in the last several years has gone in a very different direction , has not behaved in a way that is acceptable to anybody , " he said , referring to van der @entity41 's being paid for versions of events in the @entity26 case			1
" it border - lined on pathological , it really did , and quite frankly i think he hurt a lot of people			0
" @entity40 cautioned against jumping to conclusions , saying that many times a new lead was thought to be the key to the @entity26 case but did n't pan out			1
in march , for instance , a @entity187 couple told authorities a picture they took last year while snorkeling off @entity12 showed something that looked like a skeleton			1
authorities called off a dive team 's search after two days , saying they found nothing that resembled the image depicted in the photograph .			0
