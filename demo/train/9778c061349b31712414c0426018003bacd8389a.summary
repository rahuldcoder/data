@entity0 , @entity1 -- at a young age , @entity3 learned not to take things for granted			1
he was 5 years old and visiting a homeless shelter with his mother , who works in various shelters across @entity1			1
he was excited for the opportunity to show off his new light - up sneakers to the rest of the kids			0
but his mom cautioned him against doing so , explaining that these children might not have such luxuries			1
sure enough , when @entity3 met kids at the shelter , he quickly realized that they were living in circumstances that were very different from his own			1
" i saw other kids my age who looked just like me			0
the only difference was , they were wearing old , tattered shoes that were falling apart			2
some did n't have a pair of shoes to call their own , " said @entity3 , now 15			1
" i 've been very fortunate to grow up in a family that is able to provide me with whatever i need			0
a lot of kids here in the @entity34 do n't have the same opportunities			1
" there were 1.6 million homeless children across the @entity34 in 2010 , according to a report from the @entity39 on @entity40 ( @entity41 )			1
with no permanent place to live , many stay on the streets or in shelters , motels , cars and abandoned buildings			0
" homeless children , they should n't have to worry about how they 'll be accepted or how they 'll fit in , " @entity3 said			1
" they should n't have to worry about not being able to play sports or go to school because they do n't have a pair of shoes			2
" that first shelter visit left a strong impression on @entity3 , who started donating all the shoes he 'd outgrown to local shelters			1
but he quickly realized that his donations , while well - intentioned , were n't that helpful			0
" it bothered me that i only had used shoes to give to them instead of new shoes that fit right , " he said			2
" no two people 's feet are identical , and if you are wearing someone else 's worn shoes , your feet are n't going to be very comfortable			2
" so in 2010 , at the age of 12 , @entity3 started a program that donates new shoes to homeless children			1
at first , his efforts were part of a community service project leading up to his bar mitzvah , a @entity77 coming - of - age ceremony			0
but he wanted to ensure that the work would continue after the ceremony			0
" i did n't want to make one donation and stop there , " he said			0
" i wanted it to be something i could do for the rest of my life			0
" with the help of his parents , he then started the @entity88			2
since 2010 , the organization has donated new footwear to more than 10,000 homeless children in 21 states			1
" by giving new footwear to homeless children , i 'm making sure them and their families have at least one less thing to worry about , " @entity3 said			1
" i 'm also allowing parents to save money for an apartment or food for their next meal			0
" two years ago , @entity101 found herself homeless with three young children			1
" it 's been difficult			0
going from shelter to shelter , meeting all these different people			0
my kids did n't have anything that was stable , " said @entity107 , 23			0
keeping up with the demanding needs of her growing children presented additional challenges			2
" i had to decide either to spend money on shoes or medicine and diapers , " @entity107 said			2
" i already felt horrible			0
not being able to provide them shoes made me feel even worse			2
" fortunately , the @entity1 shelter where she was living worked with the got ta have @entity123			0
her children have now received multiple pairs of shoes through the organization			1
" having new shoes makes them feel great , " @entity107 said			2
" i remember when one of my sons got his first pair , he was so excited that he just started kissing the shoes			1
it makes me feel awesome just knowing that they 're happy			0
" since starting this work , @entity3 has heard many emotional stories			1
he remembers one 16 - year - old boy who had fled an abusive living situation with his mother			0
they had to make a quick escape , so the boy put on the first shoes he could get his hands on : a pair of his mother 's old winter boots			2
with no other shoes , the boy had to wear the boots day in and day out			2
not only were they the wrong size , but his classmates made fun of him for wearing women 's shoes			2
the boots became a constant source of embarrassment and discomfort until he received new footwear from @entity3 ' nonprofit			1
" new shoes can make a child feel good about him or herself			2
... they gain confidence ; they 're able to do better in school , " @entity3 said			1
@entity3 also remembers a brother and sister who had to share one pair of sparkly pink sneakers			1
each day , the siblings switched off wearing the sneakers			0
when one went to school , the other had to miss a day			0
the children fell behind in their studies until they each received a new pair of shoes from @entity3 ' group			1
" something that seems so simple , a pair of shoes , made the difference between getting an education or not , " @entity3 said			1
" it 's more than just giving them a new pair of shoes			0
... that 's really what makes it so special for me			0
" the @entity3 family 's garage is full of new shoes that have been donated by footwear companies and stores			1
if they do n't already have the specific size and style that a child has requested , @entity3 uses the group 's monetary donations to buy them			1
the shoes are then shipped to the shelters or , whenever possible , personally delivered by @entity3			1
more than 1,000 volunteers have helped out with the group			0
@entity3 works 15 hours a week on the project -- a time limit imposed by his mother to ensure that he has enough time for schoolwork and other activities			1
@entity3 said he does n't allow his age get in the way of achieving his dreams , and he encourages other young people to do the same			1
" no one is ever too young or old to help others			0
kids do n't always realize that they have the power to make a difference , " he said			0
" i urge other kids to find a passion , create big ideas and act			0
kids can make a huge difference in this world			0
