@entity0 -- facing a bruising midterm election in less than four months , president @entity3 's aides are putting together an aggressive schedule to deploy former president @entity6 at campaign and fundraising events in key states around the country , according to @entity12 officials familiar with the plans			1
" it 's a no - brainer you would use one of the most talented politicians the country has ever had , " said one @entity12 official familiar with the discussions			0
" there are few as good at laying out the contrast with @entity23			1
" there has been speculation @entity6 might not be used that frequently because of lingering frostiness between the two presidents dating to the divisive days of the 2008 campaign			0
but the two camps tried to put any such tension to rest in recent weeks at a quiet @entity33 meeting between @entity6 aide @entity34 and @entity33 political director @entity35 , according to officials familiar with the discussions			0
sources said @entity39 and @entity35 met right after the former president 's surprise decision in late june to buck @entity3 and endorse former @entity43 house speaker @entity42 in a hotly - contested @entity45 primary			1
@entity3 had already endorsed incumbent sen. @entity46 in the @entity12 primary and only learned of @entity6 's move after - the - fact			1
when @entity51 was asked at the time if the @entity33 would like to be notified of such an endorsement earlier in the process , the press secretary responded , " before you guys ? sure			0
" in addition to smoothing things over at the @entity33 meeting , @entity12 officials told @entity1 the @entity6 and @entity3 teams mapped out an ambitious schedule to get @entity6 on the campaign trail as often as possible in between his foreign travels to such hot spots as @entity66			2
" we want whatever we can get from him , " said one of the senior @entity12 officials involved in the conversations			0
@entity12 officials told @entity1 the @entity33 specifically wants to use @entity6 in key swing states where @entity3 is not particularly popular , such as @entity73 and @entity74			1
in his home state of @entity73 , @entity6 already helped @entity12 sen. @entity76 survive an intense primary challenge earlier this year and will now be used to help save the incumbent in an even tougher general election match - up with @entity23 @entity80			1
@entity6 also will be used in @entity74 , where the @entity33 has high hopes of picking up a seat with @entity12 nominee @entity83 facing @entity23 @entity84 , who has been engulfed in a series of controversies			2
" i think he and president @entity3 will be a good one - two punch , " added a second senior @entity12 official			2
the second official noted that @entity3 can not travel to every single congressional district over the next four months , and there are some specific regions where @entity3 would not go over well but @entity6 could play better			1
@entity6 recently campaigned tirelessly in @entity73 , a state that @entity3 lost badly to sen. @entity94 , @entity95 , in 2008 , to help @entity96 survive a runoff			2
in may , the former president also campaigned for @entity99 , the @entity12 candidate in the special election to fill the late @entity12 rep. @entity103 's @entity102 seat			0
@entity6 got a lot of credit among @entity12 after @entity99 defeated @entity23 @entity106 , giving the party a shot in the arm in a difficult year			0
@entity12 officials also say that @entity6 's campaigning could fit well into the narrative that @entity3 has been focusing on in recent days about how he inherited an economic mess from former president @entity113 and now believes the midterm election is a choice between going back to failed policies or moving forward on policies that could help pull the @entity118 out of recession			1
" let 's not forget that @entity6 was the last @entity12 president who had to clean things up after years of @entity23 rule , " said one senior @entity12 official			1
" @entity6 made tough choices that created [ budget ] surpluses			0
he can go out there and say , ' look , i 've lived this			0
' he 's got a lot to offer because it 's like an eyewitness account to what the country will look like if @entity23 get in charge -- the obstruction , the investigations			0

the midterm election is less than four months away
sources say @entity3 's aides will deploy @entity6 in key states
