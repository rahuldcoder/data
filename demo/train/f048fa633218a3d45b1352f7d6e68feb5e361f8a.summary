-- echoes of the 2012 prostitution scandal in @entity3 , @entity4 , lie at the root of the turmoil that has upended the @entity7 , prompting the ouster of its director in the wake of security lapses			1
one link to the @entity14 , involving a former unpaid intern , the son of an @entity17 donor , who was investigated for possible involvement in the scandal , has caused internal complaints about the fairness of the 2012 probe			1
the scandal eventually led to the ouster of eight employees , and discipline against a handful of others at the @entity7			1
however , in the years since , current and former employees , as well as congressional investigators , have complained that @entity14 links to the episode were n't properly investigated , perhaps for political reasons , and that the punishment against @entity7 was too severe			1
how to make a president safe again the internal dissension over @entity3 is one reason why , according to current and former employees , a series of recent security lapses prompted whistleblowers to go to @entity41 to report the @entity7 's incomplete accounting of security lapses that have further embarrassed the agency			1
in the wake of the @entity3 scandal , the @entity14 counsel 's office conducted a probe , interviewing more than a dozen staffers who worked on advance preparation for the presidential trip to @entity4 , according to a person close to the probe			1
it also reviewed a single document purporting to show that a woman had signed her name and a room number on a hotel a piece of paper that appeared to be a sign - in sheet ; the room number corresponded to the volunteer 's room			0
the paper did n't bear a logo , or any indication of being hotel stationery or official business record , according to the person close to the probe			2
@entity73 , an attorney for the former intern , says his client " categorically denies having a prostitute in his room and neither he nor his father contacted anyone at @entity79 or the [ @entity14 ] to seek special treatment - the allegations are false and everyone involved knows they are false			2
" the @entity14 determined that the paper , which did n't include any official logos or stationery marks , could n't be relied on as proof of wrongdoing			0
the @entity14 investigators deemed his denial credible			0
the @entity91 published a story wednesday night alleging that the incident was covered up , and citing complaints from a former investigator with the @entity79 's inspector general who claimed that political interference from the @entity14 prompted changes to be made to the @entity79 inspector general 's report on the @entity3 incident			2
the @entity91 also cited multiple government officials who argue the @entity14 investigation into the volunteer was nowhere near as extensive as the weeks long probe into the @entity7 agents and @entity108 personnel			1
can the @entity7 actually change ? the person close to the internal probe disputed that there was a coverup , citing multiple media accounts of the possible @entity14 link that have been published in the past two years			1
an administration official said the @entity14 's review was thorough and that purported hotel records wrongly implicated at least two people : one , the @entity14 intern , and the other , a @entity7 employee			1
the @entity14 concluded that there was no inappropriate conduct by the intern , the official said			2
" we took this very seriously , " the person close to the probe said			2
" the idea that this [ investigation ] was done flimsily is just not true			0
" complaints that @entity7 employees were treated more harshly than a @entity14 intern overlook one fact , the person close to the probe said			1
the @entity7 agents implicated are armed @entity136 government employees charged with protecting the life of the president and should be held to a higher standard than an unpaid @entity14 volunteer who technically was n't a government employee , the source argued			1
despite the @entity14 denials , inside the @entity7 , the handling of the @entity3 incident has led to dissension			1
some of the @entity7 employees who were implicated were required to sign non-disclosure agreements as part of the disciplinary process , which has further aroused suspicion about the handling of the matter			2
according to current and former employees , low morale among some @entity7 employees is behind some of the recent lapses			2
and it has prompted employees to report their complaints to @entity41 , instead of using internal channels to report problems			0
@entity162 , the agency 's director appointed to help clean up the aftermath of @entity3 , was ousted last week			0
her predecessor , @entity165 , under whose watch @entity3 and other lapses occurred , is now a @entity168 consultant			0
@entity165 was the subject of probes by the @entity172 's public integrity section and the @entity79 inspector general 's special investigations unit			0
they investigated allegations he lied to @entity41 when he testified that the prostitutes involved in the scandal posed no issues for @entity136 intelligence agencies			0
investigators determined that @entity136 intelligence community had information about at least one of the women involved because of possible links to drug cartels , according to people close to the probe			0
the @entity172 and @entity79 inspector general each separately cleared @entity165 of wrongdoing			0
@entity191 , @entity165 's attorney , said " questions that arose concerning mr. @entity165 were looked at and determined to be unfounded			0
" @entity165 recently was appointed to help the government come up with best practices in the aftermath of the @entity197 terrorist attacks			0

the 2012 incident in @entity3 , @entity4 , eventually led to ouster of eight @entity7 employees .
an unpaid @entity14 intern was working as advance staff during the trip .
a person close to the @entity14 investigation says the administration did not try to cover up the link .
