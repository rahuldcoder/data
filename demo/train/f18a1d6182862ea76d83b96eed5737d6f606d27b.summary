-- one of the longest - lasting effects of conflict is one that is all too often hidden away , breaking down social fabric and affecting those it touches for the rest of their lives			0
rape and sexual violence are easy to overlook -- private tragedies with public stigmas			1
according to a new report from @entity17 , children bear the brunt of this unseen crisis , enduring the unthinkable when they are most vulnerable			2
and sexual violence against children is more common than we dare to think			1
more than half of the victims of sexual violence are children , according to our report			1
in places of active or past conflict , from @entity32 to @entity33 to @entity34 , children -- both boys and girls -- have been afflicted by this horrendous crime			2
one study cited in the report shows that in post-conflict @entity32 , a staggering 80 % of victims of sexual violence were children , and the majority of those had been raped			1
the time has come to change those horrific numbers , and we are glad to see that @entity48 leaders have taken a step in the right direction as chair of the @entity48 , the government of the @entity43 is making sexual violence a priority , pledging new funds dedicated to preventing rape in places of conflict , and to make sure that those who survive it are given the care and treatment they need and deserve			1

earlier this week , i spoke to a working group for the @entity75 about the threat of sexual violence facing @entity79 children , who have already been uprooted by a bloody two - year old conflict			1
@entity17 spoke to girls from @entity82 who saw their friends raped and killed by armed men ; children in the @entity86 subjected to vicious sexual attacks in recent fighting around @entity89 ; and mothers in @entity33 whose young children had been raped as the rule of law broke down around them			2
this problem is not isolated , something happening in just one corner of the world , but instead a troubling pattern that we have seen in too many places			2
male victims , often young boys , have been overlooked when it comes to sexual violence , despite evidence that attacks on them , especially in war zones , are significant -- and go unreported			1
we need to face the full scale of sexual violence so that all children , boys or girls , receive that protection and support			1
tackling this problem means shifting attitudes toward sexual violence in war			1
where help is available , it is often geared toward the needs of adults			0
we know in any conflict , children are the most vulnerable , and their needs are unique			2
our report cites the devastation -- physical and psychological -- that sexual violence inflicts on the young			2
with proper support , we can help them heal			0
the problem is not an easy one to tackle , but it must be done			0
funding for protection of children in conflict zones has been difficult to secure			0
it is not as easy to show as items like food and tents , things that donors can see and grasp easily			0
child protection in humanitarian crises is consistently the least funded area of humanitarian response			0
this pledge will help it get the resources a problem of this magnitude deserves			0
it is imperative that we continue to demand that this changes			0
survivors are often too afraid or embarrassed to speak out on what they have been through , sometimes isolated from their communities and lacking confidence those who abused them will face justice			0
we must be vocal in insisting that their needs be met			0
those needs wo n't be met overnight , but on thursday , @entity48 leaders took a bold step to combat this grave violation of children 's rights			1
ensuring proper resources and attention are given this critical issue is the first step in fighting this widespread crime against children			1
