-- reigning @entity2 champion @entity1 has rejected the findings of a positive dope test taken while the cyclist was competing in this year 's race , blaming it on bad meat			1
@entity1 was provisionally suspended from competitive cycling by the sport 's governing body , the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) , on thursday following the results of the test			1
the @entity16 rider , a three - time winner of cycling 's showpiece event , had traces of the banned substance clenbuterol in a test sample he gave on july 21 -- which was a rest day			1
however , in a press conference held in the 27 - year - old 's home town of @entity27 in @entity16 , which @entity0 attended , @entity1 said he was innocent			1
tour of @entity16 runner - up fails doping test " it is a food contamination case of which i am the victim			1
" he added that the test result was due to bad meat he and several other riders had eaten the day before the test			2
" when they confirmed to me what had happened the first thing i did was ask the @entity12 which of my fellow riders had passed the test			2
" they said the only one who passed the control ... was @entity46			0
[ he was the only one of the riders ] who did not eat the meat on that day			0
" he concluded that truth was on his side			0
@entity1 now faces a fight to clear his name after the @entity12 released a statement saying : " the @entity12 confirmed today that @entity16 rider @entity1 returned an adverse analytical finding for clenbuterol			1
" the rider , who had already put an end to his cycling season before the result was known , was nevertheless formally and provisionally suspended as is prescribed by the @entity61			0
" this result was reported by the @entity61 accredited laboratory in @entity63 to @entity12 and @entity61 simultaneously			0
" the @entity12 went on to explain the amounts of the prohibited stimulant found in the sample were low , so a second sample was also tested			2
" in view of this very small concentration and in consultation with @entity61 ( @entity61 ) , the @entity12 immediately had the proper results management proceedings conducted including the analysis of b sample that confirmed the first result			0
" further analysis of the results will now be carried out by @entity12 and @entity61 , with no further comment being made until it has been concluded			0
" the @entity12 continues working with the scientific support of @entity61 to analyze all the elements that are relevant to the case			2
" in order to protect the integrity of the proceedings and in accordance with the @entity61 , the @entity12 will refrain from making any further comments until the management of this adverse analytical finding has been completed			0
" @entity88 , who finished runner - up to @entity1 in this year 's @entity2 , said he hoped the @entity90 would prove his innocence			1
" i hope he is innocent and i think he deserves the right to defend himself now , " @entity88 wrote on the micro-blogging site @entity93			1
" what a crazy day in cycling with the news about @entity1			1
i only heard about it in the press			0
" @entity99 , who finished second to @entity1 in the 2007 edition , said he wanted to find out the facts of the case before passing judgment			1
'' i just read some little things in the paper , i do n't really know what the situation is			0
[ but ] if people are cheating and getting caught , that 's a good thing			0
if people want to exaggerate the stories and ... claim cycling is a filthy sport , that 's not such a good thing			0
" i do n't know exactly what the situation is , they 're still waiting on further analysis			0
i 'd like to see what facts come about @entity1 before i make an opinion			1
'' @entity123 , features editor of @entity126 magazine , believes it is possible the @entity90 could have received the substance in food , and this case is not comparable to other doping scandals in cycling			1
@entity123 told @entity0 : " this really does sound like a legitimate excuse			1
" it 's well known that clenbuterol is used on cattle			0
this is an alibi that 's been used before and it 's been verified before			0
it does n't sound impossible to me			0
" he said that people familiar with other incidents of doping in the sport will recognize that @entity1 has been unlucky			2
" most people who are au fait with how doping within cycling works will be fairly sure that this is quite different to other cases , " he said			0
@entity123 also explained how taking clenbuterol would not make sense for @entity1 and it could possibly have a negative effect on his performance			1
" he is well known for his climbing ability			0
this substance is a steroid , which will boost muscle mass and make him heavier			2
it 's not really the kind of substance you would expect a rider like him to take			2
" @entity1 , who has just signed a contract with the @entity169 team , successfully defended his @entity170 while riding for the @entity173 - based @entity172 team			1
the @entity90 won his first tour in 2007 and joined @entity172 in 2008 -- although he was prevented from defending his title that year as the team had been banned by race organizers for previous doping violations			2
in 2006 , @entity1 was linked to a @entity16 - based blood - doping ring known as " @entity180 " but was cleared of any wrongdoing			1
the only previous winner of the @entity2 to be stripped of his title after being found guilty of using a banned substance was @entity184			1
the @entity185 was found to have taken testosterone while winning the 2006 race .			2

@entity1 rejects claims he took a banned substance
@entity123 , features editor of @entity126 , says the case is not like other scandals
