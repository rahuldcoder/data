@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was 11 march 2011 , and i remember standing in the newsroom that friday afternoon glued to the television watching the horrific images coming out of @entity1			1
the aerial pictures of the tsunami as it engulfed the coastline swallowing up everything in its path filled me with dread			0
that image will be etched in my memory forever			0
little did i know that 24 hours later i would be on the ground in @entity1 covering the nation 's biggest disaster			2
while we were focused on the mass devastation and the countless victims from the earthquake and tsunami , there was another catastrophe unfolding -- a nuclear crisis			2
the disaster had caused meltdowns at the @entity30 and it was threatening @entity31			2
no reporter was allowed anywhere near @entity0 -- it was too unsafe			1
it would be more than two and a half years before i 'd finally set foot in @entity0			1
we 've been invited by the plant operator @entity37 to inspect the progress being made -- it 's the first time any media crew has been allowed that close to the decommissioning work underway inside @entity0			1
as we drive towards the plant i notice empty houses , overgrown gardens and fields and realize these homes have n't been touched since their residents evacuated during the crisis in 2011			2
this once bustling community of 60,000 people is now a ghost town ; the only sign of life , a checkpoint in the @entity55			1
hazardous fuel removal process begins at @entity0 we 've entered the " exclusion zone			1
" the only people passing through are the 3,500 workers who travel each day to @entity0 to undertake dangerous clean - up work , exposing themselves to high levels of radiation			1
we arrive at the plant under a @entity37 escort and are taken to a building to measure our radiation levels			2
we 'll do this again at the end of the tour to see how much radiation we 've each absorbed			0
then it 's time get kitted up in protective clothing			2
the ensemble includes a @entity75 suit , two pairs of socks , rubber boots , three pairs of gloves , a hat and mask -- no skin is left exposed			0
we also carry a dosimeter to measure the external radiation levels			0
with the appropriate attire and equipment , we are taken on a tour of the plant situated at the base of mountains , right on the coast			2
as we look out at the calm sea , it 's hard to imagine how the ocean could have been so deadly and destructive that day back in 2011			0
the single success story for @entity37 is @entity97 -- it suffered a hydrogen explosion during the crisis , but received the least amount of damage of all four reactors			1
the reason ? it was under maintenance and was n't operational the day the earthquake and tsunami hit			0
inside the giant building that has been rebuilt is a large cooling pool			0
above the pool is an enormous crane that has begun to successfully move the 1500 fuel rods covered in the deep green water			1
@entity37 has described this as " a milestone			0
" they 're being transported to a storage pool next door where they will stay for the next 20 years			0
it 's a delicate and slow process that 's expected to be completed by the end of 2014 -- decommissioning reactor 4			0
but these milestones are few and far between			0
@entity37 's main challenge is working out how to shut down reactors 1 , 2 and 3 that all suffered meltdowns and remain dangerously radioactive			1
the other big problem is contaminated water			1
@entity37 is collecting 400 tonnes of it each day , storing it in newly built tanks on the site			0
there is a real fear this radioactive water is seeping into the ground and into the sea			0
as i look around the plant from a high vantage point on top of one of the buildings i see a broken @entity0 desperately trying to heal itself and a country that came so close to a nuclear catastrophe			1
@entity1 is indebted to the thousands of workers , who risk their life each day , continuing their mission to finish the job and close this painful and frightening chapter in @entity1 's history .			1

@entity2 was granted exclusive *access* to the heart of @entity0 's nuclear plant
workers are using a crane to remove 1500 fuel rods *submerged* in water in @entity97
three other reactors that suffered meltdowns pose an even bigger problem
the area around the plant , once a bustling community , is now a ghost town
