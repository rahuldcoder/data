-- in a stunning reversal of fortunes , @entity2 's president @entity1 was deposed by a military coup just one year after being sworn in as president			1
the @entity2 protesters who took to the streets by the millions over the past several days to demand @entity1 's resignation were jubilant as news spread wednesday that their goal had been met : @entity1 's @entity13 - backed government was gone , along with its creeping authoritarianism and mismanagement			1
the leaders of the protest movement are insisting that what happened was not a military coup , but rather a remarkably peaceful demonstration of the will of the people to achieve the original goals of the revolution : bread , freedom , social justice and human dignity			2
@entity1 's embittered supporters see it quite differently : even as their democratically elected leader was talking compromise with an opposition that would have none of it , he was pushed out of office by a military that positioned its tanks in strategic locations throughout the capital , took control of state media , and has placed @entity1 and key advisers under house arrest			1
the @entity13 website on thursday warned of a " new era of repression and tyranny			0
" they know of what they speak : there is a long , dark history of @entity2 's military rulers brutalizing @entity13 leaders			1
within 20 years of its founding in 1928 by @entity57 , a charismatic schoolteacher and preacher , the @entity13 was disbanded by the @entity2 government , which felt threatened by its rapid spread			1
@entity61 , a popular grass - roots political , social and religious movement , had attracted a huge following with its simple slogan , " @entity68 is the solution , " and its provision of social services			0
by the time it was banned in 1948 , it had nearly 2 million members			0
several violent decades followed as increasingly radical @entity13 members took up arms in an attempt to realize their goal of creating an @entity68 state			0
but by the 1970s , the organization renounced violence and vowed to participate in the political process			0
still , the government barely tolerated the @entity13 ; under longtime president @entity82 , @entity13 leaders were regularly arrested in crackdowns			2
although the @entity13 did not lead the events of january 2011 that toppled the @entity82 regime , it quickly capitalized on them to become the political front - runner in post-revolutionary @entity2			2
aware that it was held in deep suspicion by many at home and abroad , the @entity13 at first vowed not to dominate the country 's new politics			2
" we will not have a presidential candidate , " promised @entity1			0
" we want to participate and help			0
we are not seeking power			0
" but that promise quickly faded as the @entity13 's @entity97 , buoyed by its superior organizational structure and credentials as a stalwart opposition , took the largest number of seats in the new parliament ( 43.4 % ) and then won the presidency			2
the @entity13 's secular opponents became increasingly uncomfortable that they were watching a slow - motion takeover of the country by an organization that at heart remained secretive , autocratic and theocratic			1
from the start , @entity2 's political stage was set for an impasse between secularists and supporters of the @entity13 , who believed they had won a mandate to govern the country and shape @entity2 's future in their @entity120 vision			1
the @entity120 never seemed to acknowledge that @entity1 had won the presidency in a runoff with barely a majority of votes ( 51.7 % ) , and that in the first round of voting , his secular opponents combined had more than 55 % of the vote			1
@entity1 behaved arrogantly , pushing through a controversial constitution with little consensus , passing a highly divisive edict putting the president 's actions above judicial review , and in his most recent politically tone - deaf move , appointing 17 provincial governors last week , all affiliated or allied with the @entity13 -- including an astonishingly divisive member of @entity139 , the organization responsible for the devastating 1997 massacre of 58 tourists in @entity142			1
for their part , secularists never accepted the legitimacy of the @entity1 government and vowed to prevent political @entity68 from taking hold			2
the judiciary , filled with holdovers from the @entity82 regime , tried to use the courts to undermine the @entity152 government			0
leaders of the opposition deemed any @entity156 effort to compromise as half - hearted and refused to test the political process			0
against this background of political polarization , the country staggers under a teetering economy			0
the millions of @entity2 who filled the streets in recent days demanding @entity1 's resignation were protesting not only his authoritarian tendencies , but also his economic mismanagement			1
@entity2 's fate now hangs on whether @entity2 's secularists and @entity120 can be reconciled			1
thursday 's statement by the @entity171 , the alliance of opposition parties -- stressing that no parties , " particularly political @entity68 groups " should be excluded from ongoing reconciliation talks -- is a positive one			0
so too are @entity1 's calls for his supporters to pursue only peaceful protests			1
but the crux of the matter is that the process of writing a new constitution , which the military has promised to oversee , is unlikely to give @entity68 as preferred a position as the one that @entity1 pushed through			2
will extremist islamists conclude that violence is the only way they can achieve their goal of an @entity68 state ? the specter of @entity193 's civil war hangs heavily over the situation : in 1991 , the @entity193 military took control of the government after @entity120 looked poised to come to power through elections			1
the ensuing decade of conflict left as many as 100,000 dead			0
ultimately , the role of @entity68 in the state must be settled by the people themselves			0
if @entity2 approve , through a fair and open referendum , a new constitution that reduces @entity68 's role , it will take the wind out of the sails not only of the @entity13 , but of political islam across the region			1
but if @entity2 returns to a cycle of repression and violence , it will only serve to revitalize a radical movement			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			0

@entity13 *decries* coup , recalls history of military rulers brutalizing its leaders
after @entity1 's win , secularists *feared* a takeover by theocratic @entity13
but @entity13 believed it had won a mandate to govern , @entity220 says
@entity233 : @entity2 must choose secular or @entity120 rule , hope islamists do *n't* turn to violence
