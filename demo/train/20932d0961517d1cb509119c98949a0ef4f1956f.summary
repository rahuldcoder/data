on wednesday , the @entity0 kicks off the confirmation hearing for @entity3 , president @entity4 's nominee to replace @entity5 as attorney general			1
the attorney general -- our nation 's chief federal law enforcement officer -- plays a vital role ensuring laws and regulations are faithfully executed , while respecting and defending the rights of @entity15 citizens as well as the duties of each independent branch of government			1
unfortunately , for the past several years , leadership at the department has often lost sight of this mission			0
instead , it has engaged in a sort of constitutional gymnastics , contorting the intent of the enumerated powers to provide the president practically carte blanche authority for some of his more extraordinary executive actions			0
the @entity33 's lack of responsiveness to congressional inquiries on anything from " @entity37 " to the president 's executive action on immigration has been a constitutional slap in the face to the @entity15 people			1
the @entity33 , like any other federal agency , must be accountable to the people			1
this requires transparency and cooperation with @entity48			0
a renewed commitment to transparency and accountability at the @entity33 will depend largely on the actions of its next leader			2
the tone set by a new attorney general could be a turning point in the relationship between the department and @entity48			1
as chairman , i intend to hold a fair and thorough hearing to carefully evaluate @entity3 's qualifications and perspectives			2
while she has been confirmed twice as a @entity15 attorney , she 's never had a nomination hearing before the committee			1
leading the @entity33 is a whole different ballgame , one with serious implications for a number of important national policy areas going forward			2
she 'll be asked tough questions from all members of the committee , and her responses will provide valuable insight into what sort of attorney general she may be			1
this is @entity3 's opportunity to make her case			2
the hearing is scheduled to last at least two days			0
on wednesday , senators will be able to ask @entity3 about her experience and her views of how the @entity33 should operate			1
the second day will be dedicated to testimony from witnesses selected by senators on both sides of the aisle			0
my philosophy as chairman is to provide members of the committee as much time as they need to question the nominee adequately , in a live setting			0
@entity98 began weeks ago , shortly after her nomination			0
my office has been working to collect the necessary materials needed for a comprehensive review of @entity3 's background			2
i appreciate that the @entity33 has been largely accommodating in the committee 's requests for documents throughout this process			0
this week , as the @entity0 fulfills its constitutional duty to provide advice and consent , the @entity15 people will have the opportunity to learn how @entity3 intends to lead the department , if she is confirmed			1
the country faces difficult challenges that the attorney general must meet head - on			1
it will take someone who has the right qualifications and experience to fill the job			0
i look forward to hearing @entity3 's responses to our questions and evaluating her credentials for this important post .			0
