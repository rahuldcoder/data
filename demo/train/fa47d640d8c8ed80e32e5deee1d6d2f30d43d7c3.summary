-- the 34 - year - old dental hygienist from @entity2 , @entity3 , had just rammed her black luxury car through barricades and into police cruisers near the @entity7 , one of @entity10 's securest areas			1
in the car with @entity12 was her 1 - year - old daughter			1
police say @entity12 then sped down @entity15 before crashing			2
two law enforcement officers were injured during the incident , and officers fatally shot her			1
but was the shooting of the unarmed woman justified ? had @entity12 been shot a few moments earlier , such as when police had surrounded her car and she drove into them or as she sped off , it would have been justified because she had used her car as a deadly weapon , pointing it at the officers , said @entity29 , a @entity0 legal analyst			1
but if the shooting occurred after the car stopped and if @entity12 had gotten out , as some accounts unconfirmed by @entity0 have suggested , that changes things , he said			1
" if she did not turn on them like she was going for a gun , something to at that point say the threat is ongoing and immediate and imminent , then maybe the police should have taken a breath , waited , " @entity29 said			1
opinion : did @entity10 cops have to shoot to kill ? they would have quickly determined that she posed no threat , he said			0
what if police fear a terrorist bomber ? but @entity49 , chairwoman of the @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 at @entity53 in @entity54 , said police would have had no way of knowing whether @entity12 posed a threat as she got out of the car , and therefore the shooting was justified			1
" we live in times of heightened alert as far as terrorist activities are concerned , " she said			0
" the fact that she was not displaying a gun does n't mean anything , because bombers do n't necessarily display anything			0
they have the explosives around their waist , usually			0
" it 's a matter of a split - second decision that the police officer needs to take before someone explodes himself			2
it 's all about the larger context			0
they just push the button , or it could be activated from a remote location			0
" @entity0 law enforcement analyst @entity79 said the police had no choice but to shoot			1
" you do n't know if she has a bomb , " he said			0
" you do n't know if it 's a terrorist attack			0
the officers just do n't know			0
" @entity79 dismissed suggestions that police could have defused the situation simply by shooting out the car 's tires			2
" if you are using deadly force , you are there to try to incapacitate the driver of that car -- of that weapon , " he said			2
" if they did shoot the tires out , the car can keep moving			2
" and the handguns used by @entity102 might not have done the job , according to @entity0 law enforcement analyst @entity104			1
" these tires are synthetically wrapped , like @entity105 , like a bulletproof vest , " he said			0
he noted that law enforcement officers were acutely aware that the incident was occurring near some of the nation 's most sensitive sites			1
" we 're not talking about some cornfield in @entity114 , " he said			0
" we 're talking about downtown @entity10 " @entity104 said officers had to consider whether the woman had explosives in her car : " is she just looking for a large gathering of people that she can drive up close to them and explode a bomb ? " @entity12 's family is questioning whether shooting @entity12 was the only way to end the chase			1
" we want to know if protocols were followed , " family attorney @entity128 said on @entity0 's @entity129			2
" ... we are going to conduct our investigation , and we are not going to go with just what the government said			0
" rules have changed since 9/11 after the september 11 attacks , police chiefs reconsidered whether the usual rules of using lethal force were sufficient to deal with people who might detonate a bomb when confronted by police			1
the @entity142 adopted a suicide bomber policy in 2004			1
then - chief @entity144 told the @entity145 in 2005 that @entity7 officers were trained to shoot a suspected bomber who refused to stop and be searched			1
the @entity102 public affairs office could not be reached friday night to confirm whether that policy remains in place			0
the @entity151 issued guidelines for coping with suicide bombers in 2005 , including a recommendation that officers need not wait until the threat is imminent before using deadly force			2
within weeks of that report , @entity158 police officers using a similar policy shot and killed a man they had wrestled to the floor of a train because they incorrectly suspected he had a bomb			1
anti-terrorism policies often allow officers to fire without warning a suspect to surrender because a warning might simply alert the bomber to detonate			0
@entity169 , an assistant @entity7 attorney , wrote in the magazine of the international police chiefs group in 2007 that @entity172 are accustomed to debates about whether a suspect made an overt threat to harm someone			1
" in the context of suicide bombers , however , this debate is irrelevant			0
suicide bombers always pose an imminent threat of death and serious injury , whether they are moving toward or fleeing from their target , for at any time they may detonate , " @entity169 wrote			0
@entity0 's @entity185 and @entity186 contributed to this report .			2
