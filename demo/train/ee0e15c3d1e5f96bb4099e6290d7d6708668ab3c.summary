but as countless vessels pass through the bustling shipping hub each day , the environmental toll is far from light			0
in fact , @entity1 emits a whopping 29.8 tonnes of carbon per capita , one of the highest in the world			1
in comparison , the @entity14 city beats @entity17 's carbon emissions at 9.6 tonnes per capita and @entity18 at 11.7 tonnes per capita			2
to put that into perspective , the global average is about 4.6 tonnes per capita			0
now mayor @entity22 has plans to make @entity1 the most sustainable port city in the world by cutting its carbon footprint by 50 percent			1
with a greener future ahead , @entity0 takes a look at five sustainable initiatives planned for the @entity14 port city			1
floating homes to cope with rising sea levels , @entity1 plans to build floating urban districts calling for 13,000 climate - proof floating homes in by 2040 -- of which around 1,200 would be built on top of the water			1
to showcase how this might work , the @entity38 commissioned the " @entity40 "			0
constructed by @entity42 , the three transparent interconnected domes are perfectly positioned in the @entity43 , @entity44			0
not only is the structure almost entirely self sufficient due to the solar powered heating and air conditioning , it 's also built with a special plastic material , which is 100 times lighter than glass			2
water plazas @entity1 's waterways may be responsible for a bulk of the city 's prosperity -- but that 's not to say that the day to day living below sea level is easy for its residents			1
to combat the heavy rainfall , urban design and planning company @entity61 came up with the concept of constructing water plazas that serve as the perfect solution to holding excess water and take the pressure off the sewerage system			0

@entity83 rooftop revolution nothing paints a more sustainable urban picture than green rooftops			0

to spur the green rooftop movement , @entity1 kicked off a scheme to help residents fund the installments			2
not only do green patches provide a buffer to help absorb excess rainwater , but they also clear the atmosphere and slow down roof erosion , according to @entity38			0
so far , you can find the greenery on top of a slew of the city 's buildings including the @entity106 , the @entity107 , the head office of @entity109 , the @entity110 , the @entity111 and the museum @entity112			2
sustainable port @entity1 's @entity114 says it wants to become the most sustainable port city in the world by 2015 and it has also committed to cutting its carbon emissions by half of 1990s levels by 2025			1
one way it hopes to reach this goal is by allocating 80 hectars of land around the port to biobased companies			0
while @entity1 has more than 45 chemical companies , five oil refineries and several power plants , the port also houses 10 production companies that use renewable energy as their raw material			1
@entity14 scientists have also examined how to better capture and store co2 emissions by developing a new ship coating that will lower algae growth			0
another proposition in the works is to examine the usage of new collapsible containers that could save space and in turn cut trips			0

public transport for nature a sustainable city is one that looks after not only its human population , but also its wildlife , plants and insects			1

@entity1 's public transportation could be transformed into green corridors that could bring butterflies , dragonflies , crickets and grasshoppers into the city center			1
if implemented , bus stops and metro stations could provide shelter for the people and foraging for the birds and insects .			0

@entity1 's population totals *615,000*
