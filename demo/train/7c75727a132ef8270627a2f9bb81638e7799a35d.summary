-- in recent weeks , a series of @entity0 articles have appeared purporting to get to the bottom of male infidelity			1
" men more likely to cheat on @entity15 , " one headline informs us ; yet in the body of the article we are told that the opposite is true as well : " a man who makes significantly more money than his girlfriend or wife is also more likely to cheat			1
" it 's a bit bewildering , keeping track of all the things that could cause a man to be unfaithful			2
earn too much and he might cheat , but earn too little and he might cheat then , too			2
association is not the same as causality , but news outlets have latched on to this anyway as the reason actress @entity25 was betrayed ; high - and - low - earning ladies everywhere had better beware			1
this article and others like it that surface in the media every so often amount to something of a cottage industry in the justification of male infidelity			2
scratch the surface of any of them and you get a phenomenon of male entitlement that is oddly abetted by some women			0
for example , if you thought that the man himself had anything to do with it , former " sugarbabe " and mistress @entity44 explains otherwise in an article that ran a few weeks ago : " men are hardwired to betray women on the long - term			1
" in this view , man is but a victim of faulty " wiring " -- although the wires evidently worked well enough to fund her " sugarbabe " business			0
but the real eye - opener was psychologist @entity58 's @entity0 essay , " monogamy unnatural for our sexy species			1
" before reading this , i had n't realized that i could have a " central , respected role " as part of a " harem of women " and that marriage was all a ruse to make the " human female [ into ] just another possession for men to accumulate and defend , along with his house , slaves and asses			2
" i have already notified my husband that i am onto him , and that he may no longer defend nor accumulate me for " pair bonding			0
" curiously , accumulating large numbers of other women poses no problem , according to @entity58			0
for on account of " women 's pendulous breasts " -- and the vast evolutionary forces that have produced them -- he suggests it 's " utterly natural " for men to cheat , or to exhibit " nonpossessive , gregarious sexuality			1
" we are , he points out , " the most sexual species on earth			0
" at first i was confused about why this sexuality can only be expressed via multiple partners , but then i got to the part about the " @entity96 [ who ] famously enjoy frequent group sex that leaves everyone relaxed and conflict - free			2
" and who , really , can argue with that ? all i ask , as a woman , is for consistency			0
when we turn to the bonobos to be our guides , let 's not be quite so selective about the take - home message			1
let us try to examine every species more thoroughly			0
for example : true , women have " pendulous breasts , " but hey , men have pendulous ears , and what could those possibly be for ? any serious evolutionary scholar can plainly see that the human male is designed to be listening to women at all times			1
that 's why their ears are larger			2
@entity58 claims that , since the male organ is " the longest [ and ] thickest , " we can not deny the evidence that " prehistoric promiscuity " is part of our primate inheritance			2
yet this fascinating investigation is cut short			0
if we continue traveling further upwards , we discover that a man 's arms are also generally longer and thicker than a woman 's			0
from a strictly scientific standpoint , here we see a strong indication that a man is evolutionarily adapted to give out more back rubs than he gets			0
sure , today an individual man can refuse a request for a massage , but when the next wave of natural selection works its magic , he may find that his massage - phobic genes are out of the running			1
once at the @entity146 , my family witnessed a male orangutan picking nits off his baby 's hair , while the female lolled about peacefully , grooming herself under a tree			0
can there be any clearer precedent , from an evolutionary perspective , for men to scrape the dinner plates while women get manicures ? another time on @entity160 , i saw a female gorilla munching on stinging nettles , even though they seemed to bother her			1
it was a humbling , yet powerful directive for me to go shopping even though i could n't really afford a new outfit			0
ladies , if you ca n't beat ' em , join ' em. it is time to stop arguing with evolutionary theorists when they use bonobo behavior to justify their own low standards			1
why should men have a monopoly on the totally arbitrary selection of chimp behavior that renders their own predilections normative under the guise of scientific observation ? i am picking up my pad of paper , i am ready to take notes and i am headed for the zoo			0
do the gorillas speak to you , too ? if they do n't , simply write to let me know what behavior of yours you 'd like to rationalize , and i am confident that working together as a scientific team , we can find a gorilla somewhere out there doing that very thing with a vengeance			0
let 's face it -- the new " science " of infidelity is just not very scientific			1
it certainly provides a convenient " out " to deny personal responsibility , but anyone who buys this " science " is missing out on the best parts of being human : the freedom that comes from self - control and the intimacy that can only come with commitment			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			1

@entity213 says recent articles spin evolutionary theories to justify infidelity
one says men more likely to cheat on *breadwinner* wives , but also on low - earning wives
another claims men " hardwired " to cheat , she says ; a third says infidelity natural , as with apes
@entity213 : infidelity " science " a convenient excuse ; men 's better selves have self - control
