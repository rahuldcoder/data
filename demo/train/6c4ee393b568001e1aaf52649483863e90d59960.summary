-- the situation in @entity2 would break the heart of anyone who has one			1
that is why progressives desperately want peace in @entity2 , an end to the chemical weapons attacks and aid for the millions of refugees			1
additionally , most of us support president @entity15 and want him to have a successful presidency			1
but we must be consistent			0
we have a worldview that requires the right thing to be done -- in the right way			0
that is why those of us who opposed president @entity23 's war in @entity24 have no choice but to oppose @entity15 's proposed attack on the @entity2 regime			1
there are three reasons , at least			0
in 2003 , we condemned @entity23 and secretary of state @entity30 for relying on dodgy evidence of weapons of mass destruction while making the case for war before the @entity36			1
but at least @entity23 took his case to the @entity36			1
@entity15 has not formally presented any evidence to the @entity36 -- at all			1
we attacked @entity23 for conjuring up his own , personal " coalition of the willing " to launch a war			1
@entity23 's alliance was cobbled together largely out of a bunch of countries that many people in the @entity45 had never heard of -- some of which were sending only a handful of troops			1
and yet @entity15 has virtually no coalition at all			1
even the @entity51 wo n't strike with us on this one			2
so @entity15 would be attacking with a smaller coalition than @entity23 had			1
we condemned @entity23 's team because , even though our forces won the war , @entity23 had no plan to win the peace			1
unfortunately , @entity15 seems to have no plan to win the war -- or the peace			1
he is just proposing " limited , proportional strikes " -- without explaining what happens next after @entity2 inevitably strikes back somehow			1
it is hard to get into a " limited , proportional " fistfight			0
there is no way to keep this war limited			2
the region is a powder keg with @entity70 's @entity69 and @entity71 poised to retaliate for any strike against their ally @entity73			2
@entity73 could drag @entity75 into the conflict if he struck that nation			0
furthermore , the @entity73 regime has had weeks to fortify or hide prime targets , including his chemical weapons from attack by air			2
all of these may well mean , that despite secretary of state @entity86 's protestations , we may have to engage in a land war and put " boots on the grounds " to achieve our military objectives			2
mission creep and chaos are normal parts of war			0
instead of jumping feet first into a war , we need to get creative			0
two options short of war leap to mind			0
disrupt and deter without violence			0
cyberwarfare has proven extremely effective containing @entity71 and disrupting its nuclear program through the @entity103 virus @entity45 intelligence agencies developed			0
a similar cyber campaign aimed at disabling the communications and weapons delivery systems of the @entity73 regime could " degrade " @entity73 's ability to attack innocent civilians just the same			0
@entity15 has slowly built up a coalition of the reluctant			1
from @entity117 to @entity118 , our allies are strongly opposed to @entity73 's acts but hesitate to endorse , let alone join , a @entity45 military coalition to hit the @entity2 leader			1
we all want an end to the civil war			2
let 's engage @entity125 , @entity71 and the @entity126 and renew efforts for a conference to end the conflict			0
if the backers of the rebels and @entity73 's regime are shamed into a summit , the civil war may find a peaceful resolution			0
it may not work , but it 's worth a try			0
the ongoing situation in @entity2 is a tragedy			2
the suspected use of chemical weapons against innocent civilians by the @entity73 regime is despicable and deserves our condemnation			0
but military strikes by the @entity45 under these conditions wo n't make the situation better -- and could potentially make it much worse			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity153 .			2

@entity153 : yes , we want peace in @entity2 and an end to chemical attacks
but he says supporting a military strike on @entity2 would be to *repeat* *mistakes* from @entity163
@entity153 : @entity23 took his case to the @entity36 ; @entity15 has not presented evidence there
he says @entity23 had *broader* coalition , no plan to win peace ; @entity15 has no plan for war
