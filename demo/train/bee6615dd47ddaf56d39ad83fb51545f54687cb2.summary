partisan hyperbole has ratcheted up as the @entity2 administration grapples with thousands of young undocumented immigrants surging the @entity6 - @entity5 border and facing angry protesters on the way to overcrowded detention centers			1
@entity10 blame president @entity2 for exacerbating the problem			1
they say the policy of temporarily deferring deportations of children sent a signal to thousands of kids fleeing poverty and violence in @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 that they could stay in @entity6			1
immigrant children tread treacherous political landscape and even one @entity24 , rep. @entity25 , whose @entity27 district borders where immigrant children cross the @entity28 , feels @entity2 has been " one step behind			1
" @entity2 and many democrats say @entity31 @entity10 are to blame for rejecting @entity33 - passed immigration reform last year without coming up with their own plan			1
and in the latest development on monday , the @entity31 said most children involved probably wo n't be allowed to stay in the country			1
beyond the bickering , both sides have valid points , immigration policy and law experts say			0
here 's a reality check			0
why is this happening ? unaccompanied minors have been trekking to the @entity6 in steadily increasing numbers since 2012 , according to the nonpartisan @entity47			0
over roughly the past year or so , however , both the numbers and home countries shifted dramatically			0
where previously @entity5 children made up the bulk of them , a surge more recently from @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 has been seen			1
" in reality , there is no single cause			0
instead , a confluence of different pull and push factors has contributed to the upsurge , " the institute 's analysis found			0
" recent @entity6 policies toward unaccompanied children , faltering economies and rising crime and gang activity in @entity73 countries , the desire for family reunification , and changing operations of smuggling networks have all converged			2
" an administration program that defers the deportation of children brought in illegally by their parents or guardians has also had unintended consequences , immigration policy and law experts say			1
although most children pouring over the border now would not qualify for " amnesty , " drug smugglers have used misperceptions about the program to entice kids with the promise of " permisos , " or a pass to stay in @entity6 , homeland security secretary @entity83 told a congressional committee recently			1
inaction by the @entity31 on immigration reform has also exacerbated the problem , experts say			1
such reforms would help stabilize employment prospects for immigrants who left their kids behind			2
as a result , those children might not feel as compelled to flee , experts say			2
should government have seen it coming ? : yes			2
last year , federal agencies noticed an uptick in minors crossing the border — particularly in the @entity28 , according to a report from @entity111 and @entity112			0
the same agencies have also realized those " children present unique operational challenges " for @entity112 and @entity116			0
the administration was also aware that it could n't simply deport them			1
the @entity119 , which was signed into law and reauthorized several times during president @entity122 's administration set guidelines on how to best handle unaccompanied immigrant children			1
in 2008 , the @entity116 was authorized to take over the care of kids , which includes helping meet their health and legal needs , no later than 72 hours after being picked up by the @entity112			0
at a @entity131 hearing last month , federal officials said they were having difficulties meeting the 72 - hour hand off			0
the administration has asked @entity135 to give the @entity112 more leeway in deportation decisions but doing so is murky , immigration advocates say , since it involves a young and vulnerable population			1
what 's being done now ? @entity2 is vowing to act on his own and use his executive authority to sidestep the @entity31 , changes some proponents say could help address the problem			1
should @entity2 use the power of his pen to turn the tide on immigration reform ? @entity2 has discussed @entity5 's role with @entity5 president @entity149 and vice president @entity150 brainstormed strategies with @entity73 leaders in @entity19			1
@entity83 also will travel to @entity19 this summer and he made a public service announcement in @entity154 and @entity155 last month aimed at @entity73 parents			0
he stressed sending children to smugglers who sneak them across the border is dangerous and illegal			0
immigration officials also released graphic ads over the weekend with the same message			0
there is also an effort against drug cartel smuggling rings , and consideration of deploying more @entity112 agents			0
@entity31 to spend millions to curb undocumented children crossing border @entity2 will request more than $ 2 billion from @entity135 to help deal with the problem			1
though now , the administration plans to spend roughly $ 100 million in aid to @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 to help the immigrant children get back home and stay there			1
it also setting aside $ 161.5 million this year for programs designed to help @entity73 countries respond to " pressing security and governance challenges			0
" @entity31 spokesman @entity180 said monday the " law will be enforced			2
" this means children who have been apprehended " will go through the immigration court process " and it 's unlikely that most who do so " will qualify " to stay in the country			2
would an immigration bill have prevented this ? perhaps , immigration law and policy experts say			0
@entity2 likes to blame the @entity31 for not passing a @entity33 immigration bill that also included a path to citizenship for an estimated 8 million of the more than 11 million undocumented workers in the country			1
those reforms would have helped immigrant families become more economically stable			0
those parents , in turn , would have more money to send back home which , as a result , would help eliminate the type of poverty affected kids experience			0
will @entity2 go to the border ? he is in @entity27 for fundraisers and for an economy event this week			2
however , @entity31 officials say he has no plans to visit the border now			2
the @entity31 feels that things are in hand			2
" the president is very aware of the situation that exists on the southwest border , " @entity180 said , noting that other officials have traveled there and what they 've seen " is troubling			0
" @entity27 gov. @entity220 has loudly called for @entity2 to visit the border .			2

partisanship *flares* as *frustrations* mount over surge of undocumented immigrant kids
the problem has *multi-faceted* roots and there were signs that a surge was coming
both the @entity2 administration and @entity135 can do more to stem the problem
the @entity31 says that most children probably wo n't be permitted to stay
