-- a radio host pointed it out to me on my book tour , with alarm : a chapter in my new book -- written three years ago about my president , @entity9 , and his handling of @entity11 , terror and insecurity in @entity14 -- could have been written today , almost word for word			1
" the truth is that i do n't feel safe , " i wrote in " searching for a @entity17			0
" " i , like many others living in @entity14 , will myself to feel safe , knowing i must take the risk and get onto the roads each day ; we have no choice			1
but when it comes to the meat of it , you can not possibly , really feel safe			0
children have been kidnapped ; average @entity14 ' parents , " big men " ( the elite ) , " oyinbos " ( foreigners ) , and celebrities -- from the forbidding @entity34 to the clownish mr. @entity35 -- have been kidnapped ; government officials have been kidnapped , and now youth corps members have been kidnapped			1
" three years later , it has n't gotten even the slightest inch better			0
on 14 april 2014 , it happened again -- like @entity14 had never seen before			1
more than 200 girls were taken from school in the dead of night , by deadly terrorists with @entity11 , in @entity45 , northeastern @entity14			1
it is more than two months later and we are desperate with hopelessness ; we do n't know when the girls will be back or , to hear a former president , @entity50 , tell it , if they will be back at all			1
according to a @entity54 report , the @entity14 military is ( and it hurts deeply to see this ) rendered incompetent based on a collage of factors including corruption , lack of modern training , inadequate equipment and vanished morale			1
the @entity14 government , which is responsible for this state of affairs , has sadly shown no public will to focus on this matter until the girls are brought home			1
first , the president and his men were silent after the kidnap , for about two weeks , until @entity14 took to the streets , and the world paid attention			1
next , it engaged in a shameful back and forth with the equally disappointing governor of @entity78 , the state from which the girls were kidnapped			1
not done , it turned against its own citizens for shaming it into action			0
first , it asked protesters , with dripping disdain , to take their protests to the terrorists			0
then it claimed a # @entity92 protest had been hijacked by the opposition party			0
when all of these threats failed , it moved into action			0
there have been accusations that government buses took touts to disrupt peaceful protests demanding better ; the police commissioner in charge of @entity105 -- forgetting briefly that the military left in 1999 , apparently banned public protest -- although he later denied there was a ban			2
one of the president 's advisers has given himself to farce , branding the informal head of the protests @entity115 -- who co-founded @entity116 , was vice president of the @entity120 's @entity119 division and has heroically given her life to this cause -- as " an opportunist who profits from national tragedy			2
" while all of this is going on , @entity11 continues to brazenly terrorize @entity14			1
on june 18 @entity11 was reported to have abducted 60 females , including children , and killed 30 men in a raid on a village in northeastern @entity14			2
and just as this piece is filed , reports come in of another explosion -- the third this year -- in @entity105 , the nation 's capital , taking the lives of at least 21 people			2
we are , clearly , on our own			0
you hear @entity14 intellectuals say all the time -- sometimes with irritating smugness -- that @entity144 's seminal " the trouble with @entity14 , " written in 1987 when i was two , could have been written today and every word would yet be relevant			1
" the trouble with @entity14 is simply and squarely a failure of leadership , " @entity144 wrote in the book			2
that much is true about the kidnapped @entity151			2
this is why citizens have refused to let # @entity92 die , more than two months after			0
that is why the hashtag continues to dominate conversation , protesters have refused to leave the streets , and why this is almost surely going to be an election issue			0
from the opposition government of @entity78 to the ruling government at the center , citizens will be asking why @entity14 should be punished with incompetent , thoughtless leaders who choose politics over effectiveness , pettiness over responsibility			1
the problem starts from our president			0
we really have to ask @entity9 what he 's up to , i wrote those three years ago			2
it is very difficult to look at our state of affairs at the moment and deliver a vote of confidence			0
officials will have us believe everything is being done behind the scenes -- but governance is not a matter of faith			0
it is a matter of facts			0
we ca n't simply trust that the president has good intentions and knows what he is doing			2
government must be seen to be working			0
a people can not simply have faith in their government ; the government must earn the trust of its people			1
a leader can not afford to amble on , assured in his sense of destiny , without giving the followers that same sense of confidence			0
it is a leader 's duty to lead			0
if our kidnapped girls are not home yet , do not be deceived ; it is not a question solely of international terrorism or porous borders			1
@entity14 's problems go deeper than that -- we are cursed with leaders who can not see beyond their noses , captains with no capacity for vision			1
on # @entity92 , @entity14 desperately need their leaders to lead			1
they will have no peace until they do			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			2

@entity14 " desperate with hopelessness " over kidnapped girls , says @entity224
he *criticizes* the country 's leaders for their *inaction*
" the government must earn the trust of its people , " he says
