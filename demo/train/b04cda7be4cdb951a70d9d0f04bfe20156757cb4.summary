-- do gamers prefer to build or destroy ? a look at the combat - intensive themes of most top - selling console games would suggest the latter			2
but then along came " @entity6 " for @entity7			1
the long - established pc game that focused on building and crafting was released for the @entity7 earlier this month -- and the results should shake the notion that gamers just want to kill something			2
in the first 24 hours of the may 9 release , the @entity16 edition was downloaded more than 400,000 times , smashing the @entity20 's first - day digital sales record and becoming the fastest selling @entity22 title in history			1
@entity24 , the creator of @entity6 , tweeted that this console version of @entity6 was " profitable in an hour			1
" since release , @entity6 has been skyrocketing up @entity28 's weekly activity ranking			1
the most recent numbers place @entity6 in second place , ahead of the first - person shooters " @entity32 : @entity34 , " " @entity33 " and " @entity35 : reach , " in addition to the sports title " @entity38 ' 12			1
" only " @entity32 : @entity40 " remains ahead , for the moment			0
this achievement is not surprising to those familiar with the " @entity6 " mania on the @entity44 , where it was first launched in late 2009 and became a gaming phenomenon			1
in its first 15 months , @entity47 , the gaming company @entity47 built around @entity6 , reported revenues totaling $ 80 million			1
" @entity6 " was not a product of the typical game development and it 's not produced by one of the best - known production companies of the gaming industry			1
instead , it was started by notch -- as he 's known to the game 's fans -- an independent game developer who was willing to experiment with a unique game design , try a risky new online business model and forge a new relationship with gamers			1
he shared his thoughts on this at the official launch for @entity6 in @entity66			1
" when i grew up with games , there was a lot of experimentation going on			0
people would try and create an idea , and not just copy the most successful game out there , " he said			0
" initially i was mostly doing it because of the technical challenge , and then it became fun			0
" @entity78 : @entity6 's pixelated profit machine the game 's formula is not entirely new			1
open world " sandbox " games have been a part of many successful titles			1
this is where the player is not restricted to a particular path , either in the game 's physical world or in the game 's narrative			2
but no one had really taken this concept to the extreme that @entity24 has			0
in " @entity6 , " the player is placed somewhere on a gigantic world at sunrise , and that 's it			1
there is no apparent storyline , mission or purpose , beyond a few tips and achievements			0
players are given a world of their own to do with as they like , which often becomes an addictive adventure of survival , exploration and building			2
this is the core mechanic of " @entity6			1
" the world is composed of blocks that you can remove and replace			0
this is first done in order to survive , as players wall themselves in at night , nervously listening to the creatures roaming nearby			2
but then , if things go well , their imagination takes hold and a simple house becomes a castle , or the @entity129 , or whatever else the player can imagine			0
then full - grown adults spend the next four to six hours in a state of childhood bliss , virtually playing with @entity134 again			2
when @entity24 first released @entity6 to the online public , the game was far from finished , and was still in an early @entity138 stage			2
releasing it at this point held significant risk , he said , as players could dismiss what could be a great game because of the glitches , bugs and the unfinished quality of a pre-beta version			0
instead , the opposite happened			0
" fairly soon , people started talking about it and actually appreciating it , " @entity24 recalled			0
" and ever since then , that 's what kept me going -- people actually liking and playing it			0
" if selling an unfinished game online by himself was n't risky enough , @entity24 took it a step further by making the classic version of the game available free			0
this skyrocketed the game 's popularity , and close to 25 million people have since downloaded the game on their pc			2
more than 5.8 million copies have been purchased			0
another result from this unconventional business model is the relationship it has formed between @entity24 and his fans			0
instead of just being consumers , these early players felt they were a part of the game 's development			2
the game updates felt like gifts to the players , instead of the natural progression toward a title 's release			1
" the players got invested in the testing and the suggestions and the feedback kind of early on and actually started buying the game early , " he said			0
" the way that they talked about the game is definitely why it 's spread so fast , because there was no marketing before that -- just word of mouth			0
" one way players talked about " @entity6 " was through more than 4 million @entity198 videos			1
notch and his team at @entity47 have been very responsive to fan suggestions and ideas , and have also supported the modding community , which has built a host of add - ons for the game			0
this collaboration has created a loyal following that culminated in november with the official launch of " @entity6			1
" most gaming companies hope to build interest and a player base with a successful launch , especially for their first title			0
for " @entity6 , " the company held a convention in @entity66 with 5,000 fans from around the world			1
at this convention @entity220 had a large booth , showing an early playable version of @entity6 for the @entity223			1
as the crowds swelled , with many dressed as creepers and other creatures from the game , the xbox team was surprised by the passion of the fans			0
" the level of excitement of everybody here , to be in the room with the creator of one of their favorite games -- you do n't see that on the same level with any other game title , " said @entity231 , who does marketing for the @entity233 team			0
the @entity7 launch has brought " @entity6 " to the console generation , and initial sales indicate they are quickly joining the ranks of block builders			2
notch has placed " @entity6 's " further development in the hands of his colleague @entity255 , and has turned his sights on developing a space game , tentatively called " 0x10c "			1
not much has been revealed so far , except the promise that he will keep experimenting , an approach he 's already proven can work .			2

@entity44 sensation " @entity6 " becomes an @entity223 best - seller
since may 9 release , " @entity6 " has been downloaded more than 400,000 times
