-- @entity1 was indicted last week on eight counts in the hot - car death of his 22 - month - old son , @entity4			1
@entity1 could face the death penalty if prosecutors decide to seek it and he 's convicted of the most serious charge			2
however , the felony murder charge predicated on second - degree child neglect -- which was the original charge at the probable cause hearing months ago -- still poses the biggest threat to @entity1 ' freedom			1
that , and , of course , the sexting charges , which will likely be the easiest to prove			1
but make no mistake : that felony murder charge will be how the prosecution can convict @entity1 of his son 's murder , even if the killing was unintentional , and , in @entity23 , if the underlying felony was unintentional			1
each of the eight counts plays a key strategic role in maximizing the state 's chances of a conviction against @entity1			1
following is a breakdown of these carefully calculated charges			2
the brilliance of the strategy is in the details			0
murder in @entity23 : most states divide murder into degrees			1
in @entity23 , there 's only one degree of murder , but with very different kinds of killings qualifying as murder			1
in this case , two types of murder are alleged : 1 ) an intentional killing called " malice " murder , and 2 ) " felony murder , " an enigmatic unintentional killing , that is still classified as murder because it is the result of an enumerated felony			1
even more complicated , in this case , two different subcategories of felony murder are alleged using child neglect crimes as the predicate felony			1
any of these convictions carries a minimum life sentence , but only malice murder is eligible for the death penalty			1
count 1 -- malice murder : this is the murder with which we are all familiar			1
it 's the kind committed in the @entity70 , or by @entity71 with the candlestick in the billiard room ; or any of the " murders she wrote			0
" film , literature and even our board games reflect our cultural assumptions about murder -- that it 's an evil crime reserved for the most wicked intent			2
in @entity23 , that 's called malice murder , which is defined as a killing with " malice aforethought , " or intent to kill			1
there are two kinds of malice : express and implied			0
express malice is that deliberate , manifested intention to end another 's life			0
the reality is , however , that direct evidence of deliberate intent is a rarity			0
defendants do n't always volunteer : " i shot the sheriff			0
" it 's quite the opposite			0
nearly all defendants steadfastly maintain their innocence ; they 're more likely to deny shooting the deputy			0
that 's why the law allows for malice to also be implied from the circumstances , as long as the defendant 's behavior demonstrates an " abandoned and malignant heart			0
" whether express or implied , to convict here the prosecution has a heavy burden to prove this mental element			2
that 's why felony murder is a much more appealing and devastating weapon in the charging arsenal			2
counts 2 and 3 -- felony murder ( which are predicated on counts 4 and 5 , respectively ) : felony murder is more of a legal fiction than it is traditional " murder			1
" it is an unintentional killing , but one that happens during the commission of another crime			2
the rationale is that if you commit an inherently dangerous felony , you accept the high possibility that a person will die during the act			2
an example would be that if you were robbing a bank and one of your co-conspirators went crazy and shot a teller and a cop ? well , you 'd be charged with felony murder , even though you did n't pull the trigger			1
you committed a felony , and a death resulted			0
so , to prove felony murder , the prosecution need not prove intent to kill			1
it only need prove : 1 ) commission of the underlying felony and 2 ) a resulting death			1
count 2 is felony murder based upon count 4 : intentional child neglect			1
so , if the defendant acted intending to cause his child cruel and excessive physical pain , and death resulted , he has committed felony " murder " under count 2			1
still the most problematic for this defendant , however , is count 3 , which is the original charge from the preliminary / probable cause hearing			0
this is felony murder predicated on another felony , count 5 , second degree child cruelty			1
but , instead of having to prove the defendant intentionally caused excessive physical pain ( first degree ) , the prosecution here need only prove that he caused pain with criminal negligence ( second degree ) , even if it was unintentional			2
the traditional felonies eligible for felony murder were intentional crimes : burglary , arson , rape , robbery and kidnapping			0
to allow felony murder for an accident seems inconsistent , but @entity23 courts hold that this crime of criminal negligence can be the predicate crime for felony murder			1
that 's right : in @entity23 , you can be convicted of murder -- society 's most heinous crime -- for your unintentional negligence			1
count 6 -- criminal attempt : as a society , we punish not only completed crimes but also attempts to commit crimes			0
it makes sense : suppose a bank robber trips and breaks his leg on his way into the bank with his glock and his president @entity211 mask			0
he is then arrested without even entering the bank to rob it			0
we all agree that he can not escape punishment simply because he 's unsuccessful at robbing banks			0
at the same time , if the would - be robber simply fills up his gas on the way to buy a glock and a @entity211 mask , so he can rob a bank in the future , has he " attempted " a robbery yet ? where 's the line ? to the courts , as long as whatever the defendant does is a " substantial step , " then he 's guilty of attempt			0
here , the attempt is connected not to the death of his child but rather to the alleged sexual exploitation of another minor -- the target of the text messaging			0
counts 7 and 8 -- dissemination of harmful material to minors : to many , these charges seem like they are tacked on , but they are anything but			2
in fact , they are devastating to the defendant tactically			0
here 's why : @entity1 is now additionally charged with knowingly disseminating and furnishing to a minor female sexually explicit printed matter and photographs -- or , as the detective testified at the preliminary hearing : sexting			2
the @entity250 detective testified that while @entity4 was in the car , @entity1 sent a photo of his erect penis to an underage girl and was sexting with several women			2
at that hearing , the defendant had a strong argument that the sexting was improper character evidence ( generally not admissible to prove criminality ) , and more , that evidence that @entity1 was a creep was not admissible on the neglect or murder charges			1
but watch what happens now that he 's been indicted on these charges : evidence supporting the sexting charges is now relevant			1
that evidence will at a minimum cause a jury to dislike @entity1			0
at worst , it will be viewed as motive to be rid of his child			0
second , of all the charges , these are arguably the easiest to prove , thanks to technology			1
did phone 1 send something to phone 2 ? was that something considered " harmful material " ? was a recipient a minor ? most of those elements can be established with phone records and a birth certificate			0
as for the " harmful material , " so far , if the allegations are true , it sounds like it could fit			0
ultimately , this is hardly a scatter - shot indictment			2
each charge plays a vital role , but the most potentially damaging is still the same charge from the preliminary hearing : the felony murder based upon the second - degree criminal neglect			2
after all , whether you condemn this defendant or sympathize with him , there is a preliminary consensus that at minimum he did something tragically and massively careless			0
and under modern law , that is apparently what we call " murder			0

@entity310 was charged in eight - count indictment in hot car death case
@entity314 : the counts are *structured* to maximize the chance of a conviction
@entity314 : in @entity23 , even an unintentional act can be grounds for murder conviction
he says sexting charges will be easiest to prove and could influence entire case
