@entity0 , @entity1 -- we were scheduled to speak with @entity4 just after his sound check for a concert in @entity0 to benefit the city 's public libraries			1
we pulled into the parking structure 45 minutes early when my cell phone rang			0
it was @entity4 's publicist			1
@entity4 has been playing the banjo for decades			1
his new album is a collection of bluegrass tunes			1
" hey , where are you ? " she asked urgently			0
" we 're in the garage , " i replied			0
" can you get up here quickly ? he 's ready			2
" a musician ready early ? there goes his street cred			0
interviewing @entity4 can be like an awkward first date			1
like many comedians , he 's polite , but he sometimes struggles to make eye contact , gives monosyllabic answers and leaves the impression that he wants to be anywhere but talking to you			2
but when the subject is his new album , " @entity37 : new songs for the @entity39 , " he 's chatty , enthusiastic and engaged			1
on the @entity41 , the comic / actor / novelist / playwright / musician shows off his picking skills as well as his ability to craft witty bluegrass songs with titles such as " hoedown at @entity47 's , " " @entity48 " and " @entity49			1
" it 's been his passion for 45 of his 63 years			2
this past weekend , the ultimate @entity53 hyphenate made his debut at the @entity55			1
" @entity37 " has received more than respectable reviews , but that 's not surprising , given @entity4 's uncanny ability to excel in whatever he does -- except maybe idle chitchat			1
the following is an edited version of the interview : @entity2 : people know you as a versatile artist , but now it 's about the banjo and your bluegrass album , " @entity37 : new songs for the @entity39			1
" @entity4 : i did a lot of things when i first started out			1
in order to be in show business , i juggled , i did magic tricks , cards tricks and i played the banjo			2
@entity2 : you 've been playing it for 45 years , right ? @entity4 : yes , i have			1
it 's a long time , and i remember when i was going through a particularly difficult time of learning , i 'd go , " well , if i just stick with it , one day i 'll be saying , ' i 've been playing for 40 years			2
' " @entity2 : picking up the banjo might seem likely if you grew up in the @entity86 -- maybe @entity87 or somewhere down @entity88			2
but you grew up in @entity90 , @entity1			0
this is the @entity92 @entity4 : there was a lot of musical activity in @entity92 in the 1960s			1
there were the @entity99 , and @entity100 would come by , @entity97 , all these different players			0
i also had this friend , @entity102 , in high school , and he played , and he actually produced this album now -- 45 years later			2
[ @entity102 is a founding member of country - bluegrass group , the @entity105			2
] @entity2 : is n't @entity102 the one who taught you how to do an " @entity108 " tuning on the banjo ? @entity4 : yes , he did			1
@entity2 : see , i read your @entity41 liner notes			0
[ both laugh ] there 's a cute little story in there about taking a photo of the three things you love most -- your wife , your dog and the banjo			1
@entity4 : well , we all love more things that that			1
i just happened to take a photo , and there was my wife , my dog and my banjo , all in the same shot -- and i thought , " oh , that 's like a family portrait right there			1
" @entity2 : sounds like your next @entity137 card to me			0
... you 're playing a benefit for the @entity140			0
@entity4 : as you can see , it 's sold out [ gestures to an empty room ]			1
... you know , it 's also a little bit sneaky , because doing a benefit takes the pressure off having to be so great			2
this is the first time i 've really played banjo live as a concert -- ever			2
i mean , i 've played a song or two , but i 've never done a dozen songs , so i hope people will be forgiving			0
@entity2 : are you nervous at all ? @entity4 : i 'm a little nervous			1
@entity2 : really ? a little butterfly or two ? i 'm surprised			0
@entity4 : no butterflies , but it 's very different playing music onstage if you 're not used to it			1
i mean , doing comedy is one thing			2
i used to get nervous on that , but i was very practiced			0
i 'm as practiced as i can be			0
i 'm performing with the @entity164 , a group i met in @entity165			0
they 're a renowned bluegrass group -- young men who play and sing really , really well			2
i 'm lucky to have them			0
@entity2 : you 've won three @entity171 and an @entity172			0
you do all kinds of things -- a modern - day renaissance man			0
@entity4 : well , in a strange way , i do n't have a job , so i have a lot of time on my hands			1
when i do work , it might be very concentrated , and it might be months where you 're not really doing anything except maybe playing the banjo or writing something			2
you know , there 's a lot of time in the day if you 're not working 9 to 5			2
@entity2 : writing books , writing plays , doing comedy , writing music ? @entity4 : it 's been a long life			1
@entity2 : so have you decided whether you 're going to embark on a full - fledged tour ? @entity4 : i 'm kind of seeing if -- you know , i have n't really performed for a long , long time -- 30 years live onstage			1
you know , i 've done things like host the @entity204 and things like that			0
but it 's a little different			2
you have to get comfortable , you really have to know what you 're doing , and it has to be almost boring to you to be able to do it well			0
you have to be so confident			0
i need to get some shows under my belt just to feel really good about it			0
@entity2 : they always say comedians are the least confident people in the entertainment industry			0
do you feel like you 're not confident ? @entity4 : no , i feel confident , but i know what they mean because when you tell a joke , it might last six seconds , and then you have to tell another joke			1
but a song lasts three minutes , and then you have another song for three minutes and you 've killed six minutes			0
in that time , a comedian does 360 jokes			0
might not be the right math but anyway			0
@entity2 : when you guest - hosted " @entity228 " in january , you performed one of the songs on your new album -- which you immediately made available on the @entity232			1
@entity4 : it was an exclusive release on @entity234 because i knew i was doing " snl , " and i wanted the record to be available , and the only way you could get it available that quickly was electronically			1
and now it 's out on @entity241 in a more normal release now			2
@entity2 : are you a big @entity244 guy who downloads stuff constantly ? @entity4 : i do , a lot			1
i find a lot of songs that way			0
i use the @entity250 a lot to find music			0
i always download it legally -- especially my own songs			0
[ @entity255 ] i think it 's very important to keep that honor among yourselves			0
@entity2 : who do you find a lot of your fans are musically ? are they people who have followed your career from the early days of " snl " ? @entity4 : i honestly do n't know			1
i do n't know if there are any fans			0
i know that the record sold really well on @entity234 , but you know there 's a bluegrass audience for bluegrass music , and there 's probably an audience that wants to see , " ok , let 's see if this idiot can play			1
" @entity2 : can you ? @entity4 : we 'll see tonight			1
[ @entity255 ] i do have a record out .			0
