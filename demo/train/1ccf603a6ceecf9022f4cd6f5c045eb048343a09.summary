@entity5 , @entity3 @entity2 militants have killed scores in a series of raids on dozens of villages in northeast @entity3 's @entity10 , continuing its violent campaign of terror in the @entity14 nation , a lawmaker said			1
for two weeks , @entity2 gunmen have sacked dozens of villages in @entity17 district , close to the border with @entity19 , slaughtering male residents and abducting others , said @entity22 , a lawmaker representing @entity17 district in the @entity10 state @entity25			1
" they move house to house , killing people -- including the old , abducting women , and children and burning homes , " @entity26 said tuesday			0
he said villages are littered with bodies , and there is no one to bury them because residents have fled -- thousands of them , heading off into the mountains or across the border into @entity19 -- to escape the onslaught			1
" they slaughter people like animals , " he said			0
‎ " now , 70 % of the people in the district have been dislodged from the homes			0
some of them have run into the mountains , while others have crossed into @entity19 or fled to @entity51 , " the capital of @entity10 , @entity26 said			0
the villagers ' ordeal is horrific but , sadly , nothing new for @entity2			2
the terrorist group , its name translating as " @entity58 education is sin , " has been a force in @entity3 for years			2
it tries to use religion to justify its actions , which are aimed at imposing its strict version of of @entity66 law in @entity3 , which is split between a majority @entity68 north and a mostly @entity71 south			2
@entity2 has intensified its attacks in recent years , standing defiant against the @entity3 military			1
and it has n't gone after only government troops or officials , with civilians often becoming victims			0
the group has been tied to a spate of assassinations , market bombings , attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques and raids of villages , including those earlier this month in @entity17 district			2
@entity90 kidnappings have also been part of its playbook , most notoriously the taking of more than 200 schoolgirls from @entity96 last april			0
boys and young men have been abducted as well , including 40 between the ages of 10 and 23 reportedly taken captive on @entity100 in @entity101 , and 97 others kidnapped in and around the village of @entity104 in august			0
and whether or not they were former captives , @entity2 may be boasting about its use of child soldiers in its fight			1
an organization calling itself @entity2 's official mouthpiece this week even promoted an alleged military training camp for children on its @entity114 feed , posting images of children in formation holding @entity119 weapons			1
while @entity4 can not independently verify the authenticity of the photos , intelligence sources said the images appear to be real and are consistent with the @entity126 extremist group 's strategy of forcibly recruiting and training children			2
and the @entity128 lent credibility to the report by tweeting a photo of the young , heavily armed children along with these words : " amid its massacres of innocents , @entity2 running training camps for child soldiers			1
" the release of these photos and the new @entity114 account appear to coincide with an ever - more sophisticated media strategy on the part of @entity2			1
the change in tactics appears to emulate @entity145 , even down to the use of @entity148 chants , or nasheeds			0
last week , a video was posted on the same account purporting to be an interview with @entity2 's spokesman			1
both the interviewer and the subject were masked and the production values were far more sophisticated than anything the terror group has published before			0
@entity2 's campaign has left thousands of @entity3 in danger -- in some cases with the central government and others seemingly unable to help			1
the latest bloodshed began in @entity17 township , which @entity2 took over in september and declared to be part of its caliphate			2
the insurgents then moved into villages including @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity26 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176			0
humanitarian workers have been unable to reach residents who fled into the mountains , said @entity180 , head of the @entity181 for northeast @entity3			1
" we are aware there are people trapped in the mountains but they are inaccessible			0
the security situation is a challenge in reaching them and offering them humanitarian assistance , " @entity180 said			0
@entity26 said the military has not responded to complaints that he and other community leaders lodged , calling for its intervention			0
" sometimes we alert the military when they are advancing on villages before they attack , but no action is taken to stop them , " he said			2
" these insurgents have been killing with impunity			0
when they attack a village , they will sleep there for the night after the slaughter and move on the next morning , " the lawmaker said			0
there has been no reaction from the military to @entity26 's specific allegation			1
@entity207 on wednesday leveled a similar accusation , saying it had evidence that the @entity3 military was warned repeatedly about impending @entity2 attacks on civilians late last year on @entity213 and @entity214			1
" these attacks are an urgent wake - up call for the @entity3 leadership , the @entity219 and the international community , " said @entity207 's @entity215			1
" it is essential to protect hundreds of thousands of civilians in northeast @entity3 from @entity2 's continued onslaught			1
" the @entity3 @entity224 responded by calling the allegation " misleading , " saying that @entity207 's use of " these unfortunate activities of terrorists to find fault with the counterterrorism operations , as usual , is inaccurate and unfair			1
" the @entity224 said its forces have enhanced their intelligence abilities , troop deployment and coordination , and logistics capabilities			0
" in actual fact , the protection of civilian populations is the essence of the entire counterterrorism operation , " the ministry said			0
" ... indeed , the troops were prepared and duly engaged the terrorists in all the instances referred to by @entity207			2
" journalist @entity246 reported from @entity3 , and @entity4 's @entity247 wrote this report from @entity249			1
@entity4 's @entity250 contributed to this report .			0
