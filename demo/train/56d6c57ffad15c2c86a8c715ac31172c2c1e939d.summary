-- heading into wednesday , majorities of @entity2 in virtually every major poll predicted president @entity4 would come out on top in this year 's presidential debates			1
even majorities of @entity8 and @entity10 supporters thought the @entity8 nominee was in for a rough night			2
but not all of them			0
at a time when most surrogates were competing in the traditional expectations - setting limbo contest that always precedes presidential debates , @entity14 gov. @entity13 predicted that @entity10 , seasoned veteran of roughly 20 debates within the past year alone , would prevail			2
" wednesday night 's the restart of this campaign , " he told @entity20			2
" come thursday morning , the entire narrative of this race is going to change			0
" no matter how the narrative looks moving forward , there 's no question @entity10 claimed it in @entity29 on wednesday night			1
5 things we learned from the presidential debate he did n't just score wins on the margins , holding his own against the president ; he won big			0
since the question of which candidate did better in a presidential debate was first asked by @entity39 in 1984 , no candidate has ever scored more than 60 % on the question , until wednesday night , when 67 % of the voters in @entity0 's post-debate poll gave @entity10 the edge			1
it was a relatively placid debate with few direct confrontations , virtually no sustained attacks , and occasionally no attacks at all , on some of @entity10 's most vulnerable areas			1
voters finally tuning in to the race for the first time on wednesday would leave without hearing most of the themes that have dominated the trail since the race began			0
funniest tweets about the debate a lengthy discussion of entitlement spending , and a follow - up segment devoted to the role of government , rolled by without a single mention of @entity10 's 47 % remarks			1
a discussion of high finance and companies that ship jobs overseas passed without a mention of @entity70 , a topic that had dominated the @entity4 campaign 's messaging for months and seemed to have done @entity10 real damage in key swing states like @entity76			1
@entity10 spent weeks before the debate practicing , leaving nothing to chance , from his body language to every one - liner in his arsenal			2
and it showed : he did n't have to reach for answers or decide how to handle debate stage dynamics			0
his performance came across like the campaign equivalent of muscle memory			2
connecting with the viewer : ' @entity10 was able to out @entity4 ' @entity4 's answers were long and winding , featuring more than their fair share of provisos and to - be - sures , even a bit hesitant			1
@entity10 's were direct , confident and black - and - white			1
as his team had hinted before the debate , he claimed the fact - checking mantle as his own , deflecting attention from a string of previously debunked statements by aiming the truth - stretching accusation at @entity4 , and masterfully working in a passing reference to the president 's lifestyle that seemed designed to reduce the advantage his own wealth had given his opponent : " mr. president , you 're entitled to your own house and your own airplane , but not your own facts			1
" that particular jab seemed to beg for a pointed response about privilege that never came			0
not only did @entity10 put @entity4 on the defensive , at times , the president seemed to put himself there , raising and responding to conservative attacks that had n't yet been mentioned			2
the imbalance in the performances immediately showed up in polls after the debate ended : @entity10 , at least for the night , erased deficits and regained ground he 'd lost on key questions			0
by double - digit advantages , the registered voters in @entity0 's poll said he came across as the better leader and better on the economy			0
read a transcript of the debate on the likeability question -- where the president 's held the edge all year , generally by a double - digit advantage -- @entity10 closed the gap : 46 % said he was the more likeable candidate , to 45 % who said the same of @entity4			1
still there were some hints of strategies that might make re-appearances in future debates			0
with a more aggressive posture , @entity4 's demands for policy details from @entity10 could draw blood			1
one of the biggest advantages @entity10 has on the president is the fact that @entity4 has four years of proposals to critique and a track record of both successes and failures			2
@entity10 has had no track record , no time in office , since well before the financial crisis began			0
and by releasing as few details as possible about most of his policy plans , he 's been able to make ambitious promises that far outstrip any achievement someone in office would be able to match in a real - world environment			0
a sustained push by the president could pose questions his plans are n't yet specific enough to answer			0
at crossroads of economic crisis , debate disappoints and the president 's comeback to @entity10 's assurance to current @entity183 patients that their own care would remain unaffected under his plan highlighted the glaring political weak spot : " if you 're 54 or 55 , you might want to listen , ' cause this , this will affect you , " said @entity4			1
but for the moment , @entity10 's regained the momentum , re-energizing his base while the president faces the sort of second - guessing his opponent had been battling for the past month			1
the question is whether the flash polls are recording a flash in the pan , or whether , with roughly a month left in the race , the governor can translate his performance into the sort of healthy , sustained bounce that eluded him after the @entity8 convention			0
complete coverage of @entity0 's @entity205			0

no candidate has ever scored above 60 % on question of who won -- @entity10 scored 67 %
@entity10 's answers were direct , confident and black - and - white
@entity4 's performance was long and windy , even a bit hesitant
@entity4 's campaign now faces second - guessing that @entity10 's was before wednesday
