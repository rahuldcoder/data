@entity0 -- it was 10 p.m. on sunday and 22 - year - old @entity3 , a dancer , was supposed to be in her room doing homework			1
but when she saw mobile @entity7 updates of police tear gassing pro-democracy protesters in downtown @entity0 , she was too agitated to study			1
grabbing her smartphone , she followed online postings to the protest site itself -- and soon had tear gas fired at her as well			1
only then did she peel her eyes from her mobile device			1
" while we were waging battle , we screamed out news to each other , " she tells @entity1			2
" but before and after , i 'd update people on the @entity22			2
" it 's a high - tech response to a high - stress situation			1
armed with top - of - the - line phones on some of the world 's fastest mobile networks , @entity0 's young protesters are able to organize themselves at a lightning pace older generations of activists could have only dreamed of			1
" the internet is a critical reason these protests have exploded so quickly and so out of control , " says @entity3			1
" we all want instant news , and people are very unsettled			0
" barely an hour after @entity3 was sprayed by tear gas , many young people , clutching glowing smartphones , used group chat apps like @entity43 and @entity44 to set up a splinter protest some five kilometers ( three miles ) north of @entity0 's downtown @entity46			1
just before the clock struck midnight sunday , at least 1,000 protesters -- many heeding messages that had been posted online just minutes before -- suddenly flooded the main road in @entity0 's @entity53 shopping district , leaving police surprised and outnumbered			1
then , in a coordinated move , dozens of young protesters parked vans and trucks in a tight formation , protectively surrounding protesters			1
the police seemed unable to respond , and withdrew from the scene			0
along with many other parts of @entity0 , @entity53 remains occupied with protesters monday evening			1
crowd confusion as protesters develop new ways to organize themselves online , it 's become less clear who is leading			1
last night , student protest leaders -- including high school striker @entity71 -- asked supporters to go home out of safety , but thousands of protesters continued joining protests after midnight			1
rumors of an impending crackdown have also added to the confusion			1
one message forwarded to @entity1 contained a cell phone recording of a young man who claimed to be the son of a police officer			0
" there will be 2,000 to 3,000 riot policemen tonight , " said the voice			0
" please spread this , just do n't quote my name			0
" another image briefly sparked panic sunday night , purporting to show @entity94 military vehicles moving in toward the protest			0
they turned out to be photos from an unrelated date			0
to try and calm nerves , a group of 11 journalism students at the @entity101 started a @entity7 page with minute - by - minute protest updates that they claim to have verified			2
the page , launched less than 24 hours ago , already has over 70,000 followers			0
" not many of our friends really believe what they see on tv any more , " says @entity106 , 23 , who helps run the @entity7 page			0
" but there are a lot of rumors causing panic on the internet			2
" " right now we just want to verify information , so people do n't get confused			0
" locals are n't the only ones looking for news , though			0
one group of volunteers has used social media to translate protest updates into thirteen languages , using the hashtag # @entity126 -- a reference to the umbrellas used by @entity0 's protesters to shield against pepper spray			1
' what 's terrifying is , we 're not scared ' despite the sophistication of their tools and the efficiency of their actions , students like @entity134 and @entity3 share a sense that the world they know is falling apart			2
" it 's such a shock for me and my friends , " says @entity134			2
" we have been living such a normal , protected , and comfortable life in @entity0			1
we never thought there would be tear gas explosions			0
' " @entity3 says it 's frightening how quickly young people have adapted to chaos as a new normal			1
at first , she said her group of friends were scared of being arrested , then they were scared of pepper spray and then they feared being tear gassed			2
" what 's terrifying is , we 're increasingly not scared -- and the police may have to deploy more terrible weapons to scare us			2
" the fear of bloodshed is perhaps felt most painfully by @entity0 's older generation , who still have memories of @entity161 etched into their minds			1
@entity3 plays a @entity43 voice message she was forwarded last night , from her former high school teacher			0
" @entity168 students , this is your teacher , i 'm safe right now , please do n't worry , " the woman says steadily			0
suddenly , her voice wavers and cracks with emotion			0
" but please , listen to me , do n't come out any more , you are just high school students			0
you should n't have to face these scenes , please go home			0
" because i do n't want anything to happen to you , " she continues , now crying			0
" if you are at the protest right now and you can hear the sound of my voice , please leave immediately , because we just do n't know what 's going to happen next			2
