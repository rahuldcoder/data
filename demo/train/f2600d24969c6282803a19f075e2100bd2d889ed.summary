@entity0 , @entity1 -- oil - tainted seas , oxygen - deprived zones , overfishing , mercury poisoning ... these days , the search for safe and ethical seafood is enough to unnerve any pescetarian			1
for chefs , it does n't just mean crossing another fish off our menus			2
the question has become how do we keep fish on the food chain ? i found one answer last year , at a fish farm called @entity21			1
@entity21 is in southwestern @entity22 , at the tip of the @entity24			1
until the 1980s , the land was in the hands of the @entity27			0
they once raised cattle in what were essentially wetlands , and they did it by draining the land			2
they built a series of canals and siphoned the water off the land and into the river			2
but they could n't make it work			0
economically and ecologically , it was a disaster			2
in draining the land , they killed 90 percent of the bird population			2
and so in 1982 , a company with an environmental conscience purchased the land			0
what did they do ? they reversed the direction of water flow in the canals ; they literally flipped the switch			1
instead of using the channels to pump water out , they pulled water in , flooding the canals and creating a 27,000 - acre fish farm of sea bass , mullet , eels , shrimp and sole			1
in doing so , the company reversed the process of ecological destruction the farm is incredible , with hundreds of miles of flooded canals and thick marshland , teeming with life			2
i stood there not so long ago with @entity77 , @entity21 's head biologist			2
according to @entity79 , it 's such a rich environment that the fish eat what they 'd be eating in the wild			1
because the system is so healthy , it 's totally self - renewing			1
but @entity21 is not just a fish farm ; it 's also a bird sanctuary			1
today there are 600,000 birds on the farm from 250 species			1
it 's become one of the most important private estates for bird life in @entity96			1
you might think a thriving bird population is the last thing you 'd want on a fish farm ( @entity21 loses 20 percent of fish eggs and baby fish to the birds ) , but for @entity79 , it 's a point of pride and a testament to the company 's success			1
" we farm extensively , not intensively , " he told me			2
" it 's an ecological network			0
so the healthier the birds , the better the system			0
" but the truest measure of their success is much simpler : flavor			0
@entity21 's fish was the most delicious i 'd ever tasted , starting with the skin			1
i do n't like fish skin -- not seared or crispy			1
i almost never cook with it			0
yet when i tasted it at @entity21 , it tasted not at all like fish skin			0
it tasted sweet and clean , like taking a bite of the ocean			0
i mentioned it to @entity79 , and he nodded			0
" the skin acts like a sponge , " he explained			0
" it 's the last defense before entering the body , and it evolved to soak up impurities			0
but there are almost no impurities in our water			0
" and that 's an understatement			0
the water flows into the canals from the @entity24 , carrying all the things rivers tend to carry these days -- chemical contaminants and pesticide runoff -- and when it flows back out , it 's cleaner than when it started			1
the system is so healthy it purifies the water			1
the purification is not just for the fish , but for us as well			0
that river water eventually dumps into the @entity153			0
sure , it 's a drop in the bucket , but i 'll take it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			1

with *compromised* , overfished seas , @entity159 *puzzled* over how to keep fish on food chain
he says he visited fish farm in @entity22 that *restored* water flow , fish populations to wetlands
the farm is ecologically *balanced* , with *abundant* fish and 250 bird species , he says
@entity159 : the farm 's system is healthy again -- and the fish it produces are delicious
