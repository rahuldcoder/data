@entity0 -- dressed in yellow full - body sanitation suits , members of the @entity3 combed through tents in the @entity7 camp saturday , taking down ones violating park policies			1
the owners of the tossed tents and other protesters were agitated by the move , but there was little unrest at @entity16 in downtown @entity0			1
park police in riot gear first entered at dawn saturday , and said they were not there to evict protesters , but to check for compliance with " no camping " laws			1
still , at one point , there was a confrontation between protesters and riot police			1
the move comes after a federal judge tuesday rejected an @entity7 demonstrator 's request to keep park police from enforcing a ban on camping in @entity16 and nearby @entity35			1
living in a public park as a means of protest is not protected by the @entity40 , judge @entity36 ruled			2
the operation was a success and a majority of those in the park cooperated with police , park police spokesman @entity41 said			2
eight people were arrested in the confrontation with police , he said			1
four for failure to obey a lawful order , and three for crossing a police line			2
another person was arrested for felony assault on an officer and assault with a deadly weapon after @entity41 said the man threw a brick at one of the officers			1
the officer was treated at a hospital for non-life - threatening injuries , @entity41 said			2
" the @entity3 continue to support the right of people to exercise their constitutionally protected rights , " he said			1
protesters heckled him as he briefed reporters early saturday			2
as he spoke , the officer was interrupted by someone who made a rooster sound , and others made ghost - like noises in the background			0
" in some of the tents we found urine - soaked bedding materials , bottles of urine , " noted @entity41			0
" in some of the tents we found some dead rats			0
we also found some live rats , with some rat families			0
" authorities told protesters monday that they had to remove camping gear such as sleeping bags and housekeeping materials , but could keep their tents as long as one flap remains open at all times			0
on saturday , police began removing the tents from the park that had camping gear inside			1
protesters complained and accused the officers of taking down tents that were not in violation			0
at the outset of their search , police found only one compliant tent , and took down there rest			0
once the inspection is complete , the park will be reopened to the public , @entity41 said			0
@entity7 is part of a larger activist movement that began last year in @entity112 and quickly spread across the country			1
while the protesters have highlighted a number of causes , the overarching theme has remained largely the same : populist anger over what activists portray as an out - of - touch corporate , financial and political elite			0
@entity1 's @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 contributed to this report .			0
