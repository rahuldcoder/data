-- at a time when the @entity3 is trying to figure out how to respond to threats from @entity6 leaders , @entity3 and @entity7 are synthesizing their intelligence assessments of @entity10 's nuclear capability , and @entity3 are marking the 10th anniversary of the @entity13 war , it is useful to remind ourselves of the central role that intelligence plays in trying to understand our nation 's greatest threat , an enemy armed with weapons of mass destruction			1
whether this intelligence turns out to be accurate or inaccurate , when trying to figure out the capabilities and intentions of hostile countries , our leaders turn to clandestinely collected information simply because they have no other way of knowing			2
but it is also worth remembering that the picture that intelligence paints is not a factual depiction			2
with solid sources and analysis rigorously tested for bias , it can be very good			0
but a lack of these can produce intelligence analysis that is far less certain and therefore open for interpretation from policymakers			2
the general public is not aware of the quality of our nation 's intelligence at any given moment because it is not shared with the public , and we are forced to rely on the president 's representation of the information			1
not an ideal situation for a democracy -- and one that proved disastrous in the case of the @entity57			1
as an intelligence analyst at the @entity60 , i was privy to all the intelligence analysis on @entity13 in the lead - up to that war			0
my office covered the country analysis while other offices covered wmd and terrorism , but we read each other 's work			0
i remember thinking at the time how paradoxical it was that we were working so hard to be thorough in our analysis for the president , but then he gave the public only a few pieces of raw intelligence reporting from a handful of sources as well as the administration 's own judgments that did not reflect the complexity of our assessments			1
thus the general public was given only the intelligence the @entity89 administration judged was most useful to characterize the danger of @entity92 's regime			1
this was done by unilaterally declassifying secret intelligence for speeches , talk show appearances and @entity99 's famous @entity98 speech			0
there is a far better way to give the public a more accurate reading of threats to our national security			0
one need n't look any further than the @entity108			0
the framers created @entity110 to be another body , unaccountable to the executive , to be entrusted with the nation 's security and with the exclusive power to make war			1
but for @entity110 to play this role in today 's @entity68 reality , congressional leaders need to have access to the same intelligence the president has			1
this would allow @entity110 to challenge a president 's characterization of a threat with the public ( as well as call out a president if he is n't addressing a threat )			1
this would provide the public a more accurate understanding of the real threats it faces and with that a greater certainty as to when we need to act			0
while some congressional members on the intelligence committees are getting more intelligence information today than they were before , the president 's @entity136 , with information from the nation 's most sensitive sources , is still for presidential eyes only			0
this puts the president in the driver 's seat to define our threats , determine our enemies and tell the public what he thinks we need to do about it			0
in the case of the @entity13 war , by the time @entity110 began to take a more active role and summoned the now infamous @entity157 , they were not in a position to function as a " balance " to the executive branch and " check " that branch 's characterization of @entity92 as an imminent threat			1
the @entity89 administration had already released most of the damning intelligence to the public , creating enough fear to convince many @entity3 that @entity92 was " very likely " to give @entity68 to terrorists			1
it would have been far better to have trusted the public with the @entity60 analysts ' full assessments than for the individual , sometimes uncorroborated pieces of raw intelligence to be released to the public without any analysis or context			2
the public would have had to wrestle with the complexity , the uncertainties and in some cases the limited availability of sources that was the intelligence picture on @entity13 in 2002 - 2003			2
i am not advocating for this type of complete intel - sharing with the public in the future			0
releasing top secret information to the public risks lives and collection methods and is clearly unwise			0
@entity110 , as the body representing the public , can and should serve this function			1
but unless @entity110 ' access to intelligence is on par with the president 's , you can forget what you read in the @entity108 ; information is power and the branch with the most classified intelligence is king and alone makes war			1
@entity110 , and by default , the public , are largely irrelevant			1
fear should not compel us to go to war			0
a decision of that consequence should only follow a rigorous debate among all of our leaders on the necessity for war based on the best information available			0
and while they 're at it , a debate on the quality of that information as well			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			2

@entity222 : in major foreign policy decisions , intelligence plays a key role
presidents get the fullest *description* of what intelligence agencies know
*failure* to share intelligence fully *misled* the public in advance of @entity57 , she says
@entity220 : presidents should fully inform @entity110 of relevant intelligence
