twenty years ago , april 5 , 1992 , @entity0 and @entity1 were shot and killed in @entity2			2
they were the shots heard around the world and they started the @entity6			1
i covered that war , and many colleagues are gathering in @entity2 now to commemorate what took hundreds of thousands of lives , left so many more wounded , and created millions of refugees			2
this was the war that introduced us to the term " ethnic cleansing			2
" the dominant @entity19 power at the time , @entity17 wanted to keep @entity20 together , and failing that , to carve out ethnically pure areas in the breakaway states to create a @entity17			1
it was a horrible fantasy that sought to destroy an ethnically mixed , intermarried community that had lived peacefully and progressively together in @entity26			1
this war was defining for the region , for the world and for those of us who covered it			1
see some amazing photos from the war we witnessed the heroic resistance of a population under siege and shelling and sniping for nearly four years			2
we learned the pain of watching men , women and children brutally slaughtered			1
these were the non-combatants , casually targeted in the crosshairs of the sniper 's rifle , blown apart by mortar shells when they went to collect water , bread , fuel or even heading to school			0
we learned the bitter cynicism of the international community that refused for some time to intervene , the @entity55 and its allies finding every which way , and every tortured rhetorical device -- including refusing to use the word genocide -- to avoid getting off the sidelines			1
i will never forget going to the funerals , one for a little girl called @entity64			0
@entity2 had run short of everything even the letter " a " so @entity64 's grave marker could not be spelled correctly			0
i will never forget the mothers and fathers who would try to brave the siege around @entity2 airport , then try to make a dash to the other side where in one village they could buy or scrounge some fresh fruit or vegetables , anything to complement the meager rations and dried food the humanitarian airlift would bring			0
the night i was out there , a father managed to find a single apple for his child			0
for that he had risked his life			0
on friday more than 11,000 empty chairs will be arranged in silent poignant and powerful memory of @entity2 's war dead			0
along with the citizens of @entity2 and other besieged @entity26 towns and villages , many of our colleagues were killed and wounded			1
and who will ever forget the death camps , the skeletal prisoners who evoked the terrible crimes of @entity101 ? but this was at the end of the 20th century			0
this was the satellite age			0
we were there and we reported the story day in and day out , week after week , month ... year after year			0
this was the era of " never again " and it was happening again -- ethnic cleansing and genocide here in our own backyard , and on our watch			1
we fought back with all the power of our media			0
for me , @entity26 was where i learned about the truth			1
horrified when the do - nothing crowd suggested i was taking sides , or losing my objectivity , i was forced to confront this charge , and examine our @entity124			2
here in @entity26 i determined that in the face of unspeakable crimes and the most serious violations of international humanitarian order , there is no moral equivalence , no blurring the line between victim and aggressor			1
objectivity means giving all sides a fair hearing			2
it does not mean drawing a false moral equivalence			1
in this case there is no one - hand - or - the other			0
and anyone who seeks to hide under that calumny is not just a liar , but an accessory , in this case to genocide			0
it is the lesson of my lifetime			0
as we all know , tens of thousands of deaths later including at @entity152 in the summer of 1995 , the worst massacre in @entity150 since @entity101 , the @entity55 finally intervened with @entity155 allies , ended the war and launched the peace that holds to this day			0
no country , no crisis , is the same			2
of course @entity160 is not @entity26 , nor is it @entity161 , but in @entity160 today a heavily armed military is besieging and slaughtering ordinary civilians and outgunned rebels too as the state tries to crush an uprising			1
just like in @entity26 , the @entity160 rebels / opposition have been denied the right to self defense , for fear of " accelerating the conflict on the ground and making it worse			1
" just like in @entity26 when the @entity55 and its allies said they could not intervene " because it 's a civil war and all sides are equally guilty , " ( although that was not the case as there was a clear aggressor ) in @entity160 today they say they " do n't know who to help , who to arm , the opposition is fragmented			1
" the lesson of @entity26 is that our democratic and free world which seeks to uphold the highest values bestowed on humankind , could no longer watch as ordinary civilians were butchered			1
it 's a lesson that took too long to implement , and the peace is not perfect , but at least the killing stopped .			0

@entity198 : @entity26 was where i learned objectivity does not mean drawing a false moral equivalence
@entity198 : no crisis is the same but in @entity160 the military is fighting a heavily outgunned opposition
@entity198 : in @entity26 the time came when the world could no longer watch as civilians were butchered
