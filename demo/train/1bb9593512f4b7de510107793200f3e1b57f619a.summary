@entity0 -- school bullying is the target of a two - day summit in @entity0 that kicked off wednesday morning with education secretary @entity5 saying bullying undermines learning in schools			1
" it is an absolute travesty of our educational system when students fear for their safety at school , worry about being bullied , or suffer discrimination , taunts , because of their ethnicity , their religion , sexual orientation , disability , or host of other reasons , " said @entity5			2
just under a third of students ages 12 - 18 reported that they had been bullied in school in a recent study by the @entity28			1
the study , done during the 2007 - 2008 school year , found that the harassment predominantly came in the form of " being made fun of " and " being the subject of rumors			2
" bullying differs from teasing , according to @entity36 with the @entity38 's @entity37 , which is hosting the first - ever summit on bullying			1
one reason is that bullying generally involves a power imbalance , he said			0
. " the key thing that defines bullying versus teasing is that bullying has ... an impact on the student 's ability to achieve and to want to be at school , " @entity36 said			0
" teasing sometimes is unpleasant but ( if ) it escalates to the point where you actually see students do worse in school or actually avoid areas in school or avoid coming to school , then it goes from teasing to bullying			0
" the bullying summit , which is being attended by government officials as well as superintendents , researchers , corporate leaders and students , looks to come up with a national plan to reduce and end bullying			1
" part of the reason we are focusing on bullying is we want to intervene in this cycle early on , before it escalates to harassment and violence and we have horrible incidents like we 've all seen on the evening news that terrifies every parent in @entity80 , " @entity36 said .			0
