-- one of the small sorrows of my adult life is being married to a man who wo n't eat tongue			1
" it 's delicious , " i tell him , but he wo n't budge			2
" if you tasted it and did n't know what it was , you 'd love it , " i say			2
" the problem is all in your head ! " " so ? " he says , perfectly content with his head and its problems			2
" i 'm still not eating it			2
" undeterred , i describe the excitement i felt as a kid when i 'd lift the lid on my mom 's big frying pan and spy a beef tongue cooking there			1
" it was curled -- you know , like that @entity28 logo , " i say , " only brownish gray , and covered in cream of mushroom soup , and , um. ... " i realize i 'm not making headway			2
tongue is a hard sell to someone who has already placed it firmly outside his own personal sphere of comfort			1
we all have versions of these spheres , into which we segregate the edible from the inedible			2
culture and ethnicity play a huge part in what winds up inside them ( we do not eat monkey ; the @entity49 of @entity50 do ) , as do our parents and friends , advertising , politics , religion , our anxieties , and life experiences			1
it 's no wonder each person in the @entity60 ( where we have so much choice about what to eat ) probably defines " edible " in a slightly different way			1
our individual menus are as unique as our fingerprints			2
@entity0 : one woman explores the virtues of eating everything take my friend @entity69			1
she is an adventuresome cook who is utterly incapable of eating an egg if the white and yellow are n't combined			2
she can eat omelets and scrambled eggs			1
but fried eggs ? deviled eggs ? hard - boiled eggs chopped up in potato salad ? " i ca n't even choke them down , " she says , her voice taking on a tinge of hysteria			2
" something about the texture -- you know how the yolks are kind of crumbly and the whites sort of rubbery and solid ? it just does n't work for me at all			2
" no one starts out life with an aversion to eggs or tongue -- or , for that matter , to liver , okra , lima beans , or any of the dozens of other foods many people come to revile as adults			1
indeed , according to @entity103 , @entity104 , professor of psychology at the @entity106 and an expert in disgust and food choice , there are only a handful of flavors our brains are hardwired to reject , and all are typical of foods that historically had a high likelihood of making us sick -- spoiled things like moldy bread and sour milk , and bitter things like caffeine			1
" a lot of natural plant toxins are bitter , " he says			2
in addition to this self - protective mechanism , there are two other universal , built - in predilections : first , a suspicion of ( yet interest in ) unfamiliar foods			1
and second , the ability to connect something new we ate to certain consequences , such as nausea			2
@entity0 : what happens when anxiety controls your diet that 's it			0
" everything else is acquired , " according to @entity141 , phd , provost of @entity143 and a longtime professor of the psychology of eating			1
" there 's no inborn dislike for any other taste or smell , even of vomit or feces			0
" in other words , you ca n't blame genes when you pick the anchovies off your pizza			0
so where do we acquire our vast range of idiosyncratic dislikes ? " their origin is obscure , " says @entity103			1
he admits that we generally grow to dislike foods that remind us of our bodily functions , guts , or mortality -- which might explain why liver ( and other mealy , pasty foods ) and oysters ( and other squishy , slimy foods ) put off so many people			1
@entity0 : what you need to know about the meat you buy it might even account for @entity69 's egg issue			0
she half - recalls overhearing as a child that eggs were chicken embryos , a thought that disturbed her in a way she still ca n't quite explain without turning green			1
says @entity141 , " sometimes an idea produces an emotional reaction , and the emotion produces a physiological reaction " -- namely , nausea			0
this is n't hardwired self - protective " disgust , " but it may have somehow piggybacked on the same apparatus			0
as @entity141 says , " the disgust mechanism is a very , very powerful thing			0
putting something in your body is an intimate act			0
" any revulsion you feel toward a food is magnified by the thought that it will become part of you			1
this apparatus occasionally goes haywire			0
in 2007 @entity205 chronicled the struggle of @entity207 , a strapping 28 - year - old father of two , to overcome a lifelong inability to eat anything but cheese , chips , and white bread			1
after four weeks of therapy and nutritional counseling , he managed to add salad to his diet ; hot food still made him gag			1
@entity0 : how to eat in your 20s , 30s , 40s , 50s and beyond you do n't have to be as compulsive as @entity207 to feel similar dread			1
history is full of stories of ordinary people who refused to eat unfamiliar food			1
the first colonists to @entity229 faced this predicament , myths of the first @entity232 to the contrary			0
they " had come upon a land of plenty , " according to eating in @entity229 , by @entity236 and @entity237			0
" they nearly starved in it			0
" why ? because among other things , they " could not or would not adapt themselves to the foods available locally ... and elected instead to depend on supplies from @entity243			1
" close to death , many awaited shipments of @entity243 beef rather than swallow a morsel of lobster or a clam			1
the few among them who trusted the natives eventually provided a bridge to these strange new forms of sustenance			0
it sounds perverse , until you consider what you would do if you washed up on the shores of @entity263 island and were offered a meal of sautéed silkworm pupae			0
you , too , might bide your time , hoping for a box of @entity268 to float in on the waves			0
@entity0 : the innovative spirit of vegan cooking yet , clearly , diets are n't set in stone			0
we constantly add new things -- goji berries , lemongrass , @entity278 -- and reject others -- chicken nuggets , say , after seeing @entity284 " you can think yourself into an aversion , " says @entity141			0
and most of the time , you can think yourself out of one			0
the @entity243 author of two @entity292 cookbooks and a memoir , @entity294 and @entity295 , she went to great pains to get past her revulsion to some of the foods she was fed in @entity300 -- including goose intestines , pig brain , scorpions , bee larvae , and tendons from cows ' throats , which she describes as " just like rubber bands			1
" because the @entity292 truly relish these foods , she wanted to learn to like them , too			1
it helped to realize that @entity292 cuisine , which has been evolving for thousands of years , celebrates variety in textures -- slimy , chewy , gelatinous , crunchy -- the way @entity317 cuisine champions complexity in flavor			0
" in @entity300 , the sensation of a thing in your mouth is part of the pleasure of eating it , " says @entity289			1
" in the @entity332 , if you get a bit of cartilage in your mouth , it 's the rubbish , but in @entity300 it 's the good part			1
it 's fun to try negotiating your way through a chicken wing with your teeth and tongue			2
" @entity0 : what 's the right diet for you ? take the quiz ! still , she admits that overcoming certain aversions required an iron will			1
take " thousand - year - old eggs , " made by submerging raw duck eggs for three months in a brew of ash , lime , tea , and salt			0
" the white turns into brownish jelly , and the yolk is a dark creamy thing edged in moldy green - gray			0
" at first @entity289 found them revolting , but now she eats them with abandon , having decided to " think of them as the egg equivalent of blue cheese			0
" i ca n't say how i 'd react if served a thousand - year - old - egg , but , like @entity289 , i see aversions as obstacles worth fighting to overcome			0
i 've been this way since i was a kid and vowed to taste an olive and an oyster every year until i grew to like them -- an outcome i had utter faith in			0
but i must confess that my tolerance for odd foods sometimes makes me intolerant of other people 's aversions to them , and that 's not fair			2
much as i 'd like to coerce my husband into eating delicious , slow - cooked beef tongue , i have to accept that only he can decide what to him is delicious , and what remains banished forever to the land of utter yuck			1
