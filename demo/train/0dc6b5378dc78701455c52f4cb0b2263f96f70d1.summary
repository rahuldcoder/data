in a " wake - up call , " climate change scientists contend rising seas endanger @entity4 's newest and oldest landmarks such as the @entity5 at @entity6 and the first @entity8 colony at @entity10 's @entity9 , portending a new century of disasters if @entity4 do n't act			1
listing 30 at - risk sites , the @entity13 notes how heritage sites such as @entity16 and @entity17 have already prepared themselves for " human - induced climate change			1
" but many historic treasures from @entity21 to @entity22 will be imperiled in the 21st century to bigger oceans and more wildfires and floods , the group asserted			2
critics of climate change research are n't as dire and say the warming that the @entity29 now feels could have happened naturally in the ancient past			1
critics contend that current studies advancing man - made influences on global warming are too short - sighted by covering only the past 1,500 to 2,000 years			2
the @entity13 , however , said all its case studies " draw on observations of impacts that are consistent with , or attributable to , human - induced climate change based on multiple lines of scientific evidence			1
" the group urged @entity4 to protect the landmarks and " to reduce the carbon emissions that are driving up the planet 's temperature , " the group 's report said			1
" the historic legacy of the @entity4 is at stake			0
" those landmarks include sites where the " first @entity4 lived , " @entity55 conquistadors ruled , slaves fled their masters , and a launch pad put the first man on the moon , the group said			1
" you can almost trace the history of the @entity4 through these sites , " @entity61 , the group 's director of climate impacts and a report co-author , said in a statement			1
" the imminent risks to these sites and the artifacts they contain threaten to pull apart the quilt that tells the story of the nation 's heritage and history			0
" for example , massive fires and floods have destroyed ancient pueblo masonry , pottery , petroglyphs , adobe buildings and trails at @entity87 in @entity88 or @entity89 in @entity90 , the report said			0
among landmarks likely to be submerged in rising seas by century 's end are @entity9 , where @entity8 colonialists made their first permanent settlement in the @entity96 , and portions of the @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity100			0
historic districts in @entity103 , @entity100 , @entity104 , @entity105 , and @entity106 , @entity21 , are also at risk to a swollen ocean and possible worsening storm surges , the group said			2
in @entity21 , prehistoric communities made of oyster and clam shells are also in peril , such as the @entity115 , a community dating to 1,000 @entity117 , the group said			2
the @entity118 holds landmark communities built on wetlands out of oyster shells			0
in one case , the @entity123 and the @entity124 have established a " living shoreline " of oyster mats , @entity132 grass and mangroves to protect the 1,200 - year - old @entity126 , made of shells , in @entity128 , the group said			0
but elsewhere in @entity21 , the @entity5 , site of the historic @entity135 launch , has seen recent restoration and protection efforts " undone " by storm surges			2
those protections had sought to shore up dunes near the launch pads , and @entity143 is now evaluating climate change and further protective measures , the group said			1
prehistoric relics are falling into the ocean in @entity148 , where melting ice caps and permafrost are allowing storms to erode the coastlines of @entity153 and the @entity154 , where " irreplaceable prehistoric artifacts " are falling out of the shorelines into the sea , said @entity61			0
on the west coast of @entity22 's @entity160 , coastal flooding connected to rising seas threaten ancient trails , seawalls , fish traps and sacred places , the report said			1
the @entity167 and its landmarks are also vulnerable to a one - two punch of big wildfires and then monsoon flooding , the report said			0
for example , @entity90 's second largest wildfire in its history -- which destroyed 156,000 acres in 2011 -- damaged more than more than 16,000 forested acres belonging to the @entity175 , a federally registered @entity176 and @entity177			0
disaster struck it again when heavy rains flooded local canyons , barren from the fire			0
the @entity175 is home to ancient rock carvings and cliff dwellings			0
" cutting carbon emissions significantly and quickly can slow the pace of sea level rise , limit the temperature increases , and slow the expansion of the wildfire season , " @entity185 , director of the group 's climate and energy program , said in a statement .			1

some landmarks now see damage such as the @entity21 launch pad for the first man on moon
science group contends ' human - induced climate change ' threatens heritage sites
imperiled are ancient mesas , @entity209 sacred places , @entity148 coast , and @entity21 sites
group urges @entity4 to act to reduce carbon emissions
