-- a former drug dealer was executed in @entity2 on wednesday night for the murders of two reputed gang members -- 15 years to the day after the crime			1
@entity2 death row inmate @entity6 says he acted in self - defense when he shot and killed two in 1994			1
@entity6 , 49 , was pronounced dead at 7:21 p.m. et , a spokeswoman for the @entity10 said			1
" self - defense is not capital murder , " @entity6 said before the lethal injection began , echoing his unsuccessful claims to the courts to prevent his execution			1
@entity6 did not deny firing the fatal shots outside a @entity19 bar but insisted he acted in self - defense and did not deserve to die			1
@entity6 was the second death row inmate to be executed in 2009			2
he spoke at length with @entity23 in 2007			0
@entity24 and @entity25 were shot multiple times in the head and chest early in the morning of january 21 , 1994 , outside the @entity30 bar			1
" they came with intentions to kill me , " @entity6 said in the interview			2
" it was a do - or - die situation			0
" but no witnesses ever came forward at trial to corroborate @entity6 's self - defense claims			1
prosecutors contended that @entity6 , a long - time gang member with a lengthy rap sheet dating back to his teens , shot the two in cold blood to assert his authority after a shoving match broke out in the bar , according to court records			1
a @entity48 jury convicted @entity6 and sentenced him to death , but his conviction was reversed in 1998 after the @entity51 found error in the trial court 's refusal to give the jury the option of convicting @entity6 of a lesser offense			2
even so , @entity6 was convicted and sentenced to death at his second trial in 1999			2
@entity6 insisted he acted in self - defense when he opened fire on @entity24 , 23 , and @entity25 , 15 , at a bar near the housing projects where @entity6 admitted he sold crack cocaine and weapons			1
but it was not until 2006 that a private investigator , who once worked against @entity6 and his fellow gangsters , came forward with information that @entity6 said corroborated his self - defense claims			1
@entity71 , a retired @entity72 who was in charge of the private security firm that oversaw the projects , was the first peace officer on the scene , arriving about 45 minutes before the @entity78 , according to an affidavit			0
during that time , @entity71 said he spoke with witnesses who reported that @entity24 and @entity25 shot at @entity6 first from inside the car after trying to run him over , according to the affidavit			1
witnesses also told @entity71 that they had seen the victims ' relatives remove their weapons from the car before police arrived , @entity71 stated in the affidavit			0
when @entity71 attempted to share the information with @entity19 @entity89 , he says the officers told him to forget everything he had seen and learned , he said in an affidavit			0
" i was told that did not matter , as they already had @entity6 , the murder weapon and an eyewitness , " @entity71 stated in his affidavit			2
" i was told @entity6 was a dope dealer and had to go to jail			0
" since then , three others have come forward claiming they witnessed the shootings , providing similar details , said @entity6 's lawyer , @entity103			0
" unfortunately , people from the street did n't come forward to testify at the time of the trial , " he said			0
" the problem is , the law does n't allow for a change of circumstances			0
" the @entity112 argued that @entity6 's claims should be dismissed because the evidence had always been available , and was not the " newly discovered " evidence the law requires			0
a lower court sided with the state , prompting @entity6 to appeal to the 5th @entity119			0
on monday , the court declined to hear his claims , making the @entity124 @entity123 's last chance for a reprieve			2
the justices remained silent on the matter .			0
