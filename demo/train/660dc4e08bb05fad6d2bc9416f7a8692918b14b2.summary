the neighborhoods look like those in many @entity4 cities			1
there 's a mix of new and old			0
cars and buses shuttle from here to there			0
and people crowd the streets , the only thing distinct about them being that they look more diverse than some other places			0
these are places to go , locals say -- not " no - go zones , " as described by a @entity20 commentator as well as @entity22 gov. @entity21			1
the last few weeks have seen characterizations of some @entity4 cities as inordinately full of @entity25 , areas where a woman without a veil might feel too scared to explore , areas that police largely avoid , and where @entity32 law rules the day			1
this storyline has struck a nerve in place like the @entity37 city of @entity38 and the @entity40 neighborhood of @entity41 , coming on the heels of terror attacks in @entity44 that killed 17 and stirred worries around @entity4			1
it 's left some angry , dismissive or incredulous , unsure of what to make of it all			0
who are these people , they ask , making sweeping , damning assessments of their hometowns from thousands of miles away ? " when i heard this , frankly i choked on my porridge , and i thought it was @entity56 , " @entity37 prime minister @entity57 told network @entity58 , referring specifically to @entity20 commentator @entity60 's remarks			1
" this guy is clearly a complete idiot			0
" the central @entity64 city of @entity38 has a long and proud history , from @entity67 - era natives to @entity69 conquerors to medieval markets and more			1
today , the city is home to more than 1 million people -- who , partly due to its universities , are younger than @entity64 's overall population with 45.7 % under age 30			1
@entity38 is also relatively diverse , with about 42 % of its citizens being not white and 22 % born outside the country			1
in terms of religion , just over 46 % of residents are @entity84 , just under 22 % are @entity25 , and about 19 % have no religion			1
it is not as @entity60 described it earlier this month : " there are actually cities like @entity38 that are totally @entity25 , where non-muslims simply do n't go in			1
" this assertion is wrong , as @entity60 and @entity20 later admitted			1
but that does n't mean it did n't sting			0
@entity37 's @entity94 talked to several people in @entity38 , some of whom called such claims ridiculous , others who dismissed them as misconceptions , and one called it simply ignorant			1
" we are not in cuckoo land , " @entity102 , co-owner of the @entity104 market founded by @entity106 immigrants , told the @entity107			0
" there are lots of @entity25 here , but this is a multicultural society and there are beautiful links between the different religions			1
how can they say this ? @entity38 is one of the stable communities			1
" some poked fun at the remarks on @entity123 , with one claiming " the @entity37 army ... sent snow to make @entity38 white again " and another showing a picture of a bingo hall called " @entity128			1
" joked one man : " was a bit surprised that i had to convert to the @entity25 faith before they 'd let me off the train at @entity38 the other day			1
" @entity38 was n't the only @entity37 city caught up in the controversy			1
so , too , was the capital , @entity138			0
@entity60 , for one , talked about " no - go zones " around @entity64			1
and during a speech in @entity138 , @entity21 said that " in the @entity141 , non-assimilationist @entity25 establish enclaves and carry out as much of @entity32 law as they can without regard for the laws of the democratic countries which provided them a new home			1
" " it is startling to think that any country would allow , even unofficially , for a so - called ' no - go zone , ' " he said			0
" the idea that a free country would allow for specific areas of its country to operate in an autonomous way that is not free and is in direct opposition to its laws is hard to fathom			2
" @entity21 later doubled - down on the comments , telling @entity1 's @entity160 that " there are people here in @entity138 that will tell you there are neighborhoods where women do n't feel safe ... without veils " and " where police are less likely to go			0
" a @entity1 crew went out to @entity172 , the @entity138 borough with the largest @entity25 population , and found people who thought the @entity177 governor 's remarks were not based in reality			1
they said they felt safe and comfortable in a community that looked like many other parts of the city			0
@entity184 , who represents @entity138 's police union , was similarly disbelieving			0
" this is not something we recognize at all , " @entity184 said			0
" we do n't have areas in @entity138 that are no - go			0
we do n't have areas in @entity138 that are @entity32 law only			1
and we police all areas of @entity138			0
" this debate unfolded hundreds of miles from the place that got the world talking about it in the first place : @entity41			2
that 's where two @entity200 extremists stormed the offices of @entity204 magazine january 7 , leaving 12 dead			0
a policewoman in the @entity41 suburb of @entity207 was killed a day later			2
the next day , the national nightmare climaxed in a pair of raids that killed three terrorists , on top of the four civilians dead after a hostage siege at a kosher market in eastern @entity41			2
these events and their ties to an extreme , twisted and violent form of @entity219 made what 's happening in @entity44 a talking point for commentators worldwide			2
some of that media buzz drew the ire of @entity44 nationals , in particular @entity20 for @entity60 's comments and segments suggesting there are parts of @entity41 and other @entity4 cities where @entity219 law is practiced and where police are fearful to work			1
@entity41 mayor @entity233 went so far as to lay out plans to sue @entity20 for having " insulted " her city			1
" the image of @entity41 has been prejudiced , " she told @entity1 's @entity237			2
" and the honor of @entity41 has been prejudiced			2
" not everyone in @entity44 is rallying around @entity204 , especially after it published a cartoon depicting the @entity242 after the attacks			2
teacher @entity244 told @entity1 that many of his @entity25 students felt the magazine 's staff had some responsibility for what happened , saying , " they continued doing what they were doing in full knowledge of the risks			2
" yet even if the entire country is n't on the same page when it comes to the satirical magazine , that does n't mean some places are isolated -- at least when it comes to police patrolling the streets or whether anyone , including women without veils , feel welcome on them			0
@entity1 's @entity267 grew up in the @entity41 neighborhood of @entity40 , which has a large number of @entity25 and immigrants			1
she describes it as a lively place where rent is a little cheaper , items at the market cost a little less , and people feel welcome , wherever they come from			0
people who are there now echo that view , saying they feel safe , comfortable and happy to live somewhere that people of all ethnicities and religions call home			0
it 's no wonder then , that some proud @entity44 nationals felt disgusted by the idea of outsiders casting aspersions on such neighborhoods as dangerous places			2
others fought back with humor -- as evidenced in a fake @entity44 news show , " @entity293 , " in which two men pretending to be @entity20 reporters are seen on the streets of @entity41			1
a graphic on the screen reads , " @entity299			0
" at one point , one of the actors talks about getting in a taxi with a driver who had " a @entity25 beard			2
oh my @entity306 , he 's a very dangerous @entity200			0
he wants to kill us			0
" a little later on , one commentates as his fellow correspondent goes in and out of a @entity311 restaurant			0
" @entity313 , it 's too dangerous			0
come back , come back ; run away , run away , " the actor screams in seeming desperation			0
" @entity306 , couscous ! couscous is very dangerous			0
couscous in @entity41 ! " @entity1 's @entity319 and @entity160 in @entity138 , as well as @entity1 's @entity320 in @entity41 , contributed to this report .			2

some in @entity324 media have said certain @entity25 areas in @entity4 are *unwelcoming* , under @entity32 law
residents of @entity38 , @entity64 , dismiss such claims , saying they *'re* not based in reality
@entity41 ' mayor has sued @entity20 over such assertions , while others in @entity44 responded with satire
