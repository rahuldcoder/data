have you been pining for your very own wearable $ 1,500 @entity1 but were n't sure how you , a regular nondeveloper residing in the @entity3 , could procure one ? tuesday will be your lucky day			1
@entity5 is opening sales of @entity1 for one day only to any adult in the @entity3 who wants one of the devices			1
in true sale fashion , @entity5 is throwing in free frames or sunglasses for those first - time customers and the supply is limited			1
sales start at 9 a.m. et on april 15 , but people can sign up now with @entity5 to receive a reminder			1
this is the first time the device has been available to the general public			2
so far , the face - mounted computers have been sold only to @entity23 , " the company 's name for early adopters			1
at first only developers could buy @entity1 , but @entity5 slowly expanded the program to include regular people			1
some were hand - picked , others applied to be explorers through @entity5 contests by sharing what cool projects they would do if they had @entity1			2
in the year since @entity1 was first shipped , it has been lauded as the future of computing , criticized for hastening the death of privacy , and mocked for looking silly			2
people wearing @entity1 have been banned from bars and restaurants , given tickets for distracted driving , and dubbed " @entity45			0
" it 's been a busy year			0
glass mounts on a pair of compatible glasses and positions a small display above the wearer 's right eye			0
the wearer uses @entity1 to access the @entity54 and can simply look up to see things like directions , notifications and content from custom glass apps on the screen			2
it is controlled by voice or using the tiny touch pad on the side			0
the device 's most controversial feature is a small camera that can record 720p video or snap still photos			0
there 's no indicator light showing when the camera is on , though @entity1 wearers say the display lights up , so it 's not a secret			0
@entity5 and @entity23 say that more education and exposure is needed to dispel privacy fears and for the technology to be embraced by the general public			1
this one - day sale could lead to a lot more people donning the devices			0
we 'll have to see if that helps or hurts the @entity1 cause .			0
