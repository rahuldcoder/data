-- " cruising " -- the word conjures up images of overflowing buffets , arm - wrestling at the soft serve machine and death by deck quoits			1
but there 's another side to this kind of travel that spits in the eye of the stereotypical deckchair - hogging cocktail sipper -- and that 's adventure and expedition cruising			1
it 's almost deceptive to call it " cruising			1
" it 's truly " adventure by ship " where the often exotic destination is as much part of the attraction as the way you get there			1
these floating adventures take the form of anything from five - star champagne explorations to ambling along in a tramp steamer			1
@entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 extreme rating : 6/10 no , not the land of nodding @entity38 dolls and plastic grass skirts			1
over at @entity41 , adventurous vacationers can get aboard the @entity42 with just 36 others and , in between kayaking , hiking among volcanoes and dolphin spotting , engage in a mesmerizing ballet with manta rays			2
the cruise visits islands such as @entity50 , a kind of frangipani fortress housing the true @entity54 " aloha " spirit , and @entity56 , where you can hunt and shoot and go horseriding			1
@entity60 , +1 888 862 8881 , from $ 700 per person per night			2

across the @entity64 , @entity65 extreme rating : 6/10 until only a few years ago , the fabled @entity64 was just a theoretical shipping route between the @entity69 and @entity68 across the top of @entity71			1
for centuries , people died trying to get through and some of them are still there , buried in permafrost graves			2
now , with changing climates , the passage can be completed with more confidence and your bragging rights enhanced without fear of death			2
while you 're there , you can visit the @entity85 communities who 've lived on the ice for centuries			2
@entity89 , from $ 600 per person per night			2
through ancient @entity91 , @entity92 extreme rating : 7/10 the 16th - century @entity95 explorers would n't have a bar of it			1
@entity92 's northwest is so inhospitable , it 's even a challenge for the local @entity102 and @entity103 people who 've lived there for thousands of years			1
but this remote and harshly beautiful part of @entity92 is the country 's adventure cruise hotspot			1
its season is from april through to september , when the torrential rains have eased and water cascades off the plateau			0
infested with crocodiles and spotted with possibly the world 's oldest rock art , the @entity91 is in danger due to unchecked oil and gas exploration -- you should go before it 's spoiled			0
@entity119 , from $ 1,000 per person per night			0
more : 8 of the world 's cutest , coziest , wintriest scenes 7			0
@entity123 , the @entity124 extreme rating : 7/10 sure , it 's the world 's largest river by volume but it 's also a major sea lane			1
you reach the departure point for the @entity124 's best cruising by flying to the city of @entity134 , @entity135 , and then making for the @entity123 where the evocatively named @entity138 ( blackwater ) and @entity140 ( canoe breaker ) rivers feed into the main body			1
wildlife in the reserve include piranha , sloths , rare pink dolphins and lots of noisy monkeys			1
you can commune with the indigenous @entity150 families who live along the banks before retiring to a luxury 24 - passenger vessel to fry your piranha			1
@entity154 , from $ 700 per person per night			1
' @entity157 ' tour , @entity158 extreme rating : 7/10 the @entity160 begins in the glaciers of @entity162 before winding through @entity158 and emptying , 2,900 kilometers later , into the @entity163			1
while the cruise aboard the delightfully anachronistic 24 - person @entity166 trundles along from @entity167 to @entity168 , you can sip local tea and enjoy mild @entity171 curries onboard			1
a visit to the @entity174 - listed @entity173 , for elephant , rhino and ( maybe ) tiger spotting , is one of the diversions en route			0
@entity181 , from $ 400 per person per night			0
more : @entity184 's 12 best shopping cities 5			0
into wild @entity185 extreme rating : 8/10 the once war - torn republics that form a patchwork across @entity185 are opening up to seaborne tourists			1
countries such as @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 are starting to recover from their devastating conflicts , allowing visitors to explore the former slave ports , wildlife sanctuaries and voodoo markets			0
ramshackle villages along the coastal cruise route provide plenty of opportunities for eating , drinking , singing and dancing			1
now may be the time to go : increasing piracy in the @entity209 is making marine insurers nervous			0
@entity211 , from $ 600 per person per night			0
following @entity213 , @entity214 extreme rating : @entity216 when your neighbors come home from their heroic @entity214 cruise , chances are they 've been on a doddle across to the continent 's @entity223			1
you can trump them by following in the wake of real explorers such as @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230			0
sail to the @entity232 or @entity233 , where these blokes walked out into the white , and you 'll find the huts they left behind , still crammed in some cases with frozen 100 - year - old kit			0
landing at @entity240 can be tricky , though			0
if massive icebergs the size of small republics do n't block your passage , the famed katabatic winds that blow up to 200mph threaten to push you back to @entity247			2
@entity248 , from $ 600 per person per night			0

@entity41 hopping in the @entity68 extreme rating : @entity216 the ship looks like a prop from " @entity254 , " but the little 12 - person @entity256 sets sail from @entity257 for some of the most remote , uninhabited islands in the @entity68			1
pelagic specks with names such as @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 and @entity266 are the objective for no other apparent reason than they exist			0
finishing up in @entity272 after 29 days , your objective is to have landed on 10 of these remote islands -- the company even offers a pro-rata refund if you do n't			2
@entity277 , from $ 1,200 per person per night			0
ice - breaking to the @entity279 extreme rating : @entity281 it does n't get much more extreme than this ( although see below )			1
just 100 years ago voyagers to the @entity279 received equivalent celebrity to the moon explorers @entity287 and team in the 1960s			0
you could still choose to haul your sled over the treacherous crevasses , hummocks and sastrugi ( ice obstacles ) or instead get aboard the world 's most powerful icebreaker , the @entity292 nuclear 50 лет @entity293 ( 50 years of @entity290 )			0
there 's not a lot to see en route as @entity305 turbines push 25,000 tons of steel through the icepack up to three meters thick on the way to 90 deg n. leaving @entity309 , in @entity292 , you 're back within two weeks			0
@entity310 , from $ 2,000 per person per night			0
down to the @entity313 wreck , @entity69 extreme rating : 10/10 if crazy @entity317 's vision comes to life , you 'll be able to sail on a replica titanic in 2016			2
but for a glimpse of life ( and death ) aboard the original 1912 vessel , you can get aboard a specialized submersible for an eight - hour joy ride down to the ship , 12,500 feet below the surface of the @entity69			2
trips are intermittent depending on demand and various legal wrangles , but if the @entity313 is off the menu , tours are also available to @entity333 ( 15,000 feet ) or the @entity334 at a trifling 10,000 feet			0
deep sea adventures are starting to compete with space travel as an extreme trip , with the likes of sir @entity339 considering ventures in this space too			2
adventure associates , from $ 5,000 per person per night ( dive time approx eight hours ) more : thrill seeker 's bucket list : 50 experiences to try before you die for the best part of the last two decades , @entity348 has been scouring the farthest , coldest , windiest , driest , wettest and least visited parts of the planet while reporting for newspapers and magazines			1
strange for a chap who 's not so keen on discomfort			0
when not shivering , sweating or drying himself off , he is the editor of the @entity358 .			0
