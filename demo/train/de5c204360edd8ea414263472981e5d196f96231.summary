@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's been almost three years since @entity4 cut a merciless path of destruction across the @entity8 @entity7 , killing more than 1,800 people and displacing tens of thousands more			1
@entity10 on site in @entity0 , @entity1 -- one of many rebuilding projects that @entity14 is overseeing			1
the coastal resort of @entity0 was among the hardest hit ; hurricane - force winds leveled homes , stripped branches from trees and created a trail of devastation that rendered the popular @entity22 virtually uninhabitable			1
three years on , homes are still being rebuilt to house people who were forced to seek shelter wherever they could			1
for some , that 's meant spending years living in cramped conditions in caravans until they could afford to rebuild			1
@entity10 , co-founder of @entity14 , is leading a project to rehouse residents of @entity0 affected by the storm			1
on july 9 , he 'll be taking part in a @entity36 debate on @entity37 : how can clever design conserve precious resources and lead to a greener way of life ? @entity2 caught up with @entity10 in @entity0 and started by asking him what the difference is between design and design for good ? @entity10 : design is about creating spaces for people to enjoy and of course , creating moments where you elevate the spirit , but design for good is figuring out a program that not only creates better spaces , but creates jobs , creates new industry and really kind of raises the conversation about how we rebuild			1
@entity2 : how many countries are you working in and what are you doing ? @entity62 : we are currently in about 26 countries and we have around about 4000 volunteer architects and designers globally			1
we are working on a whole range of projects whether it be bringing health services into remote @entity71 or working on a chocolate factory in the @entity73 which is actually a conservation project , or doing low income housing in @entity75 , @entity76 , so we 're pretty global in our reach			1
@entity2 : you have worked all over the world , @entity80 , @entity76 , and @entity81			1
when you think of people 's living conditions , are you surprised that @entity8 do n't realize how tough people have it in their own country ? have you seen things in the @entity8 , for example , that are worse than in so - called developing countries ? @entity62 : yeah , i mean people find it kind of shocking when i talk about this			1
you know , there are places in rural @entity8 , especially in places like the reservations , we 've done a lot of work with @entity103 and @entity104 and we 're about to start work with the @entity106 where i look at the housing stock and it is far worse then i 've seen in somewhere like @entity76 or you know , in @entity109			1
you know , @entity8 are unbelievably open , welcoming and helpful , they donate to everybody			1
but quite often we do n't look at the reality of our own lives			2
the fact that we have a crumbling school system , that our healthcare in this country is just diabolical , the support for nurses and teachers is just out of control and i look at all these facilities that are happening in the @entity8 and i begin to question			2
this is supposed to be the most powerful place in the world but we ca n't build a decent school for our kids so you know there is a reality check that needs to happen			2
@entity2 : when you look at the big picture of the problems the world is facing , what solutions can you see that cities and their designs can offer when it comes to global issues such as global warming ? @entity62 : what worries me the most is you have all these global issues that are out there , whether its lack of education or lack of healthcare or climate change , and people think they are separate compartmentalized issues , but they 're all interweaved so that when we 're working on structures , we 're thinking about how can we make the building energy efficient			2
how can we make the design open , allowing access to everybody so that you 're hitting on all these things			2
we 're working in neighborhoods where sustainability is a matter of life or death for people so climate change is an issue for us , but we may not be putting solar panels on the side of the building we just may be looking at creating a way of getting clean water into the village and that mechanism is important			2
@entity2 : how vital is sustainability ? @entity62 : it 's very vital			2
i mean , we 've never pushed ourselves as a green organization			0
we 've never done that kind of branding , you know , of great green buildings but all our architects and all our designers in the field realize that they have to have an element of sustainability because communities ca n't maintain things they ca n't afford and if its not sustainable both materialistic and also financially then the building will be underutilized so it 's a waste of everybody 's time			0
if you build something that is out of the reach of the community , then they ca n't own it			0
there 's no empowerment in taking over that structure			1
@entity2 : how do you see your role in all of this ? @entity62 : the main thing is , i 'm not the architect on this			0
we have architecture firms in a 100 countries right now , who are working on projects and as a way , we 're working as a bridge , so architecture humanity bridges that kind of leg between the community , the design and the funding , so we have to bring in all the funding			1
we have to make sure that we have the legal and financial constraints in place and understood that the designers are committed to the process so in a way we 're acting as that mediator between all those different stake holders			0
@entity2 : i 'm curious how on a personal level it has impacted your life , i mean you came out of college or university and basically went straight into this			0
it is your life in a way			0
@entity62 : yeah , no. i mean , this really has become my life and a lot of other people that work with me , it 's their life but we have n't become financially rich but we 've become rich in many other ways			0
just in the last month some of the communities that we have sat down and had dinner with and talked about their lives and the things their hopeful about is incredibly inspiring			0
it 's what keeps us going			0
@entity2 : so it 's not a job , is it ? @entity62 : no , i do n't think anyone could live if they just had a job			0
a career is a job you love , right ? that 's what a career should be			0
if you 're in a job that you hate , you should quit			0
that 's the way i look at it			0
i 'm in a job that i love so i 'm going to make it my career			0
