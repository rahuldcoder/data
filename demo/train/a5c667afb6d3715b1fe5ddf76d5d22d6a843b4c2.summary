what 's longer than five @entity2 jetliners , 2.5 times taller than the @entity3 of @entity4 and uses robot bartenders to pour your drinks ? that 'll be @entity10 's new @entity9 , which the cruise brand bills as the world 's most technologically advanced cruise ship			1
the highly hyped ship is now in the middle of its inaugural voyage , an eight - day cruise from the @entity19 port of @entity20 to @entity21			2
the cruise line says @entity9 , which weighs 167,800 gross registered tons , has 16 guest decks filled with 2,090 of the brand 's largest and most advanced staterooms , which can occupy 4,180 guests			1
could n't score a room with an ocean view ? no problem			0
passengers in interior staterooms get virtual balconies that offer real - time views of the ocean and destinations on large screens			1
in terms of connectivity , @entity10 has partnered with service provider @entity41 and claims to offer " more bandwidth than every other cruise ship in the world combined			1
" other high - tech features include the use of electronic wristbands that serve as room keys and allow passengers to navigate the ship and make onboard purchases			1
but what seems to be getting all the attention are on board attractions such as the @entity56 skydiving simulator , those aforementioned robot bartenders in the " @entity58 " , @entity59 -- a sky pod that allows guests to rise 300 feet above the ship in a retractable crane -- bumper cars and interactive art created by digital and video artists			1
instead of having one main dining room and a few alternatives there are 18 restaurants , five of which are complimentary venues			0
tipsy robot bartenders ? despite claiming to be the most high tech ship in the world , the @entity9 launch was n't hitch free			2
" its ' super-fast ' internet that is said to allow passengers to stream video , @entity84 and download emails simultaneously at speeds they would on shore , did not work as smoothly as it should have , " says a report on the @entity19 's @entity77 about the ship 's brief @entity20 visit			0
" @entity10 was also not having much luck with the two robots at the @entity58 , " says the report			0
" the robotic arms failed to stand glasses upright on a number of occasions			0
cocktails are meant to be mixed in one minute but as waiting times rose to 20 minutes the it team pulled the plug -- literally -- and went back to the drawing board			0
" however , the report suggested these issues will likely be resolved by the time the cruise docks in @entity21 on november 10 , blaming the patchy @entity103 on the fact service provider @entity41 does not yet have a satellite covering the @entity19			0
once the trans - @entity108 cruise is complete , @entity106 will spend the winter cruising the eastern @entity111 , with trips departing from @entity113			1
from next june , the mega-ship will operate year - round out of @entity115			2
sister - ship @entity9 will debut in @entity20 in april 2015 and sail @entity117 itineraries			2
construction on the third @entity106 class ship , @entity120 , started in september and is due to be delivered in the fall of 2016 , says the company			0
according to @entity124 , the @entity9 of ships represents a significant reduction in size compared with @entity10 's @entity128 ships , which measure 225,282 tons and carry 5,400 passengers at double occupancy .			1

@entity10 says @entity9 is the world 's most technologically advanced cruise ship

passengers in interior staterooms get virtual balconies , which offer real - time views of the ocean
