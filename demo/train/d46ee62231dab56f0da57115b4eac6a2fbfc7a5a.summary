-- the @entity3 @entity2 's decision upholding a piece of @entity6 's controversial immigration law portends such a " huge " increase in policing for one department that the chief wondered tuesday if his agency will be able to handle the workload			1
at a time when the @entity16 is down 160 officers because of a weakened economy , the agency now must make up to 50,000 additional phone calls a year to federal officials to verify the immigration status of persons whom officers have stopped and have reason to believe are in the country illegally , police chief @entity13 said tuesday			1
other law agencies in @entity6 , however , reported " business as usual " a day after the @entity2 ruling			1
just 70 miles from the @entity32 border , the @entity30 department may have to spend more than $ 10 million a year to book and jail up to 36,000 arrestees also suspected of being illegal immigrants -- a more than 7 % increase to the agency 's $ 130 million budget , @entity13 said			1
the police chief said he wonders if his 950 - officer agency has been dealt an " impossible mandate			1
" the state law , @entity43 , allows citizens to sue his department or others if they fail to enforce federal immigration laws , the chief said			1
@entity48 , @entity50 struggle with immigration issue " just for my agency , it will be a huge workload , just making the calls and waiting for a response on what to do , " the police chief of @entity6 's second - largest city said			1
" i 'm not sure the federal government is capable of handling all the requests that they will be receiving , " @entity13 added			0
" i do n't know what effect it will have on my agency			0
" tuesday marked the first 24 hours that state and local law agencies began enforcing the state immigration law since monday 's court ruling , and law agencies were either engaged in training or rolling out the mandatory immigration checks , said @entity71 , a spokeswoman for @entity6 attorney general 's office			1
" i 'm pretty sure it will be business as usual to some degree , " @entity71 said			1
analysis : five things learned from high court ruling that was the case for the more than 3,100 police officers in @entity80 , the state 's largest city , located 180 miles from the border			1
a police department spokesman said tuesday he had no immediate feedback from officers or @entity87 on the progress or results of the day 's immigration checks			1
" we 're really not attempting a big shift from what we 're doing now , " said spokesman sgt. @entity91			0
" i think there 's a misconception that police officers in @entity6 are going to go out and hunt down people who are illegally in the @entity3			1
" i am mandated to make a reasonable attempt to contact @entity87 , " @entity91 said			0
" it 's 107 in @entity80 today			1
how long am i going to stand on the side of the road with someone ( awaiting an @entity87 response ) ? it 's a matter of minutes -- 20 minutes maybe , 30 minutes maybe			0
" groups say immigration fight is changing @entity6 concerns by lawmen such as @entity13 unfolded as president @entity111 and @entity6 gov. @entity112 squared off about the impact of monday 's @entity2 ruling that upheld the " show - me - your - papers " provision -- but struck down other portions of the state law intended to deter illegal immigration			1
already , the @entity111 administration has indicated it wo n't allow @entity6 's immigration priorities to become federal priorities			2
the administration has ended the so - called 287 ( g ) agreements with @entity6 , under which state and local law agencies entered into a partnership with the @entity127 and were delegated authority for immigration enforcement within their jurisdictions			1
also , the administration recently halted deportations of @entity134 - eligible immigrants -- young adult undocumented immigrants -- as it will redirect resources to deporting those who are deemed a greater threat , such as criminals			0
the @entity139 highlighted its tougher approach on criminals in announcing a record number of deportations last year			0
in denouncing some of those @entity111 measures , @entity6 's @entity112 said further lawsuits lay ahead on the immigration status checks , and pledged , " this certainly is not the end of our journey			1
" the portion of the state law validated by the high court is potent , one expert said			2
" if you read the statute carefully , it literally creates an obligation for all law enforcement agencies to determine status of individuals , " said @entity154 , a vice dean and law professor at the @entity156			2
" by making it a mandate and lining it up against the warnings of the @entity2 , it 's created an impossibly difficult question for police and sheriffs			2
are we concerned about racial profiling ? absolutely			1
" but how police will apply the law -- requiring immigration checks while enforcing other laws if " reasonable suspicion " of illegal immigration exists -- is " confusing , " @entity0 senior legal analyst @entity174 said			1
" what does it look like in the real world to have reasonable suspicion that someone is here illegally ? what is a police officer supposed to do ? " @entity174 asked			2
" how to apply that in the real world is kind of mysterious to me			0
" at least two sheriffs in @entity6 said that the law wo n't result in great change for their departments			2
a changing national mood on immigration ? @entity196 @entity195 said his deputies will continue to call the @entity198 to determine a person 's immigration status if a deputy suspects that person is in the country illegally			2
that will result in about 100 referrals a month to the @entity198 , he said			0
" we 're continuing to do business as usual , " said @entity195 , who 's been sheriff for 32 years			2
@entity195 said he opposed @entity43 because if the entire law had been upheld by the federal courts , it would have resulted in overcrowded jails and overburdened state courts			2
" the more important thing is how the chief of a law enforcement agency chooses to enforce the law , " @entity195 said			2
for example , other counties do immigration sweeps , but not his , he said			0
" law enforcement did not ask for this law , " @entity195 said			0
" law enforcement did not need this law			0
" @entity224 county sheriff @entity223 said the validated portion of the law marked " very little change " for his department			0
his county shares a 50 - mile border with @entity32 and is a major corridor for smuggling of drugs and illegal migrants			0
his 39 officers will continue to call any of the 1,000 @entity3 @entity198 agents in his county to conduct immigration checks , he said			1
" our concern is the public perception of what we are doing , " he said			0
he fears @entity241 wo n't ask for help and witnesses wo n't come forward , he said			0
" the @entity244 will look at us a little differently , and that concerns me , " @entity223 said			0
merchants and residents of the @entity244 community reported anxiety and fear among clientele and neighbors			0
@entity80 taqueria owner @entity253 said tuesday that business has been dropping since the law was proposed in 2010 ; he predicted it will get worse now that the @entity2 has ruled			1
" it 's bad for the @entity261 community , " said @entity253 , a native of @entity32 who has been in @entity80 since 1990 and has run the @entity258 since 2003			2
" it seemed like everybody kind of forgot about it for a little bit and now , all of a sudden , i 've got friends who were talking to me yesterday , and they 're pretty scared because they 've got kids , they 've got family to support			0
" @entity271 , 31 , of @entity30 , a real estate broker and business owner , said many @entity244 immigrants do n't know the details of the law , but they do know something has changed			1
" they ca n't really look into it , so what they 'll do is they 'll hide , " she said			0
" there 's going to be less conversation , less help from individuals that maybe are n't doing anything wrong but know of somebody that is			0
" @entity290 , the former @entity50 state senator who authored @entity43 and then was ousted from office in a recall election in his suburban @entity80 district last year , told @entity0 tuesday that accusations of possible racial profiling were " demeaning to law enforcement			1
" " an officer is trained to pay attention to things that do n't fit			0
all this bill does is allow them to ask the questions they need to ask , " @entity290 said			0
opinion : how @entity6 law hurts @entity261 citizens @entity0 's @entity307 , @entity308 and @entity309 contributed to this report .			2
