-- as the @entity2 commemorates a decade since one of the most tragic days in its history , there will be plenty of television programming to mark the occasion			1
beyond the news coverage of the 10th anniversary of the september 11 attacks , there are more than 40 specials , documentaries and other shows planned			1
the programs seemingly cover every aspect , from @entity18 's " saved , " about how the bonds with their pets helped two @entity22 families cope with 9/11 , to @entity24 's documentary " the love we make , " about the benefit concert he organized after the tragedy			1
the latter was only recently completed and will air on @entity29			2
and @entity24 wo n't be the only famous face weighing in			2
" @entity45 " will offer reflections from celebrities , and @entity33 will offer " when @entity44 saved @entity2 , " a two - hour documentary examining how " comedians , singers , actors , entertainers all did their part with concerts , telethons and specials to help bring the nation back to the new normal			2
" @entity46 , a curator with @entity47 in @entity22 , said the amount of programming is to be expected , given the magnitude of the attacks on the @entity52 in @entity22 and the @entity53 in @entity54 " it 's such a major event and story in our history that it 's very hard to ignore it and seem relevant , " he said			0
" and yet there are lots of things that are difficult about it			0
one of the things , as crass as it sounds , is how do you do something that is distinctive from everyone else			0
" in the week leading up to the anniversary , @entity0 will feature four hourlong documentaries : " footnotes of 9/11 , " in which investigative correspondent @entity72 chronicles eight people mentioned in " the @entity74 " ; " dr. @entity76 reports : terror in the @entity78 , " which will examine the health effects of the attacks on responders ; the @entity83 - helmed " @entity82 : the @entity84 " ; and a special @entity0 / @entity87 / @entity86 presentation : " beyond 9/11 : portraits of @entity89			1
" at @entity90 , " today " will have coverage in the days leading up to september 11 , and the network will air a " @entity95 " special on september 5 and " @entity93 " on the anniversary			1
@entity96 will offer " @entity97 -- decade of @entity98 , " about how the country has changed , and @entity100 will have a two - hour special on the rebuilding of ground zero titled " @entity103 : freedom rising with @entity105			0
" the @entity106 will feature the @entity108 - produced documentary " rising : rebuilding @entity109 , " and the @entity111 network @entity110 will broadcast a five - hour show from that location			0
even children 's network @entity114 will feature " @entity115 with @entity116 : what happened ? the story of september 11 , 2001 " to explain the events to its viewers , some of whom were n't even born when the tragedy occurred			1
the @entity125 will feature a week of programming starting august 28 , including an exclusive sit - down with former president @entity128 , who was in office on 9/11			1
@entity130 , senior vice president of production for the channel , said the abundance of programming just makes sense			0
" seems to me you probably could do more than a week and still not get at all of the issues and angles we need to get at , " he said			0
" we 're actually concerned about making sure the viewer has enough information and a depth of it			0
" @entity143 , founding director of the @entity144 for @entity145 and @entity44 at @entity146 , said such coverage is easily planned , as the anniversary is expected			1
" you ca n't predict a tsunami , but anniversaries are kind of like royal weddings in that you know when they are going to happen and you can put them together , " he said			0
" and let 's face it , this programming is for the most part relatively inexpensive to do			0
it 's playing clips and putting stuff together and all the rest of it			0
" anniversaries have always been important culturally , he said , and he points to the @entity166 in @entity167 in 1893 , which famously celebrated the 400th anniversary of @entity170 ' arrival in the @entity171			1
coverage of anniversaries has exploded , in part because of cable television , @entity143 said			1
" there are so many hours of cable television to fit this stuff into , " he said			1
" where it used to be you might recognize a special , but when there were only three networks , there were n't that many hours to fit it in			0
" @entity185 wonders how much coverage viewers can take			0
she wrote an article , " september 11th @entity189 tv specials scheduled : how much @entity192 ? " for the site @entity194 , and said she hopes networks respect the commemoration			2
" how much coverage we expose ourselves to and how we want to acknowledge the anniversary is our choice , " @entity195 said in an e-mail to @entity0			2
" the advertisements for these programs could present an issue , however			2
" " with so many 9/11 programs scheduled to air , i would hope that the networks take a tactful , respectful approach to letting people know what they have available , " she added			1
" 9/11 is n't ' @entity211 ' or some event that needs to be hyped up and sold to people in the days leading up to the anniversary			1
" at least one television drama will offer its interpretation of the painful look back			1
on september 7 , the fx series " @entity217 " will end its run after seven seasons			1
the show was inspired by the events of 9/11 and followed the lives of @entity22 firefighters			1
the series star and co-creator , @entity227 , told @entity229 's @entity228 that the timing fit			0
" there 's a natural summing up , of having the guys stop and think about where they are , " @entity227 said			0
" there are going to be memorials			0
we have to deal with 9/11 again			2
so it was only natural to end it this way			2

television will mark the anniversary of september 11 with more than 40 programs
the shows will lead up to and encompass 9/11
the fx drama " @entity217 , " inspired by 9/11 events , will end 4 days before the anniversary
