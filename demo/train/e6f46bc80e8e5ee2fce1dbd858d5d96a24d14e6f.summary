-- everyone wants to be more physically fit , but the toughest thing is finding motivation -- the motivation to get started , the motivation to keep going , the motivation to push yourself to the next level			2
a man tries out the @entity8 at a @entity10 launch party in @entity11 , @entity12			1
@entity8 does n't try to motivate you with before and after photos			1
it does n't try to motivate you with testimonials from fitness gurus			2
it does n't even offer you three easy payments			2
but it does entice you to get into shape by making working out look like fun			0
and that it does very well			0
in fact , @entity8 might be some of the most fun you can have by just more or less standing still , which must make it about as mass market friendly as any video game product ever was			1
@entity8 requires a @entity8 , of course , and it comes bundled with a balance board			1
but the entire setup does n't take up much space , and the board is no eyesore , either			1
unlike a bathroom scale that 's usually squirreled away in a closet or shoved into the corner of a bathroom , looking at it does n't make you feel guilty			2
designed to fit in with @entity45 living rooms , where space is usually at a premium , the balance board is sleek and elegantly designed			1
ireport.com : send us your @entity8 review it conveys cool @entity53 style with a streamlined appearance			1
it 's something you would n't mind having in your living room at all			2
one thing about @entity10 : they know how to make hardware that 's rugged but easy on the eyes			0
getting started with @entity8 is a snap , but you might have to get some bad news out of the way first			1
the balance board connects to the @entity8 through a @entity68 connection			1
you stand on it and use the wii remote to record your height and age			0
the balance board then registers your weight			2
from those figures , @entity8 calculates your body mass index ( @entity77 ) , a standard metric many doctors use to determine a person 's overall fitness , which you can track over time			1
oddly , however , there 's no easy way to just use the scale to see your weight without recalculating your @entity77 each time			1
the wii fit - ness program is organized into 48 activities divided among four general areas : yoga , aerobics , strength training , and balance games			1
you can choose to work through all four in one session or just concentrate on one			0
if you 've never tried yoga before , working through the 15 positions here are as good an introduction as any			0
all of them are done with at least one foot on the balance board , so @entity8 can measure how centered you keep your body			1
yoga is a great way to stretch muscles and joints out and to work on overall flexibility			0
as meditative as this physical activity would seem , you 'll feel the burn even before you reach any of the advanced forms			0
once you 're loosened up a little with yoga , you might move on to aerobics			0
the majority of these nine activities are basically variations of hula hooping , jogging in place , and simple step aerobics			2
the one exception is rhythm boxing , which you unlock later on			0
by turning these aerobic challenges all into minigames , @entity8 entices you to keep working on them to earn better scores and ratings			1
with the hula hoop , for example , you have to stand on the board and grind your hips to keep a virtual hoop twirling			2
later , you have to " catch " tossed hoops , and then keep them all twirling , too			0
@entity8 sets a mellow , steady pace for all its aerobic challenges , but it still manages to make your heart pump			1
if just the words " push " and " ups " makes you break out in a sweat , then you 've probably already surmised that strength training contains some of the most physically demanding @entity8 workouts			1
the torso twist and rowing squat are easy , but push - ups , planks , and even the lunges will show you what you 're made of			0
the push - ups in particular make you work extra hard			0
you do push - ups with your two hands on the board , but because it 's 17 ½ inches wide , people over six feet tall or with broad shoulders might find themselves with their hands positioned inside their shoulder width			1
while it 's certainly a worthwhile goal to build up to , it 's difficult to snap off a set of push - ups from that position			2
the balance games require you to just apply pressure to the board through your feet			1
skiing slaloms and ski jumping are fairly straightforward , but you can also walk a tightrope or try to float down a river inside a giant bubble			0
all of these are simple and fun , and they really do make you aware of how well you maintain good posture and keep your balance			0
however , they are also short and very limited in the variety of levels and layouts			0
could you do all these exercises and balance activities right now without @entity8 ? sure you could			1
but would you ? that 's where the @entity8 balance board comes in			1
just like the @entity180 itself , it just looks like something you 'd like to try out			0
but once you take that first step onto it , you might find yourself on the way to becoming more fit			2
