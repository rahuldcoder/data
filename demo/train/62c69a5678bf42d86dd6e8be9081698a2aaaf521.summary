@entity8 , later also edited by @entity13 , remains @entity15 's best - selling newspaper			1
here are 7 eye - catching disclosures from @entity17 of the @entity18 in @entity19			2
@entity20 round the clock the @entity7 carried out phone hacking on a grand scale			1
a @entity25 detective , @entity24 , told the trial that in the two years before the police pounced on the operation in august 2006 , @entity7 's private detective , @entity30 , and journalists made 6,813 calls to 281 unique voicemail numbers , or @entity34			1
calls to @entity34 were described as attempted or successful hacks of mobile phone messages			2
among those whose messages were eavesdropped leading politicians , such as home secretary @entity47 , in charge of police and the fight against terrorism , the @entity39 football manager @entity38 , and the actors @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , the current @entity44			0
the @entity25 estimate 1,000 people were hacked by the @entity7			2
hot line to @entity54 the @entity7 eavesdropped on the private world of @entity56 and @entity57 -- and @entity56 's then - girlfriend @entity54			1
their hacking was kept secret during the first , limited police investigation into phone hacking in 2007			1
but it was revealed at the current trial that the paper 's royal editor @entity64 had hacked @entity54 , the current @entity54 , 155 times -- including on @entity67 2006			2
he hacked prince @entity56 35 times and prince @entity57 on nine occasions			0
among the exclusives the @entity7 unearthed were that @entity56 got lost on an @entity72 training exercise and that @entity54 called him " babykins			2
rooting through bins although the @entity7 portrayed itself as a beacon of morality in a sleazy world , it appears it was not averse to picking through people 's bins in the search for a tale			1
on one of the whiteboards seized from his home in august 2006 , the paper 's private detective , @entity30 , wrote the word : " @entity90			2
" the word " binology " -- rooting through people 's rubbish to find interesting documents -- also appeared on an invoice submitted to the @entity7 by a private detective in 2001 , when it was edited by @entity13			1
she told the trial : " there was a particular private detective who worked for various newspapers who would go through bins , lawyers ' bins and high - profile people : @entity107			1
and he would sell that information to newspapers			0
" she said she might have had some anxiety about using binology			0
cash for defense stories while being edited by @entity13 , @entity8 paid a defense official for exclusive stories about the deaths of soldiers in @entity118 , military scandals and titillating examples of indiscipline in the ranks			0
in all the @entity8 paid Â £ 100,000 paid to @entity123 , a mid-ranking official at @entity125 official who liaised with the @entity125 's press bureau , between 2004 and 2012			0
the resulting headlines included : " mucky major 's a sex swinger , " " @entity129 feels privates ' privates " and " the @entity132			2
close the @entity7 ... and land a tv deal a month before the @entity7 closed , executives discussed closing it -- to help a controversial takeover			1
jurors were shown an email from @entity139 , director of corporate affairs at @entity140 , @entity141 's @entity15 newspaper arm , to @entity13 and another executive in early june 2011			1
at that time @entity143 had intensified its inquiry into hacking and a growing number of hacking victims were suing for breach of privacy			0
" this is why we should consider the shutdown option , " @entity139 wrote			0
" is the brand too toxic for itself or the company ? i believe it is			0
unparalleled moments need unparalleled action			0
you could be the person to save the @entity161 deal			0
" @entity161 was @entity141 's codename for its Â £ 7 billion bid for the @entity15 's biggest commercial broadcaster , @entity165			1
@entity141 abandoned the bid amid the furor over phone hacking allegations			1
from @entity169 with a kiss @entity140 had close links with politicians , particularly with former @entity15 prime minister @entity169			2
on july 16 , 2011 as the hacking scandal swirled around the company -- and on the eve of @entity13 's arrest -- the former @entity178 leader offered to help her prepare for an appearance before a @entity182 committee at which she would be grilled about hacking			2
@entity169 texted @entity13 : " if you 're still going to parliament you should call me			0
i have experience of these things ! @entity189 " she said she was " feeling properly terrified , " adding : " police are behaving so badly			0
" the former pm responded with help about the police interview : " everyone panics in these situations and they will feel they have their reputation to recover			0
assume you have quality @entity202 advice ? when 's the interview ? " later , @entity169 added : " i 'm no use on police stuff but call me after that because i may be some help on commons			0
@entity13 replied : " great			0
the affair that dare not be printed while the @entity7 exposed other people 's extra-marital affairs , its married leading executives were having one themselves , the court heard			1
on a computer belonging to @entity13 , detectives found a draft letter written by the former @entity7 editor to its then editor , @entity220 in 2004 which suggested they had been having an affair for six years			1
the prosecution suggested the closeness of that relationship meant @entity13 must have known about phone hacking when her lover was editing the paper -- which she denied			1
in a passage from the letter read out to the court by a prosecutor , @entity13 wrote : " the fact is you are my very best friend , i tell you everything , i confide in you , i seek your advice , i love you , care about you , worry about you , we laugh and cry together			0
" no @entity15 newspaper exposed their affair , though it made front - page headlines a decade later			1
when a lawyer suggested to @entity220 that the relationship was " pure hypocrisy , " he replied : " the irony is not lost on me			0

jurors returned their *verdicts* in the @entity15 's 8 - month - long phone hacking trial on june 23
