the @entity1 - controlled @entity0 passed its first formal budget proposal in four years early saturday after hours of non-stop voting that started friday evening			1
the non-binding plan for the 2014 budget calls for a trillion dollars in tax increases and passed 50 to 49			1
no @entity7 voted for the bill , and four @entity9 voted against it			2
it now goes to the @entity12 , where it is expected to be shot down			1
senators recently voted down a budget proposal passed by the @entity7 - controlled house			1
the two budget proposals and a third one to be offered by the president will likely be used as a basis for future negotiations between the parties			1
the @entity0 convened on friday morning , and voting started about 4 p.m. et , as lawmakers considered dozens of amendments to the @entity9 budget proposal			1
the " vote - a-rama , " as it 's known on @entity28 , typically is an annual affair each budget season			1
however , because it 's been so long since @entity9 put a budget on the floor , almost half the current senators had not been through the demanding and exhaustive practice			1
it involves the consideration of and voting on dozens of amendments to the proposed bill			0
the process took 13 hours and ended just before 5:00 a.m. saturday			1
@entity7 continues push for balanced budget as voting on final passage of the bill began , senate minority leader @entity42 called the session " one of the @entity0 's finest days in recent history			1
" " i commend everyone who has participated in this extraordinary debate , " @entity48 said			0
the proposal is supposed to set the funding levels for the various government agencies next year			2
but because those amounts were set already as part of last year 's debt ceiling agreement , this year 's budget is really a political document that outlines priorities for the democrats who control the @entity0			1
authored by @entity64 chairwoman @entity63 , @entity65 , the proposal increases government spending -- including repealing the automatic spending cuts required by sequestration -- and raises taxes on the wealthy			2
while it reduces the deficit over 10 years , it stands in sharp contrast to the @entity12 budget proposal , written by rep. @entity74 , @entity75 , that passed the @entity12 wednesday			1
the @entity74 plan slashes trillions of dollars from government accounts and balances the budget in just 10 years			2
in some years , the @entity12 and @entity0 budgets are reconciled , however , that is not expected to happen this year			1
" the budget we 're debating this week puts our middle class families first , " @entity82 said			2
" it reflects our pro-growth , pro-middle class agenda that the @entity89 people went to the polls in support of just a few months ago			0
" the top @entity7 on the @entity64 disagreed			0
@entity92 avoids shutdown , bickers over 2014 budget " our chair says this is a pro-growth , pro-middle class budget			1
i say it 's a pro-tax , pro-spend , pro-debt budget , " said sen. @entity97 , @entity98			1
" it 's a budget that comes nowhere near doing the things necessary to put @entity89 on a sound path			2
" while @entity9 leaders were confident the @entity0 bill would pass , there were several moderate @entity9 , including some up for re-election , who were concerned about the steep tax hikes in it and indicated they might vote against it			2
in the end , senators @entity113 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity65 - @entity119 and @entity120 , @entity121 voted against the budget proposal			1
" we 're going to have lots of votes today , " senate majority leader @entity124 warned friday morning , going into the session			0
" everybody is going to be tired			0
" @entity124 said 400 amendments had been filed , but he added that in most years only 25 to 35 are voted on during these extended voting sessions			2
each vote takes about 15 minutes to complete			0
the amendments are not - binding but still symbolically significant			0
this time there were 70 votes for 101 amendments ; some measures were agreed to unanimously en bloc after party leaders grouped the amendments together to cut down on time			0
some of the amendments were designed to put a political squeeze on members of the opposite party			0
for instance , @entity82 offered up @entity74 's budget for a vote , forcing @entity0 @entity7 to say whether they are for or against the deep spending cuts and entitlement changes in his plan			1
@entity9 argue the cuts are destructive and unrealistic			0
for his part , @entity97 offered an amendment to require @entity9 to present a budget that balances in 10 years -- something @entity82 's budget does n't do and president @entity159 's is not expected to do when he unveils it soon			1
democrats and @entity7 came together on one amendment that passed overwhelmingly			0
it would strip from the @entity164 a tax on medical devices that has been unpopular since it was created			0
other amendments dealt with a range of social and economic issues from raising or slashing taxes , preserving insurance coverage for contraception , hiring veterans , endorsing the @entity175 , repealing " @entity164 , " and prohibiting illegal immigrants from being eligible for @entity178 and @entity164 benefits			0
meat and poultry industry rescue federal workers the @entity175 amendment , offered by senators @entity183 , @entity184 , and @entity113 , @entity115 , passed by a vote of 62 to 37			2
though non-binding , the measure establishes the @entity0 's official support of the controversial project , and is symbolically important as president @entity159 weighs his decision on whether to approve construction of the pipeline			1
he is expected to make a final decision sometime this summer			0
the @entity0 also passed -- by a vote of 99 to 0 -- an amendment put forth by sen. @entity195 , @entity196 , to end so - called " @entity197 " financial advantages for megabanks , defined as any bank that has more that $ 500 billion in total assets			2
" this amendment is very simple			0
it says we should do away with the federal policies that create that subsidy , that uneven playing field , " @entity195 said			0
" it does n't say it would forcibly break up the banks , it does n't say we would tax them			0
" this year , senators had an extra personal incentive to pass a budget plan			2
that 's because of a new " no budget , no pay " provision that says if a budget is not passed by april 15 , senators ' salaries will be held in escrow until a budget is approved			1
that threat is now off the table , though an amendment asking all senators to donate 20 percent of their own salaries to a charity of their choice did pass by a voice vote			1
@entity7 @entity235 sen. @entity234 offered the measure so that @entity227 " would feel what other people are feeling because of the sequestration			0
" lawmakers ' salaries were not affected by the forced spending cuts that took effect on march 1 , because the @entity244 requires a new law to be passed in order to alter congressional compensation			0
@entity234 's amendment establishes a deficit - neutral reserve fund to broaden the effects of the spending cuts			0
@entity252 to close 149 regional airport control towers , spare 40 others			0

senators approve a measure requiring them to donate 20 *%* of their salaries to charity
the @entity12 is expected to dump the @entity0 2014 budget proposal ; the @entity0 shot down the @entity12 's
president @entity159 is to present his budget proposal next month
senators voted for 13 hours until just before 5:00 a.m.
