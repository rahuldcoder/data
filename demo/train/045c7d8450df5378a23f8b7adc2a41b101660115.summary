-- " i may have spoken too soon , " @entity0 said the other afternoon , with a sardonic laugh that did n't carry much mirth			1
he and i had first met exactly three years ago -- on september 18 , 2008 , toward the end of that frightening week when the @entity7 economy seemed to be on the verge of disintegrating			1
@entity12 had collapsed , @entity11 had been taken over by @entity13 , the stock market had plummeted , and the " too - big - to - fail " theory that would lead to the bailout of the major banks was forming			1
not that @entity0 was a player in those @entity20 and @entity21 machinations			1
he was a small businessman in @entity22 , @entity23 , a borough of about 18,000 people			1
or -- more accurately -- he was about to become a small businessman in @entity22			1
in what would be described as the worst @entity7 economic climate since the @entity28 , @entity0 was getting ready to open the doors of a new restaurant on the town square			1
i 'd been in @entity22 interviewing longtime merchants about what rough financial times meant for them			1
and it was the new guy on the town square -- @entity0 -- who sounded , in the face of everything , optimistic			1
" some time to open a new business , right ? " he 'd said as we had stood outside the restaurant looking at the old county courthouse across the way , as carpenters inside his building readied it for opening day			1
" but i feel good			1
" of the national economy , he 'd said : " it 'll all come back			1
history shows us that , does n't it ? it always comes back			0
" i 'd been thinking about him in recent days -- wondering how his restaurant had ended up doing , and whether he is as upbeat as he had seemed three years ago			1
i wanted to talk with him not because he is an expert in the intricacies of global finance , but precisely because he is not			0
he and small businesspeople like him are on the receiving end of the @entity20 decisions and convulsions that can lead to times as brutal as the ones the country has been dealing with			0
i just wanted to find out what was going on at his place on the @entity22 town square			1
" i never thought the bad economy would be lasting this long , " he said			1
the restaurant he opened is called @entity69			2
it 's not a big establishment : 36 seats , 11 tables , open for lunch and dinner			2
" i had thought it would take us two years to become solid and feel that we 'd made it , " he said			2
" now i 'm thinking it will take four years or more			0
people are n't eating out at restaurants as much as they would be in good times , because it 's a way they can cut back on their expenses			1
" he said he does n't have to follow the stock market on a minute - to - minute basis to know how money worries and layoffs are affecting his customers			2
" the first thing you notice is that people will come in less frequently -- they 'll still be loyal and come , but not as often as they might			2
this is a small town , and i know my customers			2
i know when i do n't see them			0
" going out to a restaurant is a luxury that can be scratched off			2
i 'll see it in the individual dinner orders			0
a couple who would usually order two main dishes might order one and ask to split it			0
they 'll skip the salad			0
maybe they 'll skip the dessert			0
i do n't blame them -- it 's a way to save a little more money			2
" he finds himself in the same position as his guests : " people are pinching pennies out of necessity , and i am , too			2
i have 13 people working for me -- cooks , servers , hostesses , utility people			1
ideally , i should have 17			0
but to warrant new hiring , i 've got to have the right amount of business coming in , and i do n't			2
" i just spent $ 18,000 to put in a walk - in refrigerator / freezer			0
that 's a huge chunk of change for a small operation like mine			2
i waited 2 1/2 years to take that plunge			0
" would i love to have another chef on staff ? absolutely			0
but my sales figures do n't justify it			0
i ca n't afford it			0
i do the cooking myself two or three nights a week			0
" @entity0 is 56 and has been in the restaurant business for 30 years , he says , " and i 'd be the first to know if i thought my quality was down , or the service was not what it should be			1
even in good times , if you have a good product , a good location , good service , making a business a success requires good luck , too			2
no one guarantees that you 're going to make it			0
" but in this economy , with this kind of joblessness , making a go of a small business becomes even more of a challenge			1
" he feels a little cynical about the too - big - to - fail mantra that bailed out the major banks			0
" there 's no ' too small to fail ' for businesses like ours			0
no one 's going to save us if we ca n't make it			0
" he said that since opening he has always met his payroll and always paid his vendors , but that with revenues about 20 to 25 percent less than what he would like them to be , " there have been more than a few weeks when i have n't been able to pay the last person who gets paid : me			1
" when things are tough , he does n't have to ask his customers to explain , because " i can see it			0
you know how people look when it 's been raining for two straight weeks -- tense , a little down ? that 's the look , even when the sun is out			1
" yet the high hopes he had for his business when he and i met three years ago are still there , and so is the pride in what he -- like so many small business people across the country in this economy -- is trying to do : " just being proud of what you 've built			1
being a part of the life of the town			0
i like it that i have afforded 13 people a living for almost three years now			1
@entity198 's coming , and sales tend to go down in the winter , at the same time the energy costs for heating this place go up			0
but that 's all right			0
we 've got a business right here in the center of town , and it was n't here before we built it , and we 're going to make it			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			1

@entity214 says he met @entity0 in 2008 in @entity22 , @entity23
he says @entity0 was opening a restaurant just as the economy was *tanking* ; he 's still hopeful
he says customers feel pinch ; it affects business , but *unlike* banks no one bails him out
@entity214 : @entity0 has hung on , employing 13 people , determined to succeed in his *community*
