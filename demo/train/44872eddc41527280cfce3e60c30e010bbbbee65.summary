@entity0 -- @entity3 gov. @entity2 is right to immediately send 1,000 @entity5 troops to the @entity8 - @entity7 border in response to the border kids crisis			1
in fact , " immediately " was n't soon enough			0
while @entity2 has been demanding that the @entity14 administration send in the troops for several weeks now , the governor should n't have wasted his time trying to get the folks in @entity18 to focus on a border that president @entity14 did n't even bother to visit recently when he was doing a fundraiser in @entity21 just 500 miles away			1
for those @entity8 in both parties who think the @entity8 is undergoing an invasion from the @entity26 , it makes perfect sense to call out the troops			1
i 'm not in the " invasion " crowd			0
after 25 years of writing about immigration , and a half - dozen trips to the @entity8 - @entity7 border , i know this much : what we see down there is n't comparable to the encroachment of a foreign army			2
most of it is more like a jobs fair , where people from poor countries in @entity44 -- especially @entity7 -- go north to do jobs that @entity8 are n't doing or wo n't do for anything less than bankers ' wages			1
in the last few months , due to the humanitarian crisis involving at least 57,000 unaccompanied minors who have crossed the @entity8 - @entity7 border since october 2013 , we 've seen the rest of the story -- that some of what goes on down there is tantamount to a fire drill , where the frightened and desperate jump out of a burning building and into what they hope is the warm embrace of a compassionate neighbor			2
the real reason that @entity2 is right to send the @entity5 to the border is not what you 'll hear from conservatives who continue to show through their rhetoric and rants that they do n't have the foggiest understanding of that part of the world			1
key questions about @entity2 's border plan some folks on the right probably think that , under what @entity2 has in mind , there will be armed troops standing guard on the line and apprehending unauthorized border crossers , including children			1
that 's not going to happen			0
can you imagine the horrible optics of that kind of operation , or the international incident that would be created if -- heaven forbid -- a soldier were to hurt a child ? as a likely 2016 presidential candidate , @entity2 would never risk that possibility			0
let 's remember that , in 2012 , during an earlier and unsuccessful bid for the @entity100 nomination , the governor went after members of his own party			0
defending his support for a @entity3 law that let undocumented students pay in - state tuition , @entity2 said that @entity100 critics who had a problem with that did n't " have a heart			1
" now , encouraging a confrontation between armed soldiers and a bunch of underage refugees would show that @entity2 does n't have a brain			0
so , we can expect the @entity5 to be used much the same way that @entity118 twice used it during his presidency -- as a support system for the @entity121 , intended to free up personnel by relieving some of the more mundane duties that occupy the time of those who are supposed to be guarding our borders			1
do n't be surprised if the troops wind up freeing up border patrol agents to get out and patrol by doing paperwork , transporting those in custody , fixing vehicles and performing other essential tasks that do n't force a confrontation between soldiers and children			1
@entity2 told reporters this week that the guard would be " force multipliers " who help border patrol agents catch those crossing the border who are n't children -- which may be the majority at this point -- and to combat ancillary crime associated with smuggling and drug cartels			2
my sources on the border tell me that 's the real and untold story here			0
it 's not the kids			0
it 's just how much unabated street crime is occurring every day in the border region , now that so much of the @entity121 is tied up babysitting the lost children of @entity159			0
most @entity8 who are unfamiliar with the border do n't realize that , under normal circumstances ( and we 're a long way from there ) , @entity121 agents do n't just keep away uninvited visitors			2
they also act as a deterrent to the host of street crimes that bad guys might engage in along the border that has nothing to do with immigrants : drug dealing , shootouts , robbery , sexual assault , cartels raiding stash houses and stealing from one another , etc. that is what is going on at our back door as we speak			0
the @entity121 can stop some of it , but only if the @entity5 frees its hands to do so			2
all that at a price tag of $ 12 million a month , with @entity3 being forced to pick up the tab			2
meanwhile , two of @entity2 's fellow border governors â € ” @entity192 gov. @entity191 , a @entity193 , and @entity7 gov. @entity194 , a @entity100 â € ” have already said they have no plans to send @entity5 troops to the border			1
once again , @entity3 is going its own way			0
appearing at the press conference with @entity2 , @entity3 adjutant general @entity199 said the troops could detain people if they were asked to do so , but emphasized that they will primarily play a " referring and deterring " role by referring immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally to other agencies and deterring cartel activity by their very presence			1
let 's hope it 's enough			0
but for now , @entity8 need to get behind the idea of using @entity5 troops on the border -- which , frankly , had to come from the states because it reeks of too much common sense to have ever come from the current occupant of the @entity218			1
join us on @entity221 / @entity220 .			0
