-- spending 24 hours in @entity1 is not for the faint - hearted			1
the legendary @entity3 motor race is for the fearless , the global players , the 24 - hour party people			1
it 's a feat of endurance for drivers , engineers , car manufacturers , media and fans alike			1
but , if you can muster the strength , the rewards are great ; the experience exhilarating			0
in the equivalent of 16 @entity21 races completed back to back , the professional drivers take on treacherous night conditions and the risk of an accident with one of the amateur entries -- one @entity28 star ended last weekend 's race in hospital after a spectacular spill			1
but the racing is only half of the story			0
car corporations spend millions showcasing innovative technology , while off the track fans parade in all manner of costumes			0
on sunday @entity40 continued its recent dominance of an event that dates back to 1923 , as @entity44 driver @entity43 took the checkered flag for the second successive year the @entity47 circuit in the heart of the @entity3 countryside is a @entity50 for motorsport fans , and the race provides a unique challenge for competitors that ranks alongside @entity56 's @entity55 and the @entity58 ' @entity57 as the sport 's blue riband events			1
asked to sum up what makes @entity1 so special , the reliably succinct television commentator @entity61 resorted to reeling off a list			2
" the track , the ambiance , the crowd , the titanic challenge of the phases of the race , you versus the track , you versus the elements , 30 scheduled pit - stops ... " began the 53 - year - old , an @entity65 driver and a winner at @entity1 in 1990			1
he finished 15th overall on sunday in his first @entity1 race since 2001 , competing alongside his son @entity80 on @entity81			1
" it 's just an incredibly complex challenge			0
we do the equivalent of 16 f1 races in a day if we get to the end of the race -- that 's how tough it is , " @entity61 said			1
the drivers of the 35 cars that finished last weekend 's race certainly earned a rest -- and a shoulder - rub or two -- in the days that follow @entity1			1
each car had a rotating three - man team of drivers assigned blocks of 45 - minute slots behind the wheel , although it was normal for them to stay out on track , pushing on for more than two hours			2
for many , the biggest challenge is " the graveyard shift " when the sun sinks , leaving unblinking headlights and the neon streaks of passing cars to guide the drivers round pitch - black corners			2
" at night it feels like a video game , " said former f1 driver @entity113 , after becoming the first @entity114 to race at @entity1			1
" it 's so surreal because you 're through the forest and all you 've got are the headlights , the led dashboard and lights coming towards you			0
" driving through the night is just one hazardous allure of @entity1			2
the race is also fraught with potential dangers because it invites four classes of cars of variable speeds as well as professional and amateur drivers to compete together			2
@entity131 's @entity130 , another former @entity56 driver , is recovering after breaking his back when his front - running @entity133 was tipped upside - down and into the air in a collision with a @entity137 sportscar driven by a 52 - year - old amateur			2
@entity130 , who cheerily tweeted he was " happy to be alive , " knows , just like any racer , that rewards in this sport come with the caveat of great risk			0
the potential rewards for car manufacturers at @entity1 are no less significant			0
@entity40 's entries put on an ultimate show of strength for their brand , powering to all three overall podium places and the manufacturer 's 11th @entity1 win in 12 years			1
but rumors in the @entity1 paddock suggested the @entity44 car company spends at least $ 125 million a year on research and development alone for its @entity1 on - track project			1
the @entity58 @entity160 team won the junior lmp2 category , while the @entity164 @entity163 team won the professional race for sportscars			0
race organizers , the @entity168 , also encourage car manufacturers to invest in testing and showcasing new technologies -- especially those with relevance to future road cars -- during the race weekend			0
@entity40 made history by winning the classic race in a diesel - hybrid car for the first time			1
a hybrid car uses two types of technology for energy ; @entity40 also adopted an electric flywheel system devised by the @entity56 team to help power the car			0
@entity133 , whose two cars were unfortunate non-finishers , had returned to @entity1 for the first time in 13 years to showcase the @entity193 firm 's petrol - electric hybrid technology			1
but the car that set pulses racing was the sleek , black @entity58 - built @entity196 , cherished because it dared to be different -- and because of its resemblance to " the @entity198			0
" highlighting " downsized technology , " the car -- invited to race as a guest entry -- was half the weight of a typical @entity1 prototype and designed to consume half the usual fuel and tires			2
the demise of the @entity196 , after it was cruelly thumped into the barriers by a @entity133 in the first half of the race , seemed only to further fan the flames of fervor			0
race organizers plan to invite a hydrogen - fueled prototype to take part in 2013			0
while the asphalt hummed with this year 's race cars , the service roads thronged with shuttles and golf buggies chauffeuring corporate guests to hospitality , helicopters and product launches in a 24 - hour marketing assault			1
" @entity230 shows are irrelevant for fans , we need to get to our customers and be close to the fans on and off the track at events like this , " said the general manager of @entity227 , @entity228			0
with 55 assorted cars starting the race -- from @entity40 juggernauts to the racy corvettes and @entity243 -- there was plenty to quench the 250,000 car - thirsty fans who flocked to @entity3			1
there will also be plenty of pilgrims returning with less fragrant memories of a few days spent in a @entity3 field			0
memories perhaps of men dressed as @entity254 , complete with lifeguards , swaying mounds of glass beer bottles , $ 18 pizzas , a motorized wheelbarrow with a perilous pace and the whiff of rubber from an improvised burnout drag strip along the service roads			0
@entity1 is a brilliant event to " endure " with relish -- but perhaps it 's a relief that it comes but once a year .			2

@entity1 24 - hour race is an endurance test for fans , as well as drivers
classic race first staged in 1923 and regarded as one of motorsport 's blue riband events
finishing teams complete the equivalent of 16 @entity21 races
@entity40 's *victory* on sunday was the manufacturer 's 11th @entity1 win in 12 years .
