@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 @entity3 approved tuesday a law banning any veils that cover the face -- including the burqa , the full - body covering worn by some @entity10 women -- making @entity1 the first @entity12 country to plan such a measure			1
the law passed by a vote of 246 to 1 , with about 100 abstentions coming essentially from left - leaning politicians			2
the legislation was overwhelmingly approved by the lower house of parliament in july and will go into effect next spring			1
@entity1 people back the ban by a margin of more than four to one , the @entity25 found in a survey earlier this year			1
some 82 percent of people polled approved of a ban , while 17 percent disapproved			0
that was the widest support the @entity30 - based think tank found in any of the five countries it surveyed			0
clear majorities also backed burqa bans in @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , while two out of three @entity39 opposed it , the survey found			0
a panel of @entity1 lawmakers recommended a ban last year , and lawmakers unanimously passed a non-binding resolution in may calling the full - face veil contrary to the laws of the nation			1
" given the damage it produces on those rules which allow the life in community , ensure the dignity of the person and equality between sexes , this practice , even if it is voluntary , can not be tolerated in any public place , " the @entity1 government said when it sent the measure to parliament in may			1
the law imposes a fine of 150 euros ( $ 190 ) and / or a citizenship course as punishment for wearing a face - covering veil			1
forcing a woman to wear a niqab or a burqa will be punishable by a year in prison or a 15,000 - euro ( $ 19,000 ) fine , the government said , calling it " a new form of enslavement that the republic can not accept on its soil			2
" the @entity1 @entity76 has warned that the ban could be incompatible with international human rights laws and the country 's own constitution			2
the council advises on laws , but the government is not required to follow its recommendations			0
the ban pertains to the burqa , a full - body covering that includes a mesh over the face , and the niqab , a full - face veil that leaves an opening only for the eyes			0
the hijab , which covers the hair and neck but not the face , and the chador , which covers the body but not the face , apparently are not banned by the law			0
however , a 2004 law in @entity1 bans the wearing or displaying of overt religious symbols in schools -- including the wearing of headscarves by schoolgirls			2
the @entity25 estimates that @entity1 has about 3.5 million muslims , or about 6 percent of the population			1
@entity1 does not keep its own statistics on religious affiliation of the population , in keeping with its laws requiring the state to be strictly secular			0
@entity2 's @entity113 contributed to this report .			0
