@entity75 , playing on his own up front , made it 2 - 0 in the 68th minute when he was first to react after @entity83 could only parry @entity101 's shot , then the @entity103 sealed victory 10 minutes later with a slick finish from @entity106 's low cross			1
@entity107 winger @entity106 , who signed a new contract during the week , then set up young substitute midfielder @entity109 on 82			0
third - placed @entity111 's title hopes were dented after conceding a late equalizer at @entity113			1
