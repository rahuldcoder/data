some residents of @entity1 , @entity2 , fear their community is creating a monster			1
the city calls it the @entity7 , but opponents call it a " spy machine " and a potential " tool of injustice			2
" known as " the @entity7 , " it 's a proposed central surveillance facility where authorities can monitor the @entity15 and the city 's airport to protect against potential terrorism			1
but the broader issue of centralized data surveillance poses serious privacy questions for millions of people in cities around the globe			1
in march , more than 100 worried @entity1 residents waited past midnight to complain about it during a @entity28 meeting			1
standing at the mic , @entity29 , a self - described public school teacher and @entity31 , warned lawmakers their proposal would be used to " discriminate against minorities and perpetuate racial , religious and political profiling			2
" while the council voted on the proposal , rowdy protesters began chanting , " no ! no ! no ! no ! " council members have proposed expanding the @entity7 to add live , 24/7 data streams from closed circuit traffic cameras , police license plate readers , gunshot detectors and other sources from all over the entire city of @entity1			1
the danger , say opponents , is putting all these data resources into one place			1
" if you need to go to four different locations to track someone 's movements across town , you 're not going to do it unless you have a good reason , " said @entity52 of the @entity53 of @entity2			1
" but when you can do it with the press of a button because it 's all at your fingertips , you 'll end up doing it based on your idle curiosity			1
" that , @entity52 said , creates a situation ripe for abuse			0
@entity1 represents just one battleground in a fiery debate about how cities should be using so - called " @entity76 , " especially aggregated video and other types of surveillance			1
city closed - circuit tv cameras performed famously when they helped identify suspected terrorists in @entity79 in 2005 and in @entity80 last year			1
community surveillance 2.0 but the issue has progressed far beyond the power of a few hundred video cameras and streetlight posts			1
community surveillance 2.0 is now all about huge data mash - ups and incredible software that quickly sorts through mountains of information			1
bottom line : a relatively small number of people have easy access to data that can track your whereabouts			1
in many cities , cameras mounted on police patrol cars gather video of millions of license plates			1
that data that can be used to track vehicles , possibly yours			2
add traffic cameras to the mix. then include cameras at bus stops , airports and train stations			0
how about cameras owned by schools and private security companies ? the key to using all this information is the data - mining software that can easily and effectively rifle through it			2
cities leading the way in video data collecting include @entity79 -- an early and strong adopter of widespread camera surveillance			1
the @entity124 reportedly has 5.9 million cctv cameras nationwide			0
for every 11 @entity124 citizens , there 's one cctv camera , according to @entity129			0
@entity130 , @entity131 , has been expanding its surveillance center , which is projected to eventually count one camera for every 500 residents			2
as @entity136 hosts the @entity137 and the @entity138 , the city plans to make heavy use of its @entity141 - designed @entity140 , which combines video and other data from 30 agencies including traffic cameras , subways and even weather satellites			1
the network includes more than 550 cameras , 400 employees and 60 different layers of data streamed from citywide sensors			2
mayor @entity154 says the center helps emergency teams warn residents in landslide - prone areas when to evacuate during heavy rainstorms			2
the center also takes credit for a rapid response to an emergency after a truck toppled a pedestrian bridge , blocking lanes on a major highway			0
@entity168 was back to normal within nine hours			0
read more about @entity136 's @entity140 in @entity171 , a company called @entity170 is using feeds from hundreds of traffic video cameras to study 10 million pedestrian movements each day			1
it 's using that data to help businesses learn how to market to pedestrian consumers			0
@entity170 also says it wants to use the data to help consumers with information such as when to visit your neighborhood coffee bar when the line is shorter			0
@entity170 says it does n't store the video , nor does their analysis involve facial recognition			0
watch how @entity170 uses mindblowing technology to track pedestrians @entity193 use a game - changing data mining software program called @entity196 that can claim the @entity197 as an early investor			1
watch how @entity200 police use @entity76 to fight crime lessons from @entity80 last year 's @entity80 bombings investigation showed how fast police were able to sift through mountains of surveillance data			1
after @entity79 's terrorist attacks in 2005 , it took thousands of investigators weeks to painstakingly analyze all the @entity211 footage			2
eight years later in @entity80 , the @entity212 was able to release blurry images of two suspects in just three days			2
read more about the pros and cons of security cameras but the facial recognition data tools used in the @entity80 probe was n't perfect			1
images of the two suspects were available in public data bases , but the computers that searched that data missed them , @entity223 's @entity222 reported last year			0
security analysts widely admit facial recognition technology is not yet good enough to spot a suspect in a crowd			0
read more about facial recognition tech studies trying to determine the crime - fighting effectiveness of cameras have been inconclusive			0
according to the @entity236 at @entity237 in @entity238 , urban surveillance systems have not been proved to have any effect on deterring criminals			0
but a study from the @entity242 says it depends on the circumstances			0
sometimes cameras can be a " potentially useful tool for preventing crimes " the study says , " when actively monitored			0
" meanwhile , @entity248 communities are taking steps to make their surveillance more robust			0
-- @entity251 : when the transit authority put more cameras in rail stations , crime went down , according to @entity223 affiliate @entity256			0
-- @entity257 , @entity258 : police plan a new crime fighting strategy that includes 27 video cameras placed downtown , according to the @entity263			0
-- @entity264 , @entity2 : the sheriff has asked homeowners and businesses to register their security cameras on the department 's website			2
investigators would contact camera owners located near crime scenes to search their video for potential evidence , according to @entity223 affiliate @entity276			0
even in tiny @entity278 , @entity279 -- population about 2,000 -- @entity223 affiliate @entity280 reports they 're talking about putting a camera down at the local @entity283 grocery store			0
cities looking for guidelines aimed at safeguarding surveillance centers from privacy abuses might look to @entity288 , which suggests putting systems into place that include mechanisms for transparency , independent oversight and accountability			2
privacy safeguards are being put in place in @entity296 , @entity2 , where leaders recently passed a law requiring all data captured by automated license plate readers to be destroyed after six months unless it 's part of an investigation			1
the whole issue is " very explosive " and the @entity303 recognizes this , said the @entity53 's @entity52			0
at the march meeting , after so many residents expressed their concerns , the council voted to curtail the scope of the @entity7 , limiting surveillance to just the port and the airport			0
the vote was 5 - 4			0
" there will be efforts in the future to expand the @entity7 to include city - based surveillance systems , " @entity52 warned			2
@entity1 mayor @entity319 has promised to look into what privacy safeguards might be needed before trying again to expand the scope of the surveillance center			1
@entity319 , who favors the @entity7 , told the @entity324 : " this is obviously an issue that is splitting the country			0
" what do you think ? do you believe one - stop city surveillance centers threaten your privacy ? share your views with other @entity223 commenters below .			1

@entity1 , @entity2 , debates creating a one - stop shop for video / data surveillance
opponents fear the ability to track people with " the press of a button " will threaten civil *liberties*
central data surveillance poses serious privacy questions for millions around the globe
operations in @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity136 have resulted in *success* stories
