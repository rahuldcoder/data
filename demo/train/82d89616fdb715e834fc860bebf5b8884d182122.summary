-- @entity1 , who stars in the agreeably shaggy romance / chase movie / @entity3 knockoff " @entity8 , " has a talent for playing sleazy - smart deceivers who have somehow held on to their innocence			1
in " @entity8 , " which he wrote and codirected ( with @entity15 ) , he plays a retired crook named @entity10 ( a fake name chosen when the character ditched @entity13 to enter witness protection )			0
squirreled away in a pastoral small town , @entity10 got involved with @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , a college professor who adores him â € ” but is also terrified by the fact that she knows next to nothing about him			2
looking at @entity1 , who has the lopsided grin of a happy - talk used - car salesman , offset by very serious eyes that perpetually study whomever he 's babbling to , we know just how she feels			0
when @entity17 lands a job interview , @entity10 agrees to drive her to @entity13 in his souped - up , death - black 1967 @entity29 , a road odyssey that lures out all the colorful underworld vermin who 've been waiting for him to emerge from the woodwork			1
" @entity8 " is filled with pop - up - book hooligans who ca n't stop talking : @entity36 ( underacting nicely ) as a dreadlocked sociopath , @entity38 ( overacting loudly ) as a gay @entity40 marshal so closeted he 's about to explode			1
the dialogue veers into digressions about @entity43 , the cruddiness of mainstream dog food , and much else			0
that these asides prove more fun than the central action is what gives " @entity8 " its flavor : tasty at times , even if the film evaporates as you watch it			0
