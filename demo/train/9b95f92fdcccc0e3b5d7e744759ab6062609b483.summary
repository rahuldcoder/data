do n't tell the kids , but we 've got @entity3 all wrong			2
countless @entity5 songs tell us that @entity3 is basically the @entity6 of juveniles			1
he decides who 's been naughty or nice , and doles out presents or punishments accordingly			2
but historians say @entity12 was originally created to keep adults , not children , off the naughty list			2
being crafty codgers , we ducked @entity3 's surveillance , turning the spotlight on kids and dramatically changing @entity5 celebrations			1
how did we achieve this very important historical victory ? picture this : it 's the early 1800s , and @entity26 's @entity25 leaders -- most of whom were protestant reformation - types -- had banned religious celebrations of @entity5 as unscriptural and paganish			1
but people still wanted to party			0
because , why not ? it was midwinter , the crops were harvested and sailors were waiting for better weather to disembark			0
so , on december 25 , working - class stiffs got fall - down drunk and stumbled around cities looking for stuff to loot			0
imagine @entity38 , spring break and @entity40 -- then smash them together like sumo wrestlers full of saki			0
that was @entity5 in the early 1800s			1
a bunch of blue - blood @entity46 decided all this fun must stop			0
" they wanted to domesticate @entity5 , bring it indoors , and focus it on children , " says @entity49 , author of " @entity3 : a history , " and professor of history at the @entity55 in @entity56			1
these grinches , who formed the @entity59 of @entity46 , would change the world with two little poems			0
but let 's back up for a minute			0
when the @entity65 came to the @entity66 in the 1600s , they brought a fellow from folklore named @entity70 with them , @entity49 says			1
@entity70 , who wore a red bishop 's miter and a snowy white beard , was based on @entity75 , a 3rd century @entity76 who lived in modern - day @entity78			1
despite being a bishop , this @entity75 was a bit of a bad boy			1
an archaeologist who dug up his bones in 2005 found that @entity75 had a broken nose , perhaps a result of the persistent persecution of @entity88 around that time , said @entity89 , author of " @entity90 who would be @entity3			1
" or could it have been @entity25 - on - @entity88 violence ? according to one medieval legend , @entity75 punched a heretic in the nose at the @entity96 -- the meeting in 325 that formed the first consensus on @entity25 doctrine			1
early icons of @entity75 depict him without bishop 's garb , a subtle suggestion that he had been demoted , possibly for fisticuffs			1
alas , the @entity106 rumor is not true , said @entity89			0
but people seem to love the story , which pops up like poinsettias on the @entity110 this time of year			0
thankfully , @entity75 , was known for more than brawling			1
he also had a reputation for giving gifts and protecting children			0
the first quality comes from a story about a poor man with three young daughters			0
without a dowry to offer suitors , the man worried that his daughters would fall into prostitution			0
legend has it that @entity75 dropped three bags of gold through an open window in the man 's house , saving the women from the streets			1
the second story is a bit macabre : while staying at an inn , @entity75 discovered three dismembered children in pickle barrels			1
he reassembled and resurrected the briny kids and punished the guilty innkeeper			0
these deeds , along with his everyman persona , ( he was n't a martyr or hermit like so many other model @entity88 of the time ) , made @entity75 the greatest male saint of the @entity144 , said @entity49			1
one measure of his popularity is the looong list of people , places , churches and @entity25 groups that list @entity75 as their patron			1
bowler , @entity3 's biographer , says that @entity75 's feast day , december 6 , ( the day he supposedly died ) was celebrated across @entity155 for hundreds of years , often by giving gifts to children			1
but , beginning in the 1500s , the @entity158 swept away the cult of christian saints , denouncing them as unbiblical and idolatrous			0
@entity5 , too , went pretty much by the wayside for much of @entity163 during this time			1
some countries , though , such as the @entity65 , kept alive traditions associated with @entity70			1
and it was these customs that 19th century @entity46 wanted to revive			0
as they sought to make @entity5 more family friendly , the @entity59 found the perfect front man in their namesake , who , after all , was known for being nice to children			1
it was a genius move			0
the real goal was getting drunks off the street , remember ? now they could do that by turning @entity5 into a family event when children -- who had it pretty rough back then -- would receive gifts for good behavior			2
but the @entity182 needed more than good cheer to change @entity5			2
drawing on the @entity65 legends about @entity70 , the @entity26 author @entity186 wrote a series of sketches featuring @entity75 soaring high above @entity46 houses , smoking a pipe and delivering presents to well - behaved children			1
about a decade later , in 1821 , an anonymous poem called " @entity195 , " featured a magical figure called " @entity197 , " who drove a reindeer - led sleigh full of " rewards " and filled obedient children 's stockings with little presents			0
building on that , an @entity205 scholar named @entity206 wrote a poem for his big brood called " @entity210			0
" it 's now better known as " @entity210			0
" strangely for a seminary professor , @entity206 's poem strips @entity75 of religious rhyme and reasons			2
@entity75 wears a fur suit , clambers down chimneys and gives presents to good children			2
but he says nothing about the " reason for the season , " as contemporary @entity5 warriors like to say			2
still , @entity206 's @entity75 story went viral , spreading across the northeastern @entity26 faster than reindeer on @entity226			2
in some early depictions , @entity3 looks like an overgrown elf ; in others , he looks kind of scary , as @entity26 artists merged @entity75 with @entity155 traditions such as the @entity233 @entity232 , who punishes bad children			1
by the early 1900s , @entity49 says , @entity3 became standardized as the white - bearded , red - suited , twinkle - eyed benevolent grandfather that we all know and love			2
and we 're not the only ones			0
" @entity239 seized on this guy right away , " @entity49 says			0
" they immediately saw the possibility that this personification could be useful in their selling			0
" in other words , @entity3 was pitching products almost as soon as he hitched up his sleigh			0
but before you blame @entity12 for commercializing @entity5 , think back to what it was like before he came to town , when kids -- and many adults -- really had something to pout about .			2

in the early 1800s , @entity5 in this country looked dramatically different
the original @entity75 was a bit of bad boy
when the @entity65 came to the @entity66 , they brought along @entity70
