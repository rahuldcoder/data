-- " dr. @entity0 , my daughter is so ugly			2
" a @entity5 mother in her 50s sits before me in the exam room , her teenage daughter next to her			1
" you need to fix her ugly nose , open up her eyes and give her a double fold of her eyelids , " the woman says			2
" okay , " i look at her daughter			2
" @entity17 , what do you think ? is this something you want ? " @entity17 stares at the floor , unmoving			0
then she speaks , eyes still looking downward			0
" plastic surgery is hot in @entity23			1
one in five @entity5 women from 19 to 49 have undergone cosmetic surgery , according to a 2009 survey from market - research firm @entity27			1
that 's reportedly compared to about one in 20 in the @entity29			0
visit the world 's plastic surgery capital although the @entity29 and @entity34 are the top two countries in sheer number of plastic surgeries performed , @entity32 and @entity33 are numbers three and four , according to the @entity39			1
@entity5 , with a population of almost 49 million , is ranked seventh			1
asian culture has embraced cosmetic surgery			1
unlike in the @entity29 , it 's no longer considered taboo to admit to having been nipped and tucked , even among celebrities			1
miss @entity5 2012 confessed to having gone under the knife , revealing , " i never said i was born beautiful			1
" interestingly , i find that the older generation often pushes younger people to have work done			1
i 've met several @entity5 parents in their 50s and older like @entity17 's mom who have no qualms about encouraging their children to undergo plastic surgery			1
they even poke and prod at their kids ' faces to suggest how a surgeon should improve their looks			0
the majority of facial cosmetic operations performed on @entity23 are considered " @entity66 " procedures			1
two of the most popular , nose jobs ( rhinoplasty ) and eyelid lifts ( blepharoplasty ) , are specially designed to make these features look more @entity73			0
2011 : plastic surgery boom as @entity23 seek ' @entity76 ' look asians generally have wider and flatter noses			1
@entity80 rhinoplasty narrows the nose and makes it project more , similar to a @entity83 look			0
@entity80 blepharoplasty creates an extra fold in the upper eyelid			0
while present in nearly all @entity89 , this extra fold occurs naturally in only 15 % of @entity90			0
while @entity80 plastic surgeons claim that these procedures are meant to retain their patients ' ethnicities and make them generally more attractive , i do n't buy it			1
to put it bluntly : facial plastic surgery on @entity23 is about making a person look as @entity73 as possible			1
and that 's a disturbing thought			0
full disclosure : as a young plastic surgeon , i trained in these types of procedures			1
i even performed a handful of them in my early practice			0
as a hungry young surgeon , i had no qualms about performing operations such as double eyelid surgery			1
the ethics of whether these procedures were right or wrong never really crossed my mind			2
and then a string of events caused me to reconsider whether i should continue to perform these operations			0
are these surgeries really the right thing for patients ? for society ? first , i encountered @entity17 and her mother			2
then , i received a request from a mom to perform an @entity80 eyelid surgery on her son			2
" he really wants the surgery done , " the mother said			2
" he wants to look handsome			0
" then i found out her son was only 8			0
and i had a daughter			0
the most beautiful girl i 've ever seen -- perfect in every way			0
she looks just like her mother , except for one feature that she 's inherited from her daddy			0
she has no fold of her upper eyelids			0
and i hope she never feels the need to change that			0
what do you think ? if you 're @entity80 , have you considered these types of procedures ? is it wrong for @entity23 to idealize stereotypical @entity73 features ? leave your comments below or on the @entity147			1
getting back at your ex -- by getting surgery the opinions expressed above are solely those of dr. @entity0 .			2
