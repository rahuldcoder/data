-- " you can hear the horse hold its breath over the jump			1
" @entity6 has been listening to sounds for so long , he even listens to their absence			1
@entity6 is not only a sound man , but " @entity10			1
" his engineering helped form the beating , surround - sound heart of the revolution in televised sports coverage			1
" if you listen carefully , " he continues , narrating , " you can hear the rider talking to the animal			0
" maybe a few choice words			0
" @entity6 is best - known for his work at the @entity21 , tackling the timbre of dozens of disciplines to captivate global audiences , winning multiple @entity25			1
he is the man who first gave you the sound of arrows fizzing through the air in archery , thanks to his brainwave of microphones between the archer and the target			1
more recently , his was the idea to place microphones beneath the wooden velodrome surface , to intercept the rumbling of @entity21 track cyclists in action			1
@entity6 's job is to find the defining sounds of a given sport , and bring them to your tv in the finest detail			1
he believes that while most people think they are watching tv , how they listen defines their experience			1
" the details really bring people in , " he explains			0
" tv is consumed in a casual way			1
rarely do you sit with full focus on the screen -- you 're usually there with your family , or your friends , and you 're talking			1
" it 's the sound that brings you back into the show			1
the detail pulls the audience back in			1
" the thing i like most about equestrian is that detail in the coverage			1
the little , bitty micro-sounds of the horses and the riders			1
" you can close your eyes and hear the image of a horse			0
there is so much there			0
" ask most people for the sound they most readily associate with equestrian sport , and the chances are it will be the hollow clang of a jump clattering to the floor			1
to capture that sound , @entity6 uses an array of small , wireless microphones attached to the jumps on the course			1
alongside those , sets of microphones normally used to record singers are placed around the edges of the arena to sample the hubbub of the crowd			1
( but never close enough to record your conversation			0
) back in the broadcast truck , a sound mixer then has the job of seamlessly threading between these dozens of microphones to create the finished tv experience			1
" the jumps are interesting because when they fall to the ground , it 's never a flat fall , " says @entity6 , as though describing an artwork hanging in a gallery , or a fine wine			1
" there 's a nice , resonant sound with an echoing tone			1
the camera may not be on that moment but , when you hear that sound , you know exactly what has happened			1
" but then -- and i 've thought about this recently -- you have to decide if you want to have a constant barrage of sound or a coming - and - going			1
we give the sound a chance to breathe between the jumps			2
the more you listen , the more natural it sounds			0
" like the horse holding its breath , @entity6 is a fan of quiet as much as he admires sound			1
" music today is so compressed that it never really breathes , and i hate to see television get that way , " he complains			2
" it does bother me that everything is driven by the narrator			0
you need to tell the commentator to shut up , and let 's just listen			0
" the commentator , as it happens , concurs			0
" i totally agree , " says @entity143 , one of the world 's leading showjumping commentators			1
" i listen to a lot of different sports -- including our own sport and how it 's presented in different countries -- and it 's definitely possible to talk too much			1
you do n't have to talk over every inch of it			0
" yet if you are watching at home , @entity143 's voice is as much a part of the soundtrack as @entity6 's breath - holding horse			1
" i grew up helping out at some shows			0
i used to be the man on the public address system			0
' please keep your dogs on a leash , ' etc. then somebody asked why did n't i try commentating , " @entity143 recalls			0
" i was naturally a very shy person , it was the last thing i expected ever to be doing			0
but you take on a persona , i suppose			0
" @entity143 now travels the globe , talking about horses for a living at the sport 's biggest events			2
" one of the main challenges is keeping it fresh , " he admits			0
" if you 're seeing the same top riders all the time , you want to keep up to speed on them			2
news changes so fast now , so you 're reading the internet all the time , looking at @entity180			0
" that side generally takes a lot more time than people think			0
today , for example , i 've been at the show ( in @entity186 ) chatting to everyone and getting more depth on how the horse is going , what they 're doing socially			0
" that gives me more color than picking up a piece of paper that simply says what they won at the @entity21			0
" the hard part is not talking , it 's preparing			0
" you now have @entity6 's carefully crafted natural sound of the event , dozens of microphones mixed into a delicate blend , lapping softly below @entity143 's narrative			1
there is at least one more element , though : music			2
not a feature in jumping , music is a required component in sister sport dressage			1
the freestyle routine , widely regarded as the climax of any major dressage event , demands that rider and horse move in precise harmony around an arena , executing precision maneuvers to a soundtrack of their choosing			2
once , comparatively little thought was given to the music used			2
now , dressage composition is an industry in its own right			2
@entity227 composed the freestyle score to which @entity230 's @entity229 won @entity21 dressage gold at the @entity232			2
" the @entity21 was the culmination of a lot of things , but making it was quite stressful , " says @entity227 of his patriotic theme , featuring " @entity237			0
" " at the @entity21 , we had to do that -- and it was quite regimented , in a way			2
" i had the most fun with the last freestyle i did with @entity244 ( for this season )			0
we could try some different styles of music			2
" composing the music requires a degree of precision you might not expect			2
@entity227 uses video analysis to fine - tune the rhythm and tempo of his composition , ensuring it precisely matches the expected movement of the horse at each stage			1
sometimes , he will never meet the rider or horse for whom he is composing , working purely from video			2
" for a rider like @entity229 , " he adds , " i 'll go down and watch @entity244 ride around , i 'll take several videos , and i 'll go back again to go through the music with her			2
" it takes a few visits to see the horse , get the footage , take it away and work with it			0
" sometimes , the riders give me free rein with the music			1
the top riders often have a clearer idea of what they want , and that can help the process but it can also hinder it			2
" @entity227 got started when he finished his music degree and found himself watching dressage on tv			1
( " when i saw it , it did n't seem like the music was fitting , " he remembers			2
) now , he is excited for the future			0
" there 's a lot going on in freestyle at the minute , " he says			0
" it 's really developing and i want to see how it progresses over the next five to 10 years			0
" people are getting better music and i think the judging will probably change , so it 'll be quite an interesting thing to be involved with			2
" it 's getting to be a big part of the sport -- it 's getting the crowds , and people acknowledge the music more			1
it makes the sport more accessible			0
" @entity6 , too , is looking ahead			1
" wireless microphones on anything that moves , in any competition whatsoever , is the future , " he declares			0
he sounds only half - joking when he adds : " we 're the ones paying for this			0
we 're the ones who 've got to put our foot down to these spoiled athletes and say , ' you know what ? you 've got to make it a show , you 've got to earn your money			0
' " we 've been asking to put microphones onto the athletes , and the horses			0
we 've not been successful yet , but i think , pretty soon , we will be			0
" on the horses ? " absolutely			0

sound engineer @entity6 helped revolutionize tv sports coverage
@entity6 uses dozens of microphones to capture detail of equestrian sport
he *prefers* commentators to keep quiet -- and commentators often agree
dressage riders get music custom - made using video analysis
