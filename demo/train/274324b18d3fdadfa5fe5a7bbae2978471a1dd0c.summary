@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 is running tests to try to figure out what caused an " unprecedented " six trains to break down , forcing the company to cancel all services this weekend , a spokeswoman said sunday			1
the company announced later that monday service will be halted as well to allow for more test runs			1
the cancellation of the @entity1 - to - @entity14 express train service stranded thousands of passengers on both sides of the @entity18 on the weekend before @entity19			1
" we sincerely regret having to take this decision and we understand how frustrated and disappointed travelers will be , " @entity4 said on its web site sunday			1
five trains with about 2,000 passengers stopped running friday night inside the @entity26 , also called the @entity26 , which runs between @entity27 and @entity14			2
a sixth train broke down saturday after @entity4 tried to run four trains from @entity0 to the continental mainland to prepare for the resumption of normal service			1
about 700 people were aboard when that train stopped in the @entity36 area of @entity37			2
@entity4 is making an effort to get about 500 people in " emergency situations " out of @entity0 , a spokesman said			1
they are being put on a regular train to the coastal town of @entity45 , @entity1 , taken across the @entity18 by ferry and then by bus to @entity48 or @entity49 , said the spokesman , who declined to be named			1
@entity4 is conducting a series of test trains sunday " to better understand the problems that have been occurring , " the company said			1
" we are committed to restoring our services as soon as possible but our key priority is the safety and comfort of our customers , " the statement said			0
those passengers affected by the breakdowns are being offered a full refund , another return ticket and 150 pounds in compensation			0
about 25,000 people should have been traveling on saturday , @entity4 said			1
the company is not taking any new bookings until after @entity19 , it announced , and is urging people not to come to the station sunday			1
" we strongly recommend that travelers whose journeys are not essential change their tickets for travel on a later date or have their tickets refunded , " @entity4 said on its web site			2
the trains became stuck in the tunnel because the air inside was much warmer than the air outside the tunnel entrance in @entity14 , @entity4 spokeswoman @entity82 said			1
" it 's a bit like taking a bottle of beer out of the fridge into a warm room -- within minutes it 's covered in condensation , " said @entity4 ceo @entity88			1
" we think that was the principle cause of the electrical failures on the trains			0
" @entity88 called the number of breakdowns " completely unprecedented			0
" @entity101 , which operates the @entity26 , said it evacuated all 1,364 @entity4 passengers who were stuck friday after the trains " lost traction , " but one of the five trains remained in the tunnel and was blocking part of it , according to a @entity101 spokeswoman who asked not to be named , in line with policy			2
the train that broke down saturday was being towed back to the tunnel entry so passengers could be removed and transferred , @entity4 said			1
the problems started after 9 p.m. friday when the first of the five @entity4 trains became stuck			2
it was helped out of the tunnel by a @entity101 locomotive , which took it all the way to @entity0 with passengers still on board , the @entity101 spokeswoman said			0
passengers on the second and third trains to fail were evacuated via the service tunnel to a @entity101 train , which brought them to the exit , she said			0
one of the failed trains was pulled out of the tunnel , but authorities were having difficulty removing the other , she said			0
the fourth and fifth trains were running close together when they failed , so @entity101 locomotives coupled them and either pushed or pulled them to the @entity1 side of the tunnel , the spokeswoman said			0
passengers from the fifth train boarded the one in front , and @entity101 locomotives then towed that train to @entity0 , she said			2
the @entity26 is two tunnels separated by a third and smaller service tunnel , so the train that remained stuck inside did not mean the entire tunnel was blocked , the @entity101 spokeswoman said			0
the @entity26 is 50.5 kilometers ( 31.4 miles ) long , 38 kilometers ( 23 miles ) of which are underwater			0
@entity88 said keeping passengers on the trains is the quickest and safest evacuation method			0
" because there were five trains , it took us ... longer than we would wish to get those trains out and those passengers on their way home , " he said			0
despite the stoppage of service saturday , noncommercial vehicles , including cars , motorbikes , and camper vans , were still able to travel through the tunnel			0
