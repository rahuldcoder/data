" i told mrs. @entity1 to sit on her butt and be quiet			2
" @entity1 , 37 , allegedly did not follow his order , getting out of the @entity69 instead			1
when the trooper warned her again , @entity1 allegedly told him she was a @entity71 citizen and allowed to " stand on @entity71 ground			1
" her @entity71 pride got her handcuffed			0
" i put my hands on mrs. @entity1 's arms to arrest her , " @entity61 wrote			2
" mrs. @entity1 was resistant but i was able to put handcuffs on her without incident due to mr. @entity62 calming her			2
" " do you know my name ? " the trooper recalled @entity1 asking him			2
