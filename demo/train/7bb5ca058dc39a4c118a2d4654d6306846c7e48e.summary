-- all singles in search of a whine-fest should roll right on past this train stop -- anyone who gets off at @entity7 's station will be served a particularly strong shot of truth			1
her first book , " find a husband after 35 using what i learned at @entity14 , " makes zero allowances for always - the - bridesmaid brooding			1
but for the woman who 's ready to vault to the altar , @entity7 has a promise : put yourself on a 15 - step plan she calls @entity22 , and you 'll have one foot in that @entity25 gown			1
five years ago , @entity7 launched her consulting business , @entity27 , in @entity28 and began teaching clients the same principles she 'd used in packaging products such as @entity33 water ( she once served as that company 's marketing manager ) and @entity37 jewelry			1
" i 'm treating singleness as a marketing issue , " says @entity7 , who calls her program a " strategic plan " in which the woman is the " product " to be advertised			1
" my program is for the woman who is sick of wallowing in why she 's single			1
the point is that she is -- and what will she do about it ? what i 'm offering her is an objective business perspective			2
" but does n't it seem a tad contrived to market a human being ? " if you were looking for a job , you could call it ' contrived ' to put your résumé online , ask friends for leads , and buy a new interview suit , " she writes			2
" but you 'd do it -- because you 'd be more likely to find a job ...			2
why is it different with trying to find a husband ? " @entity0 : 3 tricks for a happier marriage this from a wife ( and now mother of three ) who met her husband 11 years ago using her own step number 12 -- " event marketing : throw a @entity73 ! " which means creating a " strategic networking event " to showcase yourself			1
" i felt so fortunate to have found my husband and to be so happy , i wanted my single friends to have the same experience , " @entity7 writes			1
as her company succeeded -- " at least 80 percent of my clients have gotten married within 12 to 18 months of hiring me , " she says -- word spread			0
she then took her act on the road with seminars ( topic : marriage 911 ) and now claims that while a husband is not a panacea , she can tell you how to find a good one faster than you can spell @entity93 princess - cut diamond			1
the day i catch up with @entity7 at @entity96 's @entity95 , i 've come to see whether she can convince me -- the former chubby chick with the @entity97 -- that her techniques will work			1
i sashay in wearing a fire - engine - red dress ( in her chapter titled " @entity102 , " she suggests ditching all that black for a color that will differentiate me from the 32 million other single women my age -- 30 -- and older )			1
perhaps because she 's already married , she can justify her black suit , @entity108 chic as it is			0
our quick phoner the previous day -- we were two strong gusts of energy spinning toward each other -- immediately becomes , upon meeting , a whirlwind exchange of chatter and laughter that draws glances from a few blue bloods around us			0
@entity7 , who enunciates each of her syllables with @entity123 - teacher perfection , oozes intensity with every gesture she uses to punctuate her rapid - fire statements			1
she whisks me to an empty sitting room , seldom shifts her gaze from me as she listens to my dating history , then insists , as the pitch of her voice climbs , that @entity22 can rescue me			0
" when you sign up 100 percent for anything -- whether it 's losing weight , finding a job , or quitting an addiction , i have no doubt that it becomes a challenge you can rise above , " she tells me			2
" i 've seen what the power of focus can do for a woman who 's committed not just in words but in action			0
" @entity0 : test your intimacy quotient me , too -- which is why @entity7 is my kind of gutsy girl : all the kick of @entity150 on rye , minus any trace of baloney			1
as in this bit of bluntness she delivers in her chapter " @entity156 : bring out your rolodex " : " let me tell you right up front that you 're not gon na like this step ! " she writes			2
" but trust me , it can yield very good results ... you are going to call everyone you know and directly ask them to fix you up			0
" that means all human life forms currently listed in your @entity169 -- landlords , lawyers , grannies , hairstylists , florists , stockbrokers , long - lost gal pals from summer camp , former colleagues , and even old boyfriends you 're still on good terms with			2
oh , exhale : this approach need n't make you seem desperate			0
" each person will probably think you 're calling two or three friends , not two or three hundred , " @entity7 says			1
she estimates , based on her experience with clients and her business school training , that you 'll score one blind date for every ten calls			0
" why go through this torture ? " she writes			0
" this statistic says it all : ' fifty percent of people now married or living together were introduced by good friends or family members			0
' " after poring over the 15 steps -- everything from " @entity197 " to " @entity198 " ( " my approach gives you the tools to attract the highest number of men quickly and efficiently " ) -- i decide to test - drive creating a " personal brand			1
" " this is what sets you apart from your competitors -- and to be effective , it must be memorable and specific , " she explains			0
" @entity213 's brand might be ' outrageous , sexual pop singer			0
' we 're all multifaceted , so you need to give your friends who 'll set you up on blind dates a shorthand way of summing you up			2
" this , she says , derives from the business principle that a well - defined brand is essential to the success of any product , be it @entity227 fragrance , the @entity229 mail , or you			2
not only should your brand ring true to your " customers " -- the people you 'll ask to scare up dates for you or the countless men with whom you 'll click @entity237 glasses -- it should also be designed to attract the kind of partner you 're looking for			0
@entity0 : how to build intimacy in your relationships @entity7 has me draw up a megalist of my most appealing attributes , like " resilience " and " playfulness			1
" then i choose three ( " writer , " " warm smile , " and " grew up in @entity254 " ) as a basis for a brand -- " sunny girl from @entity251			0
" on the two websites where i 've posted a profile , i update my photo ( in the old one , we agree , the bad lighting does n't exactly say " sunny girl " )			0
i then begin " advertising " by calling every girlfriend i have and asking for a setup			2
this move alone nets me three dates			0
for those who snatch up @entity7 's book , i suggest enlisting the help of a supporter ( in step two , she suggests you find a " program mentor , " preferably someone married ) who wo n't be any less shy than @entity7 about delivering the hard news straight			1
( after seeing my potential online photo , in which i 'm sitting on a bed , she asks , " do you want a husband or a one - night stand ? " ) in this program , the truth is the essential bottom layer upon which your entire five - tier wedding cake will stand			1
within two weeks of trying @entity7 's strategies , i , the girl who once spent friday nights booting up @entity288 for an " @entity290 " marathon , am now juggling so many suitors that i 've started a " man - agement " diary			1
one of my dates has even led to a second , a third , and a fourth			0
what a difference a brand -- and perhaps 12 to 18 months -- can make			0
