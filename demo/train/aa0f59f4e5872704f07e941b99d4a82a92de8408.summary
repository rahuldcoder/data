-- the meeting on tuesday between @entity3 president @entity2 and his @entity5 counterpart , @entity4 , marks the beginning of a new phase in the conflict between the two countries			1
military analysts say that the date by which @entity2 could have safely hoped to initiate and complete a full scale invasion of @entity5 before the onset of winter has already passed , so the threat of an open military confrontation has receded and there is space to give diplomacy a chance			1
yet it would be premature to conclude that jaw - jaw is about to replace war - war entirely			0
if there are powerful forces driving both sides to the negotiating table , there are also major differences that continue to keep them apart			0
we can expect a tense and difficult winter ahead			0
the main reason @entity2 is now willing to explore a negotiated solution is that @entity35 sanctions are beginning to bite			1
currency instability , accelerating capital flight and vanishing growth rates all point to a deep and sustained recession if the current political uncertainty persists and @entity35 pressure is maintained			0
as @entity2 noted in a recent speech , @entity3 can not fence itself off from the outside world			1
there is n't a go it alone option if @entity3 is denied access to global markets and finance			2
@entity2 therefore needs to find a way of normalizing relations with the @entity54 and bringing sanctions to an end in exchange for stabilizing the situation and allowing @entity5 to function as a country			1
without this , patriotic fervor is likely to subside in the face of economic hardship and record approval ratings will quickly return to their pre-crisis lows			0
closely related to this is the fate of @entity68 , the territory annexed by @entity3 earlier this year			2
the picture emerging from the peninsula is one of steep price rises and acute material shortages as the problem of resupplying the territory without land access from @entity5 becomes apparent			2
a successful @entity3 invasion of eastern and southern @entity5 would have resolved that issue at a stroke , but with that option apparently off the table @entity2 faces real difficulties			1
what many saw as a geopolitical masterstroke in march is set to become a major financial burden stretching years into the future unless some kind of agreement can be struck			0
@entity88 and the @entity54 will never recognize the annexation of @entity68 , but arrangements for the supply of water , energy and other goods will undoubtedly form part of the wider negotiation			0
for @entity4 the issues are equally stark			2
the economic outlook for @entity5 remains dire unless the crisis can be brought to an end and the country is able to function to some extent as a single unit once again			1
@entity5 forces have made significant gains at the expense of the separatists over the last couple of months , but @entity88 probably does n't have the means to bring the insurgency to an end by military means alone			2
@entity3 's capacity to destabilize the east remains immense and recent steps to reinforce the separatists and " @entity120 " its leadership suggest that @entity118 is preparing to play the long game			2
energy is another area of concern for @entity4			2
in the absence of a new agreement on gas supply from @entity3 , reserves will probably be insufficient to cover demand in the cold months ahead			2
reverse flow from the @entity54 might help to mitigate the problem , but a harsh winter would leave @entity5 badly exposed			0
although both sides face major pressure to reach a negotiated settlement , they remain far apart on the substance			0
@entity3 sees @entity5 as part of its sphere of " privileged interests " and is determined to prevent the country moving closer to the @entity54			1
@entity88 wants to maintain an independent foreign policy , including the option of deeper integration with the @entity54			0
the terrain on which this struggle is being played out is the debate over @entity5 's constitutional future and relationship between the center and the regions in particular			1
in the absence of a friendly government in @entity88 , @entity3 is promoting a form of federalism that in reality looks more like confederalism			0
this would give @entity3 - speaking regions of the east control not only over their own domestic affairs , such as education , public services and the local economy , but also the right to determine their own foreign alignments , security structures and possibly border controls			0
the ideal model for @entity3 is the @entity170 that brought the conflict in @entity172 to an end in 1995			0
this created two constitutionally autonomous entities , each with a veto over foreign policy and other major national decisions			0
@entity3 has been able to forge close ties to @entity181 and relies on it to block @entity172 's membership of @entity183			2
for understandable reasons the government in @entity88 is unwilling to countenance an agreement on this basis			0
although it is prepared to cede much greater autonomy to the regions in crucial matters like language and education , it recognizes that @entity2 - style " federalism " would put a block closer ties to the @entity197 and become a ramp for the soft integration of its eastern regions into a @entity3 sphere of influence			1
@entity4 is under intense pressure , especially from @entity206 , to negotiate some kind of decentralized arrangement , but the separatists and their @entity3 sponsors show no signs of lowering their demands to the point where an agreement might be achievable			1
although an end to the crisis is to be hoped for , the starting point of @entity217 diplomacy should be that a quick solution is unlikely and that the reason for this is @entity118 's unreasonable expectation of a veto over @entity5 's future			1
@entity206 should stop pressuring @entity5 's leaders to consider proposals that would effectively lead to the break up of their country			1
instead effort should be focused on strengthening @entity5 's sovereignty and long - term bargaining power in relation to @entity3			1
measures to increase energy supplies , provide economic support and strengthen @entity5 's defense capacities over the difficult winter months ahead should be priorities			1
at the same time , economic pressure on @entity3 should be maintained and stepped up			0
this is a battle of wills and @entity2 wo n't reconsider his position unless the @entity54 is able to demonstrate the resolve needed to prevail			0
@entity245 : to punish @entity3 , @entity217 must be prepared to suffer @entity3 sanctions : which foods are off @entity3 menus ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 .			1
