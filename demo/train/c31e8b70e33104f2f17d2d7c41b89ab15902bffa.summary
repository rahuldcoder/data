@entity0 , @entity1 -- there is a long and growing laundry list in recent months of @entity1 butting heads with the rest of the world and , analysts say , the rest of the world had better get used to it			1
@entity0 barely flinched when @entity12 threatened to leave @entity1 , claiming to have been the victim of cyber attacks			0
additionally , the government here does n't seem troubled by being the lone holdout blocking @entity19 sanctions against @entity20 for its nuclear program -- @entity1 has the political muscle that comes with a booming economy and a political leadership which appears to be very self - assured			1
" well , @entity1 is certainly very self - confident , " said @entity26 with @entity27 , a research group which specializes in @entity29 ( @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity1 ) economies			0
" @entity1 suffered from the world downturn ... but it 's pulled itself out of that ... and the @entity1 are feeling pretty good and pretty sure of themselves , " @entity26 said			1
" it 's a bit like , say , @entity38 at the height of the @entity41 era or perhaps the @entity42 after the @entity44 ... they feel they 're on a roll			2
many analysts seem to point to the november visit here by @entity42 president @entity50 as some sort of turning point : despite two days of meetings with the highest levels of the @entity1 government , @entity50 walked away with very little			1
one of the big issues for the @entity42 is @entity1 's currency -- considered undervalued by 20 to 40 percent , giving @entity1 exporters a competitive edge			1
the currency issue has also been raised by the @entity61 and the @entity62 -- and the @entity1 government has stared them all down , declaring the currency a sovereign issue			2
" in the past , @entity1 could say , for instance of its exchange rate : that is a sovereign issue , that 's something only we can decide , it only affects us			2
but today that 's much more difficult of an argument to make , because @entity1 's decisions affect the rest of the world and everyone else in the world has an opinion about what @entity1 should be doing , " said @entity70 from @entity71			1
@entity50 's visit to @entity1 was followed by december 's @entity82 in @entity83 , seen by many as a disappointment			0
@entity1 came under criticism for the summit 's failures , especially from @entity38			0
it was the @entity38 again who were involved in a very open diplomatic spat with the @entity1 a few days later , when @entity0 executed @entity38 citizen @entity91 ; his family claimed he was bipolar and tricked into being a drug mule , while the @entity1 said he was smuggler and executed after being caught with about four kilograms of heroin , despite a direct appeal from the @entity38 prime minister @entity96			0
" i do n't think that @entity1 's relations with the rest of the world suddenly turned ugly , " @entity70 said			1
" any time you have a rise of a new power , this is going to upset the existing balance of things , there is going to be a big adjustment			0
" get ready for a few difficult months ahead when the @entity42 delivers the latest @entity110 missiles to @entity111 , and the @entity112 makes his first official visit to the @entity50 @entity114			0
and from an economic point of view , sometime this year , @entity1 may overtake @entity116 to be the world 's second biggest economy and looks set to continue to boom			1
" i think there is a real difficulty here for the @entity123 , " said @entity26			0
" one feels the @entity42 has n't really worked out what its @entity1 policy is			2

analysts say @entity1 is *increasingly* *influential* in global affairs
@entity1 stands alone in blocking @entity19 sanctions against @entity20
@entity1 may overtake @entity116 to be the world 's second biggest economy
one of the big issues for the @entity42 is @entity1 's undervalued currency
