@entity0 , @entity1 -- a judge on saturday barred environmental and consumer groups from participating in a criminal court investigation into the wreck of cruise liner @entity10 that killed at least 25 people , attorneys said			1

@entity1 's civil protection agency was also deemed an injured party saturday , attorneys said			1
the injured parties can present evidence and request additional analysis of any element of the investigation , attorneys said			1

@entity15 is a protected park			1
his first officer , @entity39 , and six other officers both on the ship and from the firm @entity42 in @entity43 are under investigation on allegations including manslaughter , shipwreck and failure to report the accident , @entity27 told @entity2			1
@entity39 's attorney , @entity50 , provided @entity2 with a copy of a court transcript of the interrogation of @entity39 , in which he tells prosecutors that captain @entity56 was n't wearing his glasses when he set the parameters on the radar system			1
@entity39 also told the prosecutors that during the voyage , @entity56 asked @entity39 several times to adjust ship instruments because he could n't see , the transcript says			1
@entity56 was in command of the ship at the time of the accident , @entity39 told prosecutors , according to the transcript			1

when asked by @entity2 about @entity39 's statements on the transcript , @entity56 's attorney , @entity82 , declined to comment			1
the ship 's owner , @entity88 of @entity43 , also was allowed saturday to remain as an interested party in the preliminary hearings , but not as an injured party , the attorneys said			2
the company is allowed to remain in the proceeding because the eight persons under investigation are the firm 's employees , the attorneys said			2
judge @entity98 , who presided over the near five - hour hearing , will rule on march 9 on when the ship 's black box will be opened and analyzed , attorneys said			2
the next hearing is set for july 21 in @entity103			0

@entity129 , president of @entity130 , the consumer advocacy group for @entity1 's tourism sector , said the judge on saturday barred environmental and consumer groups			2

on thursday , the prosecutor temporarily suspended the dna identification of the latest eight bodies found aboard the shipwreck last month			0

the expected resumption of the identification efforts was n't immediately known , attorneys said			0
one of those eight bodies is 5 - year - old girl whose identity has already been established without confirmation by dna testing , authorities said			0

of the 25 bodies found , 18 have been identified , authorities said			0
@entity174 , an attorney representing 67 @entity164 and @entity176 passengers who were aboard the @entity10 , told @entity2 that she made a formal court request that the black box data be analyzed from the moment the cruise liner started registering data -- prior to leaving the port of @entity183 -- to determine whether the officers and crew followed proper procedure and to determine at what point and under whose command the ship deviated from its route			1
@entity174 was also the attorney who represented @entity190 , the boyfriend of @entity191 , who were both convicted in @entity1 in the murder of @entity194 's roommate , @entity195			0
@entity190 and @entity194 both successfully appealed their convictions last year and were freed			0
@entity198 , 67 , a passenger on the @entity10 , said he attended saturday 's hearing because he is seeking to bring to justice those responsible for the tragedy			2
" we are here so those who lost their lives did not die in vain , " he told @entity2			0
" we need to understand who is responsible for their deaths			0
the captain did absurd things , but the black box will reveal who else acted irresponsibly			0
