@entity0 -- at 80 , @entity2 says her " knees are not all that swift and my lungs need some extra help but other than that , my desire to learn and to share , that has not abated			1
" @entity2 urges politicians to " aim for the high ground " in her new book , " letter to my daughter			1
" she shares what she 's learned in an eventful life in her best - selling new book , " letter to my daughter			2
" @entity2 achieved fame for her autobiographical writing , including " @entity18 " and her poetry			1
she read her poem " @entity21 " at president @entity23 's first inauguration			2
she was only the second poet invited to read at the swearing in of a new president			2
but her career has had many facets -- @entity2 has been a singer , dancer , playwright , director and teacher			1
in 166 pages , " letter to my daughter " distills stories from @entity2 's life into universal lessons			1
she writes about birth , life and death , about the ways people misunderstand each other and then transcend their conflict			1
she calls on national leaders to raise the country 's spirit and on @entity47 to remember that this is the nation that defeated the @entity50 and expanded people 's freedom through the civil rights movement			1
" politicians must set their aims for the high ground and according to our various leanings , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , we will follow , " she writes			1
" politicians must be told if they continue to sink into the mud of obscenity , they will proceed alone			1
" in an interview last week in her 1881 brownstone in @entity67 , decorated in vibrant , bright colors , @entity2 sat at the round table in her dining room , sipping coffee , as she talked about the election and her work			1
she supported sen. @entity75 's bid for the @entity58 nomination and then backed sen. @entity77 once the primaries were over			2
@entity1 : in the chapter called " @entity81 , " you call on political leaders to raise the level of discussion			1
could you elaborate on that ? @entity2 : what i 've encouraged voters to do is to vote for the person i am extolling , and also do n't expect that if your man or woman gets in , that all things will be rectified immediately			1
it 's taken us a long time to come to this place of weariness and almost hopelessness			2
so because @entity77 gets in or @entity99 gets in , it 's not going to be repaired overnight			1
the economy is not going to be repaired , the schools -- the disaster in our schools -- will not be repaired overnight			1
nor will the social conversation be repaired overnight			1
however , i would encourage every voter to say to his or her candidate , go in and do it , and you will not do it alone			2
you have to get up off that sofa or off that couch and give something to the country -- even if it 's one hour every other week to an old people 's home -- i will read , go into the children 's ward and read , or give to your church or your synagogue or your mosque			1
... offer something to the country			2
so you do n't just sit there			1
@entity1 : what does it say about the country that @entity77 is a candidate to be president ? @entity2 : the country is growing up and confessing to something we 've known all along			1
what prevented us from admitting that we knew that ? and i was taken back to slavery			2
if you will have a person enslaved , the first thing you must do is convince yourself that the person is subhuman			2
the second thing you have to do is convince your allies so you 'll have some help , and the third and probably unkindest cut of all is to convince that person that he or she is subhuman and deserves it			2
well , such a job has been done on all of us that people found it very difficult to admit that human beings are more alike than we are unalike			1
but to admit it , you have to stop saying because this guy speaks another language , because their eyes are shaped differently from mine , because they 're first - generation @entity47 from @entity160 , then they do n't count , i do n't have to consider them			1
with this , the country is finally able to see through complexion and see community			2
@entity1 : you 've known and worked with people like @entity167 and @entity168 could you imagine what their reaction would be to this ? @entity2 : i think everybody would be weeping tears of joy really			1
i think of my grandmother who raised me			0
she was a daughter of a former slave			0
she knew this was going to happen			0
you know that when i was young , i was physically abused and so i stopped talking			0
i thought that my voice had killed the criminal			0
... the man had been found dead			0
police said he had been beaten to death			0
so i knew , because i told [ people ] that he did it , that my voice could just go out and kill people			1
so after a few months , my mother 's people sent me and my brother back to this little village in @entity192 to my grandmother , my father 's mother who was raising me , and she used to braid my hair			1
my hair was huge and very curly , black			0
and my grandmother put her hand behind my neck and held it so she would n't break my neck by accident			2
and she would start to brush my hair and she would say , " @entity200 , @entity201 do n't care what these people say about you , that you must be an idiot , you must be a moron because you ca n't talk			1
@entity201 know when you and the good lord get ready , you 're going to teach all over this world			0
you 're going to be a mighty teacher			0
" i did n't speak for six years			2
she said that to me all the time , in this little village in @entity192			0
[ now ] i teach all over the world , i teach in @entity211 and @entity212 , so when i stand up on a stage or see a book of mine gets accolades or a piece of music i 've written , i think about my @entity201 , and she died before i really came of age , and i just think she knew it			0
@entity1 : she was prophetic about you , but beyond that ? @entity2 : yes , [ she believed ] it will get better			1
and you have to continue to prepare yourself , continue to build yourself , continue to elevate yourself and be a benefit , be a blessing rather than a curse , and things will get better			0
and they have , so when i think of dr. @entity168 and @entity167 , @entity229 , @entity230 , i also think of chief @entity231 , one of the first @entity232 to earn the @entity233			0
i mean that after @entity235 , apartheid was so rigid , unbreakable that men had to carry their ids on plastic cards that were too large for any suit , so they flapped , reminding them constantly who they were			0
it was my blessing to meet @entity243 before he went into prison and i 've seen him many times since			0
he knew this day would come , and to be able to stay in prison for 27 years , knowing that the day would come			0
@entity1 : what gave you the inspiration to call the book , " letter to my daughter , " even though you do n't have a daughter ? [ @entity2 has a son , the writer @entity255			1
] @entity2 : there was an @entity259 - @entity47 poet , her name was @entity260 ; she wrote a poem called " letter to my sister , " around the turn of the @entity265			1
... i started making notes to @entity267 [ @entity267 ] about 20 years ago			0
she really became a daughter to me			0
so there were things i wanted to talk to her about ; i made notes , copious notes , and about a year and a half ago , i got out that box called @entity276 , works in progress , and i started going through two or three lines and i said , " hmmm , there 's an essay in here			0
" so it is a letter to all my daughters , to those who do n't know they are			2
it is my intent to say you may encounter many defeats , but you must not be defeated			1
you will be changed , events will change you , but you have to decide not to be reduced			0
@entity1 : have you been in touch with @entity267 lately about the election ? @entity2 : i spoke to her about a week ago ... [ during the primaries ] , a newspaper reporter said this proves that @entity267 does n't listen to everything @entity2 says , because she was supporting sen. @entity77 and i was supporting sen. @entity23			1
and when i was asked by the reporter , " what do you say to @entity267 ? " my answer was , " i say nothing , she 's a woman who thinks carefully and profoundly and she has courage			0
so she 's chosen the person she thinks would be the best person for our country			0
" the primaries proved that @entity267 had selected the one that most people wanted , so i went to sen. @entity77 right after that			2
@entity75 ... telephoned me and thanked me for my unwavering support , and then asked me to please put that same energy behind mr. @entity77			0
@entity1 : another theme in the book is to believe in yourself , to have faith in yourself			0
why is that important ? @entity2 : you need to know that you can go somewhere			1
you 're not just like grass growing on the street			0
you 're like trees , you have roots , and they 've done wonderful things , and you need to know that , and by knowing that , you see how outfitted you are for these times			0
and that you really owe it to those who went before so that you can add to them for those who are yet to come			0
you need to know that you are in a continuum , and if you understand that , you realize that you are worthwhile			0
this continuum would be broken without me .			0

@entity2 : no matter who wins , do n't expect an overnight *turnaround*
@entity2 says politicians should raise the level of discussion
she says voting is not enough , people need to volunteer to help others
@entity2 : you will encounter defeats , but do n't be defeated
