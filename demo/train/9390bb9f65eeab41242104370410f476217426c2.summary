-- it 's the battle of the tech titans			0
no , not @entity3 versus @entity4			0
@entity5 has gone head - to - head with @entity7 after releasing their next - generation gaming platforms for the holiday shopping season			1
and according to a recent sales report , @entity5 's @entity10 seems to have won the first round of the battle			1
the @entity10 sold 1.25 million units in the @entity15 during november , while the @entity16 sold 750,000 , said @entity17 , an analyst at @entity18 , in a recent note to investors			0
as for global sales , the @entity22 manufacturer announced they had sold more than 2.1 million @entity10 units worldwide at the beginning of december			0
@entity7 say they sold over 2 million systems			1
with the @entity16 starting at $ 499 , and the @entity10 at $ 399 , @entity17 says the the $ 100 price difference is responsible for @entity5 's success : " the reason @entity5 beats @entity7 is solely the price			1
@entity7 loses the next generation unless they cut price			1
" in at the starting line from the start , it was far from clear which console would reign over the world of gaming			2
" these are two systems that are well - balanced to keep the furious battle between @entity16 and @entity45 going for the next decade ... which can only be good for gamers everywhere , " says @entity39 , chief video games writer for @entity41			1
the tech landscape has transformed drastically since the last time these two electronics giants went head to head with the @entity52 in 2005 and the @entity45 in 2007			0
back then , smartphones and tablet devices did n't even exist			0
while @entity10 is being touted as the perfect machine for social media lovers -- offering games that players can share easily with friends -- @entity16 is said to be ideal for those after a multimedia machine that can multitask and switch between games , movies , music and applications quickly and seamlessly			0
" the @entity10 has been set as more of a games machine versus the @entity16 's aim to be the multimedia entertainment center at the heart of your living room ... both systems are essentially pcs in a console shell , " explains @entity39			2
the two systems have everything from motion tracking and facial recognition to cameras and redesigned controllers			0
what 's more , the @entity16 can not only be plugged into your cable box for on - demand tv and movies , but can also be personalized to a user 's interests running a series of apps and programs , including @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93			2
smart strategies seven years ago , @entity7 pushed development on the @entity52 so that they could put their console on the market a year ahead of the @entity45			1
@entity39 says this move gave @entity7 plenty of time " to gain an audience within a gaming community where the @entity102 had previously ruled supreme			1
" " they gained a huge market share in that unchallenged year , " he explains			0
" @entity5 are obviously aware how this has affected their market dominance , so in this cycle of consoles they have made sure to release the @entity10 slightly ahead of their rival in the @entity15 to make sure they are n't left behind again			1
" at the industry 's @entity111 conference in june , not long after @entity5 went public with their early release date , @entity7 announced they 'd priced their console $ 100 more than @entity5 's @entity10			1
though the news did n't sit well with gaming enthusiasts , @entity7 refused to budge on the price			1
a gamer backlash ensued when fans found out the @entity16 was not going to allow offline gameplay or secondhand games to be used on the device			0
in turn , resistance from fans forced @entity7 to reverse its decision , explains @entity39			1
" @entity16 were wise to backtrack on their initial idea that you would n't be able to easily resell secondhand games or pass old games onto friends more than once , " says @entity39			0
" it showed a lack of understanding of the importance of selling on games for younger gamers , but also showed @entity7 's maturity in knowing when to backtrack if mistakes have been made			1
" the death of consoles ? in recent years , the video game industry has seen users develop a growing appetite for mobile devices			1
this has led some to question the future of the console industry			2
" rumors of gaming console death are a bit premature , " says @entity146 , a consumer electronics expert from @entity148			2
" it 's been a down year in 2013 [ for consoles ] , but going forward , this next generation is going to boost sales for several years to come			2
" industry analysts attribute few top game releases and the tail end of the last generation of consoles as contributing factors for this year 's downturn			2
meanwhile mobile play continues to grow at a significant rate			2
research firm @entity168 forecast in their latest report that revenue from mobile gaming alone is predicted to " nearly double between 2013 and 2015 from $ 13.2 billion to $ 22 billion			1
" " casual gamers i think have moved on most likely to mobile platforms			2
tablets and phones are cheaper [ and ] more easily accessible , " says @entity146			0
" these are impressive machines that have been released , they are enjoying great sales and beforehand , they were enjoying great pre-orders ... but the audience has shrunk and i do n't think those casual gamers are going to return			0
" so with casual gamers moving over to their smartphones , hardcore gamers have been left to save the console for future generations			0
@entity146 says : " [ @entity16 ] does gaming as well , but it is targeted towards a much broader audience and i think there is a risk in that gamers look at it and say : ' this is not for me , this is not built for gamers first ' ... but at the same time , if these functions do catch up , [ @entity7 ] stands to gain sales down the road			1
" meanwhile , @entity39 hopes that neither electronics giant will reign supreme as it means a better and more competitive experience for the fans themselves			0
" the joint dominance of the @entity52 and the @entity45 marked a great era for the gaming public , " he says			0
" with no monopoly , gamers get better deals on games and hardware after the initial round of console launches are out of the way			0

@entity7 and @entity5 release their next - gen gaming consoles
xbox one focuses on inclusive entertainment experience , @entity102 focuses on gamers
mobile gaming becomes fastest - growing area of gaming industry , say researchers
