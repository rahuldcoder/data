-- @entity2 's @entity1 was packed to the rafters : 200,000 expectant spectators prepared to celebrate @entity7 's first @entity6 triumph and its arrival as a football superpower			1
it was the moment the @entity13 country 's love of the game , and of its most prestigious competition , became a dangerous obsession			1
july 16 , 1950 , the final match of the final group stage			1
@entity7 faced @entity19 , and a draw would be enough to see the host crowned as champion			1
the champagne was put on ice when winger @entity25 gave @entity7 a 1 - 0 lead just after halftime			1
but the samba beat was silenced when @entity29 equalized for @entity19 -- and then the unthinkable happened			1
@entity31 : racism in football @entity19 came forward , @entity7 goalkeeper @entity34 stepped off his line , @entity36 scuffed a low shot towards the near post ... and the ball nestled in the back of the net			1
a nation 's hearts were broken			0
lives were forever altered and a national obsession was born			0
the 63 years since have seen @entity7 become football 's dominant force			1
the five @entity48 won by " @entity49 " is more than any other country in the quadrennial competition 's 83 - year history			2
but not one of @entity7 's quintet of triumphs has banished the shadow cast by the failure of @entity58 and his teammates			1
" the idea the rest of the world has about @entity7 , and perhaps @entity7 has about itself to a certain extent , is that it is all about ' joga bonito , ' it is all about the beautiful game , " says @entity60 , journalist and author of " the outsider : a history of the goalkeeper			1
" " actually it is all about winning in @entity7 , far more than anywhere else despite the perception , " he told @entity0			1
" there 's no such thing as heroic failure in @entity7			1
" @entity34 was named goalkeeper of the tournament , but he was scapegoated in @entity7 because of what happened in the final game			1
" he did n't get picked for the next couple of years			0
he was a very good goalkeeper , but all he is remembered for is that one mistake			0
" the error which led to @entity19 's second goal hung over @entity34 until his death in 2000			1
but the saddest moment of his life , he said , was not in the final or its immediate aftermath			0
some 20 years later , a woman in a supermarket pointed towards him and declared to the young boy by her side , " look at him , son			0
he is the man that made all of @entity7 cry			2
" " under @entity102 law the maximum sentence is 30 years , " @entity34 remarked on his 79th birthday , just two weeks before he passed away			0
" but my imprisonment has been for 50 years			0
" the disappointment looms large in @entity7 's national psyche , and all the more so with the country to host the @entity6 again next year for the first time since that fateful day			1
" @entity108 , the playwright , spoke about ' our @entity109 , " @entity60 said			0
" it seems monstrously disproportionate and it is , but i think what he means is that it 's @entity7 's national disaster			2
" they 've never been in a war , they 've never really had a great disaster			0
they just expected to win			0
the newspapers on the morning of the game were saying ' @entity122			0
' " the newspapers were wrong			0
it is this weight which the present day team must carry as it prepares to host the @entity125 , a warmup event for the @entity6 , which @entity7 kicks off against @entity127 on saturday			1
once again the @entity6 is coming to @entity7 and once again a nation expects			1
" everybody knows the bad experiences we had in the @entity6 in @entity7 in the ' 50s -- we lost , but now we have to recover , " says @entity129 , one of football 's greatest players and a triple @entity6 winner with @entity7 between 1958 and 1970			1
@entity34 's tale is a cautionary one for the current @entity7 squad			1
a mistake by any player next year could be the costliest they ever make			0
@entity142 , coach of the last @entity7 team to lift the @entity6 in 2002 , was reinstated in november 2012 to inspire a floundering team			1
the results have been unspectacular			0
@entity142 has won two , drawn four and lost one of his seven matches back at the helm and the team languishes in 22nd in the @entity152 world rankings			2
a 2 - 2 draw with @entity154 in june was the first match at the refurbished @entity1 , a stadium which is both a monument to @entity7 's sporting prowess and a mausoleum for past failure			1
" we always have good players , but we do n't have a good team right now , " @entity160 , captain of @entity7 's @entity6 winners of 1970 , told @entity0			1
" we do n't have experience , the players are very young			0
" everybody says to these players , ' you have to win , you have to win			0
' it 's not good because they are young , they do n't have the experience to play an international tournament			0
" that 1970 team is often referred to as the greatest of all time , given the style and swagger with which it crushed @entity181 4 - 1 in the final match of the @entity184 tournament			1
the advent of color television made the players , bedecked in iconic vibrant yellow with green trim , appear as if soccer stars from another planet			0
@entity160 does not think the current generation is yet capable of emulating his team 's achievements , but he is backing his countrymen to succeed four years later			1
" they are going to take the experience of playing in the @entity6 next year into 2018			2
in @entity198 , i bet you any money @entity7 will win ! " he declared			2
" next year , if they get to the semifinals it is ok			0
" @entity205 , a midfielder capped 15 times for @entity7 between 2004 and 2005 , shares @entity160 's reservations			2
the former @entity209 player is concerned a change of management has disrupted a squad short on international experience			0
" we 're not prepared yet , " @entity205 , now director of football at @entity216 winners @entity215 , told @entity0			0
" we 've changed the coach , which is not normal			0
" usually a coach has four , five , six years to get used to his team			2
@entity142 is lucky , because @entity7 has a lot of players to build a good squad			2
but i 'm not sure if they will be prepared enough for the @entity6			2
" the @entity102 team is not in the best moment			0
" one player of whom a huge amount is expected is @entity232 , a flamboyant attacker recently signed by @entity233 who is frequently hailed as " the new @entity129			1
" if @entity7 is to finally win the @entity6 on home soil , the fleet - footed , shock - haired attacker will have to prove he has shoulders broad enough to carry a nation 's hopes			1
" listen , winning the @entity6 is very hard because it is a box of surprises			2
no doubt @entity7 is one of the best , but this does n't mean @entity7 is going to win ... the best players in @entity246 , they are @entity102 , " @entity129 told @entity0			2
" in @entity7 we have had a lot of excellent players like @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity129 , @entity252 , but the last two years we have had @entity232			1
" he is very talented			0
i hope he has luck in @entity233			0
i did n't like it so much because he used to play in my team , @entity256 , i lost a good player			2
he deserves to go to the best team			0
" i said to be the new @entity129 would be very difficult , because my mother and my father , they closed the machine ( gestures )			0
but no doubt he is one of the best players who we have in @entity7			2

@entity7 will host the football @entity6 for first time in *64* years in 2014
the @entity13 country lost to @entity19 in the final match of the 1950 tournament
flamboyant attacker @entity232 is the star of the current @entity7 team
