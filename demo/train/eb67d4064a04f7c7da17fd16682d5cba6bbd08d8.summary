-- there is something innately messy about summer			0
the air 's more pungent , bodies are stickier , and people seem more willing to make a mess			2
that must be why some of the world 's filthiest festivals bide their time until the warmer months			1
mud pack @entity13 , which culminated sunday , is the world 's biggest music festival			1
but it 's almost as renowned for its mud - splattered setting as it is the music -- indeed the festival is even credited with the invention of " mud surfing "			1
rain boots are de rigueur for the event 's 150,000 attendees , thanks in part to the @entity29 's typically soggy weather			1
this year was no different , with revelers arriving undeterred by the pouring rain			2
" sometimes , you 'll see a fairly innocuous - looking shortcut between some tents that no one else seems to be using , " recalls @entity32 , a @entity13 veteran			1
" you get halfway in only to discover it 's actually a three - foot - deep mud hole			1
i was stuck for 30 minutes before some kind soul decided to pull me free			0
" @entity41 : send us your best fireworks shots while celebrating muck is only incidental at @entity13 , at the @entity46 in @entity47 , sludge is the main event			1
the festival started in 1998 , when a local cosmetics company started making products using @entity53 mud -- which is highly regarded for its high mineral content			1
they launched the festival as a marketing initiative			2
it has since become one of the main events on the @entity47 calendar , with over 2.6 million visitors attending last year			2
this year , festivities start july 19			2
prospective attendees can expect the usual mix of messy attractions , namely , mud fights , mud slides , mud baths , mud wrestling and a mud marathon			2
food fights @entity73 is perhaps the most famous gastronomy - themed gathering , though the celebrated produce in question ( tomatoes ) gets thrown , not eaten			1
last year , 45,000 revelers joined the red riot in @entity80 , @entity81			2
though the event has become increasingly well - known , veterans say there 's no preparing for the juicy onslaught			1
" people start partying in the street and building themselves up into a frenzy			0
then the trucks roll out and a mass of red shoots into the air			0
next thing you know , you 're diving in there and face - washing strangers with tomatoes , " says @entity93 , a guide with @entity95 , which annually offers tours of the festival			1
over 150,000 tomatoes get chucked during @entity73 , and @entity93 says that a shower is n't always sufficient in washing away the remnants of the event			1
" the next day you 're finding tomatoes everywhere , and still cleaning stuff out of various parts			0
" this year 's event is slated for august 28 , though for the first time there will be a limit on the number of participants			1
only 20,000 will be allowed in , and those attending will need to procure tickets beforehand			1
still , there are several other , less - known festivals dedicated to the art of food - throwing			1
on june 29 , thousands of winos gather in @entity124 , @entity81 , a small town in the @entity127 region , to drench each other in reserve stocks of the area 's signature vino			0
the event is known as @entity133 , or the @entity134			0
according to the organizers , the festival dates back to the 13th century , and started as a land dispute that ended in some upended wine			0
to commemorate that first battle , attendees come armed with buckets , water pistols , wine skins , and various other receptacles to get things flowing			0
@entity146 has been organizing tours through @entity148 for four years			0
he notes that clean - up is n't always straight forward			0
" you smell like wine for days , " he says			0
any clothes you bring to the event will be stained eggplant by the end , so it 's best to consider anything worn on the day disposable			1
body of work sometimes , mess is merely the byproduct of a spectacular work of art. that 's doubly true when bodies are used in place of a canvas , as is the case at the @entity168 in @entity169 , @entity170			1
the event , which kicked off july 1 , started as a small gathering 16 years ago with 20 artists showcasing their work			1
today , 30,000 people attend yearly			0
festival organizer @entity176 says the artwork has become more sophisticated , pulling in professional makeup artists from around the world			1
models are n't merely painted ( often with a sponge of airbrush ) , but bedazzled , sculpted and adorned with elaborate headpieces			0
prosthetics are also commonly used in crafting the type of fantastical characters usually reserved for a sci - fi epic			0
one of @entity176 's favorite examples , she says , was when an artist painted three separate models and posed them to look like a motorcycle			2
" it was fascinating , because you could n't recognize where the people began and ended			0
all you saw was the motorcycle , " she recalls			0
several bands play throughout the festival , though the art is definitely the key component			2
@entity176 says she hopes the festival will help redefine how people view the practice			0
" we want people to understand that body painting is an art form			0
it 's not just about coloring in some bodies , " she says .			0

@entity13 , the world 's biggest music festival , is credited with inventing " mud surfing "
@entity73 is probably the best known food - themed gathering
this year , the event will be limited to 20,000 participants , with tickets on sale in advance
at the annual @entity168 in @entity170 , artists paint models to *resemble* works of art
