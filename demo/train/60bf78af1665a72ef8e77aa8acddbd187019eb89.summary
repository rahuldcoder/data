@entity0 -- when @entity3 rep. @entity3 and @entity5 sen. @entity4 held a news conference -- together -- to announce that they reached a deal on the federal budget , the ideological opposites received immediate praise for their cooperation			1
and they reached their agreement that would avert a potential government shutdown in january just two days before the congressionally imposed deadline for doing so			2
the proposal that was heading for final congressional approval in the @entity18 on wednesday is being held up for all to see as a rare illustration of bipartisanship in a deeply divided @entity0 that could lead to greater @entity22 comity			1
it 's " an important step in helping to heal some of the wounds here in @entity22 , " @entity23 said when she announced the agreement with @entity3			1
no - drama budget vote : how can this be ? while she suggested the act of working together has the potential to influence the mood in @entity22 to be more agreeable , the deal removes a significant obstacle that has led to legislative gridlock so far this decade			1
for the next two years , @entity22 has a binding restriction on the amount of money it can spend			1
the deal split the difference between the amount that @entity3 and @entity5 wanted to spend -- $ 1.012 trillion for 2014 and $ 1.014 trillion for 2015			1
" this means we can fund the operations of government through regular , annual appropriations bills , instead of through last - minute , stop - gap bills that put the government on autopilot , " said sen. @entity42 , who sits at the head of the @entity44			2
a big deal that 's a big deal			1
it 's the first time that a budget agreement has passed a divided @entity57 and the @entity18 since 1986 , according to senate majority leader @entity58			1
" gridlock has got to end and it is ending , " @entity58 told reporters			2
" it 's really a step forward			2
" but will it end gridlock ? " no , " @entity22 scholar @entity66 of the @entity67 said			1
" i do n't expect it to have any lasting consequences , " @entity66 said			2
the budget agreement only solves part of the problem			1
while it sets spending levels , it does n't actually allocate the money and does n't specify how the money can be spent			2
that battle will begin immediately			0
@entity44 members must agree before january 15 -- the deadline set by @entity22 in october for a new spending plan to be in place -- on how to divvy up the money			1
for instance , @entity3 will want more money for the military			0
democrats will want more money for @entity89 programs			0
" we may not even be through with this , " @entity66 said			0
and that 's not the only issue of contention to be worked out in january alone			0
extended unemployment insurance benefits are set to expire december 28 , which will leave 1.3 million people without benefits and hit another 800,000 in the coming weeks			0
despite the looming deadline , the issue was shelved in order to reach a budget deal			1
@entity58 vowed to address the issue immediately upon the @entity18 's return in january			0
republicans , however , are not keen on the extending the already expanded program			0
again ? before the budget deal even becomes law , signs of serious strife are already emerging around the debt ceiling , the nation 's borrowing limit , which is expected to be tapped in february			1
since 2010 , the debt limit has sparked partisan fights and near - government shutdowns as @entity3 want an increase in the debt ceiling tied to spending cuts			0
" i ca n't imagine the @entity3 want another fight on debt ceiling , " @entity58 told reporters tuesday			0
and the foundation is being laid for a major battle in the new year			1
" we do n't want nothing out of this debt limit , " @entity3 said sunday on @entity124			0
over in the @entity18 , the sentiment is similar			0
a top @entity3 indicated that he expects his caucus to push for concessions related to reducing government spending			0
" every time the president asks us to raise the debt ceiling is a good time to try to achieve something important for the country , " senate minority leader @entity132 said tuesday			0
an election year further complicating this so - called season of bipartisanship is that 2014 is an election year , historically a time when less gets accomplished in @entity22 as lawmakers become even more risk averse and spend even more time fund - raising and campaigning			1
lawmakers up for re-election are reluctant to take risky votes			0
and a decent indicator of how @entity22 deals with next year 's prickly battles is that all seven @entity3 senators facing primary challengers in 2014 were opponents of the budget deal			1
and in the @entity57 , where all members are up for reelection , primary challengers are also common , forcing lawmakers to appeal to party activists often by shunning compromise			0
and that is unlikely to subside			0
even though @entity57 speaker @entity166 surprisingly criticized conservative groups publicly last week , no one on @entity165 expects the @entity168 @entity3 to become the champion of bipartisanship			2
to be determined a host of issues still need to be worked out , including the @entity173 , which affects the price consumers pay for groceries , payments to doctors who see @entity179 patients , and immigration			2
and even the budget deal were to be reworked post-passage			1
some lawmakers , including @entity184 @entity183 sen. @entity183 , vow to reverse a provision that reduces retirement benefits for military families			0
@entity66 said the budget deal is a singular instance of cooperation because it played into both parties best interests			1
both parties avoided being labeled obstructionists and extremists			0
" this is n't about good feelings among members but strategic behavior by two parties , " @entity66 said			0
bipartisanship is , ultimately , a partisan play			2
military retirees ' screwed ' in budget deal @entity1 's @entity205 and @entity206 contributed to this report			1

bipartisan budget deal first to pass divided @entity22 since 1986
it could pave the way for future bipartisanship
but contentious issues and an election year could hamper progress
