@entity1 commenters are not known for keeping their opinions to themselves			1
angry users of the @entity5 - owned video site are revolting online against @entity1 's new commenting system , which requires everyone to connect their current account to a @entity10 account in order to leave a comment on a video			1
the system was announced in september and fully rolled out on tuesday			1
more than 30,000 people have left comments on the original @entity1 blog post announcing the switch			1
most are angry complaints and , in classic @entity1 form , include obscenities , fights and @entity24 drawings of phalluses			2
there are also multiple @entity28 petitions asking @entity1 to revert to the old commenting system			1
the most popular petition has more than 50,000 supporters and it was the most active petition on the @entity28 site friday			2
" comments were the no. 1 reason why i checked my @entity1 account daily			1
now that desire is gone , " says the top comment on the petition , left by someone calling themselves @entity41			0
the biggest issue with the change is that @entity10 encourages people to use their real names , and some @entity1 commenters prefer being anonymous			1
" making it incredibly difficult to have a username other than my actual name , and being forced to display it to the world is also a huge problem i have with this new setup , " said @entity48 on another @entity28 petition on the subject			2
there are a dozen petitions on the topic			0
another , called " @entity1 and @entity5 , bring back the @entity63 and @entity10 on those that do n't want it , " has more than 16,000 signatures			1
there 's even one petition asking @entity1 to keep the changes , but only 10 people have supported it so far			2
intriguingly , @entity28 says the biggest source of traffic for these petitions is @entity10			1
anonymous commenters are n't the only people who are upset			0
the co-founder of @entity1 , @entity77 has even chimed in after eight years of silence on the site just to comment on the change			1
" why the f * * * do i need a google+ account to comment on a video ? " he said in a comment on his channel			0
@entity77 uploaded the very first video to @entity1 in 2005 , a clip of himself at the zoo , and has n't posted there again until now			0
the move to the new commenting system is part of the ongoing push by @entity5 to make @entity10 the underlying identity platform for all its products			1
but the overhauled system is also an attempt to pull the notoriously rough and troll - filled @entity1 comments out of the gutter			1
in the new system , content creators will have more control when it comes to monitoring the comments on their videos			0
they can block certain users and make a list of banned words			0
there are threaded conversations and @entity10 will filter and order comments so people see content relevant to their friend groups and interests			2
in theory , negative comments will be pushed to the bottom of threads and quality conversations will surface at the top			0
the biggest complaint commenters have is that @entity10 strips them of anonymity			2
when the identity platform first rolled out , @entity10 required people to use their real names , but it has since loosened those rules			2
when @entity1 announced the @entity10 integration , @entity1 product manager @entity129 said users would never be forced to use their real names			1
when people link their accounts , they can choose to display their nickname or channel name instead of their full name			0
the people fighting against @entity10 accounts seem to be the minority			0
eighty percent of @entity1 commenters had already connected to a @entity10 account before the update took effect			1
there are no exact numbers on how many active @entity1 commenters there are , but millions of comments are left throughout the site daily			1
many people just do n't like it when their favorite products change			0
online backlash is common with any major update or redesign on a tech site			0
when @entity1 rolled out a new channel design earlier this year , a @entity28 petition asking the site to revert back to the original design got more than 30,000 supporters			1
" we are utterly horrified at the new layout and i truly hope @entity1 will hear the cries of the loyal users , " read the petition			0
@entity1 kept the new design and it seems to have been largely forgotten about			0
sometimes online outrage can push a company to change			0
@entity170 added an abuse button and @entity172 rolled back online payment fees after online feedback and petitions			0
games are a particularly popular target for online petitions , with users asking for and frequently getting changes to their favorite games or systems			0
@entity1 has dealt with these types of mini-uprisingings before			0
@entity1 is the fourth most petitioned company on @entity28 , after @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187			1
in this case , the company , which is used to angry commenters , seems unlikely to revert to the old system .			2

some @entity1 commenters are angry with the new @entity10 commenting system
the updated comments rolled out tuesday , require everyone to connect to a @entity10 account
there are multiple @entity28 petitions ; a @entity1 co-founder has complained on the site
