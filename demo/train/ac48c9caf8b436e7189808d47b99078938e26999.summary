@entity0 is famous for its singular residents : loudmouthed taxi drivers			1
@entity5 patrons of the arts			0
now , the city is welcoming an unlikely new breed of denizen : a newly discovered species of frog			2
a team of scientists has identified the unique critter , dubbed the @entity17 leopard frog , in the marshes of @entity19 -- beside @entity20 and not far from the @entity21			1
the frog 's habitat stretches from @entity24 to @entity25 , but it 's the discovery of an exotic animal species in one of the world 's most densely populated urban areas that has scientists buzzing			2
" it is incredible and exciting that a new species of frog could be hiding in plain sight in @entity0 , " said @entity32 , a biology professor at @entity33 and a co-author of a research paper about the frog , published this week in the scientific journal @entity42			1
the finding confirms research done more than 75 years ago by @entity45 , former director of the @entity46 , who wrote many books about amphibians and was considered an authority on the subject			1
@entity45 published a paper in 1937 in which he claimed to have discovered the new frog species , but his research was dismissed for lack of evidence			1
@entity45 died in 1974 at age 63			0
his cause was taken up six years ago by @entity33 doctoral candidate @entity59 , lead author of the new paper			1
@entity59 and other researchers said they were able to employ modern technology to examine the genetics and mating calls of leopard frogs and determine that the amphibians in the wetlands of @entity19 were in fact distinct from two closely related other species inhabiting the northeast @entity70 " we had the benefits of genetic testing and bioacoustic analysis that simply were n't available to @entity75 to prove that even though this frog might look like the two other leopard frogs in the area , it was actually a third and completely separate species , " @entity59 said			1
in giving the scientific name @entity81 to the new frog , @entity59 and a team of seven other researchers chose to honor @entity45 and his work			2
" after some discussion , we agreed that it just seemed right to name the species after @entity45 , " @entity59 said			0
" we wanted to acknowledge his work and give credit where we believe it was due , even though it was nearly 80 years after the fact			0
" despite its trademark urban canyons of steel , glass and concrete , @entity0 actually is home to a wide variety of animal life			0
the 843 acres of @entity101 , for example , contain raccoons and opossums , many types of migratory birds and a rare species of centipede			0
and , of course , lots and lots of pigeons			0
no word on whether the @entity19 frog ever swims across the harbor to @entity115 for a little sightseeing			2
but given the public fascination with the @entity120 cobra that briefly escaped its enclosure in 2011 , it may be only a matter of time before the new frog gets its own @entity125 account .			0

a new frog species is discovered in @entity0 , of all places
researchers encountered the frogs living in the marshes of @entity19
the finding confirms research done more than 75 years ago
