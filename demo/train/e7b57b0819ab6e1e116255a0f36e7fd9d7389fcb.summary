-- a woman facing possible stoning and one of her lawyers argue that @entity5 is mischaracterizing the status of adultery and murder charges against her			1
@entity9 and attorney @entity10 say even though @entity9 was cleared of her husband 's murder five years ago , @entity5 continues to insist she was found guilty			1
" they 're lying , " @entity9 told the @entity14 newspaper through an intermediary friday			2
" they are embarrassed by the international attention on my case and they are desperately trying to distract attention and confuse the media so that they can kill me in secret			0
" @entity5 suspended the death by stoning after there was international outcry over the sentence , but may reinstate it in coming days			1
" i was found guilty of adultery [ in 2006 ] and was acquitted of murder , but the man who actually killed my husband was identified and imprisoned but he is not sentenced to death , " @entity9 said			1
she insists @entity5 wants her stoned because she is a woman			2
in a letter written to the @entity35 against @entity36 and sent saturday to @entity0 , @entity10 argued the @entity5 judicial system has mishandled @entity9 's case			1
" if murder was proven , my client would have been executed and there would have been no need to stone her to death , " @entity10 wrote			2
" based on @entity48 , the punishments for murder and adultery should have been combined in one case and sentence and handled by @entity51 of the @entity52			0
whereas this was not the case			0
the branch has no records of sentencing my client to murder			0
" last month , @entity58 , who is the head of the judiciary of @entity61 , said @entity9 's crimes were " numerous " and said she was " convicted of adultery and murder and was sentenced to death , " according to the official news agency @entity66			1
" because of morality and ethics , i can not go into the details of the crimes , but if the public knew , they would understand the criminal nature of them , " he said , according to @entity66			0
" but she killed her husband , brutally and gruesomely , and the detective on the scene said that if she had beheaded her husband it would have been better than what they actually saw			0
" @entity9 , 43 , a mother of two , is being held in a @entity83 prison			0
@entity5 's judiciary could reinstate her sentence of death by stoning , execute her by other means , or possibly even grant her a reprieve , according to human rights groups			1
@entity92 , spokeswoman for the @entity35 against @entity36 , said if @entity9 is executed , " it is entirely political			2
it has nothing to do with the case itself			0
" " now that @entity5 is under this international pressure , they have brought the case up that convicts her of the murder of her husband , " @entity92 said saturday			1
@entity10 's letter said the man actually convicted in the death of @entity9 's husband , " admitted in the branch that he administered the electrifying of mr. [ @entity106 ] ghaderzadeh himself with his own hands three times and each time the deceased received electrical shock			1
" the lawyer also challenged the adultery conviction			0
