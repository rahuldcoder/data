@entity1 hammered home a cross from @entity10 in the 109th minute to settle the clash and leave @entity12 's @entity6 heartbroken at @entity14 's @entity13			1
the @entity6 had twice gone close with @entity16 's @entity15 having an effort cleared off the line and winger @entity19 firing straight at goalkeeper @entity20 when clean through on goal			1

" the triumph secures @entity4 an automatic place at the @entity46 in @entity47 -- a warm - up for the @entity49 proper a year later			1
@entity6 had only conceded once in the competition before the final and goalkeeper @entity52 , who became his country 's most capped player with his 88th appearance , easily dealt with @entity57 's effort in the first half			2
it was @entity12 's side , appearing in only their second @entity7 , who looked the more dangerous and they struck the woodwork early in the second half through @entity65 's cross that became a shot			2
@entity4 hit back when the lively @entity67 provided a delivery for @entity69 , whose header drifted narrowly wide of the post			0
with 20 minutes left @entity19 spurned his chance when one - on - one with @entity20 and as the game drifted towards extra-time , @entity4 started to take control			1
after 109 goalless minutes and with the match headed for penalties , @entity1 fired the telling blow to spark scenes of wild celebration on the @entity4 bench			1
by contrast , @entity6 's @entity83 coach @entity12 was left to rue earlier missed chances			2

unfortunately , we could n't convert them , " he told @entity28 .			0
