" for the record , i 've always really loved @entity2			1
" so says @entity3 , who recently protested the social photo sharing site by walking topless through the streets of @entity7 and posting the photographs on @entity9			1
@entity10 , the 22 - year - old daughter of actors @entity10 and @entity13 , wrote about her reasoning for her naked uprising for @entity16			1
@entity10 explained that " @entity2 had recently deleted my account over what they called ' instances of abuse			1
' which in reality amounted to a photo of myself in a sheer top and a post of a jacket i made featuring a picture of two close friends topless			2
" " my situation was in no way unique ; women are regularly kicked off @entity2 for posting photos with any portion of the areola exposed , while photos sans nipple -- degrading as they might be -- remain unchallenged , " @entity10 wrote			1
" so i walked around @entity7 topless and documented it on @entity9 , pointing out that what is legal by @entity41 state law is not allowed on @entity2			1
" it is not illegal in @entity7 for a woman to be topless in public as long as she is otherwise law abiding			1
the young actress wrote that she understands that many " do n't want to take me seriously			0
" " or would rather just write me off as an attention - seeking , overprivileged , ignorant , white girl , " she said			0
" i am white and i was born to a high profile and financially privileged family			0
i did n't choose my public life , but it did give me this platform			0
a platform that helps make body politics newsworthy			0
" the discussion is worth it to @entity10 , who points out that the @entity59 campaign has been around for a few years fighting to do away with the " taboo of the nipple in the 21st century			2
" she said she 's happy to have furthered the discussion			0
" i am not trying to argue for mandatory toplessness , or even bralessness , " @entity10 wrote			2
" what i am arguing for is a woman 's right to choose how she represents her body -- and to make that choice based on personal desire and not a fear of how people will react to her or how society will judge her			0
no woman should be made to feel ashamed of her body			0

@entity3 , the daughter of @entity10 and @entity13 , says she loved @entity2
she walked topless in @entity7 to protest the websites policy on breast photos
her goal is that women should not be ashamed of their bodies
