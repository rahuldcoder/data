in at least one big and bruising culture - war battle , the @entity1 church wants to call a partial truce			2
convening a rare press conference on tuesday at church headquarters in @entity9 , @entity1 leaders pledged to support anti-discrimination laws for gays , lesbians , bisexuals and transgender people , as long the laws also protect the rights of religious groups			1
in exchange , the @entity1 church wants gay rights advocates -- and the government -- to back off			2
" when religious people are publicly intimidated , retaliated against , forced from employment or made to suffer personal loss because they have raised their voice in the public square , donated to a cause or participated in an election , our democracy is the loser , " said @entity21 , a member of the church 's @entity22			1
" such tactics are every bit as wrong as denying access to employment , housing or public services because of race or gender			0
" the @entity1 church is one of several faiths to complain about religious freedom coming under attack in recent years			2
catholic bishops and @entity47 have sounded the alarm as well			0
@entity49 cited several examples on tuesday , including : " it is one of today 's great ironies that some people who have fought so hard for lgbt rights now try to deny the rights of others to disagree with their public policy proposals , " said @entity49			1
tuesday 's announcement does n't change church doctrine -- including its opposition to gay marriage , @entity1 leaders said			2
" but we are suggesting a way forward in which those with different views on these complex issues can together seek solutions that will be fair to everyone , " said @entity63 , a member of the @entity22 , one of the church 's top tiers of leadership			0
@entity63 said tuesday 's announcement came after years of dialogue with @entity76 groups in @entity77 and elsewhere , and was timed to the convening of a new @entity79 and new legislative sessions nationwide			2
" it seemed like the right time to speak , before positions get any more hardened on either side , " he said			0
shortly after the church 's press conference , @entity86 sen. @entity85 , a @entity77 @entity87 and a @entity1 , said he will work to " ensure that legislation designed to promote greater equality includes robust religious exemptions and nonretaliation provisions			1
" @entity77 state sen. @entity94 , who is openly gay , said " @entity97 , " to the church 's " historic announcement			0
" " i am proud that the @entity98 has seen fit to lead the way in non-discrimination , " he said			0
" now , let 's roll up our sleeves , get to work and pass a statewide nondiscrimination bill			0
" oaks , however , said it 's " unfair " to characterize the church 's announcement as a national nondiscrimination campaign			0
mormon leaders are merely seeking to square competing claims of gay rights and religious liberty , he said in a brief interview on tuesday			1
the @entity117 , a national @entity76 advocacy group , said some @entity1 may consider their church 's announcement symbolically significant			0
" but , as a matter of public policy , it appears deeply flawed , " said @entity117 legal director @entity119			0
doctors , landlords and business owners would still be allowed to discriminate against gays and lesbians , as long as they cited a religious reason , she said			1
on the other end of the spectrum , @entity130 leader @entity129 called the @entity1 ' new policy " well - intentioned , but naive			0
" proposals to balance gay rights and religious freedom inevitably lead to attacks on the latter , @entity129 said			1
officially known as the @entity98 , the @entity1 church , like other religious groups , has tried to strike a delicate balance on gay rights			1
@entity1 have fought the legalization of same - sex marriage , for example , while trying to avoid the " anti-gay " label sometimes affixed to conservative faiths			0
many church members were particularly stung by the fierce backlash to @entity149			0
the @entity1 - backed referendum was later struck down in court			0
nearly two - thirds of @entity1 say homosexuality should be discouraged by society , according to a 2012 survey conducted by the @entity156			0
the church 's official position is that same - sex attraction is not a sin , but acting on it is			0
at the same time , @entity1 leaders have taken an increasingly civil tone towards gays and lesbians in recent years , and gay rights groups cheered the church for endorsing the @entity169 ' decision to allow gay scouts in 2013			1
notably , however , @entity1 leaders said tuesday that they would not -- and could not -- alter their opposition to gay marriage , calling such unions , " contrary to the laws of @entity175			1
" " this commandment and doctrine comes from sacred scripture and we are not at liberty to change it , " said @entity176 , a leader in the church 's women 's organization			0
" but , @entity175 is loving and merciful , " @entity176 continued			0
@entity185 ministered to marginalized outcasts , she said by way of example , while also obeying religious commandments			2
" it 's for this reason that the church has publicly favored laws and ordinances that protect @entity76 people from discrimination in housing and employment			1
" in 2009 , the @entity1 church backed nondiscrimination regulations for gays and lesbians in @entity9			1
on tuesday , @entity1 leaders said they are now willing to support similar measures elsewhere , including laws protecting @entity76 persons from unfair bias in housing , unemployment and public transportation			1
with nearly 6.5 million members in the @entity86 , the @entity1 church is one of the largest in this country to offer support of @entity76 anti-discrimination laws , second only to the @entity215			1
the country 's two largest christian denominations , the @entity216 and @entity47 , have opposed the @entity218 , or @entity219			0
none of those groups condone gay marriage			2
in this country , less than a third of states have laws protecting gays and lesbians from discrimination , according to @entity230 , a gay rights group			1
even fewer state laws protect gender identity or expression			1
it is unlikely that @entity1 ' support of those measures could increase that number significantly , except perhaps in church strongholds like @entity77 , @entity239 and @entity240			2
there are 16 mormons in @entity79 , where @entity76 civil rights legislation , including @entity219 , has repeatedly failed			2
gay marriage has proved far more successful than anti-discrimination laws , despite opposition from conservative groups , including the @entity1 church			1
thirty - five states now allow same - sex couples to wed. earlier this month , the @entity248 agreed to decide whether states have the constitutional right to ban same - sex marriage			0
perhaps with an eye on the high court , @entity1 leaders said tuesday the rights of gays and lesbians must not trump the religious freedom of faith communities			1
" what kinds of religious rights are we talking about ? " said @entity260 , a member of the church 's @entity22			1
it begins with the rights of faith communities to preach their beliefs from the pulpit , teach them in church classrooms and freely select their own leaders and ministers , @entity260 said			1
but religious freedom should also extend to @entity1 physicians who refuse to perform abortions or artificial insemination for a lesbian couple , or a @entity216 pharmacist who declines to carry the " morning after " pill , he added			2
as @entity1 leaders acknowledged tuesday , such situations have perplexed politicians , appeared on court dockets across the country and set conservative and liberals at fierce odds			2
" these are serious issues , " @entity260 said , " and they require serious minds engaged in thoughtful , courteous discourse			0
