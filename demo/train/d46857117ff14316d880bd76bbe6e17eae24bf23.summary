the world 's response to @entity2 is its own sort of tragedy			1
two facts make the point clear : -- the @entity7 has asked for $ 1 billion to fight the spread of the virus			2
as of friday , it had collected only $ 100,000 -- or 0.01 %			2
an additional $ 20 million has been pledged but not received , according to @entity11			2
" we need to turn pledges into action , " the @entity7 's @entity12 told reporters			1
" we need more doctors , nurses , equipment , treatment centers			2
" -- @entity21 , meanwhile , which is hardest hit by the virus , says it requires 2.4 million boxes of protective gloves -- and 85,000 body bags , to be able to fight the virus in the next six months			1
currently , it only has 18,000 boxes of gloves and less than 5,000 body bags			0
let that second number sink in			0
eight - five thousand body bags needed			0
but what is actually - really - truly behind the lack of helpfulness on the part of the international community ? if you listen to right - wing pundits in the @entity41 , we should blame @entity42 -- who they say is having his " @entity45 moment			0
" those jabs are fueled more by upcoming midterm elections than reality			0
and they wo n't likely be quieted by @entity42 's announcement on friday that he has appointed an " ebola czar " to manage the @entity41 response			1
the true devastation , however , has been unfolding in @entity54 for months			0
and it 's the subject of far less outrage in the @entity41			1
a more rational and deep - seated critique of the international community 's relative inaction emerged in a recent @entity61 interview with @entity62 , the former @entity7 secretary general , who is from @entity63			1
" if the crisis had hit some other region , " he 's quoted as telling that news organization , " it probably would have been handled very differently			1
" in fact when you look at the evolution of the crisis , the international community really woke up when the disease got to @entity75 and @entity76			0
" it 's hard not to agree that race and geography do play a role in the world 's callousness			1
they help explain why " some other region " -- any other region , really -- would get more help			1
science tells part of the story			0
there 's evidence lighter skinned people have trouble " feeling " the pain of those with darker skin			1
researchers at the @entity96 , in @entity97 , tested this in by showing a group of @entity101 people video clips of people of various races being pricked with a needle			0
they monitored the viewers to see how their bodies responded to the sight of another person being hurt			0
the white viewers reacted more strongly -- or showed more physical empathy -- when white people were hurt than @entity113			0
in another study , " researchers found that white participants , black participants , and nurses and nursing students assumed that blacks felt less pain than whites , " @entity114 writes			1
except for a handful of health workers , nearly all of @entity2 's 4,400 casualties have been black @entity113 -- and these simmering biases are deeply troubling			1
" @entity2 is now a stand - in for any combination of ' african - ness ' , ' blackness ' , ' foreign - ness ' and ' infestation ' -- poised to ruin the perceived purity of @entity138 borders and bodies , " @entity129 wrote for @entity130			1
there 's a long , ugly history of this sort of thing			1
consider the 1994 @entity145 genocide , or the @entity146			0
" in the case of @entity153 , it took years for proper research funding to be put in place and it was only when so - called ' innocent ' groups were involved ( women and children , haemophiliac patients and straight men ) that the media , the politicians and the scientific community and funding bodies took notice , " @entity147 , president of the @entity149 @entity148 , wrote for @entity150			0
the headline of his piece : " they 'd find a cure if @entity2 came to @entity171			1
" maybe some blame should fall on geography , as well			2
@entity41 , in particular , know very little about @entity54 ( just try this quiz on @entity113 geography from the @entity176 )			2
the physical distance between @entity54 and @entity75 or @entity76 -- two global centers of financial and political power -- also could lead people to feel emotionally distant from the crisis			0
" i do n't know about racism , but i do know when ( @entity2 ) was only in @entity54 , hardly anyone in the @entity41 cared that it was killing thousands , " a friend wrote in response to a question i posed on @entity186			1
" but now that like four people have it in the @entity41 , it is all - out panic			0
" whatever the reason , a lack of empathy is clearly at play			2
too many people panic when @entity2 hits @entity200 but shrug at the gruesome reality in @entity203			1
too many worry that someone who might have been in contact with an @entity2 patient has boarded a cruise ship bound for @entity209 -- but we do n't feel for @entity2 's child orphans			1
i hope shining light on these realities can help change them			0
i 'll leave you with a passage from an essay by @entity218 , a woman who worked as a " medical actor , " meaning she faked illnesses for emotionally tone - deaf medical students			0
as she listened to the sometimes hard - headed students interrogate her about her made - up illnesses , she learned a thing or two about what it means to actually empathize with a person			0
" @entity229 is n't just something that happens to us -- a meteor shower of synapses firing across the brain -- it 's also a choice we make : to pay attention , to extend ourselves , " she wrote			2
take that as a challenge			0
and demand world leaders do the same .			2

the world 's response to @entity2 is its own tragedy , writes @entity246 's @entity245
he argues race and geography play a role in the inaction
@entity62 : if @entity2 hit another region , " it probably would have been handled very differently "
