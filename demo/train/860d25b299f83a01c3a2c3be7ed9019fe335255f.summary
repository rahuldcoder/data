@entity0 is undeniably becoming a strategic platform to address the @entity4 continent			2
an increasing number of global companies choose to step in , first in @entity0 , to then gain a faster access to other @entity4 markets			2
its geographic proximity to @entity11 , its political stability and its competitive workforce constitute a powerful advantage			1
this is especially true for the aeronautics sub-contracting market			0
however , the country has still a long way to go to be among the top performers in this sector			2
the @entity0 aeronautics sector is enjoying an annual growth rate of 15 % to 20 % ( with a slight softening to 13.8 % in 2013 according to the @entity24 )			1
today , over 100 companies in the aeronautical sector are based there , employing over 8,000 people in total			0
this market is generating a turnover of around 800 million euros which represents 5 % of @entity0 's total exports , and the industry is one of the top priority sectors in @entity0 's industrial " emergence plan			1
" factories are expanding and companies are recruiting to support their growth			1
according to the @entity42 and @entity43 , the sector is likely to double in size by 2020			0
nevertheless , in order to become a heavyweight player in the sub-contracting market , @entity0 will need to manufacture more complex components and improve its training programs to meet the needs of global aircraft manufacturers			2
indeed , several countries are competing in the sub-contracting market such as @entity54 , @entity55 or @entity56			0
even though the @entity0 aerospace and defense sector was in the worldwide top 8 recipients of inward investment between 2001 and 2011 , some of its competitor countries offer lower - priced labor			1
consequently , @entity0 has to counterbalance by producing more complex parts and by improving the efficiency of its local supply chain ( i.e. licensing local distributors )			0
to become a key player and to attract global manufacturers , a significant pool of high - skilled personnel is required			0
the estimate is that 20,000 people will be needed by 2020 in this industry			0
this applies mostly to machinists and technicians levels , since there are already enough @entity0 engineers specialized in aeronautics			2
the @entity83 and the @entity84 were hence established to quickly redirect and complement @entity0 's public sector educational system which was not taking aeronautics as a priority			1
since then , more than 1,500 people have graduated from these institutes but aeronautics manufacturers still have to train young machinists in - house for an average of two years before they are completely up to speed			0
another influential factor for @entity0 's aeronautics industry future is @entity99 's on - going establishment in the country scheduled to open at the end of this year ; first plant on the @entity4 continent enabling the company to sell several of its aircrafts , well suited for the continent needs			1
this location choice is not random , but largely due to @entity0 incentives and tax benefits ( not revealed but said to be close to $ 20 million )			2
this calculated move by the @entity0 authorities will have a big impact on the aeronautics industry and provide multiple business opportunities in this sector , especially for sub-contractors			1
the government also created a free zone for aeronautics companies close to @entity121 's airport			0
the @entity123 company @entity122 has already chosen to set up there and will benefit from vat and corporate tax exemption among other incentives			0
in 2012 , @entity0 's aeronautics exports exceeded its imports for the first time			1
the country has already achieved to attract several major global players but it seems that they are not yet planning to produce entire airplanes in the country			0
@entity0 needs to overcome its training challenge and create more added - value to be able to succeed in the aeronautics sector			1
if it does , @entity0 will have put @entity4 on the map of the aeronautics sector			1

@entity0 's aeronautics sector benefits from the country 's location , political stability and competitive workforce
the industry is growing fast and factories are expanding to support that growth
@entity0 needs though to overcome training challenges and create more added - value to succeed in the sector
