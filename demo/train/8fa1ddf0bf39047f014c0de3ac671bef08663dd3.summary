-- every year there is talk of how the @entity4 trophy will find itself lured back to @entity5 for " @entity6 " -- or the tenth as @entity5 refers to it			1
that could very well be the case this season -- but perhaps it will reside at @entity13 for the very first time and in the hands of @entity16 , the manager of @entity17			1
on wednesday , his side produced a fine display to clinch its place in the semifinals of the @entity4 and in doing so ended @entity23 's hopes in the competition			1
an early goal by talented playmaker @entity26 ensured @entity17 recorded a 1 - 0 victory -- a result which gave the home side a 2 - 1 aggregate victory			1
@entity17 , which was held to a 1 - 1 draw at @entity33 in the first leg , should have had the game wrapped up by the interval after hitting the woodwork three times in the opening 20 minutes			1
despite missing top scorer @entity40 through injury , @entity17 continued to look the more dangerous			1
midfielder @entity42 then missed a glorious opportunity in the second half to kill off any hopes of a @entity23 comeback but failed to score when in on goal			1
@entity23 's best opportunity came through midfielder @entity49 but he failed to convert a rare chance in front of goal			1
while @entity23 has won the competition four times , @entity17 has never managed to claim @entity56 's biggest prize -- losing out in its only appearance in the final to @entity59 in 1974			1
now it has the opportunity to win not just @entity61 , where it sits top with six games to go , but also the @entity4			1
" it was a very important goal because it got us through to the semi-finals , " @entity26 told @entity66 broadcaster @entity64			0
" the work of the team across both legs has been spectacular			0
" we ran a huge amount , we played the two games in the way we wanted and i think we were the clear winners			0
" with these fans behind us it is very hard for us to lose a match here			0
" @entity23 , which faces @entity5 in the @entity81 final on april 16 , failed to impress despite the presence of @entity83 and @entity84 in attack			1
@entity87 's side will now switch its focus to the league title race with @entity5 and @entity17 also in contention			2
" we had the game within our grasp , " @entity23 midfielder @entity49 said			2
" we had four or five very clear chances that normally we would put away			0
" they made the most of those first 15 to 20 minutes when they played with a lot of intensity and scored the goal , " @entity49 told @entity64			0
" i think after that we stepped up to the challenge and deserved at least a draw			0
" i think we played two good games and had our chances in both legs but it slipped through our fingers			0
" we can only congratulate all the @entity17 fans			2
" the two teams will meet again on the final day of the league season at @entity33 -- a match which could be spectacular if this fixture is anything to go by			0
@entity59 cruise in the night 's other game , @entity59 survived a scare against @entity116 to book its place in the semifinals			1
the defending champion overcame its @entity121 opposition 3 - 1 on the night , 4 - 2 on aggregate following an entertaining second half			1
@entity125 's fierce effort gave @entity116 a shock lead after 57 minutes but goals from @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 sealed the win			2
there were few who gave united any chance whatsoever of making it through to the semifinals of the competition given its horrendous season in the @entity139			0
last season , under @entity140 , @entity116 won the league title by 11 points -- this year it sits seventh and faces a struggle to even claim a place in the @entity146			2
thrashed at home by rivals @entity149 and @entity150 , @entity116 performed admirably to record a 1 - 1 draw in the first leg against a rampant @entity59 side			1
the @entity155 giant swept all before it last season -- winning the domestic double as well as the @entity4 under @entity158			2
@entity159 , who won the competition with @entity23 in 2009 and 2011 , has already wrapped up the league title after his side stormed past its rivals			2
its first defeat in 54 league games came against @entity167 on saturday -- although @entity159 had taken the opportunity to rest players ahead of the @entity116 game			2
@entity59 , without suspended duo of @entity172 and @entity173 , enjoyed plenty of possession in the opening 45 minutes but failed to make any clear cut chances			2
winger @entity130 flashed an effort wide of the post , while @entity116 's best effort was ruled out for offside after @entity182 had netted from close - range			1
while the first half may have been a rather dour affair , the second was a rollercoaster of emotion as both sides began throwing men forward in search of victory			0
and it was @entity116 which struck first with 57 minutes played when @entity125 fired home an unstoppable effort from 20 - yards into the top corner of @entity198 's goal			1
that strike was wildy celebrated by players on the visiting bench but before they could even sit down , @entity59 was level thanks to a fine header by @entity128			2
buoyed by the equalizer , @entity59 bean to scent victory and @entity129 tapped home a second after beating @entity209 to @entity130 's cross			0
@entity130 added a third after leading the @entity116 defense a merry dance to round off the scoring and book @entity59 's place in the semifinal for the third time in four years			1
" they scored the first goal so it was a tricky tie but in the end 3 - 1 was a very good result , " the @entity217 told @entity218			1
" it was important to score straight after they made it 1 - 0			1
it was a wake - up call because the first 10 minutes in the second half were a disaster - we were slow and were not there			0
" you ca n't do that in the @entity4			0
after that we scored three goals			0
we wanted to attack and they were playing on the counter so you have to be careful			0
" the defeat means @entity116 will not compete in @entity56 's top competition next season and heaps more pressure on manager @entity241			0
midfielder @entity242 says the absence of @entity4 football at @entity245 will be difficult to swallow			0
" it was always going to be tough tonight and we 're not in the @entity4 next season , not necessarily because of tonight , but because we have been weak and have n't been good enough over the season , " he told @entity218			0
" we need to finish the season as best we can and get ready for next season and come back believing we can win the title and qualify for the @entity4 next season			0
