@entity0 -- eight current and former @entity3 service members filed a lawsuit tuesday alleging they were raped , sexually assaulted or harassed while serving in the military and were retaliated against once they reported the abuse			1
among the defendants named in the suit are current and former defense and @entity11 secretaries and @entity13 commandants			1
" although defendants testified before @entity15 and elsewhere that they have ' zero tolerance ' for rape and sexual assault , their conduct and the facts demonstrate the opposite : they have a high tolerance for sexual predators in their ranks , and ' zero tolerance ' for those who report rape , sexual assault and harassment , " according to the lawsuit filed in the @entity30 in @entity0			1
the suit outlines a pattern of abuse and portrays , in grim detail , the alleged experiences of the eight female service members -- two former @entity13 officers , one active duty enlisted @entity13 , one former enlisted member of the @entity13 and four former enlisted members of the @entity11			1
" at first it was easy to laugh it off , " plaintiff @entity39 , one of the former officers , said about her superiors ' advances			1
" when you finally said , you know , i 'm really not interested , i 'd rather we be friends -- that 's when you became the target			1
they hated you for standing up for yourself , " she told @entity52 's @entity51 on tuesday night			1
the lawsuit alleges @entity55 was raped by her superior at his office in march 2006 after a required pub crawl			2
she told reporters at the @entity59 in @entity0 earlier in the day that she hoped by going public other victims would be encouraged to speak out			2
" it 's the first time i 've had a voice in six years , so pardon if it 's a little wobbly , " said @entity55			2
she was joined by @entity64 , another @entity65 officer and plaintiff , who served in @entity67 in 2008 and 2009			1
opinion : victims of military sex assaults deserve justice in august 2010 , @entity72 was " gang - raped " by a senior officer and his civilian friend at her @entity0 home , the suit contends			1
the officer allegedly threatened to kill @entity72			2
she reported the rapes and the officer was eventually convicted in a military court of adultery and indecent language , and given 45 days in military confinement , @entity72 said			2
" their stance was there were two that said it ( sex ) was consensual , despite the death threat			2
that 's two against one			0
so by that logic , the more people you 're gang - raped by the less your case is , " she told @entity51			0
the @entity13 responded to @entity72 and @entity55 's allegations in a written statement tuesday that said their respective cases had been properly investigated and handled			0
" federal law and judicial rulings require commanders in all services , including the @entity13 , to balance needs of alleged victims with the constitutional rights of service members accused of crimes , " it read			0
according to the most recent @entity113 study , more than 19,000 incidents of unwanted sexual contact are estimated to have occurred in 2010 , though less than 3,000 of those events were reported			0
in 2010 , less than 21 % of reported cases went to trial			0
of the 529 alleged perpetrators who were prosecuted , 53 % were convicted , according to the 2011 @entity118 , which is part of the @entity113			0
" as leaders of this department we are committed to doing everything we can to ensure the safety , dignity and well being of our people			0
one sexual assault is one too many , " @entity113 spokeswoman @entity127 said in response to the lawsuit			0
as a result of the pending litigation , she was unable to comment directly on the allegations			0
" because sexual assault cases are some of the toughest cases to investigate and prosecute , the department has increased funding for investigators and judge advocates to receive specialized training , " said @entity127			0
the lawsuit was filed less than two months after defense secretary @entity142 outlined new measures targeting sexual assaults against @entity3 military personnel			1
in january , he promised increased funding to train military investigators and judge advocates about sexual assault cases , stressing the military has a " zero tolerance policy " for such crimes			1
" our men and women in uniform put their lives on the line every day to try to keep @entity3 safe , " @entity142 said then			1
" we have a moral duty to keep them safe from those who would attack their dignity and their honor			0

among the defendants are current and former defense and @entity11 secretaries
" they hated you for standing up for yourself , " says plaintiff @entity39
defense secretary @entity142 outlined new measures to combat such assaults in january
