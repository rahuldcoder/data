@entity0 -- @entity3 's negotiations with a doctor to treat @entity5 were " highly inappropriate , " a music industry veteran testified monday			1
the concert promoter 's agreement to pay dr. @entity10 $ 150,000 a month during @entity5 's comeback tour set up an " egregious " conflict of interest in which the physician was beholden to the company and himself before @entity5 's interests , he testified			1
@entity17 , who once headed @entity18 and worked for decades as an entertainment lawyer , was brought into court as an expert witness by @entity5 's mother and children in their wrongful death lawsuit against @entity3			1
the tiny @entity0 courtroom became less crowded monday after the city fire marshal , acting on a complaint from an unidentified party , ordered that fewer people be allowed inside , according to a court spokesman			1
just one seat is allotted to the public and the number of journalists allowed inside was reduced to just eight at a time under the new limits			2
the 30 seats set aside for lawyers were not reduced			0
the judge rejected @entity1 's request to televise the trial in march , but she has allowed a small camera and microphone to be focused on the witness so that people in another courtroom can watch the trial			2
@entity5 's longtime personal chef @entity48 , who was in his home when he died , is set to testify tuesday			1
also coming up , the @entity5 lawyers will show jurors the " @entity53 " documentary produced using rehearsal video			2
the wrongful death trial , which is in its eighth week , is expected to last until august , according to lawyers			1
@entity5 lawyer @entity57 estimated monday that he would call his last witness around july 8			0
one of the four alternative jurors asked the judge to dismiss him from the case monday because he has sold his @entity0 home and must move to @entity63			0
" if we are only a third of the way through there 's no way i can make it , " he said			0
judge @entity70 said it is " highly likely i 'm going to excuse you , " but she will confer with lawyers from both sides before deciding			0
the @entity5 lawsuit accuses @entity3 of liability in @entity5 's death because it negligently hired , retained or supervised dr. @entity10 , who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in @entity5 's death			1
@entity10 told police he used the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat @entity5 's insomnia so he could rest for rehearsals for his " @entity53 " concerts			1
the coroner ruled @entity5 's death was from an overdose of the drug			1
@entity3 lawyers argue it was @entity5 who chose and supervised @entity10			1
they contend @entity3 executives had no way of knowing the doctor was using propofol on @entity5			2
@entity94 , who is paid $ 500 an hour by the @entity95 as an expert witness , said he reviewed " an enormous amount " of material , including an " extraordinary number of e-mails , " to reach his conclusions that @entity10 's hiring was " highly inappropriate and " highly unusual			2
" " i have never heard of it being done , and indeed , it is my understanding up until these case , @entity3 had never done it , " @entity94 testified , referring to a concert promoter hiring a doctor for an artist			0
" it creates an inherent conflict of interest on the part of the physician , " @entity94 said			1
" the physician has dual obligations to the patient and the entity that is engaging them and who is paying his compensation			0
that , in of itself , is a conflict			0
it 's a more egregious conflict in the circumstances in this case			0
" @entity94 was critical of @entity3 ceo @entity3 ' response to an e-mail from show director @entity130 warning five days before @entity5 's death about the singer 's " continued physical weakening ad deepening emotional state			1
" " @entity130 , it is critical that neither you , me , or anyone around this show become amateur psychologists or physicians , " @entity3 wrote " i had a lengthy conversation with dr. @entity10 , who i am gaining immense respect for as i get to deal with him more			1
he said that @entity5 is not only physically equipped to perform and that discouraging him to , will hasten his decline instead of stopping it			0
dr. @entity10 also reiterated that he is mentally able to and was speaking to me from the house where he had spent the morning with @entity5			1
this doctor is extremely successful ( we check everyone out ) and does not need this gig so he totally unbiased and ethical			0
" @entity152 ' response is " very telling on a number of levels , " @entity94 said			0
" he is somewhat dismissive of mr. @entity130 's concerns			0
" " there are serious problems with that statement because he recognizes the potential of the doctor not being ethical and unbiased if he does need the gig and has financial problems , " he said			0
it shows @entity3 was aware of the potential for a conflict , @entity94 testified			2
" when , in fact , dr. @entity10 was in dire financial straits at the time and did need the gig			2
" a @entity172 detective testified earlier in the trial that @entity10 was more than $ 1 million in debt and that his @entity176 medical clinic faced eviction in the months before he was hired to treat @entity5			1
the contractual relationship between @entity3 and dr. @entity10 was " not unlike the team doctor for a football team , where the quarterback is injured and the doctor comes to the medical conclusion that the quarterback should be taken out of the game for a period of weeks , but the team does n't want him out , " @entity94 said			1
" there is an inherent conflict			2
" @entity94 also noted that the contract said @entity3 could terminate @entity10 if concerts were postponed or canceled			2
" the fact that if the tour is even just postponed that @entity3 has the ability to cease any further compensation for dr. @entity10 , giving dr. @entity10 even greater conflict of interest since he was in financial dire straits , he did need this gig and if it was postponed , which could hypothetically be in the best interest of @entity5 , he ran the risk of losing any further compensation , " he testified			1
@entity94 was asked about the so - called " smoking gun " e-mail sent by @entity3 co-ceo @entity206 ahead of a planned meeting with dr. @entity10 : " we want to remind him that it is @entity3 , not @entity5 , who is paying his salary			1
we want him to understand what is expected of him			0
" the e-mail indicates @entity3 executives wanted " to control , to some extent , dr. @entity10 " by reminding him they are paying his salary , @entity94 said			1
is that reasonable , he was asked			0
" certainly not , " @entity94 said			0
" it is indicative of the fact that they want to control the services of dr. @entity10 , as opposed to the artist			2
" @entity94 testified that @entity3 executives should have recognized there could be a problem with dr. @entity10 when he initially asked for $ 5 million for one year as @entity5 's doctor			1
" that is a pretty bizarre amount , " he said			0
the eventual agreement to pay the doctor $ 150,000 a month was still " an exorbitant amount , more than any other person on the tour was paid , " he said			0
" even more of a red flag since @entity3 was aware of another doctor who was willing to take the job for $ 40,000 a month			0
" " it 's indicative of something out of whack , " @entity94 testified			0
@entity94 also said it was " inappropriate " for @entity3 to not loop in any @entity5 lawyer or manager into the negotiations with @entity10			1
" i find that extremely unusual , " he testified			0
@entity10 signed the contract and faxed it back to @entity3 on june 24 , 2009 -- a day before @entity5 's death			1
but @entity3 's executives never signed and the signature space for @entity5 's signature was also left blank			1
" that is not inconsistent with this being a valid oral agreement , " @entity94 said			0
@entity94 testified the e-mails confirmed an oral agreement was in place			0
it is a common practice in the music industry for oral agreements to be put in writing long after the services are commenced , he said			2
he pointed to the certification of sponsorship @entity3 submitted to the @entity258 government for @entity10 to practice in @entity259 as evidence they considered him hired .			2
