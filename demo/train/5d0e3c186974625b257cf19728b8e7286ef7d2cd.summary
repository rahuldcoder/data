-- high - flying acrobats			2
bright lights and performance tents filled with adoring fans			0
it 's the stuff of which dreams are made			2
after all , who does n't want to run away with the circus ? but for @entity11 , it was n't as simple as running away -- it took a lifetime of dedication and a battle against addiction to get where he is today : dangling from the 40 - foot - high catwalk above the @entity20 big top			1
the house lights are off , and one lone spotlight shines upon @entity11 's reflective mirror - ball suit			1
he is tethered at the waist , head tilted back , arms reaching behind him to grab his foot , which is quickly flexing up toward his head			0
he starts to spin -- literally because that 's what his character is supposed to do , and figuratively , because of the searing pain he 's feeling in both shoulders as he contorts into this position			1
though it may seem that @entity20 characters are superhuman , they too can get injured			0
@entity11 is a real human being with real muscles , bones , connective tissue and joints			1
and for @entity11 , it 's not just high - flying acrobatics that cause him pain			1
" it 's sort of mundane things , " he says			2
" @entity47 hurts a lot , because i 'm rolling over on my shoulder			0
washing my hair hurts a lot			0
" after nearly 1,000 performances of " @entity54 " and a lifetime of gymnastics training , @entity11 has finally hit a wall			1
" i need to have surgery , " he says matter - of - factly			1
" i really wanted to see if i could continue on , and just kind of manage it , do a lot of physical therapy , and get out of this pain			2
but we 've done that , and we 're kind of out of options			0
" @entity20 star : why i fear pain @entity11 has what 's called a superior labral tear from anterior to posterior -- a @entity73 tear for short -- in his right shoulder			1
his biceps tendon is also torn , and he has a third tear in the subscapular area underneath his shoulder blade			0
his left shoulder has just the one injury -- another @entity73 tear			2
that one needs to be operated on as well , and soon , before he has permanent damage to the joint			0
and surgery has to be done in a way that preserves @entity11 's abilities to perform			1
" i suppose there 's always a risk that when they do fix it , that it will destroy my flexibility , " @entity11 says			1
" i 'm useful in this industry because of my flexibility			0
" now this contortionist is headed to another arena with bright lights , where all eyes are focused on him : the operating room			2
surgery is scary for anybody , but for @entity11 , it is potentially the most terrifying thing he 's ever encountered			1
@entity11 is a recovering heroin addict			1
he 's been clean for more than five years , but the thought of anything affecting his sobriety -- particularly opioid painkillers after surgery -- is something he is n't willing to risk			1
" opiates made me feel like i was the greatest human being possible			0
protected , cared for , loved -- all internally , " he said			0
" so i started my path on opiates and abused them , which ultimately lead me to heroin			2
" " i 'm terrified that if i have an opiate , will it trigger this kind of sleeping demon inside of me ? " @entity11 's fears are n't unfounded			1
" i recently met a woman who was 10 years sober , and she had breast cancer , " he said			0
" she was given @entity123 for the pain , and she ended up relapsing			2
why does that have to be our reality ? " he 's determined to not let it become his reality , both for his own benefit , and to show other addicts they do n't have to fear a day where they need surgery			1
in 2009 , 605,000 @entity136 who were 13 and older reported abusing heroin in the preceding year , according to the @entity138			0
that same year , 16 million @entity136 " misused prescription pain relievers , tranquilizers , stimulants or sedatives for nonmedical purposes , " according to that same report			2
most of these nearly 17 million @entity136 will need surgery someday , and many of them will be prescribed opioid painkillers to combat post-operative pain			1
" we do n't have exact numbers of the percentage of former addicts that are going back for surgery , but this is definitely a growing problem in @entity136 , " said dr. @entity150 , assistant professor of anesthesiology and pain management at @entity153 and the person who will be managing @entity11 's pain throughout the process			1
" as more and more people are using opioid substances for nonmedical reasons , and using them for medical reasons out of proportion for the dosages that they should be prescribed , it 's something we 're going to see a lot more of			2
" @entity11 's specific plan for post-operative pain management has several facets , the first of which is a pre-operative nerve block			1
" it 's a way of giving some numbing medication directly to the nerves that are going down to the shoulder , " said @entity150 , " and we 'll do that for as long as possible , because with each passing day , the pain is going to get better			1
" there is one problem -- @entity150 says nerve blocks are usually inserted while the patient is awake to make sure they 're placed properly			0
typically they would also give the patient a sedative to help with the pain and anxiety of the procedure , but @entity11 has abused all three of the medications they use for sedation			1
so he 'll be fully awake as @entity150 pokes around in his shoulder to place the nerve block			2
step two of @entity11 's pain - management plan involves a cocktail of medications -- none of them drugs of abuse -- intended to reduce swelling , turn down the nerves ' pain signals and reduce @entity11 's stress - response to pain			1
step three involves going to @entity214 and @entity215 meetings regularly before and after surgery			1
during step four , @entity11 will see a psychologist the day after surgery and regularly after that to ensure he stays on the right mental path			1
and just to add insult to injury , @entity11 has to go through this intense process twice -- once for each shoulder			2
" in my head , it 's like -- ok , we 're going to go and visit hell , not just once , but twice , " he said			0
" i feel like it 's somewhat of a cosmic joke on me			0
" but will these efforts pay off ? will the plan work ? " i think every patient is unique , " @entity150 says			0
" but i think @entity11 has an incredibly good psychological framework going on			2
he 's got a psychologist that 's definitely on board with him , he 's got a group of friends that are on board with him			0
he 's got @entity214 and @entity215 meetings that he goes to , and we have a medical framework that 's here for him			0
" " with that combination , i think the likelihood of success is pretty good , but none of us known for sure			0
" today marks the first day of the rest of @entity11 's life			1
he 's dropping into a new type of circus , possibly as you read this			0
today he rolls into the or for the first of his two surgeries			0
" i 'm fearful ; i 'm scared ; i do n't know what 's going to happen			0
i 'm jumping into a freezing cold pool , and i do n't know how i 'm gon na react , " he said days before the surgery			0
" i can tell you what i 'm going to do , how i 'm going to think -- all of it 's untrue , because i wo n't know until i 'm there			0
when you 're met with pain , only then you 'll know how you 'll react to it			0
