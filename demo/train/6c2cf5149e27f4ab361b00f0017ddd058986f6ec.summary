editor 's note : @entity2 is the associate editor of @entity3			0
he is also an @entity4 pundit for @entity7 's @entity6 show and writes blogs for @entity9			2
( @entity3 ) -- @entity10 called it people power , others just call it home advantage			1
@entity14 at @entity15 , @entity16 at @entity17 and -- this weekend -- @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 at @entity22 : they have the crowd behind them , they can hear the cheers from the stands , see the caps , banners and flags bearing their names			1
@entity10 was so popular with ( most of ) the @entity33 public that he even started his own movement , " @entity35 , " which peaked at @entity22 in 1987			1
" @entity37 " -- never one to let an ailment or problem go unnoticed -- was suffering from a severe wheel vibration by lap 12			0
' last dinosaur ' or @entity4 's brainiest man ? it only got worse and soon he was running five seconds behind teammate @entity44			2
the @entity46 team was n't planning to do any pit stops , but @entity10 dived in to change the offending wheel			2
he emerged 29 seconds off the lead			0
the fans were distraught -- there would n't be a repeat performance of @entity10 's win the year before at @entity53 -- but he was suddenly flying			2
" i think i broke the lap record 11 times in the last 15 laps , " he said at the time			0
he was soon up on the back of @entity44 and sold a dummy that @entity59 would have been proud of with only two laps to go			0
tires take center stage in @entity4 his second -- of four -- @entity33 @entity65 wins was complete			1
the crowd went mad and surged onto the track , so @entity10 had to come to a grinding halt on his slowing down lap to avoid running any of them over			2
@entity10 always believed the fans gave him extra power , that extra quarter of a second a lap. it may seem ridiculous , but four of his 31 @entity4 wins came on home turf in front of one of the most passionate crowds in the world			1
okay , not much comes close to the tifosi at @entity84 , bedecked in @entity85 , but @entity22 is up there			2
of course , not everyone shares the same view			0
@entity33 motorbike rider @entity88 looked a little bemused when posed the question of whether the fans gave him " extra power " ahead of his @entity65 race at @entity22 on june 17 this year			1
" i do n't know ... what ? like @entity93 with his spoon ? if he really thinks about it , it bends ... " he said smiling			0
injured female @entity4 driver 's family touched by support " i 'll tell you what , hopefully all the fans can all sit in the stands on the weekend and think that i can have a podium or something like that and it might happen			2
" but seriously you have to treat it like it 's any other race when you 're on the track			0
" two days after this he went out and broke his ankle in practice			0
come race day he started at the back of the grid -- with said broken ankle -- and stormed through the field to finish an incredible sixth , overtaking @entity124 's former world champion @entity123 on the last lap. so what of the modern @entity4 drivers ? it does n't make for great reading if you 're @entity20 / @entity19 / @entity21 and hoping for a win this weekend in front of the 100,000 - strong crowd			1
@entity135 -- 0 @entity134 @entity65 wins			1
@entity136 -- 0 @entity138 @entity65 wins			2
@entity20 -- 0 @entity33 @entity65 wins			1
@entity139 -- one @entity33 @entity65 win			1
@entity141 -- one @entity143 @entity65 win ( and one win in the @entity145 in @entity146 this year , which took him to the top of the championship standings )			1
the only man to have serious success on home soil is @entity152 with four @entity134 @entity65 wins , behind only compatriot @entity153 -- who won it six times between 1926 - 39			1
but seven - time world champion @entity152 has won a record 91 grands prix and it 's no surprise the 43 - year - old managed four of those at @entity158 , plus five victories when the @entity145 was held at the nurburgring			1
however , he has finished ninth and eighth at the @entity134 gp since returning from retirement with @entity163			0
this weekend most people 's money is on @entity135			0
before his @entity166 gave way in the last race , he was streets ahead in @entity146			0
no way anyone was going to catch him			0
@entity141 may have won fantastically in front of his home crowd , but he was cautious afterwards			1
" @entity166 is fast " echoed round the paddock			0
@entity175 , though , has been throwing the kitchen sink , and many millions , at its 2012 challenger in order to close the gap			0
and with the unpredictability this season has produced there 's no need to write off either @entity20 -- who has always been dogged by bad luck in his home grand prix -- or his fellow former world champion @entity19			1
also , there 's always that home advantage , but maybe that 's just a load of rubbish ? we 'll see for ourselves on sunday .			0

@entity33 @entity65 at @entity22 is home race for @entity20 and @entity19
former @entity4 world champion @entity10 used to say home crowd gave him advantage
@entity175 drivers to have backing of the *majority* of 100,000 - plus crowd *due* to attend
defending champ @entity135 is *favorite* despite @entity141 leading championship
