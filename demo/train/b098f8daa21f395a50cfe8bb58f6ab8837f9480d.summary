i do n't know what a " real woman " is supposed to look like			1
everybody keeps telling me @entity5 -- who always looked unreal -- is suddenly " real " because an unretouched photo of her leaked on @entity7			1
i 'm sure you , like millions of others , have seen it by now			0
in the picture , @entity11 is posing and rocking a feathery thing in what looks like her underwear			0
and , wow , she does n't look perfect			1
she still looks gorgeous , but @entity18 she 's flawed			1
the image came from a photo shoot from 2013 with @entity21 and @entity22			2
the @entity24 edition of @entity25 is thrilled			0
" no matter where the photo came from , it 's an enlightenment -- we 've always known @entity11 was beautiful , but seeing her like this only makes us love her more			1
" oh , @entity25 -- how big of you ! we all know you do n't actually believe real women sell magazines			1
sadly , @entity11 's husband does n't seem to think so either			1
shortly after that unaltered picture of @entity11 hit the @entity38 , @entity36 shared a picture of his bikini - clad wife lounging by the pool			2
no age spots in that photo			2
i must admit it was refreshing , though , to read the many , many comments from women around the world taking comfort in the imperfect @entity5			1
@entity51 wrote on my @entity53 page : " this is how all @entity55 's look			2
a little pouch tummy , tan lines , flawed skin , and we still look great			0
seeing this makes me feel better about how i look			0
it 's a shame " beauty " mags have to alter these kinds of pics at all			2
" @entity51 , i hear you loud and clear , but you 've gone mad ! i do n't know about you , but the first time i picked up @entity67 at the age of 12 , i realized i was way too chubby and my skin already looked like leather			2
when i graduated to the high fashion magazines , i discovered my body had to look unreal to be sexy			2
why do you think that photo of @entity75 - with - a - glass - of - champagne - on - her - rear almost broke the @entity38 ? besides , a good chunk of @entity24 deride what 's real			1
the @entity81 loves to regale us with truly awful pictures of stars with cellulite , back fat and dark roots			0
and the captions underneath do n't say , " wow , ai n't she sexy ! " try googling " unretouched photo " and see what you get			1
a veritable potpourri of supposedly unaltered photos of @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and even @entity97			1
( that 's my fave -- the re-toucher enhanced his , um , attribute			2
) opinion : is @entity11 's cellulite photo empowering ? some magazines are trying			1
recently it featured an impossibly slender , busty , hairless woman with her pants down on its cover , but inside -- and @entity112 says this is historic -- there is a " real " woman			0
and , by that , @entity112 means , " plus - sized			0
" as @entity120 so wonderfully put it : " @entity117 to put normal - sized woman @entity118			0
" hmmm , maybe next year @entity112 will put her on the cover			0
i would n't bet the farm on that one			0
perhaps the most honest assessment of the whole @entity5 uproar came from a co-worker who shall remain nameless			1
she told me her eyes went directly to @entity11 's stomach and then to her sun - damaged skin			0
in other words , she noticed @entity11 's flaws first and fixated on them , just as she fixates on her own flaws every morning when she looks into the mirror			0
i do it , too			0
and that 's the thing , right ? those retouched photos that we 're accustomed to seeing have invaded women 's psyches and held us up to impossibly unrealistic standards			1
so it was a moment of surprise and relief that when i showed that unaltered picture of @entity5 to my husband			1
he did n't notice her flaws			0
he simply said , " wow , she looks great ! " no wonder i love him .			0

@entity157 : we all know that real women wo n't be able to sell magazines
while *people* are *praising* @entity5 's unaltered photo , the truth is that retouched photos wo n't go away
