-- @entity1 is the exclusive gatekeeper to its @entity3 , able to reject apps at will -- as it did july 28 with @entity5			1
some would - be @entity3 developers , rejected by @entity1 , are turning to an unauthorized app store called @entity8			1
but some developers are n't taking the rejection lying down : they 're turning instead to an unauthorized app store called @entity8 , where forbidden wares continue to exist -- and even earn developers some money			1
that store is operated by @entity8 , more fondly known in the @entity3 " @entity17 " community as @entity8			1
only five months old , his app store @entity8 specializes in selling apps that @entity1 would reject or ban ( or already has )			1
to use @entity8 or the apps available through it , customers need to jailbreak their phones -- hack them to work around @entity1 - imposed restrictions -- a process that @entity1 claims is illegal			1
indeed , you can even get a @entity5 app , @entity30 , through @entity8			2
after @entity1 pulled the app from its @entity3 , developer @entity32 ( who is not affiliated with @entity34 ) made it available for free through @entity8			1
it 's difficult to get accurate data on how many customers have jailbroken their iphones			0
but based on the number of unique device identifiers tracked on his server , @entity40 claims that about 4 million , or 10 percent of the 40 million @entity3 and @entity46 owners to date , have installed @entity8			1
on a recent day , he said 470,000 people were connecting to the @entity8 store , up from 350,000 per day just a few months ago			2
among many free apps , there are also 15 paid apps in @entity8 , and the store has earned $ 220,000 in overall sales in just five months			1
" people are so annoyed by @entity1 and their s --- , and if you give them opportunity to go around it , then they 'll even pay for it , " said @entity54 , a developer whose app @entity56 earned $ 19,000 in sales in just two weeks through @entity8			1
though @entity8 is relatively young , the underground " @entity17 " community has existed since the first @entity3 launched in 2007			2
that year , @entity1 did n't yet have an app store for its @entity3 , stifling the true potential of the device			1
this limitation inspired digital rebels to hack away at the @entity3 's closed platform in an effort to free its mind			0
the result ? an app called @entity73 , opening a door for early @entity3 owners to add games , utilities and other third - party software coded by developers			1
it was n't until 2008 that @entity1 offered a software development kit for third - party coders to make programs for its @entity3			1
that led to the opening of the official @entity3 in july 2008			0
@entity1 's store grew rapidly , accumulating 65,000 apps and serving over 1.5 billion downloads to date			2
many developers abandoned @entity73 for the more popular @entity3 , leaving behind an underground space where unauthorized wares could continue to exist			2
@entity73 died and became reborn as @entity8 , which evolved from an app library into a store in march 2009			2
to gain access to @entity8 , @entity3 owners must jailbreak their smartphones using some freely available tools courtesy of the hacker group @entity99			1
given the nature of this procedure , it 's clear @entity8 's primary audience consists of nerdy rebels wishing to utilize the full power of their iphones , restriction - free			2
@entity8 's numbers appear small compared to the rare stories we hear about developers turning into millionaires with hot sales of their @entity3 apps in the @entity3			1
but the idea behind a store like @entity8 is that you do n't have to be huge to make money			2
with a smaller market , fewer competitors and a reasonably large customer base , each developer has a higher chance for making a quick buck , @entity40 said			0
plus , you get more personal attention : developers submitting their app through @entity8 need only contact @entity40 , and their app can be made available almost immediately			2
that 's an enticing alternative to @entity1 's approval process , which can take months and is notoriously opaque : some @entity3 developers have faced difficulty getting answers to simple questions from @entity1 about their apps			1
it 's obvious what 's driving @entity3 customers toward @entity8 : @entity1 's rejections and restrictions of major @entity3 apps			1
most notably , @entity1 recently banned apps supporting @entity5 , the search giant 's internet - based phone enhancement service that can provide cellphone users with free text messaging and transcribed voicemail			2
angry consumers and developers theorize that @entity1 banned the @entity5 apps so as not to detract business from its partner @entity151 's phone services			2
the incident has brewed so much controversy that even the @entity155 has gotten involved , sending letters to @entity151 , @entity1 and @entity34 inquiring about the reasons for the rejections			0
" looks like @entity1 and @entity151 pissed off a lot of people , " @entity32 wrote in a july 28 blog post			0
" i 'll be releasing @entity163 on @entity8 for free today or tomorrow			0
" another high - profile @entity3 regulation involves @entity165 , an app that enables @entity3 users to stream video from a @entity165 device hooked up to a tv			2
when @entity165 originally submitted the app , it was capable of streaming over both @entity173 and the cellular 3g connection			0
however , @entity1 requested @entity165 to modify the app to work on @entity173 only			0
@entity151 said this was a necessary move to prevent congestion on its 3g network			0
that restriction spawned the most successful @entity8 app to date , @entity56 , developed by @entity54			0
@entity56 , a $ 2 app that has sold 9,500 copies , allows the @entity3 to circumvent any network limitations imposed by @entity1			1
for example , the app enables @entity165 users to stream tv over @entity56 as well as @entity173 ; and when using the @entity190 app @entity191 to place phone calls , customers can also use the cellular connection , whereas normally the app only enables users to dial over @entity173			0
" it 's just amazing what you can do on such a little cellphone , and @entity1 just forbids customers from doing these things , and it 's just a shame , " @entity54 said			0
" that 's why i 'm so happy there 's a @entity8 store			0
" another developer who reports positive experiences with @entity8 is @entity208 , who said he has made more money through the unauthorized store than @entity1 's @entity3			1
in february , his app @entity211 sold 694 copies in @entity8 , compared to 91 copies of @entity215 in the @entity3			1
" i guess you could say the @entity3 is kind of like @entity217 , with more crap than you 'd ever want to buy , " @entity208 said			0
" and @entity8 is like the general store that has everything you want and need , from fresh cuts of meat to those homemade cookies you ca n't get anywhere else			0
" though some developers say they 're having better experiences selling apps through @entity8 , it 's unlikely they will succeed on a longer term , said @entity231 , vice president of @entity232 , an @entity3 app analytics company			1
she said the average consumer would prefer to purchase apps through a well trusted source such as @entity1			0
" there have been all these apps downloaded in the @entity3 because it 's easy for consumers to find , download and pay for apps , " @entity231 said			0
" this model is new because @entity1 has been training people how to download music to their ipods for years			0
" however , even in the case of the @entity3 , developers who strike it rich still face challenges recreating their success , said @entity251 , co-creator of the e-book reader classics , which has sold over 400,000 copies to date			0
" if you 're hoping to reach the mainstream , the best you can hope for is your app catches on fire and charts high enough for you to make a windfall , " @entity251 said			0
" essentially you aim for the jackpot , and if you do n't hit that , it 's not going to make you a living			0
" @entity40 said it was too soon to tell whether @entity8 would provide developers stable incomes , but he recommends they give it a try , considering the successes some are experiencing			1
he admits , however , he is n't making much money as the creator of @entity8 : like @entity1 , he takes 30 percent of each app sale to cover taxes			1
" i do n't make much money off this project , but i value the community , and i look forward to how this changes the device landscape , " @entity40 said			0
