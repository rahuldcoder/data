here 's a sobering statistic for the unofficial start of summer , when we gear up for picnics , barbecues and our kids having more free time on their hands : @entity8 kicks off what 's known as 100 deadliest days for teen drivers			1
from @entity8 through @entity12 in 2012 , nearly 1,000 people were killed in crashes involving teen drivers , and more than 550 of those killed were teens , according to @entity16 data analyzed by the nonprofit @entity17			1
some of the reasons for the spike make sense			0
teens are driving more during the summer and it might be more recreational than purposeful , the @entity17 reports			1
for instance , instead of driving back and forth to school , they might be driving to the beach , lake or river , and heading down roads they have n't driven before			0
but one of the biggest reasons for the summer risk increase is that teens might be driving more frequently with more of their friends			1
" we have always known that passengers were a big risk for teens , but what we 're really finding out now is passengers may be one of the most important risks for teens , even more so than things like texting , " said @entity34 , the @entity17 's vice president of strategic initiatives			1
think about it this way , @entity34 said : passengers are a distraction the entire time a teen is driving , whereas the distraction from texting is probably limited to the seconds or minutes they 're looking at screens instead of the road			1
passengers increase the risk of a teen driver having a fatal crash by at least 44 % , according to the @entity17			1
" it 's tragic that parents do n't really appreciate the risks of passengers , " said @entity34 , who said parents may understand the risks of texting or cell phone use , but are n't as aware of the dangers of a new driver hitting the road with friends in the car			1
a majority of states have laws on the books regarding the number of passengers allowed for new drivers			1
some states do n't allow any for the first six months or year after getting a license ; some allow one passenger			1
'' if you have a kid who had their license for less than one year , you have to think very , very carefully about the conditions or the situations in which you allow them to carry any passengers			2
you really do , " @entity34 said			0
@entity90 : parents of teens share driving tips @entity34 , a father of six in @entity94 , @entity95 , did n't allow his children to drive with passengers for the first year of their official driving lives			2
" it was a real bone of contention , " he said			0
" they were n't happy about it , but they all survived			0
" a recent study found that loud conversations and horseplay between passengers were more likely than technology to result in a dangerous incident involving teen drivers			1
the study by the @entity113 @entity112 tracked 52 high - school age drivers in @entity115 who agreed to have cameras installed in their cars			2
the study appeared in the @entity120 this spring			0
when there was loud conversation in the car , teen drivers were six times more likely to need to take actions like making an evasive maneuver to avoid a crash			1
when there was horseplay in the vehicle , they were three times more likely to get into a similarly serious episode , according to the study			0
" forty - three states currently restrict newly licensed drivers from having more than one young passenger in their vehicle , " @entity135 , senior research scientist at the @entity112 , and director of the @entity138 , said in a news release			1
" the results of this study illustrate the importance of such restrictions , which increase the safety of drivers , their passengers and others on the road by reducing the potential chaos that novice drivers experience			1
" earlier this year , we traveled to @entity156 , @entity157 , to talk with @entity158 , her husband and her 16 - year - old son @entity160 about how they were trying to teach @entity160 about safety as he learns to drive			0
@entity160 will get his license on june 3			0
when i recently got back in touch with @entity158 about the dangers of the summer months , her anxiety went up			2
" my first reaction is fear			0
then sadness , " @entity158 said via e-mail			0
" i just heard a similar statistic about prom night being a very dangerous time			2
... i think we have to take the time to to talk to our children and remind them of the risks and talk about how to minimize them			2
" @entity34 of the @entity17 said the best advice for parents is to understand the risks about passengers and drive with them so they can get accustomed to having people in the car			1
he also suggest parents consider the risks of driving at night			0
" it 's not the time of night			2
it 's how dark it is			0
that 's really the risk here , and i think too many parents think of night driving as a social curfew			2
' well , i 'll let my kid stay out until 11 p.m. so he 's fine , ' " @entity34 said			0
" it has nothing to do with that			0
it has to do with the risk of driving after dark			2
" @entity203 , a mom of two in @entity205 , @entity206 , has two girls who are still a few years away from driving age			0
the best thing parents can do , she said on @entity211 , is to teach teen drivers the best we can			1
" give them the most knowledge we can so that they can adequately protect themselves , then pray , " @entity203 said			0
" there are so many variables and we only have so much control			0
" what do you think is the best way to keep teen drivers safe this summer ? share your thoughts in the comments or tell @entity227 on @entity228 or @entity229 on @entity211			1
