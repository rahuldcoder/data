@entity0 , @entity1 -- staring at the throngs of media representatives who came out to hear and see her friday , @entity3 took another step into the fight for her future			1
the undocumented student from @entity12 whose case has become a lightning rod in the immigration debate had been released on $ 2,500 bond just a couple hours earlier			1
the 21 - year - old student at @entity18 in @entity1 surrendered friday morning to authorities in response to a warrant for her arrest issued wednesday night by the @entity23			1
standing nervously before the crowd , @entity3 fought back tears when people cheered for her			1
the media bombarded her with questions as she tried to give voice to her struggle			0
just a week earlier , she 'd been released from a deportation facility in @entity32 after being stopped in march for a minor traffic violation			1
" if i were to be deported , i 'd have to start all over again , " she said			0
" i 'm hoping for the best			2
" the sheriff 's office said she gave a false address when stopped for that violation , a felony charge that her attorney denies			2
a spotlight has been trained on @entity41 since gov. @entity42 signed into law a bill that requires law enforcement officials to seek proof of legal @entity48 residency from anyone whom they have stopped on suspicion of having violated the law			1
but advocates working with @entity3 point out that a little - understood program already gives local authorities in many states the latitude to act as immigration officials -- a right that is often abused , they say			1
" the future of @entity41 already exists in @entity62 and @entity63 [ also in @entity1 ] , " said @entity59 , executive director of the @entity60			1
near him were other @entity3 supporters , some holding signs reading " education not deportation			1
" under the @entity67 287 ( g ) program , state and local law enforcement can partner with the federal agency to gain some immigration enforcement authority in their own jurisdictions			0
if they conclude that someone is in the country illegally , they can turn that person over to @entity67			0
last year , a change to the partnership program prioritized the detention and arrest of those who have allegedly committed crimes			0
the @entity87 is one of 71 law enforcement agencies in 26 states that have entered into this partnership program , according to the @entity67 website			0
labeling the program a " civil rights disaster , " @entity93 , legal director of the @entity94 , said it " leads to racial profiling , distracts police from looking for real criminals and destroys families			0
" the @entity101 of @entity1 called friday for an end to the program			1
" @entity3 's case is yet another outrageous example of the unaccountable local enforcement of immigration laws in @entity62 gone awry , " said @entity104 , @entity101 of @entity1 's national security / immigrants ' rights project director			1
@entity3 's legal problems started in late march when her car was stopped on the @entity18 campus			1
born in @entity12 but living in the @entity48 since she was 11 , she could not produce a driver 's license , so she handed over as identification an expired passport from @entity12			1
she was arrested the next day and turned over to immigration officials			2
she spent more than a month in the @entity119 in @entity32			0
friends came out in force and marched on campus in her defense			0
earlier this month , she was released , and her deportation was deferred for a year , which will allow her to finish her studies			2
she has n't returned to classes yet , but looks forward to earning her degree			0
" i 'm just trying to live the @entity48 dream and finish my education , " she said			1
calling @entity3 " a symbol of what 's wrong with the immigration system , " immigration attorney @entity130 thanked @entity67 for allowing his client to stay in the country for a year to finish her studies			1
he then set out to educate people about the challenges facing @entity3 , providing a reason why she did not have a license			1
" @entity3 ca n't start the process to become a @entity48 citizen because she 's not allowed to , " he said			1
" if @entity3 could obtain a license , she would have			2
" in a statement wednesday night , @entity62 sheriff @entity149 said , " ms. @entity3 knew that she was in the @entity48 without authority to be here and voluntarily chose to operate a vehicle without a driver 's license , which is a violation of @entity1 law			1
she has further complicated her situation with her blatant disregard for @entity1 law by giving false information			2
" as for the use of the @entity67 program , he said , " i value any tool that helps me enforce the law and remove violators from our community			0
" but the band of lawyers and advocates who rallied around @entity163 say @entity62 is abusing its power			2
in a joint statement thursday night , they voiced outrage over @entity3 's treatment and suggested that the felony charge is trumped - up			2
" it is obvious from all the documents that i 've seen that she has done nothing wrong and has given her proper address to @entity62 and immigration officials , " said @entity170 , @entity3 's criminal attorney			2
" there has been no crime committed			0
" the car 's registration simply reflected her old address , @entity170 said in an interview , and she provided her new address when she was taken into custody			0
@entity170 said he has the documents to prove this and looks forward to clearing her name			0
in front of the crowd that gathered friday , he said of his client , " she has not failed us			0
the system has failed her			0
" the @entity194 likened the actions of officials to " schoolyard bullying			0
" @entity59 , of the @entity60 , called the sheriff " @entity202 , " saying he " has abused his authority in this case			0
his actions clearly demonstrate the problems that occur when local law officers are granted authority to enforce immigration laws			0
" " sheriff @entity149 has embarked on a witch hunt , wasting money and county resources for political gain , " said @entity208 of the @entity209			1
" this is not about public safety			0
