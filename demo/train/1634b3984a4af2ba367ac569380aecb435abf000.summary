-- last week , the @entity1 was buzzing with the news that a dna test of white supremacist @entity4 revealed that 14 % of his genes originated in @entity6			1
the look on @entity4 's face as he received the news ? priceless			1
@entity4 appeared on " the @entity10 " and discussed his plans to create an all - white town for white supremacists in @entity14 , @entity15			1
" whites are the highest expression of @entity3 on the planet , " he said on the show			0
when @entity4 received the dna results , he wrote it off			2
" this is called statistical noise , " @entity4 responded			2
" oil and water do n't mix. " well , apparently we are n't talking oil and water , are we mr. @entity4 ? we 're talking human beings -- and they 've been mixing since the beginning of time			2
that history is what created the " one - drop rule " in @entity34 : a legal classification that held that anyone with as little as " one drop " of @entity38 or black ancestry was to be categorized as black and treated accordingly			1
until 1967 , when it was ruled unconstitutional , the " one - drop rule " provided the legal and quantitative definition of blackness , and whiteness			1
so while @entity4 might " look white " today , in 1813 or 1913 , his 14 % @entity38 ancestry would have been more than enough to render him black by law			1
in 2013 , however , the irony of his heritage shows just how nuanced racial identity is beyond skin color			1
during the period of @entity34 slavery , 1619 to 1865 , freedom was predicated on skin color			1
if you were white , you were free ; if you were black , you were enslaved			0
but this simple social order soon became complicated by miscegenation ; and with the rampant increase in racial mixing , the lines between white and black , free and enslaved , became more and more blurred			2
whites were afraid of losing their control over the enslaved population			0
they needed to maintain a firm color line			0
so , state governments began instituting anti-miscegenation laws			0
various and varying articulations of the " one - drop rule " emerged : a classification that held that anyone from 1/8 to 1/16 to 1/32 to any known trace of @entity38 or black ancestry was to be categorized as black and treated accordingly			1
how that " drop " was measured varied from state to state			0
the rhetoric of white supremacy not only argued that the races were distinctly different , but also that the black race specifically was inferior , therefore justifying enslavement			0
mixing , then , lowered human quality			0
in order to maintain its superiority , whiteness had to remain pure			0
so , what it meant to be white was to be free of " otherness " in general , blackness , specifically			0
in this way , miscegenation was a threat to the survival of the white race			0
the " one - drop rule , " then , became critical in its defense			1
to be white in @entity34 was to be " pure			2
" or was it ? a 2002 study of racial admixture conducted by @entity103 molecular anthropologist @entity102 showed that among those who self - identify as white , upward of 30 % have at least 2.3 % @entity38 ancestry -- the equivalent of having had three black ancestors somewhere within the previous five generations of their family			1
what that means , then , is that 30 % of the folks who call themselves white have much more than one drop , including white supremacist @entity4			1
dna testing also reveals that somewhere around 60 % of black @entity34 have white ancestry , @entity102 's study found			1
taken together , it 's clear that racial purity is as much a delusion as white supremacy			2
blood does not define identity			0
although the " one - drop rule " in many ways serves foundational to black @entity34 racial identity , and has functioned to draw borders around the black community as we know it , one drop of " blackness " -- whatever that is -- does not constitute black identity			1
@entity135 , as an identity and as a lived experience , is much more complex and nuanced than any number of drops on a family tree			0
blackness is as much about who creates you as it is about what you make of yourself			0
so , while i was thoroughly amused by the sight of @entity4 's face when he learned that he , too , is " of @entity38 descent , " i am clear that those dna test results do not magically make him black ; no number of drops ever could			1
and blackness is too beautiful to be forced upon people who do n't want it			0
so no worries , mr. @entity4 , your secret 's safe with me			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity157 .			0

white supremacist @entity4 learned that 14 % of his genes originated in @entity6
that would make him legally " black " under @entity34 's one - drop rule , @entity157 says
the " one - drop rule " provided the legal and quantitative definition of blackness , and whiteness
