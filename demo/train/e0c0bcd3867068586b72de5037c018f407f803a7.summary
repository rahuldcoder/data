-- in his campaign to become @entity7 's first african - american @entity5 nominee for governor , @entity2 rep. @entity1 downplayed race , bucked the black establishment and watched his opponent rack up endorsements from the state 's key minority political groups			1
his strategy was unconventional , but in the days before the election , it appeared to be working			0
@entity1 held a steady lead over agriculture commissioner @entity18 in the weeks leading up to the primary , but when the votes came in tuesday night , @entity20 pulled out the win -- stomping @entity1 with more than 60 percent of the vote			1
@entity20 will face the winner of the @entity26 contest , which will be decided in a july 13 runoff			0
current @entity26 gov. @entity26 could not seek re-election because he is term - limited by law			0
" this is not exactly the speech i planned to give , " @entity1 said as he conceded and encouraged supporters to back @entity20			2
" as i leave the stage , i hope that this district will continue to advance			0
let 's keep on believing in @entity7			2
let 's keep on believing in tomorrow , " he said in a speech from his congressional district			0
had the four - term congressman come out on top , he could have become @entity7 's first black governor and only the third elected black governor in @entity2 history			1
the historical implications of a @entity1 victory were not lost on the @entity46			0
a black man could have taken the oath of office near where gov. @entity50 declared " @entity51 today , segregation tomorrow , segregation forever ! " in his 1963 inaugural address and where @entity55 took the oath of office as president of the @entity59 in 1861			0
@entity1 , much to the chagrin of black political leaders , had no interest in focusing on the symbolism			1
" he sees himself as a leader rather than a black leader , " said @entity64 , a former @entity7 @entity5 congressman and author of " @entity66 : an @entity69 in recent @entity70			1
" @entity1 opted against soliciting the endorsements of the major black political organizations in the state , all of which went to @entity20			1
" the @entity79 - @entity2 voters who will participate in the primary need no permission , and no sample ballots , to decide who they favor in this governor 's race , " @entity1 said of his decision , the @entity76 reported			2
the move highlighted the chasm between @entity1 , 42 , and black establishment groups , headed by civil rights leaders like @entity5 activist @entity90 and former @entity92 mayor @entity91			1
they felt that @entity1 had shunned his own race , personally insulted them with his campaign and stood no chance against a @entity26 candidate in november , @entity64 said			2
@entity90 charged last month that @entity1 could n't win the general election because he 'd already told black voters he did n't want their vote			2
" they still carry the scars of the civil rights movement , where blacks had to stick together , " said @entity64			0
" [ @entity1 ] does not have those scars , but he is the beneficiary of those wars			0
it 's a generational fight that 's going on throughout the @entity46			0
" a primary win for @entity1 would have " rewritten the textbook on @entity116 racial politics , " he said , sending a message to @entity5 candidates that they can win without those groups ' backing			1
his loss shows that the old guard has not lost its grip on the black electorate , @entity64 said			0
" this is the way that these black leaders have organized minority votes and effectively impacted @entity116 politics for decades			0
and it looks like they will continue to control and channel black influence in the political process for a while now , " he added			0
but it was n't just the clout of the black establishment that made some black voters question @entity1			2
" @entity1 did do something to make black people not want to vote for him , and that is his ' no ' vote for health care reform			1
even before the black political groups stepped in the picture and refused to endorse him , he had already established a negative relationship with some of the black voters , " said @entity140 , an associate professor of black political behavior at the @entity142			1
@entity1 , a friend of president @entity146 and an early supporter of his campaign , voted against the president 's health care reform package in november			1
while none of @entity7 's representatives voted in favor of the bill , @entity1 was the only member of the @entity155 to vote against it			1
some black voters accused @entity1 of putting african - americans under the bus in order to get the white vote , @entity157 said			2
the rev. @entity164 was equally upset , saying , " you ca n't vote against health care and call yourself a black man , " @entity163 reported			1
@entity1 ' office responded to @entity163 with a statement that said , " one of the reasons that i like and admire rev. @entity164 is that 21 years ago he inspired the idea that a black politician would not be judged simply as a black leader , " referring to @entity164 's 1988 presidential run			2
" the best way to honor rev. @entity164 's legacy is to decline to engage in an argument with him that begins and ends with race , " he said			0
@entity1 has tried to keep the focus off of race throughout his years in politics			0
during @entity1 ' first successful campaign , incumbent @entity186 tried to portray his challenger as not " black enough " for @entity7 's 7th district , which includes urban areas in @entity92 and @entity191 and rural , predominately black areas in the western part of the state			1
the argument failed to resonate , and @entity1 won the election			0
in announcing his gubernatorial run in february 2009 , @entity1 said he 's always clung to one central belief : " i think the poet was wrong when he said that the past shall guide our steps and that we shall judge the future by that which has already happened			1
" i think that 's wrong			0
i think that here in the state of @entity7 , we do n't have to have the past dictate our future , " he said .			1

@entity18 comes out on top in @entity5 primary for @entity7 's gubernatorial race
major black political groups backed @entity20 ; @entity1 declined to solicit endorsements
@entity1 was only member of @entity155 to vote against health care bill
" we do n't have to have the past dictate our future , " @entity1 said when he announced his bid
