-- @entity2 men say to look before you leap			2
in @entity5 , it 's advisable to look before you land			2
that 's because , in @entity5 , where seaplanes are common , you just might land on a whale			1
last week in tiny , remote @entity12 , @entity11 was shooting video of a seaplane coming in for a landing			1
it was a mundane scene in the island community that 's only accessible by boat or seaplane			2
the video starts out normal			2
but as the plane lowers , it 's clear something is different about this approach			0
" all the sudden , the pilot advanced the throttle and i did n't know why			0
i thought , ' oh something must be wrong , ' " @entity28 told @entity0			0
that something was a whale , a humpback , swimming just under the surface			1
for a moment , it appeared the whale and plane would collide			1
but the pilot pulled up , getting just enough lift to avoid the mammal			0
the plane landed safely seconds later			0
later @entity28 showed the pilot the video he shot			0
@entity28 said the pilot told him he did n't notice the whale ; he reacted to the commotion on the shore			1
guys were pointing and yelling			0
right as the pilot pulled up , the whale breached , clearing his blowhole and drenching the plane 's windshield			1
that 's one way to make a splash			0
jetliner diverts to @entity57 , mechanical glitch blamed rare albino whale ' parades ' off @entity62 coast			1

the whale was swimming just under the surface
it *happened* in tiny , remote @entity12
