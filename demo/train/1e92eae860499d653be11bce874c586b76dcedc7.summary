-- @entity1 on thursday acquitted nine medical professionals who were accused of involvement in unrest in the country but upheld convictions of another 11			1
all 20 were convicted last year of attempting to overthrow the government and were sentenced to lengthy prison terms			1
@entity1 sliced the sentences of many whose convictions were upheld thursday			1
of the 11 whose convictions stand , two are at large , five will be released on time served and the other four can appeal their sentences again , the @entity12 announced			1
human rights groups and some of the medical professionals , which include doctors , say they were treating people injured in last year 's protests against the government			1
the group @entity25 denounced the sentences and called on the government to set aside the verdicts against all the medics			1
" eighteen of the accused medical professionals have alleged that @entity1 security forces tortured them while in detention , " the group said in a statement			1
@entity35 , vice president of the @entity36 , tweeted that the nine acquittals should not be seen as an achievement , because " they should n't have been arrested and tortured to begin with			1
" in a statement , the government insisted that " no medic is being charged for treating protesters			2
the charges brought against the medics were primarily for their involvement in politicizing their profession , breaching medical ethics " and , most seriously , calling for " and involvement in the overthrow of the monarchy			2
" another @entity1 doctor , @entity53 , told @entity0 last month that during last year 's protests , " we became automatic witnesses			1
" he was on call -- one of only three neurosurgeons at @entity60 , on february 18 , 2011 -- when an injured protester was brought in			2
the patient had been shot in the head			2
" for treating him and then expressing my concerns about the way he was injured , i got labeled as a traitor , " @entity53 told @entity0 's @entity64			2
two months later , he was arrested , he said			2
" they took me into an interrogation center for about four days of torture			0
i was with other doctors			0
they made us stand for days together ... without sleep , without toilet privileges , without anything			0
and in between that , you get abused , you get spat at , you got insulted ... and everybody who passes by you just beats you on the head or the back			0
" " but the worst thing is a room , an electronically locked room ... and when the doors open , all hell breaks loose			0
because you start hearing these shouts of torture			0
... your turn is next			0
and my turn was next			0
... somebody even took a gun to my head and threatened me with death , " @entity53 said			0
he was later released , but as a changed man , he said			0
@entity1 officials have denied ordering torture			1
