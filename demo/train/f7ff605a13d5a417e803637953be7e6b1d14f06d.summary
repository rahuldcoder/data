-- " and now it 's time for one last bow , like all your other selves			1
@entity7 's hour is over now , the clock is striking @entity8 's			0
" with those poetic words , @entity10 's @entity9 summed up the stakes of wednesday night 's @entity14 episode of " @entity15			1
" following a hugely successful , well - received 50th anniversary episode last month , it seemed fitting that the show would bid goodbye to @entity19 for an encore			1
the episode certainly ran the gamut , at various times showing the doctor bald , naked and growing very old			1
it was a bittersweet night for " who " fans ( or " @entity29 " ) , to say the least			0
of course , we 've known for several months that this was coming , but the reactions on social media made clear that many in the audience were n't ready to say goodbye to @entity19 's @entity36			1
i 'm emotionally wrecked , " tweeted @entity38			0
" my feelings are not ok , " is how @entity39 put it			0
so without further ado , here are five moments from the episode that had us feeling all of our feelings : 1			1
the doctor leaves @entity9 ( twice ) things started off smoothly enough , with the doctor pretending to be @entity9 's boyfriend at @entity14 dinner			1
a few sitcom - ish moments ( and @entity54 , weeping angels and @entity56 -- including one disembodied ) later , and soon the doctor learned that @entity58 and the other @entity59 could soon return , using a crack in the wall , in a small town called @entity14 -- a time field seen in the @entity36 's first episode			1
the @entity54 , @entity56 and more were ready to take on the @entity59 , however , and the doctor was prepared to literally save @entity14 ( not to mention the entire planet , @entity67 )			1
but he did n't think he could protect @entity9 and sent her back home without her knowledge			0
as centuries went by on @entity67 , the doctor started to show his age and finally , @entity9 returned with the @entity74 and the " feels " came along with her			2
seeing the doctor and his companion -- who had earlier unwittingly declared her feelings for him -- reunited was a hugely uplifting moment , though soon the doctor sent her away again , after saying he would n't			2
( sorry , @entity9 , the doctor lies			2
) but she returned one last time ... looking back on 50 years of ' @entity15 ' 2			1
the last doctor ? those who 've followed " @entity15 " for a while will remember there 's a limit to the number of regenerations he gets , exactly 12			1
after @entity9 returned the first time , the aging doctor told @entity9 that he had used them all up , counting @entity93 's @entity82 from the previous episode , and a time when the @entity96 regenerated into himself			1
could this be the end of the doctor for good ? after her second return , having read the aforementioned poem from a @entity14 cracker , and as the doctor began to die of old age , she pleaded with the time field to save him			1
as the @entity54 prepared to attack , the time field appeared , granting the doctor more regenerative energy , which he used to lay waste to all of the invading armies ( " love from @entity58 , boys ! " ) -- but it also meant that his time was up			1
goodbye , @entity7 @entity9 returned to the tardis , finding the doctor back to his old self again			2
but despite his reset youthful appearance , he was still dying			0
he had a lot to think about in his final moments in this body			2
when you think about it , we 're all different people all through our lives , " he said			0
" and that 's ok , that 's good , as long as you keep moving , as long as you remember all the people that you used to be			0
i will not forget one line of this , not one day , i swear			0
i will always remember when the doctor was me			2
" lump in the throat , anyone ? is the @entity131 a @entity59 ? 4			0
' raggedy man ' then the doctor remembered his first companion , the first face he saw in this body : @entity137			2
in a surprise appearance , @entity138 returned for a cameo as @entity137 , to say , " raggedy man , good night			0
" is it any wonder that " raggedy man " trended worldwide for hours on @entity144 ? @entity7 knew his time was up , and took off his trademark bowtie			2
and at this point , the @entity147 had a good cry			0
@entity150 as @entity9 begged the doctor not to go , he suddenly had a brand new face			0
@entity9 's " anime eyes " said it all			0
this was a brand new doctor indeed			0
@entity158 is now the @entity159 , and he just had one question for @entity9 : " do you happen to know how to fly this thing ? " ( oh , and apparently he 's got new kidneys			1
) so that was enough of an emotional roller coaster for an entire season 's worth of some shows			0
perhaps @entity19 's final words to the fans will help a little : " to the @entity171 , thanks a million , " he said			1
" you 're the best			0
and i 'll miss the madness			0
" ' @entity15 ' turns 50 and fans will never be the same			1
