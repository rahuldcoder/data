-- there is good reason to hope that @entity3 has been paying attention to @entity5 in the past year			2
in the event that it has not , it might fall on the @entity9 to give @entity3 a crash course			1
@entity3 is not the only small , open country whose recent actions have alienated much of the world			1
last june , the @entity16 military expelled @entity16 president @entity17 at gunpoint , unleashing a tragic series of events including human rights abuses , economic contraction and international isolation			0
late last month , @entity3 commandos killed nine activists seeking to breach the @entity27 maritime blockade with a humanitarian aid shipment , and the international community reacted with horror			0
after both events , officials in power in @entity3 and @entity16 resorted to similar narratives : the world misunderstood them and underestimated the threats they faced			1
these government accounts expanded the distance between each country and the world , demonstrating that real change will not come while the leaders promoting these narratives remain in power			1
in @entity16 , the coup prompted an unprecedented international rejection ; in @entity3 , international reproach has mounted over time , with the flotilla attack providing the most recent justification for @entity50 rhetoric			1
in both countries , the sitting governments explained that the world did not fully grasp the perilous , external threat they face -- in @entity16 , chavismo ( the left - wing ideology associated with @entity57 president @entity56 's government ) ; in @entity3 , the existential threat of @entity59 and @entity60			1
both countries , despite increasing international criticism , remain heavily dependent on @entity9 recognition and support			0
rejection from other countries hurts , but they can withstand it so long as they have backing from the @entity9			0
after last year 's coup , the @entity16 political establishment closed ranks , widely supporting @entity17 's illegal expulsion as a defense of the rule of law and the defeat of chavismo			2
then - de facto president @entity78 bristled at the international community 's condemnation , at one point declaring the secretary general of the @entity83 unwelcome in @entity16 as anything but a tourist and feeding @entity89 demonstrators @entity86 chants			0
to rally his supporters , @entity78 consistently painted @entity16 as the victim and refused to cede ground			0
the first signs of a similar reaction after the flotilla raid appeared quickly in @entity3 political discourse			1
the @entity3 government 's media office circulated a spoof video of flotilla activists singing " @entity101 , " for which they later apologized			2
now , @entity3 has rejected calls for an international inquiry into the raid , instead unilaterally appointing a panel that could focus attention on the activists ' bellicosity rather than @entity3 soldiers ' use of lethal force			0
but the actions of @entity114 's government can hardly be described as gaffes or mere blindness to world opinion			0
rather , they reflect a deliberate effort to drum up domestic support			0
such propaganda plays to the @entity3 suspicion that the entire world is , more or less secretly , anti-semitic , making it impossible for the jewish state to receive a fair hearing			2
by playing to these primal fears , rooted at the core of zionist historical consciousness , @entity114 is able to rally much of the nation behind him , while making himself virtually impervious to domestic criticism			0
@entity78 has not paid the price for his misdeeds , and neither will @entity114 , but @entity16 has and @entity3 will			1
while @entity78 received amnesty and a lifetime congressional salary , even a new election and the creation of a truth commission has not enabled @entity78 's successor , @entity140 , to re-establish ties with most of @entity142			0
as @entity140 's recent exclusion from international summits in @entity145 and @entity146 illustrates , @entity16 continues to suffer the economic and political effects of isolation			2
similarly , in @entity3 , the flotilla incident may have heralded the demise of @entity3 's only healthy relationship in the @entity153			2
reacting only hours after the incident , @entity155 's prime minister , @entity154 , said that @entity3 's actions were " totally contrary to the principles of international law , " branding them as " state terrorism			0
" @entity162 also immediately rejected @entity3 's commission , threatening to review its @entity3 policy if @entity3 does not accept an international investigation			0
like @entity78 , @entity114 can likely withstand the current crisis by turning his back on the storm of international criticism and celebrating @entity3 's avowed defense of its sovereignty against @entity173 extremists			0
@entity114 knows that @entity3 's backers in the @entity9 are much stronger than those of a country like @entity16 , where @entity178 's administration could be more assertive without provoking as much domestic backlash			1
right before a midterm @entity9 election , @entity114 is banking on the @entity178 administration not reacting strongly against @entity3			1
in fact , the @entity9 predictably shielded @entity3 from harsher @entity186 @entity185 condemnation and has expressed preliminary support for @entity3 's internal inquiry			1
the @entity9 ultimately played a similarly unhelpful role in @entity16 , removing pressure at a critical moment for @entity17 's reinstatement as a condition for recognizing the november elections			1
this act paved the way for the @entity198 's landslide rejection of @entity17 's restitution			0
much as last year 's crisis in @entity16 could not end with @entity78 in the presidential palace , it is hard to imagine peace coming to @entity3 with @entity114 in power			2
but the more important lesson for @entity3 that @entity114 should learn from the @entity16 crisis may be that unjustified state violence , and government defenses of these actions , prevents even a renewal in leadership from compensating for these errors			1
in short , @entity3 will pay a longer - term price for its government 's deplorable reaction to the flotilla attack			1
but , even if @entity114 fails to take note of the lessons issuing from @entity5 , president @entity178 should not			0
the @entity9 should change its tack , reject @entity3 's recent actions and remind it that a special relationship with the @entity9 is not carte blanche for human rights violations			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 and @entity227 .			2

@entity226 , @entity227 see similarities in @entity16 coup , @entity3 flotilla attack
after each , they say , both governments said world did *n't* appreciate threats they faced
such defenses expanded distance between each country and the world , pair says
they say @entity3 will pay price for its flotilla attack reaction , @entity9 should reject recent actions
