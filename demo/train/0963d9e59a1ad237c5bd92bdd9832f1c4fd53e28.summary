-- if @entity3 and @entity4 had a love child , his name would be @entity6			1
in the last century , the great critics of corrupt political language were @entity9 authors who wrote dystopian novels			2
in " 1984 , " @entity3 described a totalitarian society in which meaningless political language , dubbed @entity13 , veiled horrible truths			1
earlier , in " @entity16 , " @entity15 described toddlers conditioned in laboratories to be afraid of books			2
and in " @entity21 , " @entity20 imagined a world in which ultraviolent teens rampaged in a distinctive @entity26 - @entity25 patois that defined their alienation from society and authority			0
now in the 21st century , there is @entity6 's " truthiness " -- political half - truths , quarter - truths and what the website @entity35 describes as " @entity37 " prevarications			1
on his @entity40 show , " @entity39 , " he introduced " @entity42 , " a regular deconstruction of language contortion designed , in @entity3 's notion , to defend the indefensible			1
( one example : " a @entity50 , " as in , journalists should demand to investigate torture , but it 's not a perfect world			0
) it 's sharp political humor and a canny critique of @entity55 culture , language and iconography			1
and it 's helped the comic emerge as this nation 's court jester , licensed by the youthful cable tv audience to speak truth to power			1
such is @entity6 's power and influence that he has been invited to testify before @entity67 today on the issue of illegal immigration -- and to testify in character			1
it 's as if the @entity67 of the @entity72 years invited @entity73 to offer testimony by beeping his bicycle horn			2
@entity6 has long been on to something important about the nature of our political discourse at the beginning of a new postmodern millennium : that ideology has become the lens through which @entity55 found their particular truth , let the evidence be damned			1
as a caricature of @entity88 's @entity87 , he has turned deconstruction of the culture wars into an art form , adopting the slogans and symbols of @entity55 's ideologues , even as he reveals their emptiness			2
of course , during the last century , there were always comic voices -- from @entity99 to @entity100 to @entity101 to @entity102 -- who could be counted on to deflate the pretensions of the rich and powerful using their own words			0
but cable television has created a different breed of comic cat with vast media reach			0
and on @entity88 , @entity110 offers himself up as a " rodeo clown " ( his words ) , a character who embodies the disaffection and alienation of the right , but whose acolytes experience him as real enough to follow him in the thousands to the @entity118 for a rally			2
@entity120 insists that his " @entity126 " is comedy entertainment and not journalism , and yet it has become the main source of political news for millions			0
even as president @entity127 is seen by some to have lost his campaign mojo , @entity120 and @entity6 plan their own @entity130 rally , making them arguably the most potent antidote to the blustery right			2
is it possible we are reaching the point in political history when a fictional character can be elected to office ? viewers and fans should remember what 's real about all this and what 's not			0
i was reminded of this firsthand when i encountered the @entity6 comic persona during one of the 2004 presidential conventions in which he declared himself a worthy presidential candidate because of his humble origins			0
he was a descendant , he said , of " goat turd farmers from @entity154			0
" as producers explain to guests on " @entity39 , " it is not their job to be funny , but to act as foil for the self - important and clueless cable talk show host			0
the guest tries to disabuse @entity6 of his ridiculous view of politics and the world , an effort that never works , of course			0
what happens when @entity6 is questioned by members of @entity67 promises to be a comic hall of mirrors in which illusion and allusion , reflection and deflection , truthiness and reality collide and converge			1
members of @entity67 might treat the spectacle as entertainment , but they would be wise to look a level deeper , to see that the followers of @entity6 's circus may one day cast off their ironic pose and step up to cast their votes			1
when i was the age of @entity6 's legion of fans , i turned to the novels of @entity3 , @entity15 and @entity20 to sharpen my skepticism toward the language of those in power			1
such fiction is likely to wane in influence in an era when so many read less and care less			0
in its place is something quite different but , in its own way , quite good : comedy and satire shining a disinfecting light on the language of scoundrels			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			0

@entity210 says @entity6 is heir to social comment *tradition* of @entity3 , @entity15
comedian 's sway is so great , he says , he 's testifying in character on immigration to @entity67
he says @entity6 ( and @entity110 too ) knows @entity55 find " truth " through own ideological lens
@entity210 : but @entity6 uses power of satire to shine disinfecting light on language of scoundrels
