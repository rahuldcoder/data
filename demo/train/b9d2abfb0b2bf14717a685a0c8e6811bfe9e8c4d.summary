-- i came to @entity2 as a transfer student in the fall of 2004			1
i did three years of computer engineering in @entity6 and then transferred to @entity7			1
on july 2 , 2005 , just a month before graduation , a guy who lived on the first floor of my apartment building set fire to his place			1
he wrapped his baby in a blanket , put the baby in a car seat , put the car seat in the closet and then poured gasoline over the apartment with his baby and wife still in it			1
he then set the whole place on fire and left			1
the fire started at 4:30 a.m. my roommate and i could not jump out with the balcony and windows engulfed in flames			2
as my roommate fell unconscious in front of me , i started running down the stairs and passed out			2
a firefighter found my body and pulled me out			2
as the paramedics were taking me to the hospital , i heard one say , " this guy is 95 % burned ; he does n't have a chance			2
" at that moment , i thought about my family and how i came to @entity2 to get good education , and now i did n't have a chance to live			1
i was soon unconscious and later woke up in the @entity45 burn unit after four months in an induced coma			2
the man 's wife , his baby and my best friend and roommate , @entity51 , died in the fire			1
after seven months in @entity53 , i was transferred to @entity54 in @entity55 for my rehabilitation			0
i do n't have any family in @entity2 so i lived in a nursing home			1
i stayed there for 2Â½ years while i went through reconstructive surgeries to regain range of motion in my arms			1
for more than five years , i went through an intense therapy program			1
i wore a face mask for three years and pressure garments on my entire body ; i wore dynamic splints on my hands , wrists and elbows to increase range of motion , daily dressing changes to my wounds and performing hourly exercises to restore function in all of my joints			2
i wanted to get an mba so i studied in my extra time			2
i scheduled my @entity79 , or @entity79 , exam and got a six - hour pass from the nursing home to take the test			0
i scored 700 on my @entity79 and got accepted into the @entity84 in @entity55			0
i wanted to go to a part - time program since i did n't know how much of a course load i would be able to take			2
everyone gets their acceptance letter mailed to his home ; i got my letter mailed to the nursing home			0
my doctors did everything they could to help me regain range of motion in my arms			0
even after 54 surgeries , i am still very limited			1
i do n't have any finger movement in my left hand and very limited finger movement in my right hand			0
i type with one finger			0
i rely on various adaptive equipments to perform my activities of daily living			0
this horrific crime not only left me with disabilities but also interfered with my visa			0
i have not seen most of my family in @entity6 since the accident seven years ago , because i am still waiting on a green card			1
my sister has been denied a visa four times in trying to visit me			0
i have been able to come out of this tragedy because of the values that my parents instilled in me and the help from my occupational therapist			1
my parents taught me the value of education , hard work and perseverance			2
they taught me to be content in life no matter what the circumstances			0
they taught me that " we can always find someone who is in worse condition than we are in			0
so be thankful for what you have			0
" i call my occupational therapist , @entity132 , my guardian angel			1
@entity134 sent her into my life when i was in the deepest and darkest pit of my life			0
she took me to church every sunday while i stayed in the nursing home , which brought some normalcy into my life			0
today , i can live independently because of her hard work			0
after 3Â½ years , i graduated with my mba on may 13			1
i am now seeking a job in finance			1
to give back to the community , i volunteered in the @entity147 therapy department between many of my surgeries			1
i still visit the @entity147 burn unit and talk to other burn patients about my experience			0
i also lecture at @entity153 to occupational therapy students about all the adaptive equipment i use to live independently			1
i have had some wonderful people in my life who have helped me in my journey			0
i plan to do the same for other people .			0
