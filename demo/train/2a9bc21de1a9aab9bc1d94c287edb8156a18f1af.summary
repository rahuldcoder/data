-- those who were in @entity4 's @entity3 stadium saturday night for the @entity8 club 's @entity6 clash with @entity9 say the atmosphere felt like a long " good bye			1
" @entity13 waves to supporters during @entity4 's match with @entity9 on saturday			1
as @entity13 entered the pitch he took a long look around and then beat his fist on his chest -- a gesture commonly used by footballers to display their loyalty to supporters			1
was he saying @entity4 will always be in his heart ? or was he simply giving everyone a heartfelt " saludo " ? @entity13 , @entity4 's @entity27 superstar and a former world footballer of the year , is reported to be the subject of a $ 150 million bid from super-rich @entity32 club @entity31 that would smash football 's transfer word record			1
@entity4 's supporters are on @entity13 's side , because they believe it is club officials who want to sell him			1
@entity38 , no longer the club 's president but the man in charge when it comes to make major decisions , said this week that it was difficult to ask someone who earns 10 million euros a year to turn down an offer of 15 million euros , adding " it 's a difficult offer to refuse			2
" @entity38 is counting his own money			0
@entity8 's prime minister is also the country 's richest man and he remains businessman at heart			0
he purchased @entity13 in 2003 for $ 7.5 million ( roughly 8 million euros at the time )			2
selling him on would generate a massive profit on his investment -- in cash and paid up front			0
privately , most @entity4 supporters would probably agree with @entity38 's reasoning			2
after all , when so much money is at stake , your head as much as your heart must decide , and the ball at this point is with @entity13 rather than club officials			1
still supporters displayed a mix of anger and sarcasm on saturday evening			0
" @entity78 " read one banner , while another said : " i thought the devil could not sell its soul , but i was wrong , " referring to @entity4 's devil 's head logo			2
" @entity38 , @entity84 " read another one , referring to @entity80 , the city 's other top team and @entity4 's archrivals			0
in a choreographed protest 30 minutes into saturday 's match , hundreds of supporters occupying a section of the central stand waved 50 - euro notes towards @entity4 president @entity91 , sitting just above them			1
@entity91 did n't react , but perhaps thought to himself that the money was n't even enough to pay @entity13 's wages for a day			2
the 26 - year - old will reportedly earn around $ 500,000 a week at @entity31			1
likewise , the 5,000 supporters who signed a petition to keep the @entity27 star in @entity4 would have to pay $ 100 a week each to match the offer			1
a single banner criticized the player			0
" i belong to money " it read , referring to the " i belong to @entity105 " t - shirt @entity13 has displayed occasionally after scoring a goal			0
the banner stayed up only a few minutes but then mysteriously disappeared			0
even on this emotional evening at the @entity3 there was no room for criticism of the fans ' @entity27 hero			0
at the end of the game @entity13 's teammates hugged him and he waved again towards the supporters			1
was he saying goodbye to them -- or to a $ 150 million move to @entity118 ?			0

@entity4 fans *express* anger over @entity13 's *rumored* $ 150m move to @entity31
fans wave banknotes at club officials , display " @entity78 " banners
@entity27 waved to fans , beat chest with fist , at start and end of match
@entity4 have admitted 26 - year - old could leave club in a world record deal
