this month , one of the least merciful presidents in the history of the @entity3 granted 13 pardons and eight commutations of sentence			1
the grants moved president @entity9 's overall mark past the administrations of @entity11 ( who served only one term ) , @entity13 ( who died of pneumonia after serving only 30 days ) , @entity15 ( who was fatally wounded by an assassin after serving only four months ) and @entity18			1
the @entity19 complained that , when it came to the pardon power , there was just " no excuse " for @entity9 's " lack of compassion " and encouraged him to " do much more			1
" the @entity26 called the pardons " a step " and hoped the president would " continue to exercise his clemency powers			1
" meanwhile , the @entity32 , a libertarian think tank , lamented the " drought " of pardons in the @entity9 administration and called the recent grants " mingy and belated			1
" conservative columnist @entity37 wrote that it was " about time " @entity9 acted , and even tossed out the possibility / hope that he might " do it again soon			1
" while it is true that @entity9 's grants included no one comparable to @entity44 , or @entity45 , much less president @entity46 , the intensity and commonality of reactions is noteworthy			1
political executives -- presidents and governors -- may not be quite aware of or in tune with it just yet , but the times , they are a-changing			1
no one is clamoring for violent criminals to be yanked out of prisons and tossed into the streets to wreak havoc on society			2
no one is lusting for the considered judgment of judges and juries to be whimsically overturned by politicians leaving office and , in the process , sidestepping accountability			2
but , increasingly , there is recognition that budgets are tight , and prisons are both overcrowded and expensive			2
the recidivism of those who spend time in prisons and exit without anything like serious rehabilitation is also costly			2
@entity79 ' recent recognition of the failure ( if not outright unjust nature ) of sentencing laws appears , to many , as still yet another indicator that there is consensus regarding the status of the so - called war on drugs : it has not worked out very well			0
judges have complained loudly about mandatory minimum and three - strikes laws which have limited their ability to tailor punishments to fit crimes -- a basic notion of justice			0
public opinion polls also suggest @entity3 are increasingly uncomfortable with over-criminalization in the law			1
the pardon power will always carry an inherent political " risk , " because no one can perfectly predict the future behavior of recipients and everyone 's judgment can be second - guessed , if not mischaracterized			0
informed persons know @entity110 did not " pardon " @entity111 and @entity112 did not " pardon " @entity114			0
but , of course , executives can not always survive political storms with the support and encouragement of informed persons			0
nonetheless , the @entity120 considered the pardon power an integral part of our system of separation of powers and checks and balances			0
its presence in the @entity131 is premised on the notion that @entity79 and the @entity133 are not always perfect			0
anyone care to disagree ? it simply follows that , if the pardon power is being neglected or abused , then government is not doing what it was meant to do			0
@entity140 furthermore noted , in the @entity141 , that the criminal codes of nations have an almost natural tendency toward over-severity			0
for that reason , he argued , there should be easy access to mercy			0
yes , you read that right , " easy access , " or , in other words , something very different than what is going on in the @entity9 administration			1
the fortunate thing is , presidents and governors can very easily minimize the political " risk " of pardoning by granting pardons regularly , consistently , throughout terms , as opposed to , very questionably , at the " last minute			1
" while @entity163 pardons may make some feel warm and fuzzy , they also send a message that is more counterproductive than anything			1
they seem to say mercy is an afterthought , or worse , a gift , that may or may not be deserved			2
the fact of the matter is the majority of individual acts of executive clemency in our lifetime have been pardons , which simply restored the civil rights of the recipients			2
no one was sprung from jail			0
violent criminals were not tossed into the streets			0
judges and juries were not overturned			0
recipients have typically committed minor offenses , many involving no incarceration whatsoever , and usually , many years if not decades before pardon			0
@entity192 background checks documented they had integrated back into society as law - abiding productive members			0
their pardons were not " gifts " so much as they were well deserved recognition			2
have these pardons been high - wire maneuvers ? have they required presidents to spend precious political capital ? not at all			1
@entity9 has granted 52 pardons to date			1
there is a much better than average chance that readers can not name a single recipient			0
so , why ca n't @entity9 restore the civil rights of more applicants ? why does n't he ? there is no obvious answer to that question , save lack of care and concern			1
where is the president who said his religion teaches him the importance of redemption and second chances ? where is the hope ?			2

president @entity9 has granted 52 pardons to date ; @entity210 granted almost 200
@entity231 : @entity9 is one of the least merciful presidents in @entity3 history
he says @entity163 pardons may seem warm and fuzzy , but it makes them seem like a gift
@entity231 : instead of last minute pardons , politicians should grant pardons regularly
