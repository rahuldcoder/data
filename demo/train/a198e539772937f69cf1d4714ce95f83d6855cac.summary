-- beyond skateboards , @entity2 and hippies , @entity1 has a trendsetting streak of a different kind			1
the state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country			1
@entity1 was first to require smog checks for clean air , pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws			1
while these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule , they 've often become standard practice in other states			0
the @entity20 was first to ban smoking in workplaces , bars and restaurants in 1998			0
now similar rules exist throughout the country			0
some advocates tout the state as a forward - thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states			1
" there have been progressive legislations in tobacco , environment and obesity prevention , " said @entity32 , a lecturer at the @entity33			2
" in some respect , the rest of the country looks to @entity1 as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives			2
" but some critics liken the @entity20 to a nanny state			2
@entity1 has 151,002 health and safety laws			1
" it never ends , " said @entity48 , who works in public affairs in @entity50			0
" every year , several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives			0
" starting in january , 760 new @entity1 laws went into effect -- for example , the importing of shark fins is prohibited , student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury , teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden			1
there 's a perception that @entity1 has " more folks who are health - oriented and more health - minded , " said @entity32 , former director of the @entity72			1
it 's not just workout fanatics hanging out at @entity75 , @entity79 members hiking mountains or the uber - health - conscious touting organic foods			1
@entity1 in general tend to have healthier habits , ranking 10th for physical activity , fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states , according to @entity88			1
@entity1 have a stake in their health and the environment , because they want to enjoy the state 's natural landscape , said several people interviewed for the article			1
" what brings many people to @entity1 is the climate and the culture , " said @entity96 , @entity1 's secretary for environmental protection			1
" that means people who do come here have an interest in preserving ... a beautiful environment , clean air and clean water			2
" the willingness to innovate in health laws is part of the @entity1 's culture , said @entity112 , founder and executive director of @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity1			1
" you see that in technology innovation in @entity2 , there 's a lot of sharing of ideas and resources that lead to major breakthroughs			0
" a similar vibe exists in public health because there is a high concentration of medical , public health and law schools and organizations exchanging ideas , she said			1
since @entity1 started allowing ballot initiatives in 1911 , its voters have swept in many several pioneering health laws			1
in 1986 , the state 's voters passed a ballot initiative requiring information on products if they contain chemicals known to cause cancer , birth defects or reproductive harm			0
products like electrical cords and @entity148 - style lamps carry statements : " warning : this product contains lead , a chemical known to the @entity1 to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm			1
" one of @entity1 's biggest examples of its influence on public health law is tobacco regulation			1
in 1988 , voters approved a proposition to become the first state to tax cigarettes to fund a tobacco control program			1
ten years later , @entity1 banned smoking in public places such as trains , planes , buses , workplaces and restaurants			1
now , about half of the states have similar policies about smoking in public places			0
@entity1 became a guide for developing anti-smoking policies , said @entity178 , who formerly served as the acting director of the @entity181 's @entity180			2
the state also has a long history of limiting air pollution			0
@entity1 was the first state to ban a chemical used in laundromats called perchloroethylene , prohibit leaded gasoline , require smog checks and reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases			2
the state 's air resource board passed another rule in january requiring reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and putting more zero - emission vehicles on the road			2
@entity1 , home to more than 37 million people and the world 's ninth - largest economy , has major clout			1
" it 's a large and powerful state , it can challenge national industries and has done so , " said @entity178 , professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the @entity33 at @entity205			0
in certain cases , @entity1 laws have gone too far , according to the courts			2
last year , the @entity210 struck down a @entity1 law that would have banned selling violent video games to children			0
the state asserted that it had a legal obligation to protect children from graphic interactive images , but the court ruled the law violated the @entity220			0
" as far as red states and blue states go , it 's probably the largest blue state with more progressive attitudes towards issues around public health , " @entity178 said			1
" and some cities , @entity229 and @entity230 , have been passing some of the laws at municipal level , that lays the ground for state legislation			0
" @entity1 's cities often grab headlines with health - oriented initiatives			1
the @entity238 recently passed a law requiring all adult film workers to use condoms to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases			0
pornography filmmakers have responded by threatening to move elsewhere			0
@entity245 , located in northern @entity1 , became the first to ban fast - food restaurants from handing out give free trinkets with their kid 's meals in 2010			2
@entity229 quickly passed a similar law and @entity252 's leaders have also indicated interest			0
but @entity1 does not rank as one of the healthiest states , according to @entity88			0
it ranks in the middle , at 24 , when the health of its residents is compared with other states			0
@entity1 came in as the worst for air pollution and near the top in cancer deaths ( sixth ) , infant mortality ( fifth ) and occupational fatalities ( fourth )			2
because @entity1 houses more than 10 % of the @entity267 population , it may not be fair to compare a state with such a huge , diverse population with one that 's more homogenous and smaller , like @entity272 , which ranks as the healthiest state			1
" the amount of cultural and income diversity in the state , the huge size of low - income population puts health equity to test here , " said @entity274 , a lawyer who specializes in public health issues			1
" we are not the healthiest state despite innovations ; we have challenges that we embrace and try to offer solutions			0
" @entity48 , author of " @entity288 : tales from the @entity292 " said all the regulations have hurt @entity1 's economy			2
the state has lost manufacturing jobs and companies because of too much regulation , he said			0
for years , @entity1 has faced budget shortfalls , and its governor , @entity299 , is now calling for tax increases in sales and high - end income			2
" it 's a love - hate , " @entity48 said about his views of @entity1			2
" there 's so much to the government , it drives me a little crazy			0
" @entity274 said people who blame regulations for economic woes do n't see the bigger picture			0
" people love to beat up on the nanny state and point a finger at regulation , " said @entity274			0
for example , she said that not regulating air quality means more people would have health problems such as heart disease and asthma			1
" if we do n't do something , we are costing the state untold billions of dollars , " she said			0
" it 'd be worse without protection			0

@entity1 led several public health efforts in tobacco control , air quality
residents tend to be health - conscious because of culture , environment
critics say the state *over-regulates* , *stifling* freedom and economy
several metrics show laws do n't translate into healthy population
