-- downgrade -- the most feared word in @entity3 's financial lexicon			1
most attention friday was focused on @entity5 -- @entity3 's second largest economy -- as @entity7 's cut its rating on @entity5 sovereign debt			1
but the debt of several other countries also received the @entity12 , including @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , whose debt rating was cut by one notch from its @entity20 status			2
@entity16 's inclusion might come as a surprise to those who do n't follow the bond markets			1
its economy -- by @entity3 standards -- is thriving			0
the governor of @entity16 's @entity29 , @entity28 , described the downgrade as " politically motivated " and asserted : " the structure of the @entity16 economy is well - balanced ; output has been evolving dynamically at above - average rates ; @entity16 has a sizeable current account surplus ; and it is the @entity36 country with the lowest unemployment rate [ just 4 per cent ]			1
" but @entity16 has two problems			0
its budget deficit has ballooned and now stands at 4.6 percent of gdp ( although by @entity3 standards that 's toward the lower end of the spectrum			2
) finance minister @entity43 told @entity16 television sunday that health spending , pension obligations and the state railway system are in the crosshairs as the government looks for annual budget savings in excess of $ 2 billion			2
opposition parties say the government has been slow to act -- knocking investor confidence			0
as in the @entity56 and elsewhere in @entity3 there is fierce debate in @entity16 over the balance between tax increases and spending cuts to reduce the deficit			1
secondly , @entity16 ca n't pick its neighbors			0
to the south is @entity13 , @entity16 's second largest trading partner , where the new technocratic government of @entity65 is embarking on an austerity program and where the economy is struggling to avoid recession			1
@entity16 banks do a lot of business in @entity13 and a lot in central and south - eastern @entity3			1
another neighbor is @entity74 , where the government recently forced local banks to let millions of homeowners repay foreign currency loans at below market rates			0
that 's hurting @entity74 banks because millions of householders took out mortgages in @entity85 francs in recent years and now ca n't keep up with repayments			2
and when @entity74 banks sneeze , @entity16 banks catch cold			2
they have loans worth nearly $ 50 billion in @entity74 alone			0
last year , one major @entity16 bank with considerable exposure in @entity74 failed the @entity36 's " stress tests " -- and has since been selling assets to fortify its balance sheet			1
the @entity16 government may have to pump more capital into the country 's main banks , but for now @entity16 banking officials tell @entity0 the banks can probably raise the capital they need to pass the next round of " stress tests " held by the @entity103			1
even so , @entity29 governor @entity28 acknowledges that measures need to be taken to " ensure the sustainability of the business model of @entity16 banks active in central and eastern @entity3			2
" there is only so much that the @entity16 can do			0
much depends on @entity74 's tortured negotiations with the @entity110 and the @entity36 over a bailout for its stricken finances			0
all three ratings agencies have reduced @entity74 's credit - worthiness to " junk " status			1
the chief @entity74 negotiator , @entity117 , is on a tour of @entity3 capitals this week , and sources in @entity121 say he will meet the @entity16 finance minister and @entity29 governor on thursday			1
it should be an interesting exchange of views			0
the @entity16 and the @entity127 have been highly critical of " populist " measures by the @entity74 government led by @entity130 that have hurt the banking sector			1
but @entity130 is under pressure at home not to yield to international pressure			0
at the weekend , protesters took to the streets of @entity137 with banners demanding " @entity139			0
" some commentators have begun talking of @entity74 as the " @entity141 of eastern @entity3			2
" @entity143 ' @entity142 blogged last week : " once again a small , relatively unknown economy is dominating the headlines and causing a massive headache for the @entity3 authorities			0
" we 've been there before			0
in may 1931 @entity16 's largest bank , @entity150 , collapsed suddenly			1
it had built up an unenviable portfolio of bad loans , but they were hidden from public view			0
as @entity16 raced to retrieve their savings , and governments squabbled over a rescue package , panic spread quickly to other @entity3 countries			2
banks in the @entity161 and @entity162 collapsed			0
some economic historians believe @entity165 's failure triggered what would become known as the @entity167 .			1

@entity16 's credit downgrade hidden behind @entity5 but could have wide *repercussions*
the country has low unemployment but is exposed to financial risk in @entity13 and @entity74
as in the @entity56 and across @entity3 there is fierce debate over balancing tax increases and spending cuts to reduce the deficit
some economic historians believe it was a banking failure in @entity16 that triggered what would become known as the @entity167
