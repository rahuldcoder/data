@entity0 , @entity1 -- i am surfing the internet from @entity6 's garden			1
that sentence implies several minor miracles			0
the fact that i am in the country at all is surprising			0
i was deported for my reporting on the repression here ... twice			1
now i have been invited back with the @entity15 press pack , my past " sins " apparently forgotten			2
to be here at this most famous house is strangely moving			0
i 'd driven past it on numerous occasions when @entity6 was under house arrest -- the secret police watching the entrance , whispering into their radios , as they saw a car full of @entity26 approaching			1
you could n't even stop on this part of @entity0 in those days , let alone wander around the manicured garden of " the lady			1
" now i am waiting for her most famous visitor yet -- @entity34 president @entity33 will be stopping here for a chat			1
read more : @entity33 to urge @entity37 not to extinguish ' flickers of progress ' it is the historic culmination of three years of hard diplomacy			1
the @entity34 policy of sanctions was clearly failing : punishing the people and leaving the elite free to plunder the rich resources of this benighted country			2
in 2009 , the @entity15 initiated a review of policy towards the country it still stubbornly calls @entity37			2
it resulted in a significant shift toward @entity37			2
but few dared to predict how quickly events would move			0
officials here are frank about their astonishment			0
do n't forget it was only just over two years ago that @entity6 was still under house arrest and the whole road map to democracy seemed a sham			1
now she is not only free , but meeting leaders around the world			0
she is an elected member of parliament , and president @entity66 has even talked about her one day being a future leader			2
it 's important not to get too carried away			0
poverty is still endemic , 25 % of the country does n't have electricity , healthcare is parlous , ethnic conflict still stalks verdant hills in the north and what amounts to ethnic cleansing of @entity78 continues in the west			0
the @entity80 still controls politics and business			0
hundreds of political prisoners languish behind bars			0
but there is something in the air here that has been so desperately lacking in the past : hope			0
read more : @entity37 's president grants prisoners amnesty its enticing scent is wafting through the carefully - tended roses of @entity6 's garden			1
and there 's something else in the air here too : wifi ! in a country where internet access is restricted , slow and very expensive , the fact that i can email photos and text wirelessly in a garden -- in @entity37 -- is incredible			1
let me say it again : i am surfing the internet from @entity6 's garden .			1
