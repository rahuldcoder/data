-- how can it be that we are firmly into the 21st century and reading claims that birth control pills can cause prostate cancer and abort babies ? or , my personal favorite , that a woman can be considered pregnant before her egg unites with a sperm ? such falsehoods are being touted not by yahoos but by educated conservatives who , in growing numbers , choose to ignore what science tells them			1
according to a paper in a recent @entity20 , conservatives with at least a bachelor 's degree have , over the last several decades , lost their faith in science to an amazing degree			1
although the paper does n't cite advances in contraception specifically , they are clearly one victim of this disaffection			1
our country 's top health agency , the @entity31 , counts contraception as one of the 10 greatest health achievements of the 20th century			1
yet recently : -- a state legislator from @entity36 , opposed to insurance companies being required to pay for birth control , called attention to a report suggesting that birth control pills cause prostate cancer			1
( certain drugs in those pills become waste and eventually pass into the environment , according to the report , exposing men to carcinogens			0
) the representative based her statement on findings that originally appeared in the @entity53 , findings that one author of the study later characterized as only a hypothesis , and were seriously questioned in a subsequent @entity53 article			0
-- some members of @entity60 , in their attempt to derail legislation requiring insurers , including the insurers of some religious organizations , to cover birth control , falsely argued that @entity67 , the " morning after " pill taken after sex in order to avoid pregnancy , causes abortions			1
it does not , nor do other methods of contraception , @entity76 , president of the @entity77 , pointed out in a letter to the editor in @entity80			2
" the definition of contraception is to prevent pregnancy , which occurs at implantation , " he wrote			2
the morning - after pill is often confused with another drug , @entity88 , which , he said , does induce abortion and is therefore not considered contraception			1
-- @entity93 gov. @entity92 signed into law a bill prohibiting abortions that occur 20 weeks after a woman 's last period begins			0
( this is in contrast to starting the 20 - week count about two weeks later , when fertilization likely occurs			0
) as @entity104 notes in @entity105 , @entity93 conservatives , in effect , said that women could be pregnant before egg and sperm unite			2
apparently they were dozing off during ninth - grade biology			0
not all political conservatives are @entity112 , of course			2
but there are proportionately more of them than there used to be , according to the review article			0
for that piece , @entity118 , a postdoctoral fellow at the @entity119 , analyzed information from the @entity122 , conducted every year since 1972 by the @entity123 ( @entity123 ) at the @entity124			0
he found that in 1974 , the year @entity126 @entity125 became president , 48 % of conservatives trusted science , a higher proportion , interestingly , than found among liberals or moderates			1
by 2010 , however , that number had fallen to 34 % , while the degree of trust among moderates and liberals remained stable			0
of particular note : confidence dropped among conservatives who held bachelor 's degrees , not those who only finished high school			2
@entity118 theorized that because educated conservatives are more politically engaged than other voting blocs , they are more likely to seek information that conforms to their ideology			2
as the @entity148 , writing about @entity118 's work , pointed out , some of them have big money to spend spreading their ideas			0
" right - wing think tanks , funded by corporate interests to undermine the scientific consensus on such expensive - to - fix phenomena as climate change , have proliferated , as have conservative cable - tv networks , blogs and radio talk shows , " the @entity148 noted			2
" these outlets are talking to a well - educated audience			0
and they 're presenting a very one - sided view of scientific issues			2
" @entity118 also wrote about the influence of the religious right , " which rejects scientific contradictions of religious teachings on such issues as evolution and stem - cell research , and the growing use of science to inform public policy in such areas as environmental protection			1
" " conservatives , ever wary of government interference with the free market , started to resent the scientists			2
... rather than debate remedies , they have turned on science itself			0
... ( they ) really have their own subculture , complete with ontological claims about what the world is about			0
" here 's what the world is really about when it comes to using birth control : women , notably millennials , the largest generation ever , are pursuing higher education , jobs and careers , having sex and bearing children , all according to a timetable that works best for them , their partners and their babies			1
they could n't do this if birth control was n't accessible , affordable and safe			1
demonizing it amounts to telling these women to throw out their briefcases and take up their vacuum cleaners			0
conservative opposition to contraception has a last - gasp ring to it , and most @entity218 know that			1
one indication is a poll recently published by the @entity222 , a think tank supported by a broad spectrum of scientists and religious experts			0
the poll showed a majority of @entity218 , including a majority of @entity228 , believe that most employers should be required to provide their employees with health care plans that cover contraception at no cost			0
another sign of change is the perceptible ease with which young men talk about and support contraception , including methods being developed for them			0
@entity240 , a 23 - year - old policy intern working in @entity241 , says he looks forward to the day when male birth control , in various testing stages around the country , goes on the market			1
" my generation has always had contraception , " he says			1
" it was a part of our sex education and is a part of our relationships			0
we are just beginning to get engaged in the politics , and the fight against it is a losing battle			1
" the opinions used in this commentary are solely those of @entity259 .			1

@entity261 : conservatives are choosing to ignore science
@entity259 : some myths : contraception causes abortion and prostate cancer
they reject scientific contradictions of their religious teachings , she says
@entity259 : opposition to birth control is a losing battle as new generation grows up
