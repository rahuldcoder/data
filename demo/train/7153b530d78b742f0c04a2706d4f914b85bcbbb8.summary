-- by definition , a model is an archetype , an example to emulate			0
within those standards , @entity5 is a model of imperfection			1
the 22 - year - old was born with albinism , a congenital disorder that results in the production of little to no pigment in the skin , hair and eyes			1
the condition affects an estimated 1 in 17,000 people in the @entity19 , according to the @entity20 , and puts people at risk for persecution in some parts of the world , according to the @entity26 and @entity26			0
during this @entity27 , which runs until september 12 , @entity5 appeared in presentations for brands @entity29 and monsieur @entity31			1
he previously walked the runway in @entity33 and appeared in music videos for @entity35 and @entity36 ©			1
his most anticipated project is an upcoming short film entitled " @entity39 " with @entity40			0
@entity5 , who describes his look as " euphoric , " is one of a growing number of anti-cookie - cutter models			1
he said his smile " is n't the prettiest , " but illuminating ; his face is " very disoriented , " but edgy			0
" i challenge photographers , " he said			0
interactive : the look of @entity27 @entity5 said his condition does n't confine or define him -- it has just always been there			1
the 6 - foot - 1 model came into the world the same way he did the modeling industry : in an unlikely fashion			0
@entity5 's mom gave birth to him on the highway on the way to the hospital			1
" the nickname my parents always called me was @entity64 , " @entity5 said with a laugh			1
but growing up in the @entity66 borough of @entity67 , @entity5 said he was called everything from " @entity70 " to " @entity69 " to " white bread			1
" in seventh grade , the teasing culminated when a boy stabbed him in the back six times with a pen			0
" i was always the outcast , but a confident outcast , " @entity5 said			1
" i just had to accept it			0
i 'm going to be me ; either you 're going to accept it or you 're not			0
" @entity5 , in part , credits his confidence to his mother , who never dwelled on his differences			1
" it 's really weird to say , but i never thought about my skin being weird			1
i just knew that 's what it was			2
i never asked myself why i did n't look like my parents , " @entity5 said			1
" my mother has showed me you have no fear			0
you let people judge you , but who gives a fâ € ” k ? " to him , beauty is confidence			2
while the runways this week continue to be dominated by waif - like bodies , angular faces and symmetrical , round eyes , @entity5 arrived on the scene just as the modeling industry is abuzz about what it means to be beautiful			1
@entity27 's first plus - sized designer the @entity111 recently declared it the season of the quirky model			1
" it girl " of the moment @entity121 sports full , bushy brows and self - deprecating , goofy @entity117 to match			0
she also suffers from psoriasis , an autoimmune disease that often results in splotchy red patches on the skin			0
a recent flare - up served as an accessory to a red @entity130 gown during @entity131 in february 2013			0
" it only happened during @entity27 ! " @entity121 told @entity133			1
" which is , of course , the worst time of the year for me to be covered in scabs			0
psoriasis is an autoimmune disease , and i 'm sensitive			0
@entity140 ( @entity141 ) saw me before the @entity143 show at 3 a.m. , when i was being painted by people to cover the scabs			0
" meanwhile , @entity146 with her " bee - stung lips " and gap teeth glided down the runway for top designers @entity151 and @entity152 , among others , during @entity27			1
@entity156 model @entity155 's otherworldly eyes pierce the cameras , while @entity158 continues to push limits with crossover between menswear and womenswear			2
@entity164 rocks pink hair , while @entity168 sports a short , grunge haircut -- and challenges the notion that models must be in their late teens by continuing to work at age 32			1
high fashion , minus the labels some argue there is n't enough racial diversity in modeling , such as model - turned - activist @entity179 , who sent a memo to @entity27 organizers on behalf of the @entity182 , an advocacy group that champions diversity on the runway			1
" eyes are on an industry that season after season watches fashion design houses consistently use one or no models of color , " @entity179 wrote to the @entity185 , as well as to the @entity186 and the governing fashion week bodies for @entity188 and @entity131			2
" no matter the intention , the result is racism , " she continues ; the memo went on to call out specific designers who featured zero or only a couple of black models during their last season			2
according to @entity204 and @entity205 , two of the most influential casting directors during @entity27 , one part of casting is a designer 's aesthetic : does it make sense to put a rock ' n ' roll girl in a romantic gown ? but the majority is based on instinct			1
" when an ' it girl ' arrives , to an untrained eye , you would n't give her a second glance , " @entity205 told @entity0 after @entity216 debuted its spring collection at @entity27 , where models were juxtaposed with flashy sports cars and @entity220 and @entity221 watched from the front row			1
" models are supposed to be aspirational , unreal characters , " @entity205 said			2
" the fact that they are abnormally tall , perfectly proportioned and have amazing skin , it 's because we 're creating a picture			2
it entices someone to buy something			0
" @entity239 said that when he and @entity205 make casting decisions , there are a limited number of diverse models			2
they have seen a growing number of @entity248 models , as that area of the world has become one of the fastest growing markets for luxury goods			2
" all the shows essentially want the best of the best , " @entity239 said			0
in a statement , the @entity186 said the lack of ethnic models is also a multitiered problem , from who the agencies decide to sign to what designers request			2
" the @entity186 does not organize model castings for @entity267 , although , as its governing body , strongly asserts that all participating designers should recognize that @entity270 is one of the most multicultural cities in the world and should consider reflecting this demographic at their shows and presentations , " it said in its response to the @entity182 's memo			2
this season , @entity205 and @entity239 say that personality and quirk appeals because of the intensity of model turnover			0
during the era of the supermodel , the faces of @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 and @entity286 transcended the runway -- often into mainstream media -- for years			1
now , a model 's look can be in and out of vogue in a matter of a few seasons			2
a day in the life of a model it can be a matter of a model having the right look at the right time , whether heroin chic , like @entity141 in the 1990s , or the androgynous look spurred by @entity305 in the mid- 2000s			0
" the world has to want what that girl offers at that exact time , " @entity239 said			0
but @entity239 and @entity205 try not to cross the line from quirk into novelty			0
" there 's a fine line between an interesting event and a spectacle , " @entity239 said			2
" it 's a spectacle when it becomes more about people wanting to identify with the strange			0
" @entity5 , the model with albinism , is a tricky one to cast , @entity205 said			1
" that guy is unbelievably good - looking in an unbelievably bizarre way			0
but many designers have n't thought that way , " he said			0
@entity5 summed up his attitude with a hashtag he uses to his growing social media following , # @entity328 , which he says promotes a level of comfort with yourself			1
he started it to raise albinism awareness , but has since expanded the meaning to just loving who you are			0
" it 's the @entity338 generation , " @entity5 said			1
" kids are becoming muses because they understand that what it takes to be successful is to be desirable and confident			0
" follow @entity343 and on @entity344 and @entity345 for dispatches from @entity27 .			1

@entity5 challenges the standards of beauty at @entity27
@entity5 was born with albinism : " i was always the outcast , but a confident outcast "
media outlets say quirky is in when it comes to models
some argue there 's still not enough diversity on the runway
