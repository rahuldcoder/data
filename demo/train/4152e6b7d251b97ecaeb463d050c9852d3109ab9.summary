-- for about a week , the nation 's catholic bishops enjoyed some measure of their bygone political clout			1
the bishops launched a vigorous grassroots campaign to protest a rule from the @entity10 administration 's health care mandate that would force many @entity12 institutions to cover birth control through their employee health plans			1
catholic churchgoers have seen such campaigns attempted before , with bishops issuing stinging denunciations that are repeated in church publications and in letters read to parishioners at every @entity22 but this time , to the surprise of many , the bishops ' effort seemed to work			1
president @entity10 quickly modified the rule			2
he did n't satisfy the bishops -- but still , the clergymen had upset the political calculus that they no longer affect @entity12 voters			2
the bishops were able to wield influence because their message against the contraception mandate was framed in a way that appealed to a broad spectrum of @entity37			1
for moderates and liberals , there were calls to freedom and conscience , rather than blunt declarations to heed ecclesial authority			0
for conservatives , there was the opportunity to circle the wagons against secularism			0
but if the bishops insist on coming across as shrill and partisan , as some are wont to do , they 'll wind up once again preaching to half the choir			1
moderate and liberal @entity37 wo n't stand behind the bishops if they perceive a partisan position			1
and it wo n't take much to trigger that reaction because certain bishops were transparently opposed to @entity10 during the 2008 election campaign , and many more of them later maligned the @entity64 for granting the president an honorary degree			1
i noticed a letter to the editor in the diocesan newspaper in @entity71 , where i live , that captures the unease i believe a good number of @entity37 feel			0
the writer said she understood the church 's position on the birth - control mandate , but she practically pleaded with the editor , who had accused the @entity10 administration of pushing socialism , to take a less polarizing tone			2
if the bishops really want to gain back some of the clout they used to hold , they would do well to consider the community organizing tactics that their own parishes have adopted in many poor urban neighborhoods			1
it is an approach that relies heavily on building consensus			0
guided by the writings of @entity94 , coalitions of houses of worship have organized around specific issues , such as a plan to build low - cost housing			0
the community organizers ' first step was to secure the enthusiastic support of parishioners , demonstrated through massive rallies			2
once pastors really do speak for their people , they are then in a position to demand that elected officials of whatever party support their agenda			0
@entity10 once was a community organizer for just such a church - funded coalition , working from a @entity12 rectory on @entity114 's @entity113			0
like the @entity114 politicians he encountered as a young man , @entity10 knows that a church 's grassroots campaign is only as effective as it is unified			0
i 'm not sure how many bishops know that			0
follow @entity122 on @entity123 join the conversation on @entity125 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity128 .			2

catholic bishops forced president to *compromise* on health care mandate
@entity128 : the bishops ' campaign worked because their message had a broad appeal
he says that if bishops become shrill and partisan , they will lose influence
moses : if bishops want to gain back clout , they should learn from community organizing
