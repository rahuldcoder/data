-- thirty years ago , the @entity1 enacted a law that has inadvertently condemned hundreds of thousands of @entity1 to death			1
as a result of the @entity5 , more @entity1 have lost their lives waiting for an organ than died in both @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 put together			1
the law bans almost any payment to living organ donors			1
recipients themselves can reimburse donors ' travel , lodging , and lost wages , which helps , when they have the money -- but not when they do n't			2
most people who are living donors give to a family member or friend , but the financial hardships are considerable and people are regularly denied permission to donate because they do n't have enough financial resources			1
i was denied for that reason when i wanted to donate an organ to save a friend 's life			0
with four kids in college , there was not enough ready cash to donate			0
and it was against the law for my friend or anyone else to help me with the $ 10,000 or more expenses i had above and beyond travel , lodging , and lost wages			0
i had passed all medical and psychological tests , yet the living donor coordinator at the transplant center denied our match			0
researching the issue i realized i was n't alone -- most @entity1 ca n't afford to donate without considerable financial hardship to themselves and their families			1
expenses that ca n't be reimbursed include things like travel costs for a spouse to come along and take care of the donor , that spouse 's lost wages , child - care , household responsibilities and lost income not measurable in wages , such as business income or farm income			1
giving an organ costs on average $ 5,000 , but can be as much as $ 20,000			1
according to @entity72 data , in 2013 , 20 % of @entity1 households had no discretionary funds at all , and only 8 % could afford to donate an organ at a cost of more than $ 5,000 without dipping into their savings or going into debt			1
in 1983 , 10,000 @entity1 were waiting for a transplant			2
today , the number is more than 120,000 , of whom 100,000 need kidneys			0
at least 400,000 @entity1 are on some kind of dialysis , many of whom might once have benefited from a transplant , but are now too sick to qualify , or never tried because the odds of securing an organ are so poor			2
we desperately need to find a way to compensate living donors for their costs			2
by enabling the government and private charities to cover all of a donor 's expenses as they come up , we would eliminate the lure of fast money , and ensure that people can actually afford to save others ' lives when they are willing			2
in 2011 , the government implemented a debit card system enabling people to cover the costs of recovering from natural disasters without having to incur debt			0
we could apply the same system to help organ donors cover their costs			1
in 2013 , there were 5,990 living @entity1 organ donors			1
if we doubled that rate , we could save over 50,000 lives in the first five years alone			0
and to top if off , by reducing the need for dialysis -- which is both expensive and a living death for most kidney disease patients -- it would save @entity119 money			0
very few people who come forward agreeing to donate realize that there is a financial sacrifice until they get well into the process			0
a 2006 article in the @entity126 reported a study in one hospital where almost one in four patients ' relatives changed their minds about donating an organ because it was too expensive			0
( @entity133 has similar restrictions on compensating donors as the @entity1			2
) the @entity5 applies to all major organs , tissues , and bone marrow , but the ban on compensating most expenses hurts those @entity1 who need kidneys , livers , and bone marrow most			2
these are all patients who can be helped by living donors , and together they constitute more than 90 % of @entity1 waiting for transplants			1
but according to the @entity147 , only 15 % of @entity1 waiting for a kidney , for example , will receive one			2
even if all @entity1 were to check the organ donor box on their driver 's licenses , a 2003 study in the @entity151 found that only about 1 % of people die under conditions that allow them to donate their organs -- the rest are too sick , too injured , or too far from a hospital when they die for their organs to be of use			1
thirty years ago , the @entity5 resulted from quite understandable revulsion at a proposal by dr. h. @entity164 that the government pay people to come to the @entity1 to donate their kidneys			1
the government , @entity164 figured , could spend relatively little compensating such donors -- maybe only $ 1,000 per kidney -- and then send them on their way			0
the prospect of the @entity1 shipping thousands of impoverished people here from developing nations so that rich @entity1 could harvest their kidneys reads like the plot of a science fiction novel			2
both democrats and @entity177 rightly fear that reforming the law too dramatically could encourage poor and at - risk populations to sell their organs in exchange for quick cash			0
unfortunately , @entity182 has allowed the pendulum to swing too far in the other direction			0
by banning almost all compensation to living donors , the government has ensured that only the wealthiest and their friends can afford the costs of donating , while hundreds of thousands of other @entity1 suffer and die			1
the original intention of the @entity5 was to help those in the greatest medical need first			0
@entity182 could still enact reforms consistent with that intention			0
it could allow @entity147 , with the help of federal funds , to pay donation - related expenses for @entity1 willing to help those who are at the top of the waiting list			1
and it could enable recipients and charities to support donors who helped any patient who needed a transplant			0
these measures together would assure that government funds went to those closest to dying , and allow non-government funds to cover donor expenses for anyone anywhere on the list			0
thirty years ago , the representatives who passed the @entity5 were unquestionably right to forbid rich @entity1 from exploiting people from developing countries by trafficking in organs			1
but they were wrong to forbid helping @entity1 organ donors with legitimate expenses			1
now , as then , living organ donors make heroic sacrifices to give life to others			1
we need to do anything we can to help them do that			0
by striking a new compromise we can save thousands of @entity1 lives .			0

more died waiting for an organ than in @entity230 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12
@entity232 : @entity233 bans most payment to living organ donors
giving an organ costs $ 5,000 average , up to $ 20,000 : most @entity1 ca n't afford it
@entity241 : we need to pay costs of someone donating organs to people most in need
