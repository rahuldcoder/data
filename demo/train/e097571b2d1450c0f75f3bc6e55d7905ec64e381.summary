-- at age of 52 , it might be too late to re-visit your beliefs and principles in order to change them			0
when you see the regression from where we were , to the situation now and realize the dream you have been working towards has moved almost entirely out - of - reach , you feel tired , hopeless , and less motivated to recharge yourself			0
i was born in @entity15 in 1962 to a refugee family who had been expelled from their village " @entity19 " in the then @entity21 -- mandate of @entity22			1
five years later , in june 1967 , @entity15 was occupied by @entity23 , which meant that i grew up under the occupation			1
when you live under occupation , your national ambitions become clearer and stronger			0
i promised myself that i would do my utmost to contribute to achieving peace and freedom for our people and region through talks and debates			2
in 1987 , at the age of 27 , i took part in the first intifada , which i viewed as largely peaceful , with boys and girls throwing stones at well - equipped @entity23 soldiers			1
through that struggle , we succeeding in winning the hearts and minds , not only of the international community but also many @entity23 themselves ; who became advocates for our right to have a free and independent @entity52 state			1
i learned , to some extent , what freedom meant when i took my first plane trip , flying to @entity56 via @entity57 in 1993			0
i had been invited by @entity58 in my capacity as the founder of the organization 's @entity52 branch			1
i wrote articles and appeared on television and radio to promote human rights and non-violent struggle ; i was invited to address @entity23 audiences and receive @entity23 citizens in @entity15 itself			1
i also stood as a candidate in the first @entity52 parliamentary elections in 1996			1
then , my dream of being a free citizen in a free state grew and flourished , but over time it gradually became weaker and weaker			2
twenty years ago , how to make peace with @entity23 was a daily topic for the @entity52 people			1
it was very normal to see tens of @entity23 citizens walking freely along @entity15 streets , shopping and making conversation			1
on the other side of the border , an influential @entity23 camp was advocating making peace with the @entity52			1
nowadays , " peace " is perhaps the least used word in @entity15 's daily lexicon , replaced as it has been by the terms ; tanks , @entity93 , killing , shelling , rockets and revenge			1
and in @entity23 , politicians and groups compete to see who will be more aggressive towards the @entity52			1
this is demonstrated by the success of the extreme right in politics			0
twenty years ago , more than 80,000 @entity52 workers went to @entity23 every day to work alongside @entity23 , acting as ambassadors for co-existance			1
twenty years ago , it was common to see the slogan and fliers " @entity110 " on cars and at shops and restaurants			1
making peace with the @entity52 appeared to be a priority for the @entity23 public			1
recently , the @entity23 government built a huge wall separating @entity23 from the @entity52 territories			1
now that @entity23 citizens can not see us any more , it seems they have lost sight of our reality			0
and the reality has been deteriorating			0
when the @entity23 began building separation walls in the late 1990s , many of its citizens were being killed by suicide bombers			0
in september 2000 , the second intifada erupted with a far more violent face than its predecessor			0
@entity134 won the election in 2006 and took control from @entity137 forcibly in june 2007 , prompting @entity23 to blockade the @entity15 , which created humanitarians crises			2
since then @entity23 has declared three wars against @entity15 , in 2008 , 2012 and now 2014			2
meantime , @entity134 and other resistance movements continue to launch homemade rockets into @entity23 's cities			0
within the new reality , the @entity23 and @entity52 are unable to see / meet / talk / interact with each other			2
i always say , it is easy to fight someone you do n't know and / or have no mutual interests with , but you can not make peace with someone unless you know them well and share interests			0
this is why it has been easy for the new generations on both sides -- @entity23 and @entity52 -- to fight each other aggressively			1
they have never met and they do n't see the benefit of living peacefully			0
nowadays , they communicate from a distance through rockets , bullets , shelling , guns -- instead of physically interacting			0
the generations of both sides have been taken hostages by the conflict , they consume and waste their energy and resources to make the other 's life more difficult			0
both generations have to work harder to find the lost opportunity , which is hidden underneath scene of the conflict ; they have to be educated to look differently			0
regional cooperation in today 's globalized world , the problems have become cross-border despite being perceived as local			0
both @entity23 and @entity52 suffer severe water shortages , pollution , population growth , radicalism , unemployment			2
but while the cost of conflict to both is huge , the profit of peace would be much higher			0
in addition to the waste of their own resources , the @entity52 have received billions of dollars of aid in the past 20 years since the @entity198 accord , while @entity23 receives @entity200 aid assistance of about us $ 3 billion every year			1
some of the international aid and the local resources are spent in fueling the conflict , though it would make a huge and positive difference to people 's lives if such huge amounts were instead used in developmental projects			0
both the @entity23 and @entity52 governments might be able to reach a peace agreement , but achieving culture of peace remains distant			1
i have never thought to leave @entity15 or to emigrate , though i have always easy access to such a possibility			2
i believe that @entity15 is in need of an " agent of change			2
" i have been and i wanted to continue to be such an agent of change			0
but i feel tired , hopeless and less motivated to recharge myself			0
what is @entity23 's endgame in @entity15 ? what is @entity134 ' endgame in @entity15 ? how do we get a cease - fire to end the bloodshed in @entity15 ?			2

@entity230 was born to a @entity52 refugee family and grew up in @entity15
in 1987 he *participated* in the first intifada and went on to work for as a peace campaigner
but he says as violence has *increased* , so has the *gap* between citizens on both sides
he says it is *disheartening* to see that @entity15 is further from peace than it was 20 years ago
