-- @entity1 hopes to jazz up its news feed with the addition of 150 super influencers on the network who fans can follow , a la @entity8			1
the elite circle includes president @entity10 , @entity12 presidential candidate @entity11 , physician / writer @entity13 , @entity16 founder / ceo @entity15 , motivational speaker @entity17 and @entity19 's founder / ceo @entity18 , among others			1
fans can follow the celebs for regular updates , just like on @entity8			1
however , there are some differences			0
there 's no 140 - character limit on updates and the communication is designed to be business - related			2
" our goal is to always make sure that there 's high quality , " says @entity29 , executive editor at @entity1			2
when asked when the next round of super-influencers will be added , @entity29 replied , " the answer is we do n't know			0
" @entity1 has reason to wade cautiously into this @entity39 feature			1
while fake accounts and off - subject tweets are part of that social network 's charm , unleashing the same on @entity1 could destroy its niche as a sober forum for business			1
as such , the activity of the initial 150 will be different than their @entity8 feeds			1
" people come here for a purpose , " @entity29 says			0
" they 're at work or thinking about work			0
it 's not about their personal lives			0
" the group 's ability to engage @entity1 's audience will be ranked by views , likes , comments and shares that are visible to all users			2
such metrics will both act as a self - regulating feature , but will also prompt the inevitable ranking of the top 10 and bottom 10			0
the addition of the program is the latest evolution for the nine - year - old @entity1 , which was initially little more than an online rolodex			2
over time , the site has emerged as a social network with its own hive of activity			0
@entity8 's decision in june to no longer let users tweet to @entity1 may have actually helped the company overcome criticism that it 's a low - engagement network : @entity81 , an analytics tool for @entity83 , found that the @entity8 disentanglement actually prompted a 1,000 % increase in page referrals from @entity83			1
since the @entity8 breakup , @entity1 also ushered in a redesign that made it look more like @entity83 or @entity90			1
what do you think ? will this spur more activity on @entity1 ? sound off in the comments below			0
