-- @entity1 have suffered their worst opening day defeat since 1937 , losing 3 - 0 to @entity3 on saturday			1
@entity8 , in their first game since @entity7 's departure , could only manage a goalless draw at home to @entity11			1
elsewhere , the @entity14 began in explosive style , as @entity16 recorded a 5 - 0 win over @entity18 , @entity13 also beat @entity19 by a five goal margin , @entity12 celebrated their return to @entity23 's top division with a 1 - 0 victory over @entity25 , while @entity26 and @entity27 shared the points in a 1 - 1 draw			1
@entity1 and @entity30 were both playing their first games under new management , with @entity33 having moved to @entity34 from @entity16 and @entity35 taking his first managerial post at @entity3 after being sacked from his assistant manager 's role with @entity1 at the end of last season			1
" i thought the scoreline was harsh , i 've got to be honest , " @entity33 told the @entity1 website			1
" after the first couple of minutes of the game , we got good control and rhythm in our game			2
up until they scored the first goal , it looked as though we were the team who were going to get it			2
@entity1 finished the game with ten men , after defender @entity56 was sent off for a foul on @entity30 striker @entity58 , giving away a penalty in the process			1
" obviously then with 10 men and chasing the game , it becomes difficult , " the former @entity16 manager explained			1
" we conceded a penalty and then the sending off kills you , really			2
especially for a new team that is coming together in terms of the structure and ideas			2
" @entity1 have not had such a disastrous start since @entity72 beat them 6 - 1 on the opening day of the 1937 season			1
@entity75 rang around the @entity76 as the final whistle blew on the first game of @entity8 's @entity80 era			1
manager @entity81 gave debuts to new signings @entity84 and @entity85 , and introduced @entity86 in the second half for the @entity89 's first competitive showing in an @entity8 shirt			1
despite controlling the majority of the play , @entity8 could n't find the net to get their season off to a winning start			1
" we played with a good spirit			0
we were serious , we put the effort in			0
our basic fitness is alright but we lack sharpness and fluency at the moment to be dangerous in the final third			0
" @entity81 told the @entity8 website			1
" the few chances we had , we could n't convert them			0
@entity11 always play the same way against us , in the final third and defensively , and if you 're not sharp enough to make the difference early in the game it becomes difficult			1
" @entity11 put in a dogged display to take their first point of the season , and had a couple of opportunities to win the match from set pieces , despite their defensive set up			1
" it was a terrific performance by the team , considering that after about 60 odd minutes we were out on our feet , " manager @entity119 told the club 's website			0
" it was a very warm day , we were away from home and we had to soak up pressure			0
i thought we were really excellent ; it was a brilliant effort			0
" we 've got a point , we 're off the mark and we 've got a home game to look forward to			0
" in @entity133 , @entity18 were hoping to fulfill some of their pre-season promise			1
after a number of high profile signings , such as @entity138 from @entity139 and @entity140 from @entity72 , hopes were high that the club could avoid the relegation struggle they faced last year			0
@entity16 , widely tipped as relegation candidates this season , put in an incredible performance to sour the mood at @entity18 ' home ground , @entity148			1
" it 's always nice to win your first game of the season and to win away from home is always important because it can give you so much confidence going forward , " explained @entity16 manager @entity149 to the club website			1
" it gives us something to build on			0
but the players are the most important , and i 'm delighted for them			0
" two goals for new signing @entity164 got the @entity168 side 's season under way , and @entity18 never looked capable of a recovery			1
" it was a wake up call			0
maybe everybody was getting a little but excited about what 's ahead of us but we , as a group , understand there 's a lot of hard work needed , " @entity18 manager @entity173 told the club 's website			1
" today was n't the level i expect us to perform at			0
you can make all the excuses in the world that it was a hot day and the first game of the season , but that does n't wash with me			2
we need to perform better			0
" in the end we were ragged , made bad decisions , the accuracy of our passing was poor all day and as a consequence we got picked off very easily			0
" all credit to @entity16 , they played exceptionally well and they took their chances when they came			1
" the two promoted sides in action today , @entity26 and @entity12 , both enjoyed a promising start to the season			1
@entity12 ran out 1 - 0 winners over @entity25 with a controversial goal from captain @entity206			1
@entity25 believed play had stopped due to an offside flag , allowing @entity206 to easily score			2
" some of the play , i was really happy with and some , like anything , you 're not			0
but i ca n't fault the lads for effort			0
their effort was excellent , " explained @entity25 manager @entity215 to the club website			0
" we tried , but there was n't much in the game			0
i thought we looked bright but we 've got to turn our possession into chances			0
if we can just get a finishing touch on that then we 'll be okay			0
" @entity26 looked like they were going to mark their return to the @entity14 with a 1 - 0 home defeat to @entity27			1
however , a last minute penalty from @entity229 rescued a point for last season 's @entity232 winners			2
" i think it would have been unjust if we 'd lost but injustices are no good to anyone , you have to get results and we 've done that			0
we wanted to win it after we got to 1 - 1 , " reading manager @entity241 told @entity26 's website after the game			1
@entity27 had been fortunate to take the lead when a speculative shot from new signing @entity246 slipped through @entity26 goalkeeper @entity248 's hands and into the net			1
" i am so pleased he scored today			0
we had wide players who did n't really score last season but @entity257 has come in and put pressure on them from the word go which is what we want , " @entity27 manager @entity252 told his club 's website			1
" we need forward to score goals and for us our wide players are forwards			2
the extra competition can only help us this season			2
" @entity13 joined @entity16 at the top of the table with a dominating 5 - 0 win over @entity19			1
the @entity133 side 's preparations have been overshadowed by the transfer rumors swirling around star player @entity271 , but it was the club 's new signing that stole the headlines on the opening day of the season			2
@entity277 scored two goals on his full debut , with @entity280 , @entity281 and @entity282 picking up a goal each			0
" i am very happy			0
not only because of my performance , but because we had an amazing start today which will be very important for us throughout the rest of the season , " @entity277 told the @entity13 website			1
" all of us played a very good game ; we defended very well -- i think they had just one or two chances to score -- and we scored five goals which means that we played very well today			2
" @entity19 were playing their first game under new manager @entity294 , but struggled to replicate some of their impressive form from last season			2
" you have to remember that it 's the first game of the season , we 've all been there before , " said @entity294			2
" whether it 's at the start of the season the middle or at the end defeats are defeats and you have to be able to bounce back from them and learn from them			2
" in the late kick off , @entity308 needed a late penalty to overcome a spirited display from @entity314 ' @entity313 side			0
the @entity316 manager was taking charge of the @entity133 team for the first time in a competitive match , and looked to have secured a valuable point when @entity322 equalized @entity324 's early second half strike			0
@entity308 manager @entity325 could face @entity327 charges after he was sent to the stands for shoving the assistant referee .			0

@entity1 lose 3 - 0 to @entity3 , @entity8 only draw with @entity11
@entity16 and @entity13 both score five to top table
@entity18 endure miserable start to the season
new @entity14 sides @entity26 and @entity12 enjoy promising starts
