@entity1 's stepfather says he 's sorry for his emotional outburst to demonstrators after learning officer @entity4 would n't be indicted in the teen 's death			1
but he says he 's unfairly taking heat for the rioting that followed			1
despite @entity11 police chief @entity11 's assertion that police are investigating whether @entity13 intended to incite a riot with his words , law enforcement sources told @entity16 that @entity13 is unlikely to be prosecuted			1
@entity13 said wednesday that " emotions got the best of me " on the night of november 24 in @entity11 , @entity19 , when he yelled " burn this motherf --- er down ! " and " burn this bitch down ! " " i was so angry and full of raw emotions , as so many others were , and granted , i screamed out words that i should n't have screamed in the heat of the moment , " he said in a statement obtained exclusively by @entity16 's @entity23			1
" it was wrong , and i humbly apologize to all of those who read my pain and anger as a true desire for what i want for our community			2
" but to place blame solely on me for the conditions of our community , and country , after the grand jury decision , goes way too far and is as wrong as the decision itself			0
to declare a state of emergency and send a message of war , and not peace , before a grand jury decision was announced is also wrong			0
" in the end , i 've lived in this community for a long time			0
the last thing i truly wanted was to see it go up in flames			0
in spite of my frustration , it really hurt to see that			0
" no charges likely do n't expect any charges to come from the @entity11 and @entity61 investigation into @entity13 's comments , local law enforcement officials tell @entity16			1
the officials say the investigation is n't likely to go anywhere , in part because it would face a high bar to prove that @entity13 's words actually caused any rioters to act			1
one law enforcement official was frustrated by @entity11 's comments , which officials view as inflammatory at a time when they 're trying to calm the situation			1
" we just wish he would just shut up , " the law enforcement official said			1
even if the investigation into @entity13 's comments does n't result in charges , the police investigation could still cause problems for him			1
federal court records indicate he is on probation for a previous drug charge			0
@entity16 reached out to his probation officer , but there was no response to a request for comment			0
complete coverage of what 's happening in @entity11 ' he just spoke out of anger ' @entity1 's mother , @entity95 , was standing next to @entity13 , her husband , when he made the comments			1
she herself told the crowd that night that she 'd never experienced anything like this , and offered some context in a @entity16 interview last week			1
after hearing the grand jury 's decision , @entity95 said she felt like she 'd been shot herself and her " emotions were raging			2
" @entity13 was angry , too , she said			1
" he just spoke out of anger			0
it 's one thing to speak , and it 's a different thing to act			2
he just spoke out of anger , " she said			0
" when you 're that hurt and the system has did you this wrong , you may say some things as well			0
we 've all spoke out of anger before			0
" asked if her husband could be responsible for the fires and rioting , she replied , " that 's impossible			2
... these things have been going on since august 9 , when it first happened			0
" @entity123 : we never talk about race until something bad happens ' @entity127 ... hard to prove ' @entity16 law enforcement analyst @entity128 told @entity16 on tuesday that he thought a prosecution was unlikely			1
" i think they 'll have a hard time proving that somebody that heard him in the midst of all that noise actually went over and did an arson or committed an act of starting a fire			0
i think most of the people you see in the crowd are not watching @entity16			0
they 're not watching media reporting of him saying that , " he said			0
also , @entity128 said , it 's likely many people who had gathered in @entity11 as the grand jury 's decision was announced were already determined to act			1
" i think the cause and effect of his words will be hard to prove , " @entity128 said			2
protests nationwide @entity1 's august shooting death -- and last week 's grand jury decision not to indict the officer who killed him -- have sparked numerous protests in @entity11 and across the country			1
demonstrations heated up again on wednesday after a grand jury in @entity163 decided not to indict a police officer in the choking death of @entity166 , an unarmed black man suspected of selling cigarettes illegally			2
four members of the @entity171 's bicycle unit were injured after they were struck by a car while doing crowd control as a large group of high school students protested the @entity11 grand jury 's decision , @entity16 affiliate @entity168 reported			1
one of the officers is in critical condition undergoing surgery , police said			2
this week attorney general @entity181 visited @entity182 in what he said would be a series of nationwide conversations after the upheaval in @entity11			1
" this presents this nation with , i think , a unique opportunity , " @entity181 said			0
" and i think it 's incumbent on all of us to seize this opportunity to deal with issues that for too long have been ignored			2
" @entity181 will be traveling to @entity194 on thursday , the @entity193 said , followed by trips to @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 , @entity200			0
