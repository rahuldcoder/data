-- most @entity1 probably still believe the biggest threat to our national security is terrorism			1
we 're debating increasingly intrusive security measures , and not long ago we heard about a homegrown terrorist in @entity8 who wanted to cause a huge explosion at a @entity11 tree - lighting ceremony			0
yet @entity13 drug cartels are arguably as dangerous and deadly as terrorists , and they were operating far inside our borders well before 9/11			1
the decision to go into @entity17 was an easy one to make ; or at least it was in 2001			2
shortly after the 9/11 attacks , @entity1 learned all about @entity20			1
we were prepared to do whatever it took , spend whatever it cost , and deploy tens of thousands of our soldiers , sailors , @entity27 and airmen to effectively and efficiently do the job			0
it seems like the job they 've been doing is working , to an extent			0
we have n't experienced a large terrorist attack on @entity1 soil since 9/11 and @entity20 is a shadow of its former self			2
but do we know for a fact that our presence in @entity17 is the exact thing that 's preventing more terrorist attacks ? maybe , and maybe not			2
most people do n't want to take chances , and most people would say that terrorism is still the biggest threat to our national security			0
let 's switch gears for a minute to the drug war in @entity13 , where more than 30,000 people have been killed since president @entity53 came into office and the annual body count goes up every december			1
granted , most of the people being tortured , kidnapped or killed have historically been criminals involved in the drug trade			0
however , that 's changing			0
we 're seeing more and more innocent bystanders , including children , being gunned down as collateral damage			0
the big concern , of course , is whether the violence is going to spill over into the @entity1			2
but there are two real problems with this debate			0
first , no standardized definition exists as to what constitutes border violence spillover			0
it really is in the eye of the beholder , which means that if you ask a @entity80 city mayor and an @entity81 rural border county sheriff whether they 're seeing it , you 're likely going to get two very different answers			0
the second problem is that we 're too focused on spillover in the border area to realize that @entity13 drug cartels have deeply infiltrated every corner of the @entity1 , and they did so well before terrorism and religious extremists entered our national consciousness			1
according to the @entity1 @entity97 's @entity96 , members of @entity13 cartels are operating in more than 270 @entity1 cities and thousands of smaller communities			1
those same cartels dominate drug trafficking operations in places like @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 , @entity111			2
violent gangs across the country act as their proxies and sell @entity13 drugs like marijuana , crystal methamphetamine , brown powder and black tar heroin , and @entity121 cocaine in our cities and neighborhoods from @entity124 to @entity125 , @entity126			2
so why do n't we hear more in the media about the activities of @entity13 cartels on @entity1 soil ? mostly because cartels like to keep a low profile and blend in			1
drawing attention to cartel operations in the @entity1 is very bad for business and our law enforcement officers can generally be depended on to do their jobs			2
a big shootout in a @entity124 shopping district or downtown @entity105 between dozens of heavily armed cartel gunmen and the @entity141 is n't going to happen any time soon			0
but that does n't mean drug - related violence is n't happening in the @entity1 , and sometimes well away from the border			1
in 2009 , five mutilated bodies were found outside a drug stash house in a well - to - do northern @entity148 county			0
dozens of law enforcement officers have been shot at and many severely injured by heavily armed men who work for @entity13 cartels defending marijuana crops in states like @entity8 , @entity156 and @entity157			2
closer to the border , last year , gang members from " @entity159 " were indicted in the kidnapping , torture and murder of nine people in @entity165			0
two of those victims were dissolved in vats of acid after they were killed			0
this is the real and current major threat to our national security -- tens of thousands of violent @entity13 cartel members who are living and operating under our noses in our cities , communities and public lands			1
we 've spent more than $ 365 billion on the war in @entity17 since 2001 , and about 1,400 military members have lost their lives in the process			1
we 've committed only $ 1.6 billion to the drug war in @entity13 -- only a few hundred million of which has actually been spent since 2007 -- and our military is n't allowed to step one foot in - country unless it 's for training purposes			1
in a time when our national deficit is skyrocketing and the collective belt is tightening , we need to take a good look at our priorities when it comes to national security			0
so can our commitments to @entity17 and @entity13 be compared ? maybe , maybe not			1
we know the number of innocent @entity1 who died as a result of terrorist attacks on @entity1 soil			1
but we also have a rough idea of how many @entity1 die every year as a result of using drugs being peddled by @entity13 cartels operating in our country			1
i can assure you that the number of @entity1 drug casualties is much higher			1
we also need to take into account the cost of interdicting even a small percentage of those drugs at the border , as well as the environmental toll that domestic marijuana cultivation is taking on our nation 's landscape			0
@entity17 and @entity13 ca n't be compared in the ways we 're fighting those wars , but they certainly can in the ways our government chooses to assess and protect us from the threats they pose			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			0

@entity228 : huge number of @entity13 drug cartel members in @entity1 since well before 9/11
we fight in @entity17 , she writes , but should fight deadly and dangerous cartels at home
@entity228 : more @entity1 die from *overdose* and drug violence than in terror attacks
$ 365 billion for @entity17 war ; she says , $ 1.6 billion for drug war in @entity13 with little spent so far
