-- he might be fighting it out with @entity3 for the title of the world 's top soccer player , but @entity7 is in a league of his very own when it comes to social media followers			1
tuesday saw the @entity12 superstar top 100 million " fans " on @entity15 -- way ahead of the nearest sporting opposition			1
he is adding fans at the rate of nearly one every second , 54 per minute on average			0
the next best tally is not an individual but a club , @entity22 , which has over 76 million ' likes ' -- just edging ahead of @entity7 's own team , @entity25 champion @entity23			0
the 29 - year - old @entity7 is also on top of the sporting world on @entity29 with over 30 million followers			1
that is 10 million more than second placed @entity32 , a star @entity33 footballer and former @entity23 teammate of @entity7			0
@entity37 standout @entity36 has the third most popular sports profile on @entity29 at 15.3 million followers and also trails on the @entity15 front with his account ' liked ' by a shade under 22 million people			1
when @entity7 tweeted he had won @entity46 's @entity45 for the second time on january 13 , it received over 118,000 retweets and according to sports market researchers @entity49 its total reach in teams of retweets , mentions and replies topped 1.04 million			1
this compares to @entity36 ' most popular day on @entity29 -- the announcement of his move to @entity57 , where the total figure was 672,000			0
both sets of figures are undoubtedly impressive and @entity36 is thought to have a huge following in @entity62 , where @entity15 and @entity29 are banned			1
" he 's a good looking guy and very savvy in terms of partnerships and the brands he endorses , " @entity49 's head of digital @entity64 told @entity0 , explaining why @entity7 was way out in front			0
" he 's going down the @entity70 route and is extremely well managed			0
" @entity7 's physical appearance is clearly a factor in his widespread following outside of avid sports fans , but @entity64 said his most popular tweets were all football related			1
" the social media traffic around the @entity45 announcement but also @entity23 winning the @entity79 for a record 10th time ( @entity81 ) was vast , " he said			2
@entity49 's founder and ceo @entity82 told @entity0 that companies backing @entity7 were on to a winner on and off the field			0
" for example , in two days , @entity89 's @entity88 campaign which was endorsed through six posts by @entity7 led to an estimated 34.92 million @entity15 views and 2.4 million " likes " for these @entity89 related posts , " he said			1
" all of which generated an estimated value of $ 380,000 to the @entity89 brand			0
" @entity49 takes into account a range of factors , from the simple number of people who have seen a social media posting through to the quality and duration of the brand exposure to reach its conclusions			2
" when @entity7 won his first @entity79 title with @entity111 in 2008 , the @entity109 powerhouses did not have have an official @entity29 account , " said @entity64			2
@entity111 's official @entity29 feed now has over 3.55 million followers			2
its former star player shows no sign of resting on his social media laurels , launching his own official community digital platform , @entity119 , with a downloadable app and other special features			2
fans are promised prizes , autographed memorabilia and even the chance to meet him			0
any sports star hoping to mount a challenge to @entity7 's @entity15 and @entity29 supremacy clearly faces as tough a test as the hapless defenders trying to keep the prolific striker off the score sheet			1
@entity7 is averaging well over a goal per game already this season for @entity23			0
but as @entity64 points out , even more modest outfits such as unheralded @entity138 side @entity137 can benefit from social media 's exponential growth			2
" @entity137 grew its @entity15 ' fan ' base by over 800 % last year , with much of the increase coming from @entity144 ( @entity137 's owner @entity145 is @entity144 ) , " he said			0
for @entity7 , his attraction is not limited to a single country or region , with research suggesting he 's known by over 84 % of the world 's population -- giving plenty of scope still for him to increase his @entity15 and @entity29 fan base yet more .			1
