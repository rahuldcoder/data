films such as " @entity1 " carry with them an uncommonly high concentration of influence and opportunity			2
due to the scarcity of diverse and inspiring representations on screen , @entity6 's latest movie casts a longer shadow than many are willing to acknowledge			1
in a recent interview with @entity14 @entity13 , @entity6 stated his goals and interpretation of the @entity19 - nominated film 's impact : " i 've always wanted to explore slavery ... to give black @entity22 males a hero ... and revenge			1
... i am responsible for people talking about slavery in @entity22 in a way they have not in 30 years			2
" he went on , " violence on slaves has n't been dealt with to the extent that i 've dealt with it			2
" my personal biracial experience growing up on both sides of segregated hoods , suburbs and backcountry taught me a lot about the coded language and arithmetic of racism			0
i was often invisible when topics of race arose , the racial adoptee that you spoke honestly in front of			0
i grew up hearing the candid dirt from both sides , and i studied it			0
the conversation was almost always influenced by something people read or saw on a screen			0
media portrayals greatly affect , if not entirely construct , how we interpret " otherness			0
" people see what they are shown , and little else			0
it 's why my dad forced me to study and value history from an absurdly young age -- to build a foundation solid enough to withstand cultural omissions from the curriculum and distortions from the media			2
it 's what led me to become a teacher of @entity22 and @entity72 history out of college			2
there is a glaring difference in outlook between those who have mined the rich , empowering truth about how we 've come to be , and those who just accept that there 's only one or two people of @entity72 descent deemed worthy of entire history books			2
if , like @entity6 , you show up with a megaphone and claim to be creating a real solution to a specific problem , i only ask that you not instead , construct something unnecessarily fake and then act like you 've done us a favor			1
vote for your @entity19 favorites " @entity1 " is being projected on screens around the world , out of context : a slim percentage of consumers have any real understanding of what took place during slavery , one of history 's most prolonged , barbaric and celebrated human rights violations			1
sadly , for many @entity22 , this film is the beginning and the end of that history lesson			2
this film follows a brave , cunning and fearless lead character whose name starts with a " @entity115 " viewers of the film 's trailer would think that character is @entity117 , played by @entity118			1
in fact , his name is dr. @entity1 , a @entity121 portrayed by @entity122 , ( spoiler alert ) who sacrifices his life in the pursuit of freedom and justice for the black man			2
it is the white dr. @entity1 , who after sharing a motivational tale about a man reaching a mountaintop , nobly gives his life for " black justice			2
" @entity6 rightly claims that the abundant use of " nigger " in the film was authentic and of the time			1
so was chattel slavery and the back - breaking manual labor that kept these massive plantations thriving			2
@entity6 's plantations are nearly empty farms with well - dressed @entity146 in flowing gowns , frolicking on swings and enjoying leisurely strolls through the grounds , as if the setting is @entity152 , mixed in with occasional acts of barbarism against slaves			1
it 's the opposite of the exploration of the real phenomenon of slavery about which he boasts			1
sometimes we sacrifice accuracy for story , but these inaccuracies are completely unnecessary			0
how does depicting slave plantations like circus campgrounds , fit with delirious , babbling overseers wielding bull whips and overdressed rabble wandering aimlessly , further @entity117 's truth ? the film 's antagonist , @entity173 , played by @entity174 , supposedly runs one of the very worst plantations in all of @entity177			1
yet on the road he dines with his slaves , and at home , his fields are mostly empty and he only seems to have slaves in his house			0
is this one of those rare slave plantations that primarily trades in polished silverware and gossip ? that authenticity card that @entity6 uses to buy all those " niggers " has an awfully selective memory			1
in the film 's opening sequence , shackled blacks literally hold the key to their shackles and do n't use them , choosing instead to trudge forward , hindered by biting chains , to kill a white man			1
in the third act , after seeing @entity117 kill the @entity198 , the blacks sitting in an open cage neither communicate with each other or consider stepping outside of the cage			1
review : ' @entity1 ' in fact , in this entire , nearly three - hour film , there are no scenes with black people interacting , or even looking at each other , in a respectful or productive way			1
if only one black person ( @entity117 ) displays the vaguest interest in gaining freedom , while the rest consistently demonstrate that they would n't do anything with that freedom , were they to obtain it , then we 're not able to become invested in them or their pursuits : we ca n't relate to shiftless characters			1
being illiterate , and / or brown , does not remove the ability to think , or observe or yearn or plan or develop meaningful relationships			0
despite the repeated suggestions that they are similar narratives , " @entity1 " has little in common with " @entity228 , " @entity6 's 2009 fantasy involving a band of @entity22 soldiers taking revenge against the @entity233			1
the latter 's title characters choose to form a band of men who risk their lives for a generous and creative endeavor to stop the holocaust completely , saving all of their people , not just one			1
" @entity117 " is just a random guy , who , to no credit of his own , was plucked from slavery by an impressive white man and led on a journey to save his wife			1
" @entity228 " did not walk us through provocative scenes of concentration camp torture , gas chambers and ethnically stereotyped victims			0
nor were @entity254 characters subjected to the indignities of being torn apart by dogs			2
and while we have our trusty authenticity card out , did the @entity254 people not suffer the repeated verbal onslaught of " kike , " " rats " and other grotesque terms ? were such words used in " @entity228 " more than 100 times ? how about 70 ? ok 30 ? 10 ? thankfully , @entity6 knew that he was perfectly able to tell a story without such gimmicks			1
( he also knew the community he claimed to be avenging would n't stand for it			0
) hey , remember when @entity6 was selling those emaciated @entity254 prisoner action figures with the concentration camp tattoos ? so funny and ironic and harmless , right ? no. that would have been cheap and disgusting			1
yet the filmmakers agreed to the release of action - figure slave and slaver dolls to help promote " @entity117			1
" it was an especially offensive decision because selling slave figurines falls directly in line with the centuries - old @entity22 tradition of desensitizing us to the horrors of slavery with cute , palatable commodities			0
@entity6 did n't invent this tacky strategy ; he just dug it back up			1
opinion : why ' @entity117 ' stirs race debate think for a moment of the lengths that @entity6 went , to create a heroic triumph for his " @entity228			1
" he created an imaginary scenario wherein his characters could outwit and ultimately incinerate @entity291 and his top advisers in a movie theater			0
it was choose - your - own - adventure heroism to create figures that took complete agency in the acquisition of their freedom			0
a big reason slavery is avoided in @entity22 storytelling is guilt			0
unlike the holocaust , when it comes to slavery , our people were the bad guys			0
but we 're not @entity121 , so we can rail on @entity291 and the @entity233 all day without thinking critically about our legacy			0
for descendants of slaves , and all @entity22 , our ovens -- the slave plantations -- are tourist destinations and wedding venues , home to preservation societies and guided tours			0
the " good ole days , " when faceless black folks with zero potential were merely quiet , collateral damage			0
@entity22 's minimal comprehension of slavery combined with the kind of trivialization " @entity117 " offers renders us ill - equipped to empathize with its victims			1
this is a chicken or the egg manipulation : " do i know nothing about the complexity of slavery because it 's not that big a deal , or must it not be that big a deal because i 'm only vaguely informed ? " none of my criticisms would be different had the person in the director 's chair been a different color ( though all widely released @entity22 films heavily involving slavery in the @entity22 have been directed by white men )			1
my concerns are limited to the onscreen material , its advertised aims and the consequences			0
we try so hard to distance ourselves from the generations that made a business out of systematically crippling a people and the public 's vision of their abilities and intentions			0
we 're so different now , are n't we ? we are civilized			0
by popular measure , so were they			0
and we deserve better , than this lazy , oversimplified reduction of our history			0

director @entity6 says he " wanted to explore slavery " in his film
@entity373 says @entity6 's version of slavery is wildly *unreal*
he says few films have dealt with slavery , making it *important* to handle subject with respect
@entity373 : ' " @entity117 " *subordinates* black characters , fails to *illuminate* slavery
