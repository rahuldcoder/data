@entity0 -- some @entity5 and @entity6 products are being taken off the market because the child - resistant caps failed to function properly , @entity3 officials said on thursday			1
the @entity10 said triaminic syrups and @entity12 for cough , colds and fevers were voluntarily recalled by the manufacturer , @entity17 , because the cap could still be removed by a child even with the tamper - resistant seal in place			1
@entity17 said the last batch of products in question were distributed more than a year ago , so the company believes little remains for sale or in use			1
the agency said the products contain acetaminophen and diaphenhydramine , main ingredients in a number of cough , cold and allergy medicines			1
acetaminophen is an anti-inflammatory used to treat pain , while diaphenhydramine is an antihistamine used to treat allergies and colds			0
under federal law , products containing these drugs must be sealed with child - resistant packaging due to the risk of poisoning			2
the consumer watchdog said that consumers should stop using the recalled products immediately if they come across any of them and contact @entity17 for information about refunds			1
according to the consumer agency 's website , 24 different types of products are included in the recall			1
a consumer complaint in late november triggered the investigation			2
all of the products were made in the @entity3			1
@entity62 , a @entity17 spokeswoman , told @entity1 that there are 183 lots included in the recall - 142 of @entity11 and 41 of @entity12			0
however , since they were distributed between may 24 , 2010 , and december 21 , 2011 , approximately 97 % of the @entity6 and @entity67 inventory has already been consumed , returned to @entity17 , or quarantined at a @entity17 warehouse			0
it is likely that very little product remains on store shelves or in homes , @entity62 said			0
so far , @entity17 has had 12 reports of children unscrewing the locked caps , including four who ingested the product			0
one child received medical attention			0
the @entity79 is working with the consumer safety commission on the investigation			0
as a precaution , 17 of the products are also being recalled in @entity84			2
the complete listing can be found at the @entity17 website			0
