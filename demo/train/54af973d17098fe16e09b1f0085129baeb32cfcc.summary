@entity0 -- @entity5 's efforts to develop its nuclear program have been stymied by a raft of challenges from international sanctions and set back by the 2010 @entity11 cyberattack , two new reports from a @entity0 nuclear think tank conclude			1
the reports by former weapons inspector @entity15 's @entity14 ( @entity14 ) say @entity5 has been forced to use inferior parts and weaker metals , according to officials the group has spoken to at the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , because sanctions have limited access to needed materials			2
" ten years after the start of construction at the @entity29 enrichment site , the probability that @entity5 will build tens of thousands of centrifuges seems remote based on their faulty performance , " one of the reports notes			1
" even with advanced centrifuges , @entity5 may be blocked by sanctions from building advanced centrifuges in large enough numbers			0
" the @entity29 enrichment site was crippled when a computer virus attacked a portion of the centrifuges			2
but the @entity14 report notes enrichment numbers have rebounded to a higher level than before @entity11 , after a brief dip			0
the @entity20 noted in recent reports , however , that not all the centrifuges are necessarily enriching			0
@entity47 's report says that the @entity11 worm may have decreased the lifespan of aging centrifuges , even if they were not broken right away , by forcing them to spin at altered speeds			0
however , despite the challenges , based on @entity14 assessment of @entity5 's production of enriched uranium , the report concludes the @entity5 have more than enough for the stated goal of providing for its research reactor , and @entity5 appears on a trajectory " to producing weapons - grade uranium for nuclear weapons			1

new reports cite the effects of international sanctions on @entity5 's nuclear efforts
a cyberattack also had a crippling effect on an enrichment site
but @entity5 has more than enough enriched uranium for its research reactor
reports : @entity5 appears on a trajectory " to producing weapons - grade uranium "
