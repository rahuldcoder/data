-- @entity1 has officially banned pornographic content on @entity3 , its year - old social - video service			1
the company announced the changes to its rules and terms of service on thursday and will begin enforcing them immediately			0
just days after @entity3 's official launch in january of last year , reports surfaced about the presence of porn on @entity3 , a service for sharing 6 - second long videos on @entity1 and with other @entity3 users			1
it quickly became a popular spot for short clips of sexually explicit content , some posted by well - known porn stars			1
for the past year , there have been no official rules against pornographic videos , though the company worked to keep them out of the public eye by suppressing them in highly visible places like its editor 's picks and most popular lists			2
it did raise the minimum age for using @entity3 from 12 years old to 17 years old			0
the new rating in @entity38 's @entity37 meant @entity3 carried a disclaimer that warned of " frequent / intense sexual content or nudity			2
" after the initial flurry of concern , the dark corner of @entity3 was mostly forgotten about by people who were n't actively seeking out salacious content , at least until last month , when a young man rose to temporary @entity49 fame when he filmed himself being intimate with a @entity50 and then a @entity51			2
he posted the videos to @entity3 , though they were quickly taken down			2
the timing is likely a coincidence			0
@entity1 said the change in policy is just a matter of the type of content that fits with the @entity3 community			1
" as we 've watched the community and your creativity grow and evolve , we 've found that there 's a very small percentage of videos that are not a good fit for our community , " the company said in a post announcing the new rules			2
the new rules forbid videos of sex acts , whether they 're alone , with other people or with objects			0
sexually explicit animations and nudity are also forbidden			1
however , @entity1 is not blocking all nudity			0
it makes exceptions for any nudity that is documentary , artistic or educational			0
for example , breastfeeding photos will still be allowed , as will shots of " nude protesters			0
" sexually suggestive content is also still welcome , as long as it 's clothed			0
@entity1 is not assembling a full - time vine porn enforcement task force			1
the content will largely be flagged by other @entity3 members using the " report this post " option			1
anyone who violates the new rules will have their account suspended until they delete the offending @entity3			1
repeat posters might have their account permanently suspended			0
@entity1 will contact the users who have already uploaded large volumes of naughty @entity102 and ask them to remove the old content			1
" we 're notifying users who have posted explicit sexual content in the past that they have a period to either take down or download their existing content using a new tool we 've created , " a @entity1 spokesperson said			1
that tool is only available for past porn posters for now .			0
