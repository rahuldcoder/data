out of the political frying pan and into the partisan fire for @entity3 secretary @entity2			1
a day after apologizing and taking responsibility for the problem - plagued @entity6 website , @entity2 got subpoenaed on thursday by one of the fiercest @entity9 critics of the administration -- @entity12 chairman rep. @entity11 of @entity13			1
@entity11 told @entity14 that the subpoena demands documents and information relating to the @entity19 website that his committee previously requested from @entity2 , adding she " answered some questions but evaded a great many			1
" " now we really need to insist on those documents , " he said			2
a spokeswoman for the @entity27 noted last week that @entity11 's committee began requesting a broad range of documents and transcribed interviews during the recent 16 - day government shutdown			0
" while we are working diligently to satisfy their interest and have repeatedly communicated our intent to cooperate , their timeline was not feasible given the vast scope of their requests , " the spokeswoman , @entity33 , said thursday			0
" we are disappointed that the committee believes a subpoena was necessary ; however it does not change our intent to continue to cooperate with them to produce documents as expeditiously as we are able to , " she added			0
meanwhile , some top @entity9 members of the @entity47 sent letters thursday to @entity2 and four contractors involved in the website project requesting documents involving security concerns raised at its hearing a day earlier with the secretary			1
it 's been almost a month since the website for enrolling in president @entity58 's signature health care reforms went live			1
but technical problems , despite a series of advance warning signs , have impeded the system and provoked anger and frustration			0
even after a chorus of apologies out of @entity68 , it may be another month before everything 's running smoothly			0
the federal agency that oversees the troubled website announced thursday it had brought on experts from tech giants @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 to the team working to fix the problems			1
according to a blog post by @entity81 , spokeswoman for the @entity82 , dozens of people were reinforcing the " tech surge " by the administration working on the website issues			1
" they come from leading technology companies such as @entity76 and @entity75 , and include individuals with expertise on site reliability ; stability ; and scalability , " @entity81 's webpost said			1
she identified one of the new additions as @entity96 , a site reliability engineer on leave from @entity74			1
on wednesday , vice president @entity99 became the highest - ranking administration official to apologize for the botched rollout			0
" we assumed that it was up and ready to run , " he told @entity14 's sister network @entity102			0
" but the good news is although it 's not -- and we apologize for that -- we are confident by the end of november it will be , and there 'll still be plenty of time for people to register and get online			0
" that mea culpa came after @entity2 apologized for the " miserably frustrating " problems during a 3 1/2 - hour congressional grilling			2
she said she made a mistake when she told @entity58 that @entity19 was " ready to go " for its october 1 launch			1
@entity2 promised a " vast majority " of consumers will have an easier time shopping online for health insurance under @entity6 by the end of november			2
analysis : @entity2 deals with a difficult day " in these early weeks , access to @entity19 has been a miserably frustrating experience for way too many @entity124 , including many who have waited years , in some cases their entire lives , for the security of health insurance , " @entity2 said			1
she echoed the overall administration stance -- that a team of experts is scrambling to fix the website 's errors			2
to the frustrated users who have had problems , she said : " you deserve better			0
i 'm accountable to you for fixing these problems			0
" 5 things we learned from @entity2 hearing @entity58 tried to log on @entity99 said he did n't even bother logging on to the @entity6 site			1
" actually , the president tried to get online , and my daughter tried to get online , " he said			0
" i did not , because it was clear that i was not getting online			0
" @entity58 himself acknowledged that too many people " have gotten stuck , and i am not happy about it			2
" " there 's no excuse for it , " the president said			0
" and i take full responsibility for making sure it gets fixed asap			1
" glass half full ? @entity2 said the sweeping health care program has delivered on its promise to provide affordable health care coverage			1
thousands have been able to access the website to look at new health coverage options that will give them security of knowing they wo n't go bankrupt if they get sick , she said			2
who is @entity2 ? @entity9 have called for @entity2 to be fired for the @entity6 problems , but a @entity169 spokesman said wednesday that @entity58 has " complete confidence " in her			1
" she took responsibility for many of the problems that are evident with the ( @entity6 ) website , but she also deserves credit for the other aspects of the @entity6 implementation that have gone well , " spokesman @entity171 told reporters			2
in fact , @entity58 tried to turn the tables on @entity9 opponents of his signature health care reforms , challenging them to come up with helpful ideas instead of undermining the federal law			1
" anyone defending the remnants of the old , broken system -- as if it was working for people -- anybody who thinks we should n't finish the job of making the health care system work for everybody ... those folks should have to explain themselves , " he said			0
according to the @entity199 website , 15.4 million people had individual health care coverage in 2011 , representing about 5 % of the population			0
the vast majority of @entity124 have coverage through their employer , @entity82 , @entity204 or other public providers			0
@entity169 spokesman @entity206 said tuesday that " a significant portion " of the 5 % of people with individual coverage will end up paying less for better policies when they shop around in the new exchanges			2
early warning signs some of the criticism surrounding the website 's launch has to do with what @entity58 and other officials knew -- and when they knew it			1
@entity14 has learned the administration received stark warnings a month before the launch that the @entity6 site was not ready to go live , according to a confidential report			0
the caution , from the main contractor @entity226 , warned of risks and issues for @entity19 , even as company executives were testifying publicly the project was on track			2
administration was warned before site launch @entity2 told the @entity234 the outside contractors who built the website never recommended delaying this month 's launch			1
but she conceded that " we did not adequately do end - to - end testing			0
" the contracts with the private companies working on the @entity6 website -- which amount to $ 174 million so far , with more bills due well into 2014 -- do not have " built - in penalties " allowing her department to charge them for disappointing or faulty work , @entity2 said			1
but @entity2 said the agency will not pay for incomplete work			2
security questions @entity9 rep. @entity252 of @entity253 , who chairs the @entity254 , accused @entity2 of putting the private information of @entity124 at risk by failing to properly test security measures on the website			1
" this is a completely unacceptable level of security , " he said			0
" you know it 's not secure			0
" @entity2 responded that testing occurs regularly , and she told @entity252 she would get back to him on whether any end - to - end security test of the entire system has ever occurred			1
@entity252 said he knows there have been no such comprehensive security tests			0
@entity268 warned of high security risk at health care website an internal government memo obtained by @entity14 on wednesday that was written days before the website launched warned of a " high " security risk because of a lack of testing			2
" due to system readiness issues , the ( security control assessment ) was only partly completed , " said the @entity82 memo			0
" this constitutes a risk that must be accepted and mitigated to support the @entity283 1 operations			0
" @entity2 told @entity14 last week that @entity58 did n't know of the problems with the site -- even though insurance companies had complained and the site crashed during a pre-launch test run -- until after it went live			1
a senior administration official said @entity58 now gets a " nightly readout " with the latest @entity6 statistics and an update of the website 's status			1
