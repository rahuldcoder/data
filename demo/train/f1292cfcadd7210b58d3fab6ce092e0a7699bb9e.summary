@entity0 -- more than 700 years after @entity3 died fighting for @entity5 independence , and more than 300 years after @entity5 and @entity6 came together in a @entity7 , a new agreement could lead to an independent @entity5			1
@entity7 prime minister @entity9 and his @entity5 counterpart , first minister @entity10 , signed a deal in @entity12 , @entity5 , on monday paving the way for @entity5 to vote on independence from the @entity7 , @entity9 's office announced on @entity15			1
the referendum , expected to be held in 2014 , would allow @entity5 a straight yes - or - no vote on staying in the union			1
the " @entity24 " campaign launched in may , trying to " build a groundswell of support for an independent @entity5 , " with the backing of several famous @entity5 , most notably actor @entity23			0
@entity10 and his @entity25 ( @entity25 ) , which holds power in the @entity5 parliament , have pushed for the vote			0
a survey released last week by @entity30 showed that only 28 % of @entity5 favor leaving the @entity7			1
that 's somewhat in line with an @entity34 poll of 1,002 @entity5 , taken in late august , that showed sharp political differences within @entity5			0
that survey showed that more than 60 % of @entity25 supporters desire full independence			0
however , only about a third of all the @entity5 polled wanted to break away from the @entity7			1
some detractors have expressed concern about @entity5 's economic viability as an independent state			0
but oil from the @entity45 , off the @entity5 coast , has enriched the @entity7 for decades			1
and the @entity25 , on its website , says independence " could create an environment where our existing and new private industries can grow more easily , " and the party touts a country that retains the @entity7 pound , while its future @entity51 membership creates the benefits of " open borders , shared rights , free trade and extensive cooperation			0
" @entity9 has vocally opposed @entity5 independence			1
in february , he said he was " 100 % clear that i will fight with everything i have to keep our @entity7 together , " since an intact @entity7 , consisting of @entity6 , @entity5 , @entity64 and @entity65 , " is stronger , safer , richer and fairer			2
" in medieval times , @entity5 fought for freedom from @entity6 , which @entity68 dramatically depicted in his @entity70 - winning movie " @entity71			0
" not long after @entity3 died in the early 1300s , @entity72 led @entity5 to independence , and it remained an autonomous nation until the @entity75 joined @entity24 and @entity6 in 1707			2
the @entity7 returned some autonomy to @entity5 , @entity64 and @entity65 , and gave them the right to form their own parliaments , in the late 1990s			2
@entity1 's @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 contributed to this report .			0

brits , @entity5 agree to hold referendum on @entity5 independence
the up - or - down vote will probably *happen* in 2014
@entity7 *pm* @entity9 and most @entity5 polled are against an autonomous @entity5
