-- it 's the greatest magic trick in the world			2
this act of wizardry is performed hundreds of millions of times every day with the press of a button , or more increasingly , with a gentle tap of the screen -- and poof , time stops			2
today , we 're taking and uploading more than 200 million images per day via @entity14 alone			2
our phones have become our recording devices			2
or as i like to see it : my camera can also make calls			2
smartphones have ushered in a golden age for photography			1
but disappointingly , much of the conversation has been focused on the device and the use of faux nostalgic filters rather than on how photographers can choose from a wide range of possibilities to be creative			1
art photography : when reality is n't good enough we must n't forget -- a magician 's props , like a photographer 's choice of camera , are only part of the illusion created			1
when the rabbit is pulled from the hat , its color or breed is irrelevant			2
what 's important is the magician 's ability to artfully make the rabbit appear and ultimately evoke astonishment from the audience			2
in photography , the equivalent is taking an image that evokes strong feelings , regardless of which device captured the picture or its nostalgic hue			1
smartphones have democratized photography , and @entity61 , in particular , has given us an unprecedented platform for our snapshots			1
but instead of marveling at all the choices , there 's some grumbling			2
some professionals feel threatened as they see the playing field leveling ; they interpret it as the end of skill and craft in photography			1
they should have no fear of such a thing			2
12 tips to become a better smartphone photographer photography is rooted in the rich culture of amateurism			1
what 's happening today is similar to the original proliferation of @entity85 's @entity84 camera starting in 1900			0
an inexpensive and easy - to - use camera in every hand did n't usher in the end of photography or automatically turn everybody into @entity91			1
photo apps wo n't magically give @entity93 the smartphone photographer a better sense of composition , or lighting , or framing			1
the apps and filters only change a photo 's look and aesthetic feel			1
that does n't make it a better photo			1
if you put lipstick on a pig , it 's still a pig			0
photographing with a smartphone for me , photography is my memory			1
i 've chosen photography to prove that i exist			1
i see my captured view of the world as my search for meaning			0
for me , words are often inadequate , so i choose to define my experiences with photographs			0
this little act of magic does not divorce me -- as the critic @entity125 implied in her book , " on photography " -- from the here and now			1
in fact , it deepens my bond to the present moment			0
an image i take , sprinkled with synthetic nostalgia , tells all : " i was here and this is what i saw			0
" the camera phone allows me to offer a small taste of my here and now , on unprecedented levels , to a global audience with astonishing immediacy			0
why i use filters the pictures of my childhood had a warmish , faded , slightly out of focus feeling			1
they are the memory of things past , comfort food for the eyes			0
it seems natural for me to add the option of nostalgic filters to my photographic process			1
when we discover an old , faded , cracked and torn image , we handle it with care and respect			0
@entity162 has honored it with its blessing			0
my digital images , however , will never see the ravages of time			0
they 'll always remain , preserved , pristine and forever in their original state , in the perfection of now , without the possibility of the flaws of the past creeping in and eroding it			0
i want my memories , like the prints of my childhood , to fade , to mix with the ether of all that has come before			0
because i know that time can not touch my digital images , i add in the passage of time by using filters			1
embracing the present it is all about time			0
it 's about the time we are losing , and what the future will do to our memories			0
it 's about the fact that technology can instantaneously compress our collective thoughts and images into binary digits of 1 's and 0 's			0
we have a sea of images now			0
on the horizon , i see the forming of a new photographic language			0
let 's embrace photography , as it exists now			2
and let 's continue to find our individual voice , perspectives , stories and style , regardless of the medium			0
