@entity0 , @entity1 -- responding angrily to a campaign ad from @entity5 accusing him of being anti-immigrant , @entity3 insisted during last week 's @entity7 debate at the @entity8 in @entity9 that he has no problem with immigrants			1
but the dishonest and cynical way in which the former governor of @entity14 has dealt with the immigration issue on the campaign trail shows that he has a problem being consistent			1
in @entity20 , @entity18 and @entity19 , @entity3 attacked @entity22 gov. @entity21 and former house speaker @entity5 for immigration proposals that @entity3 said amounted to " amnesty " for illegal immigrants			1
but last week , in @entity1 , where @entity27 account for 22.5 percent of the population , we caught a glimpse of a kinder and gentler @entity3			1
he told the @entity30 , a center - right group , that he would create a " temporary worker permit " for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the @entity33			0
however , @entity3 said , when the permit expires , workers would n't be forced to leave the @entity33			1
instead , they would decide their next move themselves depending on their job prospects			0
his hope is that , at this point , many illegal immigrants would simply " self - deport			0
" good luck with that			0
like former @entity44 sen. @entity43 used to say : " there is nothing more permanent than a temporary worker			0
" people fall in love			0
and it becomes harder to remove them , even if we wanted to			0
besides , it 's not clear that @entity3 wants to remove anyone			1
the idea of voluntary deportation is absurd			0
i bet none of this is going over very well with the voters in the first three primary states who cast their lots for @entity3 , thinking he was going to be tough on illegal immigration only to find out that he does n't even have the stomach to forcibly deport undocumented immigrants			1
maybe @entity3 should ask president @entity69 for pointers			2
the @entity69 administration has deported more than 1.2 million illegal immigrants and offers no apologies			0
meanwhile , in a telenovela unique to the @entity1 primary , a group of @entity75 who supports @entity3 called on @entity79 to yank a commercial labeling the frontrunner " anti-immigrant			1
" a similar request came from @entity1 sen. @entity84 , who while not endorsing @entity3 , defended him against the charge that he was anti-immigrant			1
who does @entity84 think he is ? his own history with the immigration issue is spotty at best			1
in 2011 , @entity84 joined rep. @entity89 of @entity22 in his efforts to require businesses to participate in a government - run " e-verify " program which is supposed to tell them if a social security number is authentic			0
@entity84 also supports the @entity98 immigration law -- and presumably others like it around the country -- which forces local and state law officials to enforce federal immigration statutes			2
in addition , he opposes the @entity105 , which would give legal status to illegal immigrants who go to college or serve in the military because he considers it " part of some broader effort to grant blanket amnesty			0
" last week , in a good speech to the @entity30 , @entity84 acknowledged that many @entity7 -- including himself -- have been slow to condemn anti-immigrant rhetoric from other @entity7			1
still , i do n't care what @entity84 says			0
@entity3 has , in this campaign , advanced a tone that is " anti-immigrant			1
" it was @entity3 who -- bringing back a tactic he used in 2008 against @entity98 sen. @entity123 -- painted @entity21 as soft on illegal immigration			1
@entity3 attacked @entity21 for signing a bill in the @entity22 that allowed undocumented students to attend state colleges and universities and pay in - state tuition rates			2
the narrative that @entity3 pushed was simple : " illegal immigrants are takers			2
they take advantage of in - state tuition rates			0
they take spots in university campuses that should go to @entity33 citizens			0
they take , take , and take some more			0
" never did @entity3 mention all that illegal immigrants contribute to society -- by paying taxes , increasing productivity , creating competition , and doing jobs that @entity33 wo n't do			1
later , with @entity21 vanquished into the single digits , @entity3 used the same line of attack against @entity79 , accusing him of advocating a kind of amnesty for illegal immigrants after @entity79 said that he wanted to provide undocumented workers with a " red card " that allowed them to work legally in the country			2
@entity3 accused @entity79 of letting illegal immigrants take jobs from @entity33 workers			2
now as he competes this week for @entity27 votes in @entity1 -- and , on feb 4 , in @entity158 , where @entity75 account for 26.5 percent of the population -- @entity3 must be hoping that @entity75 have bad memories			1
we never forget a slight			0
and , in that respect , @entity3 has given us plenty to remember			2
follow @entity164 on @entity165 join the conversation on @entity167 the opinions expressed in this commentary are soley those of @entity170			2

@entity170 says @entity3 has been *inconsistent* on the immigration issue
he says that on the campaign trail , @entity3 had advanced a position that is anti-immigrant
@entity170 : but in @entity1 @entity3 has softened his stance
he says that @entity75 do n't forget so easily @entity3 's previous anti-immigrant rhetoric
