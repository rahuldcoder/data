@entity0 -- @entity2 has died in self - imposed exile in @entity4			1
he died , whether in total loneliness , or in his murderer 's company , we do n't yet know , but what we do know is that his death was not natural			2
death could not be natural for him -- he was the most alive , the most active , the most unpacified @entity13 politician			1
police have said that the death was consistent with hanging and that there were no signs of a struggle			0
there is a saying in politics , " any reference in media is beneficial , except obituary			0
" and @entity2 always followed that rule			1
but now it is possible to speak well of the dead , too			0
he was no great mathematician or manager -- but he made up for it with his inventive power and tenacity			0
almost singlehandedly , he helped to reorganize @entity13 industrial giants after years of @entity33 nepotism , inefficiency and degrading service			1
he amassed massive wealth and political influence in the early 1990s during the privatization of @entity13 following the fall of the @entity33			1
just a few years later this " entry - level used car seller , " as the free press of the time had described him , was instrumental in persuading @entity13 business to join forces and encourage then - president @entity42 , despite his poor public standing , to protect the country from a @entity46 return			1
by this time politics had become his main passion but he unwisely allowed his oil and airline companies to be run by partners and assistants whom he had not known for long			0
when he went into opposition and his support started to fall away , he lost much of his money while his former friends and opponents received limitless wealth -- paid for through loyalty to the new political regime			0
the baptized @entity64 very nearly helped to stop the first @entity66 war , by bringing @entity13 general @entity67 and @entity42 together to sign an agreement in @entity69 -- effectively conceding defeat to the small @entity72 nation but the deal would probably have preserved the territorial unity of the country and dozens of thousands of lives			1
later he was instrumental in stitching back together the shreds of the @entity78 ( @entity78 ) , giving autonomy to 11 local kinglets -- that would have guaranteed common trade routes and military collaboration instead of the imperial suppression of the past and the useless dog - poor independence of the present			0
the free press berated @entity2 for both of the projects , accusing him of deriving " private benefits " then of " betraying interests of @entity13 people			1
" president @entity94 ended the second @entity66 war with basically the same agreement -- pulling out @entity13 forces and effecting more than lavish funding of separatist leader @entity99 -- but the press , its freedom already limited , said little to oppose the deal			1
the differences between @entity94 and @entity2 are less significant than many believe , that 's exactly why they worked together so easily			2
both believed in the power of media and money , both longed for the greatness of @entity13 , but neither really believed in the possibility of true people power			2
neither really had a considered opinion on anything -- and were ready to change the views to fit			0
their differences was merely methodological , but the ruins of the great @entity119 that has no religious , ethnic , ideological and cultural unity is a place where people do n't need much to become allies and friends and even less to become enemies for life			0
the last judgement on @entity2 was made while he was still alive , and while many believed much of it was unfair , it was accurate in related details			2
victory in court over his former junior partner @entity134 last year would have meant for @entity2 not just money that ran out within 10 years of opposition activity , but a recognition of being a contributor to the system that provided @entity13 oligarchs with football clubs , yachts and billions of dollars			1
this recognition would have come not just from the left - wing press , but by a civilized @entity146 court from the mouth of @entity148			0
@entity2 was an unregistered shareholder of @entity150 , a @entity13 oil company the government bought back from loyal @entity134 for $ 13 billion			1
he sued @entity134 for $ 5.1 billion , alleging that he was forced to sell his stake for a fraction of its true value			2
but @entity2 did n't just lose a lawsuit and money ; he was refused any recognition , judge @entity157 did n't just judge , she basically impeached @entity2 -- for deception , but what is more degrading -- for self - deception			1
and she was right on this count			0
@entity165 had a lot of charmless features			0
he often did wrong , but his timing was usually good			0
many years before his death , while he still lived in @entity0 , he was leaving the @entity13 parliament , and joked : " englishmen slip away , jews bid farewell , but do not leave , i 'll be an exception , happily			1
" he was an exception : he was both a minion of fortune and its " scapegoat : " he escaped when his time was up , first from the parliament , then from @entity13 , finally from life			2
nobody ever caught him .			0

@entity2 has died in self - imposed exile in @entity4
@entity185 says his friend reorganized @entity13 industry after years of inefficiency
a @entity191 judge gave a *damning* judgment on @entity2 after suing @entity134
