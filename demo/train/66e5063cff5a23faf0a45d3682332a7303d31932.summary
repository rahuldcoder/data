-- two leading @entity2 watchdog groups are denouncing a prominent cartoonist 's illustration about @entity6 's offensive in @entity7 , saying it uses anti-semitic imagery			1
the cartoon was published wednesday in newspapers and on the @entity11			0
the @entity12 , which has been fighting anti-semitism since it was founded in 1913 , called the syndicated cartoon by @entity16 - winning @entity15 " hideously anti-semitic			1
" the @entity17 , which , among other things , fights anti-semitism and educates people about the @entity21 , said " the cartoon mimics the venomous anti-semitic propaganda of the @entity24 and @entity26 eras			1
" published wednesday in newspapers and on the @entity11 , the cartoon shows the small figure of a woman , labeled @entity7 , carrying a child			2
she is being pursued by a headless , jackbooted figure wielding a sword , marching in an apparent goose - step and pushing a fanged @entity2 star on a wheel			1
the @entity12 said the cartoon used " @entity24 - like imagery " and a " hateful evocation of the @entity41			1
" @entity42 , the @entity12 's national director , said the cartoon 's " outlandish and offensive use of the @entity41 in combination with @entity24 - like imagery is hideously anti-semitic			1
" " it employs @entity24 imagery by portraying @entity6 as a jack - booted , goose - stepping headless apparition , " @entity42 said			1
" the implication is of an @entity6 policy without a head or a heart			2
@entity6 's defensive military operation to protect the lives of its men , women and children who are being continuously bombarded by @entity60 rocket attacks has been turned on its head to show the victims as heartless , headless aggressors			1
" the @entity17 , which also issued its statement wednesday , said it urged @entity66 web site and other web sites to remove the cartoon			2
" there is nothing about @entity15 's cartoon not meant to denigrate and demonize the jewish state , from the headless goose - stepping soldier to the horrific depiction of the @entity41 about to devour a cowering innocent @entity7 woman holding a baby , " rabbi @entity69 , the group 's dean , and rabbi @entity72 , the group 's associate dean , said in a joint statement			2
" the imagery in this cartoon mimics the venomous anti-semitic propaganda of the @entity24 and @entity26 eras			1
it is cartoons like this that inspired millions of people to hate in the 1930 's and help set the stage for the @entity24 genocide , " the statement said			1
a spokeswoman for @entity96 , which distributes @entity15 's work , issued a statement defending him , saying he , " like all editorial cartoonists , uses his art to comment on important issues of the day widely reported in the worldwide media -- in this case , the conflict over @entity7			2
that his cartoons sometimes spark intense debate is a testament to his talent			2
" @entity96 said no media outlet had informed the syndicate that it removed the cartoon , but " @entity116 's clients are not contractually bound to inform us			0
" a @entity66 spokeswoman said , " we did not run the cartoon in the newspaper , nor do we plan to do so			0
" she said @entity121 has , by contract with uclick.com , an " @entity116 " button on the cartoons page			0
" yesterday , those who clicked on it saw the cartoon you mentioned , which is now relegated to the @entity116 archive , " she said			0
imagery and rhetoric comparing @entity6 to @entity133 have been deployed by @entity6 's persistent critics , who decry the jewish state 's treatment of @entity137 as oppressive and brutal			1
@entity6 and its supporters defend the state as humane and say it has properly defended itself against attacks			1
there has been sharp criticism of @entity6 's offensive against @entity60 militants in @entity7 who launched rockets into southern @entity6 towns			1
@entity147 said wednesday the @entity6 military 's firing of white phosphorus shells over densely populated areas during the offensive " was indiscriminate and is evidence of war crimes , " a claim denied by @entity6			1
@entity6 has said that @entity60 militants situated themselves among civilians during the offensive			2
@entity15 , who won the @entity16 in 1967 , has been a dominant figure in the editorial cartoon world			2
his work has been distributed since 1980 by @entity96 , which calls the @entity162 native one of the " sharpest , most daring practitioners " among editorial cartoonists			0
he has received many honors , and his cartoons have been exhibited across the world			0
" in 1998 , the @entity168 commemorated the acquisition of 60 of his works with a special exhibition at the @entity168 's @entity173 , " according to an @entity15 biography on the @entity96 web site			0
this is n't the first time @entity15 's cartoons have drawn criticism			0
the @entity183 in 2005 " wrote to the @entity179 and @entity96 to communicate concern over racist depictions of @entity182 , " according to the group 's web site , and the @entity186 criticized offensive stereotypes in cartoons in 1999 , 2001 and 2007			0
debates over offensive editorial cartoons are not uncommon			0
@entity191 , dean of faculty at the @entity193 , a journalism school in @entity194 , @entity195 , was asked to comment on the reaction to the cartoon , whether the cartoon was improper , and at what point in the editorial process an editor can say a product has gone too far			0
he said he understands the positions the @entity2 groups and @entity6 policy critics bring to the table			1
he said he believes @entity15 is saying that " @entity6 is behaving toward the @entity137 the way the @entity133 behaved toward the @entity2 " and that he is stating an opinion shared by many in the @entity210 and the world			1
" i believe that like the caricatures they are , editorial cartoons by their nature exaggerate their messages , so i do n't think @entity15 is suggesting a one - to - one comparison			0
so i get the message , instead , that @entity6 is acting brutally toward the @entity137			0
" he also believes the @entity12 and the @entity17 " are saying that the cartoon is at least doing unintentional harm ( if not more calculated harm )			1
" " i see their point			0
there are symbols -- and the @entity24 extermination of the @entity2 is surely one of them -- that can only truly be analogized to their equals			1
unadulterated evil compared with unadulterated evil			0
@entity6 's ongoing battles with its @entity182 neighbors may be many things , but it is not @entity235			2
" as for the question of how news organizations should handle and discuss such a cartoon , @entity191 said that " @entity15 clearly has the right to provoke or offend			0
the question for him is : do you truly wish to conflate a complex , historic conflict with one of the most evil acts in history ? and for the newspapers that carry the cartoon -- and their behavior here is equally open to critique -- do you wish to perpetuate such a comparison ? "			0
