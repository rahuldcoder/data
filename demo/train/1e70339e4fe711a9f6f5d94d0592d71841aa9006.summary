-- @entity1 and @entity3 users looking with envy at the ever - ballooning screen sizes of @entity7 devices should n't lose hope just yet			1
the @entity9 reports that @entity10 has been experimenting with @entity1 screen sizes larger than the current four inches , echoing rumors from earlier this year that the company may be looking to supplement its current offerings			1
the @entity9 also says that @entity10 is experimenting with larger @entity3 , specifically a model with a gigantic 13 - inch display			1
while a larger @entity1 would be in line with current trends , the trend in tablets has been toward smaller screen sizes , not larger ones			0
in either case , those hoping for a bigger iphone or lap - sized @entity3 should n't necessarily hold their breath			2
@entity10 regularly tests out new screen sizes and even brand - new product lines without ever bringing them to market ; those that do see the light of day can take their time emerging from @entity10 's labs			2
the @entity3 mini itself was the subject of similar speculation in the months and years before it was finally released , and the @entity1 's 4 - inch screen was the subject of rumors that predate the 3.5 - inch @entity40			1
@entity10 is expected to update both the @entity3 and the ipad mini later this year			2
speculation is that the larger tablet will go on the ipad mini diet , shedding some weight , thickness , and bezel width			0
the smaller tablet , on the other hand , may or may not receive a high - resolution @entity49 -- these rumors have been known to change daily based on what the folks at @entity10 rumor sites see in their tea leaves each morning			0
both tablets were last refreshed in november 2012			0
