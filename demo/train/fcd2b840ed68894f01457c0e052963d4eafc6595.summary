-- @entity1 appeared on " @entity2 " today to give his second @entity4 interview — and , once again , he got through the proceedings without directly speaking about the scandal			1
@entity1 appeared a bit more relaxed when chatting with @entity8 than he did monday night on " @entity9			1
" but the heartthrob still stammered and squirmed a bit when @entity8 asked about his personal life , even though @entity13 was never invoked directly			1
@entity8 began by taking a leaf out of @entity16 's book , offering @entity1 some comfort food — in this case , a big box of @entity20 , which is @entity1 's favorite — before getting down to the nitty gritty			1
" everybody just wants to know , how are you doing ? " the @entity2 host asked			2
" and what do you want your fans to know about your personal life ? " @entity1 took a fortifying sip from his mug before giving his answer : " you know , they seem pretty excited about ... whatever , " he said with a grin , indicating the throngs outside the @entity2 studio with a tip of his head			1
" i 'd like my fans to know that ... @entity20 only has 30 calories a bowl in it , for instance , " he continued			0
" pretty much everything that comes out of my mouth is irrelevant			0
" " people read things into it , " @entity8 probed			2
but from there , the conversation got more broad			0
@entity1 reiterated that he only does interviews like this one in order to promote his films , and added that he 's never gotten used to the paparazzi attention he garners : " i think if you start getting used to it , it means you 're going crazy			1
" the host then changed the subject to @entity61 , praising @entity1 's performance as a " master of the universe			1
" ( @entity66 fanboy ? ) @entity1 — who , for the record , still does n't have a publicist — ended the interview by addressing a remark he made to @entity71 yesterday : " the world would be a much better place , i think , if all these bankers and billionaires were followed by paparazzi and studied as carefully			1
" " the weird thing is , i ca n't really tell you what 's interesting about actors either , " he said			2
" people do n't find the personal lives of people with much , much more power than any celebrity would have — do n't find their personal lives interesting			2
i think if you put the lives of people who controlled billions of dollars on the front news of every single paper , the world would be a better place			0
it 's the spin culture			2
if you took away publicists and things and people spoke for themselves , then they 'd have to be responsible for their words			0
" oh , and for the record : @entity20 is 130 calories per serving			0
each bowl does , however , contain just 30 calories from fat			0
