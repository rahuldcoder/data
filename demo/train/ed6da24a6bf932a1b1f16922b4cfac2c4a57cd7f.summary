-- @entity2 soldiers routinely and intentionally put children in harm 's way during their 22 - day offensive against the @entity7 in @entity8 , according to a @entity10 report made public monday			1
on march 6 , a @entity7 boy sits on the rubble of a building destroyed during @entity2 's 22 - day @entity8 offensive			1
the report said a working group had documented and verified reports of violations " too numerous to list			2
" for example , on january 15 , in a town southwest of @entity23 , @entity21 soldiers ordered an 11 - year - old boy to open @entity7 ' packages , presumably so that the soldiers would not be hurt if they turned out to contain explosives , the 43 - page report said			1
they then forced the boy to walk in front of them in the town , it said			0
when the soldiers came under fire , " the boy remained in front of the group , " the report said			1
it said the boy was later released			0
also cited were " credible reports " that accused @entity44 , the militant @entity7 group that runs @entity8 , of using human shields and placing civilians at risk			1
but it singled out the @entity2 for more sweeping criticism			2
a spokesman for the @entity2 prime minister called the report another example of the " one - sided and unfair " attitude of the @entity55 , which requested it			1
the report cited two alleged incidents from january 3			0
in one , it said , after a tank round struck near a house , a father and his two sons -- both younger than 11 -- emerged to look at the damage			0
" as they exited their home , @entity21 soldiers shot and killed them ( at the entrance to their house ) , with the daughter witnessing , " the report said			2
in the second , it said , " @entity2 soldiers entered a family house in the @entity74 neighborhood of @entity23			1
standing at the doorstep , they asked the male head of the household to come out and shot him dead , without warning , while he was holding his id , hands raised up in the air , and then started to fire indiscriminately and without warning into the room where the rest of the family was huddled together			0
" the eldest son was shouting in vain the word ' children ' in @entity89 to warn the soldiers			2
the shooting did not stop until everyone was lying on the floor			0
the mother and four of the brothers , aged 2 - 12 years , had been wounded , one of them , aged 4 , fatally			0
" the alleged instances occurred during @entity99 , which was launched december 27 to halt rocket attacks into southern @entity2 from @entity8 and ended january 17 with a cease - fire			1
the @entity10 report called the response by @entity2 disproportionate			1
of the 1,453 people estimated killed in the conflict , 1,440 were @entity7 , including 431 children and 114 women , the report said			2
the 13 @entity2 killed included three civilians and six soldiers killed by @entity44 , and four soldiers killed by friendly fire , it said			1
the report said the @entity2 operation resulted in " a dramatic deterioration of the living conditions of the civilian population			1
" it cited " targeted and indiscriminate " attacks on hospitals and clinics , water and sewage treatment facilities , government buildings , utilities and farming and said the offensive " intensified the already catastrophic humanitarian situation of the @entity7 people			2
" it said @entity2 strikes damaged more than 200 schools and left more than 70,000 people homeless			2
" there are strong and credible reports of war crimes and other violations of international norms , " it said , adding that many observers have said war crimes investigations should be undertaken			0
" the alternative is de facto impunity , " it said			0
it called for the end of @entity2 's blockade of @entity8 and the free passage into the territory of food , medicine , fuel and construction supplies			1
@entity156 , a spokesman for @entity2 prime minister @entity157 , called the report " another example of the one - sided and unfair attitude of the rapporteur of the @entity55 , a council that has been criticized by current and previous secretaries - general for its unbalanced attitudes toward @entity2			1
" he added , " the negative fixation on @entity2 by the council has done a disservice to the issue of human rights internationally as has been attested to by the leading @entity169 's [ nongovernmental organizations ] on human rights			1
" another report issued monday also was critical of the @entity21			0
the report from @entity173 said the @entity8 incursion violated @entity21 's own code of ethics			2
the report by the medical group , which shared the 1997 @entity179 , cited instances where it said @entity21 forces did not evacuate injured civilians for days and prevented @entity7 teams from reaching the wounded , and said some of them died as a result			0
it said 16 @entity7 medical personnel were killed by @entity21 fire and 25 were wounded during the @entity21 operation , and accused the @entity21 of attacking 34 medical centers in violation of the @entity21 's own " ethical code for fighting terror			0
" in response , the @entity21 accused @entity44 of having used medical vehicles , facilities and uniforms to conceal its members ' activity			1
" @entity44 used ambulances to ' rescue ' terror activists from the battlefield and used hospitals and medical facilities as hiding places , " the @entity2 said in a written statement			1
" despite this , throughout the fighting , @entity21 forces were instructed to avoid firing at ambulances , even if they were being used by armed fighters			0
they were instructed only to shoot if there was fire towards our forces emanating from the direction of the ambulance			0
" regarding the reported delays in casualty evacuations , " there existed real difficulties in evacuating the injured , due to the roadblocks , booby - trapped roads and dirt mounds placed by the @entity44 as well as the considerable damage to the infrastructure , " the statement said			1
nevertheless , it said , an @entity21 investigation is ongoing and its conclusions will be made public once it is complete			0
but dr. @entity233 , @entity173 - @entity2 chairman , was skeptical that the investigation would prove useful			1
" there are considerable doubts that the @entity21 is the correct institution to investigate suspicions of these violations , " he said			0
" the @entity21 's repeated promises to the @entity239 to look into attacks on medical teams and medical centers have gone unfulfilled , and there are suspicions concerning its seriousness and readiness to carry out the matter			2
" the @entity2 military did accept criticism monday on another matter -- the practice of some @entity2 soldiers of wearing t - shirts that appear to condone acts of violence against @entity7			1
the @entity2 daily @entity257 newspaper reported that @entity2 soldiers who had finished basic training ordered the shirts , one of which showed a pregnant @entity263 in the crosshairs of a gun sight with a caption reading " 1 @entity267			1
" another showing a small child in a gun 's sight was captioned , " the smaller they are , the harder it is			0
" " the examples presented by @entity257 reporter are not in accordance with @entity21 values and are simply tasteless , " the @entity2 military said in a written statement			2
" this type of humor is unbecoming and should be condemned			0
" @entity2 soldiers said last week that @entity7 civilians were killed and @entity7 property intentionally destroyed during @entity2 's military campaign in @entity8 , according to @entity257			1
the @entity21 has said it is investigating the claims , but its top general expressed skepticism monday			0
" i do n't believe that soldiers serving in the @entity21 hurt civilians in cold blood , but we shall wait for the results of the investigation , " lt. gen. @entity286 , the chief of staff , said in a speech			0
" i tell you that this is a moral and ideological army			0
" he blamed @entity44 for choosing " to fight in heavily populated areas			2
" it ( was ) a complex atmosphere that includes civilians and we took every measure possible to reduce harm of the innocent , " he said , according to an @entity21 statement .			0
