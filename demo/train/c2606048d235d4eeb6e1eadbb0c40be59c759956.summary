-- former fbi director @entity2 's investigation into possible wrongdoing at @entity4 appears to be examining football coach @entity6 's apparent preference for handling scandalous issues internally , and what role that may have played in a potential cover - up involving former defensive coordinator @entity10 , convicted on 45 counts of child sex abuse on june 22			1
@entity2 's group has been poring over internal @entity4 e-mails and has interviewed a past university official about the way @entity6 influenced a variety of disciplinary matters , according to a source with knowledge of the investigation			1
@entity2 is leading an internal review of @entity4 's handling of the scandal that is unrelated to criminal investigations			1
the e-mails obtained by @entity0 from a source familiar with the investigation , and first reported by the @entity29 , show @entity6 wielded power that went well beyond the realm of football or even the athletic department			1
e-mails cast a pall on @entity4 's @entity6 in a 2005 e-mail from dr. @entity38 , then vice president of student affairs in charge of disciplining students , to athletic director @entity42 and others , she summarizes a meeting they had with @entity6 in which he tells her that he wants to be the sole disciplinarian of his players			1
she criticizes @entity6 for wanting to limit the @entity48 to incidents that take place on campus and keeping disciplinary matters involving his players private			1
" coach @entity6 would rather we not inform the public when a football player is found responsible for committing a serious violation of the law and / or our student code -- despite any moral or legal obligation to do so , " according to her e-mail			1
in the same e-mail , @entity38 , also refers to calls her office was receiving from coaches and others			0
" i must insist that the efforts to put pressure on ( @entity70 ) and try to influence our decisions ... simply must stop , " she writes			0
@entity42 , in a subsequent e-mail , acknowledges that @entity38 's take on the conversation with @entity6 is accurate			1
@entity38 replies to @entity42 , " i know you are caught in the middle of a very difficult situation , " an apparent reference to appeasing @entity6			2
in a subsequent e-mail to then - @entity4 president @entity80 she is more blunt : " i am very troubled by the manipulative , disrespectful , uncivil and abusive behavior of our football coach , " she writes			1
@entity38 has been interviewed by the @entity2 group , according to a source with knowledge of the investigation			1
in the same e-mail , she calls @entity6 's behavior " atrocious " and said others are mimicking his behavior			2
" it is quite shocking what this man -- who is idolized by people everywhere -- is teaching our students ... " she writes			0
@entity38 's e-mails may be a sign @entity2 is also examining the culture around the football team as his investigators work to determine the circumstances surrounding a 2001 sexual incident with a young boy and @entity10 in a @entity4 shower room and reported by then graduate assistant coach @entity107			1
in purported 2001 e-mails between @entity42 , @entity109 , and @entity80 , read exclusively to @entity0 , @entity42 appears to change his mind about reporting the locker room incident to outside authorities after speaking to @entity6 , he wrote in one e-mail			1
@entity10 was convicted in june of four counts related to the 2001 shower incident , including unlawful contact with minors , a first - degree felony			0
@entity42 and former @entity4 vice president @entity119 face perjury and failure to report child abuse charges in connection with the @entity10 case			2
they have pleaded not guilty			0
disturbing e-mails could spell more trouble for @entity4 officials in 2007 , after a widely reported incident where more than a dozen players crashed an off - campus party and started a violent brawl , @entity6 appears to send an e-mail , through his assistant , to @entity80 that says , " i want to make sure everyone understands that the discipline of the players involved will be handled by me as soon as i am comfortable that i know all the facts			1
" @entity6 's attorneys have said the coach did n't use e-mail			2
the exchange shows while he may not have had his own e-mail account , his assistant would still send e-mails for him			2
@entity6 planned to punish the team by forcing them to perform 10 hours of community service and clean up the stadium after home games , according to a memo provided by a source familiar with the investigation			2
after @entity38 tried to discipline football players in the same manner as other students , she was harassed both online and at her home , according to a source with knowledge of the investigation			0
on her front lawn somebody put up a " for sale " sign			0
police installed a surveillance camera			0
in the end , the source says @entity80 suggested she think about her future at @entity4 , and she resigned			0
after @entity38 left @entity4 , the university changed its discipline policy involving off - campus incidents			0
its current code of conduct says it only applies to " off campus conduct that affects a @entity177 interest			0
" the @entity2 goup and the university declined comment on this story			0
efforts sunday night to obtain a comment from the @entity6 family were unsuccessful			0
@entity6 died of complications from lung cancer in january			0
the 2001 , 2005 , and 2007 e-mail exchanges are among many now under investigation by the @entity2 group			1
the e-mails revealed so far suggest coach @entity6 preferred to handle bad behavior internally , a preference that may have influenced a decision by university officials not to report @entity10 to authorities in 2001 and allowed him to continue to abuse young boys			2
victim no. 6 : violation and vindication in police interview , @entity201 describes abuse @entity204 replaces @entity10 image ; @entity4 looks to cases ahead painful chapter closes with @entity10 's conviction for child sex abuse			0
