suspicion that a @entity1 citizen was involved in the deadly @entity5 attack in @entity6 last month " has been strengthened " but is not yet confirmed , @entity1 's security service said			1
the @entity1 citizen , said to be of @entity8 origin , is believed to have ties to @entity10 , known as @entity11 , who is regarded as one of the most dangerous commanders in the @entity8 terror group @entity14			1
the @entity1 security service , @entity15 , said its investigations in @entity1 and @entity6 were ongoing , and that despite some media outlets reporting a name for the possible @entity1 suspect , it was not ready to confirm his identity			1
" it has not yet been determined whether a named @entity1 citizen actually took part in the attack or not , " a @entity15 statement said friday			1
" based on the information that we have uncovered this far in the investigation , however , the suspicion of his involvement has been strengthened			2
" it has also not yet been determined whether the person in question is still alive , the statement said			0
@entity6 counter terrorism sources said @entity1 intelligence services in @entity6 were investigating both @entity38 and the @entity1 citizen and have spoken to the latter 's sister in @entity1			1
but @entity42 , head of communications for the @entity15 , told @entity44 on saturday that the two @entity1 officers currently in @entity6 are not investigating @entity11 , only the @entity1 citizen and his connections with @entity14 , as they seek to establish whether he was in @entity6			1
he said the citizen 's name would be disclosed by @entity1 authorities only if he 's confirmed to be one of the gunmen killed in the mall attack , or if they have sufficient evidence to issue an international warrant for his arrest			1
@entity42 said investigators were also questioning people in @entity1			2
@entity6 authorities suspect @entity11 , also wanted by the @entity60 , of involvement with the @entity5 attack			1
@entity14 claimed responsibility for the bloody four - day siege at the upscale mall in @entity66 , where at least 67 people died			2
the @entity69 group claimed another deadly attack saturday , this time in the town of @entity72 , in central @entity8			0
@entity8 police officer @entity73 told @entity44 at least 20 people were killed in the suicide blast at a cafe , although other officials gave a lower death toll			0
@entity79 , deputy governor of @entity81 province , said seven government soldiers were among the dead			0
@entity14 said it was targeting @entity8 and @entity85 army commanders in the area			2
@entity87 of @entity60 raid @entity60 officials said @entity11 was the target of a raid earlier this month by @entity92 on an @entity14 compound near the town of @entity95 in @entity8			2
it 's believed that he escaped after the @entity60 troops came under heavy fire			2
a @entity6 intelligence dossier seen by @entity44 alleges @entity101 's involvement with briton @entity102 , a terror suspect known as the " @entity102 , " in a foiled @entity104 attack in 2011 with @entity105 , a fellow @entity106 citizen currently held in @entity104 on terror charges			1
@entity6 intelligence sources say that @entity38 , who speaks six languages and grew up in @entity6 , is the main " point person " between @entity114 in @entity8 and @entity115 , and that he has helped pinpoint @entity6 targets			1
friends of @entity38 who knew him from his time growing up on the @entity66 suburb of @entity120 told @entity44 he traveled to @entity1 in 2003 and grew increasingly radicalized there			1
the sources , who had kept up with him over the years , said @entity11 traveled in 2007 to @entity123 , where they lost contact with him			0
in 2008 they heard he was in @entity8 , where he has been based since			0
@entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 are among the six languages spoken by @entity38 , and he studied @entity130 for two years at the @entity131 in @entity66 , his friends say			2
@entity14 's growing reach the possible involvement of the @entity1 citizen in the @entity5 attack has highlighted concerns about the widening reach of @entity14 outside @entity8 borders			1
@entity6 counterterror sources told @entity44 that security camera footage of the attackers inside the mall shows them talking by cellphone to people apparently outside the mall -- who the sources believe were giving the gunmen instructions			1
telephone intercepts have led all over the region , from @entity153 to @entity8 and even possibly to @entity115 , the sources said			0
as for the @entity1 connection , many people have traveled from @entity156 to @entity8 to join @entity14 , @entity44 terrorism analyst @entity157 said			1
the leader of @entity14 has been following a strategy aimed at transforming it from a regional insurgent outfit into a terrorist group , @entity157 said			2
@entity11 , who is thought to have spent four years in @entity1 , appears to be central to that strategy , he said			2
he managed to escape the raid by @entity92 , " so the concern now is that his credentials really will be burnished in the jihadist community globally , and he will be emboldened to commit more attacks potentially in the region , " @entity157 said			0
@entity11 told a western intelligence informant several years ago that one of his key goals was to carry out attacks back in the @entity173 , using recruits from @entity176 nations who 'd come to @entity8 for training			0
he is believed to be a key link figure between different terrorist groups including @entity114 and @entity115 , and may have key intelligence on future plots			0
@entity1 suspect @entity183 , a security expert based in @entity1 and author of the book " @entity14 in @entity8 , " told @entity44 that if the @entity1 suspect is who he believes him to be , he lived in a small town in @entity1 but had connections with a wider group , not all of @entity8 origin			1
he came to @entity1 at age 8 or 9 and stayed for a couple of years , during which time he gained @entity1 citizenship , @entity183 said			0
he later returned to @entity8			0
@entity14 became quite popular among some @entity8 community groups in @entity1 from 2007 to 2009 , @entity183 said , " because they were wrongly seen as some kind of national resistance group			1
" observers noticed contradictions between what the group said in its @entity127 - and arabic - language messaging , he said , which contributed to ignorance within the diaspora about its real nature			0
" but the terrorist attacks inside of @entity8 made it easier for the wider ethnic @entity8 community to see that this was really a terrorist organization , and it distanced itself , " he said , making it less popular now			0
however , this development brought its own problems , @entity183 said , and not just in @entity1			0
" what you have to look out for , also in the @entity60 and the @entity106 and all these other @entity156 countries , are these small , small networks that are in one sense detached also from the @entity8 community leaders -- radicalized groups of youths and radical preachers , sheikhs , that go traveling around the various countries to try to incite , " he said			0
" that 's what we have to watch these days			0

@entity1 's security service is investigating in @entity6 and @entity1
