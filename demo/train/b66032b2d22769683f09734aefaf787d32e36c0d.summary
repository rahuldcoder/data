-- what on @entity2 would drive a man to swim in @entity5 waters wearing nothing but @entity7 , goggles and a cap ? @entity10 braves the icy water off the arctic archipelogo of @entity13			1
for @entity10 , it was a love of the environment and a passionate desire to save the @entity5 from global warming			1
his 1 km swim ( 0.62 of a mile ) in 2007 made him the first person to complete a long - distance swim at the @entity20 -- the purpose , to highlight the fact that it was possible to swim for a kilometer in a place that should be solid ice			1
@entity10 , now aged 39 , is a former maritime lawyer who abandoned his practice six years ago to become a full - time environmentalist and adventurer			2
since then he has become the first person to complete long - distance swims in all five of the world 's oceans and has become the world 's leading cold water swimmer			1
born in @entity33 and brought up in @entity34 , @entity10 sees himself in the mould of pioneering @entity37 adventurers like sir @entity38 , fearlessly braving waters no one else would dare swim			2
but rather than just aiming for a place in the history books , his motivation is to publicize the environmental damage he has witnessed on his swims			2
in 2006 , to raise awareness about global warming and that year 's drought in @entity33 , @entity10 swam the entire length of the @entity51 -- all except the first 26 miles , which had already dried up			1
he took a break from the 200 - mile journey to call in at no. 10 @entity55 , where he discussed climate change with @entity57			0
the next year , @entity10 became the first person to swim the 87 mile - width of the @entity59			1
the 10 - day swim was @entity10 's way of raising awareness of how climate change is threatening to submerge low - lying islands			2
but he is best known for his @entity20 adventure			0
his @entity5 swim lasted 19 minutes in temperatures of around minus 2 degrees @entity68			2
were any normal person to fall into waters that cold they would be in serious trouble			0
@entity10 's long - time coach professor @entity73 told @entity0 , " people usually drown very quickly on exposure to cold water because they start to hyperventilate and when you hyperventilate you ca n't coordinate			1
they inhale water and they ca n't coordinate their swimming			1
most people ca n't even go 20 meters if they are exposed to ice - cold water			1
" but @entity10 has developed a unique mechanism for overcoming freezing conditions			0
he is apparently able to increase his body temperature by will power alone			1
in a process that @entity73 has dubbed " anticipatory thermogenesis " , @entity10 can raise his body temperature to a feverish 38.4 c , some 1.5 degrees above normal body temperature			1
@entity73 first noted this extraordinary ability during a training session			0
before entering the water , @entity10 cast his mind back to a traumatic parachuting accident he witnessed when he was a soldier in the @entity37 army , reliving the event in detail			2
@entity73 recorded an increase in @entity10 's body temperature and over the next fortnight , as @entity10 was exposed to more cold - water swims , he was able to increase his temperature even further , peaking at 38.4 @entity68 these days , before @entity10 braves sub-zero waters he listens to @entity102 , gets himself into an aggressive state of mind and drives up his internal temperature			1
once he hits the water , it 's all about mental strength			0
@entity73 told @entity0 " the moment you dive into cold water your temperature drops and the brain sends a message to get out of the water			1
the first thing @entity10 has to do is control that response			0
what happens is that i become his brain , so he says ' fine , as long as dr @entity73 allows me to swim , it 's safe and i must just ignore what my brain is telling me			0
' " achieving that level of willpower does n't come easily			0
while @entity10 does an hour of cold - water swimming a day , he devotes four hours a day to mind training			1
his technique is to visualize his swim from beginning to end			0
" i can taste salt water in my mouth			0
i can hear the sounds of the engines , of @entity73 screaming at me			0
i can feel ice burning my skin , i can smell the sea air			0
i absolutely live that moment			0
i have swum the @entity20 hundreds of times in my mind , " he told @entity0			0
if the @entity5 swim was intended to highlight shrinking polar ice caps , @entity10 acknowledges that there 's still plenty of work to do on that front and he now speaks on environmental issues all over the world			1
in 2008 @entity10 founded the @entity149 with the aim of protecting the @entity5 and of encouraging world leaders to take action to stop climate change			2
as well the risk of polar melting , @entity10 sees an @entity5 treaty as essential to prevent the exploitation of the @entity20 for oil and gas			2
as @entity10 put it after completing his @entity5 swim , " i 'm relieved that it 's over			1
now the real work begins			0

@entity10 was the first man to complete a long - distance swim in the @entity5
" most people ca n't go 20 meters in ice - cold water , " says his coach
@entity10 is able to increase his body temperature using will power alone
his extreme swims are intended to publicize the effects of global warming
