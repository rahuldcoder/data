@entity0 -- @entity3 nominee @entity2 told the @entity4 on monday that justices on the nation 's highest court should be even - handed and impartial in order to promise " nothing less than a fair shake for every @entity11			1
" in her opening statement to her confirmation hearing , @entity2 sought to address @entity15 concerns that her background as an academic and policy specialist in the @entity19 administration would bring a liberal bias in her court rulings			1
the role of the @entity3 is " to safeguard the rule of law , through a commitment to even - handedness , principle , and restraint , " @entity2 said			2
" i will make no pledges this week other than this one -- that if confirmed , i will remember and abide by all these lessons , " she said after describing her experiences as a @entity3 clerk , law school professor and @entity11 solicitor general			2
" i will listen hard , to every party before the court and to each of my colleagues			0
and i will do my best to consider every case impartially , modestly , with commitment to principle , and in accordance with law			0
" if confirmed by the 19 - member committee and then the full @entity4 , @entity2 would be the 112th @entity3 justice and the fourth woman to sit on the nation 's highest court			1
while her confirmation is considered likely , @entity15 senators on the panel questioned monday whether @entity2 can be an impartial justice , displaying a partisan divide over president @entity55 's second @entity3 nomination since he took office in january 2009			1
the @entity4 confirmed @entity55 's first candidate , @entity57 , last year			0
the committee 's seven @entity15 used their opening statements to challenge @entity2 's judicial experience and her ability to put aside personal politics , and the 12 @entity64 members praised @entity2 's qualifications and welcomed her possible presence on a court they criticized for what they called conservative activism			1
@entity2 sat impassively in the packed room , sometimes taking a sip of water , as the senators outlined the questioning she will face in coming days			0
committee chairman sen. @entity75 , @entity76 , said @entity2 would be an independent @entity3 justice , and that he advised her to be open in expressing her judicial philosophy at her confirmation hearing			1
citing her record as the first woman to be dean of @entity83 and the first woman solicitor general of the @entity11 , @entity75 said @entity11 is " a better country for the fact that the path of excellence @entity2 has taken in her career is one now open to both men and women			0
" however , the ranking @entity15 on the panel , sen. @entity92 of @entity93 , said @entity2 lacks judicial experience and has a record of supporting liberal political causes			2
" while academia certainly has value , there is no substitute , i think , for being in the harness of the law , handling real cases , " @entity92 said			0
other republicans said @entity2 's experience as a clerk for @entity108 indicated she would seek to push society toward desired ideological or political ends , rather than apply existing law			1
" will the @entity114 control her , or will she try to control the @entity114 ? " asked sen. @entity112 , @entity113			0
" does she believe that judges may control the @entity114 by changing its meaning ? " @entity64 sen. @entity117 of @entity118 accused @entity15 of casting a " drift net " for any disqualifying fact in @entity2 's record , saying the @entity15 effort failed			1
" i believe you are eminently confirmable , " @entity117 said , turning the tables on @entity15 concerns about @entity2 's lack of judicial experience by saying : " frankly , i find this refreshing			1
" other democrats harshly criticized the current @entity3 for what they characterized as rulings based on conservative activism			0
they cited the @entity134 ruling in january , in which the high court voted 5 - 4 to give big businesses , unions and nonprofits more power to spend freely in federal elections , which they said threatens a century of government efforts to regulate the power of corporations to bankroll @entity11 politics			0
sen. @entity147 , @entity149 - @entity148 , called the @entity3 's shift to the right under chief justice @entity152 " palpable			2
" " in decision after decision , this court bends the law to suit " a conservative political ideology , @entity147 said , calling @entity2 " a terrific antidote to the lack of practical real - world understanding of the court			0
" however , @entity15 sen. @entity15 of @entity162 said @entity2 's record is full of " warning signs " that she may be what he called a " results - oriented " justice -- which is conservative code language for liberal activism			1
citing her record as clerk for @entity171 , @entity15 said many of her memos then " appeared to be based largely on her own liberal political views			0
" " this kind of naked political judgment appears frequently throughout @entity2 's work as a @entity3 clerk , " @entity15 said			1
@entity64 sen. @entity180 of @entity181 responded that @entity11 is a better nation due to @entity171 's personal empathy in ruling on influential civil rights cases			2
" our @entity3 is badly in need of a person of your skill and knowledge and background , " @entity180 said .			0
