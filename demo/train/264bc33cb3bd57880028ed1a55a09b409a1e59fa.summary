-- the july 20 shooting spree at a midnight screening of " @entity3 " in @entity4 , @entity5 , seems ultimately to have had a relatively modest impact on the release of the superhero blockbuster , at least in terms of its box - office performance			1
but it has thrown a major wrench into @entity15 ' plans for another film , the upcoming action - drama " @entity17			1
" in the immediate wake of the shooting , the studio pulled the trailers for the film , which — in a grisly unintended echo of the @entity4 tragedy — featured a scene of mobsters bursting through a movie screen and firing machine guns at people seated in a movie theater			1
days later , the studio and director @entity33 ( " @entity34 " ) decided to cut , or at least extensively rework , that scene			0
given that the movie - theater - gangland - massacre sequence was a key plot point in the film — which stars @entity38 and @entity39 as @entity41 cops assigned to take down real - life 1940s mob kingpin @entity43 ( @entity44 ) — any changes to it inevitably would necessitate script revisions and reshoots , jeopardizing the film 's planned sept. 7 release date			2
now a source confirms that @entity15 is pulling the film off of the fall schedule			2
no new date has been determined yet , though according to the @entity55 , the studio is eyeing dates in january as a possibility			0
@entity15 declined to comment on the decision , but clearly moving the film will both allow the filmmakers the time required to make changes to the movie and give the studio an opportunity to reboot a marketing campaign that was derailed by horrible circumstances no one could have foreseen			1
