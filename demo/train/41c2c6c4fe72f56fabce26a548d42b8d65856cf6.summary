-- the head of world football 's global governing body has criticized @entity5 soccer for not cracking down hard enough on a team whose fans racially abused an opposition player			1
sunday 's goalless draw between @entity10 and @entity11 at the @entity13 stadium was brought to a halt for several minutes after visiting fans directed abuse at home striker @entity17			1
the @entity18 fined @entity11 $ 65,000 , which prompted a forthright response from @entity20			1
" what is surprising and is not understandable for me , is that the disciplinary committee of the @entity26 has taken a decision , not even 24 hours after the event , by just imposing a fine , " @entity20 told @entity22 's official website			1
" they have not made any investigation of what happened			0
and just to give a pecuniary sanction is not valid , that is not acceptable			0
" you will always find money			0
what is $ 65,000 for such an incident ? i 'm not happy and i will call the @entity18			1
that 's not a way to deal with such matters			0
" in response , the @entity18 said it was acting within existing regulations but hopes that an agenda tabled at @entity47 's @entity46 meeting in @entity48 later this month will enable it to take tougher measures			1
on may 24 , members of the @entity52 governing will vote on a proposal to introduce a minimum 10 - match sanction for any discriminatory offenses -- a ruling which could apply to all @entity47 competitions from as early as july if passed			0
" the @entity47 @entity59 will determine new deterrents that will go from imposing a fine to the total closure of a venue , " said @entity18 president @entity58			1
" these new rules will be received by our code of @entity67 once approved from ( the start of ) the 2013/2014 season			0
" speaking to @entity5 media on monday , @entity58 's views on the ineffectiveness of financial sanctions tallied with those of @entity20			1
" fines are not penalizing , " he said			0
he added that his body wishes to close parts of a stadium where " episodes of racism take place " before taking the more drastic measure of playing matches without fans should incidents persist			2
the club at the center of the row has also stated its desire to eradicate an issue that @entity58 says is damaging the image of @entity5 football			2
" @entity11 condemns any form of racial abuse , " the @entity94 club said on monday			1
" this type of behavior from any football supporters , including ours , is completely unacceptable			2
" we are committed to facing this issue head - on to rid our sport of this problem and promote respect for all			0
" the newly - created @entity22 anti-racism task force met for the first time earlier this month and proposed placing officials at matches in order to " identify potential acts of discrimination " , a suggestion that will be voted on by @entity22 's members later this month			2
" it is incredible , that we had such incidents especially in the @entity94 in the @entity13 between @entity10 and @entity11 , a very important match , " continued @entity20 , who has been head of world football 's governing body since 1998			1
" the referee had to stop the match for a few minutes in order to bring back calm			2
this is bad , because we are just holding this task force against racism			2
" @entity11 's sanction is not the first suffered by an @entity5 club this season			1
last month , @entity131 were fined nearly $ 60,000 by @entity52 governing body @entity47 after its fans were found guilty of " improper conduct " in chants directed towards @entity136 striker @entity135			1
in february , @entity137 received its fourth charge of racist behavior this season -- with @entity11 's city rivals having been fined nearly $ 300,000 after repeated fan transgressions			1
on monday , @entity10 chief executive officer @entity142 was quoted by @entity5 newspaper @entity143 as saying : " just as violence at football grounds was eliminated , racist chanting can also be stopped if there is the necessary will			1
" the task force was created after a series of incidents of racist abuse which have blighted the sport in recent years			0
@entity17 's @entity10 teammate @entity154 , a member of the task force , walked off following racist chanting during an exhibition match against lower division team @entity156 in january			1
the @entity157 has also had to deal with racism cases			0
@entity160 's @entity159 and @entity162 's @entity161 were fined and received lengthy bans for two separate offenses which occurred in 2011			0
the @entity165 ( @entity165 ) is due to vote this week on the introduction of a minimum five - game ban for any incident of racist abuse , which is half the proposed tally outlined by @entity47			2
" we do n't have to follow @entity47 , " @entity165 chairman @entity169 was reported to have said by @entity171 newspaper @entity170			0
" ours is a very detailed and thought - out proposal			0
it is not likely to be exactly in line with @entity47 's			0
" ours will have a minimum but it will have a clear acceleration from that minimum			0
we may well yet go beyond the 10			0
