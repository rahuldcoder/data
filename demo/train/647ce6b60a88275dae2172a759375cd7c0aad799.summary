-- soccer stars will face a more systematic regime of drug testing following world governing body @entity5 's decision to introduce biological profiles for players			1
the move comes as global sport is trying to crack down on drug cheats in the wake of recent doping scandals			1
@entity15 's loss of his seven @entity17 titles , followed by his admission of using performance - enhancing substances in an interview with @entity22 , brought the problem of drug use by athletes to worldwide attention			0
and last week @entity27 was stunned by a government report which alleged many professional athletes are using forbidden drugs often supplied by organized crime groups			0
in @entity34 , the @entity33 trial is now underway following an investigation , which began in 2006 , into the widespread doping network operated by dr. @entity37			0
now @entity5 is taking steps to address any possible use of banned substances within football , announcing its plan to bring in biological profiles following discussions between president @entity45 and his @entity46 ( @entity46 ) counterpart @entity47 on thursday			1
the profiles , similar to the biological passports used within cycling , will first be run at june 's @entity51 -- a warmup tournament for the @entity53 , also being held in @entity54			1
biological profiles are built up by collating an athlete 's drug test results over time , therefore making it easier to detect differences which could indicate the use of a banned substance			0
" we are very interested in continuing the work on biological profiles , " @entity47 said in a @entity5 statement released friday			2
" @entity46 is very satisfied with the commitment of @entity5 on the biological profiles , which will be run not only at the @entity68 in 2014 but already at the @entity51 in june this year			1
" in an interview with @entity0 , @entity47 said he saw no reason why football and other major team sports could n't introduce biological profiles			1
" i would like to see , particularly team sports , take up the athlete 's biological passport , " said @entity47			1
" there is absolutely no reason why not in the major codes of football , and in the major sporting events right throughout the world			0
" that will do a lot to stamp out doping in sport , and most of those major codes can easily afford the cost of running ( a biological passport ) program and doing it well			2
" @entity5 said a total of 662 urine samples had been taken across different competitions last year , namely the @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity54 2014 qualifiers and men 's and women 's @entity99 football tournaments			1
" to date , there has been one adverse analytical finding at a @entity68 qualifier in october 2012 , " read the @entity5 statement			2
" we have been testing this at the @entity96 in 2011 and 2012 , we will continue at the @entity51 2013 with blood testing unannounced at training camps and games , " said @entity5 's @entity107 chairman dr. @entity106			0
" and it 's our commitment to have all players participating at the 2014 @entity68 having biological profiles			0
" @entity5 said doping controls will be in place at 114 of the 820 qualifying matches for @entity54 2014 played worldwide , with 456 samples being taken			1
" at these selected matches , four players are to undergo a doping control and out of those selected , one is drawn for @entity125 , " continued the statement			0
@entity125 is a hormone which aids the production of red blood cells , helping athletes train harder for longer			0
" there is always more which can be done in the fight against doping , but we know @entity5 has always been serious in this domain , " added @entity47 in the statement			2
" we think the leagues can complement what @entity5 is already doing , but we came here to thank @entity5 for its collaboration			0
