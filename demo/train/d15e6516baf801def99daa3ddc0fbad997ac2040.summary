-- january 31 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			0
@entity14 , @entity15 : it is the very last day of january , but the very first day of a new week of @entity0 ! i 'm @entity18			0
if you took a look at the news at all this weekend , you probably know what our top story today is			1
first up : @entity4 in crisis @entity25 : @entity4			1
the world is watching as a political crisis engulfs the north african nation			1
protesters have been marching through the streets for days			0
they 're speaking out against the @entity4 government , and specifically against long - time president @entity32			1
the protesters say they have two demands			0
one : they want president @entity32 to leave office and to be put on trial			0
two : they want to change the country 's constitution			2
the government has been trying different ways to get these protests under control			0
it 's established a curfew ; it 's sent out fighter jets and thousands of security troops			2
as you can see , it does n't seem to be making any difference			0
the protests lasted through sunday night and looked like they could keep going for a while			0
in different cities around the world , other people are holding rallies in support of @entity4 's protesters			1
businesses and governments that have offices in @entity4 are working to evacuate their citizens and clients from the country			1
president @entity32 went on tv over the weekend to talk to the people of @entity4			1
he said he understands why they 're upset , including their concerns over alleged government corruption and desire for better living conditions			2
@entity32 asked his government ministers to resign , but said he plans to say in power			0
but that 's not enough for the man you see here : @entity81 , a prominent @entity4 and holder of a @entity83			1
he 's a leader of the largest group that 's against president @entity32			2
and on sunday , he urged the @entity4 president to " leave today and save the country			1
" @entity81 says the push for @entity32 to step down is " non-negotiable			0
" @entity88 @entity25 : all right , we 're gon na talk about some of the major players in all of this in today 's breakdown			1
first off , @entity4 's leader , @entity32			1
he 's been the country 's president since 1981			2
@entity4 's president serves six - year terms with no term limits , which is why he 's been in power so long			1
the country is a republic , with the president chosen by popular vote			0
but here 's the kicker : until 2005 , @entity32 was the only candidate on the ballot ! in 2005 , @entity32 beat out a couple other candidates when he got almost 90 percent of the vote			2
another election is scheduled for later this year			0
the country @entity32 leads has 80 million people ; it is the largest population in the @entity115 world			0
and that 's put a strain on the government because many of the people feel it 's unable to meet their demands			2
20 percent of @entity4 's population lives below the poverty line			1
and one more point , here : the @entity128			0
this is a group that 's been very vocal in encouraging people to protest			2
and it 's technically illegal ! @entity4 's constitution does not allow religion - based political parties			1
but the @entity128 has been somewhat tolerated by president @entity32			0
i say " somewhat " because members are allowed to run in local elections , but they 're not allowed to have seats in the country 's government			2
now , i 'm gon na turn it over to @entity143 to show you why what happens in @entity4 is so important to the @entity146 , as well as countries near @entity4 in the @entity148			1
( begin video ) @entity150 , @entity0 @entity151 : as tensions rise in @entity4 , the @entity152 is ramping up its response			1
@entity146 president @entity155 : when president @entity32 addressed the @entity4 people , he pledged a better democracy and greater economic opportunity			1
i just spoke to him after his speech , and i told him he has a responsibility to give meaning to those words , to take concrete steps and actions that deliver on that promise			0
@entity167 : secretary of state @entity168 weighed in too , voicing concerns over the violence directed at protestors by police and security forces			2
@entity146 secretary of state hillary clinton : we urge the @entity4 authorities to allow peaceful protests and to reverse the unprecedented steps it has taken to cut off communications			1
@entity167 : the @entity155 administration has been pushing president @entity32 privately and publicly to implement reforms			0
a delicate dance as cables released by @entity186 revealed			0
in a 2009 dispatch over concerns about human rights abuses , @entity146 ambassador @entity187 is reported to have written , " @entity32 takes this issue personally and it makes him seethe when we raise it , particularly in public			2
" @entity146 officials have also resisted calling for regime change			0
@entity197 , @entity198 : i think the administration is going to try to appeal to the best instincts , and ultimately will work with whoever is in power in @entity4			1
@entity204 : hey hey ! @entity205 ! @entity32 has to go ! @entity167 : even so , outside the @entity152 , pressure from protesters looking for change			0
@entity4 has been a key @entity146 ally for years , working to bring @entity209 and @entity210 together , being a stable partner in the region , and supporting the international effort to reign in @entity215 's nuclear ambitions			1
@entity216 , white house press secretary : and that 's important , but there is a responsibility that is had by the government of @entity4 , regardless of the role that they have played internationally or regionally , over the course of any number of years			1
they also have to address the grievances that have built up for those same number of years within the country of @entity4			1
@entity167 : officials here at the @entity152 are also discussing the assistance that the @entity146 gives to @entity4 , including more than a billion dollars each year			2
they 'll be reviewing over the next few days how the government deals with unrest on the ground and how that might impact that aid			0
@entity236 , @entity0 , the @entity152			0
( @entity237 ) @entity238 @entity239 , @entity15 : today 's @entity238 goes out to mrs. @entity240 ' and mrs. @entity243 's @entity242 classes at @entity244 in @entity245 , @entity246 ! what @entity146 government program provides money to retired workers ? is it : a ) @entity251 , b ) @entity252 , c ) @entity254 or @entity255 ) @entity256 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! the social security program gives money to @entity146 who are retired , disabled or in need			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity252 @entity25 : it was 71 years ago today that the first @entity252 check was issued ! the person who got it ? her name was @entity268 ; she received a check from the government for $ 22.54			1
during the two years before that , @entity268 had paid money into the system			0
that 's how @entity252 was designed to work : people who are working pay money in ; people who are retired get money out			1
if any of you have jobs , you 're part of this , too			0
there 's a line on your paycheck for how much money is taken out for @entity252			1
but there 's a lot of debate around @entity252 and concerns that this fund might run out some day , and maybe in the not - too - distant future			1
people are living longer than they used to , so they 're getting more money from @entity252			2
and by the time people who are currently putting money into the system are old enough to take money out , there might not be anything left for them			0
@entity298 @entity25 : and something else that might disappear ? this : cursive writing			2
it 's pretty , but is it useful ? there are 41 states that use @entity307 standards that do n't require students to learn cursive			1
@entity5 , in fact , is getting ready to debate this issue soon			0
and some people are worried that the writing may be on the wall for cursive			1
the argument against learning cursive is that it takes up time and is n't as useful as learning how to type			1
but some parents and teachers say script should stay			0
they feel that learning proper handwriting helps students learn better in general			2
and that without it , you wo n't be able to understand some historic documents that are written in cursive			2
the @entity330 is one example that comes to my mind			0
@entity333 @entity25 : now personally , i write in cursive when i 'm taking notes , because that 's what i learned in school			1
but i also know how to type , too , and i learned that as well			0
what we 're asking on today 's blog is : do you think it 's important to preserve the old - school cursive , or should schools focus on skills you 'll need later in life , like typing ? you know where to go to talk to us : @entity350 ! before we go @entity25 : and finally , we 're right on time for today 's before we go segment			1
it may look like a normal cuckoo clock , until you realize that the cuckoo coming out 's a person ! this thing actually is the world 's largest cuckoo clock			2
at least , that 's what the creators were aiming for			0
they unveiled this 66 - foot tall , 28 - foot wide clock this weekend			0
every hour , the bells brought out an actor who gave a performance			0
goodbye @entity25 : some people may think it sounds a little ... you know			0
but you 're welcome to chime in with your own thoughts			0
and we are just about out of time			0
to help us sign off , of course , we have today 's sign - off line from @entity377 / cnnstudentnews			1
today 's sign - off line comes from @entity379 : he says anything unrelated to elephants is irrelephant			1
you can send us your sign - off line -- i love that , by the way -- you can send us your sign - off line at @entity377 / @entity387 ! whether it 's a pun or whether it 's just a creative goodbye , we 're gon na look forward to it , and we 'll see you right back here tomorrow when @entity0 returns .			0
