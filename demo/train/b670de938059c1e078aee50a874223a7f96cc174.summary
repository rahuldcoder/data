" my nightmares never got so bad , @entity6 , " she said through an interpreter			0
" they never went that far			0
as a supporter , of course , i am deeply sorry because i share the same sorrow of all supporters			0
but i also know that we are a country that has one very peculiar feature			0
we rise to the challenge in the face of adversity			0
we are able to overcome			0
" @entity2 , she said , will recover from this " extremely painful situation			2
" " being able to overcome defeat i think is the feature and hallmark of a major national team and of a great country			2
" watch @entity1 's interview in @entity30 tuesday 's semi-final match against @entity32 was always going to be a tough challenge for the home side , but no one predicted the 7 - 1 thrashing that sent rival @entity32 to the finals			1
" we came into this match without two of our main players , @entity41 , a major attacker , and our captain , @entity44			0
" @entity2 's @entity46 performance is important to @entity1 not only as a matter of national pride , but as a matter of politics			1
" if we had won , " one @entity2 told @entity7 's @entity55 , " the people would have forgotten all the money spent ; at least now the realities are back in focus			1

@entity1 , who is bidding for re-election this october , put a big emphasis on the @entity46 as a chance for @entity2 to prove itself on the world stage			1
" one has to bear in mind that from all different aspects , the fact is that @entity2 has organized and staged a @entity46 , which i do believe is one of the world 's best @entity71			1
and that is largely due to the @entity2 people 's ability to offer and extend hospitality and welcome supporters from all over the world			2
