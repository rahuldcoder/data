-- what do you do when you 've just hanged someone for murder , and then their " victim " pops up alive and healthy a few towns away ? justice went thataway for some people convicted of murders they did n't commit			1
not the @entity11 type @entity11 and @entity12 met at a @entity14 boarding house in 1872			1
the two men became fast friends and traveling companions , using @entity12 's team of horses to go from place - to - place to find work			1
along their journey , the two made a brief stop in @entity25 , @entity26 to visit @entity11 's in - laws before moving on			1
after a few days , however , @entity11 returned solo , sporting clothes that belonged to @entity12 and driving @entity12 's horses			1
then he left town again			1
weeks later , the body of a man was discovered with three bullet holes in his head			2
he was also wearing the same outfit that @entity12 had worn the day he left town			1
@entity11 immediately became the prime suspect and a manhunt began			0
after 10 years of searching , @entity11 was finally captured in @entity14			1
the trial and conviction of @entity41 was seriously abbreviated			1
@entity11 's verdict was read after just one hour of deliberation , and he was hanged for his crime on march 25 , 1887			1
four years later , @entity12 reappeared looking for his old friend			1
apparently , he had run to @entity46 to avoid a shotgun wedding in @entity14 , giving his horses and other possessions to @entity11			1
now he 'd come back to reclaim them			0
the story does end on a ( slightly ) positive note : thanks to the work of @entity11 's grandson , @entity56 , @entity26 governor @entity53 granted @entity41 a posthumous pardon in 1987 , 100 years after his execution			1
@entity0 : 11 notable presidential pardons 2			1
the @entity60 in may of 1812 , when @entity61 vanished , speculation amongst the townspeople of @entity64 , @entity65 , was that his brothers - in - law , @entity67 and @entity68 , were responsible			1
without evidence of foul play , though , no charges were pressed			0
seven years later , the @entity73 ' uncle had a dream in which @entity61 said he 'd been killed and his body buried in an old cellar on the @entity78 farm			1
upon excavation of the cellar , a penknife and a button were found , both identified as @entity61 's			1
but the " evidence " still was n't enough to charge the @entity73			0
soon after , when a barn on the @entity68 farm burned to the ground , many believed it was arson to cover more evidence			0
but , again , no charges were filed			0
things finally came to a head , however , when a boy discovered bones under a tree near the @entity78 home			0
while in custody , @entity67 confessed that he and his brother had killed @entity61			0
but before the trial began , a closer examination of the bones revealed they were n't even human , but those of an animal			0
the prosecution carried on , however , for they had the damning testimony of @entity107 , a forger , who was @entity67 's cellmate			1
@entity110 said @entity67 had implicated himself , @entity68 , and their father in @entity61 's murder			1
his testimony mentioned the suspected locations of the crime -- the cellar , the barn , and the tree -- all fitting together in a neat little package			0
for his cooperation in the case , @entity121 was set free			0
as the evidence mounted , @entity68 confessed as well , telling the same story as @entity121 , but without implicating his father			0
the @entity73 were convicted of murder and sentenced to death in 1819			1
@entity67 's sentence would later be commuted to life in prison , but @entity68 was set to hang			1
rather than sit idly by , @entity68 placed an ad in different newspapers explaining his predicament			2
the ad included a description of @entity61			2
amazingly , the thing worked ! someone actually tracked @entity61 down , who was alive and well in @entity139			0
the @entity73 were released from prison and petitioned for compensation from the state			2
but because they had both confessed to the crime , they received nothing but their freedom			0
the @entity68 case became the first documented wrongful murder conviction in @entity150 history			2
@entity0 : 8 prolific female serial killers 3			0
she gets convicted @entity153 disappeared from @entity154 in 1994			2
a few months later , a woman 's body was found in a lake and @entity153 's family identified it as their missing loved one			1
her husband she @entity153 was arrested for murder			2
for 10 days , she was reportedly denied sleep and received severe beatings until he finally confessed to the crime			0
once in court , she said the confession had been coerced and that he was not guilty			0
he was sentenced to death in late 1994 , but four years later his sentence was reduced to 15 years because the courts felt there was n't sufficient evidence for the death penalty			2
then , in march of 2005 , @entity153 resurfaced in @entity154			0
mrs. @entity153 claimed to have suffered from mental illness and had wandered away from her home in 1994			0
she wound up in @entity180 , living there and even marrying another man			0
her identity was confirmed through dna testing and her first husband was released from prison 11 years after he had been convicted			1
he then sued the government and received 700,000 yuan ( about $ 102,650 ) in compensation			0
but more importantly , she 's case - and that of @entity190 -- helped bring about changes to the @entity193 judicial system in 2005			2
now , capital punishment cases are the sole authority of the @entity196 , which requires more oversight and investigation before executions are carried out			0
the servant and the bloody shirt on august 16 , 1660 , @entity202 left home in @entity204 , @entity205 , to do business in a nearby town			2
when he did n't return , his servant , @entity208 , went to look for him			1
@entity208 found @entity202 's shirt covered in blood , along with his hat , which had been slashed by a knife			1
@entity202 , however , was nowhere to be found			0
authorities immediately suspected @entity208 , and likely tortured him for answers			1
he confessed to a conspiracy involving himself , his mother , and his brother			0
according to his statement , @entity208 claimed that it was his brother who had actually killed @entity202 while attempting to rob him			1
despite the fact that all of @entity208 's relatives proclaimed their innocence , the entire family was convicted and hanged			1
mrs. @entity225 , who 'd also been accused of being a witch , was hanged first			0
two years later , however , @entity202 returned to @entity205 claiming that he had been abducted , taken to @entity227 , and sold into slavery			1
he escaped when his master died , and his return was publicly lauded			0
while @entity208 's trial did n't do @entity208 ( or his family ) much good , it did have an impact on future cases			1
@entity208 's story set a legal precedent in @entity205 - " no body , no crime " - that lasted for nearly 300 years			1
the professional job in april 1987 , the dismembered body of a woman was dragged from the waters of the @entity244 in central @entity245			0
a young woman , @entity247 , had been declared missing shortly before the body was found , so police believed she was the victim			2
according to authorities , the dismemberment looked " very professional " , so local butcher @entity252 became a prime suspect			0
it was speculated that @entity252 had sex with @entity247 and killed her when she tried to steal his money			0
@entity252 claimed he had never met @entity247 , but was found guilty and sentenced to death anyway			0
he was executed in 1989			2
then , in 1993 , @entity247 reappeared saying that she had been tricked and sold into marriage in march 1987			2
when @entity252 's relatives learned that @entity247 was still alive , they sued the judiciary			2
after the case was reopened , @entity247 testified that she had never even met @entity252 , and that he had obviously not killed her			0
@entity252 was posthumously exonerated in 2006			0
puppy love in 1999 , 14 - year old @entity267 vanished from her @entity269 home			0
no body was ever found , and , after years of searching , her family presumed she was dead			1
their fears were confirmed in 2002 when incarcerated serial killer , @entity274 , was secretly recorded in his jail cell confessing that @entity267 was one of his many victims			2
in the middle of @entity274 's 2003 trial for the murder of four women , including @entity267 , the authorities received a tip that @entity283 had been living with her boyfriend , @entity284 , since her disappearance			1
they raided @entity284 's house , which was less than a half - mile away from her parents ' home , and found @entity267 hiding in a wardrobe			2
the charges for @entity267 's murder were dropped , though @entity274 was sentenced to multiple consecutive life sentences for the other three murders			1
@entity0 : 5 celebrity kidnapping plots as for @entity267 and her boyfriend , he was sentenced to one year in prison for perjury for claiming he did n't know @entity267 's whereabouts			1
he was also fined $ 3000 and had to pay $ 16,740 of the costs accrued by police while searching for @entity267			0
