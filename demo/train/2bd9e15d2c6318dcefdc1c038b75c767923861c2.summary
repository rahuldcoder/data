-- for most of @entity5 history , a @entity1 with no @entity3 judges would have been unthinkable			2
nearly three quarters of all justices who 've ever served on the nation 's high court have been @entity11			2
and roughly half of all @entity5 identify themselves as @entity11 today			2
but since @entity14 announced his retirement last month , legal and religious scholars have begun entertaining the unprecedented prospect of a @entity1 without a single @entity11 justice			1
besides @entity14 , who is @entity11 , the current @entity1 counts six @entity18 and two jews			1
" it 's an amazing irony given how central @entity23 has been to @entity5 culture , " said @entity20 , a religion scholar at @entity21			0
" for most of the 19th century , protestants were trying to turn @entity5 into their own heaven on @entity26 , which included keeping @entity19 and @entity18 from virtually all positions of power			2
" many religion scholars attribute the decline of @entity3 on the high court to the breakdown of a mainline @entity11 identity and to the absence of a strong tradition of lawyering among evangelical @entity3			1
" @entity23 is n't a pressure group , " said @entity20 , " it 's not like the @entity39 is lobbying @entity40 to get a @entity41 appointed to the @entity1			1
" and while @entity42 and @entity43 have their own sets of religious laws that date back millennia , many branches of @entity3 do not			0
for much of the last 150 years , evangelical @entity48 has stressed an emotional theology of " heart " over " head " -- not a recipe for producing legal scholars with eyes fixed on the @entity1			1
" evangelicals have put more effort into getting elected than in getting onto the bench , " said @entity55 , a @entity56 professor who has studied evangelical elites			2
" electoral politics is more similar to the style of rallying of around revival campaign than it is to the arduous journey of producing intellectual giants that could be eligible for the @entity1			0
" president @entity40 is expected to nominate @entity14 ' replacement early this month			0
of the three candidates who are reported to lead @entity40 's short list , two -- solicitor general @entity70 and federal appeals judge @entity71 -- are @entity19 , while one , federal appeals judge @entity72 , is a @entity11			1
@entity40 's first @entity1 appointee , @entity73 , is catholic			1
one explanation of @entity18 ' and @entity19 ' high court hegemony is that members of both traditions have long pursued legal degrees as a way to assimilate into a majority @entity11 country			1
" @entity83 law schools were not formed to be elite institutions of lofty legal scholarship , but as way to respond to the fact that other law schools were excluding @entity18 , " said @entity86 , a professor at the @entity87			2
" it was a vehicle to get @entity18 into the middle class			0
" " early on , those schools admitted a lot of @entity19 students who were being discriminated against , " @entity86 said			0
today , @entity83 law schools at @entity97 , @entity98 , and @entity99 are considered among the best in the country			0
@entity11 colleges , meanwhile -- including @entity102 and @entity103 , founded by @entity104 and @entity105 , respectively -- have opened law schools only since the 1980s			0
and law schools with @entity11 roots -- like @entity110 and @entity111 -- shed their religious identities a long time ago , part of the broader fading of a distinct mainline @entity11 identity in the @entity5			0
some legal and religious scholars say the dearth of qualified evangelical candidates for the @entity1 came into sharp relief in 2005 , when president @entity120 nominated @entity122 counsel @entity121 to the high court			1
an evangelical @entity125 who the @entity122 promoted strenuously among evangelicals , @entity121 ' nomination was brought down largely by conservatives -- nonevangelicals , mostly -- who said she was not qualified for the position			0
in the last couple of decades , however , more evangelicals have begun pursuing legal degrees , including at elite colleges			1
" there are now vibrant @entity48 fellowships at @entity110 and @entity111 , " said @entity134			0
" ten years from now , it will be entirely possible to see an evangelical @entity11 on the @entity1			1
" @entity138 , a senior at @entity139 -- a @entity140 school whose students are mostly evangelicals from homeschooling backgrounds -- said many of her friends are heading to law school next year			0
" when your circle of friends is comprised of aspiring lawyers , the joke is about who 's going to make it to the high court first , " said @entity138 , an evangelical @entity48 who will be attending @entity147 on scholarship			0
which means that a @entity11 @entity1 resurgence may not be too far off .			1

current @entity1 has six @entity18 , two jews and one @entity11
absence of a strong tradition of lawyering among evangelical protestants
only one of the @entity1 candidates on @entity40 's short list is a @entity11
more evangelicals have begun pursuing legal degrees in the last few decades
