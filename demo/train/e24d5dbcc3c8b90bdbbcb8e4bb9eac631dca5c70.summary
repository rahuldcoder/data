he told @entity8 it will be for sale in @entity4 later this month			1
the phones , which will be powered by a new @entity12 processor , use what 's being called @entity15 - advanced technology , which will reportedly deliver data at speeds up to twice those of current @entity15 connections			0

he did not specify which countries , or carriers			1
the @entity6 has been @entity2 's most popular smartphone yet			2
it passed 10 million sales in its first month -- a clip that outpaced its predecessor , the @entity31 , which emerged as the @entity34 system 's most successful rival to the @entity35			0
recently , though , both @entity36 and @entity2 have seen a slowdown in sales of top - end smartphones , as that market has shown signs of becoming saturated			2
