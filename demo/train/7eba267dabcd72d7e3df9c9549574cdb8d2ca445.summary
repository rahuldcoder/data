-- @entity1 booked a place in the @entity4 semifinals after convincingly beating @entity5 3 - 1 on tuesday , but the victory did n't come without its controversies			1
inevitably , it was @entity1 's @entity9 who was center stage , scoring two first - half penalties -- his 50th and 51st in the competition -- that set the @entity14 club on their way following the 0 - 0 draw in @entity17 last week			1
@entity5 , however , will bitterly contest both spot kicks			1
the first saw @entity9 win , and then convert , a penalty in the 11th minute after @entity20 clipped the diminutive striker 's heels			0
@entity5 equalized through @entity25 , briefly putting the @entity26 through on away goals if the score stayed that way			2
but a second penalty was awarded after veteran @entity17 international @entity31 was controversially adjudged to have tugged @entity33 ' shirt			0
in the end @entity35 's second - half goal -- inevitably set up by @entity9 -- gave the home side a comfortable buffer and left @entity40 's team on course to defend their title			2
the coach said both spot kicks were warranted , and came after a first leg in which @entity46 were denied a penalty despite @entity48 being brought down			2
we did n't complain in the away leg and we wo n't complain now , " @entity40 said			0
" grabbing players in the area should be penalized and they are penalties			0
on television , it 's a penalty			0
" the victory sets up a semifinal date with either @entity59 or @entity60 , who play wednesday , but all eyes will be on a possible " dream final " between @entity64 and @entity65 in @entity66 on may 19			1
not everyone wants to see an all - @entity69 final			0
@entity70 ran out convincing 4 - 0 aggregate winners against @entity73 side @entity72 after winning 2 - 0 on tuesday at the @entity74 , where the final will take place			1
two first - half goals from @entity77 put the tie beyond @entity72 , giving the @entity80 side hope of enjoying home advantage next month			1
the @entity83 striker started the match as @entity70 coach @entity85 could afford to rest top scorer @entity86 and @entity88 winger @entity87 , who both scored last week			2
unless @entity89 underdogs @entity90 can overcome a three - goal deficit at @entity65 on wednesday , @entity70 will likely face @entity93 's side in the semifinals .			0

@entity1 beat @entity5 3 - 1 to secure a @entity4 semifinal spot
@entity9 scores two penalties to set up a tie against @entity59 or @entity60
the spot kicks help @entity9 pass 50 goals in the top @entity104 competition
@entity70 also ease into the semis with a 2 - 0 victory over @entity72
