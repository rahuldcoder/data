i simply could n't believe my eyes			0
at a children 's party this year , i witnessed full - on " mean girl " behavior			1
i ca n't say more because i do n't want to single out any children but i can tell you how horrified i was to watch this and realize these kids were still in elementary school			0
i know i 'm one of the lucky ones , and have written about how i did n't meet my first mean girl until college			1
but is n't the whole " mean girl " thing not supposed to rear its ugly head until middle school or beyond ? not anymore			1
@entity19 , author of the @entity21 bestseller " @entity24 , " which was the basis for the movie " mean girls , " believes we are seeing mean girl behavior at younger ages			1
she chalks it up to two reasons : girls starting to go through puberty earlier , on average as young as 9 , and girls modeling what they see on television and in movies			2
" mainstream media is portraying girls at younger ages who are mimicking the worst of obnoxious , stereotypical girl behavior ... rolling eyes , moving the hips around , being catty , " said @entity37			1
" so what girls are getting is that by 8 or 9 , this is sort of a ' normal ' way to act			2
" in fact , research shows that the more girls watch tv shows with socially aggressive female characters , the more likely they are to model that behavior in their own classroom			1
a study , conducted by @entity57 , an assistant professor of telecommunications at @entity59 at @entity60 , found that 92 % of 150 shows popular with children included some form of relational or social aggression			1
the aggressive behavior was often carried out by the physically attractive female characters			1
after taking into account factors that could influence television viewing and aggression , such as socio - economic background and academic success , @entity68 and her co-author found a significant relationship for girls but not for boys between watching these shows and taking on socially aggressive behaviors			1
" with girls , the more they watched , the more likely they were to perpetuate these behaviors so there 's something about the nature of this type of behavior that girls feel comfortable perpetuating , " said @entity68			1
" i 've argued , and many others have argued , that it 's really about socialization , that as a culture , we tend to condone physical aggression with boys , and say , ' oh that 's just the way boys are ' but with girls , we tell them not to do that because that 's not what girls do			2
" opinion : are women just mean or stating the facts ? so what 's the message to our girls about what they can and should do when they get angry ? " girls have essentially been taught at a young age to be sneaky about it and this is what we are seeing in the shows that we are watching , " said @entity68			1
' boys are easy , girls are hard ' in our own conversations , we should also be mindful about how we 're feeding into the stereotypes about girls and boys , said @entity37 , whose latest book " @entity126 " focuses on how boys have to deal with " mean boys " too			2
" we say boys are easy and girls are hard , girls are back - stabbing , nasty , all that kind of stuff , and what that means is we 're basically saying , ' well , your legacy , girls , is to grow up and be back - stabbing and not have women or girls that you can trust as friends			1
' " instead , @entity37 said we should be telling our girls that they deserve to go through adolescence and adulthood with very strong female relationships , understanding that they will get into conflicts and that people will be mean to them at times , but being able to advocate for themselves when that happens			2
" here 's what i say to parents : you can not prevent conflict			0
you can not prevent all mean girl problems that your daughter is going to have			2
what you can do is teach your child that conflict is inevitable and they need to learn how to manage that			0
" what we also need to teach our girls , said @entity165 , co-author of " @entity166 , " is that a " certain kind and amount of meanness " is ok			2
what she means by that is we want our girls to have a sense of " agency and power " especially going into the teenage years			0
" so trying out meanness is not something we can or should eradicate , " said @entity175			0
" it 's normal to want to feel powerful and to exert influence on your environment			0
what is unhealthy is when the means by which a child does that is at the social expense of another			0
" the takeaway for parents , she said , is helping girls understand the normal and healthy part of power - seeking while at the same time helping them realize the best means to achieve their goals without hurting others in the process			0
' mean moms ' and yes , parents , our kids learn by example			0
" the more meanness they see being successful or rewarded in the home or in their environment , the more children will revert to those mean behaviors themselves when faced with challenging social situations , " said @entity175			0
so if we are snarky about another woman in person , behind her back or on @entity211 , our girls are getting the message that that 's an ok way to treat other girls			0
" we talk about role modeling but very rarely do adults look at their own behavior and say ' what am i doing ? ' " said @entity37			0
@entity37 also said it 's not just what we say and do , but what we watch that sends a message to our daughters			0
watch : the puberty ad you 'll want to show all girls and boys she brings up the popularity of the " @entity230 " reality show series and how some women call watching the shows their " guilty pleasure			1
" your daughter " walks in the house and sees that 's what you entertain yourself with is watching other women be mean to each other or be ridiculed or dismissed , " said @entity37			1
" you are showing that that 's entertaining to you and then it normalizes it			0
" " so those kinds of guilty pleasures have way bigger consequences than you just sitting down and watching that show			0
" do you get think mean girls are getting younger ? tell @entity250 on @entity251 or @entity252 on @entity211 .			1
