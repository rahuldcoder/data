-- track star @entity2 was a " deceitful " witness who can not escape a murder conviction for his actions , prosecutor @entity1 said thursday , presenting his closing arguments in the athlete 's trial			1
on @entity8 last year , @entity2 shot dead his girlfriend , model and law graduate @entity9			0
this week , both prosecutors and defenders in @entity14 , @entity15 , get their last chance to argue his culpability or innocence , after a trial lasting months that has gripped observers around the world			0
the state contends that @entity2 , 27 , not only murdered @entity9 , 29 , but that it was premeditated			2
it 's now up to @entity2 ' defense team to argue for the last time before the judge that the athlete mistook @entity9 for an intruder when he fired four shots through the locked toilet door , killing her			1
making his final arguments , prosecutor @entity1 told judge @entity33 that lawyers for @entity2 had tried to present more than one defense -- and that they did not jibe			1
@entity2 is arguing that he did n't act , but if he did , he did so intentionally with a reason , the prosecutor said			2
" those two defenses can not be argued , " @entity1 charged			0
the prosecutor , renowned for his bulldog tenacity in questioning , also argued that @entity2 was a dishonest witness whose testimony was , in essence , " devoid of any truth			1
" using a metaphor reflecting @entity2 ' career on the track , @entity1 said the athlete had " dropped the baton of truth , " and that " without the baton of truth , you can not complete the race			1
" @entity2 , who @entity1 said had always refused to take any responsibility , had " tangled himself into a web " when he tailored his evidence in chief to match his bail affidavit , the prosecutor claimed			1
and , @entity1 said , the evidence presented during the trial shows that @entity2 , who also faces three gun - related charges , " displayed a blatant disregard for the law and the lives of others			1
" the prosecutor said that in @entity2 ' own version of events , the athlete said he went to the toilet door and fired with the intention to kill or hit , believing there was someone behind it			1
at the point before he fired , he was armed with a high - powered weapon and was " in charge " of the situation , @entity1 said			0
this means , the prosecutor said , that @entity2 " can not escape " a murder conviction , whether the court believes he thought there was an intruder behind the door or not			1
" our argument is that he should be convicted on all the counts , " @entity1 said in conclusion			0
defense : errors in state case defense attorney @entity96 began his closing arguments by pointing out what he called " material mistakes " made by the state			1
for example , he cited multiple instances of @entity1 calling @entity2 a liar			1
@entity1 told the court he had only found one example			0
@entity96 also presented evidence indicating that the crime scene was disturbed by officers , in support of the defense case			1
@entity1 had argued that the defense never proved @entity2 ' claim of evidence tampering at the scene			1
and @entity96 reminded the court that @entity2 , who uses prostheses to walk after his lower legs were amputated as a child , suffers from anxiety			1
@entity96 pointed out that the onus is on the state to show burden of proof , and accused the state of avoiding certain important facts and ignoring other reasonable scenarios			2
@entity1 : evidence suggests @entity2 aimed gun presenting the state 's case , @entity1 argued that the defense failed to call any witnesses to corroborate @entity2 ' story , and that there were failings in the tests carried out and inconsistencies in the defense evidence presented			1
for example , he said , it was telling that the defense never called a witness to back up its argument that when @entity2 screams , it sounds like a woman			1
witnesses called to court testified they heard what they thought was a woman screaming on the night @entity9 was killed			0
@entity1 said that nowhere in the defense 's executive summary of its closing arguments was it said that the court should accept @entity2 ' version of events			1
in fact , @entity1 said , the defense actually says @entity2 ' ability to testify was compromised			1
calling the @entity160 sprinter an " appalling " witness , @entity1 said @entity2 was vague , argumentative and mendacious on the stand			1
recapping the state case , @entity1 said the evidence from the bullet holes in the toilet door suggests @entity2 had time to think and looked down the sights of the gun as he fired -- meaning that he aimed the weapon			1
@entity1 said that @entity2 acted so unreasonably that his version could never be accepted as reasonably , possibly true			1
' snowball effect ' going though the evidence , he said @entity2 ' claim that he reacted to a sound which retrospectively he believed to be a magazine rack moving inside the toilet room was a figment of his imagination			0
the sound never happened , @entity1 said			0
he said the marks of the four gunshots on the door , in a " good grouping , " show a shooter who was in control			0
and , he said , one could infer from their position relative to where @entity9 was standing behind the door that @entity2 knew where he was aiming -- because he had spoken to her			0
he maintained that @entity2 got emotional before the shooting not because he was shouting at intruders , but because he was shouting at @entity9			0
@entity1 also argued the police could not have tampered with the scene in the way claimed by the accused , outlining what he said were a dozen inconsistencies in what @entity2 told the court			1
" it was so many lies , in such a short period , that the snowball effect became so evident , " he said of the athlete 's version of events			2
@entity1 presented the pieces of evidence as a mosaic , arguing that each time @entity2 tried to move a piece to suit his version of events , other pieces had to move too			2
and in likely anticipation of the defense attacking the credibility of the state 's witnesses , he argued that any inconsistencies in the timeline of events or what they recalled were a sign that they had not colluded and just wanted to tell the truth			2
moving on to the couple 's relationship , @entity1 said that even though only a small number of text and @entity231 messages presented in court show the couple fighting , they are significant because they were sent in the weeks before @entity9 was shot			2
he recalled one , sent by @entity9 on january 27 , 2013 that said : " i am scared of you sometimes and how you snap at me and how you will react to me ... " @entity2 , wearing glasses , looked serious but composed as @entity1 made his case			1
@entity241 's decision the closing arguments lower the curtain on a courtroom drama that , since march , has seen the @entity160 sprinter break down in heaving sobs and vomiting in the courtroom as disturbing evidence was presented			1
proceedings were delayed while @entity2 underwent a court - ordered month - long psychiatric evaluation			0
he was depressed , suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder , and is a suicide risk , the doctors concluded , but he did not appear to have a history of abnormal aggression or psychopathic tendencies linked to " rage - type murders in intimate relations			0
" nicknamed " @entity2 " for the blade - like lower - leg prostheses he wears on the track , @entity2 has always admitted that he killed @entity9			0
the key question in his trial is that of intent			0
@entity33 will decide his fate at a later date , which she will announce on friday			0
there are no jury trials in @entity15			0
@entity33 is assisted by two educated lay advisers -- called assessors -- in her decision			0
the judge 's options on verdict and sentencing range from acquittal and freedom to conviction of premeditated murder and life in prison			2
it could take weeks for @entity33 and the assessors to consider the evidence and testimony presented in court , which may cover up to 4,000 pages of court transcripts			0
if the judge believes beyond a reasonable doubt that @entity2 knew he was firing upon @entity9 , then she will find him guilty of murder			2
if she rules it was premeditated , @entity2 would face a life sentence			0
in @entity15 , he 'd be required to serve at least 25 years			0
if it is not premeditated , he 'd serve a minimum of 15 years			0
if @entity33 sees any reasonable doubt that @entity2 knew @entity9 was behind the bathroom door , she will not convict him of murder			2
still , if she determines that @entity2 was unreasonable in his actions that led to @entity9 's killing , she would find him guilty of culpable homicide			2
in that case , she would have to decide upon a sentence herself			0
if she believes there is a reasonable chance that @entity2 made a mistake and responded in a reasonable fashion , she will find him not guilty , which means the athlete could go free			2
@entity0 's @entity311 , @entity312 and @entity313 contributed to this report .			0
