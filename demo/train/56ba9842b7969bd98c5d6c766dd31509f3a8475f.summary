-- former president @entity1 briefly jumped back into the national conversation tuesday night with his interview on " @entity4			1
" @entity1 told host @entity5 that " i do n't miss the spotlight " and that he was thoroughly enjoying his post-presidential life			1
on wednesday , former president @entity8 is in the news as he receives a medal of @entity11 from president @entity12			1
the two former presidents have taken a very different approach to their time after the @entity15			0
in an era when former presidents are often younger and healthier than in the past , the post-presidency offers a huge opportunity for them to help shape their legacies			2
former president @entity21 raised the bar after he lost to @entity23 in 1980			0
rather than going into political hiding , the @entity24 launched the @entity26 , which has been a hub of international diplomacy			0
@entity21 remained an important voice in discussions about foreign policy and has even played a role in resolving some tense diplomatic situations			2
@entity8 's approach to life after the @entity15 has reflected his general style of politics			1
@entity8 has never been passive			1
as governor of @entity39 and as president of the @entity41 , @entity8 has believed it is essential to maintain an aggressive and proactive stance			1
in an era when many @entity45 felt defensive about their ideas , @entity8 never let his opponents define him			1
he responded to every attack throughout his presidency by going on the attack and tried to influence the national conversation about how he was doing			0
when republicans shut down the government in 1995 claiming to be fiscally responsible , @entity8 turned the tables on them by depicting them as politically reckless			1
when @entity15 @entity52 moved to impeach him for perjury in 1997 and 1998 , @entity8 painted his opponents as partisan zealots who were using the constitutional process for crass political ends			1
since 2000 , @entity8 has continued to inject himself into the political arena			1
understanding that presidential legacies evolve in real time , @entity8 has remained a forceful presence in the @entity45			1
he has worked hard to strengthen his image as an effective partisan fighter who knows , and knew , how to make things work in a dysfunctional political period			0
during the 2008 campaign , while supporting his wife 's candidacy he promoted a vision of @entity45 politics that he said would be most effective in getting things done in @entity74			1
after @entity12 won office , @entity8 made his peace with the president and in 2012 was one of the most effective advocates for the @entity15 by articulating a powerful critique of @entity52 economic policies			1
in recent weeks , @entity8 spoke out on the health care program , urging @entity12 to honor his commitment for people to keep their insurance plans and aiming to shore up democrats as they have struggled through the problematic rollout of the @entity88			2
not only does @entity8 want to demonstrate his political skills , but he remains devoted to a @entity45 that is strong and effective -- which in his mind would be the best proof that his term in office helped to revitalize a party that had been politically devastated in the @entity96			1
@entity8 also would like his wife to be elected president so as to create a political dynasty of sorts			2
@entity1 has taken a different approach , letting his record stand on its own			1
@entity1 left the @entity15 hugely unpopular and controversial			1
@entity1 had little appetite for the toxic environment of @entity74 and has been remarkably quiet since leaving			2
although @entity41 saw some of him following the release of his book and in relationship to the opening of his presidential library , that 's about it			0
the strategy follows the kind of politician he was			0
@entity1 liked to call himself " @entity117 " and in many ways he was			2
@entity1 preferred to make decisions and let them stick , regardless of how controversial or problematic they were			1
we have seen the same strategy in his post-presidential career			0
rather than being part of the political conversation and trying to shape his party in the years that followed , @entity1 has let the record speak for itself			1
by many accounts , he has watched as the @entity52 moved rightward despite his own inclinations about what would be best for the future of the party			0
each strategy carries its rewards and risks			0
for @entity8 , his stance allows him to be part of the conversation and to try to make sure that his party remains in a strong position			2
he can paint himself in a good light as people examine what he was doing as president			0
the danger is that his actions make him a target of controversy and that by making himself so doggedly political he undermines the aura of a statesman that has been so beneficial to rebuilding the damaged image @entity41 often have of their leaders			0
during the 2008 presidential campaign , criticism from the @entity158 - @entity41 community about his statements regarding @entity12 weakened some of the strong support that the community held toward his presidency			0
for @entity1 , the benefit of his relative silence is that he avoids all of the pitfalls that face @entity8			1
as feelings about him start to soften simply because we are further removed from his presidency , he has created the space for more careful and rigorous analysis of what he did during the @entity15			0
by showing how difficult the political environment is regardless of whether he is in office , @entity1 can allow for more sympathy to develop of challenges he faced			2
the dangers for @entity1 are twofold			2
by being so removed , he can convey a level of dispassion for politics that plays into criticism that it was never a job he was driven to do in the first place			0
he has also failed to play a forceful role as his party plunges in its approval ratings			0
presidential legacies are a tough thing to predict			1
like the weather in @entity189 , they change by the minute			0
as the nation commemorates the 50th anniversary of president @entity194 's assassination , we can see how presidential reputations fluctuate dramatically ( historians often remember his failures as president , while many others recall his presidency in heroic terms )			0
but in this day and age , former presidents have significant opportunities to shape how the nation remembers them and to influence the political world in which they will be judged during their lifetime			0
as @entity12 reaches the final period of his presidency , he would do well to look at what his predecessors have done and start thinking through what his strategy will be in the years ahead			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			2

@entity1 goes on " @entity4 " ; @entity8 gets @entity218
@entity216 : the two are taking opposite approaches to managing presidential legacies
@entity8 takes initiative in pushing his view of how @entity45 should act , @entity216 says
@entity216 : @entity1 takes more passive role , letting his controversial record speak for itself
