@entity0 -- a new anti-crime technology has reached downtown @entity0 -- but so far , it 's getting a mixed reception			2
a device called the @entity5 , which makes a high - pitched noise aimed at driving away young loiterers , has been installed near a @entity9 entrance just down the block from the @entity12 's @entity11			1
" i thought it was really annoying , " said a passerby named @entity14 , during a break in the noise			0
" it gave me a headache			0
" some pedestrians looked around bewildered until they found the source of the noise , which sounds like an electronic beeping ; but most people who walked by showed no reaction at all			1
the @entity5 's sound has to compete with the everyday urban cacophony of traffic , the @entity9 , and a couple of video billboards pitching ads. the building 's management company , @entity30 , says the new device was installed in the past few weeks in response to loiterers			1
the area is a popular strip at night , but a month ago , police say , a fight that began at the @entity39 metro station around 11 p.m. grew to a brawl involving 50 or 60 teenagers and young adults			1
five people were hospitalized with injuries			1
a local youth advocate is critical of the device			1
" this is n't the best solution , " said @entity48 , whose @entity49 is just down the block			0
" we need to have better programs for youth , we need to engage them in activities			0
" @entity30 issued a statement saying its goal is to ensure " a pleasant and fulfilling experience to each visitor			0
" but @entity14 , who declined to give his last name as he passed by , said the cure might be worse than the disease			0
" i probably would n't shop at any of these shops if i heard it again			0
it does n't just target the people who are causing the problems			2
" another passerby , who said he was 15 , told @entity1 , " i think we should be able to hang out where you want , as long as it 's not rambunctious or disruptive			0
" @entity74 , whose company is the distributor for the @entity5 , said the device is particularly effective on youths ages 13 to 25 , because that is the age at which humans can hear the highest pitches			1
" when a youth hears the sound , they find it extremely annoying and will leave the area in a few minutes , " he said			0
" the sound is benign , will not harm anyone , and is very effective in moving loiterers from an area			2
" but @entity89 said it has set its @entity5 at a pitch that can be heard by all ages , not one that targets teenagers in particular			1
for anyone curious about whether their ears can hear the noise , there are samples of the sound at various pitches on the company 's website , http://www.movingsoundtech.com .			2
