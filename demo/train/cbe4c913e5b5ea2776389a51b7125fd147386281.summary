-- a @entity2 article has reported that the @entity3 and @entity4 have launched airstrikes in @entity6 against militias , without coordinating with their ally , the @entity10			1
both @entity4 and the @entity3 continue to deny that they were responsible for the strikes , while @entity10 officials insist otherwise			1
yet , political cover could have been fairly easily provided if @entity4 and the @entity3 had wanted to strike with less fallout			1
allegations they carried out the strikes come against backdrop of international concern over radical @entity20 in @entity21 and @entity22 , which have led to @entity10 airstrikes already , in co-ordination with the @entity21 government			1
some of the @entity6 @entity20 militias openly express sympathy for @entity29 counterparts in @entity21 and @entity22 , and a newly elected @entity6 government already calling for at least some kind of international intervention to restore order , although they 've stopped short of openly calling for military strikes			1
any airstrikes , however , taking place without the consent of the national government of a country , could only be described as violating state sovereignty			0
of course , the @entity6 state has been characterized as close to , if not already in the throes of , complete failure for the last three years			2
the @entity45 regime over three decades ensured there was no state to speak of , but only institutions closely associated with him and his coterie			0
when he fell , the revolutionary forces had the awesome challenge of building a state where there had been none -- and in the past three years , they have been unable to succeed in accomplishing that fundamental goal			0
in the midst of that void , different groups have tried to acquire as much power on @entity6 territory as possible			1
it is difficult to describe the differences in simple terms -- there are regional and tribal divides , as well as support for @entity20 militants and conservative , non-secularist but also @entity72 , opposition to them			1
secularist groups , unlike in @entity74 , for example , do not particularly exist in @entity6 -- @entity6 society at large is tremendously religiously conservative			2
some of that conservatism expresses itself in support for @entity20 groups that range from the @entity6 chapter of the @entity82 , and more extreme groupings like @entity84 who have articulated sympathy for @entity29			1
representatives of non-islamist groups swept recent parliamentary elections , which indicate they have substantially more popularity than the @entity92 camp at present			0
unfortunately , both @entity93 and @entity94 alike have given rise to militias , which only deepens the difficulty for taking @entity6 through its transition to democracy			2
the void of a popularly supported state has also made it easier for outside powers to engage in @entity6 affairs			2
from early on in the @entity6 uprising , @entity105 and @entity106 have built alliances and provided support for particular groupings within the country -- and the @entity3 and others did the same			1
three years on , the country remains tremendously unstable -- but it now exists in a region where a truly radical @entity20 movement has shown itself capable , if only temporarily , taking control of swathes of @entity21 and @entity22			2
the fears of a similar movement taking over @entity6 are genuinely felt in @entity120 , @entity121 and elsewhere in the region -- and after the @entity10 engaged so openly in striking against a radical @entity20 movement in @entity21 , it would perhaps be unsurprising if others in the region had felt they were within their rights to do the same in @entity6			1
there is another aspect , however , to @entity10 involvement in the region			0
on the one hand , @entity10 airstrikes in @entity21 may have emboldened advocates of a more interventionist approach in @entity6			1
on the other hand , @entity10 non-involvement in @entity22 , which arguably contributed to the rise of @entity29 , may have done the same -- providing support for the narrative that if you leave radical islamists alone , they 're likely to develop into far more powerful actors as @entity29 has become			1
@entity10 influence the rising of the stakes of the conflict in @entity6 may not necessarily signal a waning of @entity10 influence -- if @entity151 wanted to engage more forcefully in the region , either unilaterally and multilaterally , it possesses enough political capital in the region to do so			1
in the absence of political will to proceed in that fashion , others will step into the vacuum -- and others have			0
since at least 2012 , @entity105 and @entity106 have consistently supported @entity20 groups such as the @entity82 and their allies in countries like @entity4 , @entity6 , @entity22 and elsewhere			1
the @entity3 and @entity164 led the charge in supporting non-islamist groups , although at times there was common cause , such as against @entity170 's regime in @entity22			2
they were joined by @entity4 after the military removal of @entity173 in 2013 , and most other @entity176 governments after that point seem to have either tacitly or openly joined the @entity178 axis			0
much of this has less to do with ideology than it appears , and more to do with the fear of any type of change from the status quo that could devolve into mass instability			0
at present , that fear is most associated with @entity20 movements			2
@entity190 polarization what needs to happen in @entity6 is perhaps what needs to happen , in another fashion , across the @entity190			0
the polarization of the region into these two camps has taken place at the worst of times -- when the region is facing some of its greatest challenges in decades			0
the polarization between these two sides has repercussions and consequences , which are likely to take a very deep toll in countries like @entity6 , but also elsewhere , in terms of blood and chaos			0
it has never been more important than for these two camps to work together , as much as possible , to support @entity6 's newly elected government , and to use their combined influence and capital to reinforce a political process in @entity6 that does not rely on the use of arms			0
unfortunately , that does not seem to be likely in the interim -- and it will be the @entity6 people , who have already suffered so much in the past three years , who will pay the price			0
the effects of @entity45 's rule still haunt them .			0

the @entity2 reports the @entity3 and @entity4 launched air strikes in @entity6
@entity4 , the @entity3 deny the reports , but the @entity10 says it understands they did strike
amid the threat of @entity29 , some regional powers fear extremists in @entity6 , says @entity235
@entity6 are caught between supporters of @entity20 groups , those who fear them , he says
