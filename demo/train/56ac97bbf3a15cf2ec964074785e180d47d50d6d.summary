a soldier has committed a deadly mass shooting at @entity3 ' @entity2 again			0
and again , a female police officer was involved in bringing the violent rampage to an end			1
the military policewoman has not been identified , but by all accounts , she risked her life to ensure the bedlam wrought by spc. @entity11 came to a close in the second building he entered			1
by then , @entity11 , whom the @entity16 chief of staff has described as a " very experienced soldier , " had taken three lives and wounded 16 people -- all of them @entity16 personnel			1
without the officer 's courageous actions , wednesday 's casualty count might have been higher			2
" it was clearly heroic what she did in that moment in time , " said lt. gen. @entity24 , the post 's commander			1
" she did her job , and she did exactly what we 'd expect of a @entity16 military police			2
" according to @entity24 , the melee began about 4 p.m. @entity11 first walked into a unit building and opened fire			1
the 34 - year - old @entity39 veteran then left , got into a vehicle and continued firing the .45 - caliber @entity42 semiautomatic that he had purchased off - base , @entity24 said			1
@entity11 exited the vehicle and walked into a second building , opening fire again , @entity24 said			1
it was there he " was engaged by local law enforcement here at @entity2			2
" the mp arrived in the parking lot about four minutes after the first 911 call , and she began to look for the suspect with other law enforcement officers			0
a short time later , she saw the suspect			2
" he was approaching her at about 20 feet			0
he put his hands up , then reached under his jacket , pulled out the ( semiautomatic ) and she pulled out her weapon , " the lieutenant general said			0
" she engaged , and then he put the weapon to his head and he died of a self - inflicted gunshot wound , " @entity24 said			1
the shooting spree was over in about 15 or 20 minutes			0
the investigation into what spurred @entity11 's violent revolt promises to take much longer			1
@entity70 rep. @entity69 joined @entity24 in praising the military policewoman in a @entity73 interview thursday , saying she " responded exactly as the military would expect			1
" he further said that her quick reaction was a result of training that military police took after the 2009 @entity2 shooting , in which maj. @entity81 killed 13 people and wounded 31 others on the base			1
" that 's the active shooter program they 've all been through , " @entity69 said			0
" we can see that this is the training that was the result of the @entity81 shooting			1
i lived through the @entity81 shooting , and it was kind of eerie last night			2
" in 2009 , sgt. @entity92 , a civilian police officer , was washing her car and topping off the gas tank when she got the report that shots had been fired at @entity2			0
she and senior sgt. @entity99 responded to the scene and were directed to the @entity101			0
the 5 - foot - 2 , 125 - pound mother of two and her partner exchanged gunfire with @entity81 , who shot @entity105 three times , sending a bullet into each of her thighs and another into her knuckles			2
@entity105 and @entity99 were credited with ending @entity81 's rampage and hailed as heroes			1
@entity105 can no longer work in law enforcement because of her injuries and has spoken out on behalf of the victims , whom she claims the government has " betrayed " by denying them certain treatment and benefits in the aftermath of the shooting			0
though not much is yet known about the policewoman involved in ending wednesday 's shooting spree , @entity2 is home to the 89th @entity125 , a " combat - ready , deployable force " that can support worldwide operations , according to the brigade 's web page			2
@entity130 , a former @entity130 captain on the post , said he believes she was a junior enlisted soldier who was patrolling by herself			1
he credited her for facing the threat			0
" most police officers probably would have stepped back and waited for backup , but she stepped forward , " he said			0
@entity69 told @entity73 her training would have been 18 weeks and included a " shoot / no shoot , " class on a shooting course			0
" you have to make a decision on the range as to whether to engage or not , " he said			0
" they 're designed to create that split - second impulse because that 's all you would have in this kind of a situation			0
" @entity150 answers @entity152 users questions about the hero officer			0
