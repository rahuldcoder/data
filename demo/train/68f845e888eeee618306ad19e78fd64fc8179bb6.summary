@entity0 , @entity1 -- let 's not pretend @entity4 does n't have opinions			1
she 's human and must have strong views on the potential break - up of the @entity8 , which she represents			1
what matters is whether she expresses those views in public , which would compromise her constitutional role to remain impartial , and could undermine the position of the monarchy			0
the @entity4 has managed to " stay above politics " for more than 60 years -- and with @entity1 voting on independence thursday she 's not about to upset things now			1
the closest @entity4 has come to commenting on the referendum was something she said to a well - wisher outside a @entity1 church on sunday , that she hopes people " think very carefully about the future			1
" this is a rare moment of candor for someone who 's well aware that anything she says to a member of the public has the potential to be picked up by reporters , who she also knows have the referendum at the forefront of their minds			0
this came amid @entity8 newspaper reports that the @entity4 felt a great deal of concern over independence			1
her grandson , prince @entity40 , also appeared to step into the debate , according to some newspapers , when he was asked about his wife 's second pregnancy on the day it was announced			2
of course , he said , the couple were thrilled -- but then he added : " it 's important that we focus on the big news , the big international and domestic thing going on at the moment			0
" that comment was seen by parts of the @entity8 media as a reference to the @entity1 referendum			1
so what 's the official line ? a palace spokeswoman told me : " any suggestion that the @entity4 would wish to influence the outcome of the current referendum campaign is categorically wrong			1
her majesty is firmly of the view that this is a matter for the people of @entity1			2
" the @entity4 has come under pressure from some politicians to step into the debate but that idea was given short shrift			1
" @entity4 is above politics and those in political office have a duty to ensure that this remains the case , " said the spokeswoman			2
one of the @entity4 's great achievements has been to retain cross-party support in parliament throughout her reign ( remember , she came to the throne in 1952 )			2
she 's done this by refusing to take sides , in public at least			0
due to her popularity , she could sway opinion but royalty is about the long game			0
if she involves herself in policy then she risks alienating people and parliamentarians who could ultimately de-throne her and bring in a president			0
the queen 's role in @entity1 is n't actually at any immediate risk			1
the frontman of the pro-independence campaign , @entity1 first minister @entity98 , says he looks forward to the @entity4 remaining as " queen of @entity1 " in an independent @entity1			1
that does n't , however , do justice to the historic significance of the moment			0
the @entity8 was born out of the merger of the @entity107 and @entity1 royal families more than 400 years ago , which in turn led to the @entity110 and the joining of parliaments			1
this new country went on to build an empire that spanned the globe , at various points taking in the @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and much of @entity120			0
the managed decline of the empire after @entity123 is held up as one of @entity4 's great achievements			2
as territories broke away , she helped rebrand a @entity127 of independent nations			0
but bringing @entity1 into that fold has an entirely different significance			2
@entity1 is n't some breakaway outpost of the @entity132 ; it 's home turf which has remained uncontested since the @entity134			1
breaking up the @entity8 now would prompt an identity crisis for queen and country			1
factor in that her mother was @entity1 and it 's intrinsically personal too			2
the last time @entity4 touched publicly on this idea was in 1977 during a speech to mark her @entity144			0
at the time , @entity1 and @entity145 were voting on forming national assemblies			0
she said : " i can not forget that i was crowned @entity136 of @entity148 and @entity149			0
perhaps this jubilee is a time to remind ourselves of the benefits which union has conferred , at home and in our international dealings , on the inhabitants of all parts of the @entity8			0
" empires may come and go , but the queen 's facing the break - up of her home country			1
it 's personal and professional for her .			0

@entity1 votes this week on whether to become an independent country
@entity167 : the @entity4 has been careful not to become involved in the debate
the @entity8 *resulted* from a merger of the @entity107 and @entity1 royal families 400 years ago
the queen 's role in @entity1 is n't actually at any immediate risk , says @entity167
