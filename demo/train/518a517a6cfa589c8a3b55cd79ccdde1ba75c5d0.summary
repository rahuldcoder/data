-- @entity2 officials are pondering whether to strike @entity4 elements in @entity5 to better contain the group 's fearsome power , following its horrific execution of @entity9 and the direct threats it has leveled against the @entity2			1
as they consider how best to confront the organization , there is good news : the @entity2 and its friends have scored some successes against @entity4 in the past month			1
the administration provided material support to @entity18 and @entity20 special operations forces , and with judicious use of airstrikes enabled them to repel @entity4 attacks northwest and northeast of @entity25			1
the @entity27 administration wisely understood that these military operations are only a short - term fix			0
the only sustainable solution is a new @entity20 government able to rally a large majority of @entity20 across ethnic and sectarian lines to fight the @entity34 in @entity5			1
@entity20 have come together before to contain such extremists , and they could again			2
@entity20 's restive @entity38 @entity37 population , furious at former prime minister @entity39 , backed @entity4 in the @entity40 , but now @entity38 tribal figures in @entity42 and @entity43 , as well as some of the leaders from the urban business - political elite in @entity47 and @entity48 ad - @entity49 , have asked the @entity20 central government in @entity25 for help to fight the organization			1
success is not assured , but the picture is brighter than a month ago			0
@entity2 pressure -- and tying military assistance to concrete progress toward assembling a broad - based national government -- have encouraged the hesitant @entity20 forward			1
the @entity2 needs to sustain that approach			2
but even with progress in @entity20 , the @entity2 and its friends can not contain the @entity34 for long when it has a vast safe zone in @entity5 into which its fighters can fall back to rest , regroup , and fight again			1
as we contemplate a response , we should consider whether any of the strategies used recently in @entity20 could also be used in @entity5			1
in @entity20 , the @entity2 identified friends willing to fight the @entity34 on the ground			1
the @entity20 @entity71 @entity18 were not perfect -- they are not a regular army , their command structure is at times unwieldy , and their political agendas are not always compatible with ours			2
however , they were clearly able to help blunt the @entity4 advance , so cooperating with them was sensible			0
similarly , providing far more help to moderate elements of the @entity5 armed opposition makes huge sense			1
they are motivated and have been locked in combat against @entity4 for nine months			0
despite fighting an uphill battle against the well - armed regime of @entity5 president @entity86 , heavily backed by @entity87 and @entity88 , they have advanced in some regions			2
they share the same frustrating imperfections -- such as lack of professional discipline -- as the @entity18 and the @entity20 military , but if they were better armed and financed , the moderate @entity5 fighters could be helpful in repelling @entity4			1
they already did so by expelling it from northwest @entity5 earlier this year and the @entity98 area this summer			0
with stronger cash flows from governments in the @entity102 and @entity103 , they could also lure @entity5 away from @entity4 bankrolls			2
@entity2 airstrikes might be needed in @entity5 , but that would not be the most important tactic for success , nor would more material aid to the rebels be sufficient to contain the @entity34 over the long term			1
as in @entity20 , there has to be a political angle as well			0
helping a weakened @entity86 regime to consolidate its position in @entity98 is not a recipe for sustainable success			0
the regime ca n't roll back the @entity34 now -- it is attracting scores of new jihadis every day			0
helping @entity86 would multiply the numbers of recruits			0
rather , as in @entity20 , @entity5 needs a new government			1
the @entity2 had hoped this would be negotiated in @entity124 , where an international conference early this year aimed to find a political solution to the @entity5 conflict , but @entity86 rejected any serious negotiation			1
his @entity88 and @entity87 allies , estimating that he could survive , and seeing no alternative , made no effort to convince the regime to do otherwise			0
six months later , however , the regime 's pillars of support are weaker			0
there are reports that the regime earlier this month executed three air force pilots who had refused to obey orders			0
the minority @entity142 sect that has backed @entity86 is openly grumbling about heavy losses in an endless war against the moderate rebels and now the ruthless @entity34			2
a publicity campaign called " @entity149 " is under way in the @entity142 heartland			0
its complaint : @entity86 keeps his throne while our children go to their coffins			0
we need moderate armed opposition leaders in @entity5 to capitalize on this weariness by moving politically , not just militarily			2
as we boost aid to the moderate armed rebels , we must condition that help on their reaching out to disaffected regime supporters and developing with them a common political stance for a new , negotiated national unity government , with or without @entity86			1
the @entity86 regime wo n't go to the table easily , and the moderate rebels will need more help -- perhaps even hardware , like more mortars and rockets to hit airfields and bases and further rattle @entity86 's war machine			2
substantially boosting help to the moderate opposition would also compel @entity88 and @entity87 to rethink their blank check to @entity86 , especially if there is a better alternative route to contain @entity4			1
as it did with @entity20 prime minister @entity39 , @entity87 might consider other reasonable alternatives to the current @entity5 leadership			2
@entity87 wo n't , however , until it recognizes that @entity86 ca n't win and ca n't rally enough support to contain the @entity34			0
one prominent @entity2 observer says it is folly to think that we can aid the moderate armed fighters to topple @entity86			1
but toppling was n't our goal before and should n't be now			0
we should aim to help the @entity5 opposition inflict enough pain on the regime so that , despite @entity86 , the regime finally agrees to negotiate a new government whose first task will be to fight the @entity34 and eventually expel it from @entity5			1
in @entity5 's brutal , three - sided war , the @entity2 has no easy options			2
we have never controlled events there			0
it is also true that civil wars do n't always end in happy settlements			0
however , our inability to steer perfectly or to guarantee the best outcome ca n't be an excuse to maintain our current approach .			0

@entity208 : @entity2 mulling strike on @entity4 elements in @entity5
@entity2 pressure on @entity20 , *including* to form new government , has *bolstered* efforts to repel @entity4
he says aiding moderate @entity5 opposition would help them do the same , as @entity86 weakens
@entity219 : aid should hinge on rebels making new government with shared focus on driving out @entity4
