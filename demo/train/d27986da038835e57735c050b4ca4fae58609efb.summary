twenty - five years ago on march 24 , the oil tanker @entity1 slammed into @entity2 and spilled more than 11 million gallons of crude oil into the cold , clear waters of @entity6 's @entity5 -- one of the " last best places " on @entity9			1
the oil charged through @entity5 and out into the @entity11 , damaging more than 1,300 miles of some of the most remote , wild shoreline in this country			1
this happened 25 years ago , so we might note the anniversary as we do any other historical event			1
that , however , would imply that the oil spill is over			2
it 's not , and likely never will be			2
the sound 's coastal ecosystem is permanently damaged			1
thousands of gallons of @entity1 oil still pollute the beaches ; this oil is still toxic and still hurting the ecosystem near the shore			1
the government considers , as of 2010 , only 13 of the 32 monitored wildlife populations , habitats and resource services that were injured in the spill as fully " recovered " or " very likely recovered			0
" some are still listed today as " not recovering			0
" this includes a pod of orcas , which lost 15 of its 22 members after the spill , and has not produced a calf since			0
given only one older female is left , scientists appear certain that this unique pod of orcas will go extinct -- it 's just a matter of time			2
the government conclusion is that " there appears to be no hope for recovery			0
" the " not recovering " list also includes @entity54 herring , one of the sound 's keystone species			2
once the source of a vibrant commercial fishery , herring declined so precipitously that a fishery closed , and has not reopened			0
eight inches long , herring once swam in schools of a million or more , a sudden flash of their silver undersides confusing predators			2
in april , their spawning turned the bays and lagoons milky white			0
more than 40 species -- bald eagles , brown bears , seals , humpback whales , tufted puffins , murres -- depend on these small fish			0
those of us who knew the sound before the spill , the " bright and spacious wonderland " described a century ago by @entity83 's expedition , and who spend time in the magnificent coastal wilderness that remains , chafe at the idea of passing this 25th anniversary off as merely a historical event , of simply noting the date and then returning to business as usual			1
persistent oil poisoning , and a cascade of ecological effects , continue			0
there 's not much we can do now for @entity5 , short of protecting it from more harm			1
but we can keep from repeating our mistakes elsewhere			0
this is , after all , why we pay attention to history			0
unfortunately , we still have n't learned the biggest lesson of all from the @entity104 : the only real solution is to stop using so much oil			0
whether it 's @entity5 or the @entity108 , seldom is more than 10 % of the spilled oil recovered			1
this will be especially true in @entity112 waters			2
and regardless of how safe we make oil drilling , tankers , or pipelines , we 'll never reduce spill risk to zero			1
but the larger reason to reduce our dependence on oil is this : even if we as a society do n't care about oil spills destroying natural environments , we 've got to care -- eventually we will all care -- about how burning this oil is destroying our environment through climate change			1
as the south coast of @entity6 struggles to recover from one spill a quarter of a century later , @entity6 's polar bears are drowning from lack of @entity112 sea ice			1
it 's a sad irony that the push for @entity112 oil drilling has reached an all - time high			1
right now , as the polar bears ' ice shrinks , we are trying at a fever pitch to pull the very substance out of their ocean home that , when burned , will destroy their ocean home			0
no wonder one of @entity144 's founders , @entity145 , once called oil " @entity148 , " or the devil 's excrement			2
the best use of this anniversary is to do better , both by ourselves and the rest of the animal world with whom we share our planet			0
halting oil drilling in the @entity112 would be a clear first step toward doing better			1
it 's time for president @entity159 to take steps away from the " all of the above " energy policy and move us forward on a path to a clean energy future .			0

25 years ago , @entity1 spilled 11 million gallons of oil into @entity6 's @entity5
@entity167 : animals , coastal ecosystem damaged ; oil still pollutes beaches
she says no matter how we make drilling , tankers , pipelines safe , risk will never be zero
@entity167 : we need to reduce dependence on oil ; stopping drilling in the @entity112 is a first step
