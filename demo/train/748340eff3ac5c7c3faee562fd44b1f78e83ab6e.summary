-- in 1976 , @entity1 published an essay in @entity3 titled , " @entity4 : @entity5 of @entity6 , " which described how groups of women within the feminist movement attacked and ostracized those seen as too visible or ambitious			2
" to do something significant , to be recognized , to achieve , is to imply that one is ' making it off other women 's oppression ' or that one thinks oneself better than other women , " she wrote			2
the piece struck a chord , receiving more letters in response than anything else the magazine had printed			0
as various over-the - top denunciations of @entity27 coo @entity26 , the avowedly feminist author of " @entity28 : women , work and the @entity32 to lead , " suggest , it remains depressingly relevant decades later			1
not all the critiques of " @entity28 " have been unfair or unduly personal , but there has been enough viciousness directed toward @entity26 to indicate that a lot of women , some self - described feminists among them , still have a problem with female power			1
' having it all ' : 10 views with trademark alliteration , @entity45 columnist @entity44 called @entity26 a " @entity47 in @entity49 ankle boots			1
" a @entity51 column accused her of waging a " war on moms , " and @entity54 , writing in the @entity56 , went after her for relying on a staff " to help keep house , raise her children and throw her women 's leadership dinners			2
" unconsciously echoing @entity1 's essay , @entity63 wrote that there is " simply no way for women to lean in without leaning on the backs of other women			0
" this was especially ironic because @entity63 , who writes frequently about sex work , often argues that it 's wrong to assume that prostitutes are exploited , because that denies their agency			0
apparently men who hire hookers are n't taking advantage of them , but women who hire nannies are			1
why are women so much harder on other women than they are on men ? part of it seems to be because they expect so much more			1
the assumption that women should be altruistic and self - effacing pervades both mainstream society and some precincts of the feminist movement			0
it 's ok if women advocate on behalf of the collective , but not if they champion themselves			1
as @entity1 wrote , " among women there are two roles perceived as permissible : the ' helper ' and the ' helped			0
' " opinion : guilt poisons women this creates difficulties for women from both above and below			0
as @entity26 writes in " @entity28 , " women seeking raises and promotions ca n't simply use the same techniques as their male peers , because they 'll be judged far more harshly ; instead , she recommends that women smile a lot and speak in terms of " we " instead of " i. " she does n't dwell as much on how powerful women are regarded by those with less power , but the reception of her book has demonstrated that part of what 's tricky about women 's attempts to lead is getting others to follow			1
this is n't just about @entity26			1
polls pretty consistently show that women and men prefer male bosses over female ones , although the margin has been narrowing			1
interestingly , according to a 2011 @entity132 , those who have female bosses are more likely to say they 'd rather work for a woman			0
the aversion to female leadership , then , comes from prejudice rather than negative experience with actual women , and can dissipate as more women attain positions of authority			1
their quests for more authority , however , will continue to inspire disproportionate hostility			1
this does n't mean that @entity26 or any other woman deserves support simply for her gender			2
it does mean they should n't be held to a higher standard than men			0
balancing work and family : how do you make it work ? consider , for example , the very different way the activism of @entity27 co-founder @entity161 has been received			0
@entity161 , like @entity26 , is extremely , even obscenely rich , and he and his husband have used part of their wealth to become major champions of same - sex marriage			2
maybe someone somewhere has argued that their work for gay rights means little because it stems from self - interest , or that they should n't be focusing on a bourgeois issue like marriage that does little for , say , homeless gay teenagers			0
if such critics are out there , though , they 're certainly not on the pages of our major newspapers			0
when women have the temerity to marshal power on their own behalf , the response is much more negative , and one ca n't always tell the difference between those who resent women and those who resent power			2
as @entity1 wrote about " trashing , " it was often " clothed in the rhetoric of revolution and feminism			0
but underneath are some very traditional ideas about women 's proper roles			0
" editor 's note : join @entity200 on @entity27 for a live discussion about women and the workplace on tuesday from noon to 1 p.m. et. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			1

@entity206 : @entity26 *backlash* shows many women have issues with female power
it seems ok if women advocate for the collective , she says , but not if they blow their own horns
@entity206 : women seeking authority inspire disproportionate hostility , much more than men
she says women seem to be harder on each other because they expect so much more
