-- when @entity2 started her career in a car assembly plant at the age of 18 , she was a rare woman in a man 's world			1
today , 34 years on , she is the newly appointed vp of global purchasing for @entity9 , and trying to persuade more young women to reach the top in the car industry			1
before her appointment earlier this week , @entity13 was president and managing director of @entity9 , @entity16 for a year and a half			1
she takes up her new post in @entity19 at the end of january 2013			0
" i 'm honored that i was offered the position			0
it 's an important role in @entity9 , " she said			1
" this is a global job			0
i will be visiting other regions and seeing how things work			0
" i think it 's the cool thing that ( at ) @entity9 , not only do we have a lot of women in key leadership ( roles ) ... we have more women than any other automaker			1
i am proud our leadership believes in women in such positions			1
" @entity2 says she has " gas in my veins			1
" she studied engineering at what was then @entity41 , now @entity41 , in @entity42 , @entity43 , and has worked for the company ever since			1
before moving to @entity16 , she was chief engineer for vehicles such as the @entity46 and @entity47 , and then president and managing director of @entity9 in @entity50			1
" my feeling was always , i 'm going to get in and i 'm going to do the best job that i can and i will build my credibility from there , " she said			0
" with that attitude i was able to win over some skeptics , and for those who maybe did n't change their mind , i figured that 's their problem			0
that is not my problem			0
" despite the progress , @entity2 is still working in a male - dominated environment			2
women made up just under 21 % of employees in car manufacturing in the @entity67 , and 16 % of executives and senior management , according to a 2010 @entity71 report			1
yet women buy 52 % of all new cars in the @entity67 , and influence more than 85 % of sales , according to @entity75 , so manufacturers should have a high incentive for reaching out to women			1
@entity2 recognized this while working as chief engineer for the launch of the @entity46 in 2008			1
the car includes a dip in floor on the driver 's side for women wearing high heels			2
" the vehicle line executive was a woman , i was a chief engineer as a woman , my assistant chief engineer was a woman , a lot of my development engineers were women , our vehicle line director was a woman " said @entity2			1
" i do n't know if the vehicle would have turned out differently if we had n't had been a part of it			0
" when we were launching the @entity46 or the @entity47 , we did a lot of connection with mommy bloggers because we saw them as some of our key customers			0
it was a really great opportunity			0
" to encourage others to follow her into the boardroom , @entity2 has mentored young women , making sure they get the right assignments to make the most of their career			1
" i picked out five young women and i helped to move them where they needed to go , " she said			2
" i was able to take ( on ) these women and i tried to make sure they got the right assignments			2
" when they look at senior leaders , they think that their life can only be work			2
so one thing that i really try and share with young people is that you can have a successful career but also a successful family life as well			0
" also on leading women : how @entity131 's ' ceo of ideas ' puts creativity into action while @entity2 and others have successfully risen through the ranks , the industry is struggling to attract and retain women in its senior positions			1
when @entity141 compiled its list of " 100 leading women in the @entity144 " in 2010 , it found fewer women in the most senior positions than on its previous list in 2005			1
there were just two women ceos in 2010 , down from five in 2005 , and 51 women with executive officer titles , compared with 64 in 2005			1
@entity153 carried out a survey of the 100 leading women to find out what was going wrong			0
its report " women at the wheel " found 56 % of the women said their companies did not have an active recruitment program targeting women , and none thought the school system encouraged girls to pursue careers in the industry			1
one senior woman told the report that engineering needed to improve its image in line with the " @entity174 - ization " of other careers such as medicine and law			0
there are programs encouraging women in the industry			2
the @entity19 - based @entity182 and the @entity183 both offer scholarships to help women pursue careers in the industry			2
also on leading women : your top - flight lawyer ? she 's a stay - at - home mom in the @entity193 , @entity190 , outgoing executive chair of the @entity191 , which represents car retailers , is about to take over as chief executive of the @entity195			2
" we have got an image problem , and i do n't think the industry has done enough to educate teachers , parents and careers advisers about opportunities and what it 's like to work in the motor trade , " said @entity190			0
" there are lots of companies that go into schools in their localities , but we need to do that on a broader scale			0
" she said getting more girls to consider a career in engineering would be one of her top three priorities in her new job at the @entity195			0
@entity2 , too , believes the task starts in schools , persuading girls to consider engineering			2
" what we can do is really try and reach out to girls in middle school and high school , and talk to them about math and science , " she said			0
" we need to reach out to those young girls and make them see that they have the capability and then show them how engineering can be exciting			0
