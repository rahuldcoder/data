-- the rainy season is a good time to go to @entity3			1
it 's a lot cheaper and there are far fewer tourists			1
my visit was from july 22 to 31			1
even if there is a lot of rain , chances are that it will come down during your afternoon nap and clear up just in time for cocktail hour at 5:30 p.m. getting in and around @entity3 the trip began with my flight into the @entity20 area , which is where my @entity3 host and friend , @entity23 , lives			1
another friend visiting from the @entity26 picked me up and immediately , on the short trip from the airport to their home , we were confronted by the strange , small , bad roads and terrible driving that would be a theme for the entire trip			1
@entity23 made us wonderful ceviche -- also a theme -- when we arrived , and we chatted about how @entity37 or president @entity38 would solve the debt deadline			1
the next morning we set off			1
we rented a car for the week , a @entity40 , which we immediately noted had pretty bad brakes and a clutch that seemed to have little life left in it			1
we headed out of the city to @entity46 , one of the country 's most popular tourist attractions for its activity and nearby hot springs			1
we stopped at @entity52 for lunch in the tourist town @entity55 , which is at the base of the road around @entity46			1
then we continued around @entity46			1
the volcano , as it often is , was obscured by clouds			2
usually at night one can see the glowing lava , which sounded pretty cool			2
we thought of stopping for the evening in one of the resorts lining the base of the volcano , some of which are luxurious , but we decided to push on to the west coast			2
we stopped briefly at the seemingly out of place @entity69 / @entity68 chalet @entity70 , which is a hotel and fondue restaurant , but our timing was off for either lunch or dinner			2
experiencing the coast we explored @entity77 quickly but found it to be a little too noisy and busy			2
so we went one beach up to @entity80 and quickly found the @entity81 , which had clean , spacious villas , beautiful grounds and a nice small round pool			2
it seemed to be frequented mostly by @entity3 families			1
@entity87 lived up to its namesake ( beautiful ) the next morning			2
the water was calm , warm and clean			1
this was some of the best swimming we had the entire visit			1
just swimming casually we saw a skate shark and a puffer fish			1
couple escapes it all for ' paradise ' in @entity3 the next day we spent driving a considerable distance to @entity100 , on the southern tip of the @entity102			1
this drive was not for the faint of heart and had it been rainy , it could have been a dangerous , life - threatening drive			1
there were times when the going was steep and rocky			1
there were times when the driver was screaming in terror			2
the wear and tear on the car 's brakes and clutch were starting to make a lot of sense			2
even traveling fairly short distances in @entity3 should be considered carefully , because sometimes -- and by sometimes , i mean often or always -- there is a bridge out , necessitating a long , slow reroute			1
sometimes potholes are so omnipresent that you have to travel at 10 mph for hours , even in a rental car			2
unless you know the condition of a road , you can assume that you can make about 20 miles in an hour			2
but the difficulty is worth it			1
@entity100 was beautiful and full of young , fun people from all over the world			2
there 's excellent surfing there			2
we saw the most amazing sunset from @entity100 , one of those where the sun dips into the water at an alarming speed			1
from @entity100 we spent the next day traveling to @entity145 , where we spent four nights in the wonderful and small @entity147 , which had its own spot right on the beach			0
@entity150 was friendly without being intrusive or obsequious			0
he keeps a lame squirrel as a pet , so you know his heart is in the right place			1
the six - unit hotel has a small pool , beach furniture and clean , comfortable suites with kitchens -- including high - quality @entity163 blenders			0
they know what they 're doing there			0
also , a highlight was the rare @entity169 that @entity170 has parked out front			0
we were very excited to see that and on the last day , @entity170 let us play with it			0
zip lines and hatching turtles another highlight was the amazing @entity178 , which i would highly recommend			0
we swept between peaks on zip lines to see views of the ocean			0
we heard a variety of birds and saw a blue - crowned motmot , one of the most amazing birds i 've ever seen			0
our guides , brothers @entity190 and @entity192 , were warm , smart people who loved nature			0
they also set us up with a guide to the nearby nature refuge at @entity198 , where we went the next night to see green sea turtles lay eggs on the beach			0
these 4 - to 5 - foot - long turtles lay between 100 and 150 eggs in the sand before lumbering back into the sea			0
conservationists guard the eggs from poachers , who are pretty aggressive and sometimes dangerous			0
the experience was another highlight			0
we returned to @entity210 to spend two nights at my friend 's family 's house			0
no trip could be complete without a trip up to @entity218 to see coffee plantations , beautiful views , and the slumbering but active volcano and gorgeous @entity223			0
lunch on the mountain is recommended at @entity226 , where we had the most amazing strawberry drink -- fresas en leche ( strawberry in milk )			0
the local strawberries are wonderful in @entity218 , better than any i 've ever tasted			0
' @entity232 ' then it was back to the airport and a five - hour flight back to @entity236			0
i loved the @entity3 refrain " @entity232 , " which means " @entity238			1
" it 's sometimes used sarcastically , like when yelled at a passing motorbike			0
but its honest meaning is taken to heart in @entity3			1
the land is pure , the people are healthy			0
wildlife is revered and respected			0
they watch " @entity250 " in all the bars and restaurants			0
the people have good health care and the best free education system in @entity254			0
they seem happy , what can i say ?			0

driving through @entity3 not for faint of heart , but the peril is well worth it
steep , rocky roads lead to *breathtaking* sites like @entity46 , @entity102
beaches offer calm , clear water where you might find yourself swimming with sharks
