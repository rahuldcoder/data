a @entity1 investigative journalist was acquitted of criminal charges thursday after he published the names of about 2,000 @entity1 with @entity5 bank accounts , a move that embarrassed the country 's political and business elite			1
@entity9 , the editor of the magazine @entity10 , was charged with violating @entity1 's data protection law			1
he was arrested on sunday , a day after his magazine published the list , and acquitted thursday night , defense attorney @entity12 said			1
the names were known as the " @entity14 , " because they were given by @entity16 , then @entity17 finance minister , to her @entity1 counterpart in august 2010			2
@entity16 is now the @entity19 chief			0
@entity9 defended his decision to publish on the grounds that the data came from a reliable source and that it was in the public interest for it to be released			2
" in the last two years various names had been thrown about , " he told reporters outside the courthouse thursday			0
" people had been blackmailed			0
the political system is being destabilized			0
there was a fake list that had half the @entity1 lawmakers ' names on it			1
does n't this need to stop ? " while it is not illegal to hold a @entity5 bank account , and there is no evidence that anyone broke the law , suspicions are high in @entity1 that some of those named in the list may have opened the accounts to avoid paying taxes to the @entity1 state			1
@entity1 media questioned whether the failure to investigate those named for possible tax evasion might have been the result of an attempt by politicians to protect a wealthy elite			1
a parliamentary committee is looking into why no investigation was carried out either under former finance minister @entity61 or his successor , @entity62			0
the ministers said the data had been handed over to the fraud office , but officials there said they had never been formally instructed to investigate who on the list was or was n't dodging taxes			2
@entity17 and @entity72 authorities , who were given similar lists , did pursue some of those named for alleged tax evasion			1
@entity1 authorities now face public suspicion that they tried to shoot the messenger by sending @entity9 immediately to court , while for two years they effectively sat on the list and took no action			1
@entity12 said his client should have been praised for his courage in bringing the list to light rather than being taken to court			0
" the @entity1 government needs to investigate this list and any other lists they may have their hands on , " @entity12 told @entity87			2
" but first and foremost , the @entity1 government needs to reinstate effective governance , checks and balances and accountability and transparency mechanisms , in order for whatever is done to be productive , " he said			0
" we ca n't afford any more injustice , we ca n't afford any more mismanagement and we can certainly not afford lies that are smearing public life and are delegitimizing the public personnel in total at a time we need to work together			0
