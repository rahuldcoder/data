@entity0 -- the last time i sat down to interview @entity5 more than a year ago , he walked out on me , angered by questions about the allegations of sexual assault in @entity9			1
this time , holed up in the @entity10 in @entity0 , he had nowhere to go when asked the same question			1
@entity5 has taken refuge in the embassy for five months now , refusing to submit to questioning in @entity9 over those allegations			1
he denies doing anything wrong , and says the allegations are a ruse to get him to @entity9 , which would then , he claims , extradite him to the @entity20			1
" look ... there 's an attempt to extradite me without charge , without evidence allegedly for questioning			1
" @entity26 has granted the @entity28 founder asylum but the @entity30 government insists it is duty - bound to extradite @entity5 to @entity9			1
as a result , the @entity10 embassy is now @entity5 's home			1
if he steps outside , @entity30 police are standing by to arrest and extradite him			2
but when i met him again , @entity5 did not seem cornered at all			1
he was relaxed and friendly			1
rumors of ill health , that he had lost a lot of weight , did not appear to be true			2
he seemed at ease and , despite being confined largely to a small room in this tiny embassy , comfortable			1
and as if to prove there were no hard feelings , i received a warm kiss on the cheek			2
@entity31 life like ' a space station , ' @entity5 says earlier this week i received a call out of the blue : would you like to come and interview @entity5 tomorrow ? i was surprised , of course , but there was a good reason for it : @entity28 is in the process of releasing the " @entity56 , " more than 100 documents from the @entity20 @entity58 outlining the policies and procedures for such infamous prisons as @entity62 and @entity63 but others as well			1
so , the short answer to that question was : yes			2
the reunion took place on thursday morning			2
i 've been following the story of @entity28 and @entity5 for sometime now , before they made global headlines with the @entity72 , the @entity73 and the massive leak of more than 250,000 diplomatic cables from the @entity76			1
in 2010 , i had read a @entity78 article about a video , released by @entity28 , that showed an attack on civilians by a @entity20 @entity82 in @entity83 that killed , among others , a @entity86 cameraman and a father of two children who were also wounded in the attack			2
i was intrigued by the concept of @entity28 : an encrypted online platform that allowed whistleblowers to leak information anonymously			2
but i was also curious about the man behind @entity28 , @entity5			1
the article painted him as brilliant but enigmatic , staying up all night bent over a laptop receiving anonymous submissions for the @entity28 website			2
so , i thought i 'd email him , on the off - chance i got a response			2
to my surprise , a few weeks later , i got a phone call back			0
when i first met @entity5 , i asked him what more @entity28 had planned			1
i was taken aback when he told me casually : " we 're going to do something big			0
we 're going to end a war			0
" what i did n't know at the time was that @entity5 and @entity28 were preparing to launch the biggest leak of @entity20 classified documents in recent memory			1
nearly two years and a storm of controversy later , sitting in the same room where he delivered a speech to his supporters from the balcony of the @entity10 embassy , he told me : " we triggered the end of the @entity83 war			1
" he quickly added : " now , that 's a rather grandiose statement			1
" he cited commentator @entity123 and the logic goes something like this : @entity83 prime minister @entity127 cited documents leaked to @entity28 as the reason to withdraw legal protection extended to @entity20 soldiers in @entity83 which ultimately became one of the factors leading to the @entity20 troop withdrawal			0
for more on that , see the extended version of the interview here			0
personally , i think that 's overstating the impact of @entity28			1
but he has a point that @entity28 has changed the political landscape			0
governments and institutions now live in fear that they could become the next @entity28 headline			0
anyone with access and a flashdrive can now anonymously leak secrets to this global platform for all the world to see			0
of course , @entity28 has plenty of critics and it has suffered due to the allegations against @entity5 and its financial struggles			1
the @entity20 government has made it clear they believe @entity28 ' publishing of classified material is illegal and are currently building a case against him			0
@entity5 has also been heavily criticized for releasing classified material completely unredacted , potentially putting diplomatic sources into danger			1
but he has found plenty of support as well			0
nowhere more so than in the @entity10 embassy , a small place of fewer than a dozen rooms			1
@entity5 occupies an office now converted into a bedroom with a bed , a desk and a treadmill for exercise			1
about once a week , embassy staff say he practices boxing with a friend for more rigorous exercise			1
the embassy has installed a shower for him but there is n't much of a kitchen , so most of the food is takeaway delivered by his friends and embassy staff			1
" the situation here although i 'm confined in captivity to an embassy , is much better than being in solitary confinement in a prison			1
" he told me , " so , i am able to work , i am able to speak to you			0
so , in that sense my mind is free			0
" ambassador @entity198 says he has become part of the family			1
" it was difficult for us at the beginning , " she told @entity1			1
" we had a person living here 24 hours a day and we did n't know that person , his habits			0
how he was going to react to confinement			0
" what was not normal at the beginning has become normal			0
he is another one of us here			0
somebody that we count on , we talk to , we worry about when we think something has happened to him			0
we have now an extended and better run family			1
" his case has become a cause celebre , with @entity216 dropping by for tea and fashion designer @entity217 visiting to display her " i am @entity5 " t - shirt			1
small things have changed since i first met him			0
his white hair , once chin - length has been cropped short			0
he has ditched his t - shirts and leather jacket for a formal suit and tie			0
he 's far more media savvy now , at times sounding more like a politician than a former - hacker - turned - activist of global renown			2
but other things remain the same			0
he talks passionately about forcing transparency to transform and reform governments and bureaucracies , happily engaging in long debates			0
he still sees the world 's mainstream media as utterly failing in that regard and he 's still prone to making grandiose statements			2
he 's more guarded in interviews now			2
but occasionally you see some of his mischievous humour peeking through			0
in the interview , i asked him whether he considers himself as a dissident against @entity249 governments			0
here 's how he answered : " no. to be a dissident is simply to take the opposite position			2
" he added : " you can think of @entity28 as simply a function of education			0
we are just like a library			0
we collect information about the way the world works			0
and yes , we take the hardest possible case			0
we look for those things which are very hard to publish and support the rights of publishers and fight for their rights			0
" why do we do that ? well , because we want to live in a better world			0
but also because it 's fun			2
