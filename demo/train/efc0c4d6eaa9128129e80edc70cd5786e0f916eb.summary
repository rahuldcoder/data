-- struck by lightning , caught up in the smell of gas , braving two - inch hail and relentless rain : none of it could stop hundreds of firefighters , police officers , medical personnel , @entity11 and more from heading into the devastation around @entity13 , @entity14 , in a desperate search for survivors			1
nor could the fact that many of the first responders searched through the rubble of buildings at the same time many of their own homes had been eviscerated			1
amidst the struggles , there were victories : 17 people were rescued monday , city manager @entity23 told @entity0 's @entity28			2
" they 've lost their homes , but they have been out there for 40 hours saving lives , " @entity29 , deputy administrator for the @entity30 , said from @entity13			1
" the work they have done ... to say it is to be commended is an understatement			0
" not much more than 12 hours after the tornado touched down , @entity37 said that between 400 to 500 firefighters , public works personnel and other municipal employees showed up monday morning , unasked , hoping to help			2
the city manager said that the turnout , and the fact many others who have pitched in in other ways , is no surprise in @entity13 , a city of 50,050 residents in southwest @entity14			1
" @entity13 is a city of neighbors helping neighbors , " he said			1
" and with this spirit , we will overcome the hardship			0
" yet the continually confounding weather monday proved a major challenge			0
@entity37 said that two first responders were struck by lightning while looking through debris -- he did not detail the victims ' conditions afterward -- with persistent thunderstorms prompting a temporary halt to the searches			1
and even by monday evening , a full day after the twister struck , @entity37 said there were " gas leaks all over the city			0
" " when we drive around , we can smell the gas , " the city manager said			0
" and there are wires down everywhere			0
you have just got to be careful , as you navigate through the city			0
" the challenge does n't appear likely to get any easier tuesday			0
the @entity76 has said there is a 45 percent chance of another tornado outbreak between 4 p.m. and midnight tuesday over a wide swath that includes cities like @entity82 , @entity83 and -- yet again -- @entity13			1
those assisting in the rescue effort were n't just from @entity13			1
@entity14 gov. @entity86 noted that some of the more than 1,000 first responders came from @entity89 and other locales			2
that does n't include the 110 highway patrolmen and 250 @entity11 -- with another 450 on standby -- also on the scene			0
dr. @entity94 told @entity0 that doctors , nurses and others rushed to help , after the tornado ripped through @entity99			1
even with often impassible roads and treacherous weather , he said that , " within a matter of hours , we had almost more help than we could put to use			0
" " i just ca n't begin to tell you , " said @entity94 , who is heading the hospital 's triage unit as it treats and redirects patients coming in for help			2
" we 've had people coming from several hundreds of miles away , grabbing their stethoscope and anything they could get , and threw it in their car and came			2
" whether treating patients and searching for bodies , those on the frontlines in @entity13 also face a significant psychological toll of dealing with devastation that most of them have never seen before			1
@entity86 said they would likely have " very difficult shifts , ( because ) there are going to see things out there that are hard to see and hard to stomach			0
" still , voicing a sentiment echoed by officials and residents in @entity13 , the governor said it would n't prevent the first responders from heading out again , looking for survivors			1
" we are going to cover every foot of this town , and we 're going to make sure that every person is accounted for , " @entity86 said .			0

hundreds hit the *streets* of @entity13 , despite thunderstorms , looking for tornado survivors
a @entity30 official notes that many of these first responders had lost their own homes
others came from far away , like doctors who rushed to help at a stricken hospital
