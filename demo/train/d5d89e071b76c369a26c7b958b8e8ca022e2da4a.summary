@entity0 -- rescuers searching the stricken @entity3 found a body on bridge 3 tuesday , bringing the number of confirmed dead from the wreck to 16 , civil protection officials said			1
the discovery leaves about 16 people still missing from among the roughly 4,200 aboard the cruise liner -- about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members -- at the time of the collision with rocks off the island of @entity18			1
the vast majority fled the ship safely , if under chaotic and frightening conditions , according to survivors			2
undersea salvage experts will not start siphoning fuel off the partially sunken liner before saturday , the man in charge of the operation said tuesday			1
teams of divers have begun to set up the operation , @entity29 said in remarks televised from @entity18			2
his comments appear to contradict a timetable laid out monday by an @entity37 admiral , who said that salvage workers were to begin pumping fuel out of the liner that day			1
adm. @entity40 said it would take 28 working days to remove all the fuel from the ship			1
@entity29 did not explain the discrepancy			2
he has asked the company that owns the ship to come up with a plan to clean up pollution from the vessel , such as garbage , by wednesday , he said			2
the search for survivors and victims will continue alongside the salvage , said @entity29			1
the man in charge of the rescue operation said the divers faced a grim task			2
" imagine that you left for holidays and that the power went off in your house			1
what would you find in your fridge ? the divers are in there , " @entity64 said			2
two bodies were found on monday , and two more over the weekend -- one woman on saturday and one on sunday , both wearing life jackets			1
divers used explosives monday morning to blow more holes in the side of the ship to allow easier access			0
the parties involved in the rescue told reporters and residents on the island sunday that search and rescue efforts will continue -- but that the environmental risk is also becoming urgent			0
officials said they can not predict how long it will take to clear the wreckage , since that depends on maritime conditions and technical difficulties , but all legal , environmental and human factors will be taken into account			1
" it 's time for @entity95 to show it can do something right and do it well , " said @entity29			0
he warned that the task ahead was complicated and daunting , not least because it takes about 45 minutes to search each cabin , using special cameras and divers			0
the giant @entity3 had 1,500 cabins on board			1
a class - action lawsuit will be filed in @entity104 against @entity105 and its parent company , @entity107 , the @entity37 consumer group @entity108 said saturday			1
the suit , in collaboration with two @entity117 law firms , is " aimed specifically at getting compensation for all damages to the boat passengers , " @entity109 said in a statement			0
the class - action suit is open to passengers of any nationality , it said			0
" we 've been contacted by hundreds of victims and the numbers are growing moment by moment , " said @entity122 , senior partner at @entity123 , one of two firms involved			0
he said crew members have also contacted the firm , " and their stories that are coming in are horrific -- from lifeboats that were stuck halfway , passengers debating whether to jump or not			0
this was not an orderly evacuation			0
" the suit , he said , will request at least 125,000 euros ( about $ 160,000 ) per passenger			0
the suit has not yet been filed , said @entity141 , senior partner at the other firm , @entity144 , but " it will probably be in the billions of euros and dollars			0
" " the sheer terror of being on a ship of that magnitude going down , you can imagine the psychological damage , " @entity141 said			0
meanwhile , @entity29 said no fuel oil had yet leaked from the ship -- only kitchen and engine oil -- and that he did not see an immediate risk of the 2,400 tons on board escaping			1
booms have been put in place around the ship to stop the spread of oil and other pollutants such as detergents and sewage chemicals			0
with more than 4,000 people aboard , the ship was the size of a small town , @entity29 said			1
fuel will be replaced with water as it is removed from the ship 's tanks , keeping the ship balanced , said @entity40 , head of coastal authorities for the port city of @entity173			2
@entity29 said @entity105 , the company that owns the cruise ship , is cooperative and was proving responsible , despite past errors			0
both @entity105 and authorities have criticized capt. @entity177 , who is under house arrest and faces possible charges of manslaughter , shipwreck and abandoning ship			1
prosecutors have accused the captain of piloting the ship too fast to allow him to react to dangers , causing the shipwreck , according to legal papers			2
