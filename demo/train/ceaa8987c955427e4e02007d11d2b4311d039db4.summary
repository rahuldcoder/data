-- the finish line is almost here			0
@entity2 have weighed a plethora of questions in choosing their presidential candidate			2
but amid the quadrennial explosion of political ads , bumper stickers and debates , some questions still baffle : why is the @entity12 mascot an elephant ? why are democrats linked to the color blue ? and what happens if the candidates tie ? below , a voter 's guide to such perpetually confounding riddles : @entity21 why are presidential elections always in november , and always on tuesdays ? it all comes down to weather , harvests and worship			1
back when voters traveled to the polls by horse , tuesday was an ideal day because it allows people to worship on sunday , ride to their county seat on monday and vote on tuesday - all before market day , wednesday			1
and the month of november fit nicely between harvest time and brutal winter weather -- which can be especially bad when you 're trudging along by horse and buggy			0
politics : plenty of ballot initiatives but since many voters now travel by horsepower instead of live horses , some people -- like the group why tuesday ? -- are pushing to move election day to a weekend day to increase the country 's historically dismal voter turnout			1
according to the group , 15 states do not allow early voting , and 27 % of non-voters said the main reason why they did n't vote was because they were too busy or could n't get time off to vote			0
@entity21 why do @entity12 have an elephant and @entity14 have a donkey ? back in 1874 , cartoonist @entity60 used an elephant to depict the @entity12 vote in his drawing " @entity63			1
" the cartoon was published in @entity65 after the owner of the @entity67 reportedly criticized the notion of @entity12 president @entity69 running for a third term			1
( @entity69 did n't end up running in the next election )			0
in the drawing , an " ass " -- depicting the @entity67 -- scares away other animals in a forest as the elephant -- or the @entity12 vote -- looks like it 's about to stumble into a pit			2
but that cartoon is n't where where the @entity14 donkey came from			1
in 1828 , democrat @entity84 's critics called him a " jackass " because of his populist views and his slogan , " let the people rule			0
" @entity84 decided to run with it -- even using images of a donkey in his campaign ads. later , @entity60 also used a donkey to depict the @entity14 party			2
@entity21 why are @entity14 states " blue , " and why are @entity12 states " red " ? there 's nothing magical about this color scheme			1
essentially , the media made it up			0
find your ballot , polling place sure , there are logical reasons to use red and blue -- both are colors in the @entity2 flag , and they look sharp on infographics because they 're pretty much on opposite ends of the color spectrum			2
but the seemingly arbitrary color assignments have actually flip - flopped over the years			1
in 1980 , states won by @entity12 @entity116 were colored blue ; democrat @entity118 's states were colored red			2
even as late as 1996 , major media outlets were divided on how to color - code the parties			2
but in 2000 , when @entity2 were subjected to weeks of news about recounts , pregnant chads and electoral infographics , everyone seemed to get on the same page and shaded @entity12 - leaning states red and @entity14 - leaning states blue			1
q. what happens if candidates tie in electoral votes ? it 's possible that @entity135 and @entity136 snag the exact same number of electoral votes			1
in that case , the @entity139 says the @entity141 gets to pick the president			0
and since analysts expect @entity12 to maintain control of the @entity141 , @entity136 would likely win the presidency			1
pick your electoral map in the same scenario , the @entity148 would get to choose the vice president			0
and because democrats are expected to keep control of that chamber , senators could select incumbent vice president @entity155 to form a split administration			0
politics : could close race produce a popular / electoral vote split ? @entity21 why do presidents have to wait all the way until january 20 to assume office ? it used to be a lot longer			0
until 1937 , presidents did n't get sworn in until march 4 because it took so long to count and report ballots , and because of the winner 's logistical issues in moving to the capital			0
but then better technology kicked in , and the 20th amendment moved presidential inaugurations to noon on january 20 -- allowing presidents to start taking care of business sooner .			0

the @entity14 donkey and the @entity12 elephant started with *negative* *connotations*
some people are campaigning to move @entity182 from tuesday to a weekend day
if @entity136 and @entity135 tie , the @entity2 could get a @entity12 president and a @entity14 *vp*
the color assignments for @entity12 and @entity14 have flip - flopped over the years
