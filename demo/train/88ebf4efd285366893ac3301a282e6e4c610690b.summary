-- @entity2 's cover story , which hit the newsstand thursday , argues that @entity5 voters will cast the deciding vote in the upcoming election			0
after watching the @entity11 candidates lock the kryptonite that is the immigration issue around their necks during the @entity15 debate , my bet is that president @entity16 could win another term -- even if he loses key swing states such as @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 -- but he must make sure he accomplishes one thing first : connect with @entity27			1
@entity11 have not connected with @entity5 ; the candidates ' approaches to immigration are not compelling and lack substance , from talk of double 30 - foot electrified fences to anchor babies and self - deportation			1
in fact , it could very well be that the 20 @entity39 voters on the cover of @entity2 and half a million more will turn out to vote in @entity15 and flip the state to @entity16			1
@entity16 comes into the election with 196 electoral votes from safe @entity45 states			2
if he takes @entity15 and if @entity47 voters help him flip @entity48 , which @entity49 won by fewer than 4,000 votes , and help him retain @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 , then @entity16 wins with 279 electoral votes , nine more than the 270 needed			2
if he can retain @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 or @entity25 , also populated with many @entity5 swing voters , then he could win in a landslide			2
it is clear , then , that connecting with @entity5 voters could very well be a tipping point for the president ; the question is how to make that connection			1
in his book " the political brain : the @entity68 in deciding the @entity69 , " @entity67 convincingly argues that " people vote for the candidate who elicits the right feelings , not the candidate who presents the best arguments			0
" beyond the shared concern for economic growth , jobs , education and health care , @entity27 are focused on immigration because the majority of the undocumented workers living here are from @entity84			1
this is an issue that resonates at a deeply emotional level with @entity27 , whether they are descendants of @entity89 colonists or a recently arrived @entity91 sleeping on a cousin 's couch			1
thus to really , deeply connect with @entity47 voters , any candidate needs to address the immigration issue by supporting comprehensive immigration reform and the @entity97 , which would provide a path to citizenship for those who earn a college degree or serve two years in the military			0
this is a vital first step to earning the trust of @entity47 voters , who understand that the country needs strong border security but also know that we need a fair way to deal with the nearly 10 million economic refugees who are working in this country and contributing to our society			0
it 's a matter of respect			0
so how does @entity16 -- who has a dubious record himself on immigration -- win the latino vote ? first he wins the ground war in the battleground states , which is door - to - door combat			1
next he outspends @entity11 in spanish - language media , just like he did @entity49 in 2008 , by five to one			2
it 's no coincidence that on tuesday , @entity16 did an interview with @entity84 - based " @entity122 , " the most influential @entity89 - language radio personality in the country			2
the president reassured @entity27 that he is strongly committed to passing comprehensive immigration reform and lambasted the @entity11 for its extreme views and intransigence on the issue			1
@entity5 want to feel they are voting for an authentic leader			0
hispanics do n't have to agree with every position @entity16 takes , but they must believe in and identify with his worldview			2
he needs to explain that the @entity45 is a welcoming place for @entity5 , that his world view of @entity84 is that of a caring , responsible , family and that his political ideals are based on empathy and fairness			0
getting these ideas across to @entity27 is vital to securing their votes			2
once @entity16 has established a deep emotional connection with @entity27 , he can connect directly to the heart of @entity5 voters with three simple messages : 1			1
under @entity16 's leadership , an economy that was losing 500,000 jobs a month in the final months of 2008 is now gaining more than 200,000 jobs per month			1
his policies are working ; they just need more time			0
despite unanimous opposition from @entity11 , @entity16 fulfilled his promise of making health care available to all @entity158			1
now 32 million more @entity158 -- including @entity5 -- will be able to afford insurance for the first time			0
the president doubled the government 's investment in scholarships and financial aid , making college more affordable to millions of @entity158			0
now students from working - class @entity47 families can go to college and get good jobs			0
on the contrary , @entity11 may blow hard about their understanding and affection for @entity5 , munching on burritos in the barrio on the campaign trail , but the evidence of authenticity of leadership and the strong record crucial to the @entity5 vote are just not there			0
the refusal of all the @entity11 candidates to really look at immigration and offer a plan -- despite the glad - handing and tepid avowals of commitment -- makes it clear that the @entity11 just does n't have the deep connection with @entity27 necessary to pull off a win in november			1
join the conversation at @entity194 / @entity193 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			0

@entity197 : @entity11 ' stance on immigration gives @entity16 *opportunity*
he says the president needs to establish an emotional connection with @entity27
@entity16 can point to health care , improving economy , greater scholarship money , he says
@entity197 : if @entity27 go strongly for @entity16 , he could win in a landslide
