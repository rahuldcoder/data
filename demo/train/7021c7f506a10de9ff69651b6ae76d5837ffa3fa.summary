in the same week that witnessed the fall of @entity2 in the hands of the @entity5 regime both the @entity6 and the @entity7 announced a resumption of non-lethal aid to the @entity11 rebels			1
while this is a highly symbolic move towards an opposition desperate for any kind of support , it is also symbolic in that it is unlikely to affect the balance of power on the ground			0
the @entity6 and @entity7 contribution is dwarfed into insignificance when compared to military , economic , logistic and diplomatic support that the regime gets from its allies , mainly @entity26 and @entity27			1
the truce in @entity2 is a clear consequence of failing @entity31 support to the opposition and the full support that the regime gets from its allies			1
a balance sheet that compares aid to the regime against that given to the opposition demonstrates clearly the imbalance in favor of the @entity5 regime			0
this goes some way in explaining two phenomena : one is the disappointment towards the @entity49 administration felt by many of its @entity52 allies and by the @entity11 opposition who feel let down by the @entity6 ; two is the way in which @entity27 and @entity26 see military engagement and support to the regime in @entity11 as an integral part of their political and diplomatic strategy , while the @entity6 and the @entity7 seem to consider them as two separate processes : you either provide military support to the opposition or push for a diplomatic solution and can not do both			1
@entity6 aid of up to $ 27 million and @entity7 aid of Â£ 1 million ( $ 1.69 million ) both in non-lethal aid like communications , medical equipment and food rations are being resumed after they had been suspended in december in the run - up to the @entity79 talks and only came up again after the failure of the diplomatic solution in @entity79 @entity27 and @entity26 aid to the regime has been continuous and much more substantial			2
western policy in @entity11 projects weakness , hesitation and lack of strategy while @entity27 and @entity26 have shown strength , resolve and their policy is part of a wider strategy in confrontation with the @entity6 the @entity6 was also pressuring its own regional allies like @entity96 , @entity97 and other @entity99 countries to restrain their support for the opposition mainly on the grounds that a military solution was impossible			1
@entity26 and @entity27 assistance it is difficult to accurately estimate the @entity26 and @entity27 contributions			2
the @entity108 report on @entity11 's war economy mentions financial help of up to $ 5.8 billion in the form of cash and oil supplies in mid 2011 and two credit facilities in 2013 worth a combined $ 4.3 billion			0
@entity115 , the former head of the @entity116 recently claimed that @entity26 assistance to the regime is well over $ 14 billion so far			0
the figures would shoot up if military assistance could be estimated			1
what we know is that the @entity124 force , the foreign arm of the @entity126 has hundreds of commanders involved in @entity11			0
@entity26 also arms and trains @entity130 in @entity131 and several @entity133 militias that are fighting in @entity11 and sends arms and munitions			2
the strain on the @entity26 economy is unsustainable and there are already @entity26 dissident voices blaming involvement in @entity11 for a large part of the country 's economic problems			2
@entity27 also provides economic and military assistance to the regime , propping up the currency and circumventing the sanctions			1
@entity11 currency is now printed in @entity27 and military assistance is both technical and hardware			1
the balance sheet also includes billions of dollars of @entity31 humanitarian aid that goes through the @entity153 and other international organizations			0
the bulk of it goes to dealing with the symptoms of the war - like refugees and the rest largely goes through the regime and the regime uses it to its benefit in its surrender or starve strategy in sieges like that of @entity2			2
the scenario is simple : the regime cuts off water , electricity , food , fuel and access ; it then proceeds to bomb the city into submission using artillery , air raids and barrel bombs			0
and then the @entity153 and other international organizations who are also @entity31 funded , help the regime and its allies to negotiate surrenders that are euphemistically called " local ceasefires " as we have seen in @entity2 and in other areas recently			1
difference in strategy the difference in strategy is flagrant : @entity26 and @entity27 boost military assistance to strengthen @entity5 's hand in the negotiations ; while the @entity6 and the @entity7 all but freeze support to the opposition which amounts to pressuring them to compromise in negotiations			1
@entity199 even argues in a @entity201 piece that the main reason for president @entity49 's hesitation to assist the rebels in @entity11 is so as not to jeopardize his engagement with @entity26 under the logic that you can not talk and shoot at the same time			0
there may also be different perceptions of the importance of the conflict in @entity11			0
the @entity212 may perceive it as marginal at a time when it is shifting its interest away from the @entity216 to @entity217			0
it is thus a local conflict where you could stand aside and wait to see which side would win			0
@entity26 and @entity27 are playing to win and see it as a more strategic battle with objectives beyond @entity11 possibly against the @entity6 and its global power			2
it may also be argued that perceived @entity6 weakness can not be confined to its position in @entity11			0
while it has disappointed its allies who feel let down ; it has at the same time emboldened its enemies who feel they can take advantage of it			0
@entity27 can thus think it can get away with bold moves in @entity233 and @entity26 thinks it can play the classic trick of good - cop / bad - cop where good - cop is president @entity237 with a smile and a tweet , willing to negotiate but only on the nuclear deal ; and the bad cop is general @entity242 the commander of the @entity126 and has a free hand to fight against @entity6 interests in @entity133 , @entity11 , @entity131 , @entity246 and other areas the @entity248 is active in			1
if anything , this is a situation similar to that in @entity133 in 1991 when an uprising was encouraged by @entity253 , and then the @entity6 and its allies stood by watching @entity256 's helicopters crush it , killing in two months as much as @entity5 has in the last three years .			1

the @entity2 truce is a consequence of failing @entity31 support to the opposition , writes @entity262
@entity27 provides economic and military assistance to the @entity11 regime , he says
@entity262 : the situation is similar to that in @entity133 in 1991 when an uprising was encouraged by @entity253
