-- we could all learn a few things from @entity3 , and when you read the essay she penned for @entity6 , " @entity7 , " you undoubtedly will — maybe even about yourself			1
that is , judging by the excerpts of her article , which the magazine released tuesday , ahead of publication			0
most of the world will be looking for the salacious details of her " consensual relationship " with president @entity18			1
as many will recall , that affair began in 1995 and when news of it broke in 1998 , it became a global story			1
it almost took down the president — he was impeached -- and sent @entity3 into such an isolated state of hell , she writes , that she had suicidal thoughts at times and a " fear that i would be literally humiliated to death			1
" frankly , when you consider just how intense , relentless and abusive the @entity3 bullying has been for the past 16 years -- by the media , the politicians , the public and trolls on the @entity38 , it 's a wonder she had the psychological stamina to resist those suicidal thoughts			1
and thank @entity41 she did			0
@entity3 on @entity18 affair : ' time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress ' you ca n't underplay how huge the news of the @entity3 - @entity18 affair was at a time when the @entity38 was n't only used for trolling celebrities ; it had such an impact in the public arena that there are people who are still making money off it			1
the founder of the @entity56 , @entity57 , broke the story of the affair on his then mostly unknown website in 1998 ; the story put him on the map			1
in 2014 the site averages more than a billion page views a month			0
when @entity65 interviewed @entity3 in 1999 on " 20/20 , " a record - breaking 70 million viewers tuned in			1
while the media pointed fingers at " that woman , " it was taking advantage of the hottest story in presidential scandal history and squeezing every dollar it could out of @entity3 's demise			1
@entity77 , when @entity82 " dropped " her album in december 2013 , she cashed in as well -- reducing @entity3 to a line in " @entity79 " as a reference to ejaculation			1
@entity3 replied in her essay : " thanks , @entity82 , but if we 're verbing , i think you meant ' @entity87 all on my gown			1
' " sexual affairs are happening all over the world at this very moment -- with politicians , world leaders , famous actors and people you know personally			0
yes , affairs and other indiscretions are disgusting and immoral , but you can hardly be surprised anymore when you hear about them ( looking at you @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 )			0
after all , you do n't publicly execute people for these everyday offenses between two consenting adults , and yet that 's basically what the world did to @entity3			1
last year , president @entity18 was awarded the @entity111 by president @entity112			2
in 2014 , perhaps the world will give @entity3 the freedom she finally deserves			2
the powerful story here is n't the cigar and the blue dress with semen on it , it 's that after 16 years of relentless bullying and a past that wo n't go away , @entity3 has figured out a way to use the experience to help others by taking ownership of it			1
@entity3 writes that she may be the first person ever at the center of an internet cyberbullying event , and that it was the case of another recent victim of similar bullying , @entity134 , that made her own suffering " take on a different meaning "			1
@entity137 ' relationship with media still testy after all these years " perhaps by sharing my story , i reason , i might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation			2
" in the same way that a sitting president can sooth a community struck by a hurricane , mudslide or mass shooting , i have no doubt that @entity3 could help a victim of cyberbullying get through the pain and humiliation -- and be instrumental in encouraging him or her to stay strong			2
one of the most powerful tools you have in life is the truth , and here 's the truth : regardless of what she says , people will judge			0
pundits will pontificate , project and wonder aloud about political motivations in the timing			0
we will wonder if this will hurt @entity170 in 2016 or if @entity3 was paid by the @entity171 to unburden herself like this			2
go down that road and you miss something way more powerful than politics -- a lesson in humanity and personal power			0
she writes that it 's time to " stop tiptoeing around my past — and other people 's futures			0
i am determined to have a different ending to my story			0
i 've decided , finally , to stick my head above the parapet so that i can take back my narrative and give purpose to my past			2
" by telling her story , she 's doing exactly that			0
it takes remarkable courage to confront your humiliating mistakes and painful past , and still hold your head high			0
it 's in our failures that we often find our strength			0
good for you @entity3 , you found your strength			2
i for one will be cheering you on .			0
