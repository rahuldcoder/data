-- @entity1 sent mixed signals wednesday on chemical weapons in @entity4 -- with its foreign ministry pinning the blame for one such attack on a rebel group hours after its president refused to close the door on a @entity12 - approved strike against @entity4 's government			1
as one of @entity4 's top allies -- and one with veto power on the @entity17 -- @entity19 time and again has stymied efforts to punish @entity4 president @entity22 's government for launching attacks killing innocent civilians and using weaponry derided by the international community			1
such calls intensified after an alleged chemical weapons attack last month outside @entity29 that , the @entity31 government estimates , left upward of 1,400 people dead			1
@entity34 and @entity31 legislators spent wednesday debating the merits of authorizing military strikes in @entity4			2
@entity1 has challenged assessments from officials in those nations and @entity40 that @entity4 forces have used chemical weapons since the bloody civil war broke out in 2011			1
on wednesday , @entity1 president @entity44 said he " does n't exclude " backing a @entity12 resolution for military action , though only if there is irrefutable proof @entity4 's government is behind the latest attack			1
samples taken by @entity12 inspectors at that site were due at the world body 's laboratories this week and will be tested " strictly according to internationally recognized standards , " @entity12 @entity51 ban ki - moon said			1
@entity44 also said , in the same interview with @entity1 's state @entity60 television and the @entity62 , that it would be " absurd " for @entity22 's forces to use chemical weapons when they have the upper hand over rebel fighters			1
the @entity4 government not only has denied waging chemical weapon attacks , it has accused opposition fighters -- whom it routinely refers to as " terrorists " -- of using them			1
@entity1 's foreign ministry appeared to echo that view , in at least one instance , on wednesday			1
referencing a march 19 attack ( not the one on august 21 ) in an @entity79 suburb , the ministry said its experts -- in an analysis requested by @entity4 authorities -- concluded that 26 civilian and @entity4 military deaths from the spring attack can be traced to a " homemade " device not used by the @entity4 army			1
the projectile , the @entity1 ministry stated , was similar to those used in northern @entity4 by @entity90 , an @entity92 brigade that 's part of the opposition @entity94			1
in addition to hexogen , the @entity1 experts found the nerve agent sarin and another such chemical in its shell and soil samples			1
' red line ' debate : are chemical weapons worse ? how this revelation affects the dynamics in @entity4 , and internationally , is uncertain			1
@entity31 and some allied officials , for example , have expressed reluctance to accept such claims in the past			0
moreover , they have indicated their willingness to wage targeted strikes in retaliation to the more recent strike , even without sweeping global support			2
the competing claims suggest that world leaders -- as has been true in the two years since the conflict began , leading to more than 100,000 deaths according to a @entity12 estimate -- are n't close to an agreement about who 's to blame for the bloodshed and what to do about it			1
nor is there a sense the conflict is near an end			0
the @entity132 , a network of opposition activists , reported @entity4 forces shelled more than 450 sites wednesday , contributing to at least 72 more deaths			1
the official @entity4 @entity138 , known as @entity139 , tweeted about @entity141 troops clashes with terrorists , who it blamed for the death of national taekwondo team member @entity145			1
meanwhile , government officials , such as presidential adviser @entity147 , remained critical of efforts of those who might strike without @entity12 backing , saying they -- and not the @entity4 government -- would pay a steep price			1
" the @entity4 people will never leave , they will always be here , " @entity152 said wednesday on @entity40 's @entity153			2
" but those who lead the aggression will leave , and they will ( live with ) the results of this aggression			2
" @entity34 , @entity31 lawmakers debate action echoing top @entity31 officials , @entity34 leaders pressed lawmakers in @entity164 to back a military strike to send a clear message to @entity22			0
five things we learned from @entity170 hearing on @entity4 " not to react would be to put peace and security of the entire region in danger , but also beyond that , our own security , " @entity34 prime minister @entity171 told a combined session of the @entity170 and @entity173 , arguing that inaction would give those with chemical and nuclear weapons a green light to use them			2
a similar debate is playing out in @entity187 , where the @entity188 voted 10 to 7 for a resolution backed by president @entity190 to authorize a targeted @entity31 military action			0
that decision sends the measure to the full chamber for a vote next week			0
read the @entity170 draft resolution (			0
pdf ) secretary of state @entity198 , meanwhile , again made the @entity190 administration 's case wednesday , this time to the @entity201			0
@entity198 said some @entity31 allies in the @entity206 " have said that , if the @entity31 is prepared to do the whole thing , ... they will carry that cost			0
" the top @entity31 diplomat also stated -- as he has previously -- that a military ' strike would be focused on addressing the chemical weapons threat , and that it would be effective			0
" we have absolute confidence that what our military undertakes to do , if it is ordered to do so , will degrade the capacity of @entity22 to use his weapons and serve as a very strong deterrent , " @entity198 said			0
yet as was the case a day before with the @entity188 , not everyone was convinced			0
rep. @entity221 , a @entity223 @entity222 , claimed most members of the @entity4 opposition are " radical extremists , " saying that every time he asks @entity31 officials about them , " the answers get worse and worse			2
" @entity198 countered that about 15 % of the rebel fighters are " bad guys " who fare fighting each other			0
" there 's a general belief that a real moderate opposition exists " he added , saying aid in being carefully funneled to this faction which is " only getting stronger			0
" four questions for backers of @entity4 mission still , even within the @entity190 administration , there are questions as to how much the rebel movement can be trusted			2
" we do not see the clear division between moderates and extremists that some have suggested , " a @entity31 official told @entity0 , adding that " all these different elements are mixed in			0
" @entity252 : ' we will support @entity4 to the end ' @entity190 said last year that the use of chemical weapons in @entity4 's civil war would cross a " red line " for @entity31 intervention			1
international agreements ban the use of chemical weapons , and many @entity263 leaders worry that allowing their use to go unchecked in @entity4 could weaken that prohibition			2
" as much as we 're criticized , when bad stuff happens around the world the first question is , ' what is the @entity31 going to do about it ? ' " @entity190 told reporters wednesday in @entity267 , @entity268 , after meeting with @entity268 prime minister @entity269			0
" the moral thing to do is not to stand by and do nothing , " he said			0
is it ' @entity278 ' for @entity190 on @entity4 ? not everyone -- including longtime @entity31 allies -- agree military action now is the answer			0
@entity269 , for instance , said the world must seek a " political solution			0
" @entity286 , a former @entity12 secretary - general , said there is " no military solution			2
" and @entity290 lawmakers last week voted to preclude military involvement			0
then there are some who are standing firmly by @entity4 's embattled government			1
@entity1 , for one , has historically close economic , political and military ties with @entity4 , having likely more than $ 4 billion in contracts with @entity1 's defense ministry , according to @entity298 , an adjunct fellow at the @entity299 and @entity300			1
@entity19 also signed a $ 550 million deal with @entity4 for combat training jets , and @entity44 noted that it 's given its ally some parts of an air defense missile system but has frozen additional shipments			2
@entity252 -- in addition to being one of @entity31 and @entity310 's staunchest foes -- has been @entity22 's biggest backers throughout			0
on wednesday , @entity313 commander gen. @entity312 pointed fingers at neighbors such as @entity316 for backing what he said was an overwhelmingly foreign rebel fighting force , according to a report in @entity252 's semi-official @entity322 news agency			2
@entity323 wo n't let its friend down , he told @entity252 's assembly of experts			0
" we will support @entity4 to the end , " @entity312 said			0
@entity4 missile strike : what would happen next ? @entity0 's @entity330 and @entity331 contributed to this report .			1
