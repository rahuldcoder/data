@entity0 -- the initial review of the materials confiscated from @entity5 's compound in @entity6 has found mostly " aspirational " planning but has yielded " real intelligence , " according to a @entity10 official			1
the official , who was not authorized to speak on the record , said it is still very early in the review , and there are still a lot of data to sort through to determine whether there are any concrete plots			2
the special task force set up to examine the data has two initial goals , according to the official : check to see whether there are any imminent threats against the @entity10 and find leads to other terrorists or plots			1
the reviewing team is running around the clock , according to the official			0
the task force assigned to scour the seized material is run by the @entity31 , with dozens of representatives from throughout the intelligence community working 24/7 , searching for clues			1
most of the team is poring over the digital , audio and video files as well as printed and handwritten materials from an undisclosed location in the @entity0 area , but some of the members are participating virtually			0
the effort to decipher the data is time - consuming because much of it has to be translated , some is handwritten , and large digital files have to be transferred			0

" but there is no indication of any specific plot to attack those targets			0
the senior official said the @entity10 believes that the bin laden compound was in effect a command and control center for @entity63 because the confiscated materials " clearly show that @entity5 remained an active leader in @entity63 , providing strategic , operational and tactical instructions to the group			1
though separated from many @entity63 members who are located in more remote areas of the region , he was far from a figurehead			0
" according to the first @entity10 official , there is " real intelligence coming out of this			2
" the official said the intelligence community expects to gain insights into how @entity63 operated			1
" we expect to learn more how @entity5 communicated , who he communicated with and how often he did it , what guidance did he pass on , what questions were passed on , how he operated , how he ran @entity63 and what did other people expect from @entity5 , " said the official			2
at some point , the @entity10 expects to share some of what it is learning with other relevant nations and parties who might be able to exploit it further , but until they know more about what they have , the official said it 's too early for an exchange of information .			0
