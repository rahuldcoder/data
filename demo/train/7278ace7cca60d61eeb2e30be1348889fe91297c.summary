-- the comedian @entity1 used to complain , " i do n't get no respect			0
" sometimes , it feels like those words ought to be printed on the presidential seal			0
last week , @entity6 was interrupted by @entity8 journalist @entity7 while making a statement on immigration			1
@entity7 shouted questions at him until the president was forced to stop and demand silence			0
many media outlets , particularly those with a liberal bent , were outraged			0
the @entity18 @entity17 called it " a breach of etiquette so severe it managed to shock even the notoriously unfastidious journalistic profession			0
" an @entity24 panel acknowledged that news conferences under @entity26 and @entity27 could get awkward , but concluded that @entity6 gets even rougher treatment because of the color of his skin			1
the fact that @entity7 was shouting questions about immigration only added to the impression that the president 's conservative persecutors are motivated by race			2
the problem is that this theory only holds up if @entity6 is being treated with a historically unique degree of hostility			1
relations between presidents and press have always been fraught			1
president @entity45 was the first @entity46 to try to cultivate journalists : he assigned them a room in the @entity50			0
but journalists who put out reports without @entity54 's consent ( so - called " @entity55 " ) were cut out of the loop , denied access to any federal department			1
incidentally , @entity45 's relations with ordinary voters were just as prickly			2
in 1912 , he was shot while giving a speech on the campaign trail			0
with admirable sangfroid , @entity54 calculated from the lack of blood that the bullet had not penetrated any organs and finished his oration , before being rushed to the nearest hospital			0
it puts @entity6 being told " you lie ! " into perspective			1
opinion : what 's behind dissing of the president ? it was @entity78 who started the formal press conference , and quickly regretted it			1
when reporters printed romantic rumors about his daughter , @entity83 , @entity78 harangued the press corps			1
" this must stop ! " he shouted			0
" on the next offense , i shall do what any other indignant father would do			0
i will punch the man who prints it on the nose			2
" @entity92 turned the press conference into the question and answer session we know today and mastered it			2
but poor @entity97 , who was used to getting 100 % respect as a soldier , found the experience as a citizen rather trying			1
at his first conference after he had declared his candidacy for the presidency in 1952 , he was shocked when , in the middle of a speech about the defenses of @entity109 , a journalist interrupted to ask , " what 's the matter with your eye ? " the general explained that he had an infection			1
at a later date , he was asked his opinion of his rival @entity117 and said , " he 's a goddam isolationist			1
" @entity97 was genuinely surprised when the remark was printed			1
things only got worse in the 1970s , when @entity122 's combative approach to the press turned @entity125 - era press conferences into a battleground			1
at a press conference on october 26 , 1973 , @entity122 complained , " i have never seen or heard such outrageous , vicious , gutter reporting in 27 years of public life			2
" addressing one reporter , he added , " yet , do n't get the impression that you rouse my anger			2
you see , one can only be angry with those he respects			0
" @entity125 changed everything : after that , presidents would shield themselves from the press and try to manage their public appearances better			2
this wiped clean the popular memory of fiery exchanges , interruptions and acid put downs that had defined the previous century			0
a new dynamic occurred , whereby there would be long periods of managed relations between press and president that gave the false impression of obeyed protocol and mutual respect			2
but then , in the midst of a crisis , all the bottled - up emotions would get released at once			2
for example , while @entity161 held 135 solitary press conferences during his time in office , @entity160 held only 46			1
the result was that when @entity160 did take questions , the journalists often let him have it			0
the most notorious occasion was november 25 , 1986 , when @entity160 held a press conference with attorney general @entity172 to discuss the @entity173			2
the president was interrupted by several reporters in the room â € ” and reporters were still shouting questions as he walked away from the microphone			0
a large part of @entity6 's problem is that he has followed the @entity160 example -- testing the patience of the press by prioritizing stage managed events ( he gave 408 interviews in his first three years , compared with @entity27 's 136 ) over question and answer sessions			1
according to political science professor @entity189 , @entity6 has held fewer press conferences for the @entity191 ( 17 ) than @entity26 ( 31 ) , @entity192 ( 56 ) , and even @entity160 ( 21 ) in the first three years			1
( @entity27 , however , held only 11 )			0
indeed , it 's notable that after his confrontation with @entity7 , @entity6 did not take questions			1
he was there to make a statement â € ” it was not a news conference -- and it is understandable that some in the press might find that frustrating			0
the bigger , more sensitive issue is the degree to which liberal supporters of the president are conflating disrespect and racism -- and so actually poisoning the political atmosphere even further			0
@entity7 's interruption was rude and he deserved all the criticism he got			1
but times are tough in @entity213 right now and when things get rough , people inevitably turn on their leaders			0
@entity6 's announcement that the administration would grant effective amnesty to 800,000 children of illegal immigrants was bound to provoke an impassioned response			1
a classier person than @entity7 might have found a better way to voice anxieties			0
but invoking " racism " as the only way to understand the righteous fury of the right sounds like an attempt to gag the opposition			0
the fact is that @entity6 is a controversial president during a difficult time in @entity213 history			1
it 's surprising that he has n't been interrupted more rudely and more often			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			2

@entity240 : @entity6 's recent interruption by @entity8 reporter *portrayed* as rude
but he says there is long history of *aggressive* questioning of presidents by press
he says @entity78 *threatened* to punch a reporter , @entity97 was asked about his eye
@entity238 : when presidents , like @entity6 , give few press conferences , pent - up press gets blunt
