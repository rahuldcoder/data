@entity10 -- @entity5 's brother , also adopted , and now a 36 - year - old family therapist -- backed his father and blamed his mother , actress @entity14			1
" my mother drummed it into me to hate my father for tearing apart the family and sexually molesting my sister , " @entity10 , 36 , told @entity20			1
" and i hated him for her for years			2

soon - @entity28 was 19 ; @entity3 was 56			2
at the time , @entity14 accused @entity3 of having molested @entity5			1

not true , @entity49 told people			1
" she never planted false memories in my brain			0
she was distraught when i told her			0
when i came forward with my story she was hoping against hope that i had made it up			0
in one of the most heartbreaking conversations i have ever had , she sat me down and asked me if i was telling the truth			0
she said that @entity132 said he did n't do anything			0
and i said , ' he 's lying			0
' " in turn , @entity10 accused his mother of having treated him badly when he was a child , @entity20 reported			1
" from an early age , my mother demanded obedience and i was often hit as a child , " he told the magazine			0
" she went into unbridled rages if we angered her , which was intimidating at the very least and often horrifying , leaving us not knowing what she would do			0
" i do n't know where he gets this about getting beaten , " she told the magazine			0
" we were sent to our rooms sometimes			0
" she described @entity10 as " dead to me , " and praised their mother			1
" my mother is so brave and so courageous and taught me what it means to be strong and brave and tell the truth even in the face of these monstrous lies			0

but she tweeted on tuesday , " i love my daughter			2
i will always protect her			0
a lot of ugliness is going to be aimed at me			0
