-- be kind to fans of " @entity3 " today			1
during the course of sunday 's episode , faithful " @entity3 " viewers had to say goodbye to @entity9 ' character , @entity8 , who was killed in a plot twist no one saw coming			1
fans have taken the news so badly that showrunners @entity15 and @entity16 have been forced to explain why they did it			1
the @entity18 , who launched the acclaimed drama in 2009 , say in an open letter addressed to their " loyal " audience that their focus has always been on " the education of " @entity27 ' character , @entity26 , a lawyer whose life was thrown into turmoil after her husband 's corruption scandal			1
over the past five seasons , @entity26 has gone from being " the good wife " to a woman rebuilding her life and career as a litigator , reuniting with her old law school friend , @entity38 , along the way			0
so when the two writers were " faced with the gut punch of @entity9 's decision , made over a year ago , to move on to other creative endeavors , we had a major choice to make			2
we could ' send him off to @entity49 , ' he could be disbarred , or get married , or go off to @entity50 to do good works , " they say of the deceased character			2
but distance would 've been but a " meager hurdle " for @entity26 and @entity38			0
" to us , there always was a tragedy at the center of @entity38 and @entity26 's relationship : the tragedy of bad timing , " the @entity18 said			1
" the brutal honesty and reality of death speaks to the truth and tragedy of bad timing for these two characters			0
" basically , this character 's death will " propel @entity26 into her newest incarnation			1
" " death also created a new dramatic ' hub ' for the show , " the @entity18 continue			1
" we 're always looking for these turning points -- some event midway through the season that will spin everybody 's lives in new directions			0
these turning points keep the show from slipping into a numbing sameness , and keep the characters fresh : because you see how they react to a completely new status quo			0
" the unexpected death they just handed down " in many ways becomes a hub for the whole series , violently spinning everybody in new directions			0
" so why did they opt to off the guy in such a gut - wrenching way ? well , the @entity18 say , " we 've all experienced the sudden death of a loved one in our lives			2
it 's terrifying how a perfectly normal and sunny day can suddenly explode with tragedy			0
@entity100 , in our opinion , does n't deal with this enough : the irredeemability of death			1
your last time with the loved one will always remain your last time			0
' @entity3 ' is a show about human behavior and emotion , and death , as sad and unfair as it can be , is a part of the human experience that we want to share			2
" in the end , the two conclude , " life does go on			0
