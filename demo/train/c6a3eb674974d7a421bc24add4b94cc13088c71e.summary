-- sadly there is nothing new about the atrocities being inflicted against civilians in the @entity5			1
what is new is the scale of the violence and widespread and arbitrary targeting of people solely because of their religion			2
@entity13 militia loyal to former president @entity14 began an offensive last week against the capital , @entity17			1
the militia attacked mosques , daubing walls with the slogan " @entity30 les musulmans " ( kill the @entity22 ) in what @entity23 describes as " a shocking escalation of @entity27 rhetoric within the @entity13 community			1
" in turn , largely @entity22 militia known as the @entity32 have killed @entity34 in their homes and attacked hospitals and churches			1
tens of thousands of @entity34 have taken refuge in churches and @entity42 missions around the country			1
some are taking shelter in hangars at the @entity17 airport			2
one missionary in @entity17 told a @entity42 charity : " we have never seen anything as bad as this before			1
we 're at the mercy of @entity52 , please pray for us			2
" @entity54 troops are trying to disarm rival groups of vigilantes before a @entity58 - style genocide can take hold			2
but the @entity5 is the size of @entity54 , and there are fewer than 2,000 of these troops currently deployed -- along with some 2,500 @entity64 peacekeepers			1
the @entity54 intervention has reduced the violence in @entity17 , but the long - term danger is that sectarian brutality will perpetuate communal hatred			1
some analysts and @entity72 officials also fear the situation may fuel a regional confrontation between @entity34 and @entity22 -- one that has already devastated northern @entity76 and is percolating in neighboring @entity77			1
according to a senior @entity72 official , the militant @entity79 group @entity78 -- which has instigated much of the @entity81 violence in @entity76 -- already has a presence in the @entity5 , where the lack of government authority , porous borders and a ready supply of weapons provide the perfect incubator for such groups			1
in most provinces , there is no police or judicial system			2
the rise of the @entity32 militia @entity22 make up 15 % of the country 's population and live mainly in the sparsely populated northeast			1
the @entity32 , the loose alliance of @entity22 militia , emerged a year ago in response to the neglect of the region as well as human rights abuses -- including rampant torture of prisoners -- by @entity14 's government			1
the @entity32 began advancing south this year , burning and looting as it went and seizing @entity17 in march			1
one leader , @entity110 , proclaimed himself president , the first head of state from the marginalized northeast			2
the @entity32 was later officially disbanded , but as many as 15,000 kept their arms and instead continued to wreak havoc in @entity17 and elsewhere			1
they mainly targeted @entity13 communities , which in turn mobilized self - defense units known as @entity120 ( literally " anti-machete			2
" ) in september , @entity121 reported that " with no checks on ( its ) power , the @entity32 rule ( operated ) arbitrarily and with complete impunity , with the government failing to follow through on its public commitment to bring to justice those responsible for recent abuses			1
" rape , summary executions , the theft of food and burning of homes were common			2
the rights group said some of the @entity32 fighters were as young as 13			1
a report by a @entity72 mission to the @entity142 in october estimated 3,500 children were among the @entity145 fighters and found " an alarming increase in inter-communal violence ... ( which ) threatens to degenerate into a country - wide religious and ethnic divide			2
" complicating the picture , many of the @entity32 are from outside the @entity5 -- from neighboring @entity152 and @entity153			1
some of the @entity153 were allegedly members of the militant @entity156 militia , which killed thousands during the conflict in @entity158 in western @entity153			2
victims of @entity32 attacks told @entity121 that their assailants often spoke @entity162			1
others in the @entity32 had no ideology or political agenda : they just wanted power and wealth			1
the @entity5 's northeast is rich in diamonds			1
like the @entity171 , the country has long suffered from the attention of outsiders wanting a slice of its natural resources : diamonds , gold , timber and ivory among them			0
it has borders with six countries and in its 53 years as an independent state has rarely seen political stability or economic growth			0
a bewildering array of rebel factions , based on ethnic and tribal affiliation or simply to serve a warlord 's ambitions , has risen and fallen			0
sectarian killing may overlap with other problems some analysts believe the fighting in the @entity5 is not about @entity197 and @entity13 , which have become labels under which people have taken shelter as the state has collapsed			1
few of the @entity32 -- or of the country 's @entity22 minority -- would likely subscribe to @entity78 's virulently anti-western message			1
@entity205 , an anthropologist who has been visiting the @entity5 for the last decade , said the sectarian killing overlaps with other grievances			1
" @entity209 relations have deteriorated for a lot of reasons : economic decline , for one , " @entity205 told @entity0			0
" the speed with which alliances are made and broken in @entity215 shows that this is largely a question of resources			2
" there is also the perception that " foreigners " control the country 's wealth , and a complete lack of trust among communities , @entity205 said			0
" this is not a case of religious extremism			0
this is a case of religion being bound up in other dividing lines in the society , " she added			0
but the current carnage , the physical separation and mutual fear of @entity34 and @entity22 , provide a fertile recruiting ground for extremists			1
the @entity72 report warned the dynamic of religious violence may spill beyond the @entity5 and be exploited by groups from outside the country			1
it said tensions between @entity22 and @entity34 " might well lead to uncontrollable sectarian violence with untold consequences for the country , the subregion and beyond			1
" that can work both ways			0
@entity251 , the @entity72 assistant secretary - general for peacekeeping , told the @entity253 this week there are indications @entity78 has some kind of presence in the country			0
@entity205 said radical @entity197 may be growing from a narrow base but said she sees no evidence of @entity78 there			0
recruiting ground for extremists militant @entity79 groups do have a growing presence elsewhere in @entity264 , from @entity265 in the north to @entity77 in the south			0
moderate @entity22 leaders in @entity77 allege that @entity78 has begun recruiting there			1
according to a @entity272 diplomatic cable published by @entity273 , @entity77 president @entity270 told the @entity272 ambassador in 2010 that he " was concerned about the threat of @entity197 extremism ( and ) beginning to worry about @entity197 extremists infiltrating @entity77 from @entity76 and making inroads through @entity77 mosques			0
" last week , @entity78 demonstrated its resilience in the face of a crackdown by @entity76 security forces with a mass attack on an air force base in the northern city of @entity287			0
@entity76 sources said several hundred men were involved and had arrived in a convoy of trucks			0
one captured fighter , paraded at a news conference , claimed that @entity78 now had men from @entity295 , @entity152 and @entity77 in its ranks			0
@entity78 has already shown it can operate beyond @entity76 , kidnapping a @entity54 priest in northern @entity77 last month			0
intelligence sources told @entity0 this year that @entity78 had trained with jihadist groups in remote areas of northern @entity301 before the @entity54 military intervention there , an assertion @entity54 foreign minister @entity304 recently repeated			0
but in the immediate future , the people of the @entity5 face far greater challenges than the infiltration by militant groups			2
@entity311 goodwill ambassador @entity310 , who has visited the country several times , said six years ago she felt its citizens were " the most abandoned people on earth			0
" their situation has worsened since then			0
even before the latest implosion , some two - thirds of its people lived below the poverty line			0
average adult life expectancy is 48 years , the second lowest in the world			0
in the past year , more than half a million have been displaced ; one in four of the population has inadequate access to food			0
the @entity72 said in the past week alone more than 70,000 people in @entity17 fled their homes			0
many have vanished into the bush beyond the reach of aid agencies			0
even if the @entity72 and nongovernmental organizations can raise funds needed to deal with the humanitarian crisis , @entity205 and others said the @entity5 faces a long , hard road to anything resembling stability			2
" in the middle and longer term , a real political project will be needed -- something that makes the country 's politics more inclusive and establishes a kind of social contract , " @entity205 said			0
" unfortunately , that is not something that international organizations are very well placed to help with			0
" she added , " we 'll really be starting from scratch , but we wo n't be starting with a clean slate			0
the long history of violent politics is inscribed in this place			0

some analysts fear fighting could fuel regional confrontation between @entity34 , @entity22
" we have never seen anything as bad as this before , " missionary says of violence
largely @entity22 militia known as the @entity32 wreaking havoc in capital and beyond
