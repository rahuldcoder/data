@entity0 , @entity1 -- with just his dream , determination and hard work , @entity3 started a solar fan business nearly a decade ago out of his garage in northwest @entity1			1
the one - time roofer simply wanted to make enough money to care for his family and to create a ripple effect for other workers , particularly in this economically depressed area outside @entity15			1
@entity3 vowed to create his solar attic fans entirely out of parts made in the @entity18			1
using only the sun 's energy , the fan pumps hot air out of the attic -- lowering cooling bills -- and does n't have to be in direct sunlight to work			0
his first year , @entity3 said he barely made enough to scrape by -- about $ 39,000 in sales			1
" it was n't enough to cover expenses , " @entity3 recalled			1
but he stuck with it and his promise to buy @entity18 parts			1
@entity3 's company , @entity32 , steadily grew to the point that he could n't keep up with the influx of orders			1
he looked around for companies that could help him manufacture the fans , concentrating his search in his own backyard			0
he eventually found a company that could help and needed the extra work about 90 miles away in @entity42 , @entity1			0
he bought molded plastic in @entity1 as well as fasteners , nuts , bolts and steel			0
wire for the fans came from workers in @entity51 , while the motors were from @entity53 and @entity15			0
even his cardboard boxes were manufactured in nearby @entity55			0
@entity3 had achieved his own small part of the @entity18 dream : he became a self - made small - business owner			1
and in 2008 , his success attracted the attention of the soon - to - be next president of the @entity18 , @entity61			1
that year , he got an unexpected call from a representative of the new administration			0
" he said he was with the @entity61 transition team looking for small companies , " @entity3 recalled			1
he later met with the man who told @entity3 , " we want to interview you , vet you			1
" " @entity72 sat right there talking with me , said ' i really love your story and i 'm going to push it up the rank , ' " @entity3 said			2
and that 's exactly what happened			0
shortly after he was inaugurated , @entity61 held a town hall meeting in the economically devastated city of @entity82 , @entity1			2
@entity3 and his wife were asked to come and -- prodded by his wife -- he stood up and told the president about his solar business			1
he asked @entity61 what he planned to do to encourage small business owners like himself			1
the question turned @entity3 into a @entity91 solar superstar			1
@entity92 , @entity93 and other media came calling to tell the story of the roofer who built a solar company out of his garage -- and he did so without a government handout			2
" move over @entity102 , " one blog headline declared after his @entity82 appearance			0
" there 's a new poster child for hard - working @entity18 -- and he 's green			2
" @entity3 's success story provided good publicity for the @entity91 which called again and again , using @entity3 to underscore the @entity61 administration 's goal of pushing @entity18 towards new sources of clean energy			1
" ' can you come to @entity112 ? can you come to @entity113 ? @entity116 doing this , ' " @entity3 said of the numerous requests he received from the administration			1
there 's the photo of him with the president and vice president @entity116 in @entity121 , another @entity1 city hard hit by the recession , as well as an appearance with sen. @entity124 of @entity125 and many others			0
@entity3 's story resonated with groups of all political stripes			2
republicans got in on the act when @entity1 sen. @entity132 named him " an energy patriot " and the @entity135 - leaning @entity18 @entity134 cited his work			2
environmentalists also contacted him , and featured him in one appearance after another			0
strange bedfellows , perhaps , but it was a feelgood story of what one @entity18 could do in a time when the recession was strangling so many			2
" they were continually inviting me to these things called ' advocacy days ' where they wanted me to meet with senators and congressmen , " @entity3 said , noting that he attended many with his wife			2
at these events , lawmakers talked about " how i created a solar product , how it 's good for the environment , for business , " he said			2
" ( @entity158 ) wo n't say they were putting words in my mouth but they had a lot of talking points , " @entity3 said			2
" i was happy to do it from that point of view			0
it is friendly to the environment ; it is creating jobs			0
" it also was good advertising for @entity3 , who could never have afforded the publicity these appearances offered			2
orders for the fans , which retail at about $ 500 , came pouring in from places as far away as @entity177			0
" it grew to where our peak was $ 2 million ( in revenues ) , " he said , referring to sales in 2009			0
@entity32 started exporting fans all over the world			2
while his home - based business employs only about 21 direct and indirect employees , it brought a much - needed economic boost to an area of the country hard hit by the recession			0
today , @entity3 's solar star appears to be on a collision course with another @entity61 policy that may put him out of business			1
the irony is not lost on @entity3 : a man whose profile and company soared because of the administration 's energy policy is now falling apart because of a new @entity61 anti-dumping policy involving @entity202			1
while 95 percent of @entity3 's fans are @entity18 - made , he has yet to find a @entity18 company that can make the small customized solar panels that make his fans run			1
it 's not that he has n't tried			0
he initially used a company in @entity209 but they stopped manufacturing the kind of panels he needed			0
then @entity3 turned to a @entity213 company but the quality was so bad that he was replacing the defective parts faster than he could sell the fans			1
over the years he begged environmental groups as well as the @entity218 for help in finding an @entity18 company that could make the key solar component			1
reluctantly , he agreed to purchase them from a major company in the @entity18 , which bought their panels from another country and then had them customized in @entity227			2
eventually that manufacturer told @entity3 to deal with the @entity227 customizer directly			2
@entity3 said the @entity18 @entity230 has accused him of using @entity202 - made solar panels , in violation of a tough import policy adopted in may at the behest of major @entity18 solar companies			1
the policy is intended to thwart @entity202 from undercutting prices and flooding the @entity18 market with cheaper solar panels			1
the @entity18 @entity218 is currently reviewing the policy , and is scheduled to make a determination in the fall			1
@entity3 denies that any of part of his solar fans are produced in @entity202 , but he admits he ca n't totally prove it			1
according to @entity3 , the owner of the @entity227 company that customizes his solar cells has stated in an affadavit that it buys the cells from the @entity18 , @entity251 and @entity252			1
but @entity3 worries that testimony wo n't be good enough			2
" the solar panel tariff is a broad - reaching tariff			0
in my estimation it should n't be geared toward small niche markets like mine , " @entity3 said			2
unless he can show specific manufacturing documentation by august 29 , @entity3 said he could be fined as much as 250 percent on his solar panels -- an effective rate of $ 270,000			1
if that anti-dumping fine is levied , @entity3 said he will have to shutter his business			1
" these guys are going to put me out of business , " @entity3 said			1
" i do n't have any help			0
i 've been trying to get help , no one can help me			0
" @entity3 said he has never received government financial assistance and is taxed in the 40 percent bracket			2
he said he has sat by and watched companies like the now bankrupt @entity275 run through taxpayers ' money and not return on the government 's investment			0
he said he does n't want a handout -- just a helping hand			0
so he went back to the well one more time , pleading with @entity282 , deputy director of the @entity283 who @entity3 said had been his contact with the @entity61 administration			1
under the subject line his e-mail to @entity282 , @entity3 wrote , " hanging on for life here			0
" " can you help me before i have to close my doors and let everyone go ? " @entity3 asked in the e-mail			0
" please ... i 'm pleading with you			0
" @entity282 responded , " thanks for bringing it to my attention			0
i do n't know what is possible , but let me talk to a few folks asap			0
" that was nearly a month ago and @entity3 is still waiting			1
@entity2 sent three e-mails to the @entity91 asking about @entity3 's situation , and received a reply from a spokesman late wednesday afternoon			0
the spokesman stated that the tariff " highlights the degree to which solar panel manufacturers have faced unfair competition from countries like @entity202 " and the president 's move to impose a tax on @entity202 - made goods is a way to establish " a level playing field with @entity202 for @entity18 businesses and workers			1
" the reply did not address @entity3 's situation			0
" when @entity61 came in office , there were a lot of small business owners who said , ' hey maybe he 'll help break barriers and help owners ' or he says he will , but it never trickles down that far to help us , " @entity3 said			1
" maybe it 's because we do n't have big budgets to donate to campaigns			0
i 'm just trying to run my company			0
" @entity330 sets goal of energy independence by 2020 @entity2 's @entity333 contributed to this story			0
