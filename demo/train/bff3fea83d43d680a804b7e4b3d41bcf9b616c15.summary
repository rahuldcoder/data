-- as you step closer to the artwork , it 's as if you 're venturing into a crimson - hued dreamscape , a psychedelic realm immersed in feverish landscapes and eerie sounds			1
yet , this is no dream			0
using a special and discontinued technology , which registers an invisible spectrum of infrared light , @entity13 artist and photographer @entity14 has captured beautiful and challenging imagery of people and landscapes in eastern @entity17			1
designed by the @entity21 military in the 1940s for camouflage detection , the @entity19 film renders the landscape in an unexpected light , turning shades of lush green into dramatic pinks and glowing reds			0
the result is both spectacular and shocking : rolling hills appear dotted with candy - coated trees ; river valleys are covered with pink savannah grasses ; gun - holding soldiers , clad in purple uniforms , stroll under darkened skies			0
set against the horrors of eastern @entity17 's humanitarian disaster , where more than five million people have died due to war - related causes since 1998 , @entity14 's surreal palette presents an alternative view of the region 's complex situation			1
read this : why the world ignores @entity17 conflict it 's this juxtaposition of alluring panoramas and defiant militia , of haunting beauty and unsettling violence , that forces viewers to pause and think			2
" the idea was to use this medium to see into the unseen , to reveal the hidden and make visible the invisible of this forgotten conflict , " says @entity14 , 33			2
" that works really on a very simple level through the color palette , " he adds			0
" the pink is so surprising and shocking and unnatural that really makes people stop			0
" @entity14 first used infrared film in his highly praised 2011 photographic series " @entity65 , " also about eastern @entity17			1
he now takes that project a step further with " @entity68 , " a multimedia installation that opened last weekend at the @entity70 of the @entity71 in @entity72			1
" @entity68 " is centred on a six - screen projection of a nearly 40 - minute documentary , shot on 16mm infrared film			2
throughout large parts of last year , @entity14 traveled across eastern @entity17 with cinematographer @entity77 and composer @entity78			1
embedded with armed militia , they captured video , stills and audio to create a powerful installation about the region 's rebel groups and their surrounding communities			1
" there 's no plot , there 's no narrator , there 's no dialogue -- it 's very much a video art piece , " says @entity14 , who first travelled to eastern @entity17 in 2010			1
@entity95 reporter : ' my camera is my weapon ' " throughout , the camera it 's very much a documentary work , " says @entity14			2
" it is unscripted ; we just really go into the warzone and it comes to us			0
we ca n't really make things up ; it 's really what we had the luck to capture and what we turned our sights on			0
" @entity14 says that at the heart of the project is an effort to bring " two counter-worlds into collision : art 's potential to represent narratives so painful that they exist beyond language , and photography 's capacity to document specific tragedies and communicate them to the world			0
" " @entity68 " is exhibited at @entity126 in @entity127 until november 24 .			0
