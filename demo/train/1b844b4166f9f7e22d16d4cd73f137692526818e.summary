-- we 're in the throes of summer vacation season , but at least one @entity4 is still on the job			1
while it 's rumored that president @entity8 will follow in the footsteps of president @entity10 and vacation on @entity12 , he has n't had a chance to break out his @entity15 shorts just yet			1
when @entity8 does take off , though , he 'll join in the grand tradition of presidential vacations , like these notable ones : president @entity20 ( r ) and @entity22 prime minister @entity21 ride bikes in @entity23 , @entity24 , in 2008			1
@entity25 does n't go too far far - flung vacations are nice , but president @entity25 preferred to stay a bit closer to home			1
when @entity25 needed a getaway from the heat and political turmoil of @entity34 - era @entity29 , he headed to ... a different part of @entity29 from 1862 to 1864 @entity25 spent june through november living in a cottage atop a hill at the @entity38 a few miles from the @entity39			1
@entity25 apparently loved the slight change of scenery , which meant slightly cooler temperatures and a chance to ride his horse each morning			1
if you 're considering a stay - cation this year , consider this @entity25 's endorsement			1
movie cowboy does real ranching think @entity20 was the first president to sneak away from the @entity39 to spend time on his ranch ? not quite			1
at the end of his second term as @entity57 in 1974 , @entity54 paid just over half a million dollars to acquire @entity58 in @entity60 's @entity59			1
the 688 - acre ranch , complete with stables and a 1500 - square - foot adobe house , was @entity54 's go - to vacation destination while he was in office , and he entertained some big names there , including @entity68 , @entity69 , and @entity70 , who gamely wore a cowboy hat during his visit			1
@entity73 does some ranching , too texan @entity73 was very involved in the everyday operations of his ranch			2
@entity73 , who had gotten into ranching in 1951 , grew his @entity78 into a 2,700 - acre spread populated by 400 head of @entity82 cattle			2
@entity73 was no absentee owner when he was in @entity29 , either			2
@entity73 frequently headed back on vacations and supposedly drove his foreman crazy by calling every day to talk about the weather on the ranch or how the pastures looked			1
today , the @entity88 maintains @entity73 's spread as a working ranch , complete with a herd of cattle descended from the @entity93 bred			1
@entity20 initiates a war on brush @entity20 followed in @entity73 's footsteps and went to his own @entity24 ranch when he needed a getaway			1
@entity99 , a 1,583 - acre spread @entity20 owns near @entity23 , @entity24 , served as the secondary @entity39 throughout @entity20 's presidency , and he was often shown clearing brush during vacations			1
@entity20 was n't just doing farm work , though			2
he exhorted visitors to join the " president 's @entity108 " by running three miles or biking 10 after the mercury hit 100 degrees			2
anyone who could pull of the feat got a specialized @entity113 shirt as recognition			0
we can only hope one of the many foreign dignitaries @entity20 entertained at the ranch -- including @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , and @entity124 @entity123 -- managed to get one of the coveted shirts into their suitcases			2
@entity0 : @entity128 , @entity129 and other extreme vacation spots 5			0
@entity131 heats up @entity132 some presidents choose to head to their hometowns or a beach side resort for their vacations , but @entity131 preferred to travel to western @entity132			2
@entity137 , @entity132 , is the home of ( you guessed it ! ) warm springs that supposedly had therapeutic value for polio sufferers			0
@entity131 , who had contracted his own paralytic illness in 1921 , started visiting @entity137 in 1924 in the hope that exercising in the springs ' warm waters would cure him			0
although the springs did n't reverse his illness , @entity131 felt like his time at the resort alleviated his symptoms somewhat			0
in 1927 he bought the resort he 'd been staying at , and in 1932 he ordered a six - room @entity132 pine house to be built on the property			0
this house was @entity131 's retreat throughout his presidency and became known as the @entity158			0
@entity131 was sitting for a portrait at the @entity158 when he died of a stroke in april 1945			0
today , the house is part of @entity132 's state park system and is open to visitors ; it 's been preserved to look almost exactly as it did the day @entity131 died			0
@entity166 gets the right ice cubes when @entity166 wanted a break from @entity29 , he headed to a modest ranch home he owned on @entity170 off @entity171			1
@entity166 's " @entity176 @entity39 , " which he visited 50 - plus times during his tenure in office , eventually swelled to include three houses and a floating helipad , which the @entity174 installed at a taxpayer expense of $ 400,000			1
( there was plenty of room for taxpayer outrage at the $ 625,000 total the government spent sprucing up the @entity176 @entity39 ; one itemized expense was $ 621 for a replacement icemaker because " the president does not like ice with holes in it			1
" ) given that this house was @entity166 's retreat , it 's no surprise that some shady dealings transpired on the premises			1
@entity166 allegedly discussed plans for the @entity197 break - in at the house , and he holed up there when the coverup came to light			2
the house fell into disrepair after @entity166 sold it , and in 2004 it was razed to make room for a new building			2
the @entity176 @entity39 was n't @entity166 's only retreat , though			1
he bought a mansion overlooking the @entity209 in @entity210 , @entity60 , shortly after taking office in 1969			0
@entity166 dubbed his new digs " @entity213 , " but the press quickly started referring to the spread as " the @entity216 @entity39			1
" this house was n't cheap for taxpayers , either ; the government dropped over a million dollars improving this home with temporary office quarters for staffers , helipads , and an upgraded heating system			2
@entity0 : @entity225 and other memorable presidential siblings 7			0
@entity227 goes bear hunting lounging on the beach is great , but do you really think @entity227 would miss the opportunity to do something manly ? @entity131 's vacation in 1905 took him to the @entity234 in @entity235 , @entity234 , where he stayed for three weeks while bear hunting			0
@entity131 's successor gets his own little @entity39 @entity238 may have been from @entity239 , but he headed south when he needed some r&r			1
@entity238 started suffering from exhaustion in late 1946 , and his physicians recommended a warm weather vacation to revitalize the president			0
@entity238 took his vacation in a converted duplex in @entity247 that already held some history			0
the house , which was originally built in 1890 for the commandant and paymaster of @entity247 's naval base , had already hosted @entity253 while he was in office in 1912			0
when @entity255 developed 41 new weapons to aid in the @entity4 efforts in @entity258 , he spent six months living in the house			1
once @entity238 visited the house , though , it quickly became known as @entity238 's @entity158			2
he ended up spending 175 days in @entity247 over the course of his two terms in office			0
presidents @entity265 and @entity266 later used the house while they were in office , and it 's now open as a tourist attraction			2
@entity0 : early summer jobs of @entity238 , @entity73 and more 9			0
@entity266 retreats to his compound starting in 1926 , @entity266 began taking his family to @entity275 , @entity276 , on vacation each summer			0
his son @entity278 liked the area so much that in 1956 he bought a cottage of his own near his parents ' digs , and the family soon purchased a third cottage in the area , giving rise to the name " the @entity288			0
" @entity289 used his cottage as a base of operations for his presidential campaign and later vacationed there each summer he was in office			0
@entity296 prefers not to ranch not to be outdone by the @entity299 , the @entity20 family has an even older compound of their own in @entity303 , @entity304			0
in 1903 @entity305 , the grandfather of @entity296 , built a great mansion on his oceanfront estate in @entity303 , and the property has remained in the family ever since			0
@entity296 used the @entity303 compound as his vacation home during his presidency , and @entity20 made a few getaways to the house as well			1
between father and son , they 've entertained some pretty big names at their summer house , including @entity320 , @entity119 , and @entity321			0
