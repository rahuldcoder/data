-- we are not living up to the promise of the @entity3			2
even now , our leaders are talking about cutting , instead of creating jobs to grow our way out of the deficit			0
@entity9 is ignoring big problems , congratulating itself on avoiding a fiscal cliff of its own creation			0
the federal budget props up broken parts of our economic system -- big banks , big polluters and big defense contractors -- instead of investing in areas such as education and infrastructure that would benefit everyone			0
now , a new breed of companies is leveraging the power of networks and sharing -- and showing us what a more sustainable , prosperous future can look like			1
one of the most well - known examples is @entity31			1
its tagline , " wheels when you want them , " pretty much sums up the company			0
@entity31 was just bought by rental giant @entity38 for nearly $ 500 million as part of @entity38 ' push to compete with @entity41 's and @entity43 's new car - sharing services			1
the demographics of car - sharing customers holds promise for future growth as younger , tech - savvy consumers tend to prefer sharing services			1
then there is @entity51 , a new addition to the share economy			1
@entity51 just launched the first online clean energy investment marketplace			0
( full disclosure : i am an uncompensated adviser to the company			0
) here 's how it works : @entity51 connects investors to solar projects in need of financing			0
the projects generate revenue by selling the electricity they generate , which allows the investors to get paid back with interest			0
through the company , you can pick a solar project that you like , make an investment for as little as $ 25 and get returns starting at 4.5 % annually			0
of course , as with nearly any investment that is n't federally insured , there 's a risk involved			0
instead of earning close to nothing on your money at a bank , you can directly invest in things that offer solid returns and create real or lasting value			0
together , consumers can start rebuilding the economy from the community up			1
together , we can crowdsource investments in @entity90 infrastructure and create 21st - century energy jobs all by ourselves			1
the mega-banks that financed the fossil fuel era are n't well matched to the emerging clean energy economy , which is more decentralized			1
there are enough rooftops in @entity97 alone to create 5 gigawatts of clean power			2
instead of two mega coal plants , the energy could come from hundreds of thousands of people , all making money by selling energy from their roofs and contributing to a more sustainable and resilient energy grid			1
@entity108 's @entity107 made news last week with its investment of more than $ 2 billion in two solar power plants in @entity112			2
but you know who has more money than even @entity108 ? all of us combined			0
all of us who are looking to invest responsibly and grow clean energy are a powerful force for change			0
in some cities , the demand for car - sharing services is so great that people are renting out their personal cars through services such as @entity127 and @entity128			1
@entity130 's @entity129 aims to be the @entity31 of electric scooters			0
services such as @entity133 and @entity134 allow people to rent their homes or rooms to strangers vetted by their peers			1
through @entity141 and @entity142 , anyone can hire a personal assistant to run errands or complete more complex tasks such as accounting for your small business			0
these sharing services are proving that sharing is n't just for the do - gooders anymore -- it can make you real money			1
airbnb hosts make an average of $ 6,000 per year for renting out their homes			0
people who loan cars through @entity159 generally make enough to cover their monthly car payments			2
and a few people are making $ 5,000 per month just from completing tasks through @entity141			2
a few months after the @entity165 campaign launched in 2011 , and on the heels of a controversy surrounding debit card fees , more than 650,000 people turned to opening credit union accounts			2
today , environmentalists such as @entity171 and his 350.org are leading the charge for divesting from big polluters			0
the opportunity for people - driven , shareable , sustainable business does n't stop with solar or transportation projects			1
we can invest in @entity90 businesses that power our country with all kinds of innovative technologies such as wind turbines , solar panels , geothermal systems , hybrid and electric cars , and next - generation batteries			1
and we should put @entity90 to work making our homes and buildings energy - efficient			2
we need to avoid a lost generation of young people who will be playing economic catch - up their whole lives			1
we can not stop pressing our leaders to help struggling poor and middle - class @entity90			2
but we can never forget that together , we are a tremendous force for change			0
as we call on @entity200 to act , we can also call on each other to create jobs and spark the clean - energy economy of the future -- an economy that works for everyone			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			1
