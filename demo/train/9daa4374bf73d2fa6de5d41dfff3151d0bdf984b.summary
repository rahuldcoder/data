@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 president @entity3 condemned photos of @entity6 soldiers posing with bodies of suspected insurgents as he called thursday for " an accelerated and full transition of security responsibilities to @entity1 forces			1
" @entity3 , who described the images as " inhumane and provocative , " said " the only way to put an end to such painful experiences " was to end the presence of foreign forces in @entity1			1
" it is such a disgusting act to take photos with body parts and then share it with others , " he added			1
@entity6 defense secretary @entity22 has also condemned the photos , reportedly taken in 2010 and published wednesday by the @entity24 , saying they depict behavior that " absolutely violates " @entity6 regulations and values			2
a military investigation is under way			0
the photographs are the latest strain on tense @entity6 - @entity1 relations following a string of incidents that have plagued the @entity6 military in @entity1 this year			1
a massacre of villagers in march , allegedly by a @entity6 soldier , led @entity3 to demand that foreign troops withdraw from @entity1 villages and return to their larger bases			1
in a statement thursday , the @entity43 said what the photos show is typical of what the @entity6 stands for			1
" in the last 11 years since the @entity6 invaded @entity1 , they have repeatedly done inhumane things which are not acceptable to anyone in the world , " the @entity43 said			2
the images ' publication has not sparked the kind of public anger seen in @entity1 after @entity57 personnel at @entity58 improperly disposed of @entity60 religious materials , including @entity61 , by burning them in what @entity6 officials described as an unintentional error			2
that incident prompted deadly riots and fatal attacks on @entity6 troops			2
@entity70 secretary - general @entity69 said wednesday the images " do n't in anyway represent the principles and values that are the basis for our mission in @entity1			2
" he added that he considers the photos " an isolated event			0
" the two photos published by the paper are among 18 provided by a @entity6 soldier who wanted " to draw attention to the safety risk of a breakdown in leadership and discipline , " the @entity24 reported			2
one shows a member of the @entity6 military in front of what appears to be the body of an insurgent			1
the photo shows the insurgent 's head , with his eyes open and what may be his hand on the @entity6 soldier 's shoulder			0
another soldier appears to be looking down at the body , reaching his hand into the blanket covering it			0
the second photo shows a group of people , including some @entity6 soldiers , standing with what appear to be legs from a corpse			1
one @entity6 soldier is smiling and giving a double thumbs - up , and another is also smiling at the camera			0
there appear to be @entity1 police in that photo as well			0
@entity2 has not authenticated the images			0
national security and military experts warned on @entity2 wednesday that the photos ' release could only add to the difficulty and danger of the international mission in @entity1			1
" it 's incidents like these which are dividing @entity6 troops from the @entity1			2
i just do n't see it getting better , " said @entity129 , a former @entity130 agent who spent most of his career in the @entity132			0
@entity134 , a retired @entity6 army general who now works as a consultant in @entity136 , said the controversy was " very damaging to all the @entity6 efforts , specifically the @entity6 effort to assure it stays in harness with the @entity1 government and the @entity1 security forces " as they move forward in their mission			1
and retired gen. @entity145 , a former @entity70 supreme allied commander , said the photos do n't represent " the standards or the training or the values of the @entity6 armed forces " but will add to the sense of loss and hatred built up in @entity1 during long decades of conflict			1
the images ' release is the latest in @entity6 military setbacks this year in @entity1			1
in january , a video posted on a website showed four @entity6 @entity160 urinating on enemy corpses			0
in the march attack , @entity163 staff sgt. @entity162 allegedly left a remote outpost in @entity168 's @entity167 district and went house to house , gunning down villagers			0
he has been charged with 17 counts of murder in the shooting rampage			0
the attack intensified a debate about whether to pull @entity6 troops ahead of their planned 2014 withdrawal			0
@entity2 's @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 contributed to this report .			0
