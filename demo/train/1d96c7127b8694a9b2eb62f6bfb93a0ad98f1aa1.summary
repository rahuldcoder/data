-- president @entity1 is poised to make his case to the country on the next steps for tackling the threat posed by @entity6			1
certainly , @entity6 ' advances this summer -- including the seizure of territories in @entity10 and @entity11 , declaration of a new " caliphate , " and its killings of thousands in @entity10 and @entity11 , including two @entity16 journalists -- have been a wake - up call			2
what should the president keep in mind as he prepares to deliver his speech wednesday ? here are five key questions he should answer in his speech and as he follows up in the coming weeks : what metrics will the @entity16 use to gauge the success of airstrikes in @entity10 and possible additional strikes in @entity11 ? since early august , the @entity16 has conducted targeted airstrikes inside @entity10 territory -- all with the aims of deterring further advances by @entity6 , protecting @entity16 personnel in @entity10 , preventing instances of genocide and preventing @entity6 ' control of key assets , including dams			1
in recent days , the @entity16 has widened the geographic areas where it has conducted strikes in @entity10			0
with some steps forward on forming a new @entity10 government in @entity41 , the @entity16 may be positioned to conduct even more strikes inside @entity10 , because the @entity1 administration has made the formation of a more inclusive government a condition for additional security assistance			1
furthermore , the @entity1 administration is reportedly contemplating strikes inside @entity11 territory -- where @entity51 affiliate @entity50 , as well as @entity6 , poses a threat to regional stability			1
at some point soon , the @entity16 needs to develop a clearly defined set of objectives linked to the ongoing and possible additional airstrikes to allow it to measure the impact of its strikes			2
how will president @entity1 manage the international and regional coalitions he seeks to build against @entity6 ? during the past week , the @entity1 administration has talked a lot about the need to build a broad international and regional coalition against @entity6			1
it took some steps at the @entity71 summit			0
secretary of defense @entity72 went to @entity74 this week to talk next steps , and secretary of state @entity76 is in the @entity77 trying to build a regional coalition			0
these ministerial - level meetings are important to set a framework , but if the @entity1 administration is serious about building a coalition , it will need multiple levels of coordination and engagement with partners beneath the level of the secretaries of state and defense			1
it needs to be an intense , ongoing effort			0
as we 've seen in places like @entity97 recently , coalitions wrought with major internal divisions tend to fall apart -- with sometimes disastrous results -- as outlined in a recent report			2
there is n't just a @entity102 divide between @entity103 and @entity104 , but also a new @entity105 between leading @entity102 states in the region			0
what are the contingency plans if @entity10 does not make additional progress in forming an inclusive , cross-sectarian response to @entity6 ? @entity10 's leaders took an important step this week in forming a more inclusive government , but this government still lacks leaders for two key security ministries : defense and interior			2
and even if the government formation process is completed soon , it may be unclear for years whether the government in @entity41 will rule inclusively and accommodate the interests of the country 's @entity102 minority and the @entity126 , who have increased their autonomy in recent months			0
@entity16 policy is wisely conditioned on trying to use the leverage of @entity16 assistance to @entity10 as an incentive to bring @entity10 's diverse political factions together , but there is always the possibility that this might come apart			0
incidents like the massacre of @entity138 last month by @entity102 militias could happen at any moment , and the question for @entity16 policymakers is what the fallback plan should be if @entity10 's leaders do not bring together a cohesive government			0
what is the new plan for supporting @entity11 's third way opposition forces to counter @entity6 and the @entity150 regime ? it looks like president @entity1 is poised to redouble @entity16 efforts to support @entity11 opposition forces fighting @entity6 , the regime of @entity11 president @entity156 , as well as the @entity51 affiliate @entity50			1
@entity1 proposed an additional $ 500 million of assistance in june , and any strategy to deal with @entity6 in @entity11 is going to need some forces on the ground willing to work as part of an expanded campaign there			1
the key question the administration will need to answer is whether it has learned from the past few years of failed efforts to strengthen the @entity11 opposition ; multiple actors in the region have offered many forms of assistance to different factions of the @entity11 opposition , and yet it is today weak and beleaguered			0
additional money and weapons might help , but could also be squandered without a broader coordination strategy			0
how can the international and regional coalition more effectively address the massive humanitarian crisis in @entity11 , @entity10 and neighboring countries ? an estimated 3 million @entity11 are now refugees in neighboring countries , and an additional 6.5 million are displaced inside @entity11			0
inside of @entity10 , millions have been displaced by the multiple waves of conflict inside the country , including the most recent conflict in northern @entity10 with @entity6			2
additional military actions by actors in the region and possible expanded @entity16 strikes would have an impact on this already disastrous humanitarian situation			0
president @entity1 appears ready to engage in a more expansive strategy to deal with the problem posed by @entity6 , and his speech will try to outline the multifaceted nature of his approach			1
but as we have learned from other speeches by president @entity1 , the key test will come in how well his administration actually follows up on the implementation of its stated policy			1
@entity1 meets with congressional leaders on @entity6 strategy @entity0 poll finds majority of @entity16 alarmed by @entity6			1

president @entity1 is set to outline his strategy to counter @entity6 on wednesday
@entity1 should outline how exactly he will gauge success , say @entity211
building lasting coalitions will be essential , @entity211 writes
@entity211 : administration should make clear what support it will offer forces opposing @entity6
