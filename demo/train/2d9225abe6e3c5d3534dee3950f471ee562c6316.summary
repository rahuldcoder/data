-- for the 20 million residents of @entity2 , air pollution -- and the lack of official information about it -- is a constant concern			1
until recently , eye - watering smog was the only reliable sign that car fumes and smoke had reached unsafe levels , but now two young designers have come up with a more elegant and accurate indicator of air quality			1
@entity16 worked with @entity17 , a fellow design student , to develop the concept of @entity2 , a network of air - quality monitors fixed to the kites traditionally flown across the city			1
lights controlled by @entity24 and trailing along the kite string like fireflies would give a simple readout of pollution levels : green for safe and red for danger			1
kites flying has a long history in @entity2 , which helped @entity16 and @entity17 to get local residents involved in the project -- something that they considered crucial to its success			1
they organized a series of workshops at which people could modify their own kites , turning them into mobile air - quality monitors			1
" at first we were really worried no local citizens would show up to any of the workshops , that it might just be university students or expats who already have access to things like @entity54 , " @entity16 says -- but they were amazed at how many elderly people joined in			1
" they were incredibly excited and it tapped into their ( sense of ) youthful activism , and they started telling neighbors , bringing their grandchildren to the events			2
" read this : tiny computer takes prize at design awards @entity16 said that the workshops also helped break down barriers between the kite fliers and the equipment they were working with			1
" it was not just about putting technology into a black box or having people buy modules that they could read data off , " she said			2
" it was really allowing people to see how ( the sensors ) functioned and therefore develop a relationship to the technology			0
" the sensors used for the project measure carbon monoxide , ozone and general particulates			0
@entity17 acknowledges that the traffic - light readouts provide a ballpark guide to pollution levels rather than specific quantitative data , and that some critics and supporters have suggested they adopt a more rigorous approach			1
in response , she says that the simplicity of the data is one of its strengths			0
" we did n't just collect the data and put it on a spreadsheet online , " she says			0
" we displayed it in a way that was really intuitive			0
everyone understood that different colors mean different pollution levels and just the activity of kite flying itself was also a really exciting way to distribute information			1
" designers often start with a small - scale solution to a big problem , according to @entity118			2
he is a member of the jury for the index : awards -- held last week , and for which float was nominated -- and a partner at @entity125 , a consultancy that advises people trying to tackle social and environmental challenges			0
" they start by sketching out an idea , followed by building prototypes that can then be tested with early users , " he said			0
" the feedback received can then be used to further improve the product			0
@entity123 is at that early stage			0
" for float to have the maximum impact , it must succeed in creating a larger demand for its product and get it to the buyer			0
the hope is that @entity123 receives more attention now through the nomination , which in turn helps the designers to attract partners that can help develop the product further , mass - produce and distribute it			2
" one recent upgrade the designers have made is to add a gps locator and a memory card to the sensor , so the kite fliers will now be able to record pollution readings over time and plot them on maps of the city			1
the intention is that these pollution maps should be open source , so that anyone in the city can analyze or add to the data			2
" we 're really interested in the more political aspects of data , " @entity17 says			0
" what we 're really interested in is finding a way to distribute intelligence as opposed to just information , and empowering people to interpret the data			0

a pair of young designers have created kites that monitor @entity2 *'s* air quality
lights on the kite string would give a simple readout of pollution levels
kites ' rich history in @entity2 made it easier to get local residents ' support
