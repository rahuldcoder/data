-- when @entity3 lines up at @entity4 , @entity5 , on sunday in front of an anticipated crowd of 30,000 , the @entity2 wonder horse will carry the weight not only of jockey @entity9 but the expectations of an entire nation			1
the superstar mare will be bidding for her 20th win from 20 races			1
if she succeeds , she will have gone one better than the great @entity18 , who faltered at the 20th attempt			2
@entity3 has already overhauled the marks of such racing legends as @entity22 ( undefeated in 18 races ) and @entity24 ( 14 )			2
indeed , one has to go all the way back to @entity26 , a 19th century @entity28 racehorse , to find a more impressive streak ( although her barely creditable record of 54 wins and no defeats seems safe for the time being )			0
the @entity3 phenomenon has gripped a sports - mad @entity2 public			1
of the capacity crowd expected to turn out on sunday , a good proportion will be wearing her trademark salmon and black silks			0
the appetite for all things @entity3 is so great that the state government has arranged free public transport for all those heading to the track			0
she will face only a small number of rivals on sunday			0
such is the aura of invincibility surrounding @entity3 , she typically races against just a handful of other runners			2
she is currently being quoted by some bookmakers at odds of 1 - 20 ( and no , that 's not a misprint ) for the @entity59 clash , ahead of last year 's @entity61 winner @entity62 at 14 - 1			0
but despite having beaten the best @entity2 racehorses of her generation -- including @entity66 and @entity67 , both classy runners in their own right -- @entity3 remains unproven on the global stage			1
that is set to change , however			0
in june , @entity3 will get the chance to test herself against the best in the world when she travels to @entity76 for the @entity77 at @entity78			0
for @entity2 , @entity3 's @entity76 endeavor is something of a national cause			1
but if she has little left to prove to an adoring public back home , a question mark remains over @entity3 's claims to greatness on the world stage , and that question mark comes in the not - insubstantial shape of a four - year - old bay colt called @entity92			2
the only horse in the world with a higher rating than @entity3 , the inevitable clamor for a showdown between the two best horses in the world is likely to reach deafening pitch should @entity3 win again on sunday			1
a match race seems unlikely since the two horses prefer to race over different distances : sprints of 1,000 -1,200 meters for @entity3 ; the mile and upwards for @entity92			0
that has n't prevented billionaire owner @entity107 from sponsoring a Â £ 1 million purse should the two horses line up for the @entity109 at @entity110 in august			0
it would mean a step up in trip for @entity3 to the mile , over undulating ground that is likely to favor the defending champion @entity92 with his huge , all - devouring stride			1
but with 20 million @entity2 backing her every furlong of the way , you would n't bet against her			1
comparing champions : @entity3 vs. @entity18 the similarities between the two great race mares are evident			2
both horses are huge ( @entity3 stands at 16.2 @entity126 while @entity18 stood at a carthorse - like 17.2 @entity126 ) , and their hulking frames meant they were each only lightly raced in their early years ( larger horses usually take longer to develop )			1
@entity18 became a racing -- and sporting -- phenomenon in @entity132 , finishing runner - up twice in the @entity134 's @entity136 award ( once to @entity137 and once to @entity138 )			1
@entity3 's following in @entity2 is so huge that @entity140 interrupted the @entity142 tennis semifinal between @entity143 and @entity144 to televise one of her races			1
@entity18 was named after the album " @entity156 " by @entity150 band the police , who were signed to the record label of her owner , @entity154			0
@entity3 was named by one of her owners , @entity157 , who has a taste for the delicacy			0
it also refers back to the mare 's grandmother , @entity162 .			0

superstar mare @entity3 will make *history* if she wins at @entity4
the @entity2 horse is bidding for her 20th win from 20 races
if *successful* , she will beat @entity132 *thoroughbred* @entity18
sports - mad @entity2 crowd will be backing *homegrown* champion
