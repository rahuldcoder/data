@entity4 , @entity5 , @entity10 capt. @entity9 revealed at a news conference monday that evidence extracted from the wrecked 2005 @entity1 ' data recorder showed no indication of brake compression as the car headed toward a stone wall			1
rather , the accelerator was pressed 100 percent , authorities said			0

" there 's no possibility of any distortion of this data , " he continued			2

" a housekeeper was driving the car at the time of the accident			0
she told police the vehicle accelerated on its own as she eased forward down her employer 's driveway , causing her to crash into a stone wall on the other side of the road			2
the incident , which did not involve other vehicles nor injuries to anyone , drew attention because the @entity48 was part of @entity1 's november recall to address the risk of pedal entrapment in the floor mat. but police said early on that floor mats were not a factor in this accident			1
a recall to address a sticky accelerator problem did not include the @entity48			0

" we do see these accidents on occasion , " @entity9 said monday			0
" i think with all this hype about @entity1 , people are just looking to point fingers , " he said			1
