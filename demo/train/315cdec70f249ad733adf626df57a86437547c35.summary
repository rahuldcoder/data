-- while @entity3 's economy continues to falter , lawmakers are betting big that the casino industry can swoop in and lift it out of the doldrums			1
gambling is currently illegal in @entity3 , though many play pachinko , a quintessentially @entity3 game often likened to pinball			1
while cash prizes are forbidden , many pachinko parlors work on a gray economy where prizes are exchanged -- off - premises -- for hard currency			2
this week , a major conference focusing on the future of the industry opened in @entity19			1
it comes at a time when key legislation is being pushed through @entity3 's parliament that could pave the way for the development of a large - scale gaming industry in the country			1
" there is ample chance that the bill will be debated in parliament ( this session ) and will be passed by both houses , " said @entity28 , director of the @entity29 , @entity30 and a key speaker at this week 's @entity32			2
@entity19 , along with @entity3 's second city , @entity40 , is being eyed as a key destination for so - called " @entity42 " ( @entity42 ) , which would combine casinos with hotel , luxury retail and entertainment complexes			1
the industry has the potential to generate tens of billions of dollars for @entity3 , attracting massive investment from overseas -- in particular from @entity52 - based companies and @entity54 gaming operators -- and boosting its tourism numbers			1
the next @entity56 ? " the easy comparison to make is with the @entity56 market , " said @entity57 at @entity58			0
" the success of the @entity56 market and its ability to generate non-gaming revenues , much more so than the @entity65 market			0
that is a lot easier to sell politically			0
tourism creates the meetings , incentives and retail			0
everything else that comes with it aside from gambling			2
" part of the urgency in getting the legislation ratified in this diet session comes from the desire to keep the gaming project concurrent with the opening of the @entity83 in 2020			0
" the government is looking at the @entity88 and @entity42 as a one - two in terms of elevating @entity3 's tourism presence and then really going after foreign inbound visitors , " @entity84 , principal and analyst at @entity86 , told @entity0			1
" inbound foreign visitation is fairly anemic on an annual basis for such a developed and interesting country			0
i think that 's the key there			0
it has nothing to do with economics -- using @entity101 as a means to help fund @entity88 development			0
" with casinos opening up across @entity54 , from new developments in @entity107 and the @entity108 to @entity109 , @entity56 and @entity111 's gambling mecca @entity65 , eyes are firmly fixed on this side of the world for the industry 's expansion			1
@entity3 is seen as a huge untapped market and one which , unlike @entity65 for example , would not be heavily reliant on inbound tourism to fulfill its potential			1
homegrown crowd much of the investment interest is pegged on @entity3 gamblers flocking to their own casinos -- @entity28 suggests that upwards of 80 % of @entity3 casinos visitors could be locals , and this stable , relatively disposable income - rich market is certainly a selling point , as it is likely that the region 's biggest gambling market may choose to shun @entity3 casinos			1
historical and cultural tensions between @entity111 and @entity3 -- @entity3 aggression during the @entity134 remains a highly political issue across much of @entity54 -- may dampen @entity111 enthusiasm for @entity3 travel			1
" we will not be too dependent on @entity111 , like @entity65 , " said @entity28			0
" given the political relationship , there is a potential risk ( if @entity3 casinos were too dependent on @entity143 visitors )			1
" the strength of the domestic market could have a knock - on effect to other gaming destinations in the region , particularly @entity109 , which could see a drop - off in @entity3 gamblers traveling overseas			1
untapped potential the interest from casino companies -- @entity52 - based companies like @entity155 but also @entity54 operators -- is palpable			0
the bidding process , which will begin if and when the law is passed , will lead to potentially the most expensive resorts ever built , with some figures suggesting anything up to a $ 10 billion investment			0
the numbers involved in @entity3 are much higher than they are elsewhere in @entity54 , largely due to the high price of land			2
nonetheless , the opportunity to break into a new market is seemingly too tempting to resist			0
" it will be highly sought after from all the major global players , as ( potentially ) the second - largest market in @entity54 , from a gaming revenue point , " said @entity170			2
given potentially low returns , thanks to eyewatering capital expenditure including land and construction costs and higher wages , along with a potentially more punitive tax climate than neighboring countries , the risk that gaming operations are taking on appear to be higher			0
" you 're going to have to spend a lot more money to get the same amount of casino , it is not clear that the return profile will be as good as @entity65 or @entity56 , but it could very well be , " said @entity84			0
@entity190 threatened ? analysts are divided on whether the influx of gaming tables will affect the pachinko industry , which has seen the development of thousands of parlors dotted across the country			2
regardless , the ruling @entity198 -- along with a handy majority of cross-party support -- sees the arrival of legalized gambling in @entity3 as a boon for the country 's coffers			1
" clearly , there can be a significant economic stimulus associated with the development of @entity42 , " said @entity84			0
" from a taxing and jobs perspective , it could meaningful for @entity3			2

@entity3 's ruling party hopes to legalize gambling within the month
ruling could pave the way for huge *integrated* resorts in @entity3 's major cities
advocates say the *liberalization* of the gaming industry will help @entity3 's ailing economy
