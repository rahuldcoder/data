-- four years ago , @entity1 walked into @entity3 's tattoo shop , mournful and anxious			1
her brother had just died of leukemia , and she wanted something to remember him by			1
she 'd gone to other tattoo shops in the @entity9 area and when she tried to explain her story -- why she was getting her first tattoo at age 37 , what it meant to her -- it felt like no one listened			1
they told her to flip through a book and pick a drawing she liked ; it just did n't feel right			0
" this was a very personal piece for me			0
i needed that work of art , " @entity1 said			0
she had heard about @entity23 's shop , @entity25 's @entity24 in @entity26 , @entity27 , and decided to stop by			1
she told @entity23 that her brother died at age 45 , and she wanted to honor him in some way			1
@entity30 left @entity23 's shop with a pinstripe tattoo adorned with the initials of her children and a picture of a heart glass her brother gave her before he passed away			1
it was exactly what she wanted			1
" she had that sensitivity to that reason why most people get tattoos			1
it is a very secret and spiritual experience , " @entity1 said			0
it 's the kind of experience on which @entity23 built her business -- a family - friendly tattoo shop she opened five years ago , hoping it would feel welcoming to everybody			1
" i wanted to take the smut and drama out of the image of a tattoo shop , " said @entity23 , 42			1
" i have children , and i did n't want to be embarrassed to bring my kids into my shop			1
" but @entity23 's entrance into the tattooing world did n't start off easy			1
long before @entity23 started dabbling with needles and inks , she managed a call center with more than 180 employees			0
the single mother of three teens rose quickly at her company , but when the travel industry hit a slump , jobs were cut left and right			1
after sleepless nights and stressful days of hoping she would stay employed , she found herself being escorted out of her building with her belongings packed in a cardboard box , while her boss told her she 'd be " fine			0
" suddenly , the years of stress , the long on - call hours felt like a waste			2
" i was angry , angrier than i had ever been , " she recalls			0
" i put everything i had into that job			0
" after sending out dozens of job applications and not hearing back , she decided to pay her ex-husband , a tattooist , a visit			0
she wanted to give tattooing a shot , maybe just as a part - time job until she found her next management gig			1
he was hesitant to help her			0
" the life of a tattoo artist is one of feast or famine , " she said			2
" he knew i had three kids to raise and that it would n't be stable income , but i insisted			0
so , he spent months making me draw			0
" at age 37 , she quickly learned she was a rarity in the business ; few middle - aged women were signing up to become tattoo artists			1
as an apprentice working among other artists -- all men -- she sometimes heard she was too " soft " to be in the industry , or too old to start learning			2
while apprenticing at a shop in @entity26 , she met @entity106 , a 30 - year veteran of tattooing			1
@entity106 taught @entity23 how to draw lines and quick sketches , techniques tattoo artists use to ink their customers quickly , " before they change their minds , " he jokes			2
@entity106 was impressed by @entity23 's persistence , despite the negativity she heard from her male counterparts			0
" there are a lot of guys who do n't like ( female tattoo artists ) , " he said			2
" @entity122 is a big egotistical thing , especially in the tattoo world			2
" after @entity23 apprenticed with him for a year , @entity106 encouraged her to take another step by purchasing a tattoo shop that was going on sale in @entity26			1
" if you meet her , you would understand why she would run a shop in this industry , " @entity106 said			1
" with her background in management , she was perfect to run the books the legal way			0
a lot of shops half - ass the things they do			2
" and she had her own ideas about how a shop should look and feel			2
@entity23 remembered apprenticing at a tattoo shop in 2008 , looking up at pictures of half - naked women strung on the walls			1
it was n't the kind of place anyone could just walk into , she thought			0
as wearing tattoos was becoming mainstreamâ € ” more than 14 % of people in the @entity152 have tattoos -- @entity23 felt confident she could cater her business toward previously under - served clientele			1
" i felt a need to create something more accommodating for women and anyone else that did n't want to feel like they were entering a shady establishment , " she said			2
in her shop , there are no photos of nude girls			2
instead , there are colorful paintings of wildflowers , abstract shapes , and warped skulls , it 's reminiscent of @entity176 artwork hanging in the @entity177 of @entity178 , a place where @entity23 says she draws artistic inspiration			0
although experts usually advise against tapping into your 401 ( k ) , @entity23 cashed hers out , using $ 12,000 to buy the tattoo shop and new equipment			1
so far , she says , the bet has paid off			0
@entity23 says she has seen steady success since launching her shop in 2008			2
she has n't replenished her 401 ( k ) , but it 's among next year 's goals			0
" my clientele ranges from 80 - year - old women to leaders of churches and doctors and lawyers , " she said			2
" i wanted to create a shop where anyone would feel safe and like family			1
" it 's that kind feel of that drew customers like @entity1 , who now refers others to the shop			0
" it 's a very cherished thing , " @entity1 said			0
" @entity3 really takes the time to produce something that is as special as the reason why you are getting it			1
" @entity23 says she 's on track to grow the business , and happier now than when she worked her corporate job			0
" it was very hard going from being in careers where you are at the top of your game , winning awards of excellence , being the expert at things , to being a nobody that knew nothing , " she said			0
" ( @entity228 ) is not a job			0
i have no idea what each day brings and i like helping people , giving them beautiful works of art that they can be proud of			0
