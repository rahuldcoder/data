-- in @entity3 politics , there is strength in numbers			0
when enough people feel a vested interest in the survival of a program , it becomes extraordinarily difficult for opponents to dismantle it			1
@entity13 , officially the @entity13 , looks like it has just reached a critical tipping point			1
while the program still faces many challenges and numerous @entity19 remained determined to keep attacking , the news that 7 million people have enrolled through the health care exchanges is a big victory for president @entity21 and his supporters			1
medicaid enrollment rose by 3 million people , much of which is a result of @entity13 as well			1
rather than @entity13 being an abstract promise to @entity3 that will be fulfilled in the distant future , now the @entity13 is a concrete program upon which millions of @entity3 voters will be depending			1
as that number increases , opponents of @entity13 will be going after the benefits of many millions of @entity3 -- not just the president			1
there is a long history of government programs securing their political strength through sheer numbers			2
although @entity39 remained a problematic and controversial program between 1935 and 1950 -- with some officials wondering whether it would even survive -- by the time that @entity44 was president , there were fewer legislators willing to express such doubts			1
@entity49 and @entity19 legislators found their districts inhabited by elderly @entity3 who counted on these government pensions and workers who were paying payroll taxes			0
this is why legislators would increase benefits every election year			0
agricultural supports have been equally strong since being put into place during the @entity61			0
as farmers , farms and the entire agricultural industry came to depend on federal government assistance to ensure that prices remained stable , legislators shied away from trying to fix the program			2
even legislators who represented urban districts had little interest in angering powerful rural representatives and senators whose constituents would not tolerate anyone tampering with their programs			2
when @entity44 's secretary of agriculture @entity77 went after the program , @entity19 suffered			1
" @entity77 , " one reporter said when covering the 1954 midterm elections , " has become the [ @entity49 ' ] fall guy , replacing the tired image of @entity82			0
" in the years before @entity88 passed @entity89 and @entity90 in 1965 , opponents -- including powerful voices in the health insurance industry and the @entity87 -- railed against the plan as " socialized medicine " that would empower the government to make all the decisions doctors had once had control over			1
but president @entity96 and the @entity88 overcame their opposition to put into place these two major domestic programs			2
by the 1970s , serious opposition fell away			0
doctors were depending on @entity89 to fund their patients			2
hospitals and states were planning on the @entity90 budget to keep their health systems going			0
and elderly patients no longer suffered the risk of not being able to seek treatment in their old age			0
as a result , nobody really wanted to get rid of these programs			0
although there were fights to reform @entity89 's regulatory structure and to cut costs since the 1980s , the strength of the programs has been formidable			1
there has been , thus far , little possibility that either would be scrapped			0
the same has been true for defense spending			0
the surge of military contracts in @entity126 and @entity127 states during the 1940s and 1950s became a staple to the economic success of the @entity132			0
there are many reasons why defense spending is hard to retrench , but most important is the huge number of people who will vote and lobby against you if you take a step in this direction			0
@entity13 is now starting to reach this same territory			2
for this reason alone , it makes sense that @entity21 is smiling			2
while the program does not have the tens of millions of people who are in the @entity89 or @entity39 programs , the numbers are growing			1
@entity13 will continue to face political attacks and implementation challenges , but the enrollment level virtually ensures serious debates over repealing @entity13 are now dead .			1

more than 7 million people have signed up for @entity13 coverage
@entity156 says that ensures that president @entity21 's *signature* program will endure
as with @entity89 and farm *subsidies* , programs that benefit millions tend to last , he says
@entity156 : @entity13 will face implementation challenges , but talk of repeal is *aimless*
