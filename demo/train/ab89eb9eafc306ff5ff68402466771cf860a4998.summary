@entity0 , the @entity1 leaker , has given a wide - ranging interview to the @entity3 about the effects of the startling information he shared this year with journalists , shedding light on the @entity9 surveillance apparatus			1
the revelations from @entity0 , a former @entity1 contractor , about the @entity9 government 's surveillance of its citizens and allies have generated fierce debate over intelligence - gathering practices			1
here are five key takeaways from the interview , the first @entity0 has given in person since he arrived in @entity21 in june			1
his mission is ' already accomplished ' " for me , in terms of personal satisfaction , the mission 's already accomplished			1
i already won , " @entity0 told the @entity3 's @entity26 in @entity27			1
" as soon as the journalists were able to work , everything that i had been trying to do was validated			2
because , remember , i did n't want to change society			2
i wanted to give society a chance to determine if it should change itself			2
" @entity0 left his job in @entity34 with the @entity1 contract firm @entity35 and fled to @entity36 in may , taking with him a hoard of secret information about intelligence programs			1
he shared the files with @entity26 and journalists from @entity42 , a @entity43 newspaper			2
the ensuing articles about how the @entity1 hoovers up vast amounts of phone and @entity48 data about @entity9 citizens sparked an uproar , with @entity0 described as a hero by some and a traitor by others			1
many more articles about other controversial aspects of @entity9 surveillance have followed , and @entity0 has said there 's plenty more information still to be revealed			1
his actions have had clear consequences			0
a review of @entity1 surveillance practices ordered by the @entity64 has recommended changes to the program , including greater judicial oversight and more public transparency in the collection of data			2
key @entity9 allies , like @entity72 and @entity73 , have publicly condemned @entity9 surveillance of their leaders			2
" all i wanted was for the public to be able to have a say in how they are governed , " @entity0 said			1
" that is a milestone we left a long time ago			0
right now , all we are looking at are stretch goals			0
" @entity26 told @entity82 that his impression was not that @entity0 was gloating , but that his goal to strip some of the secrecy off the @entity1 's activities had been achieved			1
he 's become ' an indoor cat ' @entity0 has so far managed to dodge the @entity9 government 's attempts to bring him back to @entity9 to face charges of espionage and theft of government property			1
and he 's not taking any chances as he lives in asylum in @entity21			0
@entity26 reported that during more than 14 hours of conversations in @entity27 , @entity0 did n't once " part the curtains or step outside			1
" @entity0 , 30 , described his life as that of an " indoor cat			1
" he said he does n't drink alcohol and lives on ramen noodles and chips			0
" it has always been really difficult to get me to leave the house , " he told @entity26			0
" i just do n't have a lot of needs			0
... occasionally there 's things to go do , things to go see , people to meet , tasks to accomplish			0
but it 's really got to be goal - oriented , you know			0
otherwise , as long as i can sit down and think and write and talk to somebody , that 's more meaningful to me than going out and looking at landmarks			0
" @entity26 said @entity0 is the kind of person who usually keeps to himself indoors anyway			1
he said @entity0 does not want to continuing being part of the story , but wants to see his cause advance			1
@entity0 has had continuous access to the @entity48 and talks to journalists and his lawyers on a daily basis , the @entity3 reported			1
people who visit him bring him books , but he does n't read them , preferring to get his information from the @entity48			0
@entity26 reported that it was unclear to what degree @entity0 was under surveillance by @entity21 authorities , saying that " no retinue " accompanied @entity0 and that he did n't see anybody else nearby			1
he raised flags before going public @entity0 said some other people who worked for the @entity1 's surveillance system also had misgivings about the activities			1
he told @entity26 that he raised concerns with colleagues and with superiors in the @entity1 's @entity149 and the @entity151 's regional base in @entity34			1
his co-workers were often " astonished to learn we are collecting more in the @entity9 on @entity9 than we are on @entity21 in @entity21 , " @entity0 told the @entity3			1
a lot of his colleagues were disturbed by what they heard , @entity0 said , and several asked him not to tell them any more			1
" i asked these people , ' what do you think the public would do if this was on the front page ? ' " he said , according to the @entity3			1
" how is that not reporting it ? how is that not raising it ? " he said in response to criticism that he circumvented the @entity1 's internal channels for disagreement			0
the @entity1 said in a statement to the @entity3 that it had " not found any evidence to support mr. @entity0 's contention that he brought these matters to anyone 's attention			1
the intelligence community 's overseers ' elected ' him @entity0 has faced widespread criticism over his actions from @entity179 administration officials and members of @entity181			2
but he told @entity26 that the @entity9 government left him little choice			0
asked why he felt entitled to bring the @entity1 's intrusive activities to public attention , @entity0 told the @entity3 : " that whole question -- who elected you ? -- inverts the model			1
" he singled out the chairmen of the @entity193 and @entity64 intelligence committees , sen. @entity194 and rep. @entity195 , both of whom have voiced criticism of his leaks			0
" it was n't that they put it on me as an individual -- that i 'm uniquely qualified , an angel descending from the heavens -- as that they put it on someone , somewhere , " he said			0
" you have the capability , and you realize every other ( person ) sitting around the table has the same capability but they do n't do it			2
so somebody has to be the first			0
" he said his aim was not to bring down the @entity1 , but to improve it			0
" i am still working for the @entity1 right now , " he said			0
" they are the only ones who do n't realize it			0
personal attacks do n't faze him ever since he stepped into the public eye , @entity0 has insisted that he should not be at the center of the story			2
the real issue , he says , is the @entity1 's far - reaching surveillance programs			2
he maintained that stance with @entity26 , saying that he 's shrugged off personal attacks against him with the intent of keeping the focus on the @entity1			0
" let them say what they want , " he said			0
" it 's not about me			0
" he dismissed suggestions that he 's made any deals with the governments of the countries where he 's taken refuge from @entity9 authorities			0
" there is no evidence at all for the claim that i have loyalties to @entity21 or @entity245 or any country other than the @entity9 , " @entity0 told @entity26			2
" i have no relationship with the @entity21 government			0
i have not entered into any agreements with them			0
" " if i defected at all , " @entity0 said , " i defected from the government to the public			2
