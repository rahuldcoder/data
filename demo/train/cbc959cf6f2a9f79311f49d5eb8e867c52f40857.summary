@entity1 , @entity0 -- exactly a year after a crash that killed 10 spectators and the pilot of a modified @entity7 era airplane , the @entity1 returned to action in the skies over western @entity0			1
an emotional memorial ceremony was held around noon sunday ( 3 p.m. et ) at @entity11 , stirring up sad , difficult memories for the thousands in attendance and bringing at least one son of a person killed in last year 's crash to tears			1
reflecting on the " devastating blow " that last year 's crash dealt to the @entity1 " air race family , " @entity19 president and ceo @entity18 talked about the " tremendous sorrow " many had experienced and the resilience and courage of those whose relatives were killed			1
" in their absence , our lives have changed , " @entity18 said of the 11 victims			0
" yet i have seen firsthand that through their memories and through watching and getting to know those they left behind , we can better understand what it means to love and to live			0
" @entity38 sen. @entity37 , @entity39 , then gave brief descriptions of each person killed			0
a short time later , the victims ' names were read out again -- with a white balloon released into the air for each one			2
the ceremony ended with a parachutist dropping in with the @entity38 flag at the end of the national anthem soon thereafter , races resumed with aircraft once again crisscrossing the skies			2
earlier , @entity18 said most people would not have bet that the @entity1 would happen this year			1
that did not hold true , though there have been notable differences : advance ticket sales were down 7 % to 8 % from previous years , and the crowds in the first few days since the event opened on wednesday have been smaller , the association 's leader said			2
according to the @entity69 , last year 's crash of the modified @entity66 airplane -- named " @entity68 " and flown by pilot @entity67 -- was caused by the failure of several lock nuts on the left trim tab , which is part of the airplane 's tail			1
the worn nuts allowed the screws to loosen , ultimately leading the aircraft to plunge into the ground in front of the box seating area , killing @entity67 and 10 spectators			1
more than 60 others were injured			0
@entity69 : high speed , worn parts led to deadly @entity1 crash the @entity86 made several changes ahead of this year 's event to improve safety , as recommended by the federal safety board and the association 's own expert panel			1
for instance , airplanes now must demonstrate their airworthiness at racing speeds before the races			0
spectators will be seated farther from the course			0
the course itself has been " flattened , " including the tight turn where last year 's accident occurred			1
veteran pilot @entity104 , who was part of the race association 's expert panel , watched last year 's accident unfold and commended the changes			1
the pace plane pilot said he and other pilots believe last year 's crash was a fluke and that the plane could have crashed anywhere			1
" we 're pushing the envelope , and when you 're pushing for speed , things happen			0
but when it affects the public that 's a different story			0
" first - time visitor @entity123 , a disaster restoration business owner from @entity125 , @entity126 , agrees			0
members of his family have been coming to the @entity0 races for years , and he had no hesitation about joining them this year			1
even though his cousin saw the accident last year from the grandstands , @entity123 said , " i know it was a freak thing			0
" @entity123 's biggest disappointment is that part of the course was moved back per the @entity69 's recommendation			0
" the closer the better , " he said but he also understands why the race organizers had to make the changes			0
the five - day @entity1 features six classes of race planes , some acrobatic performances and flights by military demonstration teams			2
the distance and number of pylons the planes have to circle varies by class , but it is the " unlimited " contests that draw the most fans			0
unlimited race planes are generally modified @entity7 era fighter planes , some of which can fly at nearly 500 miles per hour			1
one plane known as @entity159 -- another modified @entity66 like the one @entity67 crashed -- ran a qualifying heat of 493 miles per hour			2
excitement , speed key to air racing 's appeal -- and risk stunt pilot @entity67 built his life around love of flight			2
