-- using archival footage and photographs , producers @entity1 and @entity3 made the @entity7 documentary " @entity8 : in his own words , " which follows the life of @entity11 sen. @entity8			1
sen. @entity8 " worked like a bull " to advance his brothers ' unfinished work , @entity1 says			1
the film profiles @entity8 , who died late tuesday , from birth through his speech last year at the @entity20			1
@entity1 began the project after @entity8 was diagnosed with brain cancer last year			1
@entity1 previously profiled @entity8 's brothers , president @entity24 and sen. @entity25 , in similar documentaries for @entity7			1
on wednesday , @entity0 asked @entity1 about the production of the latest profile -- which @entity0 will show wednesday night -- and what he learned about the youngest of the @entity8 brothers			1
@entity0 : why focus on @entity8 ? why were you drawn to him as a subject ? was it the natural follow - up to your previous work about his brothers ? @entity1 : i grew up with parents who were liberal democrats			1
i remember my mother crying as she listened to the radio report that president @entity8 had been shot			1
so nearly 20 years ago , when i produced " @entity42 : in his own words " for @entity7 , it was a subject i knew and cared a lot about			2
i knew less about @entity25 when i produced " @entity47 : in his own words " a few years later -- and even less about @entity8			2
( although my uncle , @entity49 , ran against him for @entity50 in 1962			0
) when i was producing those other documentaries on his brothers , @entity8 was in his 50s , he was busy building his own career , and there was never even discussion about producing a program about him			1
two decades later , when it was announced he was diagnosed with brain cancer and that he was coming up on nearly half a century in the @entity50 , @entity7 and i did n't even have to discuss it			2
we all instinctively knew it was time			0
@entity0 : did you have preconceived notions about @entity8 that interviews either reinforced or dispelled ? @entity1 : my preconceived notion was that @entity8 was the carefree younger brother who rode his brothers ' coattails and did not work as hard as they did			1
but , yes , that was dispelled as we dug into his story and as our chief researcher , @entity76 , began finding the film to prove otherwise			0
no @entity8 ever worked harder then @entity8			2
i 'd say he was a slow starter , but once he took on the responsibility for his big family in particular and for the @entity80 in general , he never let up on himself			0
he worked like a bull			0
he stumbled plenty of times , he had personal faults , he caused others great pain , but he recognized this , he was pained by this , and each time he picked himself up and worked harder to make himself better			0
@entity0 : how did you obtain some of the rarely seen home movies and photographs used in the documentary ? @entity1 : we simply looked everywhere , and we knew we were onto something that had not been done before when so many sources told us that they had never been asked for @entity8 - related material			1
in fact , often we were transferring 16mm footage that had never been transferred before			2
even the networks were surprised by the outtakes we found in their archives			0
it 's all there , it just took time and a dedicated staff			2
@entity0 : were there any surprises during the filming of the documentary ? did someone say something remarkable or unexpected about @entity8 ? did a source material reveal something that is contrary to the @entity8 many assume they know ? @entity1 : we did no original filming for this documentary ; it is 100 percent created using historical footage and audio that was made during different points of @entity8 's life			1
that 's what gives it authenticity , i think			2
it 's something my partner at @entity7 , @entity3 , insisted upon			2
so sticking to the " in his own words " format of those original two docs was the single most important decision we made			0
@entity0 : why do you think @entity11 cling to an idea of " @entity140 ? " what has @entity140 come to mean in the @entity143 age ? @entity1 : president @entity143 himself clings to @entity140 -- and made that very clear when he thanked @entity8 for his early support			1
he , like so many @entity11 , was inspired first by @entity8 's brothers , then by @entity8 himself			1
and one of the things that impressed me was how @entity8 never ceased to try and continue to advance the unfinished work of his brothers			1
he was incredibly loyal to them and the causes they represented			0
i think when someone is rich and powerful and glamorous and stands up for his principles and looks after the neediest @entity11 and speaks out for the downtrodden around the world , it spells " @entity140 " for a lot of people			0
@entity0 : much has been made of @entity8 's relationship with president @entity143			1
what did @entity8 say about that and about the relationship itself ? @entity1 : @entity8 made it very clear that he was handing over the mantle that he had been carrying ever since his brother handed it to him			1
i think he saw @entity143 as the embodiment of everything he believed in and everything that he had worked so hard to make happen			0
it must have been incredibly rewarding for him			0
@entity0 : what was @entity8 's reaction when the subject of @entity180 was broached ? how comfortable was he talking about it ? @entity1 : again , we did not conduct a new interview , but instead we knit his story together from his responses to many earlier interview questions			1
early on he was incredibly uncomfortable speaking about it , humiliated by it			0
he seemed to cringe and dodge and lower his head			0
but over time , he was asked about it so often that he built up a shield , a formula response to deflect the questions that never stopped coming			0
he knew that a life was lost because of his actions , but he moved on			0
that 's what he did so often			2
@entity0 : what do you think @entity8 believed about how he was publicly perceived , both in politics and in his personal life ? @entity1 : he knew people loved him and hated him			1
his last campaign was his hardest , and he realized he had to regain the trust of many whose trust he had lost			0
and i think during the 80s , when he really did want to be president , he believed that the public would support him , despite @entity180			0
but that did not happen			0
then , once he resolved to commit himself to the @entity50 , i think he was surprised that the public would never let go of this idea that he wanted to be president			0
@entity0 : what ultimately drove @entity8 as a politician ? @entity1 : his parents			1
at his mother 's funeral he said that everything he and his brothers ever did , they did for their parents			2
he cared deeply about the issues he stood for , but you ca n't forget who instilled the work ethic in him in the first place			0
@entity8 was a family man because of the deep influence of his parents , particularly his mother .			2
