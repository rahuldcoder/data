alzheimer 's disease ravages the brain , robbing its victims not only of their memories but often their ability to do things as basic as swallowing			0
now , a study of aging patients suggests its true toll may top half a million lives a year -- a figure that would put @entity11 's just below heart disease and cancer on the list of @entity16 's top killers			1
the incurable , degenerative brain disease was blamed for 83,000 - plus @entity16 fatalities in 2010 , making it the sixth - leading cause of death that year			1
but its true toll may be as much as six times that , said @entity24 , an epidemiologist at the @entity25 in @entity26			0
" death certificates are well known to underreport deaths from @entity11 's and other types of dementia , " said @entity24 , the lead author of the study published wednesday			1
" the more immediate causes of death , such as pneumonia or heart attack , are usually listed , and the underlying causes of death are usually left off			0
" the eight - year study , published in the peer - reviewed journal @entity40 , followed more than 2,500 people over 65			2
of those , nearly a quarter developed @entity11 's , and the disease was the cause of death in about 400 people , @entity24 said			1
overwhelming burden , cost of @entity11 's to triple , report says @entity24 and his colleagues -- co-workers at @entity51 in @entity26 and at two @entity53 institutions , the @entity52 and the @entity54 there -- then statistically extrapolated their results to arrive at their estimate of 503,000 @entity11 's deaths a year			2
by comparison , heart disease was blamed for nearly 600,000 deaths in 2010 and cancer about 575,000 -- but those numbers are going down , while deaths from @entity11 's are going up			2
" i could n't say when , but in the next 20 years , it could catch up to cancer , " @entity24 said			0
the study was funded by the @entity67 and the @entity68			0
@entity69 , who oversees population studies of @entity11 's and dementia at the @entity67 , called the findings " eye - catching			1
" " people who i think are knowledgeable about the death registration system in the @entity16 would not be surprised that the official number is low , but it is somewhat of a surprise to see that kind of a difference , " @entity69 told @entity73			2
similar studies are under way , and similar results would bolster the findings of @entity24 and his colleagues , he said			0
in the meantime , the results might encourage more doctors to note @entity11 's when filling out death certificates -- something an increasing number of physicians have been doing already			1
" it 's just another reminder that @entity11 's is really an important public health problem , and we need to work on it , " @entity69 said			2
the 10 warning signs of @entity11 's @entity98 , the science program director of the @entity99 , said the new study 's mortality estimate is " much closer to the true number			1
" " the @entity99 has been saying for a long time that that 80,000 figure is a gross undercount , " @entity98 said			1
the new figures may help @entity16 realize that @entity11 's is n't " just about forgetfulness , " but " a universally fatal brain disease			1
" " we think this is a solid paper that really puts the true impact of the disease into perspective , " he added			0
the @entity99 , which supports more research into causes and treatments , estimates that 5.2 million @entity16 had alzheimer 's disease in 2013			1
@entity11 's deaths went up by 68 % over the past decade as mortality from other major diseases declined , and the association expects the number of people over 65 with the disease to climb to 7.1 million by 2025			2
in 2012 , the @entity126 administration announced plans to pour another $ 156 million into @entity11 's research			1
the @entity129 has about $ 560 million currently budgeted for the work			0
but the @entity99 estimates the disease costs more than $ 200 billion per year -- and since the patients are mostly elderly , much of that is paid by the federal health programs @entity135 and @entity136			0
the promised increase in research funding is " a step in the right direction , " but not enough , @entity98 said			0
" scientists have told us we need to invest $ 2 billion a year for 10 years if we are truly going to move the needle on alzheimer 's disease , " he said			0
alzheimer 's disease fast facts			0

a new study suggests @entity11 's may be the third - leading @entity16 cause of death
current figures are " a gross undercount , " @entity99 says
the study followed 2,500 patients for 8 years ; 400 died of @entity11 's
*advocates* hope the findings will build support for more research
