-- " mother , mother , there 's too many of you crying			2
/ brother , brother , brother , there is far too many of you dying			2
/ you know we got to find a way to bring some lovin ' here today			2
/ @entity12 , father , we do n't need to escalate			2
you see war is not the answer , for only love can conquer hate ... " from " @entity19 , " sung by @entity18 in 1971			0
in @entity20 , we asked that simple question of people in the heart of communities plagued by violence			1
what 's going on ? " we need jobs , education , recreation and we want to live , we want to feel safe , " is mainly what young people told us			1
they shared their stories with mayor @entity32 , the rev. @entity33 of @entity34 , the rev. @entity35 of @entity37 jesuit college prep school and me			1
a young man said : " when i grow up i want to be a lawyer			0
i am good at arguing and debating			0
my friends call me good news because i always take the positive side of the argument			0
" another young man said , " i 'm good with the pen			0
i write short stories and put music behind the story so you can really hear what i 'm saying			0
" nurses dodge bullets to provide care what we heard was that they all have hopes and dreams			0
not one of them dreamed or aspired to a life of crime			1
among the violence and death that so many experience , hope is alive			0
i was not shocked or surprised			0
it is what i expected to hear and what i knew : these kids want to belong and they want to feel valued and , yes , respected			1
earning respect , having a positive reputation and being a valued member of a group or a team is partly the reason i 'm where i am today ; i was taught i could achieve these virtues by playing on a basketball team			1
too many of our kids try to achieve them by being in a gang			1
we need to teach our young people that respect is given and never taken , that reputation comes from doing honest work and not hard time			0
they need to know the only group worth being a part of requires giving back through teamwork			0
my coaches , mentors and teachers taught me those lessons when i was growing up on @entity20 's @entity95			1
they taught me to use my sports platform to help others , better the community and better others ' lives			1
it can be the crucial difference for thousands of young people , whose only knowledge of a structured organization comes from gangs			2
@entity20 's murder rate : do n't blame the guns alone over the years , sports and play have broken down racial and cultural barriers			1
we believe that once kids who might be at risk get to know each other and play sports together , the murder rate will drop			1
in fully functioning parks and schools , we can win their hearts and minds and create safe places for them to interact with each other			2
i am proud to join forces with mayor @entity32 to expand the " @entity129 " basketball league , which would extend our friday and saturday night tournaments to 10 more @entity20 parks beginning in march			1
this is where all of us come in			0
we are calling on all @entity132 to donate what they can at cityofchicago.org / hoops in order to reach our goal of $ 500,000			0
with that money , we can provide an additional 3,200 young people in @entity20 a safe alternative to drugs , gangs and violence , one hoop at a time			1
donations will go toward buying a jersey , paying a referee for a game , reserving a court or supporting another part of the program			0
this effort began last fall when i met the mayor at a saturday morning basketball game at @entity155 on the @entity95			1
the tournament brought rival gang members together to compete			0
when the colors came off and the jerseys went on , nobody saw gang members : we just saw great athletes playing classic @entity20 basketball			1
my view : how we talk about guns in my @entity20 classroom right then , the mayor and i started working out how we could give as many young people as possible across @entity20 this opportunity to show off their skills and do what they love in a safe place			1
whether it is 3 - on - 3 or 5 - on - 5 competition , basketball teaches you how to get along in a group ; it teaches you how to set common goals and work with others to achieve them			1
from the courts on the @entity95 to the @entity182 , those are lessons that stayed with me my entire life , and they can give other kids from a similar background a better shot			1
i believe deeply in what the mayor is trying to achieve because i see the incredible potential in @entity20 's young people			1
when i walk down the street in @entity193 or @entity194 or @entity195 , i do n't see criminals or gang bangers or thugs ; i see athletes and artists and academics capable of great things			0
our challenge is often to get them to see themselves in the same light			0
right now , too many kids are n't optimistic because they do n't have much to look back on with pride			2
we can change that ; we can give them an opportunity to build up their confidence and build up each other			0
we can help them see clearly that they have choices			0
poverty should no longer be wedded to drugs and weapons			0
we want them to know that education is the only true way to better their lives			2
opinion : @entity20 's violence took my dad , friends our kids are worth saving and they 're worth fighting for			1
if you ca n't give resources , give them your time ; have conversations with them , and become a strong mentor			0
being present and showing up can change a kid 's life for the better			2
i know , because i was one of those kids			2
