-- our experience in @entity3 provides three essential lessons that should guide @entity6 's response to the @entity9 regime 's alleged use of chemical weapons against its own people			1
first , the president must present the @entity6 people and the international community with clear evidence that the @entity17 regime was responsible for the use of chemical weapons			1
the @entity21 administration took @entity6 to war in @entity3 based on the false claim that @entity24 had weapons of mass destruction , including stockpiles of chemical weapons			1
those false claims not only led us into a costly and unnecessary war , but did lasting damage to @entity6 's credibility			0
that erosion of credibility is haunting us now , as many in the international community question our claim that the @entity17 regime used chemical weapons			1
that makes it imperative that the @entity41 administration present clear and convincing evidence that the @entity17 regime was responsible for the chemical weapons use			1
second , if the @entity41 administration presents such evidence , it is essential that the @entity6 and the international community take strong action to punish the regime and deter the future use of chemical weapons in @entity9 or elsewhere in the world			1
again , the @entity3 example is instructive			0
many would like to forget the fact that the @entity6 and the international community willfully ignored @entity24 's use of chemical weapons against @entity58 during the @entity59 and against @entity3 's @entity61 population in 1988 in the aftermath of that war			1
i remember those days well			0
together with @entity65 , my former colleague on the staff of the @entity67 , i traveled to the @entity3 - @entity69 border in september 1988 to investigate @entity24 's chemical weapons offensive against the @entity71			1
we returned to @entity73 to urge the @entity6 government to impose economic sanctions against @entity3 for its use of chemical weapons			1
while the @entity79 did pass such legislation , it was opposed by the @entity82 administration and never made it out of the @entity84			0
recently released @entity86 documents demonstrate that the @entity82 administration deliberately ignored @entity3 's use of chemical weapons because it favored @entity3 in its war against @entity58			2
but the failure of that sanctions legislation represented a failure of the @entity6 to help enforce the international convention against the use of chemical weapons			2
a strong case can be made that the refusal of the @entity6 and the international community to confront @entity24 for his flagrant violations of the international ban on chemical weapons emboldened him to take additional reckless actions			1
in 1990 , he miscalculated the international response to his invasion of @entity105			0
years later , even after he had destroyed his chemical weapons stockpile , he underestimated the depth of international concern that he was still hiding them			2
that is perhaps not surprising , considering that the international community did nothing when @entity24 actually used chemical weapons in the 1980s			0
the @entity6 and the international community must not again stand idly by if the @entity17 regime , or another party , has used chemical weapons			1
it must take action to uphold international norms and send a clear signal that breaches of the international ban on chemical weapons use will not be tolerated			2
failure to act upon strong evidence will only encourage @entity126 and other international actors to use chemical weapons in the future			2
the third lesson from @entity3 is equally important as the first two			0
our mission must be clearly defined and achievable at an acceptable cost			1
in 1990 , president @entity21 established a well defined goal -- using force to oust @entity24 's forces from @entity105			0
he deliberately chose not to send @entity6 troops to @entity138 to topple @entity24 , because he rightfully determined that the @entity6 would not be able to contain the violent fallout without a huge commitment of @entity6 lives and treasure			0
president @entity143 later made the mistake that his father avoided			0
the @entity3 war clearly established that even massive @entity6 troop intervention on the ground for over eight years can not change many of the basic cultural and sectarian forces at play in the region			2
today , despite the huge sacrifice in @entity6 and @entity3 lives , @entity3 is rocked by almost daily eruptions of sectarian violence			0
the @entity6 - backed , @entity157 - dominated government of @entity3 now allows @entity58 planes to use its airspace to supply weapons to @entity17 and the minority shiite @entity162 sect that controls @entity9			1
meanwhile , @entity164 and @entity166 extremists in @entity3 are fighting to defeat the government in @entity138 as @entity164 and @entity166 extremist forces in @entity9 are fighting in tandem with @entity6 - supported rebels to defeat the @entity17 regime			1
the toxic mix of forces suggests that even a large @entity6 troop presence in @entity9 would be unlikely to change these deep - running currents			0
these lessons are important as president @entity41 defines the purpose of @entity6 military action in @entity9 in response to the use of chemical weapons			1
the president should make clear that the goal of our military action is to punish @entity9 for its blatantly illegal use of chemical weapons and to deter the future use of such weapons by the @entity9 regime or others that might contemplate their use in future conflicts			1
our action should be coupled with a clear statement that any future use of chemical weapons will be met with increasing force			2
this goal can be reasonably accomplished by using cruise missile strikes that inflict significant pain and damage on @entity17 's forces without putting @entity6 lives in the line of fire			0
some have argued that it is pointless for the @entity6 to engage in punitive military strikes against @entity9 unless our actions are designed to decisively tip the military balance toward the rebels			0
that claim downplays the more limited , but nevertheless important , objective of deterring the future use of chemical weapons			0
moreover , defining the success of our response as decisively changing the military balance is unrealistic , unachievable without putting @entity6 lives at risk , and will ultimately drag the @entity6 toward full - scale intervention in a @entity9 civil war			2
gen. @entity220 , chairman of the @entity221 , has stated that measures like the establishment of a no - fly zone would put @entity6 pilots at risk and may not change the situation on the ground			0
measuring success of these actions in terms of changing the tide of the war will lead inexorably to further assertions that @entity6 credibility is at stake and suck @entity6 into a costly civil war that could , with the current configuration of forces , result in the extremist @entity164 elements among the rebels gaining the upper hand			0
that is why it is so important to define this particular mission in a way that can be achieved at an acceptable cost			2
let 's heed three important lessons from @entity3 : protect our credibility by presenting clear evidence of the use of chemical weapons by the @entity17 regime ; take strong action to punish the illegal use of chemical weapons and deter their future use ; and define the mission in achievable terms at a cost we are willing to pay			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity267 .			0

rep. @entity267 : three lessons from @entity3 can guide intervention in @entity9
he says president @entity41 must present clear evidence of @entity275 *culpability*
he says @entity6 must take strong action to punish @entity17 regime , deter use of chemical weapons
