-- @entity1 was slow to act against the booming counterfeit industry in @entity3 and other @entity5 countries , according to cables obtained by @entity7			1
the technology giant eventually organized a team in march 2008 to curtail the explosion of knockoff ipods and @entity12 , according to an electronic memo from the @entity15 embassy dated september 2008			0
yet , three years after @entity1 moved to crack down on widespread counterfeiting and put pressure on @entity3 , progress has been slow			1
gadget piracy is n't a high priority for the @entity3 government , the @entity19 reports and experts say			2
members of @entity1 's recently formed global security team were recruited from @entity27 after they executed a series of crackdowns on counterfeit @entity31 production in @entity5 , the report says			1
@entity32 , formerly @entity27 's security chief and , before that , a special agent for the @entity35 , leads @entity1 's global security unit			1
@entity37 , who worked for @entity32 at @entity27 , is now a director on @entity1 's security team in @entity39			1
@entity37 told the @entity15 embassy official that his group at @entity27 spent five years planning raids on counterfeit drug rings , the cable says			0
he said he 's " afraid " of the volume of imitation @entity1 products being produced in @entity3 and about the inexperience of @entity1 's lawyers in dealing with @entity3 authorities , the report says			1
an @entity1 spokeswoman declined to comment			0
a @entity27 spokeswoman , who declined to comment on personnel matters , said the company has a strong global security team to handle the increase in counterfeit medicine worldwide			1
@entity7 , a group that publishes private government documents , posted tens of thousands of previously unreleased @entity19 diplomatic cables last week			2
the reports from the @entity15 embassy detailing @entity1 's piracy crackdown were unclassified , but many were described as " sensitive " and " not for internet distribution			1
" in december , @entity1 said it removed an application from its mobile store that let people browse @entity7 documents from their iphones " because it violated developer guidelines			0
" the company suggested that the app broke laws or could be harmful to people , but many free - speech advocates cried censorship , as they have in the past when @entity1 has pulled apps			2
the fresh @entity7 documents shed new light on @entity1 's struggles with intellectual - property theft in @entity3 , but the subject has n't completely flown under the radar			1
last month , international news media were rapt after discovering that @entity3 is home not only to fake @entity1 gadgets but also to imitation @entity1 stores , which had many of @entity1 's signatures			1
the @entity3 government ordered two of the five unofficial stores to close because they had not secured proper business permits , but a spokesman for @entity3 's @entity96 government defended the others , saying they sell authentic @entity1 merchandise , according to @entity99			1
@entity1 owns and operates four stores in @entity3			2
the three in @entity15 and the one in @entity103 are @entity1 's highest trafficked and top grossing stores in the world , @entity101 , @entity1 's financial chief , said in an earnings call in january			1
but the hunger for @entity1 products is insatiable there			2
that 's why stores have begun to sell the products without @entity1 's permission , while others are hawking cheaper , lower - quality gadgets that are aesthetically similar and bear the chic @entity1 logo			1
@entity3 's @entity119 province , the country 's most populous region , has become a hub for manufacturing and selling counterfeit @entity1 products , two of the newly surfaced cables say			1
the @entity125 , which assembles products for @entity1 , operates factories in @entity119			2
workers typically smuggle parts from the facilities in order to make replicas , said @entity132 , an international business professor for @entity133 in @entity134 who travels frequently to @entity5			0
it 's the cost of doing business in @entity3 , where many @entity19 companies go for inexpensive labor and efficient industrial plants , she said			2
" not to go to @entity3 is not really an option , " @entity140 said			0
" companies can not afford to do that			0
no one can afford to do that			0
" @entity3 's counterfeiting ring is responsible for supplying @entity148 with fake @entity1 products , the 2008 cable says			1
in raids , @entity148 officials uncovered shipments that had moved from @entity3 through @entity39 , the report says			0
@entity1 's early plans to go after counterfeiters , according to a cable , involved first targeting offending retailers and street vendors ; next , @entity1 would work with police to raid manufacturing facilities ; and finally , the company would pursue online resellers			1
the plans closely resemble @entity27 's successful strategy , the cable says , citing @entity37 , the @entity1 director			1
" @entity37 said that low - profile retail raids are a good option for @entity1 , a company that wants to stay away from too much publicity surrounding this issue , " the cable says			0
@entity32 , @entity37 's boss , briefed @entity170 , then ceo , on the plans in 2008 , the cable says			0
but @entity1 is having limited success			1
in countless stores and at tables setup on streets , merchants purporting to sell ipods , iphones and @entity176 at deeply discounted prices are prevalent , said @entity181 , a student in @entity182 who recently returned from studying abroad in @entity15			0
" they 'll say , ' yeah , we have @entity176			0
we 'll give you a really good deal , ' " @entity181 recalled from her shopping trips			0
" if i really want to buy a knockoff @entity1 product , i could probably do that in 15 minutes			0
" @entity3 officials readily cooperated with pharmaceutical companies on their raids , but that has n't translated to software , as @entity195 has discovered , or electronics , as @entity1 is learning , said @entity140 , the professor			2
whereas a defective pill could cause sickness or death , a shoddy @entity197 has less dire consequences			0
@entity1 had planned to strengthen its case with the government by arguing that defective batteries could blow up and injure people , and that lost tax revenue could have a significant economic impact , the cable says			0
the arguments were n't very effective			0
@entity3 's government declined to investigate a facility in march 2009 that was manufacturing imitation @entity1 laptops because it threatened local jobs , says a cable dated april 2009			2
a different arm of @entity3 's government scrapped plans for a raid on an electronics mall in the @entity119 province because it could have driven away shoppers , the cable says			2
@entity0 's @entity222 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 is faced with *mounting* counterfeiting of its products in @entity3
the company recruited from @entity27 's security team after its success , @entity19 cables say
despite efforts , @entity1 's plans have had limited success
