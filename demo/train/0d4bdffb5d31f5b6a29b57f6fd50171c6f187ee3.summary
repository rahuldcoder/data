-- @entity2 's father , @entity1 , said thursday it was difficult to listen to testimony about his son , particularly the negative comments , during @entity8 's trial			1
" that was n't the @entity2 that we raised			1
that was n't the @entity2 that we knew , and that we love , " he said during a thursday night interview on @entity0 's " @entity13 360			1
" still , @entity2 's mother , @entity15 , said that she felt the need to sit through every day of @entity8 's trial because her son was " not here to say anything for himself			1
" she said that she wanted to " show a face " for her son			2
@entity2 's parents spoke out thursday for the first time since @entity8 was acquitted in the death of 17 - year - old @entity2			1
@entity8 could still be held responsible " it came as a complete shock for me , " @entity26 said about the verdict			1
" and the reason i say that is because i just look at people as people , and i thought for sure that the jury looked at @entity2 as an average teenager that was minding his own business , that was n't committing any crime			1
" @entity2 's parents opted not to be in the courtroom when the verdict was read			1
they thought they would not be able to control their emotions -- whichever way the jury decided			0
when they heard , they broke down			0
" when i heard the verdict , i kind of understand the disconnect , " @entity26 said			2
" maybe they ( jurors ) did n't see @entity2 as their son			1
they did n't see @entity2 as a teenager			1
they did n't see @entity2 as just a human being that was minding his own business			1
" ' does the system work ? it did n't work for us ' @entity57 said he was n't concerned about the racial makeup of the jury before the start of the trial , which has become a forum for debate about gun laws and race in @entity66			1
but , like @entity26 , he believes jurors never saw the event from the perspective of his son			2
the jury had six women -- five white and one an unspecified minority			0
@entity57 said he believes juror @entity75 had her mind made up before the trial began			0
the juror gave an exclusive interview to @entity0 's @entity13 this week and said the jury felt like it knew @entity8 but did n't know enough about @entity2			1
@entity2 's dad : my heart is broken , my faith is not @entity2 's mother said that despite that comment , jurors had sufficient information			1
" they knew he was a teenager			0
they knew he was on his way home			0
they knew he ran , " she said			0
" ... how much do you need to know ? " referring to juror @entity75 's statement that she did not believe race was a factor in the shooting , @entity26 said , " i think that 's a joke			2
" @entity57 said that his children had grown up in a diverse community , so he had never felt feel a need to have a conversation about how his sons should deal with race			0
rather , he said he talked with his children about " how we prepare them to become teenagers , to become upstanding citizens , to conduct themselves in public			0
" but once his unarmed son was shot , he said that changed			2
" what is it i can tell my child now ? " he asked			0
in spite of his son 's death , @entity57 said he has faith in the legal system			2
" the state did all they could with what they had " given the poor quality of the investigation , he said			0
" does the system work ? it did n't work for us			1
we remain prayerful that through this injustice , we can close that gap and hopefully the system can start working for everyone equally			0
" ' hopefully , we can find some positive ' @entity2 's mother said that she hoped that a foundation started in her son 's name would allow for something good to come out of his death			1
" the change that we hope to affect is with the law , " @entity26 said			0
" we want to make sure any teenager who is walking down the street wont ' be killed , that they will make it home safe			0
" " hopefully , we can find some positive , some bright side out of all of this , " she said			0
the parents did not say whether they may file a civil lawsuit			1
@entity150 , an attorney for @entity2 's family who also appeared on " @entity13 360 , " said they are hoping for a federal civil rights investigation into the teenager 's death			1
he said they were pleased by the charges brought against @entity8 because they felt it got to the heart of the allegations			0
but he said he did not believe the police were aggressive with the shooting investigation , appearing to take @entity8 's word for it			0
" not only did ( @entity8 ) profile @entity2 , the police profiled @entity2 , " @entity150 said			2
' @entity167 takes time ' earlier thursday , in interviews on the three network tv morning news programs , @entity2 's parents assailed the verdict and the @entity8 defense team 's argument that the killing was in self - defense during an attack by the unarmed teenager			1
@entity26 told " @entity179 " she was " in a bit of shock " after the verdict			2
" i thought surely that he would be found guilty of second - degree murder , " she said			0
on @entity185 's " today , " @entity26 said the case is " sending a terrible message to other little black and brown boys -- that you ca n't walk fast , you ca n't walk slow			2
so what do they do ? i mean , how do you get home without people knowing or either assuming that you 're doing something wrong ? @entity2 was n't doing anything wrong			2
" speaking to @entity197 's " @entity196 , " @entity2 added that he and @entity26 did not find the verdict fair , " and of course it 's devastating			1
" " today " asked them whether they may forgive @entity8 , the 29 - year - old neighborhood watch volunteer			0
" @entity167 is like a healing process			0
forgiveness takes time , " @entity2 responded			2
" the @entity205 says that you have to forgive and forget , but also the healing process is a long process and the forgiving process is a long process			0
" @entity2 's friend ' upset , angry ' by verdict opinion : voices on the lessons of @entity8 trial juror pushes for new laws following @entity8 trial @entity0 's @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220 contributed to this report			1
