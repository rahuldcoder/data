' " @entity8 had been a single mother , working multiple jobs in the food service industry to make ends meet			0
" she did not know that she could do both , " @entity7 said			2
" you can be of service to people ... but you must take care of yourself first			0
" it 's not an uncommon story in @entity1			2

" i felt that people needed to be challenged			0
" @entity7 remembered how her sister had been too embarrassed to exercise in a gym with men			2
so in june 2006 , she opened an all - female workout facility , @entity51			0
the gym was a success -- it now has more than 600 members -- but @entity7 eventually realized that she needed to expand her reach if she wanted to slim down her community			2
she says part of the problem in @entity0 is that being overweight is so commonplace it is often considered the norm			2

she 's committed to weight loss , " said @entity0 mayor @entity94 , who lost 16 pounds			1
today , @entity66 includes a walking club , which draws up to 200 people , and a weekly nutrition class			1
@entity7 's gym is also open to all women every saturday , and she frequently teaches fitness classes at area schools and churches			1
all of these activities are free , something she believes is a critical factor			0
" it 's the poor african - american and white communities that are the most obese , and those are the ones that are most unreachable , " @entity7 said			0
as a successful real estate developer , @entity7 largely funds the effort herself , but the initiative also receives donations from local businesses			0
@entity116 , 22 , believes the program saved her life			0
after her 32 - year - old cousin died of kidney failure last year , @entity116 , who weighed 320 pounds , was frightened			0
" i felt as though if i did n't lose weight i was going to die , " she said			1
but fear drove her to take action			0
since joining @entity66 six months ago , @entity116 has lost 50 pounds			1
it 's those stories that keep @entity7 motivated			0
she 's determined to expand her effort statewide to find more converts to her cause			0
