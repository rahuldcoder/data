-- a @entity4 navy ship abandoned and lost in @entity2 @entity6 waters since the mid- 19th century has been found in relatively good shape at the bottom of a bay , the @entity2 government says			1
@entity10 has released images of the @entity12 , found late last month at the bottom of @entity14			1
the bay is located in the @entity17 ' @entity16			2
the discovery is part of two @entity2 archaeological missions to locate the investigator and two other ships			1
" this is definitely of the utmost importance , " said @entity23 , @entity10 's head of underwater archaeology			2
" the ship is standing upright in very good condition , " he told @entity0			1
" this is the first ship to sail the last leg of the @entity33 , " the @entity6 sea route connecting the @entity29 and @entity30 oceans			1
a first analysis of images " indicate that the structure of the ship lies on the bottom in relatively shallow water and is in good condition , particularly considering the depth , " said the agency , which manages the country 's parks and protects the country 's " natural and cultural heritage			1
" " the bottom of the vessel appears buried in sediment , and the structure rises to the upper deck , but the rigging and the bulwarks ( side walls above the upper deck ) have collapsed , likely damaged by the ice			0
" archaeologists from @entity10 are working to " understand the extent of the site and the debris field " and " will try to evaluate what is left on the wreck , how well it is preserved , and what are the environmental conditions impacting the wreck , " the agency said			0
the ship had been found by the @entity10 crew " in the first moments of the search , " it said			1
the sea floor lies 33 feet below the surface at the site			0
" fortunately , part of the bay where the ship had been abandoned became free of ice and the search began , " @entity10 said			2
" we planned to conduct the project at the end of july , " @entity23 said , " because it was the best opportunity to have good weather and open water in @entity14 , according to our observations based on many years of experience in this national park			2
" @entity88 capt. @entity87 led the 66 - man @entity12 on an 1850 expedition through @entity6 waters to rescue two other ships -- the @entity92 and the @entity93			1
those vessels , led by explorer sir @entity95 , were lost in the @entity6 during an 1845 voyage to discover a northwest passage			0
the @entity12 became " locked in ice " and eventually had to be abandoned in 1853			1
it left equipment and provisions on the shore , a previously known cache , @entity23 said			0
as part of its mission to find the investigator , archaeologists wanted to document the land sites tied to the ship 's mission			1
the crew found the grave sites of three crew members who died of scurvy			0
@entity23 said the abandonment reverberated historically			0
the event " had an impact on the @entity120 community			0
" " after the ship was abandoned , they came and harvested some of the ship 's materials , such as iron and copper " -- items that were previously unavailable to them , he said			2
@entity2 and @entity4 are " working collaboratively " on " what to do with the site and its artifacts , " @entity23 said , noting that the find represents part of a common heritage			1
@entity23 said @entity137 , an important figure in @entity2 history , has been credited with the discovery of the @entity33 and was knighted for that			1
" for the moment , we 're still looking at options but there 's no intention at present of raising the ship , " he said of the complex and delicate site			2
a project to raise the ship would be very expensive , he said			2
" we 're going to find the best way to protect the site , " he said			0
" we want to tell this story to the biggest audience			0
it 's part of world history			0
" in another project , a @entity10 and the @entity158 team will also be searching for the @entity92 and the @entity93 beginning on august 10			0
the search would be located southeast of @entity14 in @entity162 territory .			0

a sunken @entity4 navy ship is recovered in @entity2
" the ship is standing upright in very good condition "
the @entity12 had been on a mission to rescue two other ships
