@entity0 , @entity1 -- the ex-cop suspected in the killings of an officer and two others remained at large friday as darkness fell over a mountain forest and police suspended their manhunt until saturday morning			1
" once it gets dark out there and the snow keeps falling and they have no air support , i do n't know how effective they would be in that situation , " spokeswoman @entity11 of the @entity12 said			2

" police teams were dressed in snow gear , holding the trigger guards on their assault - style rifles while scouring eight square miles near @entity0 , a popular skiing area two hours east of @entity56			1
the mountains were the focus of friday 's search effort because police had found @entity24 's burned - out pickup truck a day earlier near the resort community			1
the truck had a broken axle , which would have prevented the vehicle from moving , and footprints appear to show that @entity24 doubled back into the community , said a source with knowledge of the investigation			1
it was unclear where @entity24 may have gone from there or by what means , the source said			1
but @entity11 told reporters friday : " the possibility exists that he is here , somewhere in the forest , so we 're going to keep looking ... until we determine that he 's not here			1

two inches of snow friday coated the mountaintop pine trees and roads around @entity0 , leading motorists to use tire chains			2

but the snow was regarded as a godsend because tracking a man on the run would be easier , authorities said			2

" residents were n't fearful , he said , adding that " many of the people here are armed			0
" " is there panic in our community ? " @entity106 asked reporters rhetorically			0
" no , there is no panic			0
we 're a hearty people in the @entity38			0
" @entity120 sheriff @entity119 said the snowfall slowed some searching done by foot , but police pushed onward			2
" the snow is great for tracking folks , as well as looking at each individual cabin to see if there 's any sign of forced entry , " @entity119 said			2
" we 're going to continue searching until we either discover he left the mountain or we find him , " he added			0
" it 's extremely dangerous			0
