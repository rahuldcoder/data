-- arch rivals @entity2 and @entity4 meet for the sixth time this season saturday in an @entity8 clash which is likely to decide the destination of the @entity11 title			1
reigning champions @entity2 will have home advantage at their @entity15 stadium , but trail real by four points with only five games remaining			1
a draw would leave @entity4 in pole position to reclaim the @entity21 crown after four years but assistant coach @entity22 said they would approach the heavyweight clash in positive fashion			1
" we will play the same way we did in our last three games at the @entity15			2
we did everything in our power in three different championships and gave good performances , " he told the official @entity4 website			2
@entity22 , once again fronting up to the media in the absence of his boss @entity37 , said that whatever the outcome his team were still in good position for ultimate success in the championship race			1
" i believe the three points at stake are important because there fewer games left in the competition			0
whatever the score , four games will remain and we 'll continue to work as naturally as we 've been doing so far			0
win , draw or lose , this team is doing a very good job this year and we will keep it up			0
@entity2 have cut into @entity4 's lead , which stood at 10 points just over a month ago , with draws against @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 holding up the pacesetters			1
by contrast , @entity59 's @entity2 have mounted a late charge with 11 straight @entity21 wins with @entity62 in free scoring form with 18 goals in that run			1
it has taken his personal tally to the season to a remarkable 63 in all competitions			0
fellow superstar @entity70 has also maintained his scoring streak for @entity4 , 53 for the season and tied with @entity62 in the battle for the ' @entity74 awarded to top striker in @entity21			1
it 's no wonder @entity59 believes the battle between the two might well decide the outcome of saturday 's showdown			0
" @entity62 and @entity70 feed off each other , they are apart from everyone else			0
we 're lucky to be afforded the chance to enjoy some great football players			0
they score when the team is playing well or when the team is playing poorly , " he told reporters			0
unusually , both teams go into the frenetic atmosphere of an @entity8 clash off the back of rare defeats			2
@entity4 lost 2 - 1 tuesday at @entity98 in the first leg of their @entity101 semifinal , while @entity2 suffered a 1 - 0 reverse at @entity105 's @entity104 stadium 24 hours later			1
they will be favorites to turn around the ties in their home legs to set up the possibility of a seventh @entity8 of the season in the final at @entity98 's @entity112 next month			1
@entity113 , the executive editor of @entity114 , told @entity0 that neither side was likely to be affected by the setbacks			0
" the extra day 's rest might be important ( for @entity4 ) but there were no serious injuries for either side and after all they both just lost by one goal , " he said			1
for now the focus will be on the league clash and the odds are against @entity37 , despite his incredible managerial record in four countries			2
since taking charge at the @entity129 in the summer of 2010 his team has only beaten @entity2 once in 10 attempts , the final of the @entity133 last season with @entity70 scoring the winner in extra time			1
@entity113 believes @entity37 will be making @entity21 success for his team a priority , even over the @entity101 crown			1
" @entity21 very definitely , " he said			0
" they want to get past this jinx and i would imagine if @entity37 achieved that he could move on to his next challenge , " he said			0
but his side will have to buck the form book			0
this season their @entity145 rivals have beaten them over two legs in the @entity149 and the quarterfinal of the @entity133 , again over two legs			0
a 3 - 1 league win for @entity2 in december in the @entity129 may also be a pointer			2
midfield star @entity154 scored in that win and will be making a record 32nd @entity8 appearance should he get on the pitch on saturday night .			2

@entity2 and @entity4 meet in @entity8 at the @entity15 on saturday
real four points clear of their arch - rivals in the @entity11 @entity21 title race
under @entity37 , @entity4 have beaten @entity2 just once in 10 attempts
both sides lost @entity101 semifinal first - leg ties in *midweek*
