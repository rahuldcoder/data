@entity0 -- the symbolic " @entity3 " scientists use to portray what they feel is the risk from nuclear holocaust has moved a minute closer to midnight			1
the @entity7 made the adjustment in reaction to an increased risk of weapons proliferation , the failure of a nuclear power plant in @entity14 , and terrorist threats to use " dirty bombs " with stolen atomic material			1
the clock was moved to five minutes before midnight after a symposium where experts presented their reasoning and risk assessment			2
it had been at six minutes before midnight since january 2010 , when scientists moved the hand back , reflecting a decreased risk of nuclear proliferation			1
" two years ago , it appeared that world leaders might address the truly global threats we face , " said @entity28 , who chairs the group 's science and security board			0
" in many cases , this trend has not continued or has been reversed			0
for that reason , the @entity7 is moving the clock one minute closer to midnight , back to it 's time in 2007			0
" the group , in announcing the decision tuesday at a news conference , said in a news release that one factor was the question of nuclear weapons management " in a world of increasing economic , political and environmental volatility			0
" nuclear weapons are one of several issues that determine the setting of the @entity3			2
atomic energy also contributed to the higher risk represented by moving the clock ahead one minute			1
but the group declined to take a position on the future viability of nuclear energy , just its existing threat to human survival , including the diversion of atomic material for weapons production			0
@entity66 , the group 's executive director , told reporters that even after more than 60 years of the scientists assessing nuclear risk , " it remains to be seen whether the safety and the proliferation risks can be addressed in a way that really is acceptable to people			2
" " management issues , rather than technical issues , seemed to have been the problem in @entity81 , " said @entity76 , who co-chairs an executive board with the @entity7			0
he said the disaster in @entity14 represented a broader political lack of will to ensure safe global energy			0
" the need to act is urgent , " he said , saying action also is needed against the factors scientists believe cause global warming			1
" climate change is happening , " @entity76 said , listing it among the risk factors in the @entity3 announcement			1
" it 's happening now , it 's measurable , and it 's clearly related to human activity , and the need to react becomes more urgent			0
" the @entity3 was established in 1947 by scientists who helped develop the first atomic weapons in the @entity102			1
the countdown to catastrophe has grown to reflect the risk to humanity and the planet not just from nuclear weapons , but also from a broad range of possible sources .			2

new : " the need to act is urgent " in a range of problem areas , one scientist says
the @entity3 moves ahead one minute
