the @entity8 , which supplies power to almost 9 million @entity15 , " has not fully implemented appropriate security practices to protect the control systems used to operate its critical infrastructures , " leaving them " vulnerable to disruption , " the @entity9 found			1

the @entity8 operates 52 nuclear , hydroelectric and fossil - fuel facilities in the southeastern @entity15			1
among the government watchdog agency findings : the @entity8 's firewalls have been bypassed or are inadequately configured passwords are not effective servers and work stations lack key patches and effective virus protection intrusion - detection systems are not adequate some locations lack enough physical security around control systems			2

" it is not acceptable			0
" he said the result is there is now no clear picture of how vulnerable utilities are to cyber attacks			1
the electric reliability corporation -- a nongovernmental group that oversees the power system and comprises members of the industry and some consumers -- told @entity1 it regrets the confusion			1
experts told @entity1 that @entity94 is the only manufacturer of hardware that can close the @entity56 vulnerability			0
the company estimated it would need to sell about 10,000 devices to fix the problem nationwide			0
it has sold just over 100 , it told @entity1			0
@entity21 said the federal government may need new powers to require utilities to take corrective actions to close cyber security gaps , and he will press to give those powers to the @entity107			2
