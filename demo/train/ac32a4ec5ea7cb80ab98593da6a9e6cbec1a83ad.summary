-- the cruise - line industry is a rough business			1
every time a passenger ship leaves port with a guest cabin unoccupied , that 's money the cruise operators are never going to see			1
last week @entity8 , the longtime chief executive of @entity9 , announced that he will be stepping down ; revenues at the world 's largest cruise - ship line have been falling			1
@entity8 will remain as chairman of the firm , but a new ceo will step in			0
@entity17 companies have always had to contend with uncertainties in the economy , which sometimes make travelers cautious about planning leisure trips , and @entity9 has faced widespread unpleasant publicity in recent years			0
the @entity23 , owned by a subsidiary of the corporation , ran aground and partially sank off the coast of @entity27 in 2012 , killing 32 people			0
this year the @entity29 lost power in the @entity31 after a fire in the engine room , creating distressing conditions onboard for its more than 3,000 passengers			1
the very nature of the cruise business -- the relentless competition between various lines , the need to fill those staterooms , a fickle public with a multiplicity of options for how and where to vacation -- might cause sleepless nights for executives , but for certain people , it provides a dream scenario : a seldom - considered way to live the ultimate beach - bum fantasy , 21st - century style			1
it 's not for everyone			1
you need to , at least temporarily , have unlimited time on your hands , and you need to have saved , or come upon , some money that you wo n't one day regret using up this way			1
and a desire , at least once during your time on @entity61 , to live your life as if it 's a @entity63 song			1
a few years back , i was on a cruise ship after a week at sea with the @entity67 , the band with whom i occasionally travel and sing			1
most of the passengers , on that final morning , were harried and tense about gathering up all their baggage and making the jarring reentry to the mundane real world			0
but in a lounge area of the ship , one man sat near us as he waited for his debarkation group to be called			1
he seemed as serene and calmly blissful as if he was just getting ready to start a cruise , not end one			2
that 's because he was			2
the way he explained it to us , he had parted company with the corporation that employed him ; we got the impression that this was not voluntary on his part			0
he had been given some severance			0
so , he told us , he had figured out a way , for a relatively small amount of money , to live , for a while , like a king			2
like a sultan at sea			0
he was now , he said , residing virtually full - time on cruise ships -- eating gourmet meals , lounging in the sun , listening to music and going to stage shows at night , sleeping in freshly made - up beds with the oceans of the world lulling him to sleep			1
how could he do this ? each week , he explained , he 'd get on his computer and do searches for cheap , last - minute cruise deals			1
there are websites that specialize in exactly that			0
he was counting on the need of all those cruise lines to fill every cabin -- he was counting on their willingness to do just about anything to get rid of their inventory ( the unoccupied rooms ) as their ships were about to sail			1
he said that , by waiting until the last minute , and by not particularly caring where the ship with the best bargain was heading , he was able to find astonishing rates			2
the ship upon which we were talking had been sailing the @entity130 for a week			0
i believe he told us that the seven - day cruise , with all meals included , had cost him , as the clock ticked down and the rock - bottom price popped up , a little more than $ 300			1
there is no way , on dry land , that you can eat a week of extravagant multi-course dinners in fine restaurants for $ 300 -- much less get living quarters , entertainment , recreation and all your other meals , too			2
that winter , he said , he 'd made the decision to base himself in the @entity148 , @entity149 , area , near the massive @entity151 seaport			0
occasionally he would have to pay for a night or two in a budget hotel before the next ship left , but his goal was to get off one ship , wait a few hours , and get right back on another			0
and , while at sea , get on the internet and search for the next bargain			0
for many people , a cruise is a once - in - a - lifetime treat			1
he had figured out how to make it his everyday world			0
you do n't get to plan in advance and choose exactly where you want to go			0
but if you do it every week , do you really care if , on a particular week , one of the ports of call is @entity173 instead of @entity174 ? the @entity175 instead of @entity176 ? it does n't matter -- for you , it 's all travel roulette			2
the downside -- and it 's a huge one -- is that you are cast adrift in many ways			1
eventually , when your money runs out , you are going to have to think about rejoining the world of ambition and ladder - climbing , and trying to make up for lost time			1
you have to be the kind of person who can be content with the thought that you are accomplishing and accruing absolutely nothing while other people , back on land , are applying for jobs and working for promotions that will bring them financial security			0
you have to be comfortable in the company of complete strangers , who materialize and then disappear week - by - week			2
you ca n't be a person with a family who is expecting you at the dinner table back home			0
and , although you do n't have to be trust - fund wealthy , you have to somehow have $ 400 or $ 500 a week on hand , for weeks on end			2
but the opportunity , for a particular kind of person , is there			0
the modern - day combination of a vast cruise industry , and an internet that makes finding 11th - hour bargains effortless , means that you can , for as long as you are able to get away with it , indulge yourself in an endless summer , letting rootlessness be a virtue			1
probably very few people reading these words will find themselves in a position , or a frame of mind , to do it , but maybe , the next time the cubicle culture begins to feel too confining , just the thought of it will bring a smile			2
on gray days , it has for me			0
i 've thought , from time to time , of that guy on the ship , and wondered how long he was able to make it last			2
or whether it became a case of too much ice cream -- if he ended up deciding that the long meal of life was not meant to be an infinite succession of desserts			0
and whether a fellow like @entity8 , the head of @entity9 , with all of the job 's challenges and headaches , ever daydreams of being that guy instead			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity245 .			1

@entity245 : on a cruise , if a guest cabin goes unoccupied , that 's money that 's lost
@entity245 met a man who was living virtually full - time on cruise ships at rock bottom rates
he was living the ultimate beach - bum fantasy , 21st - century style , @entity245 says
@entity245 : the downside is that you are cast adrift in many ways
