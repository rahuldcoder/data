-- usually when we talk about the @entity2 in @entity3 we focus on two men -- @entity5 and @entity6 -- and rightfully so			0
they are the two with an undeniable impact on history , albeit in vastly different ways			0
but in light of president @entity14 's recent remarks on " @entity15 " denouncing @entity17 's new anti-gay laws , laws that have led to bloodshed in the streets , it is important that we remember @entity20 and @entity21			1
they too were at those games			0
they too left a mark			0
you see , the day before they were scheduled to run in the 400 - meter relay , their coach , @entity27 , replaced them			0
they did not break any team rules nor were they disqualified for any violations			0
they were , however , @entity38 , and this was @entity40 , which had adopted the @entity42 laws limiting @entity38 citizens ' rights a year earlier			1
apparently , @entity27 , along with leaders from the @entity46 , decided it would be best if @entity20 and @entity21 did not compete			0
at the time i 'm sure it seemed like a decision that would only hurt the two men			0
after all , the 400 , led by @entity6 , still won gold			0
today we look at that decision and lower our heads in shame , understanding that it made us complicit with something that evolved into a far worse crime than unjustly replacing a pair of sprinters			0
in the moment when we should have spoken up , we remained silent			0
and so here we are again : an @entity64 on the horizon , another host country with recently legislated laws persecuting a group of people , and for a while , we were silent			1
" i 've been very clear that when it comes to universal rights , when it comes to people 's basic freedoms , that whether you are discriminating on the basis of race , religion , gender or sexual orientation , you are violating the basic morality that i think should transcend every country , " @entity14 said , going on to talk about how @entity17 's treatment of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people goes against the spirit of the @entity64			1
he did not call for a boycott			0
but on wednesday he canceled a one - on - one meeting with @entity17 president @entity92 planned for september			2
the @entity93 cited @entity17 's decision to grant asylum to @entity97 leaker @entity96 and " lack of progress on issues such as missile defense and arms control " among other reasons			2
but it also mentioned human rights issues			0
recently , @entity107 secretary of state @entity106 received a letter from 88 members of @entity110 -- republicans and @entity112 -- urging him to do something to guarantee the safety of @entity115 @entity107 visiting @entity17 during that time			1
that leaves 447 lawmakers we should be asking why they did not sign that letter			2
last month @entity119 provided the world photos of @entity115 people being violently beaten by anti-gay protesters and police in @entity17			1
there are reports of @entity115 teens being kidnapped , bullied , tortured and killed			1
@entity17 officials have said they do n't condone the attacks , but police have stood by while they happened and then arrested the battered victims for being gay			2
and because it is unclear whether or not the anti-gay laws will be enforced during the @entity64 , the safety of all @entity107 -- because you can be arrested if police think you look gay or even if you support gays -- is in question			1
which brings me to : why are n't the names of all 535 members of @entity110 on that letter ? in talking about the @entity2 , i do not equate what is happening in @entity17 to what happened to @entity38 people during @entity146 i just want to remind you that the @entity148 did not happen overnight			1
these new anti-gay laws are disturbingly similar to the anti-semitic @entity42 laws @entity5 passed before the @entity2			1
and with the @entity154 finding 84 % of @entity17 believe society should reject gay people , perhaps some saying they object to gays for fear of arrest , the world should question how far @entity17 intends to go			2
we should question how far @entity17 , our lukewarm ally , intends to go and what our participation in the 2014 @entity64 will look like generations from now			1
in one of his final interviews before passing away in 2001 , @entity20 told the @entity168 that there had been some talk of boycotting the @entity2 because of @entity5 , but no one foresaw what would happen to the @entity38 a short time later			2
" there is no way in the world that i would think of going to @entity40 , " he said			2
" the @entity148 and those things around @entity40 which we all loathe were n't in existence in 1936			1
" no one can predict the future			0
but this week @entity14 showed he learned an important lesson from our @entity64 past -- offering silence to appease evil is a senseless endeavor because evil will never be satisfied			2
now it 's our turn to speak up			0
there are 447 members of @entity110 who have yet to sign that letter to @entity106 -- we need to be asking why			1
photos : wrecking homes for an @entity64 highway the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			1

two @entity38 sprinters from @entity107 kept from running in @entity40 in 1936 @entity64
@entity196 : the @entity200 taking place in @entity17 with its *extreme* anti-gay laws
in @entity17 , @entity115 teens reportedly being kidnapped , bullied , even killed , he says
all of @entity110 should sign letter for @entity17 to ensure @entity115 @entity107 ' safety , he says
