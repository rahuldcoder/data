@entity0 -- supporting a congressional campaign usually means donating money , knocking on doors and making phone calls			2
rarely does it mean acting like a nudist in a television ad that will be played throughout your community			0
that is , until the @entity12 for @entity14 campaign asked exactly that from their supporters			1
@entity12 , a @entity18 running to oust @entity20 @entity19 rep. @entity19 , released an ad on thursday that featured a handful of seemingly naked people urging viewers to support the @entity18 in november 's election			1
the people in the ad , however , are not actual nudists			2
they are supporters of the @entity12 campaign who agreed to appear on tv with different objects in front of their naked bits			1
" they are volunteers who agreed to do it because they support our campaign and our message , " said @entity35 , the @entity36 campaign manager			2
" it should also be noted that nobody was actually nude during filming			0
" according to @entity35 , " it was a pretty easy sell to all of our volunteers , " even though the ad -- which comes with a " high five figure ( cost ) behind it " -- will be seen on cable and broadcast in the @entity54 market starting friday			0
the ( faux ) nudity in the ad -- titled " @entity58 " -- was a knock on @entity19 , who in 2011 skinny dipped in the @entity60 in @entity61 , a decision for which he was reprimanded by @entity65 in 2012			1
" awhile back , congressman @entity19 made news by skinny dipping on the job , " @entity12 says in the ad			1
" but it is more shameless what he is doing to @entity20			0
" the ad then features the seemingly naked volunteers citing different aspects of @entity19 's record , including that " @entity19 lines the pockets of his millionaire donors with big tax cuts			1
and they line his , when he has pockets			0
" " we thought it was a humorous hook , " @entity35 said , " to get people to pay attention to the message			0

@entity12 for @entity14 campaign releases an ad with folks seemingly naked
the people were not nudists or actors ; they were supporters of the campaign
" it should also be noted that nobody was actually nude during filming , " says campaign manager
@entity12 's *opponent* -- rep. @entity19 -- was reprimanded in 2012 for skinny dipping on a trip
