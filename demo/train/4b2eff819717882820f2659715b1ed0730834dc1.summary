-- just over a week ago , they were two little boys living with their grandparents and the family dog , @entity4 , in @entity5 , @entity6			1
first , police say @entity10 and @entity11 's father broke into the home and tied up the boys ' grandmother before whisking the two children away -- one day after he and the boys ' mother officially lost their parental rights			2
the 2 - and 4 - year - old boys ended up sailing to @entity20 with their parents , triggering an international manhunt that ended this week			1
@entity10 and @entity11 are now back in @entity5 , trying to resume their life with @entity4 and their grandparents			1
" right now , we 're just looking forward to sitting , getting them in our arms , hugging them and being with them and getting them home where they will be safe again , " the boy 's maternal grandfather , @entity26 , said overnight tuesday , just hours before being reunited with the boys			1
the boys ' mother and father , meanwhile , could be calling prison home for some time			2
@entity41 and @entity42 spent most of wednesday in @entity43			0
they 're set to make their first court appearance thursday morning , on charges of kidnapping , auto theft and child neglect			2
@entity51 faces an additional charge of false imprisonment			1
@entity6 abduction : a libertarian washed ashore in the worker 's paradise given @entity6 sentencing guidelines , a conviction on the kidnapping charges alone could mean the @entity61 will spend the rest of their life behind bars			1
police : parents talked of ' journey to the @entity68 ' the @entity70 ' ordeal began last june when @entity41 and @entity42 and the their two sons were staying together in a hotel in @entity73 , @entity74			1
responding to a call , police officers found the parents " acting in a bizarre manner , " @entity73 police said in a statement			0
inside the room were their two boys , as well as narcotics and weapons			0
" they were talking about ' completing their ultimate journey ' and were traveling across the country to ' take a journey to the @entity68 ' , " police said about @entity41 and @entity42			0
@entity74 authorities took @entity10 and @entity11 from their parents following that incident			2
about two weeks later , their father showed up at a foster family home " with a firearm demanding the return of his children , " @entity73 police said			0
@entity51 fled after the foster parents called 911			1
over the subsequent months , @entity41 and @entity42 " did not participate in the system , " @entity98 , @entity6 , sheriff @entity99 said late tuesday , without offering much detail			2
" as a result of that , the authorities in @entity74 gave custody to the grandparents , " the sheriff added			1
that transfer became official april 2 , when a @entity74 judge terminated @entity41 and @entity42 's parental rights			0
the next day , at 6:30 a.m. , @entity109 told police that @entity51 saw his boys once again -- when he entered her @entity6 home , tied her up , then sped away with @entity10 , @entity11 and the family dog in a silver 2009 @entity114			1
they met up with @entity42 , who was waiting in a pickup truck , sheriff 's investigators said			0
they drove to a parking garage , and eventually ended up on a 25 - foot sailboat named @entity122			1
@entity51 had purchased that boat from a person , who later tipped off authorities after word got out about the brothers ' abduction			1
that 's the boat they took south -- leaving their @entity6 port just ahead of a storm that challenged authorities looking for them			2
" a small boat in a big ocean , it 's really tough , " @entity99 said			0
it was at the @entity139 , on tuesday , that @entity0 found the family -- hunkered inside the boat , under the watch of @entity20 security forces			1
that morning , @entity145 officials in @entity146 told @entity0 that they were afraid @entity11 and @entity10 could be in danger from their parents			0
armed @entity20 security agents , meanwhile , watched over the @entity150 most of the day -- until the family was led away , peacefully , that afternoon			2
boys ' ' fine , happy and sleepy ' on return to @entity145 @entity20 and the @entity145 are divided by far more than the @entity154			1
but this week , on this case , @entity145 officials repeatedly expressed their appreciation for the @entity20 government 's " extensive cooperation			2
" the @entity20 foreign ministry said the @entity70 ' boat pulled into a marina just west of @entity146 in bad weather on sunday			1
" from the first moment , " the two governments began exchanging information			0
to that point , @entity168 spokesman @entity167 said the @entity170 learned about the @entity11 family 's whereabouts from @entity20 authorities			1
that all led to the return of @entity176 , and the family dog , to the @entity145			0
but this time , they flew -- and were accompanied by @entity43 detectives , as well as @entity145 federal and state law enforcement authorities			0
@entity145 diplomatic officials waited with the family at @entity146 's airport until a plane carrying @entity145 law enforcement officials arrived to bring them all back to @entity6			0
checked out by a medic , @entity10 and @entity11 were " fine , happy and sleepy " as they boarded the plane , the sheriff 's office said			0
the aircraft touched down around 1:30 a.m. wednesday at @entity192			0
some time later , the boys and dog were reunited with the grandparents			2
their parents , no longer on the lam , are being held away from the general population of the @entity6 jail			0
