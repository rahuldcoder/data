-- it is no secret that president @entity3 is in a tough fight for re-election			1
he is correct in describing himself as the underdog at the present time			2
in an atmosphere of high unemployment , declining incomes , and worldwide financial angst you would be correct in thinking that the @entity13 are on the verge of having another big year			1
in order for the president to win this go - round it is essential that he faces a weak @entity13 opponent			1
this opponent would undoubtedly emerge from an equally weak @entity13 field			1
thus far the @entity13 field of 2012 is a @entity24 dream come true			1
this crop of candidates is not just weak , it is a joke			1
now you are saying , " there goes that crazy @entity29 again calling the opposition a joke			1
" i can hear the men in wool sport coats with suede elbow patches scratching their chins			2
there is a collective harrumph from the " it 's time to tone down the rhetoric " crowd of people			1
before you condemn my rather provocative adjective in describing the @entity13 field , please consider the following : 1			1
it is undeniably the duty of the opposition party to field a credible slate of candidates for the nation 's highest office			1
it is particularly important that they do so in times of national distress ( and this certainly qualifies as such )			1
this situation in modern times is most analogous to the presidential primaries of 1980			1
to justify my deeming the @entity13 field an absolute joke i have compiled a list of comparable candidates for your reading pleasure			1
this battle of @entity68 © s proves incredibly entertaining -- feel free to indulge			2
lets start at the top by matching up the front - runners : @entity72 vs. @entity73 -- please hold your laughter because it 's only getting funnier from here on out			1
@entity73 stepped up as two - time governor of @entity79 who came within an inch of the nomination in 1976			2
he gave the keynote address at the @entity13 convention of 1964 and was a longtime consistent conservative for years prior to his running for president for the second time in 1980			1
@entity72 is an accomodationist technocrat who is an ideological pretzel of a man			2
in his four years as governor , @entity89 ranked 49th in job creation and @entity92 saved him from coming in at 50			2
but hey -- @entity72 has recently released a 59 - point economic plan for recovery			2
go ahead and name three of those 59 points -- see , told ya so			0
i have no idea why that right - wing clown in @entity100 is attacking his @entity102 faith -- it may be the only thing he really believes in			0
this one is delicious -- @entity108 vs. @entity109			0
i 'm sorry , but @entity108 is @entity110 on steroids			0
to be clear , @entity110 was actually a pretty damn good lawyer who has some intellectual heft to him -- although he hid it rather well in his 2008 race			0
on the contrary , @entity108 literally ca n't string two sentences together			0
his performance before the @entity118 was universally panned			0
@entity108 could n't give a good speech with all the time in the world to prepare			0
we are now told the problem is that he does n't get enough sleep			0
break out the @entity124 -- @entity108 is coming storming back ! note to the @entity108 campaign : you are supposed to give him the @entity124 after the debate , not before			0
i know @entity108 speaks some @entity129 but i do n't believe " debate " translates to " siesta			0
" @entity109 was a war hero , a successful entrepreneur , director of the @entity133 , ambassador to the @entity135 , @entity137 envoy to @entity138 , and chairman of the @entity140			0
@entity109 went on to serve as vice president and president of the @entity137			1
sorry , @entity108 , i do n't see you filling those shoes anytime soon			0
let 's match up @entity146 vs @entity147			1
like @entity109 , @entity147 was a war hero , a member of the @entity148 , elected to the @entity137 @entity148 , became a senator , was selected as a vice-presidential running mate , and chaired the @entity140			0
he later went on to serve as chairman of the @entity152 , @entity152 majority leader , and @entity152 minority leader			0
@entity146 ca n't even make an edible pizza			0
@entity13 or not -- you have to admit , that stuff was pretty bad			1
moving on to @entity158 vs. @entity159 ( i 'm sorry i could n't help myself			0
) @entity159 served in the @entity160 , was elected to the @entity152 , was asked to serve on the @entity161 by @entity162 , and served two terms as @entity152 minority leader			0
he later received the @entity164 and inspired the formation of the @entity166 at the @entity167			0
could you see @entity158 being nominated for a @entity169 in the near future ? ! of course , some people might say , to be fair to @entity158 , @entity159 has never claimed to cure anyone of homosexuality			0
i have n't even spoken of former governor of @entity176 @entity175 who , unlike @entity108 , served as a competent governor , served as both secretary of the navy and secretary of the treasury			0
even i am getting tired of beating this @entity180 of a field			1
the other @entity13 of the presidential primaries of 1980 consisted of sen. @entity183 of @entity184 , who was a liberal @entity13 and a rather influential member of the @entity186 ( for those of you over 45 you can remember such a species			1
) @entity190 , selected as a third - party candidate , went on to gain a significant number of votes in the general election			0
@entity195 , a well - respected @entity13 , was thought to be an articulate promoter of conservative ideology			1
@entity198 would fit in nicely with the current crop of underwhelming candidates sure to disappoint			2
@entity201 , the former ambassador to @entity202 , was said to be the first @entity203 to run for president			2
he has escaped my memory much like i 'm sure @entity206 has escaped your memory by now as well ( let the @entity209 )			0
the two most qualified candidates , @entity211 and @entity212 , ca n't even get their own party to take them seriously			2
@entity212 's career can be compared to @entity183 's unsuccessful quest for a presidential nomination			2
@entity218 's public ethical issues have made him a presidential outcast			2
regardless , these three are notoriously marked by their inability to get votes ( in their favor that is			0
) i 'll conclude by saying that it may not be appropriate to refer to the @entity13 slate as a joke			1
i 'm sorry i take it back -- they are , more fittingly , pathetic			0
in times like this there is nothing wrong with the nation having a good laugh , just as long as it 's not at the expense of a major political party			1
the 1980 field in comparison to 2012 reminds me of the recent @entity239 vs. @entity241 game			1
not to rub it in but the score was @entity239 41 - @entity241 11			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity246 .			1

@entity246 : to win , president @entity3 needs a weak @entity13 opponent
he says the @entity13 are obliging dems by putting up a weak field
comparison with 1980 's slate shows real gap in qualifications , he says
@entity246 : in *difficult* times , it 's vital for opposition to put up credible candidates
