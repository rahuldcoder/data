an untold number of unwed women in @entity1 were forced to give up their children for adoption over decades during the 20th century			1

addressing those ripped from their families , she said : " to each of you who were adopted or removed , who were led to believe your mother had rejected you , and who were denied the opportunity to grow up with your family and community of origin , and to connect with your culture , we say sorry			0
" @entity0 's comments came about a year after a @entity37 committee that investigated forced adoptions released its report , which included a recommendation for a national apology			1
the report found that some mothers signed adoption papers while under the influence of medication			2
others were not advised of government payments that may have been available to them			0
" most common of all was the bullying arrogance of a society that presumed to know what was best , " @entity0 said			2
the report estimated there were 140,000 to 150,000 adoptions between 1951 and 1975 , and as many as 250,000 from 1940 onward			0
