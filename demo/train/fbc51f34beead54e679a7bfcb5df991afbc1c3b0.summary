-- price of gas got you crying at the pump ? is it eating into your household budget ? well , get used to it			1
gas in @entity8 , the second worst state , hits $ 4.59 per gallon for regular unleaded in this july 14 photo			1
that 's the word on the streets as the price of a gallon of gasoline soars to record highs			1
with regional differentials pushing the price much higher in some places , drivers and small - business owners are finding it hard to cope			2
but which states ' motorists get the best deal , and in which states do drivers pay the most to fill - up ? here come the numbers @entity30 has the highest gas prices in the nation , with a gallon of regular gasoline at $ 4.623 , followed by @entity8 at $ 4.583 as of june 30			1
@entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 make up the top five states with highest prices , with @entity40 and @entity37 not far behind at $ 4.292 and $ 4.160 respectively			1
best states to buy gas ? @entity43 comes out top at $ 3.862 for a gallon of regular , followed by @entity46 at $ 3.866 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			1
@entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 are next in line			0
@entity54 autos : cars with 30 + @entity56 for $ 300 or less per month past prices we use the term ' best states to buy gas ' with this caveat : back in june 2004 , gas hovered at around $ 1.74 a gallon , according to figures from @entity65			1
@entity66 , @entity68 's fuel price analyst , said the primary reasons for rising fuel prices are an increase in demand for petroleum products across the globe and a need for investment in refining infrastructure			1
" right now , it is almost impossible to know where oil and gas prices will be in six months to a year , " he said			1
" it 's easy to assume that the world economy will continue to grow , we are very clearly at risk of an economic downturn and perhaps a severe economic downturn which could influence the demand side to the point where oil and gas prices may drop			1
" in 10 to 20 years out , oil and gasoline will continue to be more expensive			2
but given what 's happening in the markets right now , there is some potential that [ the ] demands side of the equation could fall off a cliff			0
" @entity54 autos : consumer reports on best fuel - efficient used cars why so expensive in @entity8 ? @entity103 , spokeswoman for the @entity104 , says the primary reason behind the high price of gas in @entity8 is " market segmentation , " a marketing term that basically means @entity8 ( along with many other states ) has developed a " boutique blend " of fuel in a bid to uphold environmental or ecological standards			1
in @entity8 's case , this blend helps clear the state 's notorious smog			2
" we ca n't use gas they made for @entity50			2
we use a special blend with additives in it , an ethanol mix , " @entity122 said			0
" when you do that , you can only use refineries that make that gas [ mix ]			2
the refineries in @entity8 are a major supplier , but , when prices are high and there 's not another supplier , we have to go where they make that mix. " she pointed out that refineries in @entity139 and @entity37 produce the gas product , and there is a pipeline to @entity30 , but that the only other options are shipping in the blend from elsewhere in the nation or @entity146 , which is not cost - efficient			1
" people have to figure out how to deal with this on a long - term basis			0
we 've been telling motorists to carpool and here we are in summer , and prices have barely come down , " she said			2
" usually we 're about a month into a downturn , it 's cyclical : prices go up in spring and spike in may , which is n't happening this year			2
prices may not come down a lot			0
" less misery in @entity43 @entity159 , vice president of public affairs for @entity161 , said his state is usually among the top three in terms of low gas prices			1
a contributing factor , he said , is that the state 's per - gallon tax rate is the lowest in the nation			1
he said that most , if not all , states impose a tax on gasoline but few are as low as the 17 cents a gallon @entity43 levies			1
and @entity43 , unlike most other states , does n't impose a sales tax on top of that			1
the state also benefits from good distribution via a crisscrossing network of pipelines which can , unusually , result in cheaper gas in rural areas than in major cities			1
the reason for this is the three types of gas used in the state			1
@entity191 primarily uses reformulated gasoline			0
conventional gas is sold in rural areas , and @entity195 uses low @entity196 ( or low - emission ) gasoline			2
reformulated costs more than conventional gas , hence the higher cost in cities			0
" in @entity204 , it 's not unusual to save 15 cents a gallon by crossing the river , " @entity159 said			0
@entity54 autos : best hybrid @entity208 effects on station owners and operators while the effects of soaring pump prices on consumers are well documented , owners and operators of service stations nationwide are also feeling the pain acutely			0
@entity220 , the executive director of the 135 - year - old @entity221 and @entity222 and owner of a service station in @entity225 , @entity8 , said high prices are " extremely detrimental to business people			2
what it does is creates a financial hardship on customers , [ leading to ] less foot traffic to stores or repair facilities			0
it puts a strain on entire businesses ; unbranded service stations are really at the end of their rope			0
" independent , unbranded stations have one retail philosophy : offer the best price			0
they rely on oversupply by refineries which they buy at wholesale prices and sell cheaper than the branded competition , like @entity250 or @entity251 ( which have both announced they are quitting the service - station industry )			0
but in the past six months , that supply curve has become inverted , which means owner - operators are paying more -- $ 37,000 a truckload -- for their gas than branded outlets			2
@entity220 noted some are losing as much as 15 cents a gallon on every sale			0
it 's a hard time for the industry , he said			0
the blame for high oil prices is pretty evenly spread , @entity220 said			2
he did , however , point out that as a result of higher gas prices , @entity8 brought in $ 4.4 billion last year in sales taxes from its monthly sales of 1,300,000,000 gallons			1
in 2002 , when gas prices averaged about $ 1.71 a gallon , it brought in $ 1.7 billion			1
@entity273 advocates boosting refinery capacity from its current level of 88 percent to about 92 percent			0
he said refineries " have their hands on the spigot			0
there is no shortage of crude			0
but if the government stepped up refinery capacity , that would put enough downward pressure to create competition among refineries			0
and my guys are going under			0
