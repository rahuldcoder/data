-- world number one @entity1 began his bid to win a second @entity5 title with a straight sets victory as he focused hard on avoiding a shock @entity9 - style defeat			1
a day after the @entity10 bowed out against @entity12 world no. 135 @entity13 , the @entity14 was in unforgiving mood as he defeated @entity17 's @entity16 6 - 3 7 - 5 6 - 4			1
@entity1 was playing his first match since losing a thrilling five - set semifinal at the @entity20 against @entity9 , who went on to win the tournament for a record eighth time			1
" i watched the bigger part of ( the @entity25 ) match and i thought that his opponent played great , " @entity1 said			1
" @entity13 came up with some incredible shots , incredible points in important moments and he deserved to win			0
" i know people expect all the top players to get to at least the final stages of a grand slam or whatever tournament they play			0
it was a surprise in the end him losing to @entity13 , but his opponent played great			0
" having been seeded in the opposite section of the draw , @entity1 would have been unable to meet @entity9 until the final itself but now his main rivals would appear to be either @entity5 maestro @entity43 , the defending champion , or local favorite @entity45			1
yet @entity1 is refusing to look so far ahead as he says the early rounds of grand slams can be very testing for the world 's leading players			1
" you can not take anything or anybody for granted			0
you have to be grateful for being in this position and work even harder to stay there , " said the 2011 @entity5 champion			2
" the sport is evolving , like everything in life			0
everybody is getting better , getting more professional			0
" especially at the opening stages of grand slams , there are a lot of quality players who have nothing to lose really coming on the @entity67 or @entity68 , playing in front of 10,000 or more people			0
" against one of the top players , what can you really lose ? you 're going and you 're playing your best tennis			0
" @entity1 had taken a risk ahead of the championships by failing to play any competitive matches on grass but he gave a convincing display against a player whose game , the @entity14 says , is " suited to grass "			2
bidding for a seventh grand slam , @entity1 will now meet @entity85 @entity84 in the second round			2
the @entity14 is in the same half of the draw as @entity89 , the @entity91 fourth seed who lost his first grand slam final to @entity9 last month			0
a master of clay , @entity89 had to adapt to the @entity5 surface as he beat @entity5 debutant @entity97 of @entity98 in four sets			1
" it is difficult to play on grass for my game , " said @entity89			0
" it is very difficult to defend			0
i am happy because i am in the second round but i know that i have to improve my game			0
" in other matches on tuesday , seven seed @entity104 eased through in straight sets against @entity108 in what is the @entity111 's 40th straight appearance at a grand slam			1
@entity17 's @entity113 , a quarterfinalist at @entity20 , overcame @entity115 while @entity116 beat @entity117 in straight sets			1
elsewhere , @entity120 's @entity119 defeated @entity85 21st seed @entity121 before making an impassioned plea for his controversial father to be allowed entry to @entity5			1
@entity119 's father has been barred from attending by @entity5 authorities after an incident involving his son 's doubles partner @entity128 in may , with security guards having been told to deny @entity132 entry even if he buys a ticket			1
@entity119 wants @entity5 and the @entity134 ( @entity134 ) to overturn the suspension imposed after @entity132 was accused of headbutting @entity128 on the streets of @entity137			1
the ban is ongoing at all @entity134 events until the case reaches its conclusion , with @entity119 set to face a @entity137 court in october , and his 20 - year - old son is now missing both his father and coach			1
" all of a sudden not to have someone there who 's been there for you your whole life is very difficult			2
it 's not a good feeling			2
it 's tough , " said @entity119 , whose father is staying with him in south @entity154			1
" i 'll try and have a word with ( the @entity5 authorities )			2
i know they are very strict here			0
we 'll see what they say			0
it would be amazing to have my dad here watching me as a coach and a father			0
" @entity132 has claimed self - defense for his actions .			2

world number one @entity1 beats @entity17 's @entity16 in straight sets
@entity104 and @entity172 also *comfortably* through
