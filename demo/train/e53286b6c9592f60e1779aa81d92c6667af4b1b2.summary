-- imagine this : it 's a gorgeous spring day in @entity3 and you 're thoroughly tempted to lower the top of your rental car and push the power pedal a little too hard in a bid to break free from the traffic crush on the @entity11			1
but , though there may not seem to be a heavy police presence on the freeways on this particular day , you can be pretty sure that someone up in the sky is keeping a close eye on speeding vacationers and the massive traffic tailbacks they 're trying to avoid			1
welcome to @entity21 and aviation law enforcement from the state 's @entity23			1
it 's one of the few states in the @entity27 that employs aircraft to monitor speeders , reckless drivers and , sometimes , soon - to - be felons fleeing a police pursuit ( @entity33 and @entity34 are among a dozen others )			1
and if you never quite realized what those strange white lines along the side of the highway mean , well , now you will			0
flight captain @entity40 , the @entity41 's chief pilot , says his job primarily involves monitoring motorists ' speed between these painted white lines , which are placed a quarter - mile apart in frequent intervals			1
how it works surprisingly , aviation enforcement does n't involve radar : it 's a straightforward stopwatch time over distance equation that allows a pilot to work out whether a driver has broken the speed limit			1
captain @entity40 , having clocked a motorist driving too fast , then radios the speeding car 's information to a waiting state trooper , or ground unit , who stops the car and issues a citation			1
@entity61 autos : how to avoid a speeding ticket that is , if the driver stops			1
sometimes , @entity40 says , they do n't , a felony offense			1
but this is where aviation enforcement really comes into its own			1
in certain cases , rather than pursuing a fleeing motorist , which can be dangerous for all involved , an order will be given for the troopers to stand down but the pilot will still pursue the driver			0
occasionally , the driver will head home , or even go shopping , completely unaware that his movements have been tracked from the air			0
planes , after all , operate much more quietly than the helicopters often employed in other states in such pursuits			2
when the driver is quickly apprehended on the ground , usually they 're shocked to hear they 'd been tracked from high above			2
" the troopers will back off and we 'll follow the vehicle , " @entity40 said			0
" when the person does n't see the troopers ' lights , he 'll pull off and stop or he 'll drive to his house			2
and as he 's going into his house , the troopers are coming around the corner			2
" it takes the fleeing portion out of the pursuit			0
sometimes he 'll still drive recklessly but the majority of the time he 'll operate within speed limits if he thinks nobody is chasing him			2
" @entity61 autos : caught at 100 mph -- now what ? @entity40 says that a fleet of seven @entity109 fixed - wing aircraft operates in the skies above @entity21			2
the combined fleet delivers some 45,000 citations on average each year , and speed will be a factor in about 38,000 of these citations			0
the rest of the citations are made up of secondary factors , if the driver is drunk or not wearing a seatbelt , for example , or is driving on a suspended license			0
he says about 150 arrests are made each year where a pilot has spotted a clearly impaired driver , and aircraft enforcement results in the recovery of about 50 stolen vehicles annually			1
@entity61 autos : worst states for drunk driving " the primary use of aircraft is for traffic enforcement , " @entity40 said			1
" the pilot has a stopwatch and observes traffic going down the roadway			2
he activates the stopwatch on the first line and calculates the average speed over the quarter mile			2
@entity61 autos : how police catch you speeding " we 'll say , ' the vehicle is a red pickup truck in the inside lane , number 5 behind you , off to your left now , now he 's number 1			1
the trooper looks out his window and will pull in behind that vehicle			2
we confirm the time and speed and the pilot will return to the lines and do it over again			2
" impact of weather the most challenging days for @entity40 and his team of pilots are busy holidays with heavy traffic and when the weather takes a turn for the worse			0
he says in those situations , or when a storm is looming , the fleet will be grounded			0
" we do not fly in inclement weather , " he says			0
@entity40 , who was born and raised in @entity21 , says that any prospective pilot must have logged at least one year as a regular state trooper and 500 hours of flight time and gained a commercial or instrument rating			1
he says many pilots were former civilian fliers who paid for their lessons out of their own pocket , although they can gain the qualification when they 're going through the police training academy			0
@entity40 was a trooper for five years before he took to the skies , and now spends about five hours a day in the air			0
he also has to testify in court should a motorist decide to challenge a citation			0
@entity189 , a defense lawyer at @entity190 , has gotten to know many of the @entity41 pilots well in his long career fighting speeding tickets in @entity21 courts			1
he says he has won many cases challenging the basic equipment used to issue a citation -- including radio and the three stopwatches that pilots may use to clock a vehicle -- and discrepancies in the timing of an issued ticket			1
@entity61 autos : how to fight a speeding ticket he says that a pilot must prove that their stopwatches -- which must be of a certain brand -- have been calibrated in the last six months			0
he says a description of the car , its time and its speed must be written on the ticket , and that the citation 's reliability must be proven beyond reasonable doubt			1
which means that if there is a discrepancy between the time a pilot says he contacted the trooper and the time the trooper wrote on the ticket , even by a minute , @entity189 has grounds to get the citation dismissed			1
" first and foremost typically a client will tell me , ' i did n't see the plane in the air ' , " @entity189 said			0
" but i want to know the locations of where the lines are , if the ticket is written in the appropriate venue [ or county ] if the troopers come from different stations , if the ticket is valid on its face			0
" " every inconsistency goes in the benefit of the driver			0
the time on the citation is usually the most critical			0
if the pilot says 3.59 , but the ticket 's at 3.58 , or 4.01 , sometimes i do n't even take these to trial			1
" tread warily the next time you 're tempted to put your foot down in @entity21			0
you never know who might be watching			0

a few states in the @entity27 use aircraft to monitor speeders , reckless drivers
aviation enforcement does n't use radar ; it 's a stopwatch time over distance equation
pilots radio the speeding car 's information to a waiting state trooper on the ground
