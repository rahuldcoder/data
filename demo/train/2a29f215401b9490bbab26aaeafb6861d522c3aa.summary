@entity0 -- the former head of @entity4 counterterror operations said tuesday the " imminent threat " posed by an @entity9 offshoot in @entity10 has n't lessened after a @entity4 air campaign there			2
speaking to @entity1 's @entity12 , @entity11 said by his analysis the threat from the @entity20 " is still in the same place as it was before " president @entity16 ordered airstrikes against the terror operation last month			1
" this group was in a position to train without any sort of interference , they were able to recruit operatives , " said @entity21 , who stepped down as director of the @entity23 in september			1
" we saw that they were looking to test explosives			0
so they were in the advanced stages of plotting			0
they had both intent and that capability that put them nearing an execution phase of an attack			0
" president @entity16 announced strikes against @entity44 in september at the same time he began the mission to " degrade and destroy " the islamic state terror group in @entity10 and @entity47			1
at the time , senior officials described the threat posed by @entity44 as " imminent			1
" in the days after the strikes , the @entity50 said they believed the mission had " degraded , damaged , destroyed some of their capabilities , " but did n't specify whether the threat was taken out altogether			2
no subsequent strikes against @entity44 have been announced by the @entity4 military			1
@entity21 said on tuesday the types of individual who have joined @entity44 -- " hardened , seasoned veterans " -- made it unlikely the threat had diminished			1
" i think it 's unlikely that threat 's altogether been eliminated , " @entity21 said , adding that some senior leaders with the group had been killed			1
what 's the difference between @entity71 , @entity72 and the @entity73 ? before the strikes began in @entity10 , @entity4 government officials had barely acknowledged the presence of @entity44 , which formed from former @entity9 members			1
sources have said the group has the same aim as @entity71 : recruiting and training foreign fighters who could return home to stage attacks			2
while @entity21 said foreign fighters present a broad risk to @entity4 ' security , the potential for so - called " lone wolf " attacks by unaffiliated terrorists also worries officials			0
the propaganda circulated by @entity71 online could allow @entity4 to be motivated by the group without ever leaving the country , he said			2
" the other issue is somebody in the @entity4 , who never leaves the @entity4 , simply sits in their basement reading some of this hateful propaganda that @entity71 puts out , " he said			0
" the concern is that somebody just reads that and they have something in their own mind that makes them think that 's what they want to do			0
they would seek to carry out what we would think would be a relatively small scale attack , but a lethal attack nonetheless			0
" @entity21 : @entity4 lost track of terrorists after @entity120			0

@entity11 is the former director of the @entity23 .
his analysis finds the threat from the @entity44 group *remains* even after airstrikes .
