-- the throaty , thumping churn of the military helicopter convoy is a sound like no other			0
it 's a common sound in @entity7 , but less so in the skies over @entity9			2
@entity10 does n't get back to his old town much these days			1
he did last week ; he returned to @entity12 for slightly more than 24 hours to celebrate his 49th birthday with some friends , to make a public appearance at an auto plant , to raise some money for upcoming campaigns			1
and as he arrived late on a wet and cloud - darkened afternoon , there was that baritone rumble of the line of helicopters , there were the @entity25 looking up toward the president in @entity27 , there were the streets closed to traffic in anticipation of his motorcade			0
@entity10 arouses in people such political passions , both positive and negative , that sometime it feels futile to discuss him without knowing that the conversation will veer inevitably into heated partisan territory			1
yet there may be some usefulness -- especially for those of us not consumed by politics -- in stepping back , on an occasion like one of his rare returns to @entity12 , to consider a lesson inherent in his rise : aim high			1
it seems pretty simple , after the fact			0
@entity10 is president of the @entity52			1
of course he was ambitious ; of course he set his sights high , in his successful 2004 campaign for the @entity56 and then in the 2008 campaign that took him to the @entity58			2
today those decisions of his are , literally , history			0
but it is instructive to think of him not as the man in @entity27 , but as the frustrated 41 - year - old state legislator in @entity64 , @entity12 , in january of 2003			1
he had tried once for an office that would move him onto the national stage ; in 2000 he had attempted a run for the @entity68			1
he was crushed by a margin of 2 - to - 1 in the @entity71 primary			0
by 2003 he was back in @entity64 , a face in the crowd			0
he was known to those who follow state politics closely , and to statehouse reporters , but @entity10 at the beginning of 2003 could have walked into most restaurants and stores in @entity9 and not have turned a single head			1
there were two marquee political stars in the state : the glamorous new governor , @entity85 , who had just been sworn in for his first term , and the mayor of @entity9 , @entity88 , bearer of the most famous name in local government			2
what was @entity10 to do ? bide his time in @entity64 , hoping to achieve increasingly more influential committee assignments ? eventually try once more for the @entity52 @entity68 , after the humiliating rejection in 2000 ? put his ambitions for elective office away , and take up the private practice of law ? we know what he did instead			1
it does n't always work ; a person can aim high , and fall flat on his face			1
he can be mocked for even trying , especially when he comes up short			0
but as @entity27 and its convoy thundered over the edge of where @entity111 touches the shore in @entity9 last week , as the people on the streets looked skyward , a jury at the @entity106 a few blocks to the west had just completed another day of deliberations that will determine if @entity85 will remain a free citizen or will be sent to prison			2
when @entity10 , before climbing into the helicopter , had landed at @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity122 was waiting patiently in the rain to stand in a receiving line and shake the president 's hand			1
things have n't been going particularly smoothly for @entity10 in recent months ; his poll numbers are down , he seems under constant criticism from every direction , his missteps often appear on newspaper front pages and at the top of television newscasts			2
why anyone wants the job that a president has is a question that rational people tend to ask themselves from time to time			0
yet when we do take that step back from the frenzy of a given day , and consider the choices a person makes during the course of a lifetime -- the choices about whether to be satisfied with what you have , or to take that leap of faith and try for something beyond what the rest of the world thinks you can do			0
. i have a copy of a letter , a public document , that i have held onto since november 13 , 2008 , when it was written			0
it was addressed to @entity85 , who on that day was still the governor of @entity12			2
" dear mr. governor : " i hereby resign effective november 16 , 2008 from the @entity56 in order to prepare for my duties as @entity165			0
" sincerely , " @entity10 " you ask yourself what must go through his mind , in his seat aboard @entity27 , as he looks down at the city where he once lived , at the people who live there now , the people peering up toward the chopper convoy 's roar			1
impossible things can happen to a person			0
but first , a person has to try			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			2

@entity10 was a state legislator whose *advancement* was blocked in @entity12
@entity181 recalls @entity10 rejected idea of staying in place , sought national office
even @entity10 's critics must be impressed by how he chose to aim high , @entity181 says
@entity181 : people can accomplish the " impossible , " but only if they try
