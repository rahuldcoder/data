-- if the 21st century belongs to @entity3 , as some have argued , then it is worth asking what the defining @entity3 idea will be			1
it is unsurprising that this very issue has ginned up ferocious debate within @entity3 , as the country 's might grows but its voice remains meek on the global stage			1
economic success alone has yet to evince a self - assured @entity3 that it can offer a set of compelling values and ideas to the world			1
as a country that prides itself on the continuity of its great civilization and cultural force , @entity3 seems to grow increasingly dissatisfied with punching below its weight in the world of ideas			1
indeed , much of the 20th century was defined by the rise of the @entity28 and the dominance of the @entity28 idea : it was essentially an articulation of what modernity means			1
to be modern meant widespread economic prosperity , a healthy middle class , and technological superiority , combined with values that emphasized individual rights and freedoms to pursue whatever lives , liberties , and happiness that one sought			2
it was a manifestation of the ideals that were enshrined in the @entity46 , a document that , at the young nation 's inception , defined what kind of country the @entity28 ought to strive for			0
in many ways , the country was born out of a few central ideas because its existence could not be predicated on strong ethnic kinships , bloodlines , or the old monarchical order			0
it was not the " @entity59 " but a new nation that was moving toward collective ideals			0
the belief in the very idea of @entity28 was the strongest glue that could bind together a diverse , continental nation			2
that cohesive idea has anchored the " @entity72 " and provided ballast for themes that are readily found in @entity69 and other popular culture products that pervade the global market			2
whether by design or accidental , the genius of the @entity28 idea is that it is simply an open source template , or a " default setting , " that can be easily replicated and customized in different cultural and institutional environments			0
its power and universalizing appeal is apparent			0
little wonder that the @entity28 idea gained immense market share and is still widely equated with the general aspiration of obtaining a high living standard and human dignity			0
@entity3 , in contrast , is both of the old world and a young republic -- or as scholar @entity91 once rendered it , " a civilization pretending to be a nation - state			1
" and its transition into a modern state has been anything but smooth			1
the modern @entity3 state was forged from a nasty civil war , and its recent history since 1949 has been plagued by a series of highly disruptive discontinuities			1
it has had no continuous narrative from which to draw inspiration and to define the soul of a nation			0
in fact , the @entity105 under @entity106 primarily defined itself as what it is not -- that is , it was n't feudal or traditional			0
for the next six decades , the country lurched from devastating revolution to hyper materialism , breaking with whatever ideological milieu that had existed at the time			0
when @entity114 took power in 1978 , the only " ism " that mattered was pragmatism , as the country went to work on nation building and zeroed in on material prosperity			0
thirty - five years and several trillions worth of gdp later , an entire generation of @entity3 is waking up to the fact that it still has little idea of what kind of nation to strive for			1
all this relentless work has built a dynamic middle - income economy , yet cumulative wealth is no substitute for the richness of a nation , especially for a @entity3 that believes it has much to offer the world			1
after all , this is a country that once brought the world paper , gunpowder , and the compass			0
virtually every @entity3 school child knows that			1
but few @entity3 know or agree on what @entity3 should stand for in the 21st century			1
it is clearly a global economic power , but unlike the @entity28 , @entity3 seems to have little desire to stake out social and political values that others might adopt. the @entity3 government , which tightly controls historical narratives , simply can not look into its recent past to seek out those values because even communism is derived from a @entity154 political philosophy appropriated for @entity3 conditions			2
and politically , it could be potentially disastrous if the government owned up to all the dark chapters in its recent past			0
it seems that @entity3 has little choice but to look to its distant past in search of a continuous narrative and an indigenous idea that can carry the nation forward in the @entity164			1
the new leadership of the @entity166 , particularly president @entity167 , has prioritized this effort because it understands that a major source of its political power is derived from ideological legitimacy			0
to keep a continental nation together , @entity3 , too , needs a ruling party to govern around a set of ideas so that its people can imagine what the country can and should become			2
and so the " great rejuvenation " of the @entity3 nation has become the new ideological offering -- an explicit effort to connect today 's @entity3 to the glories of a former empire that sat at the center of the world			2
it revives the traditional ideas of wealth and power that have defined the country through much of its history			0
the @entity3 leadership is leaving little doubt that @entity3 will once again be a global force that garners respect			2
yet it is far from clear what a rejuvenated @entity3 means or how that force might be employed			2
reestablishing " national greatness " may win over some of the @entity3 public , but it hardly serves as an idea or value proposition that can extend beyond @entity3 borders			1
each nation is entitled to deem itself unique , exceptional , and " great " -- the @entity28 certainly does			0
but some nations also use their wealth and power to articulate a vision of how to shape the world and aspire to address common challenges			0
the tagline for a @entity216 advertisement , for example , is " a global force for good			0
" @entity3 , at least so far , has exhibited little interest in becoming a charge d'affaires with world - shaping responsibilities , even as outside pressures mount for it to assume them			2
indeed , it may simply be comfortable with being just @entity3 -- an idea that the rest of the world may have to get used to			1
