@entity0 -- president @entity2 announced thursday he is sending up to 300 military advisers to @entity4 , and could down the road authorize targeted military action , if necessary			0
advisers will help train and support @entity4 forces , while gathering intelligence on the militant group , the @entity7 , which has taken several cities in the north and west of @entity4			2
@entity2 said such action was necessary to help prevent a civil war in @entity4 that could destabilize the region , and also prevent creation of a terrorist safe haven			0
one aircraft carrier and five warships are already positioned in the @entity25 , @entity22 drones are flying intelligence missions over @entity4 and military sources tell @entity1 a list of @entity7 targets has been compiled			1
special forces teams will arrive in @entity4 soon			0
they could ultimately assist in calling in airstrikes , if they are authorized			2
" going forward , we will be prepared to take targeted and precise military action if and when we determine that the situation on the ground requires it , " @entity2 said on thursday			0
without deploying combat troops -- which @entity2 has ruled out -- how could the @entity22 take further military action ? airstrikes : air power is the most talked about option to target @entity7 fighters who have seized cities in northwestern @entity4 and could advance into @entity47			1
navy ships in the @entity25 , which could facilitate an emergency evacuation of @entity22 personnel in @entity4 , would also enable missile strikes or bombing			1
striking from the air could hamper the movement of @entity7 fighters , said @entity55 , associate director of the @entity56 at @entity57			0
airstrikes would " help stem the advancing tide of @entity7 , mainly by striking their forces advancing toward @entity47 or other cities not already under their control , " he said			2
targeted strikes could help shift the momentum from @entity7 fighters to @entity4 soldiers and could be highly effective and low risk , @entity55 said			1
as during the 2011 intervention in @entity70 , ground forces are unlikely to pose a significant threat to @entity22 air power and @entity7 's air defenses " would likely be even weaker , " @entity55 said			1
@entity22 bombing would not only give @entity4 forces the upper hand against @entity7 , but could provide a much - needed " psychological boost " to @entity4 forces after soldiers abandoned their posts in @entity78 , which was quickly captured by @entity7			1
another benefit ? @entity22 airstrikes would be achievable without deploying @entity22 military personnel near the ground targets , @entity1 military analyst retired gen. @entity82 said			1
while some have raised concerns that an air campaign could result in a high number of civilian casualties , @entity82 called @entity7 a " very conventional force , " boasting armored vehicles , artillery and ammo stockpiles			0
precision strikes would be difficult to call in without forces on the ground , but the advisers @entity2 is now deploying could fulfill that task , @entity1 military analyst @entity96 said			1
@entity22 special forces would be " in a great position to call in any air strikes , " @entity96 said			1
retired army gen. @entity105 called airstrikes " one of the best guarantees " to keep @entity4 in one piece , but argued that @entity7 is more focused on consolidating their gains and may not be interested in pushing into @entity47			0
" it 's highly unlikely that they have either the manpower or the capability -- or quite frankly the desire -- to go well south into the southern , predominantly almost exclusively @entity116 areas , " @entity105 said			0
drones : what if @entity2 decides he does n't want @entity22 pilots flying over @entity4 at all ? drones have already been at the forefront of the @entity22 's fight against terrorism in the @entity123 and perhaps the most recognizable weapon of the @entity2 administration 's policy in countries like @entity128 and @entity129			1
but drones are best used to strike small , specific targets like vehicles and individual suspected terrorists and several military officials have told @entity1 that drone strikes would have a limited impact on a force like @entity7			1
drones would help @entity22 military officials fill the intelligence gap they need to seal in order to strike @entity7 precisely , effectively and with limited civilian casualties			1
experts and critics have cited the lack of updated military intelligence in @entity7 - controlled areas as a hindrance to identifying specific targets			1
and the @entity148 has ramped up drone surveillance over northern and western @entity4 since @entity7 took several cities			0
but some say that is not enough			0
on the ground , intelligence - gathering : @entity2 has ruled out sending troops " back into combat			2
" plans for advisers are similar to those that retired @entity161 gen. @entity160 , the former head of @entity162 , called for monday on @entity1			0
" they can provide some of that ground intelligence ... that we 're lacking , " he said			0
" they also can control airstrikes if necessary			0
they can function as advisers			0
" @entity160 suggested the elite forces could work with @entity4 forces as well as with @entity173 fighters who recently seized control of the northern , oil - rich city of @entity176 and are also battling the @entity178 militants			0
gen. @entity179 also called intelligence - gathering essential to distinguish between @entity7 fighters and civilians			2
" @entity183 is the driver			0
you ca n't drop bombs or hit targets without intelligence , " @entity179 said			0
" in order to get intel , especially in a nation that 's like @entity4 , you have to have people seeking that intel on the ground			0
it just ca n't come from satellite photos , or an airplane moving at 200 knots above a target and say : ' hey , that 's good enough , let 's drop a bomb			0
' " to those urging @entity2 to take swift military action to strike @entity7 , @entity179 has a message : easier said than done			0
he urged caution , warning that without more intelligence , @entity22 strikes could hit civilians			1
" and as soon as the first bomb or the first strafing run hits a school bus or a car full of civilians , then the @entity22 are to blame for that , " he said			1
but sending advisers could just be a first step to a larger @entity22 mission in @entity4 , experts warned			1
" this is the first step			0
this is how you get drawn into these situations , " @entity96 , a @entity1 military analyst , said			0
cooperating with @entity225 : @entity2 also said that @entity225 can play a constructive role in @entity4 if it is not " coming in solely as an armed force on behalf of the @entity116			2
" @entity225 deployed about 500 @entity229 troops to help the @entity4 government			1
but @entity225 's growing influence in @entity4 continues to worry experts and @entity22 officials as @entity225 's involvement risks further inflaming sectarian tensions already at a boiling point in the region			1
as @entity225 planes fly through @entity4 to arm the @entity240 regime and as the war in @entity240 swells into neighboring countries , experts are warning of a possible regional war between @entity245 and @entity116			1
to keep @entity4 from breaking into pieces , secretary of state @entity246 said the @entity22 would consider communicating with @entity225 to kill the advance of @entity7 militants			1
@entity246 is heading to @entity4 for consultations on the situation there			0
" we 're open to discussions if there 's something constructive that can be contributed by @entity225 , " he said in an interview with @entity253 , responding to a question about cooperating with the @entity225 military			2
" i think we need to go step by step and see what , in fact , might be a reality			0
" @entity246 clarified thursday that the @entity22 is only " interested in communicating with @entity225 " and sharing information to prevent mistakes			1
but the powder - keg situation in @entity4 has convinced even one of the most conservative members of the @entity270 to consider working with @entity225			2
" the @entity225 can provide some assets to make sure @entity47 does n't fall , " sen. @entity271 of @entity272 said			2
@entity274 , a former deputy national security adviser , agreed that a coordinated effort in @entity4 between the @entity22 and @entity225 might benefit both sides			1
defense secretary @entity277 told @entity279 coordination with @entity225 would not be a first as the @entity22 had previously " worked with the @entity225 on that western border in @entity282			1
" others worried that a collaboration with @entity225 could further alienate @entity285 who are already weary of the @entity4 government or @entity225 's regional rivals			2
house speaker @entity289 said the @entity22 should rule out any partnership with @entity225			1
" i can just imagine what our friends in the region , our allies will be thinking by reaching out to @entity225 at a time when they continue to pay for terrorists and foster terrorism not only in @entity240 , in @entity299 but in @entity300 as well , " @entity289 said			2
@entity2 announces military advisers going to @entity4 transcript : @entity2 's remarks on @entity22 response to @entity4 crisis @entity2 : military advisers will go to @entity4 , but @entity22 not returning to combat @entity1 's @entity308 , @entity309 and @entity310 contributed to this report .			2

on airstrikes : the @entity22 may have trouble recognizing militants from civilians .
drones are effective for precision strikes , but may be most helpful with other missions
experts say filling the intelligence gap is the *no.* 1 *priority*
the @entity22 could also collaborate with @entity225 , which has already sent 500 troops to help
