he is the face of terror			2
a ruthless leader with a twisted ideology			2
and the sadistic architect of a campaign of mayhem and misery			2
and yet , very little is known about @entity8 , the leader of @entity9			1
he operates in the shadows , leaving his underlings to orchestrate his repulsive mandates			2
he resurfaces every once in a while in videotaped messages to mock the impotence of the @entity17 military			1
and he uses his faith to recruit the impressionable and the disenfranchised to his cause			1
he 's a religious scholar @entity8 was born in @entity20 that borders @entity21			1
he studied under a cleric and then attended @entity23 for higher studies on @entity25			1
that 's why he 's also known as ' @entity27 , ' which translates to an expert in monotheism , or the oneness of @entity31			2
he 's a polyglot he speaks several languages fluently : @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37			2

he was n't too effective as a leader and had a hard time keeping his second - in - command in check			0
@entity8 was more radical and had grander designs			1
... and merciless as no. 1 @entity61 was killed in a security crackdown in 2009 , along with about 700 of his followers			0
that left @entity8 in charge			1
he vowed to strike back , and his group has spared no one : government workers , police officers , journalists , villagers , students and churchgoers			1
@entity83 estimates that in the past five years , more than 3,000 people have been killed			0
he 's come back from the dead the @entity17 military has touted @entity8 's death several times , only to retract its claim after he appeared alive and vibrant in propaganda videos			1

he uses @entity25 to recruit and radicalize the northeast , where @entity9 has been most active , is economically depressed and among the least educated regions in @entity17			1
@entity8 has done a good job of convincing residents that the powers in @entity106 are corrupt and a better system of government would be a strict enforcement of @entity25 @entity111 law across @entity17			1
and his promise , coupled with a weapon and a license to plunder , has been enticing to hundreds of young men			0
... and the government 's response is n't helping the central government 's heavy - handed and frequently untargeted anti-terrorism campaign has just helped create more members to sustain @entity9			0
the country 's own @entity122 last year accused the military of arbitrary killings , torture and rape in its campaign against the group			1
this makes for fertile territory for @entity9			0
he 's exporting his brand of terror there 's no firm evidence as yet that @entity9 has ambitions beyond @entity17			0
but its campaign of terror has spilled into remote parts of @entity142 and it appears to have informal links with militant @entity145 groups in @entity146 and @entity21			0
he 's made good on his brutal threat it was in may 2013 that @entity150 first announced in a video that @entity9 would start kidnapping girls			0

last june , the @entity178 put a bounty on him , offering a reward of up to $ 7 million for information leading to his location			1
... but that 's yet to yield results here 's why , says @entity188 's chief international correspondent @entity187 : " ( @entity190 warlord ) @entity191 's had a bounty for years and years			1
even with the ' @entity195 ' video that went viral , nothing has happened to get @entity191 -- even though it 's about the only thing in @entity190 that the @entity178 has committed some forces and some intelligence to			1
" @entity199 was not given up because of the $ 25 million bounty			2
