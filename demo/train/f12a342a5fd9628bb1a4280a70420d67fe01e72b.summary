acknowledges that " @entity9 " under @entity1 's reign continues to rank no. 1 in both total viewers and advertiser - prized 18 - to - 49 - year - olds			1
that 's against @entity12 's recently relocated " @entity14 " as well as @entity17 ' longstanding " @entity15 with @entity16 , " according to @entity13			2
nonetheless , @entity3 will be pushing him out for a second time , with " @entity27 " host @entity20 taking over " in conjunction " with the network 's coverage of next year 's @entity23 from @entity24 , @entity25 ( scheduled to run from february 7 - 23 )			1
@entity29 ceo @entity28 says in a statement that " we are purposefully making this change when @entity1 is no. 1 , just as @entity1 replaced @entity33 ( in 1992 ) when he was no. 1			1
@entity20 is a unique talent and this is his time			2
" @entity33 retired under his own power , though , surprising @entity3 in the process			0
@entity1 is unwillingly walking the plank , as he 's made clear in recent monologues with barbed jokes at @entity3 's expense			1
but if this indeed is @entity44 's time , it may be in large part because we live in very different times			1
the @entity50 - driven " social media " did n't exist during @entity33 's storied 30 - year reign			1
he simply had to deliver a conventional tv audience			0
he did so year after year against a variety of competitors in a much less crowded late - night field			0
@entity44 averages 1.7 million viewers compared to 3.5 million viewers for @entity1 , according to the @entity3 release			1
he also draws fewer 18 - to - 49 - year - olds , although a later time slot certainly is a factor in both cases			0
but @entity44 , as well as @entity63 and @entity64 ' late night standard - bearer , @entity62 , all excel in a social media arena that remains of little if any interest to either @entity1 or @entity16			1
networks increasingly see this as a key ingredient in times when conventional tv ratings continue to sag amid myriad channel choices			0
let 's look at their respective number of @entity77 followers			1
as of this writing , @entity44 's personal page has 8.33 million and @entity62 is right behind with 8.09 million			1
@entity80 weighs in with 2.42 million followers , meaning he still has some work to do on this front			0
but @entity1 , via the official @entity9 site , has just 525,000 followers			2
and @entity16 's @entity15 page has 234,000 followers			2
the host does n't have a personal @entity77 page , although some are tweeting in his name and using his picture , according to a @entity15 representative			2
@entity44 and @entity80 also boast a number of " viral videos " with star supporting players ranging from first lady @entity98 to actor @entity99			0
@entity44 's recent " @entity101 " performance with @entity98 became an immediate @entity103 sensation that to date has more than 15 million views			1
in announcing @entity44 's promotion , @entity3 noted that his show " has continued to garner attention for its viral videos , " with the host also winning an @entity111 in the " @entity112 " after being named 2009 's " @entity113			1
" this week 's @entity64 press release on extending " @entity115 " through november 2015 touches only briefly on @entity62 's conventional nielsen ratings performance among young adults			0
but the network says a mouthful about his social media prowess			1
it bears repeating because it 's so illustrative of the value networks place on out - of - the - box moxie			0
@entity62 's show " leads the late - night crowd when it comes to online activity and engagement , " says @entity64 , " with the show and its host drawing more than 8.3 million followers on @entity77 , 2 million fans on @entity134 , 2 million unique users each month on @entity136 and 15 million video views each month on @entity136 and @entity103			1
" not only that , but the @entity139 app won the 2012 @entity111 for " @entity140 in @entity141			0
" the great unknown , at least from a financial standpoint , is whether all these accolades and millions of off - network fans will lead to appreciable sums of money in the bank			0
we 'll likely never know with @entity1 and @entity16 , though			2
their skill sets basically begin and end with putting on a show each night			0
in the now vast multimedia universe , that may be akin to sending a message via telegraph instead of e-mail			0
after all , these really are n't just the late - night wars anymore			0
they 're the anytime , anywhere wars , with @entity44 , @entity63 and @entity62 arming themselves to the hilt			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			0

@entity166 : @entity1 still no. 1 in late night for @entity3 , but network replacing him with @entity20
he says @entity3 says it 's @entity44 's time , and that may have much to do with social media
he says @entity44 , @entity62 can deliver @entity77 , other followers that @entity1 , @entity16 ca n't
bark : network making it clear that 's *important* . but can it turn social media sway into money ?
