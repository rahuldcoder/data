-- it could have been a scene lifted straight from the classic @entity3 film " @entity2 " -- a drama in which a military prison erupts into riot after an inmate dies following a repetitive drill on an artificial hill in the blazing desert sun. but in @entity14 's real life version of the film , 18 army officers have been charged , a defense minister has resigned and the parents of 24 - year - old @entity18 are still demanding justice after their son died following an arduous punishment drill in @entity14 's searing summer heat			1
corporal @entity23 was just three days short of completing his military service last month when he was reportedly put in solitary confinement for bringing a mobile phone with a camera onto his military base , normally a minor military transgression			2
later subjected to a series of tough punishment exercises , doctors say he died of organ failure brought on by severe heatstroke			0
since then , @entity35 has erupted in protest			2
more than 100,000 placard - waving people protested outside the @entity38 on the weekend , according to organizers citizen 1985 , and another large protest is scheduled for this weekend			2
the protest underscores the increasing unpopularity of military service , not just in @entity14 , but in @entity45 's other developed economies such as @entity46 and @entity47 where young people see compulsory military service as an unwelcome interruption to university and a career			1
@entity47 , with a conscription period of 24 months and further 10 years of reservist obligations , has one of the longest periods of national service behind @entity46 and @entity58			1
" conscription takes away two years of a citizen 's freedom in the name of ' national interests ' , " said former conscript @entity59 in a @entity47 political blog			2
" unfortunately , in the case of @entity47 , where tensions are cool , these ' national ' or ' security ' interests do not outweigh two years of the lives of every male citizen			0
" " even though the government often compares @entity47 to @entity58 , @entity46 and @entity14 as being a small and vulnerable state , the fact is , they live in situations of greater tension ( than we do in @entity47 )			1
" the @entity47 government promotes military service as a cheaper way of building a standing army and as a means of bonding recruits regardless of their backgrounds			1
" if anything , @entity47 are just further trained to blindly obey instructions from their superiors , " @entity59 said in the post			0
" this culture is detrimental to society as a whole , and seems to affect creativity in the society , which is important for the spirit of free enterprise			0
surely two years of a person 's life is more important than this ' bonding ' that presumably takes place ? " the @entity47 government has been criticized for responding to worried parents by making military service safer and softer for recruits -- in one case a conscript was famously snapped making his maid carry his military pack			1
for many , these responses are part of the civilianization of military life , throwing a question mark over the effectiveness of a popular -- rather than a professional -- army			0
" i would say ( these developments ) are partly in response to worried parents , but they are probably due in large to a natural evolution of the society in which these institutions are found , " @entity59 told @entity0			0
" for example , there has also been a larger appetite for health and safety measures in , say , the construction sector as well			0
" efforts in @entity46 to make military service more palatable and popular by making a special unit of celebrity k - pop recruits was scrapped last month after it was found that too often celebrity lifestyles were inimical to the harsh realities of military life			1
top brass and regular recruits took a dim view of unauthorized dates , drunken trips to massage parlors and other preferential treatment for the celebrity grunts in a country where military service is regarded as a solemn national duty			2
" although we initially formed the unit to promote the military , a number of unfortunate incidents damaged the public image of the military and lowered the morale of all the regular soldiers who are in the service , " the ministry 's vice spokesperson @entity146 said at a press conference			2
first formed 16 years ago , the celebrity unit acted as the military 's public relations office by holding concerts for soldiers or performing at important anniversaries			1
the issue of celebrities enlisting in the military has long been controversial in @entity46 where some argue that k - pop stars should be exempt from military service because of the substantial foreign revenue they bring to the country			1
@entity173 -- the " @entity174 " star -- is perhaps one of the most high - profile military discipline cases , famously repeating his two - year service in 2007 after neglecting his duties by giving private concerts and tv show appearances			2
in @entity14 , meanwhile , @entity23 's death has dealt a severe blow to the public profile of the country 's military			1
already , the @entity185 is falling drastically short in its bid to attract volunteers : its target for 2013 is 17,447 people , but as of july 3 only 1,847 had signed up			0
@entity190 still claims @entity14 -- which split with @entity191 in 1949 following the civil war -- as part of its sovereign territory and says it will take the island by force if necessary			0
a 2011 report by @entity14 's @entity185 states the @entity198 has 10 times as many troops as @entity14 and a military spend of roughly us $ 78 billion , compared with @entity14 's us $ 9 billion			1
" yet , the @entity191 's actual military funding is somewhere between two to three times the figure it has disclosed			0
therefore , the actual difference in defense budget on the both sides may reach up to 21-fold , " the report stated			0
the @entity209 incident is being taken seriously by @entity14 's military whose plans to raise an all - volunteer force by the end of 2014 may be receding in the current hostile climate			1
" there will certainly be an impact , " col. @entity216 , director of the ministry 's @entity217 , told a news conference			0
" we are continuing to observe the extent of what that impact might be			0

more than 100,000 protest in @entity35 after military punishment leads to conscript 's death
protests may deal a blow to @entity14 's plans to scrap military service by 2015
@entity47 's military service , at 24 months , is one of the longest after @entity46 and @entity58
@entity46 's military scraps its " celebrity " unit after discipline *problems*
