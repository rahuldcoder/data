@entity0 -- a northwest @entity4 town where asbestos contamination has killed more than 200 people will get more than $ 130 million in cleanup and medical assistance from the @entity10 administration , the @entity2 announced wednesday			1
@entity11 , @entity4 , will get new help dealing with asbestos contamination			1
the declaration is the first issued by the agency , which has grappled with the " toxic legacy " of a mine outside @entity11 , @entity4 , since 1999 , administrator @entity14 said			1
the town was heavily contaminated with asbestos - laced dust that federal prosecutors said resulted in more than 200 deaths and 1,000 illnesses			1
" for decades , the disease and death rate from asbestosis in the @entity11 area was staggeringly high -- much higher than the national average , " @entity24 told reporters			1
not only did dust from the mine spread all over @entity11 and the neighboring town of @entity35 for decades , but tailings from the facility also were used as fill for driveways , gardens and playgrounds , she said			1
" literally no matter where these residents turned , they were being exposed yet again , " @entity24 said			0
she said the declaration " should be a reminder of the serious consequences of mismanaging hazardous material			0
" @entity2 spokeswoman @entity47 said $ 6 million from the @entity48 will go to local health care providers to screen , diagnose and treat asbestos - related illnesses , while $ 125 million will go toward cleaning up contaminated areas			1
the new commitment brings the total amount the @entity2 has designated for the @entity11 area to $ 333 million , she said			1
the agency still needs to conduct " significant research " into the health effects of the type of asbestos that has been spread around town since the 1920s , she said , and does not yet know how many properties will need to be cleaned up			2
during @entity24 's confirmation hearing in january , @entity4 sen. @entity63 said the valley 's 12,000 residents had been " hung out to dry " and pressed @entity24 to review the issue			2
wednesday , @entity63 presented @entity24 and @entity48 secretary @entity68 with a photo of one of his constituents , former miner @entity72			0
" he died , and others in @entity11 have died , " said @entity63 , a @entity73			2
" but the decision is the beginning of what needed to be done			0
it 's the first time in @entity80 history that we 've had this declaration , and i can not think of a more fitting time and place for it than @entity11 , @entity4			1
" @entity63 is the former chairman of the @entity86 and now leads the @entity87			0
he is a key architect of a still - being - drafted health care bill the @entity10 administration has said it wants to see pass this year			0
the @entity11 operation began producing vermiculite -- a mineral often used in insulation -- in 1919			2
dust from the plant covered patches of grass , dusted the tops of cars and drifted through the air in a hazy smoke that became a part of residents ' daily lives			0
but the product was contaminated with tremolite asbestos , a particularly toxic substance that has been linked to mesothelioma , a cancer that can attack the lining of the lungs , abdomen , or heart			0
in may , a federal jury acquitted mine operator @entity116 and three of its former executives of criminal charges related to the contamination			1
@entity116 operated the facility from 1963 until it closed in 1990 , and prosecutors argued that its executives knowingly released the substance and tried to hide the danger from the community			0
@entity63 said that despite the verdict , he still believes the company " knew it was contaminating the town			0
" " regrettably , the trial did not conclude the way i thought that it should , " he said			0
there was no immediate response from the company to the senator 's remarks			0
during the three - month trial , @entity116 did not deny that the asbestos came from its mine , but it said it acted responsibly to clean up the contamination			2
it also paid millions in medical bills for area residents , and agreed in 2008 to pay $ 250 million to reimburse the @entity2 for its cleanup efforts .			1
