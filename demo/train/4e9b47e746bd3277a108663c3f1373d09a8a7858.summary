the modest clinic on @entity1 in laid - back @entity2 , @entity4 , was well known to patients seeking powerful pain medication			0
they went there to find the " @entity9			0
" dr. @entity10 earned that nickname because , according to court records , he was writing prescriptions for massive numbers of pills -- hundreds , even thousands , at a time			1
he prescribed medications like oxycodone , a powerful opioid pain killer that is highly addictive			2
at the nearby @entity21 , emergency room doctors noticed a pattern and sensed a problem			0
" we communicate first with our patients and then with the primary care providers			0
we then began to see that there was a pattern and that clearly by far dr. @entity10 's prescribing stood out above any of the other physicians in the computer , " dr. @entity26 said			1
@entity26 found that @entity33 documented more than 400 emergency room visits from @entity10 's patients , according to court documents			1
some were clearly dependent on opiates , he said , and others were seeking more pain medication			0
" and of course we saw the complications , too , " @entity26 noted			0
those complications included symptoms of severe drug withdrawal and overdoses			2
the @entity46 , and eventually the @entity47 , were called to investigate			2
that investigation resulted in a laundry list of charges against @entity10 including the over-prescription of narcotics , prescribing narcotics when there was no medical need , and illegal distribution of a narcotic to a person under the age of 21			1
according to the @entity47 , there were a dozen overdose deaths associated with @entity10			1
twenty - seven - year - old @entity62 was one of them			2
@entity62 started seeing @entity10 after he injured his back on a construction job			1
he was seeking pain medication			0
he got it , and soon he was hooked			0
as the months went by , @entity62 's parents noticed a change			2
" well , at some point , he started spending a lot of time in bed			0
and just watching tv , never doing anything , " @entity62 's father , @entity73 said			2
" and that seemed to get worse and worse			0
and then i noticed the color change in his face , his attitude , his love toward his family ... that all went away			0
" @entity62 slowly became aware that his son was addicted to oxycodone , and he called @entity10			1
" i was seeing paperwork with hundreds of oxycodone pills , " @entity62 told @entity86			1
" i wanted to know why he was giving him so many			0
" he says he never got an answer			0
in an affidavit , the @entity47 alleges that in the six weeks before @entity62 's death , @entity10 prescribed him a total of 2,087 pills , an average of 63 pills a day			1
on the day after @entity98 in 2011 , @entity62 received the news that his son had died of a drug overdose			1
in @entity62 's bedroom and car , investigators found bottles of multiple drugs , and some were empty			1
all were prescribed by @entity10			1
the autopsy concluded that a cocktail of oxycodone , hydromorphone , alprazolam and methadone was the cause of death			0
" right now we have more people that are dying from prescription opioids than cocaine and heroin combined , " said @entity114 , a @entity47 special agent with years of experience on the front lines of the war on drugs			1
@entity114 says that in 2011 , the most recent year for which there are statistics , more than 22,000 people died from prescription drugs			1
late last year , @entity10 signed a plea agreement , admitting to a reduced number of charges			1
those charges include the illegal distribution of oxycodone , hydromorphone , alprazolam and fentanyl			1
the original charges against him carried a maximum sentence of 200 years in prison and up to $ 10 million in fines , but the plea bargain will likely reduce that sentence			0
@entity86 contacted @entity10 's attorney , but received no comment			2
to this day , @entity62 's parents struggle with the what - ifs			2
had he known then what he knows now , " i might have been able to save him , but i was more disappointed in him -- in making these bad decisions , " @entity73 said			0
" but it was n't him , it was the drugs that changed him			0
so i just turned my back on him , and i would n't do that today			0
