@entity0 -- @entity3 state media frequently treats @entity5 's atrocities of the past like breaking news of today			1
but lately , the steady flow of war history - related news has become a flood			2
amid fast - deteriorating @entity14 relations , @entity3 's @entity12 recently re-opened case files from a @entity3 military tribunal in 1956 and launched a dedicated website to publish summaries of confessions by 45 convicted @entity14 war criminals			1
among the horrifying accounts posted online by @entity3 authorities are confessions of raping countless women , burying people alive and performing human vivisections in @entity3 -- all handwritten by captured @entity14 army officers after @entity28 and long sealed in the state archives in @entity0			1
the @entity3 government 's target is clear			2
" since the @entity34 cabinet came into power in @entity5 , " begins the online introduction to the confessions , referring to @entity14 prime minister @entity34			1
" it has openly confused right and wrong to mislead the public , in an attempt to whitewash the history of external aggression and colonialism			0
" tense seas @entity3 and @entity5 have a dark history of conflict , including the nine - year @entity46 during which the contentious @entity47 took place from december 13 , 1937 to march 1 , 1938			1
@entity14 soldiers committed mass murders and forced @entity3 and @entity52 women into sexual slavery during the occupation of @entity55			1
but it was a more recent flare - up , say analysts , which brought the historic grievances back out into the open			0
relations between @entity3 and @entity5 became strained in 2012 when @entity5 claimed islands in the @entity62			1
@entity3 then declared in november 2013 an @entity63 over the @entity62 , imposing air traffic restrictions over the disputed area			1
@entity3 's moves have made @entity5 and other nations in @entity68 nervous over it 's expanding military and more assertive foreign policy , accusing @entity3 of trying to change the status quo			1
a right turn in december , @entity34 further stoked tensions by visiting the @entity73 where @entity14 soldiers are honored -- including wartime leaders convicted as class - a war criminals			1
@entity34 became the first sitting prime minister to make the provocative visit since @entity78 went in 2006			0
six months later , @entity34 declared a more liberal interpretation of @entity5 's post-war pacifist constitution , essentially lifting a decades - long ban that prevented its military from fighting abroad			2
the following month , @entity3 released the @entity14 wartime confessions online			1
@entity0 also marked the anniversary of the @entity46 with an elaborate commemoration ceremony at @entity86 , the site of the first showdown			0
" @entity3 is responding to prime minister @entity34 's attempts to rehabilitate the discredited wartime past			2
it 's trying to underscore the fact that @entity5 suffers from selective amnesia , " says @entity91 , an expert in @entity93 regional tensions and a professor at @entity95 , @entity96			1
global strategy for long - time @entity3 watchers , this back - and - forth may be escalating at an alarming rate , but it is nothing new			0
" since the early 1990s , the communist party has been trying to stoke @entity108 patriotism among the @entity3 people mostly because they wanted to regain some of the legitimacy they lost in the @entity113 massacre , " says @entity91 , referring to the bloody military crackdown on @entity3 student demonstrators in 1989			1
for @entity3 's president , the nationalism stoked by anti-japanese sentiment , could become a powerful tool			0
" nationalism is a very potent force in @entity3 right now			0
@entity121 is strengthening nationalistic sentiment to unify the country behind him and reinforce his own position as leader , " says @entity120 , a political commentator			0
beyond fomenting patriotism at home , @entity3 is also reminding its international partners that @entity5 has n't come clean about its past			2
@entity91 explains that @entity5 's imperialist history " is @entity34 's @entity131			1
" by highlighting @entity34 's right - wing inclinations , @entity3 can drive a wedge between the @entity135 and @entity5 , while pulling @entity52 -- another nation that suffers wartime scars inflicted by @entity5 -- closer			2
@entity3 appears to be using it 's propaganda push to isolate @entity5 from its allies			1
resolution but @entity3 's heavy - handed propaganda may backfire in the end because foreign governments may see it in a more cynical light			2
" if they press their case more quietly , it would be more effective , " says @entity91			0
it may also lead the nations further away from resolution			0
" these battles over history undermine trust and limit the room for diplomacy			1
it 's very difficult for both sides to find a face - saving way to climb down , " says @entity91			0
@entity34 has repeatedly called for face - to - face talks with his @entity3 counterpart , president @entity121			0
" the door for dialogue is always open on my side , and i hope @entity3 has the same attitude , " the @entity14 leader said			2
but analysts are not hopeful for talks , as both nations wait for the other to make the first move			0
" the @entity3 side has made it clear that they will not talk to @entity34 unless he takes action to show that his attitude has changed , but i do n't see @entity34 doing that in the absence of any commitment from @entity3 for a meeting first , " says @entity120			0
all eyes are now on the @entity176 coming up in november during which @entity34 has invited @entity121 to a meeting on the sidelines			0
the two leaders have never met since both came to power in 2012 .			0

@entity14 relations fast deteriorating amid tensions over disputed islands in the @entity62
analysts say @entity3 and @entity5 are engaged in a war of propaganda and *rhetoric*
