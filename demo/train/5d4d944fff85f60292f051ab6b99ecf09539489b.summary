@entity0 -- the bar has never been lower for the nearly 100 freshmen of the 113th @entity4 who were sworn - in on thursday			1
after all , it wo n't take much to exceed the abysmal approval rating of the previous @entity4			2
despite the usual burst optimism of a freshman class on @entity10 and the sentiment to reach across the aisle and dissolve partisan gridlock , recent history shows those pledges are destined to falter like so many @entity16 's resolutions			0
" on the day people are sworn in they are entitled to dream , " said @entity17 , director of the @entity19 's @entity18			0
" the idea that they are going to bridge the unbridgeable gap between the two parties is indeed a dream			0
" @entity27 signs fiscal cliff bill into law the new @entity4 faces many of the same stubborn issues that make bipartisanship in a politically divided country difficult to achieve			1
although @entity0 averted the worst aspects of the fiscal cliff earlier this week , the automatic spending cuts , or sequester , that were a centerpiece of that debate for months but cut out of the final deal at the last minute are coming around again in february			1
at about the same time , lawmakers will have to consider raising the nation 's debt ceiling , or the ability of the @entity43 to borrow money to pay the nation 's bills			1
both sides are already digging in on spending and debt			0
are days of @entity4 ' going big ' over ? a fresh controversy involves assistance to victims of @entity53			1
an aid bill approved by the @entity55 was shelved on tuesday night by @entity57 speaker @entity56 over concerns that voting on a big spending package immediately after approving a fiscal cliff deal that excluded deficit reduction would send a bad political signal			1
@entity64 and @entity65 politicians were incensed at @entity56 's inaction , prompting @entity65 gov. @entity67 to growl : that this is " why the @entity70 people hate @entity4			1
" a scaled - back version of $ 9 billion for immediate aid for flood insurance will be considered by both houses on friday			1
lawmakers will weigh the balance of the $ 60 billion plan later this month			0
furor over dropped vote for @entity53 aid defused further out on the horizon is an expected fight over gun control , a high priority for the @entity57 in the aftermath of the @entity86 school massacre that will face push - back from congressional members with high ratings and big - dollar donations from gun rights advocates			1
immigration reform , another @entity57 priority , will also stoke ideological differences and test the demographic shifts in @entity4			1
all in all , the sharp divisions on @entity10 are still evident and expectations for meaningful progress on substantive issues are not high			0
" my sense is that things are not going to be that different because the fundamental divisions that existed in the previous @entity4 are still there , " said @entity100 , a political science professor at @entity101			2
@entity106 faces on @entity10 " we still have a @entity108 @entity55 and @entity109 @entity57			2
we still have a divided @entity4			2
the ideological divisions between the parties are as great as they were in the last @entity4 , " he said			2
the divide is widened by a continued attrition of moderates , who lost or retired from seats on both sides of the aisle in both chambers			2
but on the other side of the question there have been subtle shifts in numbers and other changes that could make a difference in how votes on some issues play out , political experts say			0
republicans retained control of the @entity57 in november but @entity132 gained seats there and expanded their control of the @entity55			1
republicans now fill 234 seats in the new @entity57 , down from 242			1
there are @entity132 , up from 193			2
in the @entity55 , voters handed two former @entity109 seats to @entity132 for a new balance of 55 - 45			1
the 55 @entity108 seats include two independents who caucus with the party			0
@entity145 makes emotional return after stroke for the first time , the @entity148 is dominated by women and racial minorities , while the @entity109 caucus in that chamber is largely composed of white men			0
over in the @entity55 , 20 women â € ” the largest number in history â € ” will be sworn in			0
the increased diversity " means that we reflect @entity70 more , " said newly elected @entity159 @entity158 rep. @entity158			2
" you know the district where i come from is a very diverse district , and it is good to see @entity4 starting to look more like the rest of @entity70			1
and you see the demographic shifts that are happening across the country			0
" @entity171 remains strong , however , political experts say			0
" those things are interesting and it 's a good thing to have that diversity ... but just that party attached to the person 's name explains the roll call			0
it does n't matter the race or the gender			0
it 's the party affiliation , " @entity17 said			0
@entity56 , whose relationship with president @entity27 frayed further during the fiscal cliff negotiations , received the gavel again on thursday when he was re-elected to lead the chamber			1
while 220 of the @entity187 voted for the @entity189 lawmaker , a few members did n't answer , simply voted " present , " or cast ballots for other candidates			0
following the fiscal cliff fight , @entity56 is telling colleagues no more negotiating deals and that " regular order works best " from now on			1
@entity56 also signaled the upcoming debt showdown in remarks following his re-election , saying that taming debt was the most important thing for restoring long - term @entity70 economic health			1
" at $ 16 trillion and rising , our national debt is draining free enterprise and weakening the ship of state			0
@entity208 is in peril so long as its namesake is weighed down by this anchor of debt			0
break its hold , and we begin to set our economy free , " he said			0
@entity56 , under fire from some conservatives , re-elected speaker @entity27 had stern words for the 113th @entity4 , warning lawmakers that he will not tolerate the kind of prolonged brinksmanship that defined the fiscal cliff saga			1
" while i will negotiate over many things , i will not have another debate with this @entity4 over whether or not they should pay the bills that they 've already racked up through the laws that they 've passed , " he said shortly after the @entity57 passed the fiscal cliff bill			1
@entity27 calls for less ' drama , ' ' brinkmanship ' senate minority leader @entity231 responded sharply in an opinion piece for @entity233 , insisting that spending would be part of the debate over the debt ceiling			1
the incoming freshman class took notes on failures of the previous @entity4 in hopes of avoiding a repeat performance			2
incoming freshmen " learned a lot from what happened over the last few weeks with the fiscal cliff debacle , " freshman @entity245 @entity244 rep. @entity243 said on @entity1 , adding that the takeaway for a lot of his class is to strengthen bipartisan ties			2
" a lot of us come in with that mind frame , " he said			0
@entity257 : debt debate ' starts today ' @entity1 's @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity263 contributed to this report .			0
