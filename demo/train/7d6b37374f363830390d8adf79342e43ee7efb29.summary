-- in the 1950s , i was almost gang - molested by a group of male fellow high school students			1
the incident took place one afternoon in the basement basketball court of the nearby @entity7 , of which i was a member			1
i had recently invited one member of the group to what i thought was an innocent get - together at a local square dance			1
i supposed later that they thought " i wanted it			2
" as i remember the incident , after some friendly play in the gym , the guys ( four of them ) turned on me , holding the ball as if i were the basket			1
the look on their faces terrified me			0
i ducked under their outstretched arms and ran , all the way home without looking back			0
i never mentioned the incident until 1983 , when i spoke at a rally supporting a student of mine who was gang - raped at a fraternity party			1
the rape case unraveling in @entity33 , @entity34 , brought back memories of my own frightening experience			1
i did n't know what was happening that day when the four young men began looking at me differently			0
i only knew that i had to get away as soon as possible			0
in the @entity33 case , a girl purportedly passed out and was allegedly sexually assaulted by two young men on the high school football team while others watched			1
what strikes me about the incident is that it demonstrates a split in the boy rape - prone sexual culture			1
some young men continue to believe that when a girl gets drunk , staging a sexual spectacle for their mates is part of a night 's fun			1
they do n't think of it as rape			2
some of their buddies , however , disagree			0
in their transition to manhood , they are able to name rape when they see it			2
this split opinion is illustrated in the video posted a few days ago by @entity67 showing a young man -- presumably an eyewitness -- egged on by others , telling his version of what happened			1
the video footage is disturbing , to say the least			2
he repeats in a litany format that the girl is dead			0
however , he does n't mean lifeless , except in the sense that she is n't moving			0
" how do you feel on a dead girl ? " he asks someone in the room			0
he describes her as " deader than a doornail			0
" when asked " how do you know she 's dead ? " he answers that she is dead because she is n't moving			2
he then goes on to describe how dead : " deader than @entity87 's son ... deader than @entity88 ... deader than @entity90 's wife ... deader than f * * * ing @entity92 ... deader than @entity93			2
" in other words , made only for use by men			0
in the cacophony of voices spurring him on , one hears the word " rape " from one or two other voices			2
one says , " this is not funny , " only to be drowned out by the laughter of the main speaker and those supporting him			0
when asked " what if that was your daughter ? " he answers , " if that was my daughter , i would n't care			0
i 'd just let her be dead			0
" besides , he says , " is it really rape because you do n't know if she wanted to or not , " the teenager says on the video			1
" she might have wanted to			0
" in response , the onlooker says , " you are sick			0
" what happened in @entity33 that night in august seems to suggest that some sort of sexual assault took place , at least from this eyewitness account if the video is verified to be authentic			1
most rape laws in the @entity129 that sexual activity on a person who is incapacitated or unable to consent constitutes rape			1
one of the clauses of the @entity34 law states that sexual activity is not permissible when " the other person 's ability to resist or consent is substantially impaired because of a mental or physical condition or because of advanced age , and the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the other person 's ability to resist or consent is substantially impaired because of a mental or physical condition or because of advanced age			1
" the girl 's incapacity comes not just from the multiple mentions of her being dead in the video			1
there is also possibly a photo of her being dragged along held by her wrists and ankles by two boys			2
in the @entity160 , surveys administered from the early 1980s to the present indicate that 20 % to 25 % of female students say they have experienced nonconsensual sex by the age of 21			0
every year , a high - profile case of gang rape appears in the news			1
with each new report , many @entity160 react with shock			0
confronted with such cases , many explain it away , thinking or actually saying " she wanted it			0
" why do we think this way ? doing so is behind the strange idea of " legitimate rape			2
" when will our sexual culture change so that an inebriated girl ( or boy ) is protected rather than abused ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			1

a video shows boys talking about the alleged rape in @entity33 , @entity34
@entity189 : incident demonstrates a split in the boy rape - prone sexual culture
she says some boys stage a sexual spectacle for their mates as part of a night 's fun
@entity183 : other boys are able to name rape when they see it , as some do in the video
