-- written off by all and sundry as the most expensive flop in @entity5 history , @entity1 is seemingly back in business			1
four goals in two games have transformed the misfiring striker from the on - pitch personification of @entity12 's recent problems to perhaps the man who can earn @entity14 a bit more time in the club 's managerial hotseat			1
" i said before that if the team play well and create chances he will score goals , " @entity14 said after @entity1 netted twice in saturday 's 3 - 1 win at @entity19 -- @entity12 's first victory in eight @entity5 games			1
" it 's fair to say that we are watching a @entity1 with more confidence and belief			2
i was analyzing his movements and adjusting a few things			0
it 's a question of confidence and differences in movements			0
the most important thing is that he appears confident			0
" the victory kept @entity12 third ahead of sunday 's @entity41 -- seven points behind leaders @entity43 and four adrift of second - placed @entity46			1
it capped a week which started with @entity12 's embarrassing group - stage exit from the @entity50 and which will end with the squad traveling to @entity52 for the @entity53			1
@entity1 ended his two - month drought with two goals in wednesday 's 6 - 1 thrashing of @entity58 team @entity57 , but the next day he had an immediate reminder of his earlier struggles from the man he is seeking to follow as a @entity12 hero			1
@entity63 , back training with the club to keep fit for next month 's @entity65 , put on a lavish dinner for last season 's @entity50 - winning team -- spending a reported $ 1.3 million as he had special commemorative rings made for his former colleagues			2
@entity1 did not attend the affair laid on by the player who kept him out of the @entity12 starting lineup following his $ 80 million move from @entity75 -- @entity63 , the fan favorite who finally delivered the @entity77 title that owner @entity78 has always craved , with his last kick for the club before moving to @entity81			1
whether it served as a catalyst for saturday 's performance , only @entity1 knows , but the @entity86 international shrugged off the lethargy that followed his promising start to this season as he looked more like the man who starred for @entity14 at @entity75			1
@entity1 opened the scoring in the 11th minute from @entity93 's cross for his first in the @entity5 since october 6 , and made it 2 - 0 at halftime with his first successful penalty in @entity97 football after @entity98 tripped @entity99			1
@entity1 hit the crossbar soon after the break , but compatriot @entity102 followed up to score , and @entity19 dropped into the relegation zone despite a consolation from @entity105			2
it was @entity14 's first league win in four games since replacing the sacked @entity109 , a hugely unpopular appointment with the @entity12 fans			1
" @entity122 we are adjusting things , but if we have more confidence , with the quality we have we will win games , " said the @entity113 coach , who will now seek to repeat his 2010 @entity53 success with @entity115 -- after which he was promptly sacked having fallen out with players and officials at the @entity120 club			0
" it 's important to have an opportunity to win any trophy , but especially this one , " @entity14 said			2
" it was a great experience for me and i hope it will be for my players			0
i got to the final in 2005 and won the tournament in 2010			0
" @entity135 ended a four - match winless run by beating fifth - placed @entity138 2 - 0 thanks to two penalties from @entity141 -- the first coming after an apparent dive from fellow @entity113 midfielder @entity143			0
" there was zero contact , it was n't even close			0
i am not sure what the referee saw , " @entity138 manager @entity147 said			0
" it was a bad decision for us and obviously changed the shape of the afternoon			0
we knew the longer the game went the more pressure would come on @entity135			0
" @entity156 's team had dropped to 10th after last weekend 's defeat by @entity158 , but climbed back up to sixth as the @entity160 side bounced back from the midweek @entity50 loss to @entity162			2
@entity164 's 4 - 3 win at eighth - placed @entity158 was marred by the arrest of one of the home team 's fans for an alleged racist gesture			1
@entity164 's @entity171 defender @entity170 complained after being abused following a second - half goal from @entity173 that put @entity164 4 - 2 ahead			1
" within 10 minutes of the report the stewards had got hold of the tv footage , replayed it , identified the alleged person in question and within that period he was arrested for a racially aggravated public order offense , " said a @entity158 spokesman			2
" the matter is with the police , but from the club 's point of view we abhor racism and we have worked hard over the years to make this a family club			0
we will look into it and a further statement will follow in due course			0
" @entity113 striker @entity192 scored twice for @entity158 to move top of the @entity5 scoring charts with 12 , lifting him above @entity43 's @entity196 and @entity75 's @entity197			1
@entity1 now has six , and 11 in all competitions this season			0
@entity200 moved out of the bottom three for the first time this season , beating fellow promoted side @entity204 1 - 0 to be equal on points with @entity206 and @entity207			2
@entity206 drew 0 - 0 with mid-table @entity208 , while two goals from @entity210 earned @entity207 a 2 - 2 draw with bottom club @entity212			0
@entity212 set a new record of 16 @entity5 games without a win , beating @entity217 's unwanted mark from the 1993 - 94 season , as new manager @entity219 had to settle for a third successive draw despite taking a second - half lead through striker @entity222 following defender @entity224 's first - half equalizer .			1

@entity1 scores twice for the second time this week in @entity12 victory
@entity86 striker has ended two - month drought which *coincided* with team 's struggles
@entity12 's 3 - 1 win at @entity19 is first in @entity5 under new boss @entity14
@entity158 fan arrested for alleged racist gesture during 4 - 3 defeat by @entity164
