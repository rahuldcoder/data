-- the recent emergence in the @entity2 of " @entity3 , " sometimes called synthetic marijuana , is testing lawmakers to see if they 've been paying attention to the failures of marijuana prohibition and will respond to @entity3 with enlightened policy			1
the first stories on @entity3 , or " @entity3 , " broke out with headlines labeling the mixture of herbs and spices , which are treated with a synthetic compound , as " fake pot. " @entity3 was virtually unknown until the media hyped up its presence at tobacco and novelty shops			1
under @entity2 law , and in all 50 states , the herbal product is legal , and also unregulated			0
people who have tried @entity3 often report psychoactive effects that are comparable to marijuana , but notably less pleasurable			1
when lawmakers consider regulating @entity3 , they should keep in mind that the government has waged a futile war against marijuana and people who use the drug for decades			1
for another opinion , click here elected officials have burned through billions of taxpayer dollars chasing marijuana sellers , bagging marijuana plants and jailing marijuana users			2
government - funded media campaigns have sought to scare children and adults away from marijuana with grossly exaggerated claims that using the drug will lead to death and mayhem			2
despite all of these efforts , the public has largely dismissed the myths and hysteria around marijuana and recognized that the drug has important medicinal benefits			2
moreover , public opinion is leaning in favor of a regulated and taxed market for marijuana			2
researchers who have tested @entity3 identified synthetic chemicals that are thought to mimic the psychoactive component in marijuana			1
these chemicals are thought to act on the cannabinoid receptors in the brain much the way that @entity68 -- the principal psychoactive component in marijuana -- operates			0
what 's notable about these synthetic chemicals is that very little is known about them , and this legal alternative designed to deliver an experience like marijuana may actually carry more risk			0
thus we have a supreme irony of drug prohibition : the government continues to criminalize marijuana -- a drug with established medical value that has undergone exhaustive study -- and entrepreneurs introduce a legal alternative to marijuana with ingredients scientists know little about			0
given this potential for harm , and the growing volume of sensational media portrayals of @entity3 , some lawmakers have ignored the lessons learned from marijuana prohibition and moved to criminalize possession and sales of @entity3			1
lawmakers in @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 have already written legislation to ban the herbal mix. it seems that a reporter need only write an article about an obscure bag of twigs to spur a lawmaker to criminalize more chemicals and the people who use them			0
time and time again , elected officials have dropped the ball when it comes to regulating drugs			0
lawmakers have preferred to lazily pass the responsibility of controlling a drug on to law enforcement and the criminal justice system			0
the problem is , we know from marijuana prohibition that law enforcement has no control over the drug market and the criminals who run it			0
criminalizing @entity3 will only worsen the devastating harm our society already suffers under drug prohibition			1
rather than regulation of the supply and ingredients of @entity3 , criminalization leaves the question of what goes into the product up to drug dealers			1
rather than passing regulations that bar k2 sales to minors , criminalizing @entity3 will essentially give dealers the green light to sell the product to whomever they please			1
by choosing to ban @entity3 outright , lawmakers will also forfeit badly needed state revenue from @entity3 sales and instead commit millions of taxpayer dollars to investigate , prosecute and jail @entity3 users			1
plus , researchers point out that hundreds of other known synthetic chemicals will easily reach store shelves once @entity3 is banned			2
the sensible legislative response to @entity3 is to create effective regulatory controls on sale and possession			0
@entity157 and @entity158 have passed model legislation that formally regulates and taxes adult sales of salvia divinorium -- another product with psychoactive properties -- and criminalizes salvia sales to minors			0
lawmakers should deliver a knockout to prohibition and pass laws that will actually regulate and control @entity3			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			0

@entity172 : " @entity3 , " sometimes called synthetic marijuana , should be regulated for *safety*
but , he says , lawmakers must not *duplicate* *costly* , futile war against marijuana
criminalizing the treated herbal mix @entity3 will turn trade over to drug dealers , @entity172 writes
@entity172 : regulating @entity3 generates revenue , saves millions on prosecution of users
