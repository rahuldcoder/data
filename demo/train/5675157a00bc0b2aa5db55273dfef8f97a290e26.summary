@entity0 -- their relationship may have become fraught during the 2013 @entity5 season , so just how does @entity7 chairman @entity6 rate the efforts of his star driver @entity9 ? " a good eight out of 10 , " @entity10 told @entity1 as he reflected on a season where @entity7 has played second fiddle to the all - conquering @entity14 team			1
the @entity7 chairman resorted to " tweaking " his @entity23 driver 's ear earlier this season after the double world champion appeared to criticize the team 's @entity18 car at july 's @entity20			1
but any tension between the two seems to have eased , with @entity10 awarding @entity9 the eight mark for his performance this year and comparing him to some of @entity7 's greatest ever drivers			1
" i think he 's really a very , very good driver , " @entity10 told @entity1 ahead of the @entity30			1
" i 've been with drivers like @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 -- fantastic -- but @entity9 in the races is really fantastic			2
" @entity9 has been also very good in the races to understand when was necessary to push and when it was necessary to calm down to save the tires			2
" managing the tires proved difficult for most of the drivers on the grid in 2013 , with the exception being newly - crowned quadruple world champion @entity43			0
with the @entity14 maestro taking the checkered flag at each of the last eight grands prix -- a record - breaking run -- @entity9 has been left 145 points adrift of the @entity51 driver and in second place with one race left in the season			1
@entity9 's cause has not been helped by a series of events which led to the sport 's official tire supplier @entity60 ditching their 2013 rubber and reverting to the set it produced for the 2012 season			1
however , @entity10 refused to blame the tires for a run which has seen @entity7 fail to win a race since may 's @entity68 -- " i never like to use the word ' excuse ' " -- preferring to focus on the success the team enjoyed in the opening rounds of the championship			1
" the first half of the season we won two races , so @entity7 was far more competitive , " explained the 66 - year - old			1
" this is a fact ... when the tires were changed we paid a big price			0
" i do n't like the formula in which a driver has to be careful not to destroy the tires			0
" while happy with the performance of @entity9 , who will be partnered by @entity87 in 2014 when the @entity88 returns to the team with which he won the drivers ' title in 2007 , @entity10 was unable to contain his disappointment with the progress the team has made off the track			2
" why i am not happy this year is that we have n't been able to develop the car after a very good start of the season , " he said			0
" so that was our problem			0
" the 2014 season will see a raft of rule changes , most significantly the mandatory use of a 1.6 liter turbocharged v6 engine which incorporates energy recovery systems			0
@entity107 , which stores up energy created while braking to provide cars with extra power , is an energy recovery system which is already used in the sport			0
" i am very happy to change rules , because i do n't like formulas which aerodynamic means 90 % of the performance , " said @entity10 , who hopes @entity7 can capitalize on its wealth of automotive design expertise			2
" we are not building aeroplanes or satellites , we 're building cars			0
" engine , gearbox , suspensions : these are also crucial , particularly for us , because - as we said - our experience in @entity5 means to transfer technology to our cars			0
