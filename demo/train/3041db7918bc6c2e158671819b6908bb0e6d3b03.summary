-- @entity3 gov. @entity2 's suggestion that the @entity4 may send troops to fight @entity7 drug cartels riled officials and spurred debate from analysts on both sides of the border monday			1
@entity7 's top representative in the @entity4 rejected the idea , which the @entity16 presidential candidate mentioned at a @entity18 campaign stop saturday			1
@entity7 ambassador @entity19 told reporters his country 's longstanding opposition to the presence of @entity4 forces had not changed			1
" the matter of the participation or presence of @entity4 troops on @entity7 soil is not on the table , " @entity19 said monday			1
" it is not a component that forms part of the innovative approaches that @entity7 and the @entity4 have been using to confront transnational organized crime			2
" @entity2 said saturday that leaders from @entity7 and the @entity4 should meet after next year 's elections to address the deadly drug trade			1
" it may require our military in @entity7 working in concert with them to kill these drug cartels and to keep them off of our border , " he said			2
analysts in the @entity4 and @entity7 said the controversial idea could have significant political consequences and security implications -- even as a political campaign proposal			1
" it may be well - intentioned , but it has the potential of really undermining cooperation between the @entity4 and @entity7 , " said @entity50 , who studies security relationships between the neighboring countries at the @entity53 of the @entity54 in @entity55			1
the @entity4 admits its drug market plays a role in fueling violence in @entity7 , and has pledged $ 1.4 billion in assistance through the so - called @entity64 , which includes programs to help train @entity7 military , police and justice officials			1
" if there 's a perception in @entity7 that this is all designed somehow as a backdoor entry into @entity7 by the @entity4 , if there 's a perception that this is leading to the @entity4 ' direct intervention into @entity7 , it puts at risk all those cooperative efforts , " @entity69 said			2
@entity78 -- author of " @entity7 : @entity81 and a @entity82 ? " -- described @entity2 's proposal as " absolute , unadulterated nonsense			2
" " the first thing you 'd have to fight is the @entity85 if you sent troops in there			0
it 's ludicrous , " he said			0
even if they do n't gain traction , @entity2 's comments will likely resonate in campaign rhetoric beyond the @entity4 ' borders , as presidential campaigns in @entity7 are also kicking into high gear , @entity78 said			2
" typically this is a time of nationalism and breast - beating by candidates			0
... the politicians are the ones who are going to walk all over it			0
they 're going to say , ' see , the gringos are coming after us , ' " he said			0
several @entity7 lawmakers -- who the country 's constitution says would need to approve any presence of @entity4 soldiers -- expressed concern about @entity2 's comments monday			1
@entity114 sen. @entity113 said @entity4 troops in @entity7 would be a clear " aggression			1
" " we must make an effort to face our own challenge , the violence of the criminals and the organized crime groups , but with our own forces and always maintaining the control of our territory , " said sen. @entity117 of the left - wing @entity118			0
but security analyst @entity129 said when it comes to @entity4 involvement , some @entity7 officials are prone to double speak -- allowing @entity4 - led measures to occur even as they speak out against them			1
earlier this year @entity7 's foreign minister fielded questions from angry lawmakers who said @entity4 surveillance of @entity7 territory -- aimed at detecting criminal groups -- was illegal			1
" there is interference ... and this has been said publicly			0
but i ask myself what has been accomplished by ceding a certain amount of authority , " @entity129 said			0
@entity2 , who was first elected governor of @entity3 in 2002 , has faced criticism from opponents who have attacked his conservative bona fides on illegal immigration at a series of debates this fall			2
" he 's trying to compensate and say , ' yeah , i 'm really tough on @entity7 , ' but i think he 's overcompensated , " said @entity78 , who is also a professor of government at the @entity155 in @entity156 , @entity157			0
this is n't the first time @entity2 has called for greater force fighting drug cartels			2
last year he asked @entity4 president @entity162 to send 1,000 additional @entity164 troops to the border			0
" we must show the cartels that @entity55 will no longer tolerate their terrorizing and criminalizing the border region , " he wrote in a letter to the president			0
troops crossing the border , however , is a different matter , @entity69 said			0
" no @entity7 wants the @entity4 to send its military troops			1
... they welcome cooperation and they welcome the @entity4 accepting responsibility for its role , but they do n't welcome the notion of sending troops			1
that 's crossing a line , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity185 and @entity186 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity3 governor says fighting the drug trade " may require our military in @entity7 "
@entity7 's ambassador says the presence of @entity4 troops " is not on the table "
the idea could have serious political and security consequences , analysts say
