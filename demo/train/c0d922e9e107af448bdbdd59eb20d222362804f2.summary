-- foreign diplomatic missions in @entity2 face an ominous decision after @entity4 said friday it could not guarantee the safety of embassies and international organizations in the event of armed conflict			1
tensions on the @entity11 remain in a heightened state amid new reports that @entity2 has prepared missiles for launch , while @entity16 has deployed naval destroyers to its coasts			1
the @entity19 said @entity2 told @entity21 officials that it would not be able to guarantee the safety of diplomats in the capital if fighting breaks out			2
several diplomatic missions said the @entity2 held a meeting friday for ambassadors in which they asked whether anyone needed assistance in evacuating their personnel			2
" we are consulting international partners about these developments , " the @entity19 said in a written statement			0
" no decisions have been taken , and we have no immediate plans to withdraw our embassy			0
" a spokesman for @entity42 's ministry of foreign affairs said the @entity2 " did not urge us or ask us to evacuate , " but offered assistance for those who wanted to leave			1
the @entity45 in @entity2 acts " as the @entity48 ' interim protecting power and provides basic consular services to @entity48 citizens traveling in @entity2 , " according to the @entity46			1
the @entity42 embassy remains open and operational , the spokesman said			0
@entity54 state media reported a more specific suggestion for its diplomats			0
@entity2 asked the @entity54 embassy to consider a possible evacuation of its staff because of the tensions , @entity57 , spokesman for the embassy , told @entity54 state media			1
@entity65 's foreign ministry state it was taking the situation " seriously			2
" it said it had no current plans for evacuations of personnel or @entity65 nationals in the country			2
the developments come as two medium - range missiles have been loaded onto mobile launchers on the @entity77 of @entity2 , a @entity48 official told @entity0 on friday			1
a second @entity48 official said intelligence on that is not definitive			1
the account followed a report by @entity16 's semi-official @entity84 news agency , citing military sources in @entity86 , that the two missiles were ready to be launched			0
@entity84 said the missiles have been hidden in an unidentified facility			0
in response , @entity16 has sent @entity92 destroyers equipped with advanced radar systems to both of its coasts , @entity84 said , citing navy sources			0
the @entity48 would " not be surprised " if @entity2 launched a missile , @entity99 spokesman @entity98 said friday			1
" we have seen them launch missiles in the past and the @entity106 @entity105 has repeatedly condemned them as violations of the @entity2 's obligations under numerous @entity105 resolutions			1
" new regional tensions were triggered by @entity2 saber rattling , including threats to launch nuclear strikes , and the flexing of military prowess by the @entity48 and @entity16 in response			1
these followed the imposition of stepped up @entity106 sanctions against the @entity121 after its latest nuclear test in february			0
@entity2 has also said it planned to restart " without delay " a reactor at its main nuclear complex that it shut down five years ago as part of a deal with the @entity48 , @entity127 and four other nations			1
most observers say the @entity2 is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile			2
and many analysts say the increasingly belligerent talk is aimed at cementing the domestic authority of @entity2 leader @entity137			0
a @entity46 spokeswoman said thursday the situation did " not need to get hotter , " reflecting efforts by the @entity142 administration to ease its rhetoric and cool tensions			2
but the latest developments by @entity2 , which has accused the @entity48 of pushing the region to the " brink of war , " could signal a missile launch soon , officials have said			1
the missile components , @entity48 and @entity16 officials have said , are consistent with those of a @entity155 missile , which has a 2,500 - mile range , meaning it could threaten @entity16 , @entity158 and @entity159			2
@entity48 reducing rhetoric that feeds @entity2 rhetoric it is believed a missile launch would be a " test " launch rather than a targeted strike			1
that is because it appears the @entity2 have only moved the components so far			0
the @entity48 is waiting to see whether @entity2 issues a customary notice to its airmen and mariners to stay out of the region			1
communication intercepts in recent days also seem to show that @entity4 might be planning to launch a mobile ballistic missile in the coming days or weeks , another @entity48 official said			1
key dates in @entity48 military moves near @entity2 wednesday , the @entity48 announced it was sending ballistic missile defenses to @entity180 , a @entity181 territory that is home to @entity48 naval and air bases			1
@entity2 has cited those bases when listing possible targets for missile attacks			2
@entity2 : our global fear and fascination @entity192 officials , while decrying @entity2 rhetoric , said recent announcements of @entity48 military deployments in response to belligerent statements by @entity4 may have contributed to the escalating tensions			1
as the bombast reaches a fever pitch , the @entity48 is refining its message			0
the @entity192 now says it is working to decrease the temperature as it maintains a frank and vigilant stance toward the threats			0
photos : painting a picture of @entity2 starting wednesday , @entity2 also barred @entity16 workers and managers from entering the @entity209 industrial complex , an economic cooperation zone that sits on the @entity2 's side of the border but houses operations of scores of @entity16 companies			0
it also repeated a threat from the weekend to shut down the complex , where more than 50,000 @entity2 work			0
