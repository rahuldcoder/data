no need for a double - take : the name may be the same , but the person answering to it is n't			2
@entity1 had booked his - and - her airline tickets in his name -- and his girlfriend 's , he said			1
so , after his ex went overboard , he had to find a new co-passenger with the same name , he said , because the tickets were non-transferable			2
@entity1 is @entity18 , as is his ex , so the new @entity3 needed to be , too , to make the switch work			1

@entity26 from @entity27 quickly tweeted @entity1 a photo of her passport			1
scrawled on the shot in hot pink , the words " take me ! ! ! " he did , he announced on wednesday , but though " @entity35 " came at him straight out of the chute , making the final choice was n't that simple , @entity1 said in a statement			1
many deserving women had contacted him			0
founded charity some of their stories told of such compelling real - life heartbreak and perseverance , that @entity1 started a crowd - funding initiative , @entity44 , to buy trips around the world for them , too			1
the first four he hopes to fund are a victim of @entity50 , a single mother with an autistic son , and two women who fled violence in their native countries			0
but @entity1 settled on @entity35 from @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity27 , as his travel partner			2
he said she stood out with her volunteer work at a homeless shelter and her wish to become a social worker			0
from the get - go , @entity1 told prospective @entity65 's that he would put no pressure on them to do him any favors			1
he was not looking for his ex 's doppelganger to mend a broken heart			0
" i am not looking for anything in return			0
i am not looking for companionship , romance , drugs , a trade , or to take selfies with you in front of the @entity81 in @entity82 , " he wrote			0
but he had nothing against a few bills to sooth the financial pain			0
" if you feel compelled to toss me a couple hundred bucks , great			0
really the only thing i ask for is that you enjoy this trip and that it bring you happiness			0

from there , the two will hop to @entity82 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and back to @entity1 's home of @entity100 , provided @entity18 authorities allow the new @entity3 to board with the ticket booked for the ex. @entity0 has reached out to the @entity104 to find out whether they have any security measures in place that would prevent @entity3 2.0 from traveling .			1
