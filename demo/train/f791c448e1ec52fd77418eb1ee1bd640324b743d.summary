former president of @entity1 , @entity0 , was a founder of the solidarity trade union group that helped bring about about the downfall of communism in @entity1 in 1989			1
he won the @entity5 in 1983 and was the country 's president from 1990 to 1995			1
his eponymous @entity8 was set up in 1995 to support concepts of independence , ethics and state decentralization			2
@entity13 asked him about his recollections from 25 years ago and his thoughts on the future of @entity1			1
@entity13 : what are you strongest memories from this time 25 years ago ? @entity0 : i prefer to look at today and tomorrow			1
sometimes , however , it 's good to take a look back to learn a lesson from the past			1
there have been so many events with influence on the present time that they form a chain of events reaching back much further than 1989			1
it all dates back to 1970 , when the social discontent reached its peak and forced many of us to take to the streets			2
next , we witnessed the election of @entity38 to the @entity39 , the @entity40 , the creation of @entity42 , the imposition of martial law , the @entity45 , the partially - free election in 1989 , then my presidency as a seal of freedom and lastly the admission of @entity1 to @entity51 and to the @entity52			1
i consider all these elements to be consecutive links in the chain of freedom , without which neither @entity1 nor @entity57 would be free			1
@entity13 : what was the biggest challenge you faced personally during your days with @entity42 before 1989 ? @entity0 : the most important one was to persevere in unity			1
to stick to our goal			2
not to be broken down			2
and yet we were so badly impacted by martial law			2
in prison we went through an ordeal			2
we were not broken down			2
our faith was never shaken			2
it was strengthened by what happened in august 1980			2
this is our great victory			2
at that time , nobody expected us to succeed			1
we had a vivid memory of the tragic events of december 1970			2
we knew we had to work together			2
already on the first day we set up an @entity76 and started to work on the demands			2
we eventually managed to hammer out 21 demands , which were signed on december 31st together with the government , which was represented by @entity80			2
this was our greatest challenge and greatest victory			2
soon after , our tiny union had 10 million members all over @entity1			1
the 1980s were a time of struggle to build an organization and its structures			1
it was also a fight for unity and perseverance in the path we had chosen			2
although weakened , we were not defeated and so we lasted until 1988 and 1989			2
we lost a couple of battles , but we won the war for democracy and freedom			1
it 's because we were working in solidarity			1
and the world was in solidarity with us			0
@entity13 : what gave you the strength to continue the struggle against the communist government in @entity1 ? what qualities do you think you had that made you do what you did ? @entity0 : this is made up of several things			1
one of them was our faith that this sick , unfair system must finally collapse			0
we did n't know how to make it happen , how to get organized so as not to repeat the mistakes made in 1970 ( during the protests )			0
in my opinion , divine providence helped us at this stage			0
it 's then that a pole who became pope helped us to organize ourselves in prayer and also made us understand our inner strength			1
his regular visits to @entity1 , although hindered by the communist authorities , played this role			1
the masses celebrated by the @entity133 gathered millions of @entity1			1
we could see that we were many , that we were millions			0
before that , we had been scattered and divided			0
it was the first time in post-war @entity1 that the @entity1 nation had joined forces on such a massive scale			1
i 'm sure that had there been no pontificate of @entity38 , the @entity139 would n't have happened as quickly or as peacefully as it did			0
the holy father did not call us to fight , but gathered us in prayer			0
and we were able to match actions with words			0
@entity13 : do you have any regrets from your life during the anti-communist days ? @entity151 : concerning our peaceful struggle , i have no regrets whatsoever			1
of course , when i look at it today , from the perspective of years , i wish i had done a few things differently , but as for the path we took , i would n't have changed it			0
despite such a great victory , i have a feeling that i missed something			0
when i was fighting , when i was repeatedly arrested and in prison or when i traveled all over the country to coordinate the activity of unions , my wife and the children were left behind at home			0
regrettably , i was not with them			0
it 's probably my greatest failure : i was not with my family when they needed me most			1
for this i want to thank my wife @entity174			0
for the fact that she put up with me and brought up our children to be good people			0
@entity13 : how do you see @entity1 today ? @entity0 : we are now in a very different place , in a new era			1
today we can say with confidence that we live in a democratic @entity1 , in a firmly established free market economic system , in a country built on solid foundations of international cooperation and in a country of high aspirations and hopes for further development			1
our success has been noticed			0
there are many who point to @entity1 as an example of wise economic policy			1
we are amongst the few countries that emerged from the financial crisis relatively unscathed			0
the 2012 @entity200 was another type of promotion of @entity1 and an opportunity to show off our achievements			1
i 'm also very happy to see that even those projects , which seemed doomed to failure due to the very last decisions of the communists , have in fact been able to be saved , such as my beloved @entity211 , the cradle of " @entity42 "			1
today it is slowly rising to its feet again and building ships after many years of struggle and hope for its rescue ; there is a chance that jobs can be safeguarded and that the symbol of the @entity1 transformation can be saved			1
this fills me with happiness , even if the costs of transformation were high			0
today @entity1 is a truly beautiful , modern and open country			1
@entity13 : is it the country today as you hoped it would be when you cast your vote in june 1989 ? @entity0 : back in 1989 , nothing was a foregone conclusion			1
we had to build a state system almost from scratch			0
the difficult ( political and economic ) reforms of minister of finance @entity236 and the prime minister @entity238 allowed us to make further changes			0
in conjunction with @entity242 , i negotiated the withdrawal of @entity245 troops from @entity1			1
we then became a member of the @entity51 and today we are also a member of the @entity52			0
at that time , i did n't even dream that we would manage to achieve all that , and in such a short time			1
it 's true , @entity1 as we see it today is beyond anything we could have dreamt of at that time			1
however , i regret that not everything worked out as it should have			0
my presidency ended after five years and i had a plan that would have required two terms to fully realize			0
later on , the politics of @entity257 were not in line with my concept			0
@entity13 : do you think democracy in @entity1 and other former communist states is in good shape ? @entity0 : it might seem so , but we still have a problem with the sense of responsibility for the country amongst our citizens			1
we recently held the election to the @entity272 , a very important election , in which decided who would be representing us at the @entity52			0
the average turnout throughout the @entity52 was low -- only 43 %			0
in @entity1 , however , it stood at 23 %			1
and even lower than that in @entity278 and in the @entity279			0
first we expect " old @entity57 " to accept us and treat us on an equal footing and then we renounce our right to vote			0
moreover , parties with extremist views are on the rise			0
these parties promote ideas that contradict democracy and the @entity52 's reason for existence			1
we must therefore wake up , because if we continue to be indifferent , we may ourselves destroy our great dream of international solidarity			0
on the other hand , i 'm a 100 % democrat and if parties with such an outlook on life enter the parliament , i have no choice but to accept it			0
i only call for votes during the next election to be cast in a well - conceived manner			1
@entity13 : what is the biggest challenge facing @entity1 and @entity1 society today ? @entity0 : the biggest challenge for @entity1 , @entity57 and the world is the reshuffling and widening of structures			1
i have already been saying it for quite some time : we must evolve past thinking in terms of the nation state and the @entity57 state			1
we live in an era of intellect , information and globalization			0
we live under new conditions that require us to create a totally different set of programs and structures			0
it 's a task not only for @entity1 , but also for the entire population of contemporary @entity57 and the world at large			1
our present systems do not meet our current needs			0
the new era offers us new challenges			0
we who destroyed communism , whose downfall has triggered a domino effect of transformation throughout @entity57 , should provide an example and inspiration for the entire world			0
we must show how to change even the most difficult reality through purely democratic means , without the use of violence			0
today we must ask ourselves which world we are going to built in this new era and how democracy and globalization are going to look			2
for a long time already , i have been calling for the development of a @entity350 of universal values that would serve as a lasting reference point for this new @entity57 and the world			2
we must define and accept laws establishing common principles , which would allow nations and religions to co-exist in a spirit of respect for differences and friendly cooperation			0
once such a universal basis is established , we will succeed in building lasting and safe communities			0
otherwise it may be hard to maintain the world as it is at present .			0
