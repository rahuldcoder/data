-- " gosh , i wan na be that guy again , " @entity0 would think when he remembered how it felt to be in shape			1
the 66 - year - old teacher was n't exactly accustomed to the extra pounds he was carrying around			1
he had been a marathoner before what he calls " bad teacher habits " crept into his life			1
as a high school teacher in @entity11 , @entity12 , he often skipped breakfast and lunch because of his schedule			1
then he would consume between 5,000 and 6,000 calories after 6 p.m. each night			2
" i would come home ravenous , " he said			2
" i could eat a large can of peanuts and whole bag of licorice in one fell swoop			2
" he began to gain weight in his 40s , and the pounds piled on for the next 15 years			1
by the age of 62 , @entity0 was at his heaviest weight of 465 pounds			1
at 6 - foot - 4 , his body mass index was 56.6			2
( anything over 30 is considered obese			0
) " i had a 25 - inch neck , a 66 - inch waist , " he told @entity4 affiliate @entity29			0
" i could n't shop at normal stores			0
" the breaking point while visiting his daughter and new grandson in @entity37 during the summer of 2010 , @entity0 experienced a wake - up call			1
his family was walking up a small hill on the way to a community pool			0
@entity0 took one look at the incline and knew he could n't make it			1
he watched his family disappear into the distance			0
" i did n't cry , but i had tears in my eyes , " he admits			0
that 's when he decided , " this is not going to be my life with my grandchildren			2
" @entity0 knew he needed to make a serious change , but after several previous failed attempts at dieting he needed a lasting solution			1
so @entity0 and his wife , @entity56 , began looking into weight - loss options			1
after a few months and several consultations , they decided on gastric sleeve surgery -- a restrictive operation that makes the stomach smaller			1
he feared he would only gain the weight back			0
but his daughter encouraged him to see the surgery as a tool , rather than an overnight solution			2
he had the procedure in january 2011			0
for two weeks before and after his surgery , he was on a clear liquid diet , which he says washed bad food cravings out of his system			2
then he slowly began adding healthy foods into his diet			0
he added one new food per day , adhering to a schedule from his dietitian			0
today , he typically eats oatmeal for breakfast , a turkey wrap for lunch and lean meats with vegetables for dinner			0
combining smarter eating habits with regular exercise , @entity0 lost 70 pounds in the first six months after his surgery			1
he walked every other day at first , and now he alternates between walking and running			0
" when my children saw me for the first time , their jaws dropped , " @entity0 said			1
teacher of the year the shock was even greater when he returned to school the following semester			1
" my students were wowed , " he said			0
many of his students even joined him during his sunday afternoon walks			0
" we became each other 's cheerleaders			2
" the support he received from his class and family perpetuated his momentum			0
by the spring of 2013 , @entity0 had lost an awe - inspiring 270 pounds			1
these days , he 's proud to say he weighs around 180 pounds			1
" i wake up in the morning and i think to myself , ' there is no way i am going to fit in those pants , ' " he says			0
yet he takes the more pride in the energy he 's gained than in the way he looks			1
" it has resurrected my teaching career , " he said			0
" he 's always been a great teacher , " his wife , @entity56 , agrees			1
" i just think he has more energy to do more with his talent			2
" just three years after he was strongly considering retiring , @entity0 's newfound zest for both life and teaching made him the 2014 @entity121			1
now retirement is n't in his plans at all			0
" i have a surge of joy for what i 'm doing , " he says			0
" i 'm up every day at 4:30 a.m. "			0

high school teacher @entity0 was 465 pounds at his heaviest
he *underwent* gastric sleeve surgery and lost more than 270 pounds
