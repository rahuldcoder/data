-- your cooking partner is a robot , your fridge can talk , and your plate is your own personal dietician			1
oh , and for a laugh you occasionally have a cook - off with a famous holographic chef			1
this may sound like a scene from 1960s sci - fi cartoon @entity13 , but the kitchens in coming decades may not be so far off those envisioned by futurologists			2
today , a number of significant developments in culinary tech are happening in the field of robotics			2
@entity0 's blueprint team caught up with a group of design students in @entity25 who recently programmed an industrial robot -- usually tasked with building cars -- to cook			1

" says @entity42 , one of the students involved in the project			2
the ' let 's cook the future ' robot " prints " cookies three - dimensionally , building them up layer by layer in almost any shape you could imagine			1
@entity54 , an industrial designer working alongside the students says that the project looks towards a future where people can make dishes that are only limited by their imagination			2
" the problem we are addressing in this project is the need for personalization of production ... at the moment we can observe that people need more personalization , more customization of products than before and now it 's possible			2
" @entity71 , a respected @entity25 designer , ceramicist and visiting professor at the @entity74 , @entity75 , says that he was " amazed " by the students ' robot chef but felt that " we simply do n't know where this is going ... how will we relate to objects made completely by a machine ? how will these objects relate to our emotions ? where will the relationship between person and object be when the object is made by a machine ? " the introduction of robots into the home is not new , of course			1
many of us already live with electronics that have robotic components , such as self - cleaning ovens , single - touch microwaves that automatically adjust to the food you have put in them , and fridges that scan used - by dates			1
the trend for robots to perform unskilled restaurant jobs has also led to robotic noodle slicers and mechanical waiters , though so far many are mere gimmicks rather than genuine technological solutions			0
@entity109 , design director at @entity111 , says that he thinks there is a place for robots in the kitchen : " i think kitchen robots could potentially take over some of the common jobs that are repetitive or difficult to do ... i think you could take away some of the boring chores and spend your time doing something more interesting			0
" away from robotics , @entity111 has been exploring the creative fringe of kitchen design with its annual @entity125 competition			0
the company recently announced the semi-finalists for 2013 , which include a @entity129 food printer and an appliance that calculates the nutritional values , possible toxins and freshness of your food before you start cooking			0
@entity109 says the range of issues being tackled by students in the competition is fascinating in itself : " a lot of the students are addressing issues like wellbeing , robotics , bio-mimicry , wearable devices , air purification , and also using smart phones and tablets as remote controls			1
and then there are the issues about food diagnostics , which are especially interesting in light of the horse meat scandal			0
people are no longer that concerned about what frying pan they use , but what is in the frying pan			0
knowing what it is that you are eating is very important			0
" with work being done in almost every field of home design , it is likely that the kitchen of the future will look significantly different to how it does today			0
as the old saying goes , the kitchen will always be the heart of the home -- but increasingly that heart is coming to resemble a pacemaker .			0

students at @entity25 's @entity179 have developed a robotic chef
robot creates *3d* - printed cookies in almost any shape imaginable
