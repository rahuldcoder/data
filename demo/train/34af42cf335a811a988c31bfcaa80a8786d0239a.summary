@entity1 at least a dozen people have been detained in the @entity1 region in connection with last week 's shootings , the city prosecutor 's office said friday			1
the people arrested are suspected of providing logistical support for the attacks			1
the arrests were made in the @entity14 and @entity15 neighborhoods , and those arrested were in @entity18 's entourage , the @entity1 prosecutor 's representative said			1
@entity18 was killed last friday in a police siege to end a hostage taking at a kosher supermarket in @entity1			1
he had killed four hostages and is believed to have shot a policewoman to death in the city a day earlier			0
two days before @entity18 was killed , brothers @entity27 and @entity28 had attacked the offices of satirical magazine @entity30 , killing 12 people and injuring 11			1
they died the same day as @entity18 as police moved in to end a separate siege			0
there does not appear to be a command - and - control element to the @entity1 attacks other than a general " go forward and do something , " a @entity39 official with direct knowledge told @entity2 , describing the attack as " highly franchised terrorism with general instructions			1
" the @entity28 brothers " legitimately aligned with @entity45 " and @entity28 was associated with networks that brought him to @entity48 to train with the terror group , but @entity18 's alleged connection with @entity51 is still unclear , the official said			1
investigators are still trying to determine whether @entity18 coordinated with the @entity28 brothers in the execution of the attacks or launched his own attack after learning of their actions , said the @entity39 official			2
who were the victims ? @entity61 's frayed nerves will not be eased by the @entity64 authorities ' operation thursday to dismantle a suspected terror cell believed to be on the brink of carrying out attacks on police			1
however , investigators have so far found no links with events in @entity1 , @entity64 prosecutor @entity69 said			1
meanwhile , in the @entity61 city of @entity75 , about 90 miles ( 145 kilometers ) northeast of @entity1 , the @entity73 confirmed friday that a police operation had taken place and that there had been gunfire			1
it 's not clear whether this is related to the investigation of the @entity1 attacks			1
however , @entity75 was the hometown of @entity85			0
at the same time , a man with a handgun entered a post office in @entity89 , a northwestern suburb of @entity1 , according to the local police department			1
police said the man might be mentally unstable and that they did not know yet if this was terror - related			0
according to @entity61 media , there are up to five hostages inside the post office			0
in his first visit to @entity61 since last week 's terror attacks , @entity97 secretary of state @entity96 said that he " really wanted to come here and share a hug with all of @entity1 and all of @entity61			1
" standing alongside @entity1 mayor @entity102 , @entity96 added that he " wanted to express to you personally the sheer horror and revulsion " over what he called a " living nightmare			1
" @entity97 singer @entity108 also appeared , crooning a customized version of his 1971 hit song , " @entity111			1
" @entity96 met earlier with president @entity112 , when he voiced the " full and heartfelt condolences " of @entity97			1
" we watched the people of @entity61 come together with a great sense of purpose and unity			2
it was a great lesson to the world that once again , @entity61 's commitment to freedom and passion of ideas has made an important statement to the world , " @entity96 said			1
@entity96 laid a wreath at a makeshift memorial at the site of the kosher supermarket attack friday , accompanied by foreign minister @entity131			1
@entity96 and @entity131 spoke there for several minutes with @entity133 , the president of @entity1 , a national @entity135 organization			1
@entity96 and @entity131 also paid their respects at the offices of @entity30			1
@entity139 , the mayor of @entity1 ' 11th district , where the offices are located , told @entity2 that @entity96 's visit was very welcome			1
" it 's so important for us to feel supported at this time , " he said			2
the street is still cordoned off as investigators continue to comb the area for clues , adding to the sense of disquiet for local residents , he said			0
" we know that the threat is still very high , and we do n't know how long we will be able to withstand this threat , " he said			0
president @entity155 's administration has admitted it erred by not sending a senior figure to a huge unity march held sunday in @entity1			1
more than 40 world leaders , including the @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 heads of state and @entity164 's foreign minister , joined at least 1.5 million people on the @entity61 capital 's streets			1
the goodbyes continue after the attack on the @entity30 offices			0
funerals are being held for magazine editor @entity173 , illustrator @entity174 and @entity176 - born copy editor @entity175			0
the question of where to bury their killers is more contentious			0
@entity28 's widow , @entity181 , has requested that both he and his brother said @entity28 be buried in @entity183 , on the outskirts of @entity1			1
the @entity187 mayor 's office told @entity2 that the city was obliged by law to bury @entity28 there , as he was a resident of the city			2
but a spokesman for the mayor , @entity194 - @entity193 , said that it would not do the same for @entity27 because he lived in @entity75			0
" that 's for sure , he 's not from @entity183 , we wo n't let him get a funeral here , " @entity193 said			2
a " survivors ' issue " of @entity30 was published wednesday -- the first since the attack			0
copies have flown off the racks of newsstands despite a print run of more than 4 million			0
however , the magazine 's decision to run a cartoon of the @entity211 on the front cover -- not for the first time -- has been criticized by a number of @entity216 leaders , since this is deeply offensive to many @entity217			2
anger over the cartoon boiled over into violence friday in @entity220 , where police resorted to using tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters outside the @entity225 in @entity226			0
a @entity220 photographer for @entity229 was shot and injured at the protest , the @entity61 news agency reported			0
he is " doing better , " it said via @entity233			0
@entity234 , chief of @entity226 's @entity235 , told @entity2 that investigations were underway to determine who shot the journalist			2
at least 200 protesters were involved in the violence , which broke out after religious parties called supporters out to condemn the cartoon following afternoon prayers , @entity234 said			0
the protests come a day after @entity220 's @entity246 unanimously passed a resolution condemning the caricatures printed in @entity30			2
several @entity61 media outlets ' websites went down friday morning , including those of radio station @entity252 , newspapers @entity253 and 20 minutes , weekly magazines @entity256 and @entity257 , and investigative publication @entity258			0
this prompted speculation that the outage could be the result of a hack linked to publication of the @entity30 cover			0
but internet service provider @entity267 said it was not the result of a cyberattack			0
with @entity61 on its highest level of alert , 10,000 troops have deployed across the country			0
thousands of police officers are on patrol , including hundreds assigned to protect @entity135 schools			0
as @entity61 still reels from the shock of the @entity1 attacks , authorities in neighboring @entity64 swooped in on an alleged terror cell in an operation that left two suspects dead			1
prosecutor @entity69 said weapons and police uniforms were recovered as part of raids on a dozen properties in @entity64 , in which 13 people were arrested			1
the plan was to kill police officers on public roads or in police offices , he said			0
two people were also arrested in @entity61 , he said , and @entity64 will be asking for them to be extradited			2
they are @entity64 nationals who belong to the alleged cell but were found in @entity61 , he said			0
a @entity39 intelligence source told @entity2 that the ongoing terror threat appears to involve up to 20 sleeper cells of between 120 and 180 people ready to strike in @entity61 , @entity161 , @entity64 and the @entity303			2
@entity45 claimed responsibility wednesday for the @entity30 shooting			0
the attack was years in the making , @entity45 commander @entity306 said in a video , claiming @entity97 - born cleric @entity310 was the mastermind behind it			1
in the days since last week 's attacks , security services have been working to track those associated with the @entity28 brothers and @entity18			1
@entity317 , a suspected @entity64 trafficker in weapons who met @entity18 's widow , @entity317 , is in custody , @entity317 's attorney , @entity316 , told @entity2 on friday			2

according to @entity316 , police did n't find any weapons at @entity317 's house			2
