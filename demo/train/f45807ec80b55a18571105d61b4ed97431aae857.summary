@entity0 , @entity1 -- you are about to meet mr. @entity4			1
@entity5 and @entity6 -- a real - life couple -- star in " @entity9 " as father and daughter			1
he 's @entity5 , star of the @entity13 sitcom " @entity14			2
" to borrow a phrase from the network 's marketing -- he 's very funny			0
@entity5 's character -- " @entity19 " @entity4 -- is a lovable , sometimes outrageous and always off - the - wall senior citizen who has stolen every scene he 's entered in @entity23 's plays , movies and tv shows			1
mr. @entity4 no longer has to steal scenes , because @entity13 -- owned by @entity2 parent company @entity27 -- has ordered 80 episodes of half - hour comedy , based on the success of 10 pilot episodes			1
" just in case i 'm dreaming , do n't pinch me , " said @entity5			2
" i 'm living the dream			0
" " @entity9 " is a spinoff of @entity23 's " @entity35 , " a sitcom that has yielded strong cable ratings for @entity13 , and it employs some of the same characters seen in @entity23 's movies and stage plays -- including a play and film named " @entity9 , " which is only mildly related to the tv series			1
the show focuses on mr. @entity4 and his daughter @entity46 , played by @entity5 's real - life wife , @entity6 , as mr. @entity4 tries to turn his house into a home for the elderly			1
those who have followed @entity23 's productions know that @entity46 was the conceived during a brief fling between @entity4 and @entity55 , @entity23 's female alter ego			2
" if it had n't been for @entity46 , mr. @entity4 and @entity55 probably would have killed each other by now , " @entity5 said			1
" @entity46 is the glue to this whole thing			0
" @entity5 said mr. @entity4 's speech and mannerisms are from a combination of people			1
" grandfathers , uncles , relatives , you know , different friends you see			0
" i use to go to a nursing home and just look at people , watch -- ' ok , that 's how they 're doing this			0
' " his biggest laughs come from his use -- or abuse -- of the @entity79 language which @entity5 refers to as " mr. @entity80			2
" manipulate becomes " manipudip , " while hypnotize transforms to " hepatitis			0
" " you hear them as i spit them out , and it 's just like , ' what was i thinking ? ' " @entity5 said			2
mr. @entity4 's wardrobe , which is always two sizes too small for his protruding belly , is a bright - colored mix of thrift store specials			1
" the clothes just kind of happened , " he said			0
" because , you know , you have that uncle or that relative in your family who just ca n't let the clothes go ? " since mr. @entity4 originated on the stage -- in @entity23 productions -- @entity5 had to adjust to the small screen			1
" i 'm very animated and so i just had to make sure i toned that down for the screen because i 'm so used to making sure that the person in the front row can see as well as the person in the balcony , " he said			0
" to bring that and condense it down for television was a transition for me			0
" camera operators are challenged to keep up with @entity5 as he moves around the set , sometimes re-writing the script			2
" one word can trigger a whole different thing with us , and that 's what i love about working with @entity23 , " @entity5 said			2
" he gives you the freedom to go in there and create			0
if you see something that can make it funnier , he gives you the liberty to go ahead and do it , create it and make it funny			0
" @entity23 directs every episode at his new @entity0 studio on a sound stage next to where he also tapes " @entity35			0
" mr. @entity4 never seems too far from mr. @entity5			1
in mid-interview , he emerges			0
" oh , he can come out any time , " @entity5 , speaking as @entity4 , said			1
" all you got tuh do is say it , and he 'll come			0
@entity138 , mr. @entity4 is always ' round somewhere			1
you jes ' got tuh belieeeeeve			0
" the character is played about 30 years older than @entity5 , which causes some confusion out of costume and in public , he said			2
" what 's funny is when people see me out they 're like , ' are you mr. @entity4 's son ? ' no , i 'm mr. @entity4 , " he said			1
" but that 's good for the makeup team			0
" perhaps the most awkward time is when he is on the set , dressed as mr. @entity4 , and he wants to show his wife , @entity6 , some husbandly affection			1
" she is like , ' when you put that makeup on , you are mr. @entity4 , you 're not my husband			1
" so , she does n't want me kissing on her and stuff			0
she says ' it 's like a dirty old man kissing and hugging on me			0
' " you can also see mr. @entity4 in " @entity163 , " which hit theaters last month and has been a rousing success at the box office			1
" they finally got @entity55 , " @entity5 said			2
" she 's been to jail a few times , but this time @entity55 goes to prison -- or as mr. @entity4 would say , ' prisnuh			1
