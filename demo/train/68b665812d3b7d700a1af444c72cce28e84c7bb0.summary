@entity0 has just postponed their national elections by six weeks , now to be held on the 28th march			1
but this is no simple logistical delay -- the electoral commission announced they were ready for the vote			0
instead , the @entity0 military said they can not provide security across the country on voting day , and so forced the electoral commission to postpone the vote			1
the decision is extremely controversial as these elections are set to be the closest since @entity0 returned to democracy in in 1999 , after decades of coups and military rule			1
the military say they need to concentrate on a new offensive against the @entity19 militant group , @entity18 , in north - east @entity0			1
but it is likely no coincidence that the offensive comes after incumbent president @entity23 also pushed for a postponement of the elections			1
@entity0 's opposition party have called the postponement a " setback for democracy , " as they now fear the military 's decision to force the postponement threatens not only their momentum , but the election itself			1
but this is a problem not just for @entity0			1
@entity37 secretary of state , @entity38 , has released an unusually strong statement saying the @entity37 is " deeply disappointed			0
" he goes on : " political interference with the @entity42 is unacceptable , and it is critical that the government not use security concerns as a pretext for impeding the democratic process			1
" @entity37 - @entity0 relations are at a nadir , and at risk is @entity37 's relationship with one of its most important allies in a region threatened by one of the world 's most violent terrorist groups , @entity18			2
the intervention by the military is a serious blow not just to this election but also @entity0 's young democratic process			1
and it could n't happen at a more dangerous time			0
despite being one of the fastest growing economies in the world , @entity0 's oil dependent economy has been rocked by falling oil prices , with the worst performing stock market in @entity72 , record lows for the @entity76 currency , and depleted foreign exchange savings			2
but perhaps the biggest danger is @entity18 , which has made dramatic territorial gains over the past few months in the @entity79 , and despite the latest offensive to counter the threat , they continue to attack major strategic towns			0
the postponement brings new uncertainty and new dangers			0
in 2011 , over 1,000 people were killed in post-election violence after @entity23 's victory , as a @entity90 southerner , which was seen as illegitimate in the mostly northern , @entity19 region of the country			0
this time , people 's hopes , tempers and disillusionment are , if anything , even higher			0
@entity0 has an immense ability to absorb crises and the military 's direct threat to the electoral process has passed , not without comment , but without incident			2
but there are now six weeks to the election			2
the fear is that this is simply the quiet before the perfect storm			0
voters take to @entity111 as elections are delayed by @entity113 , for @entity1 upon hearing the news of the postponement , people in @entity72 's most populous country took to social media to voice their opinions			1
the decision was decried by many as a flawed and weak excuse , and with the date of march 28 tied to the caveat of an improvement in the security situation , some voiced concerns about the possibility of future delays			2
some believed president @entity132 was behind the delay , saying that he will now use the time to whip up extra support			0
whereas others thought the move was designed to extenuate the opposition 's funding			0
some believed the delay was a call to arms for all @entity0 to be active players in the democratic process			2
others had nothing but tears			0
whilst many fear the worst			0
