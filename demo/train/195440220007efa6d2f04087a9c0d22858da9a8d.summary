-- the @entity2 ' acknowledgment in its thursday editions that @entity5 hackers carried out sustained attacks on its computer systems should be a wake - up call to any company around the world that trades in information , according to computer security experts			1
" when you 're dealing with an adversary with significant resources like the @entity5 -- or the @entity20 , for that matter -- you need to take some pretty extreme steps , " said @entity13 , principal technologist for the @entity15 's @entity14 and @entity16			1
" off - the - shelf antivirus software is not going to be enough			1
" that 's because consumer antivirus software from business - supply stores such as @entity28 will not protect computer owners from state - sponsored actors , he said			2
" @entity28 , hopefully , will protect you from a scammer trying to steal your bank account , or a @entity34 criminal gang trying to put a key logger on your computer			2
there is no commercial software that is going to keep you safe from a determined government , " @entity13 said			2
according to @entity42 , the cyberassaults took place over four months , beginning during an investigation by the newspaper into the wealth reportedly accumulated by relatives of the @entity5 premier , @entity48			2
the @entity49 reported on thursday that its computer systems also had been infiltrated by @entity5 hackers			2
the hackers were monitoring the newspaper 's @entity5 coverage , according to a written statement from @entity55 , chief communications officer for parent company @entity56 " evidence shows that infiltration efforts target the monitoring of the @entity49 's coverage of @entity5 , and are not an attempt to gain commercial advantage or to misappropriate customer information , " it read			2
" if you 're a newspaper focusing on issues that are going to upset governments , then you need to invest in security as well , " @entity13 said			1
@entity5 authorities responded to the @entity2 ' reports on @entity48 's family members by blocking access to the @entity2 ' website in mainland @entity5			2
the @entity2 said that it had worked with computer security experts to monitor , study and then eject the attackers			1
it said that by following their movements , it aimed to " erect better defenses to block them " in the future			2
experts : @entity5 cyberattacks on @entity82 widespread such efforts are becoming more important as the incidence of hacking appears to grow , @entity13 said			1
" the first thing you do is make sure that everything you have is encrypted both in storage or transmission , " he said			2
that way , if a reporter leaves a laptop in a hotel room in @entity95 and the police try to copy it while the reporter is out of the room , it is protected , he said			2
but such efforts are not cheap			2
" you have to hire a bunch of internal security people , " he said			1
" but if you 're the newspaper of record and you 're talking to whistle - blowers who would go to jail or be tortured or arrested if they talked to you , then you need to take adequate steps			1
" the same message applies to any journalist who talks to sensitive sources , particularly in government , in the intelligence or defense communities , he said			2
" those journalists need to take real steps , take significant steps to shield the identities of their sources			1
" @entity13 said that , in his experience , few reporters appear to meet that standard			0
" most journalists do n't know much about digital security , " he said			1
" the number of journalists that i communicate with using encrypted e-mails i can probably count on one hand			1
the number of journalists who would even know how to open an encrypted e-mail is not something to feel confident about			1
" stories about @entity5 are not the only ones that reporters should be cautious about , said @entity136 , a partner in the @entity138 law firm @entity139 and a former prosecutor with the computer crime and intellectual property section of the @entity143			0
" certainly , if i 'm writing a story that implicates somebody who is sophisticated in computer hacking , i would be concerned , " said @entity136 , whose expertise includes the area of economic espionage			0
his feeling is that the incidence of such attacks is growing , but he acknowledged that it 's impossible to quantify			0
" you only really find out about it when people are caught , and a lot of organizations do n't necessarily report the hacks or the successful intrusions because they do n't want to be embarrassed			0
" @entity136 added , " i think just the mere fact that the @entity2 admits they were the victim of hacks is something new			0
" law firms are also frequent targets because they tend to take fewer security precautions than do the companies they represent , " and law firms are in possession of some important information , " he said			1
in response , he said , the @entity174 met last year with security experts at some of @entity179 's largest firms to help them beef up security			1
the threat extends to any organization in which information that is worth money is stored on computers -- " which is just about every organization and every business , " he said			0
prosecutions for hacking are rare and almost impossible to win when an attack is launched from outside the @entity20 , a fact that the hackers exploit , he said			0
" it 's just as easy to hack into an @entity20 computer from @entity5 as it is from @entity138 , given that there are no boundaries in cyberspace			0
" one reason companies can get into trouble is because employees are often easy to victimize , said @entity201 , an internet security analyst and founder and ceo of @entity205 , which advises companies on internet security			1
" your security is as good as your weakest link in the company , " said @entity201 , who is a former chief security officer of @entity208 all that 's necessary to introduce malware into a company 's computer system is for an employee to " click on something that sounds exciting , " he said			1
from a security perspective , companies tend to be good at blocking access to their computers through the main entryway , but they tend to do less well blocking other entries , @entity201 said			1
" take a house -- you bolt the front door ; somebody breaks in the back door ; then they can go into every room of your house			0
companies have to think about closing all the doors around the house and also put a bolt on every door in the house			0
" finding vulnerabilities is not hard for experts , he said			0
" every single client we 've had , we have successfully broken into their network to identify vulnerabilities , and helped them fix them			0
" news organizations tend to be among those with laxer security , he said			1
" from a philosophical approach , it actually makes sense that they would find themselves open to an attack like this , " he said , since news organizations , by their very nature , tend to be focused on open access to information			1
countries have been using cyber methods to attack each other for at least 15 years , but that fact has only recently gained widespread attention , he said			0
" people often say the @entity269 has ended ; the reality is the @entity269 has gone digital			1
" but the @entity269 of the last century rarely affected normal citizens or companies , and that is no longer the case , he said			1
" because of the way the world is now connected through the @entity278 , a regular company can find itself in the middle of @entity269 activity , which tells us that every company out there ought to think of security as one of their no.1 activities			1
otherwise , they risk becoming a pawn between two governments having a silent battle against each other			0
" the @entity20 has its own powerful counterintelligence machine , and that should surprise no one , he said			0
" if you have a country that knows how to use the power of the @entity278 and knows how to take advantage of counterintelligence activity through methods like hacking , they will certainly engage in it ; otherwise , they will be left behind and they well become sitting ducks			0
" asked about the @entity2 ' allegations on thursday , a spokesman for the @entity309 said that " all such alleged attacks are groundless , irresponsible accusations lacking solid proof or reliable research results			0
" " what else would you say ? " asked @entity201 rhetorically			0
" of course , you have to say that			0
if the @entity20 government were accused of something similar , the public relations machine would also say the exact same things			0
" @entity5 has been the victim of cyberattacks and " has laws and regulations prohibiting such actions , " the spokesman , @entity324 , said at a regular news briefing			1
a separate statement from the @entity330 said the country 's military " has never supported any hacker activities			0
" on thursday , it appeared that television censors in @entity5 were blacking out @entity0 's reporting of the hacking story			0
@entity5 authorities have blacked out the broadcast signal for international television stations such as @entity0 and the @entity341 when they have aired sensitive reports about the country .			0

" you need to take some pretty extreme steps , " @entity15 expert says
journalists tend to not be savvy about digital security , he says
