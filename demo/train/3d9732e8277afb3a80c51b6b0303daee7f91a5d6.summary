-- the nation 's most visible budget battle was heavy on passion and light on legislative attendance thursday as @entity6 wrangled over a bill that would strip teachers and other public employees of most of their collective bargaining rights and cut their benefits			1
@entity12 gov. @entity12 called for 16 senators -- 14 of them @entity14 -- to appear at the @entity15 in @entity6 for a vote on his bill			1
senate majority leader @entity18 said the chamber will reconvene friday			0
senate minority leader @entity20 said he and fellow @entity14 had left @entity21 because they were " trying to allow opportunity for democracy to work			1
" " we will return and do our job , but the governor has to do his job , " @entity20 said			2
he noted their return is contingent on changes to the controversial legislation			0
@entity12 called on the absent lawmakers to return to @entity21 " out of respect for the institution of the @entity36 and the democratic process			1
" " their actions by leaving the state and hiding from voting are disrespectful to the hundreds of thousands of public employees who showed up to work today and the millions of taxpayers they represent , " @entity12 said			1
@entity0 affiliates @entity47 and @entity49 reported that several of the @entity51 lawmakers fled to @entity52 , @entity53			0
and while the legislators skipped town , thousands of people came to @entity21 to protest the bill for a third day , including many teachers , who stand to be strongly affected by the bill			1
demonstrators spilled into the state 's @entity15 building , chanting , " this is our house " and " forward not backward , " voicing their opposition to the bill			1
the @entity68 canceled classes for the third day friday , because of anticipated staff absences			1
showdowns over local and state budgets -- hurt by lower tax revenues and other trends of the economic downturn , including federal budget cuts -- are occurring from @entity77 to @entity78			1
" there are some tough decisions that are going to have to made on the revenue side and the spending side , " said @entity79 , senior fellow at the @entity81 - based @entity80			2
-- a month after @entity53 lawmakers approved a massive tax hike , gov. @entity88 on wednesday unveiled a $ 35.4 billion budget that depends on state lawmakers approving $ 8.7 billion in new borrowing largely to clear a towering stack of unpaid bills			1
-- in @entity78 , mayor @entity94 presented budget plans thursday that could eliminate more than 6,000 teaching jobs in the next fiscal year			2
-- last month , the mayor of crime - ridden @entity99 , @entity100 , announced layoffs of nearly half of the city 's police force and close to a third of its fire department			1
-- in @entity77 , gov. @entity107 imposed a statewide hiring freeze across all government agencies			0
thirty - five @entity111 states and @entity112 reported projected budget shortfalls for fiscal year 2012 totaling $ 82.1 billion , according to the @entity114			2
" as most federal stimulus dollars will have been exhausted , a common phrase we hear from states across the country is that ' we 're very much on our own this year , ' " said @entity115 , a budget analyst for the conference			0
state revenues are -- at the national average -- 11 % below pre-recession levels largely because of high unemployment and other effects of the economic downturn , @entity79 said			0
" people are out of work and not buying as much , " @entity79 noted			0
with fewer budget contributions that , in part , stem from the higher unemployment numbers , public - sector services and long - standing contractual obligations could suffer , she explained			2
the budget battle is somewhat unique in heavily unionized @entity6 , where collective bargaining began			1
many workers do n't take kindly to what they see as a frontal assault on workers ' rights			0
@entity12 , who says the state is in a crisis , is asking legislators to pass his @entity146 to combat a $ 137 million shortfall through june 30			1
an upcoming two - year budget for 2011 - 13 must address a pending $ 3.6 billion deficit , he said			2
but the state 's @entity149 -- similar to the federal government 's @entity151 -- reported last month that tax cuts passed late last year by @entity6 's newly elected , @entity155 - led legislature had helped add more than $ 200 million to the state 's budget shortfall			1
the legislation requires workers to cover more of their health care premiums and pension contributions , although supporters say local governments will decide on health care contribution for their employees			0
pay raises would be limited to inflation , unless a referendum approves of a larger increases , and collective bargaining could cover only wages			0
the legislation also requires collective bargaining units to conduct annual votes to maintain certification , a costly procedure , and eliminates the right of unions to have dues deducted from worker paychecks			0
" calling this a budget bill is a smokescreen , " said @entity180 , president of @entity6 , which represents about 17,000 employees			1
" this is an attack on all labor organizations			0
" @entity188 press secretary @entity187 said president @entity189 described the bill as " more like an assault on unions " and their capacity for collective bargaining			0
" he does n't see that as a good thing , " @entity187 said			0
" the president believes , the secretary of education believes that the best way to deal with this is for people to address these problems by sitting down at the table to collaborate and work out a solution			0
" but @entity188 republicans -- many of whom were elected on budget - cutting campaigns -- have commonly taken a stricter stance on government spending and collective bargaining			2
" republicans in @entity215 -- and reform - minded @entity155 governors like @entity12 , @entity217 and @entity218 -- are daring to speak the truth about the dire fiscal challenges @entity111 face at all levels of government , " house speaker @entity212 said in a written statement			1
a spokeswoman for the @entity224 said the issue " goes far beyond what 's being discussed as a budget			2
" " it affects the very people who work on the front lines who will no longer have a voice in workplace , " said union spokeswoman @entity228			0
the legislation would save the state about $ 30 million between now and the end of june and , if continued , an estimated $ 300 million during the next two years , @entity12 has said			1
he said workers in the private sector pay higher percentages of their pay for health care and pensions			0
. @entity0 's @entity244 and @entity245 contributed to this report .			0
