-- the major portion of the area @entity3 is attempting to control for the @entity4 in @entity5 and @entity6 is the same place i called home for 16 months of my life			1
commanding @entity11 during the " surge " in 2007 - 08 -- a command that required securing four of the five provinces @entity15 now desires to occupy -- allowed me to study the geographic , cultural , infrastructure and political and economic complexities of northern @entity5			1
anyone who supports fighting @entity19 's @entity15 in this area ought to be aware of the challenges the land and the people will present			1
during our time there , we countered @entity28 insurgents , elements of @entity30 in @entity5 , homegrown terrorist groups like the 1920s @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and a variety of other gang - like organizations			1
during that time , i had more than 30,000 @entity39 forces and a significant @entity39 @entity41 support element contributing to our operations			1
we also coordinated with an emerging @entity28 army ( five divisions , 60,000 men in our area ) , @entity28 police force ( about 40,000 men and a few hundred women in the various cities in the region ) and a small and uncommitted @entity28 air force , with pilots training in helicopters and prop planes			1
the most important thing i learned is how tough it is to fight a determined enemy there			0
another takeaway : to succeed , the government of @entity5 must want to provide security in the area more than the @entity39 does			1
the four @entity64 provinces in the area between @entity66 and the borders with @entity68 and @entity6 are about the size of our states of @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			0
@entity76 -- with @entity77 as the capital city -- shares a 175 - mile border with @entity6 ; @entity76 and two other provinces have a 400 - mile border with the three @entity83 provinces ( also a part of @entity5 but viewed by most within their borders as the autonomous @entity87 )			1
the @entity83 provinces , in turn , share a 200 - mile border with @entity68 and a 300 - mile border with @entity92			2
four major rivers ( @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 ) and two major mountain ranges ( the now - famous @entity99 and the lesser - known but more mountainous @entity100 ) break the landscape , which is mostly desert , palm groves and irrigation canals			0
there are 10 major cities ( five of which are among @entity5 's top nine in population ) , dozens of smaller towns and hundreds of mud - hut villages			2
more than 11 million people make northern @entity5 their home ; i would suggest that over 90 % do not want @entity15 in control			1
the land is diverse , and the culture is exceedingly complex			0
though i studied this area for months prior to the deployment and then lived , traveled and interacted with the people in the area for over a year and a half , i still had difficulties understanding many cultural dynamics -- even with the advantage of @entity132 professionals , intelligence analysts from top three - letter agencies and cultural subject matter experts from universities and think tanks at my disposal			0
it will take more than just wanting to beat @entity15 to win in this area			2
tribes are critical in @entity5 , and in the north , there are seven major tribal confederations and over 100 subtribes			2
while many believe the north is @entity144 territory , i found that while many tribes were indeed @entity144 , a slightly smaller number were @entity144 - @entity148 mix , and some were exclusively @entity148			0
one tribal confederation -- the @entity150 -- is on both sides of the @entity5 / @entity6 border , they have subtribes that are @entity144 and @entity148 , and their members roam freely across this national boundary with more allegiance to tribal law than to government of @entity5 authority			0
when we were in northern @entity5 , we had evidence that some members of a tribe were assisting in smuggling weapons and foreign fighters from @entity6 into our area of operations			0
i would suspect they have provided the same service for @entity15			0
when growing and training the @entity28 army and police during our tour , we realized it was n't enough to recruit individual soldiers or police for the force			2
we had to garner tribal support			0
it becomes obvious why the @entity28 security forces fell in the wake of @entity15 advances : since the central government in @entity66 did not meet the wishes of the tribal sheiks in the north , the leaders ' calculation was that it was better to back those who would overthrow the government			1
all this gives some indication of the challenges new prime minister @entity193 has in winning back the north from the grips of @entity15			2
gaining tribal allegiance to support a government counteroffensive against @entity15 is an issue @entity193 understands ; it took @entity39 forces years to comprehend this critical cultural nuance			1
tribal feuds occur due to clashes over resources in rural areas , control of economic sectors in cities , honor issues ( promises of marriage ) and crimes committed by members of one tribe against another			0
the @entity83 region is not immune from tribal loyalties : the @entity218 make up one major political party ( the @entity220 ) ; the @entity221 make up the other ( the @entity222 )			2
there has been much discussion of the importance of the control of @entity227			0
but that is only one of many key infrastructure elements			0
the @entity239 oil refinery , the @entity241 oil fields , the @entity242 , the @entity231 of @entity232 at @entity233 and @entity234 , and key religious shrines like the newly renovated @entity148 mosque in @entity237 are also critical to the political and economic future of @entity5			0
each is probably on @entity15 's " control " list , just as the elimination of security forces and other religions is on the " destroy " list of this horrific organization			1
controlling or destroying each will result in humanitarian disasters as @entity15 broadens its reach			0
a more inclusive @entity28 government is currently forming , and hopefully it will gain momentum in addressing a nationalistic approach to countering @entity15			1
it will require many things : an @entity28 national will ; a condemnation by sheiks and imams -- and other moderates in the @entity267 religion -- of the horrors committed by @entity15 ; an @entity28 and @entity83 military adequately supplied and trained , centrally controlled and supported by the people and not used for sectarian purposes ; help from its friends and allies in the region and beyond ; and taking advantage of mistakes @entity15 is increasingly making in its messaging campaign			1
special operators designating key targets and @entity39 air power dropping bombs will contribute , but ultimately only the @entity28 , including the @entity83 , can turn this around			1
join us on @entity284 / @entity283 .			0

*retired* *lt.* gen. @entity286 spent 16 months in @entity5
he says he learned about the great *social* , geographic challenges of the region
@entity39 *airstrikes* , @entity293 may help but wo n't gain *victory* over @entity15
@entity296 : only the @entity28 , @entity83 security forces have the *potential* to oust @entity15
