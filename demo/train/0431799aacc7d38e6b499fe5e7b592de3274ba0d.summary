-- military work is physically demanding — and we 're not just talking about soldiers on the battlefield			0
travel down the chain , and you 'll find plenty of positions where strength and stamina are highly valued skills			0
take the @entity13 for example			1
the @entity13 needs ships and those ships need to be built and maintained — a rough , physically draining job			1
sandblasting , riveting , and grinding excess metal off the ships can take a toll on the human body			1
you 're often carrying tools that can weigh upwards of 30 pounds			2
" there 's a lot of wear and tear on you , " says @entity24 , director of new initiatives for @entity26			1
" skilled workers can maybe do that for three to four minutes then they need to put the tool down and they need to rest			0
" photos of unexpected shooting targets used by the world 's armies for the past couple of years , @entity24 has been leading a team of engineers and designers to create one of the first industrial - use exoskeletons			0
called the @entity45 , the exoskeleton is able to support tools of up to 36 pounds and transfer that load from a worker 's hands and arms to the ground			1
the goal is to lighten workers ' loads , ultimately making them more productive and skilled at their jobs			0
the @entity13 recently bought two of the exoskeletons and plans to test them over the next six months to see how they might be used in an industrial situation			1
compared to something like the @entity61 ) , a computerized exoskeleton that essentially wants to turn mere mortals into @entity64 , the @entity45 is fairly simple			1
" i would call it elegant , " says @entity24			0
the anodized aluminum and carbon fiber skeleton weighs 30 pounds , and follows along the outside of a human 's body			2
it has joints in the parts of the body that would regularly have joints ( ankle , knee , hip ) and flexes from side to side at the waist			2
@entity24 says the skeleton was designed for complex environments — whoever is wearing it can climb stairs or a ladder , squat and generally move business as usual in the exoskeleton			2
tools mount to the front of the @entity45 and that weight is directed through the joints in the hip and down to the floor , relieving stress on the entire body , including the feet and ankles			1
people around the world pose with everything they eat in a day watch and learn the design team began by watching how humans walk			2
" you have to look at biomechanics of the person because it 's not just a stand ; it 's really something they can move around in , " says @entity24			0
the @entity45 was designed so it could slip over a worker 's boot — this is important since feet often communicate the first signs of weariness			1
it 's like running in a pair of crappy shoes ; it impacts your entire body			2
many exoskeletons transfer that weight to the sole of the foot , but this is a problem , says @entity24			0
" when the weight of the tools and exoskeleton itself is transferred to the ground , it comes to rest on the sole , " he says			1
" however , a sole can also contribute to user discomfort , increased metabolic cost to the user and introduces instability			0
" instead , the @entity45 uses a stirrup that attaches to the ankle , allowing the foot to rest on the ground as usual			1
why are we so fat ? the multimillion - dollar scientific quest to find out early tests show that the exoskeleton has increased productivity anywhere from two to 27 times , depending on the task			2
the team measured the amount of time a worker could hold a 16 - pound grinder overhead without having to rest his arms			0
" the longest operators could work continuously without a break was three minutes sustained without augmentation , " says @entity24			2
" using the @entity45 , operators could work 30 minutes or longer without requiring rest breaks			1
" @entity26 has been developing exoskeleton technology for the past five years			1
its other exoskeleton , the @entity158 , is hydraulic - powered and can support up to 200 pounds			0
the @entity158 was designed to be used on the field , during battle			0
the @entity45 ' capabilities are scaled down , but with its focus on mobility , you can imagine that it could be useful for other industries like construction or mining — " anywhere there 's a complex and irregular environment , " says @entity24			1
" we 're expecting other industries to see it and say , ' we want something similar			0
' " more from @entity0 : the mystery of go , the ancient game that computers still ca n't win i liked everything i saw on @entity178 for two days			0

new exoskeleton allows operators to lift heavy tools as if they were *weightless*
called @entity45 , it is developed by @entity26 and has *attracted* *interest* from the @entity13
it works by transferring the load down to the ground and is *unpowered*
an *ergonomic* design permits freedom of movement and *adapts* to different body types
