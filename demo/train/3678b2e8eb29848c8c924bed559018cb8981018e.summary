-- @entity1 scored a huge victory in the long - running and byzantine legal battle over the copyright to @entity5 yesterday , thanks to a ruling by 9th @entity8 that cements the studio 's control over the lucrative superhero character			1
the decision drew , in part , on precedent established in a lawsuit against @entity16 by the @entity18 twins and held that a 2001 agreement between the heirs of @entity5 co-creator @entity21 and @entity1 was indeed binding and that a district judge in a 2008 case had " erred " in granting the @entity21 heirs partial copyright			1
this decision follows a ruling last october that denied any part of the copyright to the heirs of @entity5 's other co-creator , @entity31			1
@entity31 and @entity21 famously sold their creation to @entity34 for a mere $ 130 in 1938 , long before the character went on to become a multi-billion dollar franchise for the studio , thanks to the success of numerous @entity41 blockbusters , television shows and other merchandise			0
the recent ruling on the fate of @entity5 hinged upon a 2001 agreement between the @entity21 heirs and @entity1 , which the @entity48 had claimed was not finalized and therefore not enforceable			2
in their decision on the case , the @entity49 repeatedly cited a lawsuit involving @entity16 as precedent , wherein the @entity18 brothers â € ” who sued the social media site for allegedly stealing their idea -- had similarly claimed that an earlier mediated agreement was non-binding			2
the court disagreed , and found that under @entity64 law , a " term sheet " agreement could be enforceable " even though everyone understood that certain material aspects of the deal would be papered later			0
" @entity68 , an attorney and law professor who previously served as a clerk in the @entity49 , told @entity71 that while " it 's entirely possible that the court would have reached the same outcome without the @entity16 ruling ... @entity16 made it practically inevitable			1
" @entity71 reached out for comment to @entity1 , who responded : " this is a great day for @entity5 , for his fans , for @entity34 and for @entity81 's ruling vindicates @entity34 ' long - held position that it entered into a binding agreement with the @entity21 family in @entity86 's decision paves the way for the @entity48 finally to receive the compensation they negotiated for and which @entity34 has been prepared to pay for over a decade			1
we are extremely pleased that @entity5 's adventures can continue to be enjoyed across all media platforms worldwide for generations to come			0
" the decision comes at a fortunate time for the studio , whose new @entity5 reboot " @entity99 " heads to theaters in june			0
before the latest ruling , @entity1 would have been unable to create new " derivative works " based on @entity5 's first appearance in @entity104 # 1 â € ” presumably including @entity5 films â € ” without accounting for the profits to the @entity107 as co-owners , complicating plans for a potential @entity99 sequel and the @entity112 movie slated for 2015			2
now , @entity1 will likely be able to proceed without further hindrance , ending a nearly 65 - year legal battle whose uglier moments included a letter from @entity21 's dying widow ( the original model for @entity120 ) accusing the @entity1 lawyers of harassment and a still - ongoing lawsuit by @entity1 accusing the @entity21 's lawyer @entity124 of misconduct			0
in 2011 , @entity21 's daughter @entity126 published a letter likening her family 's legal battle with @entity1 to a " @entity130 versus @entity132 struggle " and said that her father had " co-created @entity5 as the ' champion of the oppressed ... sworn to devote his existence to helping those in need ! ' but sadly his dying wish , for his family to regain his rightful share of @entity5 , has become a cautionary tale for writers and artists everywhere			1

a ruling on the copyright to @entity5 was decided in part by @entity16 ruling
appeals courts said @entity1 2001 deal with creator 's family is binding
that 's similar to how court ruled in @entity16 's battle with @entity18 twins
attorney says @entity5 ruling was " inevitable " because of @entity16
