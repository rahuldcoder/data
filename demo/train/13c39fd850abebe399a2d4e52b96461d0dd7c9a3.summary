@entity0 , @entity1 -- an underemployed @entity1 matador is breaking tradition and carrying advertising on his capes in the bullring -- promoting a soft drink aimed at gays			1
@entity10 in an exhibition fight on sept. 23 in the southern @entity1 city of @entity13			1
while fighting bulls , matador @entity10 will use capes embroidered with the words " @entity17 , " the name of the energy drink			1
the move has many in the macho - steeped world of bullfighting seeing red			0
but @entity10 , 29 , told @entity2 , " i 'm glad to be the first person ( in bullfighting ) whom the gay community will take as an icon			2
" " people think the bullfighter is very tough , very rude and they only like women , " @entity10 added			2
" but we are in 2009			0
" industry experts said it would be the first time advertising will appear on bullfighter 's capes -- the large one used when the bull rushes into the ring , and a smaller one used later as the matador moves in for the kill			1
in the 1980s , matador @entity42 had a contract showing the brand name of @entity47 electronics giant @entity45 on parts of his shiny " suit of lights , " while fighting			0
" but that lasted just one or two fights , " recalls @entity51 , a former bullfighter who now manages one of @entity1 's top - tier matadors , @entity52			1
@entity52 has declined offers to carry publicity on his bullfighter 's suit and capes while in the ring , @entity51 said , out of respect for " the ritual of bullfighting			1
" " the cape is a sacred thing , " said @entity51 , adding that it 's fine for premier bullfighters -- who are treated like rock stars -- to have lucrative endorsement deals for products , but only outside of the ring			0
this is the first endorsement deal of any kind for @entity10			0
he became a full matador in 2006 , facing the biggest bulls , but said he 's fought only six or seven fights since then			0
yet a bullfighter in demand can have dozens of fights in just a single season			0
" @entity10 is a new bullfighter and he might see this as a way to get known , " @entity51 said			2
if so , it appears to be working			0
@entity10 and his drinks company have been flooded with media queries since they made the announcement this week			0
@entity92 , the ceo at @entity93 , the firm that makes gay up and took over management of @entity10 's career just two weeks ago , said they plan to organize an exhibition fight for @entity10 soon , and sell the tv rights exclusively			1
gay up is a non-alcoholic energy drink made in @entity1 , drawn from a formula originally from @entity101			1
@entity92 said the company tried to sponsor a @entity1 football ( soccer ) team but was turned down because of the gay up brand			2
then they found @entity10 , who says he 's not gay			1
he 's been gored six or seven times in his career , which started 13 years ago as a junior bullfighter			1
" all sports teams have advertising on their uniforms , " @entity10 said , insisting he 'd continue to fight bulls the same way , even with ads on his capes			2
bull breeder @entity118 welcomed the change , saying it might help revive @entity1 's billion - dollar bullfighting industry , which he said in recent years has seen a 45 percent decline in the number of fights , especially in smaller village bullrings			2
" only @entity128 is sacred , " said @entity126 , who also publishes a bullfighting web site			0
" the rest of the traditions have to advance , modernize			0
