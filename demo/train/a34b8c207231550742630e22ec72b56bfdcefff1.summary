@entity1 during an exhibition in @entity1 , @entity0 proudly poses with her top prize winning creation -- a bright green clutch stitched together using an old nylon rice bag and a bottle top			1
the 31 - year - old @entity0 happily shows off her winning display , telling visitors how much fun she had making the bag with her partner , a local design college student			2
" the hardest part was sewing the bottle cap on , " she said			2
" i researched different types of bags			2
sometimes you need a bigger bag if you want to put more things inside			2
" walk around the room and the exhibition is full of discarded items -- wine boxes , cd covers and straws -- now reborn as pen holders , notepads and lamps			0
in a sense , @entity0 and the 15 or so people involved with the project have been " neglected " in one way or another by @entity1 society , all of these people have struggled to get by because they all have intellectual disabilities			1
despite the pride she has for her daughter , @entity0 's mother worries about her			0
" her character is too simple and warm			0
i 'm worried she will get hurt and sometimes she has to be careful about what she says			0
" people living with @entity50 are often stuck with menial jobs			1
but this exhibition -- run by the local @entity53 -- gave @entity0 and others the chance to learn a new skill , partner with a local student to reinvent " trash " into treasure -- all in an effort to raise disability awareness			1
in @entity66 superstition , people with disabilities have been associated with bad luck -- that the disability was a punishment for the wrongdoings of an ancestor			1
many lived in hiding , encountering discrimination and slurs , advocates say			1
but increasingly , people are finding ways to counter misconceptions and bring people with disabilities into the mainstream			1
it 's an experience that @entity82 , a social work professor at the @entity83 and mother of a daughter with @entity50 , knows well			0
@entity82 explains that traditionally disabled people are seen as " an outcast , something [ that is ] no good			1
" " there is a @entity66 saying that it must be the family who is doing something wrong ... in the older days they were saying that it 's a kind of punishment			0
" @entity82 recalled that when she and other parents of children opened their first center for the @entity99 more than 20 years ago , the windows were broken and they could n't use the elevator because neighbors did n't want them there			0
the group responded by holding workshops with residents to explain and dispel myths about @entity50			0
a few years later , the group was finally allowed to use the elevator and the workshops no longer became necessary			0
although information about disability is now widely available , some of that stigma exists today			0
@entity115 is a 15 year - old with cerebral palsy who requires round - the - clock care			0
she ca n't move but she can see and hear			0
she often has to deal with strangers talking about her in front of her			0
her mother @entity123 , originally from @entity124 , said : " the difficult thing with @entity115 is that if she is in company and people are talking about her , she 's understanding everything they 're saying			1
" to combat this problem , she made a sign in @entity132 and @entity66 telling people she can see and hear			1
for @entity136 , the key to change in attitudes is integration			0
" that 's maybe what we 're still not doing enough of in @entity1 , maybe in schools and getting people like @entity115 ... out and about in society , because until they 're in society , society is not going to fully understand or appreciate them			1
" the @entity147 estimates that about 10 % of the city 's population has physical or intellectual disabilities , based on on figures from 2014			1
at another photo exhibition featuring people with disabilities , @entity0 , a 19 - year - old with @entity50 , strikes a @entity156 pose in his green belt			1
his father , @entity158 said he believes attitudes are changing			0
" more and more people with disabled child or children , [ the parents ] will take them outside to encounter the whole world , let them learn , let them go to school and not just hide the disabled child or children in @entity1			1
nowadays , more and more parents love or like to do that			0
" @entity171 photographed @entity0 and other young people with @entity50 as models for his exhibition entitled " the @entity175			1
" he photographed young people showing off their hobbies such as acting , dancing and swimming			1
there have been efforts around the globe to be more inclusive of people with @entity50 , including @entity185 ads in the @entity186 featuring child models and a tv ad by @entity124 department store , @entity189 's			2
two years ago , @entity171 started volunteering with the @entity99 and realized part of the problem was that people did n't know how to talk to those with the condition and that they were often treated as patients , instead of people			2
he said that the aim of the exhibition was to show a more playful side of people with @entity50			2
" they just want to love and be involved in making people happy , " he said .			2
