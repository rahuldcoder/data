@entity0 -- the leak of highly radioactive water into the @entity5 from the crippled @entity7 nuclear plant has stopped , @entity2 said early wednesday			1
the leak had stopped as of 5:38 a.m. wednesday ( 4:38 p.m. et ) , said the company , which runs the plant			1
earlier , @entity2 officials had said an attempt to plug the leak had shown a " significant difference , " despite the material not setting as hoped			2
the company had injected a silica - based polymer dubbed " liquid glass " to reduce the leak			2
the utility 's assessment comes after the country 's @entity22 said the substance had not hardened as expected			0
the material had been pumped from below into the leaking shaft at the plant 's no. 2 reactor			1
the news was a bright spot amid a series of setbacks @entity34 authorities faced tuesday , including the detection of radiation in a fish and news that the water gushing into the @entity5 had radiation levels millions of times above the regulatory limit			1
readings from samples taken saturday in the concrete pit outside the turbine building of the no. 2 reactor -- one of six at the crisis - plagued plant -- had radiation 7.5 million times the legal limit , a @entity2 official said			1
newer findings , from tuesday afternoon , showed a sizable drop to 5 million times the norm			1
town near nuclear plant rejects @entity34 utility 's ' token ' offer the utility company also noted tuesday that the radiation levels diminished sharply a few dozen meters from the leak , consistent with their assessment that the spill might have a minimal effect on sea life			1
but even in these spots , radiation levels remained several hundred thousand times the legal limit			1
both the utility and @entity34 's nuclear safety agency said they did n't know how much water is leaking into the sea from reactor no. 2			1
but engineers have had to pour nearly 200 tons of water a day into the no. 2 reactor vessel to keep it cool , and regulators say they believe that is the water leaking out			1
@entity34 chief cabinet secretary @entity84 said the presence of radioactive iodine " in one sample of fresh fish " prompted authorities to regulate the radiation in seafood for the first time			2
while fishing has been forbidden within 20 kilometers ( 12 miles ) of @entity7 , there had been no restrictions on seafood , as there were for some vegetables and milk from certain locales			0
now , the same radiation standards that apply to vegetables will apply to ocean products as well			0
nuclear crisis explainer " the " provisional ingestion limit , equivalent to vegetables and applied to fish and shellfish , will take effect immediately , " the cabinet minister said			0
meanwhile , the deliberate dumping of radioactive water into the sea continues , @entity2 said wednesday			1
on tuesday , @entity84 apologized for the decision to dump the water -- all part of the effort to curb the flow of the more toxic liquid spotted days ago rushing from outside the no. 2 unit			0
@entity2 said that as of tuesday evening , more than 5,740 tons had been released -- about half the total volume			2
the process of expelling contaminated water in the plant 's water treatment facility and around several of its reactors began monday and will take five days , a @entity2 official said			2
" the water contains a high level of radiation , " @entity84 said of the liquid being dumped into the @entity5			1
" we are sorry for this decision we have to make			0
" special coverage : @entity34 earthquake aftermath the most contaminated batch of this water comes from outside the no. 6 reactor , likely having gotten in via groundwater ( and not a breach in the unit itself ) , officials said			0
it has a concentration of iodine - 131 that would be 100 times more than the maximum amount in tap water that infants could drink , and 10 times more than what would be ok in food			2
overall , the dump equates to about 3 million gallons , noted @entity152 was , a nuclear engineering professor from the @entity154			0
yet @entity155 , a @entity22 official , said , " we 've decided that discharging the contaminated water into the sea poses no major health hazard			2
" experts say this is a fair assessment , given the likelihood the contamination should quickly dilute , especially if the tainted material is largely @entity145 , which loses half its radiation every eight days			0
" to put this in perspective , the @entity5 holds about 300 trillion swimming pools full of water , and they are going to release about five swimming pools full , " said @entity166 , chair of the radiation safety committee at @entity168			1
" so hopefully the churning of the ocean and the currents will quickly disperse this so that it gets to very dilute concentrations relatively quickly			0
" @entity179 , president of the @entity181 - based @entity180 , said he does not expect to see any permanent effects on marine life , even close to the plant			0
however , he added that officials should monitor radiation levels closely -- in the ocean as well as in seafood that reaches restaurants and markets			1
@entity190 scales back military aid units in @entity34 a piece of good news , according to @entity34 government reports , is that airborne radiation appears to be steadily falling around northeast @entity34			0
two measurements from 15 kilometers ( nine miles ) or less from the plant showed amounts of radioactive iodine - 131 at 2 to 3.7 times the legal standard , with levels of a far longer - lasting cesium isotope well below the official limit			1
also , utility and government officials have described conditions recently in the @entity7 plant 's reactors and spent nuclear fuel pools as generally stable			0
there have been exceptions -- like the new need to pump 3 - meter - deep water from a drain outside the @entity215 5 and 6 units for fear it could rise , enter nearby turbine buildings and short out power for the units ' nuclear fuel cooling systems			0
but such problems are n't occurring at the same pace , or with the same apparent severity , as was evident weeks ago			0
the top priority , however , is stopping the water that 's been gushing directly into the @entity5 through a cracked concrete shaft outside the no. 2 reactor			1
how to help in @entity34 relief efforts @entity84 said monday that the decision to dump tainted water from other reactors and the wastewater treatment facility was unavoidable in order to ensure the safety of the no. 2 reactor core			0
the idea is to expeditiously pump the tainted water from around the no. 2 reactor 's turbine building , lowering levels inside so that water no longer rushes out into the sea , a @entity34 nuclear safety official said			1
this came after the first two failed attempts to plug the problematic crack -- one by pouring in concrete , the other using a chemical compound mixed with sawdust and newspaper			0
reactors no. 1 and no. 3 , which have lower levels of water , need to be drained as well			2
@entity2 's plan is to pump that water to other storage tanks , including some that still need to be set up			2
water in and around the @entity215 5 and 6 reactors is being jettisoned directly in the sea , officials said			2
interactive map on @entity34 crisis another big problem may be that authorities still do n't know how exactly the gushing water got contaminated , where it came from or how to fix potential leaks and cracks deep inside the reactor complex and nuclear fuel			0
@entity273 , a former senior @entity190 nuclear engineer , said late monday that authorities will continue to have problems related to excess , radioactive water -- and the need to dump some of it -- as long as they inject huge amounts in to prevent fuel rods from overheating in reactors ' cores and spent fuel pools			1
" this is not a one - off deal , " @entity273 said of dumping radioactive water into the ocean			1
" this issue of water and water management is going to plague them until they can get ( fully operating ) long - term core cooling			0
" @entity1 's @entity295 , @entity296 and @entity297 and journalist @entity298 contributed to this report			0

new : the leak of radioactive water into the @entity5 has been stopped
more than 5,700 tons of less radioactive water have been *purposefully* released so far
radiation levels drop sharply *offshore* , but are many times over the legal limit
water in a pit that 's leaking into the sea had radiation 7.5 million times above the norm
