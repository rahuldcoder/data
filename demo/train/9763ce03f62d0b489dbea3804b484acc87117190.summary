-- a deadly bacterial outbreak that has killed at least 23 people in @entity5 is limited to an area around the @entity8 city of @entity9 and does not require @entity5 - wide controls , a top @entity2 official said tuesday			1
" there is no reason as of today to take ... measures at ( the ) @entity5 level , " @entity16 commissioner @entity15 said , adding , " we consider any ban on any product as disproportionate			1
" a new death in @entity8 due to the e. coli outbreak was announced tuesday , bringing the total there to 22			0
the other death , in @entity23 , was of a person who had visited @entity8			0
top @entity5 farming officials met tuesday in @entity27 , where @entity2 agriculture commissioner @entity28 proposed a 150 million euro ( $ 220 million ) compensation plan for farmers affected by the panic			1
but he said that offer may have to be increased in the face of complaints that it 's not enough			0
farmers are demanding compensation for losses due to being wrongly blamed for causing the outbreak			1
@entity39 alone seeks about $ 600 million in lost farm exports of cucumbers , tomatoes and other produce from the past few weeks , and farmers in @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and even @entity8 say they have millions of dollars in losses , too			1
@entity28 said the @entity49 may come back with an " improved offer " as early as wednesday , and hopes to have a decision within days			0
but he said paying 100 percent of claims -- as some countries demanded at the meeting -- would not be possible given the @entity2 budget restraints			1
" the commission is assuming its responsibility within the limits of our regulation and of our budget , " @entity28 said			0
the cause of the outbreak remains unclear , as new test results tuesday proved negative			1
there was no trace of @entity69 in a pack of bean sprouts in a household in @entity9 , where a man had become infected , health authorities there told @entity0			1
the sprouts came from the farm which officials believe could be the source of the outbreak			1
but initial tests showed no sign of @entity81 coli there , agriculture officials in the @entity8 state of @entity85 said monday			1
but authorities said that does not mean their suspicions are not correct ; they would not expect to find evidence of @entity69 if the tainted sprouts were no longer in the supply chain			1
test results are back for 20 of the 40 samples , @entity85 officials said monday			1
it was not clear when the rest of the test results would be available			1
on sunday , officials said @entity8 - grown sprouts are the likely source for the e. coli outbreak			1
" there is a direct link between this company and these people getting sick , " said @entity100 , the agricultural minister in @entity85			0
it was not clear how the rare strain may have gotten into the sprouts , officials said			0
@entity69 has not been found in the company , @entity108 , which has halted production and is recalling its products			2
@entity113 , in the town of @entity112 , said in a statement it was " shocked and worried			0
... that part of our production has been linked to e. coli infections " and had never had a problem in its 25 years of growing sprouts			0
it said it had found no evidence of @entity69 during routine testing in january or during tests last month in response to the health scare			2
but a leading @entity8 microbiologist said monday that sprouts were a " plausible " source of the infection			0
sprouts can harbor bacteria , which can spread during the growing process , said @entity135 of the @entity136			2
" either it was inside the seed , which i do not think is the case , or the bacteria was inside the water , " @entity135 said on @entity8 's @entity138 radio			2
he is not working directly on the case			0
sprouts are bred in drums that are heated to slightly warmer than body temperature -- ideal conditions for the growth not only of sprouts , but of bacteria , the agriculture ministry of @entity85 said			1
authorities say the sprouts may have become tainted so long ago that trace - back tests may never identify the company as the source			1
but several restaurants and cafeterias linked to the outbreak got sprouts from the company , officials said			0
and two workers at the agricultural company have come down with severe cases of diarrhea ; in at least one of those cases , @entity69 was the cause , @entity100 said			0
@entity112 is in the district of @entity170 in north - central @entity8			2
last week , @entity39 rejected suggestions that its cucumbers could have been the source after the @entity174 said @entity69 bacteria were found in organic cucumbers originating from @entity39 , packaged in @entity8 and distributed to various countries			2
authorities initially called for the cucumbers to be pulled from sale			2
but @entity8 later said @entity39 produce was not the source of the infection -- leading to the claims for compensation			2
@entity28 said that some farmers who belong to producer organizations might also find additional compensation there , and that some of those funds are also backed by the @entity49			1
the @entity49 will need to document how the compensation money is paid out , he said			2
a growers ' cooperative representative in southern @entity39 said earlier tuesday that farmers around the town of @entity197 , a major year - round producer of fresh produce under expansive greenhouses , are busy filling out claims forms already			2
the outbreak of the virulent strain of @entity69 has infected more than 2,400 people in at least 13 countries , @entity5 health authorities said monday			1
the vast majority are in @entity8 , where doctors have found 630 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome ( @entity211 ) -- a form of kidney failure -- in the current outbreak , according to the @entity215			0
that 's more cases of @entity211 than in any other recorded outbreak worldwide			0
fifteen patients in @entity8 have died of @entity211 , according to the center , while six died of @entity221 , a strain that can result in abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea and causes intestinal hemorrhaging			0
the center said 1,601 people have that e. coli strain but do not have @entity211			0
infections have also been identified in @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity46 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity39 , @entity236 and the @entity237 , according to the organization			0
@entity0 's @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243 contributed to this report .			0
