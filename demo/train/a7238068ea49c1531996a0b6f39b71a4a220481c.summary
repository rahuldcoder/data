-- @entity2 @entity1 is standing on the white rock patio , just to the right of the now - silent cannons of @entity7 's @entity6 , trying to get himself around a memory he never had			1
@entity1 , a 21 - year old @entity10 - @entity9 student at @entity11 , came to @entity6 to find his great ancestors , men and maybe women whose names he does n't , and likely , wo n't ever know			1
what he found here was so much better , and so much worse			2
" i just took a quick minute to look at the water crashing up against this castle , " he says			1
" it 's just overwhelming			1
" @entity1 stares out at the sea , as if trying to figure the route the slave ships carrying his ancestors sailed from the shores of @entity26 to @entity10 , to the " @entity27			1
" he is in @entity7 studying abroad at the @entity28 , trying , he tells me , " to get that @entity26 experience , that experience of being home and being connected and learning about where i came from and where my ancestors came from			1
" below his feet and all around him , he is finding diabolical answers			2
tortuous voyage our guide tells us that between the late 17th and early 19th centuries , some three million @entity26 slaves -- many traded to the @entity40 by @entity26 tribes -- were shipped out to the @entity43 from this ironically picturesque , fading white prison			1
four in 10 never survived the tortuous transoceanic voyage , crammed barely alive in the hull below the deck			1
here one learns , just surviving to get on board was a victory of the human spirit			2
our guide takes our small group from the sunny bright patio into the tunnel that leads to the men 's dungeons			1
in one dungeon , @entity1 studies the thick stone walls and looks toward the two tiny windows high up near the ceiling at the end of the room			1
he hears each word the guide says , grabs the words as they hang in the musty air : " they put about 1,000 men at a time in this room , no light			2
they had to go on the floor , and live in it			2
" there 's only a small channel running through the center of the room , their sewer			1
" see this patch on the floor here ? " our guide says			2
" this is what 's left of human excrement , 300 years - old			1
" this is what they lived in , died in			2
" the average stay was two to six months			2
@entity1 tells me , " 1,000 men			1
how did they lie down to sleep ? how could they bear the smell ? " the guide says : " some slept sitting , others in rows , their heads between the legs of their fellows			0
after a while , they had no senses anymore			0
" @entity1 sees a lot in the dungeon 's darkness			1
" i was just standing there in the dungeon room , " he says , " and i was thinking , how many songs were sung to get them through the night ? how many tears fell ? how many solemn prayers were enough ? " the ' lucky ones ' prayers indeed			0
the @entity40 built their church directly above the men 's dungeons			2
our guide says the slaves likely could hear the sunday prayers			2
in the women 's dungeons , much smaller , the guide tells us , some 400 female slaves were kept			1
" can anyone tell me why they had women slaves ? " he asks			2
@entity1 listens , the words hang , suspended across centuries			1
the guide : " breeding			0
slave buyers in the @entity43 wanted to make sure their slaves could produce more slaves , so they sent some women too			1
" a few women became the " lucky ones			0
" when the castle 's commander wanted companionship , the soldiers would march the women into the courtyard , and from a walkway above , the commander would pick one out			1
she was washed and brought to him			0
if she got pregnant , she was sent to a house in town and taken care of , and her mulatto child was sent to school and treated well			0
the words come slowly to @entity1			1
" so the " lucky ones , " he pauses , taking a breath of repulsed recognition			0
" those were the ones who were raped			0
they were the " lucky ones			0
" later , i realize this experience is so different for @entity1 than it is for most tourists , who are shocked by the barbarity but ultimately , one step removed			1
for them , it is history			0
but for @entity1 , it is personal			1
" i ca n't feel disconnected , " he explains			0
" these are the people you heard stories about , the people who came through your grandmother , your great grandfather , your great uncles -- these are the people who i came through			0
" condemned cell we cross the patio and walk into another room , small , tight , the walls made of thick stone , no windows			0
the guide closes the door and all light disappears			0
a few people quickly become uncomfortable			0
after a few seconds , he opens the door , and light pours back in			0
he explains this is the " @entity189 , " where they put slaves who resisted			2
he says they threw them in here , behind three locked doors , and just left them , with no food , no water , no ventilation			0
on the floor and lower walls , you can see scratch marks			0
@entity1 thinks of those slaves , their last scrawls of hope and life , vanishing in the darkness , as they brutally died			1
@entity1 says he feels helpless , angry			1
he wants to do something , anything , but time is the insurmountable obstacle			0
" i wonder what i could have done to help that person make it through the night , " he says , " to help him through that moment when he felt it was so necessary to scrape the ground			0
" and lastly , we walk toward the infamous door , the " @entity223			0
" this is the doorway where slaves were led , to be loaded on to ships , their last moments in their native land			2
as we walk toward the door down the corridor , the guide points off to the right , to a deep tunnel where the slaves were walked			2
he explains they never came to the surface , instead led through tunnels from the dungeons to the sea			0
@entity1 steps through the door and looks out			1
our guide explains , in those days , the water came right up to the door			0
now it has receded several dozen meters			2
but for @entity1 , the water , the reality , is still right at his feet			1
' so much anger ' i asked him what he would say to those who ran this place			0
he looks down , seems to shake slightly			0
" @entity255 , just so much anger			0
but i would have so many questions why			0
no religion , no amount of wealth , nothing can amount or perpetuate or give you that confidence or okay to think that it 's okay to do this to another human being			2
i would just want to know why			0
" i asked him what he would say to his ancestors , who survived this place and the journey by ship to live in the @entity43 as slaves , still strong enough there to make a family , to give him life centuries later			1
" i would say , hold on			0
what you 're going through is not going to last long			0
" @entity1 named @entity9 civil rights leaders dr. @entity278 and @entity279 , @entity281 independence leader @entity280 , and @entity7 's first president @entity282			1
" it 's up to us to carry on the legacy of those who came after our ancestors			1
" unfinished story for @entity1 , @entity6 , and other slave forts like it up and down what they used to call the " @entity294 , " is a story that is not finished			1
it is making him something better			0
" being here today is going to enable me to step into those lanes i was afraid to step into before , and just walk proud , to not be afraid to go after those things that i hope for and to stand for those rights i dream of			0
" he says he owes that to his ancestors who survived , and that it is a way of telling those who ran this place -- they did not win			1
act of liberation for @entity1 , what happened here centuries ago , is very much a part of the present			1
@entity1 is angry , yes , but this visit is also an act of liberation			1
in the early 2000s , the bones of two african slaves were repatriated from their @entity9 graves to @entity6			1
they were carried back from the beach through the @entity223			0
our guide says , on that day , the horrific spell was finally broken			0
a sign over the door as one walks back through now says simply , " @entity322			0
" @entity1 walks back through it too			1
" just make sure whatever you 're doing is for the right , for the just , and it 's always positive , " he says			2
he tells me he leaves with a new purpose : to walk back through the @entity322 , to carry his ancestors back through it , every day of his life			2
the @entity333 and the @entity334 sponsored @entity336 's reporting trip to @entity7 .			1

@entity338 @entity1 returned to @entity7 in search of his ancestors
he visited @entity6 , one of more than two dozen " slave castles " on the coast
four out of 10 @entity26 slaves shipped to the @entity43 never survived the journey
@entity1 's ancestors did . he says his presence at the castle shows the slavers did not win
