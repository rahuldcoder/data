-- @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 have lost the first round of their legal fight over " @entity7 , " their monster 2013 hit			1
the three artists have been in a lengthy standoff with the family of soul legend @entity13 , which has alleged that " @entity7 " illegally copies @entity16 's 1977 hit " @entity18 , " among other complaints			2
@entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 -- whose given name is @entity3 -- filed a pre-emptive lawsuit in august 2013 asking a federal judge in @entity22 to declare that " @entity7 " does n't infringe on the copyright of " @entity18			1
" the @entity16 estate followed with a countersuit that accused @entity1 of not only ripping off " @entity18 " but infringing on the copyright of @entity16 's " after the dance " and having a " @entity13 fixation			2
" @entity13 heirs sue ' @entity7 ' artists this tension came to a head on thursday as @entity34 district court judge @entity33 denied @entity1 and @entity2 ' request and ruled that the dispute should be aired out at trial			1
though @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 contended in their suit that " being reminiscent of a ' sound ' is not copyright infringement , " thursday 's ruling indicates the court believes that 's a question for a jury to mull over			1
both sides relied on the examination of musicologists to help make their arguments , but thursday 's ruling noted that the @entity16 family has made " a sufficient showing that elements of ' @entity7 ' may be substantially similar to protected , original elements of ' @entity18			0
' " according to @entity54 , a trial is set for february 10			0
in a statement , the lawyer for @entity1 and @entity2 said that thursday 's ruling is n't a surprise thanks to the " extraordinary difficulty " of trying to land a win at this stage of the process , " especially where each side offers conflicting opinions from multiple musicologists			0
" that said , the stars ' attorney added he and his clients are " gratified " that , per thursday 's ruling , " the jury will need to decide this case ... limited to what is in the written composition , without being influenced by the sound recordings			2
" " @entity7 " stayed at the top of @entity76 's pop chart for a record 16 weeks last year and sold more than 6 million copies , according to court documents			0
@entity0 's @entity79 contributed to this report .			0

the dispute over @entity1 's " @entity7 " is heading to trial
a judge ruled that there 's enough evidence for it to be presented to a jury
but jury will have to focus on sheet composition of the songs versus the recordings
