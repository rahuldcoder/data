@entity3 's parliament could pick the country 's leaders " in the distant future " rather than having @entity3 elect a president by popular vote , the @entity1 's supreme leader suggested sunday			1
ayatollah @entity9 floated the idea in a speech to university students in western @entity3 's @entity13 on sunday , according to a transcript posted on his website			1
though he couched the idea in conditional terms , his remarks come amid an ongoing power struggle between the country 's clerical leadership and its outspoken president , @entity22			1
" the current political system of the country is presidential , and the president is elected directly by the people			0
this is a good and effective system , " said @entity9 , who has led @entity3 since 1989			2
" but if one day , possibly in the distant future , it is felt that a parliamentary system is more suited for electing those responsible for the executive branch , then there would be no problems in making changes in the system			2
" @entity9 raised the subject himself after being asked about reaching ideals such as justice and freedom under the @entity41 system			0
his allies dominate the @entity43 , @entity3 's parliament , as well as the judiciary , and they have been critical of @entity22 in recent months			1
the supreme leader backed @entity22 through the tumult that followed his hotly disputed 2009 re-election , urging @entity3 to accept the results of the balloting when protesters in the streets declared it a fraud			1
@entity9 presided over a crackdown on the demonstrations , during which security forces were unleashed on crowds and activists were prosecuted and jailed			0
but sunday , he noted that the @entity1 's founder , ayatollah @entity60 , eliminated the post of prime minister in the 1980s and suggested the same thing could be done for the presidency			0
" of course , any change and modernization and reviewing of policies must be based on @entity41 principles			0
the changes must also conform with the @entity70 , " he said			0
but he added that the @entity3 system can manage change " without deviation from the path " of the 1979 revolution that ousted the country 's @entity77 - allied monarchy and brought the ayatollahs to power .			2

@entity3 could have parliament pick leaders " in the distant future , " @entity9 says
the suggestion comes amid a power struggle with @entity22
