-- immediately after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist acts , @entity1 came under attack			1
mistaken for @entity4 because of their beards and turbans , they became ripe targets for zealots seeking revenge			1
the first person murdered in retaliation for the 9/11 attacks was a @entity1 -- a gas station owner in @entity14 , @entity15 , named @entity16 who was shot five times by aircraft mechanic @entity19			1
in the intervening years , the @entity20 , a @entity21 - based advocacy group , reported more than 700 attacks or bias - related incidents			1
belief blog : who are @entity1 ? some @entity1 had their houses vandalized ; others were spat upon			1
in some extreme cases , @entity1 were set upon by groups of people and beaten			1
as the incidents waned , the community had hoped the worst was behind them -- until sunday , when a man shot and killed at least six people at a @entity1 temple outside @entity37 , wounded a police officer and was himself killed by another officer 's bullets			1
@entity43 @entity42 , 40 , an @entity44 veteran , was the gunman and was killed by an officer at the scene , police said monday			2
witnesses said the gunman had a 9/11 tattoo on one arm			2
police have received information that the suspect " may have been involved in " the white supremacist movement , but that has not been confirmed , @entity52 police chief @entity51 said			2
while the shooter 's motives are not yet known , what is clear is that the incident has dredged up the sense of shock and sadness @entity1 felt 11 years ago			1
@entity65 , from the @entity67 - @entity66 , said @entity1 growing up in the @entity68 should not feel as though they do n't belong			1
" everybody should feel at home , " he said sunday			2
" this nation belongs to everyone			2
" but little seems to have changed			0
the @entity68 is home to about 700,000 sikhs , nearly all of @entity75 origin			1
the men are easily identifiable by their beards and turbans , a tradition that 's lasted for 500 years			1
today , we are all @entity68 sikhs but the attire and appearance have also meant that they are often mistaken for @entity4 , and are targets of anti-islam attacks			1
" our appearance looks like @entity91 and those of @entity93 , " @entity86 , a friend of the @entity15 victim , said at the time of the first attack			0
" but we are different people from @entity4 people			2
we have different beliefs , a different religion			0
" because many of the incidents go unreported and because the @entity99 does n't specifically list them -- instead lumping them as " anti-islamic " crimes -- exact numbers are hard to come by			1
earlier this year , @entity21 rep. @entity102 sent a letter to the @entity104 to begin tracking crimes against @entity1			1
he asked that the @entity99 update its @entity106 ( 1 - 699 ) , which does not have a designation for crimes against @entity1 as it does for some other groups			1
" the more information our law enforcement agencies have on violence against @entity1 - @entity68 , the more they can do to help prevent these crimes and bring those who commit them to justice , " @entity102 said			1
here are some instances from the long list of attacks that @entity1 have faced since 9/11 : -- september 15 , 2001 : @entity121 guns down @entity86 outside a @entity14 gas station			1
@entity121 drives up to the station , fires five times and flees			0
he goes on to shoot at a @entity127 - @entity68 gas station clerk and fire into the home of an @entity93 - @entity68 family later the same day			1
he is serving a life sentence			0
-- december 2001 : two men beat store owner @entity132 20 times with metal poles in @entity135 while they utter , " we 'll kill @entity91 today			0
" -- march 2004 : vandals scrawl the words , " it 's not your country " in blue spray paint on the wall of the @entity144 temple in @entity145 , @entity146			0
the temple was also vandalized a year earlier			0
-- july 2004 : @entity148 is beaten unconscious by six men in @entity21 , after they taunt him and his friend about their turban			0
the beating leaves @entity153 with multiple fractures			0
-- august 2006 : @entity155 is stabbed in the neck with a steak knife in @entity158 , @entity146 , while he is standing in the carport of his house			0
the attacker later tells police he wanted to " kill a @entity163			0
" -- october 2008 : @entity164 is punched and kicked in the head while out on his daily walk in @entity167 , @entity168			0
the attacker does not take anything from @entity164			0
-- january 2009 : @entity171 is attacked outside a @entity21 grocery store , with men shouting racial slurs			0
two years later , his father is attacked			0
-- november 2010 : two passengers beat @entity177 , a @entity1 cabdriver , in @entity179 , @entity146 , with one of them calling him " @entity91			2
" -- march 2011 : @entity180 and @entity132 are gunned down in @entity181 , @entity146 , while out on their afternoon walk			0
they are not robbed and had no enemies , family members say			0
-- february 2012 : a @entity1 temple under construction in @entity188 , @entity189 , is defaced , with graffiti on the wall depicting a gun and a @entity194 cross			2
someone also scrawls " @entity198 , " perhaps in reference to the @entity4 prophet @entity197			2
@entity1 react to the @entity200 temple shooting @entity202 , the world 's fifth most popular religion , is a monotheistic faith that believes in equality and service to others , @entity1 officials say			2
@entity0 's @entity208 contributed to this report .			0
