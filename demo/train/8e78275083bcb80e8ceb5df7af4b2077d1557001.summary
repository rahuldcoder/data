the 2015 @entity0 stood up for free speech -- in more ways than one			1
the show will remembered for @entity6 and @entity7 's ( presumed ) last hosting hurrah , a running gag featuring @entity9 as a @entity11 representative and a couple of gasp - inducing @entity14 jokes			1
and as always , there were the usual bunch of what @entity17 called " rich , beautiful over-privileged people , " a few of whom , @entity17 included , definitely seemed to be enjoying their drinks			2
but the @entity0 also provided some stirring moments and hints of the awards season still to come : 1			1
standing up for free speech and social justice as we 've seen with the threats over " @entity32 " and the @entity34 tragedy , there are still many who have no respect for diverse opinions -- or diversity , period			1
in a rousing address , @entity39 , head of the @entity40 -- the journalists ' organization that puts on the @entity0 -- called out the need for free speech			1
" as international journalists , we understand the freedom of artistic expression			2

" together we will stand united against anyone that will repress free speech			1
anywhere , from @entity11 to @entity60			2
" he received a standing ovation			2

women take center stagethough women still have to fight for worthy movie roles -- " ' boyhood ' proves that there are still roles for women over 40 , as long as you 're hired while you 're still under 40 , " went one of @entity6 and @entity7 's zingers -- the @entity0 showed that they 're finding greater influence behind the scenes			1

and @entity126 , who won best actress in a tv miniseries or movie , was having none of the hand - wringing about women 's roles			1

@entity191 summed it up with her aggressive fanning			0
" boyhood " is the @entity195 front - runner on the drama side , however , there was no drama : " boyhood " won best picture , @entity197 won best director , and @entity204 won best supporting actress			1
