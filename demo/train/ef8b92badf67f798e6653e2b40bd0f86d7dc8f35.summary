-- it 's thousands of square miles wide , virtually devoid of oxygen and it has been blamed for an increase in shark attacks : the @entity6 " @entity7 " is getting bigger and forcing marine life -- including sharks - into shore			1
signs warn the public in an area harboring high bacteria near a drain at @entity16 , @entity17			0
the zone has been caused by a flood of nutrients , such as agricultural fertilizers , which boost algae production in the sea			1
these growths consume huge amounts of oxygen creating a " marine desert " almost devoid of life			0
the " @entity7 " varies in size each year , but in 1999 it was 7,728 square miles -- that 's nearly the size of @entity33 and @entity34 combined			1
the huge size of the " @entity7 ' is due to the increase in nutrient pollution flowing down rivers , including the @entity38 , which is estimated to have risen threefold in the last fifty years as chemicals become more and more common on farms			1
environmentalists fear that the drive to radically increase the amount of corn - based biofuels produced in the @entity46 from 15 billion gallons to 36 billion by 2022 could increase pollution in the @entity38 by 19 per cent			1
but the problem is by no means limited to @entity46 waters			0
similar " @entity55 " are being discovered across the world and a major @entity53 report in 2003 found that the number had doubled each decade since the 1960 's			1
the @entity53 report also warned that the number will continue to increase as intensive agriculture spreads around the world and that they are already having a significant impact on commercial fish stocks			1
all of this can come as quite a surprise			0
growing water demands , more pollutants think about pollution and you tend to imagine tall smoking chimneys or pipes pouring industrial effluent into our rivers and lakes			1
but the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly becoming a concern for environmentalists across the world			0
agriculture , including livestock and poultry farming , can be a source of a wide range of pollutants that find their way into our water supplies through run - off and leaching			0
this happens when rainfall exceeds the capacity of the ground and it flows into watercourses and groundwater supplies taking dissolved pollutants with it			0
these can include sediment from eroded land , as well as phosphorus and nitrogen compounds from chemical fertilizers and animal waste , which can also harbor disease pathogens			0
these pollutants can have a serious effect on water sources by depleting oxygen levels , stunting the growth of plants and even suffocating fish -- as in the @entity6 " @entity7			1
" the concentration of pollutants can be particularly high in drought years , when heavy water demand can reduce the flow rate in rivers and cut their ability to dilute chemicals			2
the effects of this can be acute in the developing world , where the pressure to feed a growing population combined with a low level of regulation can cause serious problems			0
a huge increase in the amount of synthetic chemicals being used in the @entity135 over recent years has caused substantial environmental damage to the country 's water supplies , according to a 2008 report by @entity140			1
between 1961 and 2005 fertilizer use in the @entity135 increased by 1000 percent			1
" this model of agricultural growth is fatally flawed because of declining crop yields and massive environmental impacts , " says @entity140 campaigner @entity142			2
" aside from causing land degradation and losses in soil fertility , agrochemicals cause water pollution that directly and indirectly affects human health			2
" according to @entity140 , analysis of groundwater in the @entity156 and @entity157 provinces in the @entity135 , found that 30 percent of tested wells had nitrates levels above the @entity160 ( @entity160 ) drinking water safety limit			1
the @entity162 ( @entity163 ) says that 37 per cent of water pollution in the country originates from agricultural practices			1
as well as causing an increase in the algal blooms that can cause " @entity55 , " agricultural nitrates have been identified as a factor in the growth of toxic " red tide " algae and high levels in drinking water can also pose a health risk to humans , especially children			1
agriculture 's impact on water pollution clearly there is a need to shift away from the current industrial agriculture system which promotes the reliance on agrochemicals while neglecting to consider their negative effects on human health , the environment , and the economy of local communities			2
the problem is particularly serious in @entity194 , where a combination of rapid development , a growing population and intensive agriculture has led to widespread pollution and even water shortages			2
scientists studying information from monitoring stations have said that 44 per cent of @entity194 rivers are polluted			2
" many lakes and water courses contain an excess of nutrients and need treatment before they are suitable as freshwater sources , " the @entity205 said in 2005			2
according to @entity194 state officials 10 per cent of farm land in the country is polluted posing a " severe threat " to food sources , with excessive agricultural chemical use being blamed , along with industrial effluent and solid waste			0
but controlling water pollution from agricultural run - off presents many challenges : it occurs over a wide area , goes across borders and often the source is hard to identify			2
it also varies over time and can increase or decrease depending on changes in land - use and ownership			0
lax local law enforcement , corruption and inefficiency can all compound the problem			0
legislators around the world are calling for a closer integration of environmental and agricultural policies , and more help for farmers in managing potentially hazardous substances			0
but many environmentalists see a solution with increased incentives for organic farming , which uses fewer chemicals and , argue groups such as the @entity250 @entity249 , with no appreciable decrease in yields			0
but while the solution remains a matter of debate , the scale of the problem continues to grow and grow			0

agricultural pollution has a caused a ' @entity7 ' in the @entity6
*globally* the number of @entity55 has doubled every decade since the 1960 's
the drive to increase biofuel production could increase pollution in rivers and seas
*pesticide* use rose 1000 percent in the @entity135 between 1961 and 2005
