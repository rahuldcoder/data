-- " dr. @entity1 , i want the works			1
" @entity4 , an attractive @entity5 woman in her mid- 40s , sat across from me in the consultation room			1
her eyes stared into mine , unwavering			1
" what do you mean by ' the works ? ' " i asked			1
" i want to enlarge my breasts , flatten my tummy , lift my neck and skinny my thighs			2
oh , and i want my eyes to tilt like @entity17 's , and i want you to plump my lips like @entity19 's			2
" she puckered and smacked her lips			2
" @entity4 , that 's a lot of plastic surgery			1
are you sure you need all this ? why do you want to have so much done ? " she paused			2
her face flushed a bright shade of crimson red			2
" because , " she seethed , " my husband left me for a younger woman			2
" revenge plastic surgery is becoming more common			1
a 2011 survey by the @entity36 in the @entity37 found that over a quarter ( 26 % ) of their patients were recently divorced women , while 11 % were newly single men			1
suffering from ' tattoo regret ' even @entity43 is getting involved in revenge surgery			1
" @entity46 " star @entity45 recently revealed in her book , " @entity48 and @entity49 and @entity50 , " that she spent $ 12,000 to undergo rejuvenation of her private parts after breaking up with her husband @entity53 ( who is now married to country singer @entity54 )			2
she even paid for it with his credit card			2
in my metro @entity60 plastic surgery practice , i estimate that 20 % of my new female patients have recently undergone a divorce			1
these patients usually fit into one of three categories			1
the largest group is recent divorcees who are back " on the market " and want to enhance their appearance to be more attractive to the opposite sex			1
a smaller group of newly single patients have always wanted to have plastic surgery but their ex-spouses disallowed it			1
the divorce frees them to finally go under the knife			0
and then there are patients such as @entity4 , who seek plastic surgery as a way to make their ex-spouses jealous			1
for them , plastic surgery is a way to gain the ex 's attention			1
it 's a " look - at - me - now ! " mentality			0
but recent divorcees may not be in the best mindset to make major medical decisions such as whether to have cosmetic surgery			1
in fact , according to the @entity92 and @entity93 stress scale , divorce ranks as one of the most stressful events that can occur during one 's life , second only to the death of a spouse			0
breasts , butts out in 2012 ; faces in so when i see newly divorced patients in my office , i encourage them to hold off on plastic surgery until they 're in a good mental state			1
that did n't stop @entity4 , though			0
one year later , she came back to see me			0
she arrived at my office dressed conservatively			0
her hair was unstyled and she wore no makeup , although her neckline was sharp and her lips were decidedly plump			0
the corners of her eyes were slanted upwards , like a cat , and her eyebrows were overly arched , resembling mr. @entity116			0
a disproportionately large bosom jutted out from her chest , causing the front of her shirt to hang over her flat tummy			0
we sat down across from each other in the consultation room			0
you look a little different			0
" " well , because you would n't operate on me , dr. @entity1 , i went to a different doctor			0
he performed a face lift , brow lift , lip plumping , eyelid tilting , breast augmentation , tummy tuck and liposuction , " she said , a serious look on her face			0
" wow , that 's a lot of surgery			1
" " yeah , i know			0
but my husband and i are back together , and we 've even renewed our vows			0
" " that 's great ! so what can i do for you ? " " the thing is , though , now that we 're back together , i figured out what i really want			0
" " and that is ? " " to look like my old self again			0
" the unsung heroes of medicine the names and identifying details of the patient were changed to protect her privacy .			0
