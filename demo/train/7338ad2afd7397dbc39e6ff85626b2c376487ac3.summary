he said court would be in recess until friday			0

the judge asked reporters not to question either side about it			2
the details of @entity8 's illness were not given			1
during a short break before the announcement , @entity8 drank a bottle of water quietly as attorneys spoke together and went back to @entity3 's chambers , according to @entity33 's @entity32			1
she was escorted out of the courtroom during the break , then brought back in , but lay her head down on her arms at the defense table			0
she did not stand as the jurors left the courtroom			0
in a statement released thursday evening , @entity44 spokesman , @entity41 said @entity8 had been returned to jail and was receiving medical attention from the facility 's health services provider			1
" no information can be released regarding her treatment or medical condition due to @entity53 and @entity54 and @entity55 , " @entity41 said			2
for security reasons , @entity41 also declined to state whether @entity8 would return to court friday			2
" @entity58 will never reveal the transport of any inmate in our custody due to the security risks posed by such knowledge being made public , " @entity41 said			0
earlier thursday , testimony centered on the recovery of the skeletal remains of her 2 - year - old daughter , @entity2 , from a wooded area in december 2008			1
@entity8 cried as photographs of the remains were displayed in the @entity73 courtroom and avoided looking at the screen where they were displayed			1

prosecutors allege @entity2 used chloroform on her daughter and suffocated her by putting duct tape over the little girl 's mouth and nose			1
they allege she put her daughter 's body in her car trunk before disposing of it			1
@entity2 's skeletal remains were found on december 11 , 2008 , less than a mile from the home of @entity2 's parents			1
@entity2 has pleaded not guilty and denied having anything to do with her daughter 's death			1
defense attorney @entity109 has said that when all the facts are known , it will become clear his client is innocent			0
as the photographs were displayed thursday , jurors heard testimony from @entity117 crime scene technician @entity116 , along with @entity118 , chief investigator for the medical examiner 's office , and @entity121 , @entity4 chief deputy @entity116 detailed items found with the little girl 's remains , including a black plastic bag , an off - white canvas bag , a red plastic @entity129 bag , a pair of shorts , a blanket and " clothing remnants			1
" duct tape could be seen on the facial region of the skull , she testified			0
@entity8 's parents , @entity139 and @entity2 , were not in the courtroom while the photos were shown thursday			1
jurors also heard a recording of a 911 call in which a utility worker reported that meter reader @entity146 claimed to have found a skull at the site where the remains were found			2
questioned by @entity109 , @entity116 agreed that it was paramount that a crime scene or remains not be tampered with , saying it could affect an investigation			2
numerous photographs were introduced into evidence of the skull , along with the duct tape on it and other items found at the scene , such as the canvas laundry bag			0
@entity121 testified the skull had its jawbone , or mandible , still attached , which was relatively rare given the stage of decomposition			0
the duct tape , he testified , was helping keep the jawbone attached , along with hair on the skull			0
thursday morning , jurors heard testimony from @entity2 's brother , who testified that his sister -- out of jail on bail the month after @entity2 was reported missing -- told him an alternate version of how the little girl was kidnapped by her nanny			1
he said his sister told him in august 2008 that she had met the nanny , @entity181 , at an @entity73 park along with @entity181 's sister			2
@entity2 told him that @entity181 held her down and told her that she was taking @entity2 from her because she was n't a good mother , " to teach her a lesson , " @entity8 said			1
@entity181 also warned her not to go to the police , according to @entity2 's account			1
@entity8 recalled his sister saying , " she could n't believe it was happening , and it felt kind of surreal to her , " he testified			2
she said she did nothing to stop her child from being taken , he recounted , because " she was scared and she did n't know what to do			0
" his sister told him that , from time to time , @entity181 would contact her through @entity2 's @entity199 page and direct her as to what to do and where to go			1
she went to the locations , she said , in hopes of seeing or retrieving her daughter but was never successful in finding her			2
@entity2 's account , as related by @entity8 , differed markedly from the one she gave authorities after @entity2 was reported missing			1
she maintained to police she dropped the child off at the nanny 's apartment that morning and never saw her again			0
authorities were never able to find the nanny			0
they did find a woman named @entity214 , who denied ever meeting @entity2 or @entity2 and later sued for defamation			2
" @entity217 never materialized ? " @entity109 asked @entity8 thursday			1
" to this day , no , " he replied			0
@entity8 also testified thursday that he was the one searching the internet on the @entity8 family computer july 15 and 16 , 2008			1
a computer examiner testified wednesday that no searches for @entity181 were found on the computer until july 16 -- dealing a potential blow to @entity2 's claims to authorities that she was frantically searching for her daughter in the month before her disappearance was reported			1
computer experts testified wednesday that in march , someone using the desktop computer , located in the home @entity2 shared with her parents , searched for terms including " chloroform , " " inhalation , " " how to make chloroform " and " head injury			2
" the searches were found in a portion of the computer 's hard drive that indicated they had been deleted , detective @entity244 of the @entity117 testified wednesday			0
however , she told jurors , deleted material remains on a computer 's hard drive and can be retrieved until it is overwritten by new data			2
it had not been overwritten on the @entity253 ' computer , she said , and " a complete internet history " was obtained			0
it appears the computer user first searched for " chloraform " on @entity258 and received results for " chloroform , " said @entity261 , owner of the software development company that created the software used to retrieve the data			0
one of the search results was from @entity265 , which was accessed , he testified			0
on the other terms , he said the user either typed those terms in to search , or in some instances may have clicked on hyperlinks on the @entity265 site			0
@entity261 agreed with @entity109 's assertion that the links do not tell jurors what was on the websites accessed , and that some sites could have been jokes or information on self - defense			0
he also agreed he could not say how closely the user was examining the websites or whether a user was looking at multiple browsers			0
there were two user - created profiles on the computer , but @entity289 told @entity109 she could not tell who performed the searches			0
despite her assertions , prosecutors allege @entity2 was not looking for her missing daughter during the month before police were notified of her disappearance			2
@entity8 's former boyfriend , friends and acquaintances who saw her during that time recalled her shopping , eating out , going to parties and hitting nightclubs , but all of them testified she never mentioned her missing daughter and none of them noticed any change in her demeanor			1
her mother testified that @entity8 had moved out of her parents ' home about the time @entity2 went missing , offering little in the way of explanation , and that when she inquired after @entity2 , she was told @entity2 was with her nanny , @entity181			1
earlier in the week , jurors heard testimony regarding a foul odor emanating from @entity2 's trunk			1
a scientist testified that compounds associated with human decomposition were found there , and a cadaver dog handler testified that his dog " alerted " to the trunk			0
in @entity33 's @entity32 contributed to this report			0
