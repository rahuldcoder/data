@entity0 -- six months after an earthquake devastated @entity3 , a @entity0 representative on the ground there says many challenges still lie ahead in the aftermath of the " worst living disaster			1
" @entity10 , the deputy special representative for the stabilization mission in @entity3 , told the @entity0 press via video - conference monday that progress has been made in rehabilitating the country , but that the nation still faces many problems			1
the january 12 quake left over 220,000 dead , over 300,000 injured , and over a million homeless			0
according to recent @entity0 reports , the quake destroyed 60 percent of government infrastructure , and left more than 180,000 homes uninhabitable			1
six months later , more than 1.5 million remain in overcrowded displacement camps , and @entity10 does not anticipate the number in camps to reduce soon			0
according to the @entity0 , 1,300 camping sites and 11,000 latrines have been built , and thousands of kilos of food and humanitarian resources have been delivered to those in need			1
@entity10 said that despite a lack of communication , destroyed roads and lack of transportation and railway systems , food was delivered relatively quickly to displaced @entity3			1
the response from the international community , @entity10 said , was " quite significant			0
" houses that were not structurally damaged are being rebuilt at a relatively low cost , though tents and camps are undergoing their second " phase of replacement			0
" an unforeseen difficulty of " land tenure , " especially in a " place where land ownership has been disputed for years , " has significantly slowed down the process of building more permanent houses in preparation for the hurricane season			0
" it is important to remember what @entity3 was and what @entity57 was before the earthquake : two - thirds of the population was living in poverty , many lacked access to clean water and were living in slums , " @entity10 said			1
according to 2009 @entity0 reports , 55 percent of @entity3 lived on less than $ 1.25 a day , and per capita annual income was us $ 660			1
fifty - eight percent of children were under - nourished and 58 percent of the population lacked access to clean water			1
the earthquake followed the devastating 2008 hurricanes that affected 800,000 @entity3 , and deforestation left the country with less than 2 percent forest cover			2
" then , the catastrophic earthquake left 230,000 dead , 300,000 injured and an estimated one million homeless			0
in addition , 17 million cubic meters of debris were scattered on the streets , " @entity10 explained			0
@entity10 said the relocation of displaced families from the camps to newly built homes has posed a problem because of two main concerns on the part of family members : the need for a job and for a nearby school where their children could receive an education			2
furthermore , the private sector , which has been damaged by the " overwhelming response from the international community , " has experienced a loss of clients and " extremely high interest rates " that @entity10 said can be solved only through recapitalization of the private sector by the country itself			0
but with a focus more on urban reconstruction and the development of a closer link between government and education , @entity10 said @entity3 could become a better nation than it was before the earthquake			2
" we have a long way to go , but things could have been much worse			0
" nutritional status and general health " has not worsened in the months since the earthquake , " he said			0
" there has been no epidemic of cholera or measles , " @entity10 stated , because access to clean water and free medical facilities have reduced chances of an outbreak			1
he asserted even that the @entity0 mission has seen improvement in some of the camps .			2
