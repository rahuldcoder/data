-- there will be no room for homophobia at the 2014 @entity4 , according to @entity6 owner and co-chairman @entity7			1
when the three - day event , taking place between may 8 - 10 , rolls into town , much of the media 's attention is likely to be focused on @entity13 -- the former @entity14 defensive end who came out as gay in february			1
the college football star is expected to be drafted in the latter rounds , and if so , he will become the first active player in the @entity4 to have publicly declared his homosexuality			1
a handful of teams are reportedly interested in recruiting the 24 - year - old , and @entity23 insists that -- regardless of @entity13 's sexuality -- he would have him at the 49ers should he be deemed good enough			1
" if he is the right person and we have a need at that position and he shows the capability on film , what his sexual orientation is would not matter in our locker room , " @entity7 told @entity0			2
@entity13 's decision to come out earlier this year means he joins the growing list of sports stars who have opted to reveal their homosexuality			1
former @entity43 international footballer @entity42 , @entity45 featherweight boxer @entity44 and @entity47 player @entity46 have all come out in recent years , however , they have decided to do so during the latter stages of their careers			2
a small number of @entity4 players , too , have chosen to come out in the past , but only once their professional careers had come to an end -- starting with @entity55 in 1975			1
the prospect of @entity13 becoming the first openly gay athlete in the league is simply a natural progression for the sport , according to @entity23 , given that @entity55 's own admission occurred nearly 40 years ago			1
" the truth of the matter is even though we have n't had players who are playing come out openly , we 're further along in this curve than people want to make out , " he said			0
" i think it 's just natural that there are players in any sport and in any other area of business that there are people of different orientations throughout the population			0
" should @entity13 move on to the 49ers next month , he could find himself lining up next to @entity78 , who has also had his own personal problems to deal with			1
@entity78 , who arrived in @entity80 from the @entity81 last month , was the target of harassment and bullying from three former teammates			2
an independent report found the 24 - year - old had been the victim of " sexually explicit remarks " and " racial insults " from @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 , while it was revealed that @entity78 contemplated suicide as a result of their actions			0
but while there has been much sympathy for the offensive tackle in the weeks since , some have suggested he broke the locker room 's code of silence -- a claim that @entity23 is quick to refute			0
" no i do n't believe so , " he said			0
" the locker room needs to be a professional atmosphere			0
" obviously there 's an element of privacy that 's in the locker room but there 's also an element that needs to be professional and @entity78 will be a part of that professional locker room in the 49ers			2
" @entity7 added : " there is a code of conduct that needs to be modeled everywhere , no matter where it is			2
people have to be treated with respect , with dignity and given the opportunity to maintain their own lives			0
" @entity23 feels the signing of @entity78 , who has worked with 49ers head coach @entity127 in the past , is proof that his team is doing its best to further the @entity4 's boundaries			1
" i think that we 've played a role in that being the @entity80 bay area in trying to be a leader and recognizing that individual rights play a role within sports as they do in the rest of the world , " he said			2
expanding @entity4 's reach while @entity23 is keen to further the @entity4 's boundaries when it comes to giving players room to express themselves for who they are , he is also committed to helping the sport expand overseas			1
the @entity4 's profile in @entity147 is continuing to grow , with @entity149 's @entity148 having hosted the @entity150 since 2007 , while there has even been talk of a franchise based in the nation 's capital			1
the @entity156 -- whose owner @entity157 also owns @entity160 side @entity159 -- are reportedly the most likely to relocate to @entity149			0
@entity23 , a former chairman of the @entity4 's international committee , believes a franchise in @entity149 would be a great way to boost the sport 's popularity outside of the @entity167 , although he does not necessarily feel a team would need to relocate across the @entity169 completely			1
" i do n't think it will ever come down to that choice [ of moving ] because i think it 's a totally different market			0
i think it will be fantastic to have a franchise in both @entity175 and @entity149 , " he said			0
" [ but ] i think you 're going to have to develop a new way to think about the way teams play			0
" @entity7 added : " there are times where you play three games away [ in a row ] or you play three games at home [ each season ]			2
we look at that right now as a potential flaw in the schedule			0
" but when you take a team and put them at the distance that @entity149 is from the west coast of the @entity167 , all of a sudden maybe that 's not a flaw , maybe that 's a good point			0
