-- @entity1 's never pulls punches in his stand - up , but there is a joke in his new comedy special that really pushes the envelope ( forget worrying about a spoiler ; we could n't tell it here if we wanted to )			1
let 's just say it involves child molestation , and the audience loves it			2
the " @entity16 " star said he does n't worry about getting caught on the wrong side of the politically correct crew as has happened to some comedians			2
" i think you have to take that all case by case to see if it makes sense , " he said			2
his new special , " @entity1 : buried alive , " will debut on november 1 on @entity26			1
the comic is known for being innovative in getting his comedy to fans and said the online streaming service made sense to him			1
" i think people now just like to watch stuff , whatever they want and watching whenever , " he said during a conference call about his new project			0
" i 've done every kind of method , like releasing my stuff for $ 5			0
" one clip from the special that has been making the rounds on @entity49 features @entity1 poking fun at the institution of marriage and family , life events a few of the 30 - year - old 's friends are experiencing now			1
" i write stand - up about whatever is kind of going on in my life , whatever is in my head , " he said			0
" and i ended up writing the special mostly about that			2
" @entity1 prowls the stage at the @entity60 in @entity61 , where the special was filmed , dressed in a suit with a flower on his lapel			1
his jokes cover a lot of ground , from the aforementioned pedophilia to marriage equality			0
on the controversy surrounding the @entity74 boycott , he said it was a bit of a conundrum : " obviously i 'm very pro gay marriage , but i 'm also very pro delicious chicken sandwich			0
" @entity1 also takes on those in his generation and how different they are from those of past generations , who , to @entity1 , seem more elegant			1
" if those generations could be a font , they would be @entity86 , " he said			0
" i look at my generation , we 're f * * * ing @entity89 ! you ca n't take us seriously , we 're @entity89 ! " yes , he 's getting older , but @entity1 said he does n't miss being in his 20s , other than " being able to say you 're in your 20s			1
" @entity1 , who started doing standup while a student at @entity96 , said today 's aspiring comics should focus on their material			1
" ( @entity100 comedians ) are like , ' oh , i got to start making videos and i got to maintain a @entity103 thread on this site , ' " he said			0
" i think that is probably doing more harm than good , because all i really cared about was being really good at stand - up			0
" and while he is aware that his tv show , " @entity16 , " has some rabid fans , he said he thinks his stand - up fans are n't necessarily there because he 's on the @entity113 comedy			1
" whenever i do stand - up , i feel like those are people that know my stand - up , " he said			0
" there might be some overlap with ' @entity120 ' fans , but when i did my first theater tour , if i mentioned my cousin @entity123 or something , everyone would respond , so i think that means that they 've seen the stand - up			2
i do n't feel there are many people that are seeing ' @entity120 ' and then they 're like , ' oh , let me spend x amount of dollars to see this guy do stand - up			0
