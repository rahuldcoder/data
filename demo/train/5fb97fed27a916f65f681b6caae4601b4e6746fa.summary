-- it 's another day of fast - moving events in @entity3 , and you 're a little fuzzy on the details			1
so we 're here to catch you up			0
ok , so what 's happening in @entity3 today ? a lot			2
to be brief , @entity3 's ousted president sounded pretty defiant talking to reporters from @entity13			1
he fled @entity3 days ago but insisted that he remained the legitimate elected leader and that he would not give up			2
in @entity19 , a @entity18 region of southern @entity3 , armed men in military uniforms alarmed @entity3 officials by showing up suddenly outside two airports in the region			1
so men with guns showed up unannounced at airports ? what ? though it is an alarming development , that in and of itself does n't seem to be quite the " armed invasion " interior minister @entity27 suggested it was			2
the camo - clad squads showed up toting automatic weapons outside the main airport in the regional capital , @entity36 , as well as at a joint military - civilian airport near @entity13 's big military base in @entity39			2
they did n't seem to do much but look tough			0
later , @entity3 officials said they were able to stop the squads from taking over the airports without using any weapons			1
ok , remind me again how the tension in @entity3 all got started ? the short version is that @entity3 has long been split between folks who look west toward @entity48 and those who tend to lean @entity49 toward @entity13			1
last year , now - ousted president @entity50 decided to scrap a @entity48 trade deal that promised long - term rewards in favor of a pile of quick cash offered up by @entity13			1
the pivot toward @entity13 set off protests by the @entity59 crowd that climaxed in deadly clashes with security forces last week			2
dozens died before a @entity48 - brokered peace deal ended the fighting			0
but @entity50 fled before the deal could all be implemented , first to @entity18 strongholds in @entity3 , then finally to @entity13			1
what did the ousted president say today ? and why is he in @entity13 ? pretty much this : i 'm still president			1
i had to leave @entity3 because people kept trying to kill me			2
and " western powers " are to blame for all of this chaos			0
he also said that he wo n't ask @entity13 president @entity76 for military muscle to help restore him to power , and seemed to reject talk of splitting up @entity3 into pro-european and @entity18 halves			1
so who 's in charge in @entity3 and what are they doing about all this ? @entity3 's @entity87 says it 's running things			0
lawmakers have named an interim president , started to set up a new government and called elections for may			0
they 've also been talking tough to @entity13 about keeping its military on its leash and avoiding anything that seems provocative			0
why does @entity13 care so much ? why does the @entity96 care what 's happening in , say , @entity98 ? pretty much the same reasons apply -- the two countries have traded territories back and forth , they have a shared border and there are lots of business and cultural associations			0
@entity3 is literally on @entity13 's doorstep			1
it 's home to the country 's @entity109 naval fleet			0
@entity3 used to be one of the republics in the @entity113 , and @entity19 used to belong to @entity13			1
the countries are big trading partners , and @entity3 hosts part of @entity13 state - owned natural gas provider @entity118 's network of pipelines that serve @entity48 markets			1
what 's going to happen next ? who knows , but keep an eye on @entity19			0
pro-russian forces still hold several government buildings , and lawmakers there have voted out a government they saw as too pro-kiev			0
with so many ethnic @entity13 and a big @entity13 military presence there , it 's a potential flashpoint			0
@entity132 : how @entity3 is divided			0

armed squads appear at @entity19 airports
ousted @entity3 president speaks defiantly *...* from @entity13
meanwhile , @entity3 *parliament* continues to build new government
