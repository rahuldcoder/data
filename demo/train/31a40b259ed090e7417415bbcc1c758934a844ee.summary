president @entity2 could take action as early as next week to protect undocumented immigrants with @entity6 - born children and those who entered the @entity6 as children themselves from deportation , an administration official familiar with the plan told @entity9			1
the official said @entity2 could sign an executive order bypassing lawmakers and implementing those changes on his own by next week -- though the @entity14 says it has n't nailed down the timing or content and that final decisions wo n't come until @entity2 returns from his @entity19 trip			1
the move has been the subject of months of anticipation			2
but with lame duck legislative wrangling underway on @entity27 , the president 's advisers could also wait until next month			2
while not specifying when @entity2 might make his move , the @entity14 said thursday he 's nearing a final decision on how to repair a system both @entity31 and @entity32 admit needs fixing			1
and while officials say the specifics of what he will announce have n't been finalized , the broad contours of a potential plan that eases deportations for millions of undocumented immigrants have been floated by immigration groups for months			1
for the multitude of groups who are watching the process unfold , the moment is charged			2
" without hesitation i can say the level of anticipation is intense			2
we were hoping this would happen in september , " said @entity52 , deputy vice president of the @entity53			2
" it 's long overdue			2
" millions affected an expansion of @entity2 's " deferred action " program ( @entity59 ) that went into place in the summer of 2012 is considered by immigration activists a likely component of @entity2 's immigration action			1
@entity59 delayed deportation proceedings for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the @entity6 by their parents as children			2
there were caveats on who was eligible : in order to apply , immigrants needed to be younger than 31 at the time the rule was enacted , and younger than 16 when they were brought to the @entity6 and applicants are required to either be in school , have earned a high school degree , or be honorably discharged veterans			0
the @entity79 , a nonpartisan think tank , says 1.2 million people were eligible under those rules and nearly 700,000 applied for deferred deportation , with hundreds of thousands more aging into the requirements over the next decade			0
but many more would become eligible if @entity2 expands , or eliminates altogether , those requirements , which were meant to encompass the same sector that would have qualified for permanent resident status under the @entity87 , which has languished in @entity88			1
that could mean extending deportation relief to the parents of @entity6 citizens , a move that would bring another 3.4 million people into the eligibility ranks , according to a @entity79 analysis			0
if the parents of children who are eligible under the current @entity59 rules are also included , the number rises to 3.7 million			0
changing those rules could also expand the eligible population : eliminating the education requirement , for example , would allow 430,000 more undocumented immigrants to be eligible for deferred deportation , the @entity79 estimates			0
and allowing people over 30 who were brought to the @entity6 by undocumented parents would allow another 200,000 immigrants to apply , the think - tank 's report says			0
immigration activists , frustrated with the rate of deportations under @entity2 and further exasperated with the delay in @entity2 's immigration action , have been urging the @entity14 to go big and expand the deferred deportation order in a way that allow the maximum number of people to stay			1
but many who have been watching the process closely believe the eventual announcement will fall short of those appeals			0
" we have been making the case all along with activists and scholars that the president could provide relief to millions of people			0
i do n't think they will , " said @entity130 , the advocacy director at immigrants ' rights group @entity131			0
" i think they will try to couch that as ' these are our political constraints			0
' " political football whatever @entity2 finally decides -- and at this point , the options seem clear -- he 'll be met with fierce blowback from @entity31 on @entity27 , who have spent months preparing for the announcement by warning of executive overreach and political well - poisoning			1
the @entity14 yielded to politics once already , delaying the immigration announcement from its promised debut this summer to a new date before the end of this year			1
the move was meant to shield vulnerable @entity32 from political attacks on the topic ; many of them lost their races anyway			0
the postponement was n't met kindly from immigration groups , who said there was n't time to spare on providing deportation relief for the millions of people who could be affected by new rules			1
this time the @entity14 seems intent to get the announcement done before the @entity166			0
@entity2 vowed action during a post-election press conference last week and @entity169 , his press secretary , reiterated the end - of - year goal during a press conference in @entity172 thursday			1
there could still be election year ramifications , since @entity32 sen. @entity175 remains locked in a runoff contest with a @entity31 rival			1
but with the @entity179 firmly in @entity31 hands , any further delay would seem to offer little political advantage while only eroding support further among immigration reform activists			1
" for us , every day that there 's a delay , and every day that people have to wait , means more people unjustly deported , " said @entity130			0
some democrats want @entity2 to wait to announce the executive action after essential business clears the @entity14 and @entity179			1
sen. @entity192 , the outgoing @entity193 , told @entity9 the president should hold off any immigration action until a new bill funding the federal government is approved			1
he said enacting the immigration plan ahead of the spending measure could anger @entity31 and risk a government shutdown			1
" i 'd like to get the finances of this country out of the way before he does it			0
but it 's up to him , " @entity192 said			0
but no matter when the action comes , it seems destined to ignite @entity31 furor			0
the near certainty of an executive action by year 's end has n't slowed @entity31 efforts to stop it : this week a @entity31 congressman from @entity216 , rep. @entity217 , said if @entity2 goes forward with the plan , impeachment proceedings could be a possibility			1
those threats are n't exactly a new thing			0
@entity32 have raised millions of dollars by warning their party 's base about impeachment threats from conservative @entity14 members			0
more real is the threat that taking executive action on immigration forestalls any legislative effort on the matter			2
@entity31 leaders on @entity27 say a new plan delaying deportations would enrage @entity31 , leaving little political will to push through a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration system			2
@entity2 seems little concerned by @entity31 threats against making the immigration move , however , pointing out they had an opportunity to pass a bipartisan reform measure in the @entity14 but balked			1
" i feel obliged to do everything i can lawfully with my executive authority to make sure that we do n't keep on making the system worse , " he said during last week 's news conference .			0
