-- @entity2 football club @entity1 completed the signing of @entity4 from @entity6 side @entity5 sunday , to end weeks of speculation over one of the off - season 's most anticipated transfer deals			1
@entity4 joins the @entity12 giants for six seasons , @entity1 said on its website , and he will be unveiled at @entity1 's @entity15 monday at 1 p.m. local time			1
neither club has disclosed the value of the deal but @entity21 media outlets @entity22 and the @entity23 reported it was a world - record move worth $ 132 million that was greater than the $ 124 million fee @entity1 produced to lure @entity27 away from @entity28 in 2009			1
according to a pair of @entity2 newspapers , though , @entity4 's switch was n't a world record			1
@entity33 put the transfer value at about $ 120 million on sunday , just as @entity35 did earlier in the weekend			0
whatever the amount , @entity4 was thrilled while thanking @entity5 for some " special times			2
" " i am not sure there is ever a good time to leave a club where i felt settled and was playing the best football of my career to date , " @entity4 told @entity5 's website			1
" i know many players talk of their desire to join the club of their boyhood dreams , but i can honestly say , this is my dream come true			0
" @entity5 chairman @entity50 said the club had no intention of selling @entity4 but the " attention " from @entity1 and the player 's own wishes ultimately took precedence			1
likely in anticipation of @entity4 's departure -- and the money on the way -- @entity5 had signed seven players this summer			1
" such has been the attention from @entity1 and so great is @entity4 's desire to join them , that we have taken the view that the player will not be sufficiently committed to our campaign in the current season , " @entity50 told @entity5 's website			1
" we have , therefore , with great reluctance , agreed to this sale and do so in the knowledge that we have an exceptionally strong squad to which we have added no fewer than seven top internationals			0
" more importantly , we have an immense team spirit and a dressing room that is hungry for success			0
" the 24 - year - old @entity77 has twice been named the @entity78 in @entity79 for his outstanding performances for @entity5 , most recently in the 2012 - 13 season where he scored 26 goals in 44 appearances			0
but this was not enough to lift the @entity87 club into the @entity88 after they finished fifth in the @entity6			2
speculation about @entity4 's future reached fever pitch during over the transfer window that followed			0
@entity4 , an attacking player who is normally deployed in a wide position , joined @entity5 from his first club @entity94 in 2007			2
he has made 41 appearances for his country since his debut in 2006 , scoring 11 goals			0
" i am well aware that i would not be at the level i am today were it not for firstly @entity94 and then @entity5 standing by me during some of the tougher times and affording me the environment and support they have , " @entity4 said			2
" @entity5 will always be in my heart and i 'm sure that this season will be a successful one for them			0
i am now looking forward to the next exciting chapter in my life , playing football for @entity1			0
" if the @entity21 reports about @entity4 's fee are correct , it would mark the latest occasion that @entity1 have broken the world transfer record , dating back to the signing of @entity117 's @entity116 from arch rivals @entity118 in 2000			1
the record was again broken when @entity122 @entity121 star @entity120 signed from @entity124 @entity123 in 2001			0
the $ 82.58 million fee remained the record until @entity1 broke it twice in 2009 , first acquiring @entity127 's @entity126 from @entity128 and then @entity27 , who remains a key figure at the @entity130			2
new manager @entity131 will be hoping the attacking combination of @entity4 and @entity27 will herald a new era of domination for a club who have won the @entity88 , formerly @entity88 , a record nine times , but not since 2002			2
@entity1 , then managed by @entity139 , had to play second fiddle in @entity12 last season to @entity118 and were beaten in the semifinals of the @entity88 by @entity143			0
@entity4 did n't play in @entity5 's 1 - 0 defeat at @entity145 on sunday .			1

@entity4 has signed for @entity2 club @entity1
@entity4 leaves from @entity6 @entity5
@entity4 will be unveiled monday *afternoon* at @entity1 's *stadium*
the fee was n't disclosed but some @entity21 outlets say it 's a world record
