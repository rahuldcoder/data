-- my daily trek to work is the last place i would expect to encounter a hateful message			2
but @entity7 blogger @entity6 is determined to make that happen to me and my fellow commuters			1
this week , at 10 subway stations around @entity12 , commuters will encounter ads from the virulently anti-islam group headed by @entity6 , the @entity15			1
@entity6 has been cited both by the @entity16 and the @entity17 for her anti-muslim activity			0
the subway ads say , " in any war between the @entity21 and the @entity22 , support the @entity21			1
" below that are the words : " @entity24			0
defeat @entity25 , " with a @entity26 on either side of the phrases			0
the coded message makes clear who the savages are : those who support jihad , which in @entity6 's mind includes all @entity35			1
she has called @entity37 " an extreme ideology , the most radical and extreme ideology on the face of the @entity40			1
" as a rabbi , i find the ads deeply misguided and disturbing			2
the @entity45 community is deep in the heart of our @entity47 , the @entity49 that encompass the holy days of @entity51 and @entity52			0
one of the most powerful moments in the holy days is when the community rises for a recitation of public confession , beginning tuesday night			0
i have always been struck by how many of the foibles of daily life have to do with speech			0
the words from our mouths have power : once released , whether intentionally or by accident , what we say shapes reality			0
it can bring about healing or atonement , or it can unleash violence and hatred			1
@entity6 's ads , sharply dividing the world into civilized people and savages , are only intended to hurt and tear fragile relationships apart			1
' @entity25 ' ad to appear in @entity12 subway stations at first , the @entity80 rejected the ads , but a district judge ruled the ads were protected under the @entity84			1
the ads follow similar ads in @entity87 as well as posters at @entity12 's @entity90 train stations that made unsubstantiated claims about the number of people killed in terrorist attacks since 9/11			1
the @entity90 ads denied their bigotry by stating , " it 's not @entity7			1
it 's @entity99 , " claiming the actions of a few represented the " reality " of @entity37			1
but when did it become acceptable to spread bigotry against any @entity107 religious , racial or ethnic group in the name of " realism " ? as an @entity107 , i believe in the right to free speech , even when i detest the message or disagree vehemently with the messenger			1
but i can still raise my voice against words of hatred			0
moreover , freedom of speech does not absolve our elected officials from denouncing hateful rhetoric			0
a key part of their jobs as our representatives is to uphold core @entity107 values of pluralism and inclusion			0
unfortunately , @entity12 's public officials have largely been silent about the message of hate that will confront all of us during our morning commutes			1
in a recent radio broadcast , @entity12 mayor @entity134 explained the court 's decision regarding the ads and affirmed the right of freedom of expression as an @entity107 value			1
he said that " as @entity107 , we tolerate things that we find despicable , " but fell short of condemning the ads. i have only to look at the news of the past several months to see how unchecked messages of hatred manifest themselves into acts of violence			1
the growing number of attacks against mosques in places such as @entity155 , @entity156 , and the killings in august at the @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 temple are the extreme end of a growing domestic threat against religious minorities			0
here in @entity12 , hate crimes surrounding @entity35 religious services and at a @entity167 memorial site have been committed			2
these acts of hatred are not individual tragedies but for all of us as @entity107			2
as a jew , i know the extreme to which where baseless hatred can lead			0
and the @entity45 community has been in the past a target of hatred in the @entity107			0
@entity6 's message ignores the positive contributions that our @entity35 friends , neighbors and colleagues make to our country every single day			2
it is also unfortunate that @entity6 chooses to frame her message of hatred as one of support for @entity24			2
the complicated struggle for peace in the @entity193 and against terrorism must not be reduced to a simplistic message of a war between good and evil			0
although there is considerable debate within the @entity45 community about how to best support @entity24 and achieve peace with her neighbors , it is clear that part of our contribution as @entity107 is to show the world that religious pluralism is both possible and beneficial for a thriving democracy			0
in @entity107 , no one should have to live in fear for his or her safety because of faith			0
if there is a silver lining to the events of the past few months , including the subway ads , it is that @entity107 of all religions have the opportunity to come together and loudly reaffirm their commitments to religious pluralism			2
together , we have and will continue to show that speech can also heal			0
it is time for all of us , regardless of belief , or nonbelief , to stand together and reject stoking bigotry and hatred in our city with these ads. our goal should be healing , not rupture , and laying the foundation for peace within our community and around the world			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity242 .			2

group posts ads in @entity12 subway stations with coded message @entity37 is " savage "
anti-islam blogger 's group also put up ads calling " @entity7 " " @entity252 "
@entity242 says *unopposed* messages of hatred stir acts of violence
she supports the right to free speech but believes we must stand against bigotry
