it was @entity2 's handling of the report into bidding for the 2018 and 2022 @entity4 that convinced @entity5 it was time to take a stand			1
the 42 - year - old , a man of formidable football pedigree , confirmed to @entity0 in an exclusive interview on wednesday he wants to replace @entity12 as president of world soccer 's governing body			1
after growing weary at @entity2 's increasingly tarnished reputation , he 's asked supporters the world over to follow his crusade to rehabilitate an organization he says has become a byword for scandal			1
the tipping point came towards the end of 2014 , when @entity2 opted not to publish a report by @entity27 lawyer @entity26 into allegations of corruption during the race to host the 2018 and 2022 @entity4 , releasing its own summary of his findings instead			1
" i think that was the moment of change and the moment i thought something had to be done , " @entity5 told @entity0 anchor @entity33			1
" if you are transparent and if you ask for an investigation , a report , which you have nothing to hide , why do n't you make public that report ? if you have nothing to hide about that , you have to do it			0
" having decided to run , and with a trophy - laden career to bolster his credibility , @entity5 now must convince the majority of @entity2 's 209 member associations that he means business			1
the former @entity53 captain has made transparency a key plank of his pitch for soccer 's top job , underlining that a change in leadership and governance is the only way to revitalize @entity2 's reputation			1
he also vowed to release more of @entity2 's vast financial reserves to its federations in the hope of boosting the sport at grass roots level			1
and he gave short shrift to any suggestion that his candidacy was a publicity stunt , an accusation leveled at former @entity75 international @entity74 who recently launched his bid alongside a bookmaker and confirmed he was being paid for his involvement			0
" i do n't need to be a candidate to get publicity			0
i had a fantastic career and i 'm very proud of so many years playing at a high level , " explained @entity5			2
" i 'm not getting paid			0
fortunately i have a situation that allows me to pay for my candidature , and i 'm lucky that i can pay my travels and support my expenses			0
" i think the organization is right now not a football organization -- it is more a political organization , " he added referring to @entity2			1
" we have to care about the future of football , try to restore the leadership , the governance and big transparency and solidarity with the federations			0
" @entity5 does not want for style or substance , but his decision to take aim at @entity12 is a gamble			2
the 78 - year - old has been ensconced in @entity2 's corridors of power since 1998 and still enjoys firm support among its member associations despite the increasingly beleaguered nature of his rein			1
many commentators see may 's election as a forgone conclusion , but even if @entity5 is the only candidate to make his way onto the ballot paper it will still represent progress from 2011 's ballot			1
back then , @entity119 's former @entity2 member @entity118 withdrew from the race after he was suspended on bribery charges , leaving @entity12 to run unopposed			1
@entity5 joins a list of presidential hopefuls that includes @entity74 , independent candidate @entity124 , @entity126 vice-president prince @entity125 and @entity127 , the head of @entity129 football			1
of those names , it is arguably only @entity5 who has the potential to loosen @entity12 's stranglehold on @entity2 's top job			1
" i can say i 'm a real candidate after today and i 'm looking forward to opening the debate and trying to get the support of many federations to have the chance to be the president , " added @entity5			1
" i think to [ take ] this step you have to be prepared			0
of course i did my homework but i have a lot of things that i have to learn , to improve , but if your mind is open i think it 's much more easy			0
" i have my ideas about what is football and what is good for improving @entity2 but i think my experience of my career is a positive thing that allows me to understand a lot of the game			1
my first priority is to know from the federations what they need			0
" i think one important thing is to increase the solidarity payments to the federations , because right now @entity2 has so many financial reserves that belong to the federations			2
" @entity5 : a modern footballing great @entity5 's glittering , and at times controversial , career began with @entity168 in @entity169 before he moved to @entity171 giants @entity170 in 1995 , quickly establishing himself as one of its best players			1
alongside an all - star cast that included @entity177 pair @entity176 and @entity178 , as well as @entity129 striker @entity179 , @entity5 was part of the @entity170 team that won back - to - back @entity184 titles in 1998 and 1999			2
he also won five cup competitions in @entity186 , including the @entity187 and the @entity188 in 1997			0
by this time @entity5 had established himself as one of the finest players in the world and one who was adored by the club 's fans			1
so when it was announced he was leaving to join @entity170 's biggest rival , @entity196 , it was seen as not just a betrayal of the club but the whole region			0
then @entity170 president @entity200 reacted to news that @entity196 had activated @entity5 's £ 37.5 million ( $ 56m ) buyout clause by vowing : " i wo n't forget this			1
someone who does this to me will pay for it			0
" @entity5 was denounced as a " money - grabber " and was afforded a vitriolic reception on his first visit to @entity170 's @entity211 stadium with his new club , though it would intensify in the 2003 season as coins , bottles and even a pig 's head was thrown at him by a rancorous home support			2
but his defection to the @entity220 helped @entity196 re-establish themselves as @entity171 's pre-eminent force as they won the @entity184 title in 2001 , going on to secure a prized @entity223 crown the following season			0
his signing kick - started @entity196 's " @entity230 " brand with stellar names such as @entity228 , @entity178 and @entity229 also acquired			0
by the time @entity5 left for @entity231 in 2005 he had collected seven trophies -- the same amount he won at @entity170			2
in @entity234 , @entity5 won four successive @entity236 titles , one @entity237 and three @entity238 before retiring in 2009			2
@entity5 also represented his national team with distinction , becoming the country 's most capped player with 127 appearances			2
@entity53 made the semifinals of @entity245 and went out of the 2002 @entity246 at the group stage before suffering a heart - breaking , shock defeat to @entity250 in the final of @entity252 , which it hosted			0
he retired from international football at the 2006 @entity246 , after he captained his side to the semifinals , where it was beaten by @entity75			0
the race to become president @entity5 's declaration means there are now five potential challengers to @entity12 's throne , but two important hurdles must be overcome before any of them can officially join the race			1
first , they need to prove " an active role in association football for two of the five years preceding his proposed candidature , " then demonstrate they 've got the backing of five of @entity2 's 209 member associations			1
@entity124 , an independent @entity75 candidate , was the first to declare his bid back in september , but revealed earlier this month he was struggling to attract five nominations			0
prince @entity125 , who has been the president of @entity277 football since 1999 , announced his intention to stand on january 6 but has said very little publicly about his campaign			2
it remains to be seen whether he can muster five backers , but @entity12 's stranglehold on power was underlined when the @entity126 confirmed its intention to support him instead of prince @entity125 , who is its vice-president			0
@entity74 , a former player with @entity75 champions @entity287 and @entity288 sides @entity290 and @entity291 , launched his bid in @entity292 on january 16 saying it was time to " reboot football			0
" but his charge was immediately undermined by the revelation that his bid was being backed by bookmaker @entity297 , who has a self - confessed penchant for mischief , and that he was being paid £ 250,000 ( $ 375,000 ) for his involvement			0
@entity74 's prospective bid is reliant on crowdfunding to help him through to may 's elections but so far it has only raised £ 6,300 ( $ 9,500 )			0
doubts also remain as to whether he 'll be able to find five associations to support him			0
@entity307 , who has been head of @entity129 football since 2008 , entered the fray earlier this week , vowing to " normalize and modernize " @entity2			2
the 66 - year - old was critical of @entity12 when the @entity312 backtracked on his decision to stand down after his current term as president ended , and is confident he has already secured five nominations			2
as part of his candidature , @entity307 is reportedly ready to offer @entity12 an advisory role if the @entity129 is elected @entity2 president			1
the deadline for applications was on thursday but it might be next week before @entity2 announces who has made their way onto the ballot paper for the election , held in @entity328 on may 29 .			0

@entity5 exclusively reveals to @entity0 he wants to become @entity2 president
@entity5 says @entity2 's handling of the @entity26 report in @entity4 bidding convinced him to stand
soccer 's governing body only published its own summary of lawyer 's findings
@entity5 says @entity2 is more of a political organization than a football one
