in 2010 , @entity0 were prescribed 258 million courses of antibiotics , a rate of 833 per thousand people			1
such massive usage , billions of doses , has been going on year after year			2
we have few clues about the consequences of our cumulative exposures			2
we do know that widespread antibiotic treatments make us more susceptible to invaders by selecting for resistant bacteria			1
these risks are now well - known , but i want to lay out a new concern : that antibiotic use over the years has been depleting the pool of our friendly bacteria -- in each of us -- and this is lowering our resistance to infections			1
in today 's hyperconnected globe , that means that we are at high risk of future plagues that could spread without natural boundaries from person to person and that we could not stop			1
i call this " antibiotic winter			1
" to explain : in the early 1950 's , scientists conducted experiments to determine whether our resident microbes -- the huge number of bacteria that live in and on our bodies , now called our " microbiome " -- help in fending off invading bacteria			2
they fed mice a species of a typical invader , disease - causing salmonella			1
it took about 100,000 organisms to infect half of the normal mice			2
but when they first gave mice an antibiotic , which kills both good and bad bacteria , and then several days later gave them salmonella , it took only three organisms to infect them			1
this is n't a 10 or 20 % difference ; it 's a 30,000-fold difference			2
that was in mice , but what about humans ? in 1985 , @entity60 faced a massive outbreak of salmonella			2
at least 160,000 people became ill and several died from drinking contaminated milk			2
the health department asked victims of the outbreak and unaffected persons , " have you received antibiotics in the month prior to becoming ill ? " people who said yes were five times more likely to become ill than those who drank the milk but had n't recently received antibiotics			1
people carry a small number of highly abundant bacterial species and a large number of much less common ones			2
for example , you may carry trillions of @entity81 in your colon and only a thousand cells , or fewer , belonging to many other species			2
we are not sure how many rare species any of us has			2
if you had only 50 cells of a particular type , it would be difficult to detect them against the background of trillions of others			0
when you take a broad - spectrum antibiotic , which is the kind most commonly prescribed , it may be that rare microbes occasionally get wiped out entirely			1
and once the population hits zero , there is no bouncing back			0
for your body , that species is now extinct			0
my worry is that some of these critical residential organisms -- what i consider " contingency " species -- may disappear altogether			0
why might it matter ? those puny species may not be so inconsequential			0
any small population of , say , 50 cells can explode into a billion or more in one week			0
the trigger for their massive bloom could be a food you 've eaten for the first time , which only they have the enzymes to digest			0
in the presence of this food , the rare microbe goes into overdrive , doubling every 12 or 20 minutes , multiplying by a million percent or more			0
this could be good for you because some of the energy captured by these digesting microbes might end up in your bloodstream			1
when food is in short supply , as has been the case for most of human existence , and people need to eat unfamiliar plants or animals , it is useful to have a repertoire of enzymes that help us process a wide variety of nutrients			1
the genes of our flexible partners , our resident microbes , provide those enzymes			0
now consider the consequences if one of your rare microbes -- an ancient one that has been dwelling in @entity157 for 200,000 years -- went extinct			0
one possibility is that it does n't matter			0
perhaps that microbe was a marginal player -- good riddance			1
another possibility : it 's a " contingency " organism , useful -- crucial -- when we need it for protection			0
when a new influenza epidemic arose in @entity171 in 2009 , people in @entity168 and @entity169 soon fell ill , and then flu appeared in @entity173 a few days later			0
after a few weeks , this flu spread throughout the world			1
considering the numbers of people infected , we were lucky that it was not a highly lethal strain			0
yet thousands of people all over the world did die			1
even when a strain is not that virulent , when hundreds of millions of people are infected , deaths add up			0
and when the strain is worse , the deaths climb into the millions			0
our world has gotten smaller			1
we have much greater global access to one another -- at the very moment in our history when our ancient microbial defenses are degrading			0
this makes us vulnerable to microbial invaders and provides fuel for disease conflagrations , with consequences scarcely imaginable			1
plagues are inevitable wherever people congregate			1
with a global population of 7 billion , rising by 80 million annually , the question is not whether another big plague will come , but when it will happen , what will cause it , and who will be affected			1
in 1918 - 19 , influenza killed tens of millions , in an era without airplanes and with much less mass transit to spread it			0
with a huge world population that is essentially contiguous , and with so many people with weakened defenses , we are vulnerable as never before			1
i see many parallels between our changing climate and our changing microbiome			0
the modern epidemics -- asthma and allergic disorders , obesity , and metabolic disorders -- are not only diseases , they are external signs of change within			0
but they also indicate a deeper imbalance , the loss of our reserves			0
our diverse microbes , with their millions of genes helping us resist disease , are the guerrilla warriors defending the home domain -- as long as we protect them			1
but recent studies suggest that otherwise normal people already have lost 15 % to 40 % of their microbial diversity and the genes that accompany it			0
this is the greatest danger before us -- invaders causing an epidemic against which we are helpless			1
unless we change our ways , we do indeed face an " antibiotic winter			1
" we must end the assault on our microbes , by cutting antibiotic use and also such elective practices as unnecessary cesarean sections that bypass the natural order of mothers passing on their bacteria to their babies			1
there are times when both of these are needed urgently , but we already know that we are overusing them			0
technology already provides important tools to improve doctors ' judgments about when antibiotics are needed , but we must get them into the clinic			1
we also must develop new tools , like " narrow - spectrum " antibiotics that target only the invader and minimize collateral effects			2
we must understand that every antibiotic course has a biological cost , and more precisely align possible benefit with the full costs			2
i predict that in the future we will routinely be giving children back their lost microbes , in early life to restore their patrimony and after the antibiotic courses that are truly necessary			2
just as we have abused marvelous inventions like freon and the internal combustion engine , so too we have abused our " wonder drugs			0
" but the possible costs of these practices are our worst nightmare ; we need to prepare , starting now .			0

@entity285 : @entity286 of antibiotics put @entity0 at risk for disease
he says we wipe out good , protective germs , bringing danger of " antibiotic winter "
with lower resistance , plague inevitable in *interconnected* world , he says
@entity285 : targeted antibiotics , less *interference* in natural process are *key* to cutting vulnerability
