-- a family friend agreed to watch my dog @entity2 while i was on vacation			1
when i returned , he informed me that the name @entity6 seemed like a better fit , so that 's what he called her until the name stuck			1
i made a mental note to find reputable boarding facilities in my neighborhood , packed up @entity15 's things and left			2
even though i was upset at the time , changing my dog 's name back to @entity2 never occurred to me			1
perhaps that 's why i was slightly amused â € ” and a little baffled â € ” when @entity20 quarterback @entity19 celebrated his move to the @entity23 football team in the spring by changing his dog 's name from @entity25 to @entity26			1
sports writers flooded @entity28 with jokes about the move ( check out the hashtag # @entity31 ) , while some pet owners complained about the name change			2
but do dogs really know the difference ? each year , millions of cats and dogs are adopted from animal shelters or rescue groups			1
more often than not , those pets get new names to go with those new homes			0
" dogs do n't have a concept of identity the way we do , " says certified @entity45 dog trainer @entity44			1
" it might be confusing if you change [ the name ] regularly , but everyone i know calls their dogs several different nicknames			1
you can always add on ; you just want to have some consistency			0
it has to be something you consistently call them			0
" @entity0 : @entity65 animals with political ambitions certified dog trainer @entity67 adds that a name change can be good for pets , particularly if they were abused			1
consistent use of a new name helps them adjust to a new and different life			0
" it would be a good idea to change their name if they were rescued and were mistreated and that name is the name that was used , " says @entity67 , owner of k - 9 coach dog training and boarding facility in @entity77 , @entity78			2
" you do n't want them to have a negative association			0
it should be a new life , new owners , new name			2
" regardless of the situation , if you are planning a name change , here are a few tips to help you and your pet adjust			0
stay positive : dogs respond to your actions , not your words			1
when making a change , @entity44 recommends saying the new name in a happy and excited tone , preferably when there are few distractions			1
" when he looks at you , say ' good boy ! ' " @entity44 says			1
" you just want him to associate that word with looking at you			0
" @entity0 : 5 reasons why you should n't raise wild animals as pets turn over a new leaf : pairing recall training exercises , such as fetch , with a name change can help reinforce good behavior , says @entity67 , whose pack includes three dogs , one cat , a human child and a husband			2
" if i took my dog to the dog park and yelled ' @entity123 , @entity123 , @entity123 ' and the dog ignored me , and this has gone on for several years , we may suggest you change the name to associate a new behavior , " she says			2
make it a gradual transition : to help pets adjust and make the connection , @entity67 suggests using both names for about a week			0
" if you want to call her @entity132 and her name is @entity135 , say ' @entity136 , @entity136 ' for about a week , then drop the old name , " she says			0
if it rhymes with ' @entity139 , ' just say no : with all due respect to @entity142 dog @entity139 , avoid names that mimic the word no. that applies to names like @entity146 as well			2
" anything that sounds like a negative is something you want to avoid , " @entity67 says			0
" i 'm not a fan of names that sound like a correction			0
" need inspiration ? @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 rank high among the 485,000 pets insured by @entity160 insurance company			0
for the past two years , @entity155 has ranked no. 1 for dogs ; @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity156 round out the top five			0
for cats , the names @entity155 , @entity164 , @entity168 , @entity157 and @entity165 topped the list in 2011			0
based on @entity19 's performance next season , @entity26 just could make an appearance on the 2012 list			1
@entity0 : outdoor cats are prolific killers , study finds " you do n't want to change a dog 's name on a whim , " says @entity67			1
" i do n't know that @entity19 changing his dog 's name is the best idea , but once is not bad			1
" perhaps it 's time for @entity6 to drop a name that we both associate with less than stellar behavior			0
i can only hope that @entity2 does not enjoy eating my shoes			0
