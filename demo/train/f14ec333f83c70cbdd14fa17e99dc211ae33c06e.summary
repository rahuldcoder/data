-- " @entity1 " is a drill almost as old as football			2
several members of the team form a ring around a single player			0
the player in the middle begins a nervous shuffle , eyes darting , arms tense , as his teammates , one at a time , fling their bodies toward him at full force			0
he is the target of tackle after tackle , and if he moves too slowly the hits can be punishing			0
for many coaches , " bull in the ring " is an exercise in agility and mental fortitude			0
until recently , @entity28 , a youth football coach in @entity29 , @entity30 , did the drill with fifth - graders			1
" head to head , hammer to hammer , " is how @entity33 , president of the @entity34 , described players crashing into one another during the drill			1
" it 's really more about aggression , not technique			0
the old school of coaching football is that aggression			1
" when his team chalked up 20 concussions during the 2009 season , @entity33 decided that he needed to usher in " new school " coaching , focusing more on technique and less on aggression			1
one of the first steps was getting rid of " bull in the ring			0
" " the game 20 years ago is not the game today , so why not teach it differently , " said @entity33 , who has coached football for 15 years			1
" coaches , especially at the youth level , have to be open to that because we 're talking about kids			0
" @entity33 's revelation came after reading the book " @entity63 , @entity64 , " written by former @entity66 football player and @entity68 wrestler @entity65			1
@entity65 said that while aggression is endemic to football , there are ways to make the game safer			2
" can you ever make football so that no one gets hurt ? no. people are going to get hurt , " said @entity65 , president of the @entity77			0
" but you can eliminate certain drills , you modify certain drills , minimize certain drills ... eliminate dumb things like ' bull in the ring			0
' " @entity65 is a passionate advocate in part because concussions ended his wrestling career in 2004			0
ex-nfl stars after concussion : lives unraveled years later , when a mysterious , degenerative brain disease resembling dementia -- called chronic traumatic encephalopathy -- was described in athletes with repeated head trauma , @entity65 became a more outspoken advocate , especially for kids playing football			2
the first described cases of @entity100 were in deceased former @entity102 players , but recently the @entity103 for the @entity104 , which @entity65 co-founded , described @entity100 in the brain of an 18 - year - old athlete			2
" we have cases of teenagers , guys who never played pro sports , getting @entity100 and dying young , " said @entity65 , who added that dramatic changes are needed in football			0
concussion extra dangerous to teen brains " if we are n't talking about making relatively dramatic changes to the game in a public way ... then people are ok with kids getting a degenerative brain disease from playing football , " @entity65 said			1
@entity33 addressed the concussion issue in the @entity29 league by requiring preseason concussion education courses for all coaches , players and parents			1
he also reduced the amount of tackling during practice			0
" our kids hit maybe once or twice a week for short periods of time , " @entity33 said			1
" and in the beginning of the season , we go without helmets , moving through the mechanics of tackling and blocking because the brain 's smart , right ? as soon as kids see [ the head is ] going to get hurt , the head snaps back automatically			0
" practicing without helmets , @entity33 said , conditions kids to tackle with the head up instead of leading into tackles helmet - first , which is more likely to cause brain injury			1
he also has a certified athletic trainer attend all practices and games to evaluate players when a concussion is suspected			1
" if a kid came out [ of a game ] , he got a hard hit , what we used to call a ' stinger ' or a ' ding , ' we would simply ask ' are you ok ? ' and send him back in if he said yes , " @entity33 said			1
" now if we see a kid with a big hit , we 're checking on them to see if they 're ok , and we 're asking different kinds of questions to get the answers			0
" @entity33 said parents and coaches were resistant at first to the new rules			1
they were concerned about " weakening " the game			1
but most came around when they realized what was at stake for the children and , according to @entity33 , when the team continued to win			1
this past season , @entity33 's @entity177 made it to the league championship game and had 50 % fewer concussions			1
" the dramatic thing was that they were still good , " said @entity65 , who has conducted concussion safety presentations for parents and coaches in @entity29			1
" it did not hurt the kids ' ability to play the game			2
it just dramatically lowered their injury rate and their head trauma rate			0
" the new rules in @entity29 are part of a growing ( although sometimes grudging ) movement to make football safer for children -- whose brains are still developing and thus particularly susceptible to concussion			2
last year , the @entity201 of neurologists recommended immediately removing an athlete suspected of suffering a concussion from the game , not allowing players back on the field until they receive medical clearance , and having a certified trainer at every game			1
@entity211 : playing through concussion ' part of the game ' similar rules appear in the @entity217 law , passed in @entity218 in 2009			2
it is named after a 17 - year - old who suffered a devastating brain injury after returning to play too soon after a concussion			2
a handful of other states have passed similar legislation			0
while @entity65 is encouraged by the progress , he said that many youth football coaches continue to teach aggression			0
" you have to pose this question to people to get them to think about it : are you ok with destroying a kid 's brain for this game ? if you are , then let 's keep going exactly as we 've been going , " @entity65 said			2
" if you 're not , let 's really put our heads together with people who can actually make the changes and let 's do it			0
