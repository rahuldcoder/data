" the church needs " people who work with competence , precision and self sacrifice in the fulfillment of their daily duties , " he said			2
without professionalism , @entity1 warned , " there is a slow drift downwards towards mediocrity " and " dossiers become full of trite and lifeless information " that fail to inspire			2
without an attitude of service to bishops and churches worldwide , he said , " the structure of the @entity9 turns into a ponderous , bureaucratic customs house , constantly inspecting and questioning , hindering the working of the @entity42 and the growth of @entity45 's people			1
" holiness encompasses an openness to @entity45 , prayer , deep humility and fraternal charity in relationships with fellow workers , @entity1 said			0
" it also means apostleship , discreet and faithful pastoral service , zealously carried out in direct contact with @entity45 's people			0
for priests , this is indispensable , " he said			0
he also urged the @entity9 to avoid indulging in gossip , saying : " gossip is harmful to people , our work and our surroundings			1
" @entity1 has already taken a number of steps to try to reform the @entity12 's administration in the nine months since he was elected to the papacy			1
@entity0 's @entity12 reporter @entity69 , also a senior correspondent for the @entity71 , said saturday 's speech was brief but set out some core principles			2

the @entity10 has faced calls for reform in the wake of scandals involving the sexual abuse of children by priests and allegations of corruption			0
since taking charge , @entity1 has also shifted the tone of the church toward a focus on service , compassion and helping the poor and addressed controversial issues such as homosexuality and the role of women in the church			1
at his final general audience of 2013 in @entity113 on wednesday , the pope spoke about the birth of @entity115 and the importance of humility			0
" it is an ugly thing , " he said , " when you see a @entity121 who does n't want to humble himself , who does n't want to serve , a @entity121 who struts about everywhere : it 's ugly , eh ? that is not a @entity121 : that 's a pagan ! " in a measure of the impact he 's already had as pontiff , @entity1 was named as @entity131 's " @entity130 " this month			1
the @entity12 welcomed @entity131 's selection , while making it clear the man so widely recognized for his own humility did n't seek the award and did n't want its light to shine on him but on the mission of the church			2
