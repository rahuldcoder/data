@entity0 : what made you decide to enter the @entity3 competition ? @entity1 : my grandmother			1
@entity12 , 50 or 60 years ago , was very conservative			0
women had to stand behind men and never talk , never give an opinion -- and my grandma was different			2
i love her so much			0
she found out that there was @entity12 and that 's how everything started			0
she said , " @entity1 , you 're young , you can dance , you can teach dancing , you love it , it 's good -- but maybe you should see a different world			1
" and i said , ' ok ' and now i 'm here			0
@entity0 : what 's it like for you to be back in @entity29 ? @entity1 : it 's so nice to be back home			1
i can relax , i can sleep			0
this is my first vacation , i think -- just having fun with my family , my friends , and talking to my friend in a caf√©			2
that was my normal life before and since i became @entity3 it suddenly stopped			1
i always have to be in the mood , and i have to be @entity3 , so this is just perfect for me to be in my hometown of @entity29			1
@entity0 : how would you describe your relationship with @entity4 ? @entity1 : i love @entity4 , like i love @entity45 ; i love big cities			1
the first time i came to @entity4 was even before becoming a finalist for @entity12			1
also i was scared too , because people look so fashionable and people look so confident here and i was just a tourist from the countryside			0
people from all over the world come to see @entity4 , and so that 's why you can see very unique people here			1
people speak @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , and @entity63 ; there 's a very mixed culture here @entity0 : how would you define @entity66 ? @entity1 : i feel like people are so energetic here , so different from @entity29			1
people keep moving -- they never stop			2
@entity4 people are so busy all the time			1
i would n't say they are cold , they 're just busy ; they do n't have time to talk to others			0
i need a balance , i have to be in @entity29 for maybe 50 percent of the year and i have to be in @entity4 too , because i need this energy			2
@entity0 : how did you become a dancer ? @entity1 : i started to learn dance in mother 's dance school			2
my mom is my best friend , of course , my mother and teacher			0
so we have very unique relationship			0
we are not just mom and daughter , we 're also teacher and student			0
my mom teaches jazz dance , tap dance , modern dance , but she does n't teach ballet			0
i thought i should learn how to teach ballet , so i can have different class than she has			0
so i went to @entity97 when i was 16			0
i went to high school and professional ballet school in @entity97			0
it was very , very tough , but it was worth it now that i can teach ballet			0
now i want to teach young people , through dancing , how to be positive , patient and happy			1
these three things are very important to me			0
dancing means a lot to me , because dancing is my life , part of my life			0
i have been dancing for a long time -- maybe 17 years			2
dancing is great because this is how i express myself ; this is where i learned how to be confident			2
@entity0 : what was your mum 's reaction to you winning @entity3 ? @entity1 : she was very happy when i won @entity3 -- ' my daughter can travel the world and see people ' -- see the culture that she could n't			1
so she was very happy			0
@entity0 : outside dancing , what else do you enjoy ? @entity1 : i 'm a huge fan of baseball			1
baseball fans here in @entity12 are very supportive and crazy			0
they can go crazy too , but that 's a good part of @entity63 people -- if you like something , you 're very into it and support it			2
@entity0 : what else do you love about the city ? @entity1 : i think @entity4 is the best place to shop			1
@entity138 is a great place and i like the atmosphere too			1
when i became finalist for @entity12 , almost every week i went to @entity142 to shop			1
also , this is very close to @entity12 's office , so i was back and forwards to the office almost all the time			0
maybe you have heard about @entity149 girl ; there is a very famous street in @entity149 -- @entity152 - @entity153 -- and here you can find very crazy people , who dress up like dolls			2
there 's a very crazy , unique fashion code -- that 's why people like it .			2
