-- @entity2 ' return as @entity3 , @entity4 , topped the box office over the friday - to - sunday period , but with a weaker - than - expected $ 25 million			1
@entity8 's $ 92 million thriller , which also stars @entity9 , earned $ 8.2 million on thursday , its first day of release , and after four days , it 's earned $ 33.2 million			2
that 's a substantially weaker start than 2007 ′ s @entity12 , which started with $ 33.4 million in its opening three - day weekend			1
@entity14 's middling performance is n't a total surprise			2
this has been a remarkably tough winter for male - driven action vehicles , many of which star members of @entity21			2
@entity23 's $ 45 million entry @entity24 has earned just $ 12 million after five weekends			2
@entity27 's @entity26 , which reportedly cost $ 55 million , has only earned about $ 10 million after three			2
the @entity29 thriller @entity30 cost about $ 35 million but has only grossed $ 17 million after nearly a month in theaters			2
the @entity35 / @entity34 shoot - em - up @entity32 has languished with $ 19.5 million against a $ 35 million budget			2
( meanwhile , 2013 ′ s top four highest - grossing movies — identity thief , @entity39 , warm bodies , and @entity41 — all feature women in leading roles			0
) obviously , @entity4 has already earned more than each of those aforementioned flops , though , and it should n't be written off as a misfire			1
the film 's $ 7,036 per theater average from 3,553 theaters was strong , and with a " b + " cinemascore grade , it may benefit from word - of - mouth in the weeks to come			1
prognosticators certainly expected bigger business on opening weekend , and it remains to be seen whether it can match @entity12 's $ 134.5 million finish , but @entity8 can rest easy thanks to @entity14 's strong international performance so far			1
the film earned a tremendous $ 61.5 million overseas this weekend , bringing its international haul to $ 80.1 million and its worldwide cume to $ 113.4 million			1
those overseas results may keep @entity62 for years to come			0
last weekend 's champ , @entity64 , dipped only 32 percent to $ 23.4 million in its second weekend			1
the @entity67 / @entity66 laugher has now earned $ 70.7 million against a slim $ 35 million budget , and , for @entity69 , it 's the latest in a hot - streak of sensibly budgeted hits that almost ( almost ) make up for the fact that the studio spent $ 209 million on @entity73 , which earned only $ 65.4 million , last year			0
with the exception of @entity75 , every @entity69 film since the fall has been a profitable venture : @entity81 ( $ 65 million vs. $ 17 million budget ) , this is 40 ( $ 67.4 million vs. $ 35 million budget ) , @entity83 ( $ 145.5 million vs. $ 61 million budget ) , @entity39 ( $ 68.3 million vs. $ 15 million budget ) , and now identity thief			2
next up on the studio 's plate ? the surefire smash @entity90			0
close behind in third place , @entity93 's $ 28 million @entity92 adaptation @entity91 opened with $ 21.4 million			1
including @entity99 grosses , the goopy romance , which stars @entity96 and @entity97 , has earned a solid $ 30.5 million			0
relativity did a great job of marketing @entity91 as the top choice for @entity99 couples , and the built - in cachet of @entity92 continues to prove irresistible for many moviegoers			1
among all eight @entity108 films , @entity91 's $ 21.4 million frame trails the opening weekends of just @entity110 ( $ 30.5 million ) and @entity111 ( $ 22.5 million ) , which finished with $ 80 million and $ 60.5 million , respectively			1
for star @entity96 , who 's made the transition from @entity114 pro to fledgling country singer ( remember ? ) to @entity117 leading lady , @entity91 represents her best - ever opening weekend following underwhelming debuts from @entity120 ( $ 11.9 million ) , footloose ( $ 15.6 million ) , and @entity122 ( $ 14.6 million )			1
she may carve out an acting career , yet			0
like @entity14 , @entity91 missed with critics , but earned a " b + " cinemascore grade from audiences , which were 71 percent female and 68 percent below the age of 25			1
@entity130 's animated effort escape from @entity131 benefited from the fact that no family films have hit theaters in almost two months and finished in fourth place with $ 16.1 million			0
facing no family competition , @entity136 , which cost $ 40 million , fared better than @entity130 's last attempt to get into the animation game , hoodwinked too ! @entity140 , which bombed with just $ 10.1 million in april 2011			0
despite poor reviews , @entity141 wound up with a " b + " cinemascore grade			0
rounding out the @entity144 was @entity146 's @entity145 , which fell only 20 percent to $ 9 million , giving it a $ 50.2 million total			0
while the @entity151 adaptation has n't become the next @entity152 , positive word - of - mouth has helped @entity145 , which cost about $ 35 million , avoid the steep drops that usually plague films aimed at teens			0
it could finish with about $ 65 million			0
fellow @entity151 tale @entity157 did n't earn such a warm reception on its opening weekend			1
the witch - y tale bombed with only $ 7.5 million — $ 10 million including @entity99 grosses			0
@entity162 is distributing the film , which was financed for $ 60 million by @entity164			2
fortunately for the distributor , its other recent release , @entity165 , is on pace to pass $ 300 million at the domestic box office on monday			0
audiences issued @entity157 a lukewarm " b " cinemascore grade			1
@entity4 -- $ 25 million ( $ 33.2 million total ) 2			1
@entity91 -- $ 21.4 million ( $ 30.5 million total ) 3			1
identity thief -- $ 23.4 million ( $ 70.7 million total ) 4			0
escape from @entity131 -- $ 16.1 million ( $ 16.1 million total ) 5			0
warm bodies -- $ 9 million ( $ 50.2 million total ) 6			0
@entity157 -- $ 7.5 million ( $ 10 million total ) see the original story at @entity0			1
