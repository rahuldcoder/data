@entity0 -- even as secretary of state @entity2 said the ultimate goal for the @entity4 was to see @entity6 's president cede power , a senior administration official says the @entity10 - mandated no - fly zone and military action to support it would not necessarily last until @entity6 leader @entity12 steps down			1
this official , who spoke on background because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue , said that " right now , we 're focused on stopping the violence			1
" @entity19 said friday , " the first and overwhelming urgent action is to end the violence			2
and we have to see a clear set of decisions that are operationalized on the ground by @entity12 's forces to move physically a significant distance away from the east , where they have been pursuing their campaign against the opposition			1
" the purpose of the no - fly zone , the administration official said , is to prevent @entity12 from attacking his own people			1
" it 's not designed to have him go			2
that 's not the purpose , " the official said			2
" the purpose of the military action is to prevent massive humanitarian loss of life , to stop the violence			2
if the violence stops , then you should n't leap to say then the military action will continue until he leaves			0
" the ultimate aim of @entity4 policy , the administration official said , remains to force @entity12 step down			1
but to accomplish that , the administration 's strategy hinges on " sequencing			1
" " there are a lot of different measures , " the official said			0
" if you have a cease - fire in place that is verifiable , then you can continue turning the noose without taking necessarily further action			0
what we 're trying to do is freeze his advance			0
and then work from there to what was the original call , which was that he has lost legitimacy and he needs to go			0
but you have to sequence it			0
" the official conceded that there are many scenarios that could unfold : @entity12 could remove his forces , or he could temporarily cease attacking , only to later resume fighting			1
" that is exactly the crux of the matter			0
no one can define that			0
" but , this official says , the administration 's main approach now is : " keep the international community focused on this , and the result will be that he leaves , but that may take some time			1
" a top @entity90 official raised the concern that @entity12 could return to underwriting terror plots			1
" i think there is also a very real danger that if @entity12 is successful on the ground , that you will also face a number of other considerable risks as well , " undersecretary @entity93 said thursday			2
" the danger of him returning to terrorism , and violent extremism himself , the dangers of the turmoil that he could help create at a critical moment elsewhere in the region			0
" but a second @entity4 official said the intelligence community has been assessing the @entity6 leader 's capabilities and intentions			1
there is no indication that @entity12 will respond with a terrorist attack ; he is " distracted by events in his country , " but the official said " no one is discounting his brutality			2
" the official said it is unlikely @entity12 could orchestra a " sophisticated plot " such as the @entity124 or @entity126 disco bombings , but there is always the possibility of smaller - scale attacks			2
president @entity130 met friday with security officials and leaders of @entity133 , including rep. @entity134 , chairman of the @entity135			0
the @entity137 @entity136 said there was a consensus against putting @entity4 troops on @entity6 soil			1
" i think that is a terrible idea			0
it would be a terrible option , " said @entity134 , who supports the no - fly zone			0
" i ca n't foresee a circumstance that would require @entity4 soldiers on the ground in @entity6			1
" @entity134 said that protecting civilians and chemical weapon stockpiles are the top priorities			0
" this buffer zone is incredibly important to protect those people and other @entity6 who have stood up to @entity12 and said ' no more , we want freedom and self - rule , ' " the congressman said			1
@entity1 's @entity159 and @entity160 contributed to this report .			0
