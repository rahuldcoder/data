visited @entity3 to take a swing at repairing relations between @entity6 and the @entity7			1
as famed sportscaster @entity9 would have said , it was largely a swing and a miss. @entity1 struck out when he tried to equate today 's @entity7 with the party of @entity12 , while ignoring much of the 150 years in between			1
( he even acknowledged his mistakes shortly after )			0
but his willingness to step up to the plate can provide a lesson for a @entity7 struggling to get on top			2
republicans will not win black votes by paying lip service to party history while attacking social programs and voting rights			1
but they can make inroads by showing a commitment to civil rights , something @entity1 managed to do briefly in his remarks			1
@entity1 received applause when he told the @entity3 crowd , " we should not have drug laws or a court system that disproportionately punishes the black community			1
" he illustrated using one issue where the @entity7 can connect with black voters : criminal justice reform			1
just before the 2012 elections , the @entity37 took a nonpartisan survey of black voters in key swing states			0
we found that 55 % of @entity6 believe @entity7 " do n't care at all about civil rights " while another 32 % think the party " just says what minorities want to hear			1
" but 14 % said they would be more likely to vote for a @entity7 in the future , if they found a candidate who demonstrated a strong commitment to civil rights			1
mass incarceration is a fundamental civil rights issue			1
@entity6 make up 40 % of the 2.4 million people in @entity56 's bloated prison system			0
that includes the vast majority of those in prison for nonviolent drug offenses			0
if current trends continue , one in three black males born today can expect to spend time in prison during his life			0
as @entity1 demonstrated , mass incarceration is also a fundamental conservative issue			2
state spending on prisons has tripled over the last 30 years , reaching $ 70 billion in 2008			0
federal prisons are at 139 % capacity , often thanks to harsh mandatory minimum sentences			0
and who pays for all these guards , beds and three square meals a day ? taxpayers			0
in fact , some red states have led the way on criminal justice reform			1
in @entity87 , @entity85 and @entity86 , @entity7 legislatures have teamed up with progressives to increase options for parole and reduce mandatory minimums			2
in @entity86 , the @entity37 and progressive activists worked with leaders of the @entity94 to pass a dozen reform measures			0
last year , @entity86 scheduled the first prison closure in state history			0
@entity1 is not the first national @entity7 leader to speak up , either			1
@entity99 and @entity100 are both members of the conservative think tank @entity102			0
and in 2011 , @entity103 joined @entity104 and other unlikely allies - including @entity106 , the president of @entity108 's prison guard union -- to endorse the @entity37 's report , @entity110 : over @entity111 , @entity112			0
the report revealed how the rise in prison spending has caused states to spend less on education			2
these alliances should draw the attention of @entity7 leaders			2
many democrats shy away from talking about criminal justice reform , for fear of being labeled " soft on crime			1
" according to the @entity37 's election survey , 42 % of @entity6 voters believe the @entity127 is failing them on criminal justice			1
the @entity7 has a chance to fill the leadership vacuum and demonstrate their civil rights bona fides. @entity1 is poised to lead the conversation on criminal justice reform			1
at @entity3 he touted the " @entity135 of 2013 , " which he recently introduced with @entity137 chairman @entity136 , the @entity127 senator from @entity138			0
the bill would allow federal judges to bypass federal mandatory minimum sentences if the sentence is too lengthy or if it simply does not fit the crime			0
@entity1 told students that his friends called him " either brave or crazy " for showing up at @entity3 , a statement that says more about his friends than the audience at @entity3			2
nonetheless , @entity1 and his @entity7 would display true bravery , and political savvy , by taking this opportunity to walk @entity12 's walk and take on the new @entity153			1
moving from " tough on crime " to " smart on crime " would be good for this country			0
it would also be a smart move for the @entity7 if they ever hope to get on base with black voters			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			0

@entity163 : @entity1 's attempt to heal rift between blacks and @entity7 fell short
he says if @entity7 wants to draw black votes , it can start by committing to civil rights
one way is criminal justice reform , @entity163 says
@entity163 : sentencing reform , education would bring down spending . @entity7 , get on board
