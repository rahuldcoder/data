@entity0 , @entity1 -- as award - winning @entity6 film - maker @entity5 walked down the @entity0 red carpet for the premiere of his new feature thursday , the real star of the show was conspicuously absent			1
@entity6 filmmaker @entity5 , director of " @entity10 , " which was co-written by @entity12			1
@entity13 - @entity6 journalist @entity12 , credited as co-writer and executive producer of the faux - documentary " @entity10 , " was still in @entity6 , having been released from jail only days earlier			1
the woman @entity5 describes as his fianc√©e was freed from prison last monday after being jailed on espionage charges following a one - day trial that was closed to the public			2
she had served three and a half months , not all time served , of her eight year sentence and at one point was on hunger strike			2
" for four months , she was in prison			0
for me , four months is like four years , " @entity5 told @entity2			2
" in there , what did they do with her ? how did she live in there ? " " i could n't understand why the government sent her to prison , " he continued			0
" she is like an angel			0
she is really so clean			0
for example , if you ask me about my mum and her , i believe her first			0
" after much to - ing and fro - ing by the @entity6 authorities , @entity5 says he could n't believe it when he found out @entity12 had finally been freed , before the end of her sentence			1
" when [ i found out ] she was free ... i could n't understand , " the 40 year - old director told @entity2			0
he said it felt as if the the authorities were playing games with himself and other supporters of @entity12 as they gave different timescales for her release -- " two weeks , four years , eight years			0
" but just after the pair were reunited @entity5 -- who won @entity0 ' first - time film - maker award the @entity56 in 2000 with " @entity57 " -- had to leave for the @entity1 film festival			1
" @entity62 , " which chronicles the hardships facing young rock musicians as they seek to evade censorship from the authorities , had been selected to play in the @entity61 slot			0

@entity5 himself has already suffered at the hands of the @entity6 authorities			1
his 2008 film " @entity74 " was banned and says he was left feeling depressed and suicidal after spending three years unsuccessfully trying to get permission from the @entity6 authorities for another previous film			2
he thought about leaving @entity6 because he felt unable to work and cites @entity12 as the inspiration behind " @entity62 , " which was filmed in @entity79			1
shot illegally in just 17 days using a small , cheap digital camera -- the state owns all 35mm equipment in @entity6 , according to film industry trade magazine , @entity83 -- the faux - documentary chronicles the hardships facing two young musicians who are trying to put together a band			1
the story which combines comedy and tragedy to great dramatic effect showcases music and performances from real musicians who are part of the @entity79 underground music scene			1
it is estimated that there are 2,000 illegal bands in @entity79 , all practising and performing in a hidden world of hand - built recording studios in basements and rooftops around the city			0
@entity5 says that he feels some responsibility for @entity12 's time in prison because she stayed in @entity6 to help him with " @entity62 : " " she wanted to go back to the @entity13 [ @entity109 ] just stay for me and for my film and help for this film and give me the idea for the music			1
" @entity5 wrote an open letter in april this year calling for @entity12 's release when she was jailed after initially being arrested buying a bottle of wine , describing her as being caught in a " game of politics			1
" " my @entity6 girl with @entity121 eyes and an @entity13 id , is in jail			1
shame on me ! shame on us ! " he wrote of @entity12 , who has a @entity121 mother , in the letter			0
