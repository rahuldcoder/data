-- native son and veteran dog musher @entity1 of @entity4 , @entity5 , made history tuesday by claiming first place in the state 's famous @entity8			1
@entity1 's win marks the first time in the race 's 38 - year history in which an @entity5 @entity14 has taken top prize			1
@entity1 's win triggered some raw emotional @entity5 pride , with native drums beating loudly at @entity8 's finish line			1
@entity1 , wearing bib number 53 , pulled onto @entity21 in @entity22 at 9:46 a.m. local time , waving and shaking hands with the celebratory crowd as many fans ran behind @entity1 's sled			1
@entity1 , 48 , also shattered @entity28 's course record for fastest completion time , beating it by more than three hours			1
@entity1 completed more than 1,150 - miles of travel in eight days , 19 hours , 46 minutes and 49 seconds			2
the win marks @entity1 's 12th " @entity34 " finish , but , more importantly , his first win			1
the @entity8 's finish line in @entity22 is located along the @entity37 coast , in the heart of rural but proud @entity14 country , populated by the @entity40 that still relies on a traditional , subsistence lifestyle primarily of hunting , fishing and whaling			1
a large welcoming crowd gathered around the famed burled arch , and the crowd erupted in cheers and native chants as @entity1 and his team of 10 dogs became visible on the horizon			1
pumping his fists into the air , @entity1 told the crowd , " i feel good ... i 'm just so happy to be here and see everybody			2
i 'm just enjoying the moment ... this is the way life is supposed to be			0
" along with his lead dog seated on the winner 's podium of @entity8 39 , @entity1 was presented a check for $ 50,400 and a key to a brand - new @entity67 truck			1
the win epitomizes the pride running very deep in native @entity5			2
throughout race coverage provided online with " @entity71 , " @entity14 enthusiastically greeted @entity1 at checkpoints along the trail , providing words of encouragement to their native son			1
@entity77 , an elder from the village checkpoint of @entity79 , told the " @entity71 , " " this is a historic race , not just from the @entity8 perspective , but for the first time in the history of this race , a musher of @entity14 descent from western @entity5 is about to fulfill our ambitions for our customary and traditional livelihood			1
" @entity77 , who grew up mushing to collect wood to keep his family 's cabin warm , reminded race watchers , " this is not a sport			0
it used to be the only means of transportation			0
" @entity77 has been greeting mushers in @entity79 for decades now , but he admits @entity1 's position in the race inspired him for the first time to put on native clothing to greet the musher			1
the village elder donned his mom 's polar bear fur boots , his dad 's polar bear mittens , a parka with a wolf ruff and a beaver hat			0
he was beating on a traditional drum to welcome @entity1 's team into @entity79 before the sun had even risen , as seen on video provided online by " @entity71			2
" " i felt the spirit move me to welcome him into @entity14 country			0
i did that at 5 o'clock in the morning because i identify with him , " @entity77 told a reporter from the @entity121 , " we are so , so proud of him			0
" @entity126 , an elder from @entity1 's hometown , was watching as @entity1 crossed the finish line , telling " @entity71 " that @entity1 has " put @entity4 on the map			1
" @entity126 , whose son also was a musher in this year 's @entity8 race , says there is no day in @entity4 " that will be prouder than today			1
" @entity1 is a commercial pilot in his hometown and describes himself as self - employed			0
according to a biography featured in the 2011 @entity137 , @entity1 enjoys " rural @entity5 life " and lists his hobbies as " flying and dogs			2
" he has a son , @entity143 , 22 , a veteran of the @entity8 race and a daughter , @entity146 , 8 years old			0
@entity1 has been competing in the @entity8 consecutively since 1996 , one of the few natives who have successfully been able to raise the funds necessary to participate in the race each year			2
mushers estimate costs at close to $ 20,000 just to compete in the long - distance event -- including a $ 4,000 entrance fee , the year - long training of a dog team and the necessary supplies to be stocked all the way along the 1,150 - mile trail			0
many mushers compete with dog teams borrowed from other kennels to defray their own expenses			0
veteran musher @entity163 , who was racing in fifth place on the trail tuesday , told fans before the start of the race that he believes there should be a scholarship fund that would allow at least one native musher to compete each year in the @entity8			2
after all , the @entity8 's roots come from rural @entity5 traditions , which @entity163 says he studied first - hand while living and working in native villages across the @entity175			1
@entity163 knows a little something about how to scrape funds together			0
he moved to @entity5 in 1995 to " chase down a dream , " he told @entity0 , with only $ 200 to his name the first day			0
he was living in a tent in the woods near an @entity183 public park , he said , but now owns his own successful kennel in @entity185 , @entity5 , where he trains his long - distance teams			0
@entity163 was quick , however , to give most of the credit to the dogs themselves , declaring , " we , as humans , are so weak compared to these dogs			0
what they do blows my mind			0
half the time out there , i 'm either giggling or crying with joy just watching them do what they do ... it 's pretty phenomenal to watch			0
" @entity202 , a 23 - year - old third - generation musher from @entity204 , @entity5 , also was going for a top - five position in the race this year			2
@entity202 , the youngest musher to ever complete the @entity8 at age 19 , surprised veterans of the sport at this year 's 1,000 - mile @entity209 -- taking first place and a spot in history as the youngest musher to ever win that long - distance race			1
@entity202 began his @entity8 march from @entity183 to @entity22 only a couple weeks after the @entity209 win			2
last year 's champion and four - time consecutive @entity8 winner , @entity220 , had some early disappointments in the race this year			1
his starting team of 16 dogs has now been pared down to eight ; others were left with veterinarians at various checkpoints en route			0
@entity220 was in 17th place tuesday with about 100 miles still to travel to reach the finish line at @entity22			1
@entity1 and @entity220 are competitors in the race but are also good friends who share a common love for the sport			0
@entity220 acknowledged to " @entity71 " that having a new champion this year is " good for the sport			0
" @entity220 even predicted a native win by @entity1 would mean a lot to the state of @entity5			1
it could n't happen to a better guy , " @entity220 said			0
that congratulatory sentiment was echoed by @entity5 gov. @entity245 , whose office released a statement saying @entity1 's " lightning pace has given @entity4 bragging rights and made this a thrilling race for @entity5 and people around the world			2
