-- the company building the controversial @entity6 pipeline has submitted a proposal for a new route , a spokesman for @entity3 's environmental authority said wednesday			2
the new route is east of the initially proposed route that went over an environmentally sensitive aquifer , said spokesman @entity11 of the @entity12 of @entity13			1
@entity14 is the company constructing @entity6			0
the pipeline is intended to carry between 500,000 and 700,000 barrels of crude oil a day from @entity19 's oil sands to the @entity21 @entity20			1
@entity21 president @entity22 in january denied a permit for the 1,700 - mile pipeline , a decision that prompted @entity27 criticism that the president was not doing everything possible to create jobs and combat high gasoline prices			1
@entity22 defends policy on pipeline supporters , including the oil industry , also say the pipeline would lessen the country 's dependence on oil imported from volatile regions			2
opponents , including environmentalists , say the pipeline might leak and that it would lock the @entity21 into a particularly dirty form of crude that might ultimately end up being exported			2
" with this new route submitted and the state of @entity3 acting to move forward , the president is running out of excuses for blocking the @entity6 pipeline any longer , " house speaker @entity46 , @entity47 , told @entity0			1
" with a veto - proof majority in the @entity53 supporting @entity6 , the president is becoming increasingly isolated in his opposition to this job - creating energy project			0
he should listen to the voices of the @entity21 people and unlock the project so we can get @entity21 working and address high gas prices			2
" @entity22 announced in march that he would approve a portion of the pipeline , a part that runs from @entity64 , @entity65 -- a key repository of @entity21 oil -- to the @entity20			1
he had said he was always in favor of permitting that portion , even when he blocked the full project			0
@entity71 announces settlement over 2010 spill the other portion of the pipeline had stirred concerns of @entity77 worried about underground water supplies			2
an aquifer in @entity3 provides drinking water for much of the state			0
they fear a pipeline burst would allow oil to seep into the @entity85 , a massive water table beneath the @entity87 and one of the largest in the world			0
the aquifer provides drinking water for much of the state and is important for @entity3 's agricultural economy			0
the previous route of the @entity6 pipeline would have crossed the @entity21 border in @entity96 , shortcutting an existing pipe that enters the @entity21 in @entity98			1
currently , there are not enough pipelines to take the oil being produced in @entity19 and @entity98 to refineries and terminals on the @entity20			1
that means @entity106 refineries can pay lower prices to get it			0
giving the @entity19 oil easier access to the @entity20 means the glut in the @entity106 goes away , making it more expensive for the region , but it would increase the amount of that oil available to global markets			1
the @entity53 on wednesday approved a @entity27 bill that aims to fast - track the @entity6 project as part of another 90 - day extension of federal transportation funding			0
the 293 - 127 vote allows @entity46 to begin negotiations with @entity123 over a longer - term funding measure for road , rail and bridge projects .			0

new : " the president is running out excuses " to block pipeline , @entity46 says
the route is east of the one initially proposed , a state spokesman says
the pipeline is intended to carry crude oil from @entity19 to the @entity21 @entity20
@entity21 president @entity22 had approved a portion of the previous route
