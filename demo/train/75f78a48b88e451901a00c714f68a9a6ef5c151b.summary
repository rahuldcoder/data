-- november 30 , 2009 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : you are in the homestretch -- just a few weeks left to go before the holiday break			2
and we 'll help get you there			2
i 'm @entity23 ; this is @entity0			2
first up : troops in @entity4 @entity26 : big announcement scheduled for tomorrow night : what president @entity28 plans to do about @entity4			2
there are 68,000 @entity32 troops there right now			2
and you know the president 's been meeting with advisors for weeks , trying to figure out how the @entity32 should approach the war there			1
he says he wants to get the decision right , but he 's been criticized for taking too much time to make it			1
there is one thing that some critics and supporters of the president seem to agree on , though : that he needs to talk about the @entity32 mission in @entity4			2
sen. @entity45 , ( r ) , @entity46 : the president needs to start by outlining the war we are in			2
now by that , i mean , the war not against the @entity53 , @entity54 , but what is , at least , the objective of continuing in @entity4 or in any place ? that is basic			2
sen. @entity59 , ( @entity60 ) , @entity61 : the president has to speak to the @entity32 people , remind them why we 're there , and also lay out a strategy , not just the reflexive response to a recommendation , but a strategy that involves protecting the homeland from @entity54			2
cyber monday @entity26 : good news and bad news about @entity74 , that super shop - off right after @entity75			1
more @entity32 showed up in stores than last year -- good for business			2
but they were spending less money on average -- not good for business			2
still , online sales were on the up and up this year , and that could be a good sign heading into @entity85 , explained now by @entity86			1
( begin video ) @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 : over the past decade @entity85 has become one of the biggest online shopping days of the year			1
we typically see this on the monday following @entity75 or in the days leading up to @entity95			2
huge spikes in online retail sales			2
people want to avoid those long lines in - store so they head online to snap up some of the bargains			0
so exactly how much are people spending ? well take a look at the numbers here			0
after last year 's financial collapse , $ 536 million was spent online in the @entity32 on the friday after @entity75			1
on the following monday , you see it there , online sales swelled to $ 846 million and this year 's numbers , they 're still coming in , but you can expect them to go higher			1
you see , even though a 1 % drop in overall retail sales are predicted this year , @entity110 expects a 3 % rise in online retail revenue for the months of november and december			0
that 's over last year , which should amount to almost $ 29 billion of retail sales			1
now that 's good news , but it 's not great news			1
typically we see at least a 20 % jump for holiday retail sales			0
from the @entity126 in @entity90 , i 'm @entity86			0
( @entity127 ) @entity128 time for the shoutout ! you 're looking at a map of @entity132			0
which of these countries is @entity5 ? is it a , @entity136 , c or @entity138 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity5 is between @entity139 and @entity140 , and it touches both the @entity141 and the @entity142			0
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity146 @entity26 : sunday 's vote was no ordinary election in @entity5			1
things there , still at a political standstill , months after president @entity149 was forced out of office in june			0
he was accused of trying to illegally change @entity5 ' constitution			0
the country 's @entity155 says @entity149 ca n't get power back until he stands trial			1
but @entity5 ' current leader , @entity159 , is hoping sunday 's vote will settle everything			1
the @entity32 also hopes it does ; @entity161 and @entity162 say it wo n't			0
defying demands @entity26 : @entity164 is doing exactly what other countries do n't want it to			0
the @entity169 nation is moving forward on building ten , new , nuclear facilities			0
and the international community is afraid these things are gon na be used to make illegal , nuclear weapons			0
@entity164 argues they 're only for nuclear power -- the @entity164 cabinet voting to approve construction just two days after the @entity178 demanded that @entity164 stop working on another nuclear facility that it had kept secret			0
@entity182 @entity26 : @entity6 : part of the @entity7 : known for some of the most extravagant communities on the planet , could be in trouble			1
a major developer there is in deep debt and wants more time to pay it off			1
and some are wondering if some lavish property could become a white elephant , something that 's more trouble than it 's worth for @entity6			1
@entity197 describes how all this could affect places far from the @entity169			0
( begin video ) @entity201 , @entity89 , @entity6 : the party to open @entity6 's @entity203 just over a year ago now seems like a mirage			1
at an estimated cost of $ 20 million it boasted a guest list of the world 's rich and famous			1
just two months after the @entity211 shock , the dazzling extravagance seemed to say @entity6 is immune , but it never was			0
@entity212 , which owns @entity213 , the developer of the man - made tree - shaped @entity215 , has now requested a suspension of debt payments			1
the move threatens to undermine confidence in a recent property recovery , and celebrities who bought homes there may find their property is suddenly worth a lot less			0
author @entity228 says that while established developments should be fine , @entity6 's other artificial island projects , @entity230 and @entity231 , could be in trouble			1
@entity234 , author , " @entity236 " : it will take a special kind of investor and probably , you know , more robust economy for anybody to really build on one of those places			0
i mean there is a lot more practical places to build than on one of these little islands in the world , so that could be a white elephant for a long time			0
@entity253 : one of the firms , which has bought into the @entity255 , has confidence in @entity6 's long - term story			1
@entity258 , select property : i would disagree that it would be a white elephant			0
i think it will be part of the continuing development of @entity6 as a city , and a tourism center , and an investment center for many years to come			0
@entity253 : but in the short term , @entity212 's announcement has brought uncertainty and the prospect of a fire sale of assets to raise cash			1
whatever the fate of investments abroad , hopes that @entity6 's inflated portfolio of luxury property was beginning to recover have been dashed			1
@entity197 , @entity0 , @entity278			0
( @entity127 ) shoutout @entity279 time for a @entity280 ! what does the @entity282 word " @entity283 " mean ? is it : a ) @entity286 or @entity60 ) christmas tree another three seconds -- go ! @entity283 means christmas tree -- and the tradition of the modern christmas tree comes from @entity291 too ! that 's your answer and that 's your @entity280 ! @entity296 @entity26 : a band was reportedly playing " @entity300 , " or " oh , @entity301 " when the first family had their own tree delivered over the weekend			1

@entity334 : what we really like this year is that it 's going to a family			1
the family is well knit			0
@entity323 : to provide the @entity333 tree , a farmer has to be crowned by the @entity343			1
then @entity333 officials make a visit			1
@entity346 : they 're looking for trees that have good form and for trees that have stronger branches because they use a lot of decorations			0
@entity323 : and it takes a lot of hard work to grow that perfect presidential tree			1
careful pruning , experimenting to get the right mix of characteristics , and a little tough love			0

@entity323 : these college sweethearts who have been growing trees for 50 years are hoping to shake the @entity28 's hands when they drop off this holiday gift but then it 's back to work			1

more than 120 students teamed up to devour over 600 donuts , roughly five donuts per student , all to help raise money for those less fortunate			2
the girl who ate the most said the cause made it worth it , even if she felt like barfing			0
