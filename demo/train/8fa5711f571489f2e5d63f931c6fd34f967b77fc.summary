" a year later , they 're in love			1
" the first time people meet you , they want to hear the sensational part " of the crash , says @entity5 , 39			1
he prefers to talk about something different : " i met this wonderful girl because of what we went through that day			1
" @entity3 , 31 , looks at him , batting her model - like lashes , and smiles			1
" we do n't dwell on what happened to us in the crash , " she says			1
" it 's more so on the experiences and lessons that we 've taken from it			2
" ' is this really happening ? ' a buyer for @entity35 department stores , @entity3 was in @entity36 for the fashion market			1
with the nation in the thick of recession , she scooped up bargains for herself			2
she carried her trendy purchases through the airport that day on her return home to @entity0 , @entity1			2
wearing a sweater dress , tights and boots , the woman with stylish sandy brown curls was getting a bite to eat when a group of guys asked if she was a model			2
" no , " she said			2
" but i am in the fashion industry			2
" she was traveling with five @entity35 co-workers			2
waiting to board , she fired off e-mails and thought little of the flight home or those around her			1
@entity5 -- who was in @entity36 for a quick business trip for @entity61 -- caught a glimpse of the 5 - foot , 10 - inch knockout near the gate			1
later , when they boarded , he noticed her again , coming down the aisle			2
" the first thought i had was it 'll be cool if she sits beside me			2
" he was in @entity70 , a window seat on the left side of the plane			1
she sat down three rows in front of him , in @entity76 , on the aisle			2
it was one of those fleeting moments every single person knows : you see an intriguing stranger , hope for the best , then move on			1
@entity5 picked up a book and began reading			1
@entity3 , who did n't notice @entity5 , thumbed through a @entity85 magazine			1
at the helm of the @entity87 was @entity88 , a 57 - year - old former @entity89 fighter jet pilot			2
he 'd been flying for four decades , for @entity90 since 1980			2
his expertise was about to mean everything			2

some passengers described hearing a series of loud thumps			2
" one lady screamed , " @entity5 recalls			1
he looked out the window			2
" the whole back of the engine was pretty much engulfed in flames , just shooting out of the back , " he says			2
he thought : " this is n't good			0
" the plane banked to the left			1
the smell of burning geese , feathers and flames wafted through the cabin			0
with neither engine working , a silence fell over the jet as it glided through the skies			0
some thought they were going back to @entity122			0
@entity88 came over the speaker system			0
" brace for impact , " he said			0
" the most harrowing thing i 'd ever heard in my life , " @entity5 recalls			1
" i thought for a second : is this really it ? am i going to die ? " three rows in front of him , @entity3 thought about calling her family			1
if i die , what a depressing message that would be to leave on a message machine , she thought			0
and what would she say if they did answer ? " guess what ? in 60 seconds , you 're not going to be talking to me any more			0
" she crouched down , prepared for impact			0
" is this really happening ? " fear of birds and drowning @entity3 grew up on a farm in @entity148 and had lived in @entity149 , for the past 12 years			1
she 'd jumped at the chance to take on a bigger role with @entity35 in @entity0			0
but her focus on career meant there was n't much time for relationships while jet - setting around for work			0
@entity5 was a @entity1 native , and he also poured his energy into work			1
the software developer at @entity61 was divorced with no children			0

as she got older , her disdain for birds grew			0
when she traveled to @entity36 on business , the abundance of pigeons sometimes terrified her			0
@entity5 's fear -- of drowning -- went back to an experience he had when he was 8			1
on a beach outing with his family , his raft drifted out from shore and then flipped over			0
he scrambled to try to get back on , but kept falling back into the sea			0

' we connected ' as the plane glided silently through the air , @entity5 peeked out the window every once in a while			1

" just make it quick so i do n't have to suffer , " he thought			0
the @entity87 splashed into the frigid waters of the @entity13			0

@entity201 lapped at @entity3 's leather boots			1
she grabbed her wallet and her cell phone with a gps tracking device			0
it 'll be easier for rescuers to find my body and identify me , she thought			0
she exited to the left and onto a wing			0
while bobbing up and down there , she called her father			0
" @entity215 , this is @entity3			1
i 've been in a plane crash			1
" when things calmed down and she knew she would be rescued , she found comic relief in what brought the plane down			2
" you do realize my fear of birds is justified , " she told her parents			0
" ok , we 'll give you that one , " they responded			0
inside the plane , a bottleneck of passengers blocked some exits			2
a flight attendant in first class waved passengers to the front			2
@entity5 climbed over the seats			1
at the door , he looked out and saw water all around			0
clutching tight to his seat cushion , he jumped into a raft			0
with survivors packed in like sardines , he worried the raft might tip. later , safe on shore , @entity5 's colleagues who were also on the flight saluted life and told him : you know what we 'd be doing tonight if we were single ! @entity5 thought about the woman with the long legs and curly hair			1
he wondered what happened to her			0
from @entity254 friends to dating a bottle of @entity257 bourbon helped ease @entity5 's charter flight home to @entity0 that night			1
in the media blitz that followed , @entity3 noticed @entity5 for the first time on television			1
flight 1549 survivors -- whose stories were compiled in the book " @entity9 , " published late last year -- formed support groups			1
they considered " @entity88 " their hero , each other family			0

" we connected , " @entity3 says			1
they took it slow at first			0
neither was looking for a relationship			0
" we were family , " @entity5 says , " and we did n't want to ruin that aspect of it			1
" eventually , sparks lit. despite their bond , the last year has had its difficulties			0
they wonder why they survived when , a month later , all 50 people aboard a @entity301 commuter jet died			1

four other boxes of returned items sit unopened in a spare bedroom			0
she does n't know whether to throw them out or save them			0
" things in there must not be that important , " she says			0
" all the priorities were reset after january 15			1
" her relationship with @entity5 , she says , is another " positive outcome " from that day			1
" we kind of pick each other up if we start to slip , " @entity5 says			1
" what 's better than smiling and laughing and love ? " they 're speaking about their relationship , @entity3 says , because too much news dwells on the negative			1
their message is the opposite			0
" think about how you want to write today 's page , " @entity5 says			1
" live , laugh , love and dance like tomorrow 's not guaranteed			1
