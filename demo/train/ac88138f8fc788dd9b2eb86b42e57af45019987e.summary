you should avoid areas of demonstrations , and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings , protests , or demonstrations , " the embassy said			2
" be alert and aware of your surroundings and pay attention to local news media reports			0
" the unrest came as demonstrators hoped to force prime minister @entity48 from office			1
in a bid to cool tensions , the prime minister dissolved the nation 's parliament this month and called for new elections , to be held february 2			1
but the move has done little to appease protesters , who remained on the streets			0
