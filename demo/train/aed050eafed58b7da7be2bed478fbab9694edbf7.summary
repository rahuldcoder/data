@entity0 , @entity1 -- the forthcoming @entity4 profile of gen. @entity5 that was leaked to the press monday has now taken on a life of its own			1
" @entity15 , " by former @entity17 correspondent @entity16 , offers a very close look at the four - star general who commands @entity12 and @entity13 forces in @entity14			1
the piece is available in digital format to anyone who wants to read it ahead of its scheduled publication			1
some very smart writers , bloggers and tweeters have been dissecting it now for the better part of a full day , critical of the attitudes and behaviors described in it as examples of arrogance , vindictiveness , frustration , or just plain old poor judgment			0
this is n't the first time @entity5 has been profiled in the media			1
when he first took charge of the @entity14 mission in the summer of 2009 , he was heralded for his past achievements as a @entity44 officer and his approach to getting things done in both @entity47 and @entity14			0
his personal asceticism was a source of awe : sleeping four hours a night , running 15 kilometers and eating a single meal per day , all while directing an extremely difficult mission			0
he was , by all accounts , the right man for the right job , and could be trusted to sift through the mess , defeat the enemy , and bring the troops home			0
his conduct has generally been correct and professional , too , despite significant differences of political and military opinion on @entity12 's @entity14 policy			0
that was at the beginning of his tour			0
now , after almost a year , he appears to have either deliberately let his guard down or been caught with his pants around his ankles			0
@entity16 , who spent a month with @entity5 , writes that he is " determined to put his personal stamp on @entity14 , to use it as a laboratory for a controversial military strategy known as counterinsurgency			1
" he also describes @entity5 's entourage as a " handpicked collection of killers , spies , geniuses , patriots , political operators and outright maniacs			1
" to those who have been following the issues , these read like the awkward , breathless observations of an ing√©nue -- or like material packaged to sell to an audience more attuned to music and pop culture than war and foreign policy			0
what 's really got everyone 's attention , though , is the article 's candid descriptions of what appears to be the @entity101 's ( " @entity102 " ) contempt for its civilian counterparts and masters , including president @entity105 , vice president @entity106 , @entity12 ambassador to @entity14 @entity108 and special envoy @entity109			1
@entity5 issued a formal apology tuesday , just ahead of the viral stream that propelled the article across the web			1
observers are critical that it may not be enough			0
@entity116 has now recalled @entity5 to explain himself , and @entity117 , the civilian press aide who arranged @entity16 ' access , has reportedly resigned his post			1
as the bodies begin to fall , some are pessimistic about what the future holds for @entity5 , and whether , by this time wednesday , he will still be in command of @entity12 and @entity13 forces in @entity14			1
the article raises as many questions about its author as it does about the command culture surrounding @entity5			1
it is difficult to fathom that any reporter would be granted warts - and - all access to the inner sanctum , with no strings attached			2
were there any ? it is equally hard to understand how members of @entity102 could feel free to speak as unguardedly as they did -- much less cut loose under the influence of alcohol , as @entity16 described it -- and expect a good journalist in their midst to not record his observations			0
in an interview with @entity2 on tuesday , @entity4 executive editor @entity145 contended the comments made by @entity5 and other top military aides during the interview were " not off - the - cuff remarks , " he said			1
they " knew what they were doing when they granted the access			0
" the story shows " a deep division " and " war within the administration " over strategy in @entity14			0
mostly , it 's difficult to discern what it is @entity16 was trying to accomplish with the article , which feels like it wants to be two separate things : a balanced and in - depth profile , or an out - and - out hatchet job			2
on the former , it fails to convince -- the author 's grasp of context is uneven , at best			1
on the latter , his collected quips are hardly worth the gasps and tisks they 've earned thus far , and do n't lend themselves well to the context he 's trying to convey			1
@entity16 , a young reporter whose work has been published in a variety of reputable publications , including the @entity183 , the @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 , was a @entity17 correspondent in @entity47 from 2005 to 2007			2
his girlfriend , @entity187 , another young journalist , followed him there ; she was killed in a @entity190 militia ambush in january 2007			0
his memoir of the experience , " @entity193 in @entity194 : a @entity199 " , was published in 2008 , and quickly panned by @entity196 staff writer @entity195 in a review in the @entity198			2
it was " really two books " that failed to reconcile the war story and their romance			2
it had an " embarrassing title			0
" it carried a " whiff of exploitation , " and it suffered from " literary shortcomings			0
" more to the point , @entity195 is one of several journalists , along with the @entity183 's @entity213 and @entity214 of the @entity198 ( among others ) to have written notable accounts of their time reporting from @entity47			2
some , like @entity214 ' book " @entity219 , " are more intensely personal than others ; the better volumes convey , in one way or another , the sense of social distance that separates their authors from the subjects they write about and from the world outside			0
that 's not what @entity230 does			0
he can , according to @entity195 , " convey the deadly ennui of a foot patrol " but " is unable to rise rhetorically to the tragedy " of his girlfriend 's death			0
substitute a few details , and that becomes a remarkably apt description of the @entity243 piece			2
@entity16 clearly demonstrates a keen eye for off - color detail , but fails to weave the threads into something more coherent or meaningful			1
getting the facts straight and reporting them is one thing ; knowing your subject and making sense of it is quite another			2
that 's important , and something the @entity255 should keep in mind before making a decision on the basis of a single reporter 's work			2
if @entity5 is to be sacked , it should be because the @entity262 thinks the relationship between its military and civilian elements in @entity14 is important to the mission and needs fixing , or because it wants to shift directions in @entity14 and a change of military leadership would be the best way to make it happen			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity273 .			1

an article entitled " @entity15 " puts gen. @entity5 under *scrutiny*
@entity273 says president @entity105 should n't fire @entity5 based on this one article
he says the piece fails to put comments by @entity5 and his staff in context
@entity273 says reporter failed to weave threads of his reporting into a more coherent whole
