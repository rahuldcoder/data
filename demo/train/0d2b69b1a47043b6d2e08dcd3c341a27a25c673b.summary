-- after seven years of planning and construction costing over $ 150 million , @entity2 's dream to open a golf course in @entity4 was finally realized on tuesday			1
the @entity8 - based billionaire hit the ceremonial first tee shot at @entity10 , having weathered a storm of controversy involving environmentalists , local residents and politicians			0
" it 's been worth it , " he told @entity0 during his rain and wind - swept round at the venue			2
" this is truly the greatest golf course anywhere in the world			0
most people are saying it and most of the golf people are saying it , most importantly			0
" @entity2 welcomed guests from the @entity30 and the @entity32 organizing committee , and told them : " there 's really nothing like it			1
" set on the east coast of @entity4 , eight miles north of the city of @entity39 , the course occupies part of the private @entity41 , bought by @entity2 in 2006			1
the opening of the championship course is the first step towards the @entity8 tycoon 's goal of creating a resort featuring a second golf course , a hotel , luxury holiday homes and a residential village			2
@entity2 expects the total bill for the development to exceed a billion dollars , although the next stage of building is currently on hold while he contests plans to build an offshore wind farm nearby			2
rarely has a new golf course had such criticism and hype			0
accusations of bullying from local residents and objections from environmental groups were documented in the movie " you 've been trumped , " while sport writers have been thrilled at every new photo revealing the dramatic holes			1
the sheer amount of money pumped into the project enabled @entity76 golf architect @entity75 to manipulate the land on an unprecedented scale			0
" this is one of the most extraordinary golf links sites you have seen or will ever see , " @entity75 said at the opening ceremony			0
" there is no doubt in my mind it will be in the top three in the world			0
i just do n't know who 'll be number two or three ! " before the opening , @entity90 announced that the course has gone straight into its @entity94 course rankings at number eight , ahead of several @entity97 venues including @entity98 , which will host the golf season 's third major tournament next week			1
@entity2 's ultimate goal is to bring a major tournament to his latest course , and the @entity30 chief executive @entity104 hinted that it may not be far away			1
" great courses need great tournaments , " said @entity104 , " we will work with mr. @entity2 to bring the right event here			2
" @entity108 of the @entity109 and @entity111 @entity110 made the only reference to the saga of controversy and criticism around the course 's planning : " @entity90 is a responsible business			1
i wish the environmentalists would embrace golf , " he said			0
on the course , @entity2 was joined by one of the @entity30 's most successful players , @entity124 , who described the course as " dramatic and spectacular			1
" on the question of whether @entity10 will ever host the @entity97 or a @entity32 event , the @entity4 golfer was optimistic			0
" there 's no doubt that tournament golf will come here , " the 49 - year - old former @entity131 @entity32 captain said			0
" it 's a fantastic opportunity for people locally , nationally and internationally to come to this area			0
" @entity2 championed his @entity4 family ties throughout the planning process , and continued the theme at the opening ceremony as he gave out whiskey and shortbread to invited guests			1
the tale of how an @entity8 billionaire 's dream became reality across the pond has made @entity90 links one of the hottest tickets of the summer , with tee times already in short supply			2
the course opens to the public on sunday , with green fees costing $ 310 on a weekend or $ 233 on a weekday , the same price as the summer rate on the prestigious @entity160 at @entity161 , known as " the home of golf			1

@entity2 's @entity4 golf course cost $ 150 million to create
its creation was *hugely* *unpopular* with locals and environmental groups
@entity90 *magazine* has already ranked the course as the eighth best in @entity109
it opens to the public this sunday and green fees will be same as a round at @entity161
