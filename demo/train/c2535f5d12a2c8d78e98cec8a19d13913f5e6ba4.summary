they believe that @entity7 's regime is trying to discredit her as a woman who has been raped and -- as some people in conservative @entity60 societies believe -- therefore dishonored			1

" he refused to take further questions on the issue , repeatedly stating that @entity1 society is " very conservative			0
" a group of lawyers and human rights activists tried to approach @entity25 's sister 's house monday , but were blocked by security forces			1

@entity17 said she was also concerned for the safety of her other daughter			2

she showed reporters blood on her right inner thigh			0

" look at what @entity7 's brigades did to me , " she said			1
" my honor was violated by them			0
" @entity18 displayed what appeared to be visible rope burns on her wrists and ankles			0
government officials tried to stifle her , but she persisted			0
