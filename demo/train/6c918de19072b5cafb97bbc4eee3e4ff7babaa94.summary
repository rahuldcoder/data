-- this is how the world ends -- at least at the multiplex this month			1
last weekend 's box - office champ " 2012 " primarily uses an ancient @entity6 prophecy to spin a tale of world destruction			1
" @entity14 , " due out november 25 , showcases a father and son navigating a post-apocalyptic world of ash , cold and cannibals			1
and the indie documentary " collapse " gives voice to one man 's belief that , as we exhaust natural resources , civilization is ready to crumble			2
such concerns have always been with us , says @entity25 , a sociology professor at @entity26 who 's incorporated eschatology ( the study of the end times ) into his courses			1
" it 's been a constant part of the landscape in the western world for a long time , " he says , though it 's been particularly present in recent times , perhaps driven by ever - quickening social and technological change , he adds			1
examples can be found through the centuries			2
at the end of the year 999 , pilgrims made their way to @entity43 , convinced that the last judgment was at hand			1
in 1843 , thousands of followers of the religious leader @entity47 gathered on @entity49 hilltops , waiting for ascension			2
in 1982 , some believed the " @entity53 " -- the rough alignment of several celestial bodies -- would cause catastrophe			2
and the coming of the year 2000 led to fears about technological collapse -- in the form of the @entity59 -- and rumblings about the return of @entity62			1
the fact that none of these events led to the @entity66 has n't calmed end - times fears			1
indeed , many people are still trying to interpret alleged prophecies -- such as the biblical @entity70 , @entity72 ' verses and that 2012 - focused @entity73 -- in hopes of figuring out exactly when the other shoe will drop , and humanity will be freed from its vale of tears			1
@entity25 observes that end - times passions find particularly fertile soil in the @entity81 , which has a higher degree of religiosity compared to other developed nations , according to a 2008 @entity86 survey			1
at the evangelical @entity87 in @entity88 , @entity89 -- one of the largest @entity92 churches in the world -- @entity94 , the church 's teaching pastor , gives a yearly series of lectures on end - times concepts and says interest has been high , with " lines out the door			1
" he says that he tries to educate his audience about the sources of apocalyptic thought , and why biblical prophecy is such a draw for some			0
" biblical prophecy lays out a scenario that @entity110 says this is what 's going to happen , and just watch for these signs , " he says			0
the movie business has taken notice : the @entity116 , producers of " @entity14 , " asked @entity94 to take his show on , well , the road to discuss themes of the film			0
but it 's not just @entity123 groups that have an end - times fascination			1
@entity25 says that all the major monotheistic faiths -- @entity126 , @entity123 and @entity127 -- have variations on the belief that @entity110 interacts directly with humanity , and has made a promise " to wrap things up , and then we 'll get on with @entity133			0
" that idea of an @entity135 -- or , better yet , a conclusion -- satisfies something innate in humans , he says			0
" lots of people have an interest in cultural narratives ... that have a closure that coincides to some degree with their own lives , " @entity25 says			1
science provides a story as well , he says , " but it 's very open - ended			2
" the eschatological narrative , on the other hand , says " the world is going to come to an end , and it 's likely going to come to an end in my lifetime			1
so conveniently , everything is going to wrap up when or before my life wraps up			0
" which is where @entity161 , longtime manufacturer of great stories and seeker of customer satisfaction , comes in			0
ireporter : see " 2012 " in theatres movie history is replete with end - of - the - world scenarios , whether driven by religion ( " @entity172 " ) , alien invasion ( " @entity174 ! " ) , environmental disaster ( " @entity176 " ) , warfare ( " @entity178 " ) or much of the above ( " beneath the @entity179 " )			1
@entity180 , @entity181 at the @entity182 , points out that the topic is almost as old as film itself : the first sound film of @entity187 , who made the groundbreaking 1927 silent " @entity189 , " was 1931 's " @entity190 , " in which a comet slams into @entity192			0
) such films allow us to enjoy the present while watching a fantasy about the future , he says			2
" i think it 's a desire to sort of say ... ' we wo n't have to worry about the future , because there is no future , ' " he says			0
" and so therefore , we can do what we want now , and all the debts are put off and all the responsibilities are avoided			0
" besides , " the complete destruction of the world has always been attractive , because ... by witnessing that act and staying outside of it , you 've witnessed the apocalypse , " he says			2
" it 's much like a horror movie			0
it allows you to participate without risk			0
" " we love adrenaline , " adds @entity218 , a writer - producer of documentaries for the @entity220 and the @entity221 , among others			1
" we always have this need to be vigilant or hypervigilant			0
so when something like this comes on our radar of the possibility of the end , it peaks our adrenaline level			1
... we love disaster , and we love to avert it			2
" but @entity218 , a pleasurably acerbic skeptic who has made documentaries about @entity72 , says it 's hard to persuade people invested in end - times theories to revise their views			1
" the problem is , when you 're faced with the facts , and faced with finding real concrete proof ... 2 plus 2 equals 4 , no matter how many times you add it up			2
" believing in the end offers power to the dispossessed , he adds : " [ if ] there 's this level of feeling of insignificance , what 's the greatest equalizer in the world ? @entity190			1
" ireporter : " 2012 " good , not great sometimes , the fixation can lead to tragedy			0
in 1995 , members of the @entity260 group @entity259 released sarin nerve gas into the @entity263 subway system , killing 12 people			2
two years later , members of the @entity266 committed suicide in the belief that a spaceship was going to come and take them off earth			0
and many terrorists and agitators subscribe to end - times beliefs , with hope that their provocations can lead to apocalypse			1
still , as optimists are fond of pointing out , " apocalypse " does n't mean end , but is @entity279 for " revelation " -- an unveiling of truth			2
in that respect , says @entity94 , a concern about the end can lead to a desire to fix things : hope that we , as humans , can make a positive impact			1
" all of us deep down know that something 's wrong with the world and with us as people , " he says			1
" there is something wired into us , or placed in there by @entity110 , that says , ' every one of you is going to have to deal with the issues that ... are n't right in your life			0
' that does n't have to be a negative			0
it can be a positive			0
it can be where i come to grips with who i am as a person , with who i am before @entity110 , and i make some changes			0
" and for those who are still convinced that 2012 means the collapse of civilization , @entity218 -- who does n't buy it for a minute ( though he ca n't wait to see the movie ) -- is pleased to offer a solution			0
" i want everybody that believes that 2012 is going to happen to send me their stuff , " he says			0
" and if you get mad at me for saying that 2012 is totally insane , you can send me an apology on december 22 , 2012 -- which is a saturday , by the way -- because i 'm still going to be here			0

movies about end of the world particularly present in recent times
professor : one reason could be faster social and technological change
producer : people love adrenaline , and end - of - the - world scenarios provide it
but " @entity66 " is more likely a wake - up call for people to fix their lives , pastor says
