@entity0 awoke on monday to find their 162 - year - old telegram service rendered obsolete , superseded by @entity2 , e-mail and @entity4			1
arguably one of the oldest victims of the digital age , telegrams were the fastest communication method from the 19th century			2
but @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , @entity0 's state - run telecommunications company , announced online that " declining revenues " motivated their decision to end the service			1
they added that their employees would be transferred to their landline , mobile and broadband divisions			2
it comes as no real surprise when even the mail has seen better days			0
the @entity23 postal service lost $ 16 billion in 2012 and $ 1.9 billion in the three months ending march 30			1
it also used up a $ 15 billion loan from the @entity26			0
in @entity28 , telegrams came to an end in 1982 and the queen now sends cards instead of the famous telegram congratulating centenarians and those celebrating diamond wedding anniversaries			1
the first ever telegram read : " @entity41 ? " and was sent from the @entity23 @entity37 in 1844 in @entity38 from @entity39 to @entity40			1
unlike letters , many telegrams had the unique characteristic of typed capital letters and an abrupt " stop " to mark the end of a sentence			1
they were usually sent to congratulate , commiserate , or deliver money or urgent news			0
possibly one of the most notable tragedies to be conveyed was the sinking of the @entity56 ship in 1912			0
@entity57 , the head of the ship 's owners @entity60 , sent this message to the headquarters in @entity63 : " deeply regret advise your titanic sunk this morning fifteenth after collision iceberg resulting serious loss life further particulars later			1
" the shortest ever message was sent by @entity71 ( or , according to other sources , @entity73 ) to his publisher , enquiring about the sales of his latest novel : " ? " wrote the author			0
" ! " replied his publisher			0
many discovered the comical possibilities of such an exchange			0
@entity23 author @entity81 served a witty one - liner to @entity83 in 1897 when his obituary had apparently been published : " the reports of my death are greatly exaggerated			1
" and if a message was misunderstood , humor ensured that all was not lost : " how old @entity89 ? " a reporter questioned the actor			0
how you ? " was his supposed quip			0
and it 's not just email , sms or social media that make some of us inexcusably lazy to talk to someone in the same room			1
@entity28 actor @entity100 ' wife @entity99 answered the door to a couriered message from her husband ordering her to bring him a cup of coffee			0
he was in the upstairs study			0
and he did n't even add a " please " or a " thank you			0
" his explanation could have been that words were of the essence in a telegram , since they were charged			1
however , 10 - 15 words sometimes cost the same as a single word			2
in a handy booklet called : " how to write @entity117 " published in 1929 , @entity115 set out telegram etiquette , including an appeal to preserve politeness , regardless of word count : " a man high in @entity23 business life has been quoted as remarking that elimination of the word ' please ' from all telegrams would save the @entity23 public millions of dollars annually , " wrote @entity115			2
" ' please ' is to the language of social and business intercourse what art and music are to everyday , humdrum existence			0
" by all means let us retain the word ' please ' in our telegraphic correspondence			0
" telegrams marked moments in history or lives and are carefully preserved by individuals , framed in museums , or auctioned to collectors			0
many even rushed to telegraph offices on sunday in @entity0 to send a souvenir telegram to their families and friends , or even themselves			1
but all may not be lost : some global telegram companies are still in operation , even offering @entity152 apps to update the service			1
also , in @entity155 , employees are required to send a telegram when resigning			2
however , although @entity4 may not have the same permanence or command as its predecessor , its success speaks of its convenience : " last january [ 2011 ] , we had 6.86 million followers ; today , at the end of december [ 2012 ] , you are 15.4 million strong , " boasts @entity4 on their blog			1
compare this to around 5,000 telegrams sent by @entity10 in @entity0 a day and it is easy to see how far they lag behind			1
commenting on electronic bill paying , @entity172 chief financial officer @entity171 sums up the battle : " it 's extremely difficult to compete with free			2
" what are your memories of the telegram ? share them in the comments section below .			2
