@entity25 's brothers @entity23 and @entity26 both went down on the @entity28 climb -- also part of the @entity31 classic where @entity4 cracked his skull in april			0

there was no way to stay on your bike , there were people everywhere			0
" as we got back on our bikes and started to re-descend , we just kept coming across more and more crashes ... motorbikes , tv cameras -- it was just bad luck			0
