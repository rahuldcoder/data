-- you might think childbirth would be a topic too personal , too beautiful or way too graphic to write about on @entity4			1
@entity5 , the wife of @entity4 's ceo , posted online from a hospital while she was in labor			1
but , as @entity9 showed on tuesday when she posted @entity4 updates about giving birth to her child , online social networking has pushed its way into the delivery room			1
it 's now a trend for expectant moms to post to sites such as @entity4 from the time they conceive to the moment they deliver a baby into the world			1
@entity9 , wife of @entity4 ceo @entity24 , posted to her 14,000 - plus @entity4 followers when her water broke , when she arrived at the hospital , during contractions and when she decided to get an epidural			1
her husband broke the news on his @entity4 feed that their " perfect baby boy " was delivered on tuesday afternoon			1
as if the real - time drama of her labor was n't enough , @entity9 managed to spice up her @entity4 feed with humor along the way			1
" dear @entity4 , my water broke			1
it was n't like @entity40 in @entity41 , " she wrote at about midnight et on tuesday			2
" now , timing contractions on an @entity44 app. " after noting later that contractions are painful , she wrote , " epidural , yes please			0
" her childbirth drew widespread attention online , where people who have never met @entity9 eagerly awaited the birth of her baby			1
some moms and dads cheered her on , saying that by posting through labor she lifted the veil on a period that can be terrifying for pregnant women who do n't know what to expect when their baby is ready to leave the womb			1
others cringed at the idea , saying childbirth posts are too much information			2
@entity9 ' childbirth is among the first to be publicized though @entity4 , but she 's far from the only woman to have published thoughts about the birth of her child while the process was happening			1
@entity70 , who lives in the @entity71 , said she tweeted through her third childbirth in february to keep her loved ones up to date			0
" at the moment nothing went through my head			0
it was just like , ' this is how i 'm feeling and so this is going out there , and if you do n't like it you do n't have to read it , ' " said the 36 - year - old			0
" afterwards , i was like ' i hope i was n't too gross or graphic			0
' " she said posting to @entity4 helped relieve some of the pain			1
" i would literally be coming down from a really painful contraction and i 'd be saying , ' give me my @entity44 , ' and [ my husband ] would be saying , ' you are weird			0
why are you doing this , ' " she said			0
" some of it was for me			0
it just felt kinda good to get that out there , put that out to the universe so it was n't just my pain , so other people could feel it for me and feel it with me a little bit			0
" @entity97 , a new dad in @entity98 , did the tweeting for his wife			2
while she was in labor , he was busy sending text messages			1
" we were on our @entity44 and @entity103 right up until the point when my wife started pushing , and then we had to put those phones down , " he said			2
@entity97 posted updates about his wife 's labor to @entity4 by using code words only his friends could understand			1
instead of posting " my wife just gave birth , " for instance , he wrote , " @entity114 complete ! @entity116 @entity115 is 7lbs , 2oz , and is very happy to be here			2
" @entity118 , who is the couple 's first child , was born on august 5			2
@entity97 has nearly 800 @entity4 followers and did n't want everyone in the world to know about the " blood and gore " of the birthing process			2
most of the couple 's friends and family live further @entity130 , he said , so the online networks helped them keep their loved ones updated			2
the senior editor at @entity134 said his wife was sending text messages to people throughout her 10 - hour labor			1
" she had an epidural so it was actually pretty easy for her , " he said			0
@entity139 , group manager of the @entity140 , said she would n't feel comfortable sharing so many details on @entity4 , but making such information public could be helpful for pregnant women who are anxious about childbirth			2
" i think it 's great that she [ @entity9 ] can do that with family and friends , and i would imagine a lot of first time moms have curiosity , " she said			1
" they 're peeking into the delivery rooms			0
" @entity97 also said @entity4 posts from the delivery room can be informative			1
" going into it i had a lot of questions because no one really writes about this stuff " online , he said			2
many new sites are promoting " mom - to - mom wisdom " as a way for expecting parents to become educated about childbirth , said @entity167 , spokeswoman for the @entity168 , an online resource for moms			2
@entity167 said one of her friends tweeted through childbirth			0
she had mixed feelings about the posts			0
" although i was happy for the updates , i was like , ' are you sure you want that on @entity4 ? ' " new moms also are joining mom - specific social networks to get important questions answered , said @entity167 , who manages the @entity168 's @entity182 page			1
she said the wisdom of the crowd is useful , but sometimes she recommends pregnant women and new moms see physicians for potentially serious health issues			0
moms are finding other ways to share their pregnancies online , too			2
a quick search on @entity192 found more than 3,600 videos matching " childbirth			0
" and a product called the @entity196 is a belt that wraps around a pregnant woman 's stomach and automatically posts to a @entity4 feed when the baby kicks			1
some people say too much technology in the delivery room is a bad thing			0
" i think it 's terrible , " dr. @entity206 , a psychologist , told the @entity207 in reference to people who post on @entity4 during childbirth			1
" one of the few rituals we have , in terms of giving each other undivided attention , is that time in a delivery room			0
to be spending time writing to someone else destroys the whole ritual			0
" that 's like twittering on your wedding night			0
you can blog about it afterward			0
" the twittering parents , however , said they 're just trying to include as many friends and family members in their special moment as possible			0
" i 've got a lot of people in my life that i love , " @entity70 said , " and i want to keep up on their lives			0
this is one of the biggest events of my life , and so [ writing on @entity4 ] was my way of keeping people posted on what was happening			1
" after his wife gave birth on tuesday , @entity24 beamed on his @entity4 feed			1
" yes ! @ sara gave birth to a perfect baby boy , " he wrote			1
8 pounds , 21 inches ! smiles all around			0
" moments later , friends responded with encouragement			0
" yay ! @ ev and @ sara just had their first baby and it 's a boy -- ca n't wait to meet the mini ceo , " @entity4 co-founder @entity246 wrote .			1
