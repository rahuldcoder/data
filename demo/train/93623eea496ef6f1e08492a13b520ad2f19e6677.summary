-- i am a mother who watched her mother bury her only son			0
mothers who do this wear an excruciatingly blank look of sorrow and disorientation			1
their eyes grow dim and damp			0
they move slowly , laboring to adjust to a horrific new reality			0
not only does the heart of a mother split open when a child dies , but time itself breaks in two , reordered into the time before his death and the time after			0
i know the empty eyes well			0
my mother had them for years after the death of my 17 - year - old brother , @entity24			0
@entity25 , the mother of @entity27 , and @entity28 , @entity29 's mother , have appeared on in news interviews in recent days			1
they still have those eyes			0
now @entity34 , @entity35 's mother , has the gruesome , unnatural task of burying her baby boy , a devastating detail often lost amid the aggressive noise surrounding the trauma in @entity40 , @entity41			1
complete coverage of @entity40 shooting and protests the mothers of @entity29 , @entity46 , @entity27 and now @entity35 are in a particularly sad sorority			1
not only do they have to negotiate life without their sons , but they must conduct the rough rituals of mourning under the incredible burden of the violence , systemic racism , hidden history and injustice that brought them to this place			1
there 's a dignity that comes with losing sons as soldiers , and there 's a sympathy that comes to mothers who lose them to illness or a tragic accident , as was the case of my brother			1
but these other mothers have none of that relief ; their sons were healthy , surefooted and unarmed			1
now these women are thrust into spotlights , tasked with asking for prayers and patience and peace in the street -- when their own peace wo n't come			1
we mothers who watch these wounded women go through this , pull our own young men closer and strategize how to keep them from this fate			1
it 's an unfair burden			1
in fact , every time a high - profile killing of an unarmed black male by law enforcement hits the news , black parents again have " the talk " with their sons about what to do , and perhaps more critically , what not to do when encountering police			1
and every time it 's infuriating to reach for this desperate yet fatally flawed strategy : a one - sided instruction to help save them in a two - sided , potentially deadly relationship			1
yesterday , i had a conversation with a friend who is a @entity107 producer with two sons living in an affluent neighborhood in @entity110			2
she told me that the details of her " talk " may be different from mothers in low - income communities , but she 's clear that wealth does not protect her sons from dangerous encounters with the police			1
indeed , she told me that some high - income mothers are so acutely aware of the way police view black men in @entity124 , that a group of the mothers got together and invited a high - ranking police officer over for tea to introduce him to their sons			1
the intent ? " officer , meet my son			0
he 's not a thug , a thief or a threat			2
if you see him in a fancy car or walking down the street wearing sporty teen boy gear , please do n't kill him , ok ? " it 's a clever tactic ( as pathetic as it is that there is a need for it ) and a step in the right direction			2
consider : black mothers and fathers all over the country for generations have been telling their kids how to act around law enforcement , but who is instructing law enforcement about how to act when encountering our boys ? it is painfully evident that much of law enforcement is ignorant of black youth culture			0
police are armed with ready guns , misinformed stereotypes and irrational fear			2
they obviously have not engaged enough with our youth to know about them			0
many police officers have no imagination to allow black teens the adolescent recklessness they instinctively give white youth			2
if no one institutes a plan to reform the culture of policing by educating police about the culture of black youth , this lopsided relationship will continue to produce tragedies such as what we 're witnessing in @entity40			2
the burden has far too long been shouldered by black parents and kids , requiring them to adjust to the injustice of excessive force , police brutality and ignorance			2
police officers must become more responsible for knowing the community they 're hired to protect and serve ( even fast food workers are trained to know their customers )			0
the residents of @entity40 and cities all over @entity196 have been grossly underserved and fatally misunderstood			0
we should not be asking outraged mothers , fathers , families and communities to stop hollering			0
we should be asking trained law enforcement to put down their guns and listen up			0
magazine : the aftermath in @entity40 read more about the flash point in the @entity207 at @entity0 / @entity196			0

@entity209 : moms who lose sons wear blank look of sorrow . @entity35 's does now
she says they are thrust into spotlight to call for peace as they process *private* trauma
she says moms looking on renew ' the talk ' with their sons . why should they have to do this ?
@entity227 : police are ones who must be educated to deal with young men , not the other way around
