-- it was n't until soccer referee @entity2 died that i started to really think about what happened there , and not just because i grew up on the field myself			1
like @entity2 , my father was a volunteer referee			1
he was my coach for years in the town league			2
when i grew up and moved on , he missed those days of camaraderie and competition			2
he missed supporting kids and being a part of their development , teaching them to love the game , to deal appropriately with the highs and the lows			2
so , when i no longer provided even a sideline to invest in , he volunteered			2
i was happy he was getting involved			2
he knew the game , and kids , so well by then			2
i can not imagine it being the death of him like it was for @entity2 who died saturday night , a week after a punch from a 17 - year - old player put him in a coma in the @entity25 suburb of @entity26			1
@entity2 was issuing a yellow card -- a warning card , not an expulsion card - against the player who had been arguing with him			1
that player punched him in the side of the head , causing serious injury			2
while the cause of death has yet to be officially confirmed , @entity2 never woke up from the resulting coma			1
the secret risk of youth sports i 've been in adult coed games where i feared for somebody 's well being off the field			1
it was scary ( and annoying , quite frankly , because it disrupted play while we all sat around watching someone get calmed down )			2
but , as a lifetime athlete , i 'm also kind of familiar with that aggression , granted on a much smaller scale , and i see the seeds of it in my children			1
if genetics are anything , my husband and i have blessed our daughters with natural athletic ability and cursed them with an unnatural intensity and self - criticism			2
i hyperventilated and sulked and once even stomped off a field yelling obscenities at my coach			1
we watch our older daughter , @entity64 , who is 3 1/2 , and joke about how she 's doomed to be like us , but really , we 're both concerned			1
like any kid , @entity64 wants us to watch every @entity66 © , every somersault , and if she ca n't do something , she almost immediately yells " i ca n't do it ! " then throws whatever 's in her hand and marches off			1
so young , and already her above average coordination is mixing poorly with a need for perfection			1
5 anger management tips for children that 's what dr. @entity78 , a youth sports psychologist in @entity79 and founder of youthsportspsychology.com , calls it -- perfectionism			1
it 's that self - criticism so common to athletes that can intensify in the teen years , because , well , they 're adolescents			1
" perfectionists have a difficult time with making mistakes , " @entity78 said , when asked how to cultivate resilience on the sports field			1
" we help these athletes manage their high expectations about performance and to react better to mistakes			2
" many children link their self - esteem with their performance			1
if they perform badly , their self - esteem suffers			2
it 's important for parents to help their kids separate their self - worth from achievement in sports			1
" @entity78 specializes in how mental attitudes shape performance and works with professional teams , athletes , parents , even corporations , on how to develop that attitude			1
how to prevent sports injuries in kids not only is this strength , this ability to cope with adversity , with challenge , an excellent life skill , it 's also , as we see more and more these days , about safety			1
a competitive sport inherently involves some aggression ; how do we know when a kid is crossing a line ? how do we prevent or police the transition from competitive to dangerously aggressive ? " sports itself requires athletes to assert themselves against an opponent , such as to obtain possession of a soccer ball or basketball , " @entity78 said			1
" but athletes cross the line between assertive behavior and aggressive behavior when they break the rules in sports or intentionally try to harm other athletes , coaches , or referees			1
" and this is more likely to happen when athletes become frustrated or angry			2
so , if we teach them to deal with frustration and anger , we can help prevent violence , of any scale , on the field			1
my outbursts were minimal when i was younger , when my father was an active part of my game experience			1
he was known for how level headed and fair he was			2
and this rubbed off on all of us			2
granted , later , when i became more independent and my parents were less involved , my temper flared			1
maybe i was missing other role models			0
i 'm sure i was tying my self - worth to my game			0
certainly , when i had a supportive coach , i acted out less			0
parents are key to cultivating this capability , but , @entity78 says , everybody is responsible for modeling as well as actively making a healthy attitude happen -- parents , coaches , even the leagues , which should set up bylaws , outlining acceptable behavior , and then enforce those rules			1
" and the parents ca n't be afraid to report bullying or bad behavior			1
athletes , as well , should look out for their teammates , " @entity78 notes			0
why i told my daughter she sucks at sports according to his daughter , @entity185 , her father was a ref because he was passionate about the game			1
" he loved soccer , " she told @entity187			1
" we just never thought this was going to happen			0
he loved what he did and it was his passion			0
" as an adult , when i was somehow completely free of social and personal pressure , i would often sit in my car after a soccer game , removing my muddy cleats , reflecting on how truly joyous it is to play just for the love of it			1
i want my children to feel that from the start , free from violent disruptions , both internal and external			1
because there is no role model more powerful than a parent , and no better way to take back our ball fields than raising kids with composure , here are more tools for parents on how to raise real athletes , on and off the field			1
tools for parents dr. @entity78 created a pre- and post-game checklist to help parents encourage balance and positivity in their child 's athletic experience			1
some of the to - dos will be more challenging than others			0
in general , the message is : stay positive , calm , neutral , and leave the game on the field			1
this will help your child keep his sense of self - worth separate from performance and help him trust his coach and the officials			0
5 pre-game to - @entity241 1			0
help your child or teen feel confident about today 's game or competition			1
if you discuss the game , remember to be positive about your athlete 's past experiences and successes			1
do n't point out mistakes or losses			0
stay away from the subject of avoiding mistakes from previous games			0
say , " have fun ! i know you 'll do your best ! " 2			0
leave the coaching to the coach			0
show that you support the coach 's decisions			1
do n't talk about how you 'd like the coach to manage the team or how you disagree with some of his decisions			0
this will undermine your athletes ' confidence and trust			0
they need to enter the game trusting their coaches			0
keep your emotions in check			0
be a good role model for composure			2
if you show that you 're jittery , nervous , or worried about the game or competition , your child or teen will likely be affected by these feelings			0
be composed on the sidelines before the game			0
demonstrate your trust in the coach , the players , and the referees			0
do n't express your feelings about who should play , or how the coach should play the kids , or how you view a particular ref. be only positive and supportive			0
find ways to support the teamâ € ” by bringing water or snacks , for example , or serving as scorekeeper if the team needs a parent to do this			0
avoid prolonged discussions about your athlete 's technique or mechanics before the game			1
just before a game , athletes need to believe in what they 've learned and trust in their abilities			0
if you focus too much on mechanics and technique , they may freeze up			0
it may be difficult for them to play freely and with trust in their abilities			0
avoid saying things like , " remember the @entity321 and be sure to kick with the side of your foot instead of your toe			0
" say instead , " go for it ! have a blast			0
" 5 post-game to - @entity241 1			0
start by making two positive comments about your son or daughter 's game			1
pick out two simple areas you can complement your son or daughter about			2
for example , " you really hit the ball great off the tee today and made a great comeback after a slow start			0
" you are more likely to get your player 's attention by starting with a couple of positive comments			2
ask your player , " what are two things you did well today ? " discuss these first no matter how well or poorly your child played			0
be mindful of the subtle rewards or punishment you may unknowingly or knowingly give your player after the game			0
for example , showing excitement and enthusiasm ( for good play ) is a reward for your child			2
withdrawing attention or being silent ( after a bad performance ) is a form of punishment for your child			0
avoid dwelling on numbers , scores , or position in the event after the game or performance			0
discuss statistics only if necessary to make a point			0
perfectionists are too obsessed about statistics already , which does not help them maintain a process focus during performance			0
leave sports on the playing field ! avoid discussing the game at home and help your child shift gears into other roles in life			1
do not go over the play by play unless your child asks			0
focus on developing balance in life rather than being 24/7 sports			2
