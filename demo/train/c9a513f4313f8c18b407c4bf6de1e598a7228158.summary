@entity0 , @entity1 -- the border crossing at @entity0 in southern @entity1 is not much to look at			1
a small police post , another for the @entity6 , a customs shed -- and beyond that 200 meters of no - man 's land			0
in between here and the @entity13 border , a dog -- presumably of dual nationality -- lies in the sunshine			1
behind the red - and - white - checkered barrier on the @entity13 side , a handful of soldiers pace up and down			1
another peers down from a roof			0
a truck with a large green @entity13 flag draws up			1
a smiling colonel @entity23 looks down from a mural and a large banner bears the legend " congratulations to the brother leader			0
" several days ago , @entity13 soldiers abandoned this remote frontier post as anti-government groups took over the town of @entity33 , 70 kilometers from the border along a twisting mountain road			1
but on monday @entity13 troops loyal to @entity23 returned to reclaim control of the frontier			2
a @entity1 man at the border -- one of several attracted from the nearby town to witness this rare burst of activity -- excitedly shows a @entity2 crew cellphone video of a @entity13 military helicopter that had landed with reinforcements			1
another murmurs that if we want to enter @entity13 , he knows smuggling trails through the mountains -- forbidding ochre - colored cliffs that rise on either side of the border			1
unlike the crossing 150 miles to the north , the border at @entity0 has no crush of foreign workers desperate to escape the violence in @entity13			1
there is a trickle of @entity62 , a few from @entity64 coming over , but the loudest noise is the chirping of sparrows in the customs shed			0
one young @entity62 who worked in a @entity13 aluminum plant , talks of an odyssey from @entity72 , where he worked			2
threatened by @entity13 soldiers , he says he and a few friends fled south and tried to enter @entity76			2
when that did n't work , he ended up here			0
he and others say @entity33 remains in the control of anti-government groups , but there is anxiety that @entity84 forces nearby will launch an assault			0
like much of @entity13 , the fate of this area is far from decided			1
in the late afternoon , there is a shift change among the handful of @entity1 soldiers deployed at the border			1
the new arrivals lounge against the border gate , chatting and smoking -- oblivious to the drama playing out a few miles away			0
a @entity98 shepherd swaddled in rough brown cloth minds his flock of goats just beyond the razor wire			0
there is sudden movement on the @entity13 side			2
the gate goes up and several 4x4 vehicles , caked in dust , pass through			0
they are , bizarrely enough , part of a rally - - " @entity112 2011			0
" the sun slips behind the mountains , the sparrows fall quiet -- and the border at @entity0 waits for its next arrivals .			2

at a lonely crossing on the @entity1 - @entity13 border , all is quiet
like much of @entity13 , the fate of this area is far from decided
