@entity0 , @entity1 -- on june 8 , 2009 , nearly one year ago , i stood before a judge in @entity6 's @entity5 and was sentenced to 12 years in one of the country 's notoriously brutal labor camps , also known as death camps			1
my legs wobbled in fear , and i grabbed the podium in front of me , fearing i would faint			0
three months earlier , i was on assignment for @entity16			0
i was reporting on the trafficking of @entity6 , most of them women , who escape to neighboring @entity20 , where they are used and exploited			1
following a local guide we 'd hired , my colleague @entity22 and i did regretfully step foot into @entity6 territory for no more than a minute			1
as we made our way back to @entity20 , @entity6 soldiers chased us onto @entity20 soil and violently dragged us back into @entity6			1
we were the first @entity30 tried in @entity6 's highest court			1
our sentence , two years for trespassing and 10 for " hostile " acts , shows where the @entity6 government 's real concerns lie			2
leery about a negative portrayal of its regime , the @entity6 authorities decided the documentary we were making would threaten their government			1
it was seen as a hostile act meant to weaken or bring down the country			0
no country on @entity48 is more paranoid about its image than @entity6 , which has maintained its firm grip on power in part because of its ability to indoctrinate its people			1
@entity6 is one of the world 's most closed - off societies , with little known about what goes on inside			2
its citizens know little about the outside world			0
the regime 's mass propaganda machine carefully and consistently disseminates information to the @entity6 citizenry extolling the virtues of the communist state and its megalomaniacal " @entity67 , " @entity67			1
during nearly five months of captivity , i was allowed to watch television in a guard 's area and saw black - and - white movies about the @entity74 and the heroic communists defeating their arch - enemy , the @entity30			2
rallies celebrating a recent satellite launch or nuclear test featured @entity6 men and women proudly , defiantly waving their fists in the air			2
i rarely spotted any young adults , or college - aged spectators within the crowds , just older folks who seemed less likely to cause disruptions			0
with their booming voices , newsreaders listed off the latest achievements made by @entity67 , such as the opening of a chicken - processing factory or the building of a dam			2
at night , i had to put a pillow over my head to drown out the patriotic anthems sung by the military choir			0
but beneath all this flag - waving is a different reality			0
escapees from @entity6 paint a stark picture of a place where human rights do n't exist			1
the slightest criticism or disrespect paid towards @entity67 could land one in a hard labor camp , where starved and tortured prisoners scavenge for food while performing backbreaking work			2
when my current tv colleagues and i were in the northeastern part of @entity20 that borders @entity6 , we spoke with several defectors who had fled the desperate conditions , seeking food and freedom across the border			1
while they have been able to get more sustenance in @entity20 , freedom has not come as easily			2
the @entity20 government does not regard these defectors as refugees , even though they face certain , brutal punishment if they are sent back to @entity6			1
a young woman , whom i 'll call @entity128 , recounted her escape , braving the rushing waters of the @entity131 that separates @entity6 and @entity20			1
not knowing how to swim , she nervously made her way across the frigid waters in the dark			0
she had been told she could find a better life in @entity20 and that there would be work opportunities in the computer industry			2
instead she was placed in the online sex industry and was forced to undress for clients who watched her via the web			0
her boss tied her arms behind her back and locked her in a room to prevent her from escaping			0
with help from a friend , she was able to get away , but with nowhere to go and no money , she ended up working for another online sex company			0
she was grateful that her boss treated her humanely and allowed her to go outside for breaks			0
with tears streaming , smearing her thick black eyeliner , she spoke of how much she missed her mother			0
@entity128 's story is becoming increasingly common as traffickers prey on vulnerable and scared women from @entity6			2
many others are sold like commodities into loveless marriages where they are abused and treated like slaves			0
@entity6 women have no legal status in @entity20 , so the children they bear with @entity20 husbands also suffer			1
the @entity20 government does not grant these children citizenship ; they must live in the shadows as stateless children with no access to public health care or education			2
if the mothers are deported , or leave their husbands , the children are often left abandoned and orphaned			0
during my captivity , i thought about the @entity6 defectors who had opened their lives to me			1
thinking about their struggles gave me strength to endure			0
i might have been living the biggest horror of my life , but what i was going through paled in comparison to what @entity6 in their country and in neighboring @entity20 have lived through and continue to struggle against today			1
i am fortunate to be home in @entity30 now , where freedom is my birthright			0
organizations such as the nonprofit @entity195 ) are on the frontlines of raising awareness about the desperate plight of @entity6 defectors and helping escapees find refuge in countries where they can begin new lives			1
@entity205 's campaign " @entity207 " aims to rescue and resettle 100 @entity6 defectors			1
their efforts are risky because they must shuttle defectors from secret shelters in various countries across @entity212 before they can find safe haven in countries such as @entity215 or the @entity30			0
this video shows @entity6 defector , @entity218 , and his journey to freedom with the help of @entity205			2
recently a bill was introduced in @entity223 by @entity224 , @entity225 in the @entity226 , and rep. @entity227 , @entity1 , and @entity228 , @entity229 , in the @entity230 that seeks to address the issue of @entity6 orphans and stateless children in @entity20			1
if passed , the bill will help pave the way for families in the @entity30 to adopt eligible children			0
in june , i stood before a @entity6 judge and expressed my hope that the @entity30 and @entity6 might one day establish closer relations			1
i also promised that if released , i would never report on the issue of defectors or @entity6 human rights abuses again			1
that is an oath i can not keep as long as the people of @entity6 remain silenced			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 .			0

@entity251 recalls frightening day she was sentenced for entering @entity6
during captivity she was forced to watch films *praising* regime and @entity67 , she says
reality in country is harsh ( starvation , no human rights ) but fleeing to @entity20 barely better
@entity251 : @entity264 and *pending* *federal* *legislation* give hope to @entity6 defectors
