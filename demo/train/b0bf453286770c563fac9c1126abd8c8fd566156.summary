-- in what is becoming an annual rite of fall , tablet makers are rushing to release a fresh selection of devices this month in time for the competitive holiday - shopping season			2
let 's start with market leader @entity9 , which is expected to unveil new @entity10 on tuesday in @entity11			1
at 1 p.m. et , @entity9 ceo @entity12 will take the stage in front of an auditorium of journalists and announce updated products with the help of some videos , other @entity9 executives and possibly a live product demonstration or two			1
we 'll be live - blogging the announcement here at @entity0 / tech. the main attraction is expected to be upgrades to @entity9 's @entity10 line of tablets			1
the @entity29 will likely inherit the high - resolution retina display that came out on last - year 's full - size @entity10			1
the fifth - generation @entity10 will probably get a slight design makeover , slimming down and dropping a bit of weight			1
expect to see faster processors speeding up both devices			0
a fingerprint - sensor security system , like the one on the new @entity37 , is also a possibility but is less likely			0
there have also been rumors , fueled in part by @entity9 's " we still have a lot to cover " invite , about a keyboard cover for the @entity10 , like the ones on @entity46 's rival surface tablets			1
@entity9 also could include some @entity47 upgrade news by announcing release dates for the new , redesigned @entity50 and its latest @entity47 operating system , @entity52			1
( analysts do n't expect to see a refreshed line of @entity55 this time around			0
nor will we likely see a smartwatch or an @entity9 tv set			2
) but @entity9 's not the only tablet manufacturer announcing news this week			1
@entity46 is releasing the latest versions of its surface tablets , and @entity63 is expected to announce new @entity65 devices on tuesday			1
but as rivals catch up to the once - dominant @entity10 and the marketplace gets flooded with new tablets , it 's getting harder for competitors to set themselves apart			1
" tablets are a maturing market ; there 's not much competitors can do to differentiate at this point			0
" said @entity75 , a senior analyst at @entity76			0
" replacement sales are growing much , much faster than new sales worldwide , " she added			2
" you 're competing for customers you already have			0
" now the companies are going after emerging markets , and that 's where price will be a more important factor , @entity75 said			0
" everyone is looking at @entity9 as the gold standard ... ( and ) in that position they do n't have to hit rock bottom with their prices to justify their product , " she said			2
touchscreen tablets have become hugely popular since the first @entity10 was released in 2010			1
according to a recent study by the @entity95 , 35 % of all @entity96 older than 16 now own a tablet , and 24 % have e-readers like @entity100 's @entity99			0
the hunger for tablets , which are quickly crowding out the pc , is expected to jump another 79 % by 2017 , according to research firm @entity104			2
@entity9 is still the dominant tablet manufacturer , but competing products are steadily nibbling away at its lead			2
in the second quarter of this year , @entity9 had 32 % of the global tablet market , a sharp decline from the 60 % it had the same time a year before , according to @entity104			2
@entity113 is the second - largest tablet maker			1
this year , people will weigh features like price and size -- tablets can start at 6 inches ( typically a hybrid between a smartphone and a tablet ) and go up to 10 inches or more			0
most have only slight differences in exterior design , including variations in weight and thickness , texture and color			0
but when it comes to giant flat rectangles with one side dominated entirely by a screen , it 's the software , speed and screen quality that matter most			0
some people are loyal to specific ecosystems , choosing @entity141 or @entity142 products based on the apps and content they already own or the selection of popular apps available for the devices			0
some devices promote unique features , like the new @entity151 from @entity100 that features live , video - chat tech support available anytime for free			0
@entity154 released a new version of its 7 - inch nexus tablet over the summer			0
@entity113 also has a line of popular @entity159 android devices .			1

@entity9 is expected to announce updates to its line of @entity10 tablets on tuesday
the @entity29 will likely get a higher - res screen ; larger models will get lighter , faster
@entity46 and @entity63 are also expected to announce tablets this week
@entity9 sells the most tablets worldwide , followed by @entity113
