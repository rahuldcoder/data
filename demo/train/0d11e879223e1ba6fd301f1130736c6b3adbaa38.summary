-- @entity1 once suggested women footballers should wear tighter shorts -- now his organization , @entity4 , has been accused of blatant sexism in its selection of the person to lead an investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity10			1
the investigation and subsequent report by @entity14 lawyer @entity13 , head of @entity4 's investigative chamber of the ethics committee , has become emblematic of the world governing body 's reluctance to embrace a greater degree of transparency following criticism of the way @entity4 is run			1
@entity4 president @entity1 does n't want the report published because he fears it will contravene @entity4 's privacy laws , though @entity13 and others such as the head of @entity32 soccer @entity30 president @entity29 have indicated they 'd like it to be made public			1
now three former members of the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) , the body tasked with working on reform proposals and drawing up a shortlist of candidates to lead the investigation into the bids for the @entity43 , which were awarded to @entity44 and @entity45 , have told @entity0 that @entity4 officials insisted that a woman should not be nominated for the role @entity13 eventually assumed			1
according to two of those former @entity37 members , @entity13 , who recently delivered his long - awaited report , was not even on the original shortlist of candidates to lead the investigation			1
@entity55 , who left the @entity37 in april last year after becoming frustrated with the lack of progress being made , recalls the occasion in 2012 where she was left stunned by suggestions that the committee should not consider any female candidates for the lead investigator role			1
sitting in the dining hall with two @entity37 colleagues during @entity4 's @entity66 in @entity67 that year , she claims she was approached by two senior @entity4 employees			1
" i turned from the group to face them and one of the men told me , ' stop putting women forward for these positions			0
' he told me they would not be acceptable and that i was fighting the wrong battle , " @entity55 said			0
" i did n't really take in what he was saying and then it hit me			0
" i said , ' did you really just say that ? ' i was startled			0
they started to elaborate on their views and gave me more and more details			0
" i was the only woman at the table and they were directing their views just at me			0
" @entity89 , a fellow member of the @entity37 was also present alongside @entity90 when a discussion was had over the possibility of female nominations			0
he said the @entity4 officials did not approach her and tell her to stop putting forth women , but confirmed to @entity0 that the two men said that it would be very unlikely that @entity98 would appoint a woman because @entity4 is still very unbalanced in gender terms			2
when @entity0 then approached @entity101 -- who chaired the @entity37 until its final report in april 2014 to discuss the allegation -- he said : " it is true that @entity4 was not keen to elect women into these positions			1
" when @entity0 contacted @entity4 with the allegation , a spokesperson reiterated the organization 's support of women			2
" at the time the president has explained that the candidate would have the full support of the football world , " the spokesperson said			0
" it is about acceptance			0
unfortunately , a female may find it difficult to lead an investigation in certain parts of the world			2
" that 's unfortunate but you have to look at what will be acceptable to the majority of people within football throughout the world			0
" the investigator would be working at all levels of football in dealing with ethics			0
" the president hopes that there will be more women in leading positions in football			0
" there are already three women on the @entity98 ( @entity141 ) and that shows @entity4 's commitment to women and their importance			2
" last month , @entity1 spoke of @entity4 's " exemplary organization in ethics " while addressing the @entity148 in @entity149			1
but @entity4 is facing more questions , with the process through which @entity13 was appointed as the lead investigator under scrutiny			1
how the former @entity14 attorney for the @entity155 came to write the report is something of a conundrum , given he was not included on the original shortlist of candidates to lead the investigation			1
a @entity4 spokesperson confirmed to @entity0 that when a shortlist of eight names -- which were compiled in order of ranking -- was submitted to football 's world governing body in may 2012 , @entity13 's name was absent			1
the names , which were submitted for the investigative and adjudicatory positions by the @entity37 before @entity90 was approached in @entity67 , included four men and four women -- all of whom worked in either the judicial or investigative sector			0
the choice of @entity13 was met with surprise by those at the @entity37 given the nature of their recommendations , with chairman @entity101 suggesting that the @entity185 prosecutor was not his first choice			2
the credentials of @entity13 , who worked in the last @entity190 administration , are impressive , but @entity101 's preference to lead the investigation was @entity194 prosecutor @entity193 , whose nomination was vetoed by the country 's president @entity196			1
the second - choice candidate was unable to take up the role because of illness and has since passed away , according to @entity101			0
according to a @entity4 spokesperson , the @entity37 was not the only body to offer potential nominations for the role of lead investigator			1
@entity101 says the nomination of @entity13 came through the secretary general of @entity209 @entity208			2
@entity13 , who once worked as vice-president of the @entity211 on @entity209 's executive committee , currently works in @entity185 as a partner at @entity214			2
@entity4 and @entity209 , the world 's largest police organization , enjoy a partnership which stretches back to 2011			2
the 10 - year agreement , which is worth â‚¬ 20 million ( $ 25 million ) and was set up to combat match fixing , has helped to create a dedicated sports integrity unit in @entity220 which opened on tuesday			0
an @entity209 spokesman confirmed that while the two bodies do enjoy a close relationship , @entity209 did not make the appointment of @entity13 -- though he commented that " @entity4 could find no better man or woman to discharge the duties assigned to mr. @entity13			1
" when asked whether @entity209 had received any specific instructions over the gender of candidates , the spokesman replied : " when it comes to promoting gender equality , @entity209 has led by example			0
" the world police body 's president is a woman			0
its cabinet director and head of its global awareness initiative , @entity241 , is a woman			0
the head of @entity209 's @entity244 and @entity245 unit is a woman			0
and one of its key @entity249 managers is a woman			0
" the controversy over @entity13 's appointment comes in the wake of his statement , published last week , which called on @entity4 to publish his report in full			1
such a move is unlikely			0
@entity255 , who presides over the adjudicatory arm of @entity4 's ethics committee , told reporters earlier this month that only his findings would be published and not @entity13 's report			1
that move was met with condemnation by some @entity264 members			0
@entity265 , the president of @entity266 , has urged for the report to be published , as have @entity4 vice-presidents @entity269 from @entity270 and @entity271 of @entity272			1
" given the limited role mr. @entity255 envisions for the @entity275 , i believe it is now necessary for the @entity264 to authorize the appropriate publication of the report on the @entity279 into the 2018/2022 @entity280 , " read @entity13 's statement			1
" publication would be consistent with statements made by a number of @entity141 members , with the view recently expressed by @entity37 chair @entity101 , and with the goals of the reform process			0
" his call appears to have fallen on deaf ears , with @entity1 insisting he has not had any contact with @entity13			2
" the only contact we have had with the president of the ( ethics committee ) investigatory chamber has been his press releases that we have received in @entity4 , " @entity1 told reporters			2
" but we have not received any demands or requests from mr. @entity13 to speak to us , or to ask that we should make a decision on this report and to publish this report , and to change the confidentiality which is in the code of ethics of @entity4			1
" @entity1 's stance has been supported by @entity4 's legal director @entity307 , who said that witness confidentiality could prove difficult to sustain if the report was published			1
" the code of ethics is based on certain principles , one of which is confidentiality , " @entity307 told reporters			0
" cooperation between witnesses and the ethics committee is based on confidentiality , if not perhaps certain witnesses , whistleblowers or other parties might not cooperate to such an extent , " he said , adding that 75 witnesses had been heard during @entity13 's investigation			2
@entity0 contacted @entity13 's office in @entity185 to ask whether it could answer questions relating to his omission from the original list , his recommendation by @entity209 and the gender - specific allegations			1
a spokesman for @entity13 said all inquiries should be made to @entity4 .			1
