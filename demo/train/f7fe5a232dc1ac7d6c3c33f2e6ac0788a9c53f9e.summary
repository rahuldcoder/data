-- @entity1 made tennis history friday -- and another entry in the record books is within her reach			1
having become the first @entity7 player to reach the semifinals of the season - ending @entity9 , she can become the first @entity10 to be ranked as high as third in the world if she beats @entity12 on saturday			1
@entity1 is currently fifth but has been as high as fourth -- which has only been matched by @entity15 's @entity14 , back in the 1990s			1
victory over @entity12 will put her above @entity17 , who is absent with a shoulder injury , and @entity19 -- who lost all three matches this week			2
she ensured there would be no repeat of her two previous disappointments in @entity24 as she defeated injury - hit world no. 2 @entity25 6 - 2 6 - 1 to win her third successive match in the @entity28			1
" i know this is not the best way to win the match , " @entity1 said , referring to the @entity30 's fitness problems			1
" i saw her a little bit bothered with her back but she kept playing , so it was very tough for me mentally			2
" if she were healthy she would have been a very tough opponent today			0
unfortunately she was n't healthy			0
i have to enjoy this moment , but i hope the injury is n't too bad and she can come back soon			0
" having beaten the 2011 runner - up , @entity1 will next face that year 's victor after fourth seed @entity12 battled back to seal her last - four place with a 6 - 7 ( 3 - 7 ) 6 - 2 6 - 3 win over @entity43			1
@entity12 finished second in the @entity44 behind world no. 1 @entity45 , who had a rest day after notching up three successive wins in her title defense			1
the @entity48 will face former top - ranked @entity50 @entity49 , whose closing defeat against the already - eliminated @entity52 of @entity53 was meaningless following @entity1 's win			1
@entity12 revealed that she is reaping the benefits of working with a new fitness coach since the @entity57 , where she exited in the third round			2
since then she won the title in @entity60 and lost to @entity49 in the @entity62 semis after beating @entity1 in the previous round			1
" we had like 14 days of hard work , so i think that it shows on the court , " the world @entity64 said of her post-new @entity67 training regime			2
" i felt very confident on the court when i played in @entity60 , which was better , and i played two matches in one day , so i thought that it 's going to be tough but i did quite well			2
" @entity25 , however , has struggled at the tail end of this season -- which she began so brightly at the top of the rankings before beating @entity1 in january 's @entity81 final to deny the @entity7 player a second grand slam title			1
" i served really hard , and i do n't know , just really locked my back , " the @entity57 finalist said , and then explained why she did n't retire hurt			0
" i do n't have a tournament next week			0
the physio told me , ' you 're really locked			0
there is no real structure damage , but you ca n't fix it that quickly			0
" i just wanted to try to do my best for the fans who came and watched our match , for respect for my opponent			0
it was just about trying to do the most you can out there			0
" i think i can learn a lot from these little things to prevent maybe some of the injuries			0
some things you can not , but , you know , for the next year i will be ready , much better , i 'm sure about it			0
