@entity25 , @entity26 : hi , i 'm @entity28			1
@entity30 news starts right now ! first up : @entity31 10,000 @entity32 : we begin on @entity34 , where the @entity31 ended yesterday above 10,000			1
so what ? well , for one , the @entity31 is made up of thirty of the biggest stocks , and a lot of people use it as a guide of how the overall market is doing			2
secondly , this is the first time the @entity31 has gone over 10,000 in more than a year			2
that could mean that investors think the @entity12 economy is recovering from last year 's crisis			1
but some experts are warning things could still take a step backward			2
health care hurdles @entity32 : health care reform			1
yesterday , we outlined the next steps for @entity53			2
but what about just ordinary folks ? some people are concerned that if health care reform gets passed , it might include some things they do n't agree with			1
@entity60 breaks down some of the biggest questions in this debate			1
( @entity64 ) @entity65 , @entity0 correspondent : at this moment , as you watch at home , the president and other politicians here in @entity70 are also watching you , because they really do n't know what you want or what you will support			2
and their jobs down the road depend on figuring that out			2
it 's also safe to say they 're highly sensitive to the three questions you care about most			1
the first we 've heard in virtually every one of those town hall meetings : what about my insurance , the care i have now ? @entity88 : i 'm leaving			1
@entity89 : even though most @entity12 want reform , almost 80 percent told the @entity93 / @entity92 pollster they are pleased with their own health care			1
and many fear reform could force them to change			2
@entity96 : why would we have to change if we 're completely satisfied with what we have ? @entity89 : the president says no , you wo n't be forced , but the opposition has whipped that worry into a frenzy			2
television ad : for seniors , this will mean long waits for care , cuts to @entity109 , @entity111 scans and other vital tests			1
seniors may lose their own doctors			2
@entity89 : here 's the second question			2
what about big government getting even bigger ? again , a very hot issue in all those town halls			2
@entity96 : this government is out of control ! we are in debt up to our eyeballs and you all are doing nothing but putting more debt on us and our children			2
and it 's got to stop ! @entity89 : @entity131 / @entity130 found more than half the voters think big government is a bigger threat to the future than big labor unions or big business			2
the bailouts , the soaring deficit all driving that concern			2
and finally , what if this measure passes but fails to produce the results that people expect or want ? health insurance for everyone was the president 's goal , but even if the plan approved by the @entity151 committee passes , the @entity148 estimates that 25 million people will still be uninsured in 10 years			1
and the rest of us ? well , an @entity157 / @entity156 poll found 70 percent of you think reform will make your care no better , might make it even worse			1
fair or not , these are real challenges that you have raised for supporters of this measure			2
( @entity167 ) is this legit ? @entity168 , @entity26 : is this legit ? the @entity12 is the largest country in the world			1
nope ! when it comes to total area , @entity11 is the largest country			1
the @entity12 comes in third			1
missile diplomacy @entity32 : representatives from both the @entity12 and @entity11 met in @entity9 this week as secretary of state @entity175 sat down with @entity11 president @entity176			1
one of the biggest issues on the agenda : missile defense			1
the @entity12 recently said it was dropping plans to build a missile defense system in @entity183 and the @entity184 ; @entity11 had wanted the @entity12 to drop those plans			1
during a radio interview , secretary @entity175 suggested that the @entity12 and @entity11 could and should work together on missile defense			1
@entity12 secretary of state hillary clinton : it is imperative for countries like @entity11 , the @entity12 and @entity191 to lead against the forces of disintegration and destruction , so that we can stand united against those who would undermine the opportunities that we are seeking to promote			1
@entity199 @entity198 @entity32 : the number of troops in @entity199 is increasing			2
@entity203 prime minister @entity202 announced wednesday that 500 additional forces will be heading to the country			2
that will bring the total number of @entity203 troops serving in @entity199 to 9,500			0
meanwhile , president @entity209 held the latest in a series of meetings with military , foreign policy and national security advisers yesterday			0
they 're all reviewing the @entity12 strategy in the @entity199 conflict and how it should move forward			1
one big point under consideration is gen. @entity221 's request for an additional 40,000 @entity12 troops			1
@entity223 @entity32 : and remember @entity224 ? she 's the 17 year old who ran away from @entity227 to @entity228 after she accused her father of threatening her when she converted from @entity230 to @entity231			0
well , her father had denied that accusation , and a law enforcement report found no evidence of any criminal activity			0
the case ended up in court , where a judge ordered @entity239 , who you see here , and her parents to sit down and try to work out a solution			0
now , the judge says it 's in @entity224 's best interest for that process to take place in @entity227			0
so , once her immigration status is clarified , that 's where she 's heading			0
@entity239 's parents are happy about the ruling			0
they had asked for their daughter 's custody to be transferred back to @entity227			0
her attorney was against the move			0
@entity258 @entity259 , @entity26 : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs. @entity262 's government class at @entity263 in @entity264 , @entity265 ! what @entity268 position does @entity266 hold ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) secretary of agriculture , b ) secretary of energy , c ) secretary of labor or @entity277 ) secretary of transportation ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity266 became labor secretary earlier this year			0
before that , she served eight years in the @entity12 @entity280			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity18 @entity32 : we 're recognizing @entity285 as we wrap up our celebration of @entity18			1
she is the first @entity14 labor secretary and says it 's " a dream " to be serving in that role			0
@entity266 has more than two decades of public service			0
in that time , she 's put together a few firsts			0
you can see some right here			0
sec. @entity266 says one of her most important accomplishments was becoming the first person in her family to graduate from college			0
and that came after a counselor once told @entity266 ' mother that her daughter was n't college material			0
in a recent interview with @entity0 's @entity305 , @entity285 said more families need to understand the significance of getting a higher education			0
@entity266 , secretary of labor : it is important for that to kind of be a lesson for other people , to know that it is possible to have changes like that coming , maybe even influences from outside sources like a high school counselor who happened to take an interest in what i was doing and thought i was capable of going to college			0
@entity32 : during the interview , @entity266 said she wants to use her work with the @entity326 to improve the quality of life for everyone			0
@entity266 : i want to inform people about opportunities that the @entity326 can offer them			0
and i want to do that in a way that will impact the @entity336 community and other communities that are in great need right now			0
@entity14 @entity32 : meanwhile , the @entity16 hosted a fiesta this week			1
@entity14 featured artists with roots in @entity342			0
( begin video ) @entity12 president @entity209 : as we celebrate @entity18 , we are honored to be joined by some of this country 's most successful and innovative performers of latin music			1
although latin music takes many forms , this spirit of diversity also unifies us			0
latin music speaks to us in a language we can all understand , about hope and joy , sorrow and pain , friendship and love			0
it moves us , and it tends to make us move a little bit ourselves			1
( @entity364 ) latino in @entity342 @entity32 : how are @entity365 remaking @entity342 , and how is @entity342 remaking them ? that 's the focus of the new @entity0 documentary " @entity336 in @entity342			0
