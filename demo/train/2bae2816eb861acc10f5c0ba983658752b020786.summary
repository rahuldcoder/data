@entity0 -- weather has delayed the scheduled monday morning delivery of the final two sections of a 408 - foot spire to the top of @entity7 , according to the @entity8 and @entity9			1
the two sections were scheduled to be delivered to the roof deck , as long as weather allowed on monday			2
once they are installed , they will make the building the tallest in the @entity16 , according to the site 's management			1
the two pieces form a stainless steel beacon weighing almost six tons and will be the final piece put in place to give the building an iconic height of 1,776 feet , according to a news release from the @entity8 and @entity9			1
once the architectural structure is complete , it will be comprised of 18 separate sections of steel and three communication rings			0
the first -- and heaviest -- steel section was installed in january , weighing more than 67 tons , the news release said			0
@entity8 assistant director of media @entity31 said the original design included a radome -- short for radar dome -- but that was rejected because of anticipated servicing and maintenance difficulties			0
the radome would not have impacted the height , but would have provided an additional design element , which ultimately proved impractical , @entity31 told @entity1			0
the spire will serve a television broadcast facility housed in @entity7 , the press release said			2
while under construction , @entity7 became @entity0 's tallest building a year ago , standing 1,271 feet above street - level			1
the building then was 21 feet higher than the @entity48 's observation deck .			0

@entity7 will top out at 1,776 feet
construction *crews* were scheduled to bring up final two sections monday
