@entity0 -- the pictures told the story : vice president @entity4 looked solemn , patrician and in control as he sat at a long table in the @entity8 , flanked by people on both sides of the gun control issue			1
the images conveyed a sense that the @entity8 was in command on this issue			0
and that 's the point			0
historically , presidential administrations have used symbolic imagery — at times coupled with marginal actions — to shift public opinion or affect larger political or social change			1
" politics is a risk taking project , " said @entity23 , a @entity24 historian and @entity1 contributor			0
" they put together these commissions in response to some crisis			0
you try a hundred things and hope something works			0
" as @entity4 's gun control task force recommendations land on the desk of president @entity38 , political experts say it is important that his administration sends a clear signal that it has things in hand			1
@entity38 says gun lobby stokes fear of federal action that is especially critical in what will likely be an uphill battle to push specific changes , like an assault weapons ban , as part of a broader effort on gun control			1
the first move in the image battle will be to appear to move quickly and decisively			0
" you have to give the @entity38 administration credit for one thing : they 've learned from history to do things quickly , " @entity60 , director of the @entity62 's @entity61 , said of previous task force initiatives that fizzled			0
in 2010 , @entity38 appointed a bipartisan commission headed by former @entity68 sen. @entity68 of @entity69 and @entity70 , a former @entity71 @entity8 chief of staff , to come up with a proposal to balance the budget and cut the debt			0
like the gun task force , @entity75 reviewed current regulations , gathered input from the public and engaged in tense internal conversations			1
but after months of working on a proposal — a blend of steep revenue increases and spending cuts — the group struggled to agree to a solution			0
the president did not take up the recommendations			1
@entity38 largely avoided the issue of gun control during his first term			2
he wrote an opinion piece two months after the 2011 assassination attempt on rep. @entity94 of @entity95 , acknowledging the importance of the @entity98 right to bear arms			2
in the piece he also called for a focus on " effective steps that will actually keep those irresponsible , law - breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place			2
" @entity109 searches for answers a month later but in the aftermath of that shooting and as the election season loomed , the @entity111 backed off from a list of recommendations that included a measure designed to help keep mentally ill people from getting guns			2
for now , at least , there is a sense in @entity0 that the @entity109 , @entity122 , school shooting where 26 people -- 20 of them young children -- were slaughtered could lead to meaningful legislative reform			0
public opinion would seem to suggest that the @entity8 efforts are well timed			1
in the month since the massacre , a new poll showed the percentage of @entity131 who said they were dissatisfied with @entity131 's gun laws has spiked			2
the @entity135 survey released on monday showed 38 % of @entity131 were dissatisfied with current gun regulations , and wanted stricter laws			2
that represented 13 - point jump from one year ago , when 25 % expressed that view			0
" you want to strike while the iron is hot , " @entity60 said			0
" we @entity131 have short attention spans and , as horrible as the @entity109 shooting was , will anyone be surprised if we moved along by spring ? " the @entity8 has since worked overtime to show it considers gun control an urgent matter			2
the vice president has spent the last week meeting with what the @entity8 calls " stakeholders " in the gun control debate			1
on monday , @entity4 was to meet with members of a @entity8 @entity71 task force on guns , along with attorney general @entity157 , homeland security secretary @entity158 , and @entity159 , the secretary of health and human services			1
@entity162 background check : what does it mean ? in a series of face to face discussions on thursday , @entity4 sat down with the @entity167 and other gun owners groups before conferring with representatives from the film and television industry			1
in a sign the @entity8 is prepared to move aggressively on its proposals , @entity4 made public comments just before meeting with the @entity167 , the country 's most powerful gun lobby			1
" putting the vice president in charge of ( the task force ) and having him meeting with these groups is intended to show seriousness and an effort to reach out and respond to concerns and wishes of various groups , " said @entity177 , a political science professor at @entity178			1
still , the @entity167 expressed disappointment in its discussion with @entity4 and later released a statement that accused the administration of mounting " an agenda to attack the @entity98			1
" organizations seeking tougher gun control laws insist an assault weapons ban is critical to addressing the nation 's recent rash of mass shootings			0
however , such a ban could be difficult in a @entity200 mired in gridlock			0
" the bully pulpit is limited			0
it 's hard for the president to sustain that momentum , " @entity23 said of the @entity8 's gun control efforts after the @entity109 shootings			1
" the thing about symbolism is , like the shock over @entity109 , they fade quickly			0
" @entity109 opens eyes to other gun violence against young people @entity1 's @entity215 and @entity216 contributed to this report			1

gun violence recommendations are expected from vice president @entity4 on *tuesday*
the proposals are expected to contain *substantive* and symbolic ideas to curb gun violence
presidents use symbolism to shift public opinion or affect larger political or social change
