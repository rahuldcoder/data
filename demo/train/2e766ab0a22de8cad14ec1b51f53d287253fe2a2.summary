-- the clouds looked ominous in @entity2 , @entity3 , on wednesday afternoon			2
so instead of letting her 14 - year - old son , @entity5 , hang out at the skate park at @entity7 like he usually did when school let out , @entity4 decided to pick him up and bring him home			1
the military family had just moved off post , and mother and son were heading out of the gate to leave when they heard sirens			1
" we thought there was a thunderstorm warning , " she said			2
by the time they arrived home shortly after 4 p.m. , they heard the news : someone was on base shooting at people			1
@entity4 's husband , @entity28 capt. @entity27 , was still at work on @entity7			1
she tried to call him , but the phone lines were jammed			2
so she sent him a text			2
capt. @entity27 's first response -- " is @entity5 at the skate park ? " she assured him their son was safe			1
" good , " he texted			1
" i will contact you later			2
" this is what military families do during emergencies -- they handle the immediate needs and talk emotions later , she said			2
@entity27 texted her that the service members in his unit were all right , so she went into " key caller mode " and grabbed a roster of family contacts			1
the relatives were spread out around the country , so she had no problem calling them to tell them their loved ones were not harmed			2
then , @entity4 managed to have a talk with her teenager about what had happened just before it aired on the news			1
army spc. @entity59 had walked from one building to another on the @entity28 's largest post , firing a .45 - caliber handgun			1
he killed three people and wounded 16			1
the 34 - year - old , who had served in the @entity67 war , then shot himself to death in front of a military police officer who had confronted him			2
the situation was nerve - wracking , but @entity27 steeled herself			1
with a father who fought with a @entity76 unit and a mother who was a military nurse in @entity78 , she knows what it 's like to go on autopilot when something terrible happens			2
she said it 's crucial to turn to " certain protocols			2
" " there 's not a lot of time for emotion , at first			2
there will be later , there definitely will be later , " she said thursday			2
" i 'm sure i 'll have talks with the chaplain later and have my breakdown			2
" thursday morning , @entity5 did n't go to school			1
he 's a military kid , @entity4 said ; he 's always seen service members carrying guns			1
that is normal to him			0
he seemed to be ok , but was he really ? better that she be with him			0
her husband , however , went back to work thursday			1
" yes , it 's secure " less than five years ago , in november 2009 , maj. @entity102 killed 13 people and injured dozens at @entity7			1
in 2011 , @entity105 @entity106 was arrested after he tried to build a bomb to blow up @entity7 troops			1
a search of his hotel room revealed various items used to make bombs , including battery - operated clocks and a pressure cooker			0
a federal judge sentenced him to life in prison			1
considering this recent history , @entity0 asked @entity27 , did she have any concerns about security on post , whether anything that could have been different to prevent the shooting ? @entity27 laughed heartily			1
" are you kidding me ? " it 's very , very tight on @entity7 , she said			1
" every time you get on installation , you have to have the tag on the car scanned			0
they do it every time , every time you go through the gate			0
and then there are random checks , " she said			0
" yes , it 's secure			0
" @entity7 is the nation 's largest @entity28 post , covering 340 square miles			1
it is home to more than 45,000 assigned soldiers and nearly 9,000 civilian employees , according to the post 's official website			1
compare @entity7 to cities its size , @entity27 said , and the violence there does n't feel especially alarming			1
changes after @entity102 massacre in the wake of the 2009 massacre , authorities launched various investigations and reviews			0
" the tragic shooting of @entity163 military personnel at @entity7 in november 2009 underscored the need for the @entity165 to thoroughly review its approach to force protection , " defense secretary @entity158 wrote in a memo shortly after that shooting			1
a series of changes were put in place			0
a kind of " neighborhood watch " was created to teach the @entity28 community to recognize and report suspicious behavior			1
@entity175 also called for a plan to educate commanders on signs of workplace violence and an enhanced 911 systems on military installations to enable emergency dispatchers to effectively determine a caller 's location			0
other recommendations included upgrading health care to service members and hiring additional providers , especially in mental health , to help meet that goal			0
still , at least some soldiers at @entity7 feel more needs to be done			1
" this place is definitely a black hole			0
this place is a stressful place , " a soldier , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , told @entity0 's @entity197			1
" until we have people step up and see , hey , there needs to be change here , we 're going to continue to have incidents like this			1
" " people in jail have a better life than a lot of these soldiers here -- and if you do n't have a family , and you 're a single soldier living in the barracks , it can be miserable , " the @entity204 said			1
" nobody really understands how bad somebody 's mental stability is , or how hard it is to keep your sanity here being at @entity7			1
" @entity0 asked @entity163 sen. @entity220 , @entity221 , to respond to the remarks on friday , shortly after @entity220 visited some of the wounded			0
" now is not the time to talk about public policy , " @entity220 said			0
a soldier suffering @entity59 was being evaluated for post-traumatic stress disorder and going through the process required to diagnose the disorder			1
he had not been diagnosed with @entity230 , said lt. gen. @entity231 , the post 's commander			2
@entity59 had suffered from depression , anxiety and other psychiatric complaints and was receiving treatment and taking medication			0
officials are trying to piece together what in his background and medical treatment may have triggered the violence			0
@entity59 was transferred to @entity7 from another base in february			1
his former base was not identified			0
retired army maj. gen. @entity245 , a @entity0 analyst , expressed surprise at the transfer			0
@entity59 should have remained at the other base for continuity of care , he said			0
@entity231 said , " we will have to re-examine all of those programs to see if there were any gaps			0
" in the wake of the 2009 bloodshed , other measures were taken			0
investigators said the @entity28 had to transform how it protects its soldiers , collects information about internal threats and communicates with the @entity262 and terrorism experts			1
but to residents like @entity27 and others , the changes have n't been obvious			1
" there has n't been a whole lot of extra protection on base , " said @entity267 , who lives on @entity7			1
@entity267 said authorities check identification and other things , but there has been no visible extra security			2
massacre site to be torn down guns on base @entity59 used a .45 - caliber @entity281 pistol that he recently purchased in the area but did not register on post			2
@entity28 regulations enacted in 1993 tightened gun restrictions , including a ban on carrying personal firearms on base			1
in september 2013 , republicans in the @entity290 introduced legislation to repeal the ban			0
@entity3 rep. @entity292 was one of seven republicans who proposed the @entity294 , saying the bill would help thwart mass shootings on bases			0
authorities will look at what , if anything , they could have done differently			0
that might be an uphill challenge			0
" @entity7 , tens of thousands of people come and go from that every day , " said @entity304 correspondent @entity303			1
" they have stickers in their cars ; they have permits to get on base			0
they are waved through a gate , because traffic has to keep flowing			0
" " if they are permitted onto the base because they have the right paperwork on any given day -- it is not likely that their cars will be searched every time they go in and out			0
it is assumed that they are acting appropriately and acting legally			0
that 's just the way the reality is			0
" retired gen. @entity327 , who was once an assistant division commander at @entity7 , said " military posts are our sanctuary			1
" " it 's a place where you 're not carrying a weapon 24 hours a day			0
it 's meant and designed to give you a sense of security where you can relax in a family environment			2
so , when this happens , it breaks the sacred trust			0
" ' getting help helps ' @entity342 retired from the @entity28 in 2004			1
he spent more than 10 years living and working on @entity7 and was there during the 2009 massacre			1
he 's a current leader with @entity67 and @entity344			0
" the 2009 shooting is still very raw , " he said			0
" and now here 's another one			0
you just do n't know what that 's going to do to people			1
" @entity342 said he had his " own little moment " wednesday night			0
" it does bring back those feelings of last time , " he said			2
" something about listening to the medical press conferences -- it was a bit overwhelming			0
i had to step out of the room			0
" he said he was worried some people might be overcome by the experience and feel like there is nothing they can do			2
@entity342 urged anyone in that situation to reach out , citing a 24/7 veterans crisis line			0
" there are people there that can help , " he said			2
" if you 're feeling bad , getting help helps			0
" @entity0 's @entity372 contributed to this report .			0
