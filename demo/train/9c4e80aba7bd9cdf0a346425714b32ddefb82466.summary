-- last weekend 's release and the now imminent homecoming of @entity4 sgt. @entity3 , held prisoner by the @entity6 or its allies for nearly five years , are cause for celebration			1
@entity3 was the only @entity10 soldier being held in the @entity12 war			1
the @entity10 military does not abandon its own			2
@entity3 's release is nonetheless controversial because of the price paid for it : our release of five former @entity6 leaders from @entity21 to @entity22 , where , we are told , they will be monitored and barred from leaving that small @entity23 for one year			1
there is no denying that the release of @entity6 murderers was a stiff price to pay			2
letting them go ( albeit after a dozen years of incarceration at @entity21 ) was necessary , the administration says , because otherwise sgt. @entity3 's life was in danger			1
if @entity37 , knowing of an imminent threat to his life , had chosen simply to let one of our soldiers die , how would the @entity10 public react ? granted , the objections to this prisoner swap are not trivial			2
on balance , though , the administration made the right call			2
one objection is that the released @entity6 prisoners , who have killed before , are likely to kill again , once they return to @entity12 in one year ( assuming they do not slip away from @entity22 even sooner )			2
that is possible -- but not a certainty			0
both the @entity12 and @entity10 governments have been trying to encourage peace negotiations with the @entity6			1
admittedly , a peace deal faces long odds			0
still , there is a degree of speculation as to whether the @entity6 prisoners -- after long years in @entity21 away from their comrades -- will necessarily return to their old ways			1
in contrast , we are told -- on what classified basis we do not yet know -- that @entity3 's life was in imminent danger , if the @entity66 and @entity67 had refused to make the swap			0
and even if @entity3 had survived , how many more years of incommunicado imprisonment would he have had to endure ? with @entity10 forces in @entity12 set to wind down to only 10,000 by the end of 2014 , and to leave the country altogether by the end of 2016 , @entity10 leverage to secure his release was steadily diminishing			1
another objection is that the @entity10 , as a matter of policy , should never negotiate with terrorists			0
in general that is a sound policy			0
but the @entity6 are not garden variety terrorists			0
they are an armed force with which the @entity10 has been engaged in armed conflict for over a decade			0
@entity3 was not a hostage held by ordinary terrorists			0
he was a soldier captured in war			0
the @entity10 can make deals to secure the return of prisoners without relinquishing our general policy of not negotiating with terrorists			2
a further objection is that this deal will encourage the @entity6 to capture more @entity10 soldiers			1
but the @entity6 need no incentives to try to capture @entity10 service members			1
any chance they get , they will take -- regardless of how the @entity10 dealt with the @entity3 release			1
finally , some @entity104 in @entity105 object that the deal was illegal , because the administration is required by statute to give @entity105 30 days notice before transferring prisoners from @entity21 , but failed to do so			1
the administration counters that there was no time for delay without risking @entity3 's life , and that in these circumstances , the president 's constitutional powers as commander in chief entitled him to override the statute			2
although the point is debatable as a matter of law , in my view the administration wins the argument			0
aside from the prisoner swap for @entity3 , there remains a larger question : is the continued detention of 149 prisoners at @entity21 ( following the release of the five @entity6 ) in the national security interest of the @entity10 ? sixty or so are @entity135 who have long been cleared for release , because they are deemed not to pose a threat to the @entity10 the administration keeps them in @entity21 only because of unrest in @entity135			1
other prisoners are detained indefinitely , with no prospect for trial or release			0
still other prisoners , who face criminal charges , are or will be tried by military commissions that fall short of minimum international standards of fair trial			0
both as symbol and in substance , @entity21 thus remains a gaping wound in @entity10 credibility			1
when we criticize @entity159 or @entity160 for violating international law , each has a ready retort : the @entity10 violates international law at @entity21			1
even our allies see us as hypocrites			0
at a time when our " hard power " is in decline , in both absolute terms ( a shrinking military ) and relative terms ( versus mounting @entity160 power ) , @entity21 undermines @entity10 " soft power " -- when we need it more than ever			2
@entity21 has too long been treated as a domestic political football			0
it is past time to recognize that the price of continuing this game into overtime is too high .			0

@entity180 : the objections to the @entity3 deal raise serious issues
he says negotiating with the @entity6 , which was holding @entity3 , made sense
@entity180 : administration was *justified* in not complying with requirement to notify @entity105
he says @entity21 remains a gaping wound in @entity10 credibility internationally
