@entity0 has again appealed to @entity3 's new president to spare two of its citizens who face execution by firing squad			1
the appeal came after president @entity10 rejected a plea for clemency from 31 - year - old @entity13 , the ringleader of a failed bid to smuggle more than eight kilograms of heroin to @entity0 in 2005			1
@entity10 had already turned down an appeal for clemency from @entity18 , @entity13 's collaborator in the scheme , which included seven other people who are serving lengthy prison sentences			1
together they are known as the " @entity24 9			0
" " while @entity0 respects @entity3 's sovereignty , we are asking that @entity3 reconsider its decision to execute two @entity0 citizens , " @entity0 prime minister @entity25 said in statement			1
" both men are reformed characters and both have helped to rehabilitate other prisoners			0
the prerogative of mercy should be extended to them			0
" for the last 10 years , the pair has fought a lengthy legal battle , first to avoid conviction against charges and later to reduce the severity of their sentences			2
the @entity24 9 were arrested in april 2005 after @entity3 police received a tip - off from @entity47			1
they caught four at the @entity50 airport with more than eight kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies			2
another four -- including @entity18 -- were arrested at a hotel in the village of @entity56			1
@entity13 was detained after a boarding a plane to @entity59 -- he was n't carrying any drugs but was named by others as the mastermind of the plot			2
during their 10 years of imprisonment , supporters say @entity13 and @entity18 have changed their ways and are now working within the prison to help other inmates			1
lawyers had hoped their rehabilitation would count in their favor , but their failed clemency bids have reinforced efforts to pursue other legal avenues			0
@entity13 's lawyers are said to be seeking to reopen the case , a controversial move that faces legal resistance from @entity3 's @entity79 , according to @entity3 law expert @entity80			1
currently , the @entity81 allows an unlimited number of applications to reopen a case -- the @entity79 does not			0
" there 's a dispute between the two courts at the moment			0
there 've been attempts to bring them together to work out a resolution			0
it has n't been successful			0
so as it stands , the @entity81 says this application is acceptable and the @entity79 says it 's not , " @entity80 told the @entity93			0
@entity3 has long taken a tough line on drug smugglers and @entity10 has made it clear he does n't intend to introduce a policy of leniency			2
last week , six prisoners were killed by firing squad , including five foreigners from @entity103 , the @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			0
@entity103 's president @entity108 issued a statement saying the execution of one of her countrymen had " severely affected " relations with @entity3			2
@entity0 's @entity25 says in the best interests of @entity13 and @entity18 , the government will make no further public comments but its " support will continue			1
