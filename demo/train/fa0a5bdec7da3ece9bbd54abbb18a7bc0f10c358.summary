@entity39 was infected with the same parasite a couple of weeks ago and was at @entity44 in @entity45			1

@entity122 in @entity45 is the most likely source of @entity39 's infection , the @entity40 @entity1 said			1
another case of the same parasite was reported in 2010 and was possibly linked to @entity122 , a three - acre sand - bottom , spring - fed lake			0
