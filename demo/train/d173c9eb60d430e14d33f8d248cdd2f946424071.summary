the promise of $ 60 billion can do a lot to calm outrage			0
that point was underscored wednesday , when @entity5 leaders met with irate representatives from @entity7 and @entity8 who felt they had been ignored by @entity5 speaker @entity10 when he scrapped a planned vote late tuesday on a massive aid package for @entity14 victims			1
" we 're getting what @entity7 and @entity8 need , and that 's all that counts , " rep. @entity15 , @entity16 - @entity7 , told reporters after emerging from a 20 - minute meeting with @entity10 and @entity5 majority leader @entity19			1
" we 're all big boys ; we understand that all that counts is the bottom line			2
" a vote on $ 9 billion for immediate aid is now set for friday , with the balance of $ 51 billion due for consideration january 15			2
opinion : @entity30 drops bomb on @entity33 leaders for its part , the @entity36 plans to vote by unanimous consent on friday on the $ 9 billion but is waiting to see what is in the larger package before announcing a plan for that , a @entity36 @entity35 leadership aide said			2
" on the second tranche , we will need to see more details before we decide how to proceed , " the aide said			0
" as the @entity36 has shown by passing our bipartisan bill , we consider getting aid to the victims of @entity14 a superlative priority , but we need to know more about the contents of the bill before deciding on a path forward			1
" democrats were less mollified			0
" while it would have been far better had they passed the @entity36 's bill today , at least this provides a path to produce the needed $ 60 billion for @entity7 and @entity8 by the end of the month , " said sen. @entity55 , @entity56 - @entity7 , in a statement			1
" it 's really unbelievable how @entity10 and his party could just walk away , " said @entity63 , speaker of the @entity64			1
" to promise us a vote weeks from now ? why should we believe him at all ? it 's just shocking			0
" in a statement , @entity10 and @entity19 said " critical aid " to storm victims should be the first priority of the new @entity72 , which convenes thursday			1
the comity contrasted sharply with the outrage that had exploded earlier in the day over @entity72 ' inaction on the package , pitting even fellow republicans against @entity10			2
it was " disappointing and disgusting to watch , " said @entity8 gov. @entity30 , blaming " the toxic internal politics of the @entity5 majority			1
" " @entity8 deserves better than the duplicity we saw on display , " he said , adding , " shame on @entity72			2
" @entity30 , a @entity33 , said he had tried to reach @entity10 on tuesday night after the latter canceled a vote on the aid bill , which had already been approved by the @entity36			1
" he did not take my calls , " said @entity30			0
in a news conference , @entity30 said he joined people of his state in feeling " betrayed " and added that the move summarizes " why the @entity95 people hate @entity72			0
" in a statement , @entity30 and @entity7 gov. @entity96 wrote : " this failure to come to the aid of @entity95 following a severe and devastating natural disaster is unprecedented			2
the fact that days continue to go by while people suffer , families are out of their homes , and men and women remain jobless and struggling during these harsh winter months is a dereliction of duty			0
" @entity33 reverse earlier outrage , pledge to back @entity10 @entity10 did not make public remarks and did not post about the issue on social media			1
@entity33 leadership sources said @entity10 was worried it would be a bad political move for him to allow a vote on the new federal spending after a long day of getting pummeled by his own @entity116 for not demanding enough spending cuts in the fiscal cliff bill			1
@entity119 was restored late in the afternoon			0
" as far as i 'm concerned , that was a lifetime ago , " @entity15 said			2
" i know it was last night , but the bottom line is we 're going forward getting what we believe is necessary			0
" earlier , @entity15 had slammed his own party			2
" the @entity33 has said it 's the party of ' family values			0
' last night , it turned its back on the most essential value of all , and that 's to provide food , shelter , clothing and relief for people who have been hit by a natural disaster , " @entity15 told @entity127			1
@entity15 said he chased @entity10 " all over the @entity5 last night " and that @entity10 had said everything would be taken care of after the vote on the fiscal cliff			1
@entity15 called the @entity5 leadership 's move a " knife in the back			1
" " anyone from @entity7 or @entity8 who contributes one penny to the @entity147 should have their head examined , " @entity15 said			1
it 's very rare for a lawmaker to call on anyone not to support his own party			0
new @entity72 tackles old leftovers but on wednesday afternoon , @entity15 said he would vote for @entity10 in leadership elections scheduled for thursday			1
a senior @entity33 leadership aide said @entity10 will make a @entity14 aid package " his first priority in the new @entity72 , " which begins its term thursday			1
when a new @entity72 begins , both chambers have to begin from scratch with legislation , so the @entity36 's passage of a previous bill will be moot			0
@entity163 , @entity10 's spokesman , said the speaker is " committed to getting this bill passed this month			1
" before the @entity5 adjourned wednesday , president @entity166 urged a vote			1
" it has only been two months since @entity14 devastated communities across @entity7 , @entity8 , and @entity169 as well as other eastern states			1
our citizens are still trying to put their lives back together , " @entity166 said in a statement			1
" when tragedy strikes , @entity95 come together to support those in need			0
i urge republicans in the @entity5 to do the same , bring this important request to a vote today , and pass it without delay for our fellow @entity95 , " @entity166 said			1
some of the harshest comments came from @entity15			2
@entity184 , vice president of @entity7 's @entity185 , told @entity127 , " the money was needed yesterday , and the fact that there 's an obstacle in the way for whatever reason and a vote was n't allowed to go forward was inexcusable			1
" the money would improve the city 's ability to withstand damage from winter storms , @entity184 said			0
fiscal cliff battle held up the measure the tumultuous process of getting the fiscal cliff deal passed in the @entity5 had held up the relief measure , and many @entity116 opposed the size of the @entity36 bill			2
" leadership was all - consumed with the cliff procedure , " @entity204 told reporters off the @entity5 floor late tuesday			0
" and they really have not had the time to devote to this because of that			0
" @entity36 passes @entity14 aid bill @entity14 killed at least 113 people in the @entity95 and left millions of people without power after running up the @entity215 in late october			0
the storm hit hardest in @entity7 and @entity8			1
@entity96 has put storm - related costs at $ 41.9 billion , while @entity30 has estimated a price tag of $ 36.8 billion			0
the bill includes grant funding for owners of homes and businesses , as well as funding for public improvement projects on the electrical grid , hospitals and transit systems to prevent damage from future storms			0
@entity232 , a resident of @entity7 's @entity233 , owned two homes before the storm			2
one was destroyed ; the other was so severely flooded that it remains unlivable			0
but he expressed no anger over the @entity5 's decision			0
" they 'll just have to do it all over again , i suppose			0
what can you say ? " " it 's a lot of money , " he said , adding " there 's a lot of other things they 've got to do			0
" he tends to vote @entity33 and does n't plan to turn away from the party , he said , although , he added , " i do n't give them much money anyway			0
