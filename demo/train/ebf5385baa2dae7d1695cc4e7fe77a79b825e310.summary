@entity1 fought to the limit of his endurance in many epic bouts			1
the @entity14 - born @entity13 captured world titles at super featherweight and junior welterweight during his 16 - year - professional career and also fought and lost to legends @entity19 and @entity20 in big money matches			1

despite @entity1 's winning the @entity42 junior welterweight crown the following year by beating @entity43 of @entity14 to the vacant title , his storied wins over @entity8 proved to be the high point of @entity1 's career			1

it ended a 49 - fight career with 31 knockout and nine defeats			0
his first world title had come with victory over @entity70 , the adopted son of heavyweight great @entity71 , to claim the @entity73 super featherweight crown			0
as his fame spread and with countless nominations for @entity76 's @entity27 , @entity1 , nicknamed " @entity1 , " gained a large and devoted following among boxing fans			0
but his life outside the ring proved contentious and in march this year the @entity81 reported that @entity1 was charged with assaulting his then girlfriend @entity82 and spent two nights in jail after failing to turn up for a court appearance			2
