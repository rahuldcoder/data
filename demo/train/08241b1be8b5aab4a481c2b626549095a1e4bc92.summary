-- despite president @entity3 's signing of a law repealing the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy , defense secretary @entity1 sent a memo to troops warning them that it remains in effect until 60 days after the government certifies that the military is ready for implementation			1
the @entity15 says it does not know how long the certification process may take			0
in the meantime , @entity1 is essentially telling gays and lesbians serving in the military not to come out until 60 days after that determination is made			1
" in order to prevent any confusion , i want to be perfectly clear : at this time , there are no new changes to any existing department or service policies , " said the memo , released thursday			0
" service members who alter their personal conduct during this period may face adverse consequences , " @entity1 wrote			1
before the ban is completely lifted , the president , the secretary of defense and the chairman of the @entity35 will have to certify that the repeal can move ahead without negatively affecting unit cohesion and military readiness			1
since october , the military has dismissed at least eight service members for violations of the policy , according to @entity15 spokesman col. @entity45			0
but @entity45 said those dismissals had been approved prior to oct. 21 , when @entity1 tightened the rules about who in the @entity15 can dismiss a service member for violating the policy			2
now , only the civilian service secretaries , in consultation with the @entity15 's top lawyer and head of personnel , can order dismissals			0
no new cases have resulted in dismissals since then			0
@entity1 also said he now endorses all the recommendations of the @entity15 's working group on " do n't ask , do n't tell " as the road map for implementation			1
