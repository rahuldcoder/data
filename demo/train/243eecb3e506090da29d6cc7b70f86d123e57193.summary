-- @entity2 ' personal life went off the rails			0
@entity5 's sporting image crashed in drugs			0
both were sponsored by @entity8 in multi-million dollar deals			1
now @entity8 is being reminded again that pinning your company reputation on star names is a risky business			1
this time it 's @entity16 whose life has moved from sports headlines to the news pages to cause headaches at @entity8 headquarters			1
@entity16 , known as the ' blade runner , ' is the man @entity8 called a bullet and who is now charged with shooting his girlfriend , @entity24			1
with @entity16 , @entity8 had a star able to attract supporters to disabled athletics and who was so fast he could compete against able - bodied runners			1
and @entity8 knew how to market that appeal -- with an ad in 2011 that showed the sprinter starting from blocks and the caption " i am the bullet in the chamber " together with @entity8 's " just do it " slogan and logo			1
@entity39 , founder of @entity40 , which advises companies on maintaining their reputations , said there was a deep conversation taking place in marketing about how to avoid such advertising ricochets with forward thinking and less @entity49 ©			0
he said : " double entendres , sexual references and phrases that include violence are being looked at for exactly this reason			0
a bullet in the chamber still represents a gun and a gun represents a weapon			2
" @entity39 said a brand hit by a scandal surrounding a sponsor approach should aim to move on			0
" the problem is that so much money is pinned on human beings who in a moment of passion or intoxication , can ruin their reputation in an instant			0
" it is not the responsibility of @entity8 to be a parent or rescue a person if they break the law			1
" these athletes have certain qualities that a brand emulates but at the moment they are harming the brand ... they have to cut the association quickly and move on			1
" he added that there would be clauses in the @entity8 contract that make clear when the athlete 's behavior can allow the company to cut its ties -- and law - breaking would often be among the reasons			1
opinion : @entity16 case and the plague of violence against women many companies look at widening a campaign beyond the pulling power of the celebrity but so far playing out , in the planning stages of a campaign , " what if " a worst - case scenario happens is not common practice			2
another industry executive said celebrities should not be used as the focus of a campaign but as a way of introducing a wider campaign issue			0
that way , if the star derails , the wider campaign can continue			0
@entity8 issued a statement soon after @entity24 's death expressing " sympathy and condolences to the families concerned following this tragic incident			2
" on sunday , @entity16 ' management company announced that @entity16 had pulled out of five contracted race meets , but that his sponsors were standing by him			2
" i can confirm that at this point in time , all parties are supportive and their contractual commitments are maintained			0
they have said they are happy to let the legal process takes its course before making any change in their position , " said his agent @entity129 in a statement			0
the 26 - year - old @entity139 double amputee sprinter was officially charged with killing @entity24 on friday			0
prosecutors said they plan to argue that the attack was premeditated			0
@entity16 rejects the murder allegation " in the strongest terms , " @entity142 said			2
it is not the first time @entity8 has sponsored a scandal - hit star			1
@entity2 was a @entity8 man when details of his numerous affairs became public			2
@entity8 stood with @entity5 throughout his career until the @entity151 came up with enough evidence to convince the world of his cheating			2
marketing specialist @entity156 said @entity8 should do something immediately such as suspending its relationship with @entity16 because of the severity of the accusations against him			1
@entity39 said a brand used to like having just one person represent it , but those days are gone , and deals are struck with many athletes -- from both sexes , from across races and from across national regions and from different countries			0
in this marketing world , @entity39 said , with many athletes sponsored by and representing @entity8 , it is also easier to shake off the bad publicity when a star falls .			1
