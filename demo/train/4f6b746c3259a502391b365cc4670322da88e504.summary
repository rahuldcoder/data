-- it has been 17 years since @entity2 had a president from the left , but that might be about to change			1
@entity6 , a candidate from the center - left @entity7 , has significant momentum after edging center - right incumbent @entity10 in the first round of @entity2 's presidential election on sunday			1
if he wins a may 6 runoff against @entity10 , @entity6 would be the first left - wing president since @entity14 in 1995			1
@entity10 is seeking his second five - year term , following @entity16 , who served 12 years in office			2
@entity10 received 27.2 % of the vote in the first round of voting on sunday , just behind @entity6 's 28.6 %			1
as the @entity2 prepare for the runoff , here are a few key points to keep in mind : 1			1
this is a two - horse race , but other candidates matter			2
ten candidates , spanning the entire political spectrum , took part in the first round of voting			2
but opinion polls always pointed to a runoff between @entity10 and @entity6			1
( in @entity2 , a presidential candidate must receive more than 50 % of the vote to win office			1
if no one claims a majority in the first round of voting -- and no one ever has , in the current system -- the top two vote - getters advance to a second round of voting			0
) but even with the predictable @entity10 - @entity6 finish , it was still important to see how many votes the other candidates received			1
that 's because those votes are now up for grabs in the runoff			2
" the other candidates have to be given some attention because they exert an influence in the race , " said @entity50 , who teaches a course about the election at the @entity53 in @entity54			1
finishing behind @entity6 and @entity10 were two extreme candidates : @entity59 on the far right and @entity60 on the far left			1
@entity61 , daughter of 2002 presidential finalist @entity63 , finished third with 17.9 % of the vote			2
@entity60 finished fourth with 11.1 %			0
their strong showings might cause @entity6 to tack more to the left and @entity10 more to the right before the runoff			1
" if you 're coming out of the first round with 27 % , 28 % , you need to make it to 50 %			0
so you have to think of where you are going to make up that difference to prevail in the final round , " @entity50 said			0
a day after the first round , @entity10 said he has a " duty to listen " to far - right voters after @entity61 's third - place finish			1
" we must respect the voters ' will , " he said			0
2012 a year of elections : return of the @entity84 ? 2			0
one issue stands out among the rest			0
the economy dominates the political agenda in @entity2 , much as it does in @entity89			0
" basically for months now , the top issues have been unemployment and purchasing power , " said @entity90 , @entity0 's correspondent in @entity91			0
jobs have been difficult to come by , especially for young people , and that is one of the main reasons that @entity10 is vulnerable			0
" even though some people would give @entity10 high marks for doing the kinds of things that might have a positive long - term effect on the economy -- like raising the retirement age to put the system on sounder fiscal footing -- he has n't been successful in bringing jobs back , " @entity50 said			0
comparing @entity10 and @entity6 on their economic policy is not unlike comparing @entity112 and @entity113 in the @entity89			1
" @entity6 is in favor of more government action to stimulate the economy , stimulate spending ... whereas @entity10 wants to improve the climate for business by lowering some taxes , by talking about repealing the law establishing the 35 - hour work week -- a @entity7 measure from the late ' 90s -- to make it possible to work more , " @entity50 said			1
" it 's more of a private - sector approach			0
@entity2 and @entity89 have more in common than just high unemployment			1
immigration , race and the assimilation of @entity2 's large @entity133 community have been prominent issues leading up to the election , even before the march shootings by an @entity138 extremist in @entity139 and @entity140			1
@entity10 has been tough on immigration			2
last year , a law went into effect banning @entity138 face coverings in public places , the so - called burqa ban			0
and in a recent television interview , @entity10 said @entity2 has " too many foreigners " and that the country is not integrating them properly			1
@entity10 won the 2007 election by taking a strong stance on race , according to political analyst @entity154 from the @entity155			1
but @entity61 , this year 's far - right candidate , said @entity10 has n't been strong enough while in office			2
" @entity61 is saying the original is better than the copy , and that voters should not believe @entity10 on race , " he told @entity0			2
the election 's result could affect the eurozone			2
@entity10 has worked closely with @entity165 chancellor @entity164 throughout the @entity167 debt crisis , leading the way for strict austerity measures in @entity170 and other troubled countries			2
would @entity6 's election encourage a change in strategy ? " there is concern that , within the eurozone , @entity6 's election could create greater instability , " @entity50 said			1
" he 's talked about renegotiating some of the accords that have been reached -- at the instigation of @entity10 and @entity164 -- to ensure greater stability in the eurozone			2
" the reason is long - term growth			0
" i think some of the @entity2 like the way ( @entity10 ) handled -- with @entity164 -- the agreement in december to get more rigor , more austerity into @entity167 budgets			1
but then @entity6 and other economists are saying we also need growth , and these plans are going to absolutely stifle growth , " said @entity190 , a @entity2 professor at @entity191 near @entity192 , @entity193			1
like @entity50 , he is teaching a course on the election			0
@entity2 's own debt is also a concern			1
like the @entity89 , the country recently had its @entity203 credit rating downgraded			0
@entity6 has promised to create tens of thousands of public - sector jobs and raise taxes on the rich to pay for them			0
but some are concerned that might encourage the rich to just leave @entity2			0
" there 's some feeling that if @entity6 is elected , the attack on the @entity2 sovereign debt could be quite serious , " @entity209 said			1
" and this is what @entity10 has been saying : ' if you elect @entity6 , we 're going to be losing more than our aaa			1
we 'll be going down even further			0
@entity219 relations should remain strong			0
@entity6 has pledged to remove @entity2 troops from @entity221 by the end of this year if he is elected			1
whether it 's a realistic goal or not , that could create some tension between @entity91 and @entity225			0
but @entity6 is known for being a no - nonsense pragmatist			0
" @entity6 knows that he needs the @entity89 and that the @entity89 needs @entity167 , so i think there would be a great deal of cooperation there , " @entity209 said			0
@entity209 recalled @entity14 's election in 1981 and how there were initial concerns about him			0
" everyone said , ' oh , he 's got four @entity236 in his government , this is going to be the end of the relationship with the @entity89			0
' but it turns out that he was a very strong defender of @entity89 missiles in @entity165 , for example , " @entity209 said			0
" @entity14 's friendship with ( chancellor ) @entity246 , it was a strong @entity2 - @entity165 relationship , and ( @entity89 president @entity249 ) @entity248 and @entity14 did n't get along too badly despite their ideological differences			2

@entity2 's presidential election is set for a runoff to take place on sunday , may 6
incumbent @entity10 finished behind @entity6 in the first round
a couple of extreme candidates , one far left and one far right , could still affect the outcome
unemployment is the biggest issue in the race , but immigration and debt are also talking points
