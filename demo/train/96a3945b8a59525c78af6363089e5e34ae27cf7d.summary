-- how loud was @entity1 listening last night , blasted from the loading dock of westside @entity4 's @entity3 ? so loud that @entity5 heard it			1
so loud that my kidneys are still vibrating			2
so loud that even the @entity10 dudes were like " @entity11 , maybe turn it down to eight and a half ? " it felt like something between lying directly beneath a jet path and getting into a slap bet with @entity18 — and mostly , it was glorious			0
it was also , for the most part , very very dark			0
or as a friend turned and said to me : " when did @entity22 discover @entity23 ? " at times , the whole night felt a little bit like that opening scene in @entity28 ( cue the blood sprinklers ! )			1
but it was also just a party , with an open bar and dancing and a lot of complicated handshakes between old friends and scenester acquaintances			1
and ' @entity22 's full @entity39 roster of famous fans came out : @entity41 and @entity42 were there , glowing with the light of a thousand suns ; so were lesser celestial bodies like @entity47 , @entity48 , and @entity49 , plus a towering crew of flamingo - like models and professional athletes			1
@entity0 : @entity53 , day 3 - @entity22 debuts new songs , disses radio , demands croissants after an hour ( only an hour ! ) of milling around in @entity61 's dim , cavernous space , the crowd turned to find ' @entity22 himself onstage , delivering an impassioned , rambling , and sometimes impenetrable introduction — there was a lot of talk of artistry and marketing ( " i got a new strategy , it 's called no strategy			1
i have a plan to sell more music , it 's called ' make better music			0
' " ) and something about @entity69 and @entity71 's clothing lines — before he wrapped with " i had to learn about giving , this whole album is about giving ... this whole process is about giving ... no f -- @entity78			2
" touché ! go home , kumbaya			0
@entity0 : @entity82 , the creator under fire after on - stage rant in @entity84 this blog post is n't an album review ; our writer @entity87 will be delivering that next tuesday , or sooner if the record officially leaks			2
but i will say that from two listenings , this definitely feels like his darker , @entity95 , @entity96			0
some technical details : @entity22 revealed that @entity98 are on " three or four " tracks ; @entity100 and @entity103 's @entity101 and @entity102 also appear ; it was hard to catch titles beyond already - known ones like " i am a @entity107 , " " ca n't handle my liquor , " " @entity109 , " and " @entity110 " ( featuring @entity111 ) , but one that appeared to borrow samples from both @entity116 's " @entity115 " and @entity118 's haunting lynching ballad " @entity119 " will almost definitely be a talking point when it goes wider			1
is this record going to be all over the radio ? are these let - the - alpine - blast summer jams ? not in @entity125 in 2013 , no. but it still sounds — if i could actually hear anything this morning besides a faint post-show mosquito buzz — like a pretty fascinating manifestation of what goes on inside the mind of one of pop music 's most confounding , singular , and totally gonzo talents			0
@entity1 ! he is risen			1
