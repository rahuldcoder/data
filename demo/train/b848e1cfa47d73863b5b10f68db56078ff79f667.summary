@entity0 -- in a move likely to reignite the political battle over judges , president @entity2 on thursday renominated 33 people to the federal courts , including a @entity9 lawyer twice blocked by @entity10 worried she would be an " activist " on the bench			1
@entity12 was one of two nominees named again by @entity2 to the @entity14 , seen by many as a professional steppingstone to the @entity17			2
@entity12 is currently general counsel for the @entity18 in @entity9			0
she would fill the seat vacated by @entity20 , who joined the @entity17 as chief justice in 2005			0
in his announcement , @entity2 said his nominees should have been given up - or - down @entity25 votes before the 112th @entity26 adjourned			1
" several have been awaiting a vote for more than six months , even though they all enjoy bipartisan support			0
i continue to be grateful for their willingness to serve and remain confident that they will apply the law with the utmost impartiality and integrity , " he said			0
" i urge the @entity25 to consider and confirm these nominees without delay , so all @entity38 can have equal and timely access to justice			1
" by law , the president must resubmit nominations that did not receive floor action in the previous session of @entity26			2
@entity47 chairman @entity46 , @entity48 , last week urged @entity10 not to stop @entity2 's pending nominations			1
" there are more judicial vacancies now - 75 - than when president @entity2 was sworn into office four years ago , " said @entity46			2
" the nominations of too many qualified judicial nominees have needlessly languished on the @entity25 calendar			1
" chief justice laments ' fiscal cliff ' effects on federal courts in a rare move , @entity25 @entity10 voted in december 2011 to block @entity12 the first time she was tapped for the court , complaining the 46 - year - old @entity65 native was too liberal and would be an activist on the bench			1
@entity68 leader @entity68 said at the time that @entity12 met the " extraordinary circumstances " standard for a filibuster under a 2005 @entity25 agreement that allowed filibusters of judicial nominees only in extreme cases			1
@entity76 complained about @entity12 's legal positions on gun rights , detainee rights , and immigration and said she would bring an activist agenda to the court			0
@entity83 had defended @entity12 as a " superbly qualified nominee , " in the words of @entity46			0
sen. @entity86 , @entity87 - @entity9 , called her a moderate and said @entity10 have distorted her record			0
@entity12 's 2012 renomination languished without action , typical of an election year , when confirmations for a variety of political and practical reasons are given a lower legislative priority			0
also renominated for the @entity14 is @entity96 , the principal deputy solicitor general at the @entity97 , who has argued more than 20 cases before the @entity17			0
he would be the appeals court 's first @entity99 , if confirmed			0
republicans had been criticized for delaying floor votes on many nominees in the president 's first term in office			2
but the @entity107 , too , has come under fire for not moving quickly to fill growing bench vacancies			1
some moderates from both parties have long lamented threats of delays and filibuster attempts of most presidential appointments			2
they say ongoing vacancies have created a crisis in many federal courts , with bulging dockets being handled by too few judges .			1

nominees include one whose *selection* was blocked twice already in @entity25
@entity47 chair urges @entity25 to stop holding up nominations
republicans *blamed* for blocking nominees , but @entity107 said too slow
moderates say *unfilled* vacancies create crisis in courts *staffed* by too few judges
