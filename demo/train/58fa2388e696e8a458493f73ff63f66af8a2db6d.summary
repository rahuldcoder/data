@entity2 president @entity0 and @entity4 officials were completely blindsided by the announcement that @entity7 prime minister @entity6 will come to @entity8 to address a joint session of @entity10 this spring -- a move that 's rattled the @entity13 and diplomatic officials			1
the announcement from @entity13 speaker @entity16 's office this week came after several high - level interactions between @entity4 and @entity7 officials , including a phone call between @entity0 and @entity6 and a multi-hour meeting between secretary of state @entity21 and @entity7 ambassador @entity22 , a senior administration official told @entity1			1
@entity6 's snub has once again soured relations between the two world leaders , but @entity4 officials insist the tensions wo n't affect @entity4 support for @entity7			1
the @entity16 announcement came just over a week after @entity0 spoke over the phone with @entity6 and urged him not to lobby in favor of new @entity34 sanctions , " asking for some space , " a senior administration official said			1
but the hawkish @entity7 prime minister has a track record of supporting tougher sanctions against @entity34 and he 's expected to make that case when he addresses @entity10 in march			1
@entity0 and other world leaders negotiating with @entity34 over its nuclear program have firmly argued against a sanctions bill from @entity10 , which they say would unravel a delicate international coalition and tank negotiations			1
" we asked the @entity7 in private and public to sit tight and the president made clear if a deal was n't reached he would be the first in line advocating for more sanctions , " the official said			0
that 's what makes @entity6 's decision to address @entity10 a " pretty big deal , " the official added			1
and just a day before @entity16 's announcement , @entity21 met for several hours with @entity58 , who reportedly coordinated the visit between @entity61 congressional leadership and @entity6			0
but , still , there was no word of a @entity6 visit to @entity8			0
" is this a smart way for them to manage the relationship ? " a source close to @entity21 said			0
" the bilateral relationship is unshakable , but playing politics with that relationship could blunt secretary @entity21 's enthusiasm for being @entity7 's primary defender			0
" while @entity4 and @entity7 officials insist publicly that the relationship has " never been stronger " -- and by most measures it remains very strong -- @entity6 's address to @entity10 is just the latest in a string of diplomatic debacles that each time have sunk relations between the two leaders and their staff to new lows			1
@entity6 's continued expansion of @entity86 settlements in @entity2 has angered @entity4 officials , prompting one senior @entity13 official to call @entity88 a " chickenshit " in an october article in the @entity90 that brought private tensions to light			1
@entity0 's phone call with @entity6 and @entity21 's meeting with @entity58 just before the announcement give the snub a more personal veneer			0
@entity21 had made more than 50 calls in the preceding month to world leaders on the hot topics of @entity7 - @entity103 relations , such as @entity103 attempts to gain statehood through international organizations , the source said , adding that @entity21 's " patience is not infinite			0
" the in - your - face move from @entity6 's camp comes at a time when @entity7 needs @entity4 support on the international stage , with @entity103 making a full - court press to obtain statehood unilaterally through international institutions			1
another senior @entity4 official said the @entity7 breach of protocol and diplomatic courtesy takes a toll on @entity4 officials working strenuously to support @entity7 on the international stage			2
" they come to us with a lot of requests , but do n't have the courtesy of telling us ? that is what tipped it for us , " the official said			0
but again , the " core aspects of the relationship and commitment remain intact , " the official said			0
the snub may not sway the @entity4 's broad commitment to @entity7 's security and to supporting @entity7 in the international arena , but @entity6 will feel the repercussions when he comes to @entity8 in march without a ticket to the @entity13			1
the @entity13 announced that @entity0 wo n't meet with @entity6 during his visit because of the proximity to @entity7 elections			2
@entity6 will address @entity10 just 12 days before the elections			1
he had asked to push back his visit by nearly a month			0
@entity4 officials are n't the only ones taken aback			0
former @entity7 president @entity145 , while refusing to directly criticize @entity6 , conceded " there are rules and norms ( about ) how two countries have to behave			2
" " in that case , i think the rules created differences , and all of us have to look -- including our prime minister -- to go back to the basic rules and respect , " @entity145 said in an interview in @entity151 , @entity152 , on saturday			0
it would come as no surprise that @entity6 's opponents in the election are harsher			2
his former finance minister and current competitor in the march election , @entity166 , said saturday that @entity6 " is destroying our strategic relations with the @entity4 for an election speech			2
" yet ahead of the elections , @entity6 's visit may be a boon for him and his party in @entity7 as he plays himself up as the best protector of @entity7 's security , of which a relationship with the @entity4 is a key factor			1
" is that the relationship they want to have ? " the senior administration official said			0
" the last thing we want to do is hurt @entity7 , but if he is able to stiff the @entity4 president like that and we still offer him a meeting -- that invites him and anyone else to do that over and over			2
" @entity1 's @entity188 contributed to this report .			0

administration **unhappy** with @entity6 's plans to address @entity10
