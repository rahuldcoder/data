-- it has been dubbed @entity3 's @entity2			1
a place where @entity6 's government rolled the dice in a grand project to help the world rethink the way it does business			1
more than $ 50 billion has been spent in reshaping @entity12 for the @entity13 , in the process bringing traffic gridlock , a decline in tourism and environmental destruction			1
if it 's been tough for the locals , it has arguably been just as hard for the ex-pats who came to the @entity22 resort looking for a new life and are left wondering just what the legacy of this month 's games holds for them			2
one @entity29 businessman , who came to @entity3 in 1996 , believes a huge opportunity has been missed by the authorities			1
" what the @entity3 do n't understand is the price of what they have			1
the natural resources here , the forests , the rivers -- there 's so much untouched nature here it 's just incredible , " says @entity36			2
" you can walk in the mountains for several days and you wo n't see any houses , any roads , there 's no way to get there except for walking			2
there 's not really many places in the world left for that			2
that is a huge tourist attraction in itself			0
" @entity36 started a " banya " spa retreat in the @entity60 mountain region above the coastal city , but has spent the last year working in @entity63 due to the chaos brought about by @entity12 's reconstruction			1
" the last few years it 's been pretty bad , they 've been digging up the roads , lots of traffic jams			2
the locals , who are tourists who 'd come from @entity12 , they 've stopped coming completely			0
" the prices have shot up ... economically it 's made the whole thing very difficult			1
" for @entity78 businessman @entity77 , however , the influx of the thousands of people needed to turn @entity12 into an @entity80 venue has been a massive boon			1
@entity77 , who worked in investment banking before spotting opportunities for property investment in @entity3 , has found a niche helping @entity80 officials , broadcasters and sponsors to navigate @entity3 bureaucracy			1
i lived in @entity92 for a long time and i watched the growth and development there , and of course southern @entity92 is a much bigger area ... in a concentrated region like this , i 've never witnessed anything like the changes here , " he told @entity0			0
" there have been a lot of people who have relocated here working for various bodies			0
we 've done relocation for some of those companies , helping them find apartments all the way up to providing services , financial management and contracts			0
" in between these two perspectives lies @entity117 , who with his chef father runs a @entity120 seafood restaurant overlooking the harbor , a bakery and a catering business			1
" i think after the @entity13 it will be good because we will have good hotels , roads , a nice airport -- it will be very quick for people to come from @entity63 to enjoy the snow , " the 31 - year - old told @entity0			1
" right now , of course , you do n't get tourists			0
" that was late last year , when @entity12 's workforce was still battling towards its deadline of being ready for the february 7 opening ceremony			2
since then , security has been stepped up even further after several terrorist alerts , resulting in a clampdown on traffic into the city			0
@entity12 , which has a subtropical climate , has traditionally been the hub of the " @entity144 " -- a narrow 2 km belt of coast that stretches 145 km. it 's a popular summer retreat for @entity3 , but there is some doubt as to how many foreign tourists will make the long trip for the @entity13 despite the much - improved air and rail links			1
" before we were thinking yes , but right now we do n't know , " @entity117 says			0
" the authorities , their priority is terrorists , to control everybody , so i do n't know if we are going to have a lot of foreigners			0
you need to have documents for everything			0
we have a lot of questions about how it will work , but they do n't answer us			2
" but there is no doubting the tourism potential of the massively - revamped @entity60 mountain cluster , which @entity117 recalls had just one ski lift ( " i think they bought it secondhand from @entity180 " ) at the time of his first visit several months after @entity12 was awarded the @entity177 back in 2007			2
" i really enjoyed the quality of snow but it took 40 - 45 minutes to get to the top of the mountain , " he says			2
" they only had one road			0
there was nothing in @entity60 , a small village and nothing much , only @entity3 tourists			1
" now there are three high - end resorts , much to the delight of @entity3 's ski - loving president @entity6 , who has taken a hands - on approach in ensuring his grand project goes to plan			1
however , locals in @entity202 village outside @entity12 have complained about the effects all the building has had on their environment			0
@entity206 told @entity0 a train line built 20 yards from his fruit farm has left the produce rotting on the vine due to pollution at the construction sites			2
" every 10 minutes , he says , the high - speed train whizzes past his house , and it drives him crazy , " reports @entity0 's @entity213 , who says other residents told him the government had failed to fulfill promises to provide centralized plumbing and heating			1
" @entity206 says this was a beautiful place before the @entity13			1
you ca n't imagine how many trees were destroyed here to build this			0
" @entity12 's organizers , however , say they have undertaken extensive replanting programs to replace hundreds of thousands of trees in affected areas in the city and surrounding regions			1
areas for endangered plant and animal species have been created , according to the @entity236			0
the @entity238 river basin is also being restored , with millions of fish released into the waters , and @entity12 's aim is a " @entity247 " games that have " minimal impact on the climate " in terms of greenhouse gas emissions , said the official policy statement			2
@entity36 , though , despairs at the impact of development on what was previously a relatively unspoiled mountain region			0
" most of the @entity3 , especially the politicians , do n't get it			1
for a bad copy of what you 've got in @entity258 , made in a couple of years , you 're not going to impress people , " he says			0
president @entity6 's plan to enhance @entity3 's reputation as a major international player may have sacrificed some of the sprawling country 's natural beauty but , some say , it is revitalizing a region that had fallen into neglect following the @entity271 era			1
" the @entity80 torch is going to burn where i used to live , " says @entity272 , one of thousands of @entity12 residents who had to relocate			0
" i 'm very happy with my new house			0
" @entity77 -- the @entity78 fixer -- is excited about the business opportunities that lie ahead for the city , which will host @entity3 's first @entity281 race in october and will provide one of the venues for soccer 's @entity284			1
" @entity12 is kind of being reborn , " says the 54 - year - old , who publishes what he says is the only @entity290 information source in the city			0
" they will be having lots of events for a long time here			0
" we had the economic forum going on , one of the few largest business forums in @entity3 -- there 's one in @entity302 and one in @entity12 each year			1
tens of thousands of people come here to make contacts			0
" @entity3 , as @entity117 also acknowledges , is not an easy place to do business			1
through his ventures , the restaurant owner says they have been helped by its people 's love of @entity120 culture			1
" the biggest challenge is to find someone you trust			0
the second thing is to find and train the staff , " he says , adding that most of his workers come from other parts of the country			0
spa owner @entity36 says it might be even harder now for foreigners to set up business in @entity12			1
" it 's a question of the initial cost of it -- the price of land and construction materials has gone through the roof , it 's more expensive than in @entity63 , " says the 58 - year - old			1
" the second problem is finding people			0
they have made all the foreigners move out , mainly people from countries like @entity340 who 've been doing work there			1
" they 've had to leave so it 's more expensive to find people who can sink piles or lay bricks or things like that			0
then you have all the other problems of getting your suppliers			0
" despite the difficulties the @entity13 have brought him , @entity36 hopes international visitors will come to @entity12 and experience life in @entity3 -- though they may have to escape the confines of the @entity80 area to do so			1
" i 'm @entity356 but @entity3 is my home , i 'm very fond of this country and the people here			2
they 've got a lot of good things to offer , " he says			0
" the people are nice -- they 're a bit harsh at first , a bit hostile but , inside , most of the @entity3 have a very warm heart and are quick to make friends with you			2
" i 've had situations where you 've had a small car crash with somebody , they 're shouting , swearing and getting angry -- after about 10 minutes they 're inviting you home for dinner			0
