@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 sen. @entity2 is in the middle of a storm			1
she is beset by well - funded forces on the right who sense the @entity10 @entity2 's vulnerability in trying to defend a @entity12 seat in a red state			1
on the left , she is trying to avoid being pulled down by the undertow of a president whose decline in approval ratings and controversial health care reform law might not play well with her state 's conservative sensibilities			2
she 's been buffeted by rough re-election fights before , and in previous successful bids for the state legislature , state treasurer 's office and eventually two runoffs for the @entity12 seat she 's proven she has the thick skin and political acumen to weather storms			1
for example , her 1996 @entity12 win included a nail - biter of a runoff that she won by just 5,788 votes amid allegations of voter fraud by her challenger , state rep. @entity40 , and a congressional probe before she could finally assume office			2
she also has the political pedigree as the sister of @entity46 mayor @entity45 and daughter of former @entity46 mayor and @entity49			0
" we have been in this business for a long time ; you try to insulate yourself a little bit from some of the negative aspects , " @entity49 told the @entity50 in january			0
but this time there 's a lot more at stake			0
2014 midterms : what 's at stake " historically , her re-elections have been very tough , " said @entity63 , a social politics professor at @entity64 in @entity3			1
" this time , to some degree , it 's a nationalized re-election			2
she did n't have to contend with the outside interests trying to defeat her before			0
" @entity2 hails from a state where , despite the fact that just over 48 % of the electorate are registered @entity78 , voters have for the past two presidential cycles cast ballots for @entity82 nominees			2
of the eight members of @entity3 's congressional delegation , @entity2 and rep. @entity85 , who represents part of @entity46 , are the only two @entity78			1
during her 2008 re-election bid she managed to narrowly clear by two points the state 's 50 % threshold for electoral victory			1
and that was in a good year for democrats with the winds of a history - making victory in electing the nation 's first @entity98 - @entity97 president at their back			2
president @entity102 won big with minorities , women and young voters , and @entity78 were able to capitalize on that energized , high turnout in down - ballot races			2
in fact , that year 's election was the only one in which @entity2 did not face a runoff for the @entity12 seat			1
there are no such winds this year			0
it 's a midterm election year , and the electoral mood and climate have changed dramatically			1
2014 midterm elections once - popular president @entity102 now has an approval rating of 42 %			0
his popularity soured somewhat following controversies over his administration 's intelligence gathering techniques , congressional inquiries into @entity128 targeting of conservative political groups and the botched rollout of the @entity131 , the president 's signature health care reform law			1
@entity82 have vowed to hang @entity131 like a proverbial albatross around the necks of vulnerable democrats like @entity2			2
for example , the conservative @entity136 , funded by the @entity138 brothers , a pair of wealthy industrialists , has spent more than $ 3 million on ads in @entity3 highlighting @entity2 's 2010 vote for @entity131			1
she faces a strong @entity82 challenge from @entity97 rep. @entity145 , a doctor who has earned lauds for his charity work , and who in many ways symbolizes exactly what @entity2 is up against as one of only two @entity78 in her state 's congressional delegation			1
the challenge from tea party - backed retired air force col. @entity155 further complicates matters in that grassroots conservatives are rallying to his side , expanding the field of those taking shots at the incumbent			0
" @entity166 help us if this goes to a runoff and helps us determine the fate of the @entity12 , " said @entity164 , senior editor with the @entity165			1
@entity3 's election law calls for @entity172 in the rest of the country to be an open primary for all comers			1
if no candidate gets more than 50 % of the vote , a runoff is scheduled in december			0
these races will determine control of the @entity12 meanwhile , in the @entity12 , her party is clawing to keep its 53 - 45 majority			1
@entity78 are fighting to keep 21 of the 36 @entity12 seats up for grabs in november			0
half of those are @entity78 - held seats in red or purple states			0
" in order for her to get this far she had to have had people who vote @entity82 at the presidential level , " said @entity190 , deputy editor of the @entity191			0
" but @entity3 is difficult when we 're talking @entity78 and @entity82 ... you have people who are @entity2 by heritage but vote @entity82			1
" as a result , @entity2 has found herself in the precarious position of trying to keep her @entity12 seat in a state that trends red all the while supporting the leader of her party in a way that makes clear to the people in @entity3 that they are her priority			1
in her recent campaign ad , a clip shows @entity2 stating emphatically " the administration 's policies are simply wrong when it comes to oil and gas production in this nation			2
" " for years she 's forced @entity0 to respect @entity3 , " says the commercial 's narrator			2
the ad goes on to tout her efforts to end the federal government 's ban on offshore oil and gas drilling that was enacted after the 2010 @entity225 oil spill in the @entity226			0
the ad also highlights her victory in requiring the federal government to split offshore royalties with @entity3 and other oil and gas producing states			0
plus , as the ad reminds viewers , " now as the new chairman of the @entity234 , she holds the most powerful position in the @entity12 for @entity3			1
" it 's also an ad that @entity82 criticized for the senator 's use of staged , recreated news clips from a committee hearing			0
@entity2 's campaign pointed to congressional rules that ban lawmakers from using " radio or television coverage of the proceedings of the @entity12 for political campaign purposes			1
" @entity2 touts fight for oil and gas jobs in new ad still , @entity2 has stepped cautiously in her connection to @entity102			0
when the president visited her state in november , @entity2 traveled with him , but then she was conspicuously absent from a speech he gave at the @entity258			2
instead , she made the rounds of other events in the state			0
" she has to convince voters that she is not a typical national @entity2 , " @entity190 said			0
" she has to show some distance from the president , and democrats have to make congressman @entity145 an unacceptable alternative			0
" key races to watch in 2014 @entity1 's @entity268 contributed to this report .			0

a changed political climate , influence of outside money complicates re-election bid
@entity2 has faced tough political battles and runoffs in previous races
@entity3 's @entity12 race could determine control of the *chamber*
@entity2 has had to carefully distance herself from the president in some instances
