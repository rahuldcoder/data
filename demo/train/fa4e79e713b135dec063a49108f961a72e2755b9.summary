-- the @entity2 will never prosecute journalists for doing their jobs , and recent probes into national security leaks targeted government officials , not reporters , attorney general @entity1 said in remarks to a @entity11 committee thursday			1
@entity1 , amid a cloud of controversy for investigations in recent years involving the @entity15 and @entity16 , said he has launched a review of existing @entity2 guidelines on investigations involving the press , and he is meeting with journalists to discuss those guidelines			1
" the department goal in investigating leak cases is to identify and prosecute government officials who jeopardize government secrets , " @entity1 told the @entity23 during a wide - ranging budget hearing that included questions about the federal prison system , drone strikes and the closing of the prison at @entity30			1
he added that as long as he is at the justice helm , he will never prosecute a reporter for doing her or his job			1
after @entity1 's testimony , the @entity37 asked him in writing to appear this month to explain testimony he gave may 15 concerning the @entity16 case , in which a reporter was labeled a criminal co-conspirator during a leak investigation			1
switching directions during his allotted time to speak sen. @entity47 , @entity48 , raised questions about this week 's report that the @entity51 and @entity52 were monitoring @entity54 ' phone records			0
he asked specifically whether @entity1 could assure him that no member of @entity57 had been monitored , as it might give the executive branch leverage over the legislative branch			2
@entity1 responded that it was n't an appropriate venue to answer the question , to which @entity47 said the appropriate answer was , " no , we stayed in our lane , and i assure you we did not spy on members of @entity57			2
" " there has been no intention to spy on members of @entity57 and members of the @entity73 , " @entity1 said			2
sen. @entity74 , chairwoman of the committee , interrupted the back - and - forth to say that the matter deserved a briefing before the entire @entity11 , and involving the @entity51 and @entity1			2
sen. @entity78 , @entity79 , the ranking @entity80 member of the committee , opened his remarks by saying the @entity2 was " mired in a controversy of late " that raised questions about the @entity2 's " adherence to the rule of law " and @entity1 's ability to lead			1
he further said @entity54 deserved an attorney general " not distracted by controversies of his own making			1
" @entity1 emphasized he was " fully engaged " in efforts to resolve these problems and evaluates his own performance on a daily basis			2
" i have not done a perfect job			0
i think i 've done a good job , but i think i could do better , " he said , adding that his meetings with journalists are aimed at formulating new policies and regulations " and hopefully get that behind us			0
" responding to @entity104 's query about whether there would be a tipping point at which @entity1 might need to step down , @entity1 -- who has suggested he might not serve for president @entity108 's entire second term -- said he had more goals to accomplish before he sat down with @entity108 to discuss a transition			1
" the tipping point might be fatigue , " @entity1 told @entity78			2
" you get to a point where you just get tired			0
" sen. @entity113 did not continue the line of questioning regarding the leaks but defended @entity1 and lamented that the hearing was used to berate him			2
" i believe in your integrity , " she said			0
" i believe you 're a good attorney general			0
i believe you 've had undue problems that are hard to anticipate			0
i believe you 're responding as best you possibly could			0
" @entity1 is under fire for two instances , in particular			2
the first involves his @entity2 obtaining two months of phone records from @entity15 as part of an investigation into the news agency 's may 2012 coverage of a foiled airline bomb plot in @entity127			0
the second case involves justice obtaining the phone records , e-mails and security badge information of @entity16 ' @entity133 , who reported on classified intelligence about @entity135 in 2009			1
no reporters were singled out as potential criminals in the @entity15 case , but in the @entity16 case , an @entity52 agent said @entity133 might be an " aider and abettor and / or co-conspirator " to disclosing secret information			0
the @entity133 case has been of most interest to @entity1 's critics because of a may 15 remark he made to @entity57 about the leaks			1
" with regard to the potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material , that is not something that i 've ever been involved in or heard of or would think would be a wise policy , " @entity1 said			0
@entity158 rep. @entity158 called @entity1 's statement " a lie , by most people 's standards , " and the @entity80 - controlled @entity37 is investigating whether the attorney general lied under oath			1
@entity1 wrote sens. @entity165 , @entity166 , and @entity167 , @entity168 , of the @entity37 on wednesday , saying -- as he did before the @entity23 on thursday -- that he was reviewing his department 's guidelines regarding investigations involving the media			1
" as part of this review , i have hosted a series of productive meetings with representatives of news organizations and other interested parties in order to solicit their valuable input , " @entity1 wrote			0
" i welcome your contributions to this process and hope that both of you will join the deputy attorney general and me when we schedule meetings with interested members of @entity57			0
" @entity191 's letter ( @entity192 ) @entity165 replied in a letter signed by every @entity80 member of the @entity195 -- but no @entity196 -- that none of @entity1 's statements so far , nor those of his subordinates , " constitutes a satisfactory on - the - record response			1
" @entity165 asked @entity1 to appear before the committee june 18 or , if that is n't feasible , to pick a date between then and june 28 , @entity165 told @entity1			0
referring to @entity1 's may 15 testimony , the letter said , " this statement left members of the @entity23 and the @entity54 people with the clear understanding that the @entity2 had never taken the unprecedented step of characterizing a member of the media as a criminal co-conspirator in a sworn court document			1
" @entity217 's letter ( @entity192 ) the @entity219 and @entity2 have both issued statements saying @entity133 was never prosecuted , so any assertion that @entity1 lied is wrong			1
the @entity2 has also said that @entity1 recused himself from the @entity15 probe because he had been interviewed about the leak during the investigation , but republicans say the statement was missing a key piece of information : when did he recuse himself ? after hearing concerns that the @entity2 's investigations had put reporters at a legal risk for simply doing their jobs , @entity1 sat down with various news executives last week			1
he is continuing those meetings this week			0
" we expressed our concerns that reporters felt some fear for doing their jobs , that they were concerned about using their e-mail , using their office telephone and that we need to have the freedom to do their job , " @entity237 executive editor @entity236 said after the meeting			0
@entity1 told @entity247 on wednesday that he would not step down amid criticism over security leaks investigations .			0

@entity80 senator suggests @entity1 " distracted by controversies of his own making "
