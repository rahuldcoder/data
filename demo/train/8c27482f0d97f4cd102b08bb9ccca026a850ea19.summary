@entity1 's immigration debate has become red hot because president @entity4 's critics not only believe that he lacks the authority to act without the consent of @entity7 , but also that he must not change internal enforcement priorities before first " securing the border			1
" the truth is , the single most important thing @entity7 can do to meaningfully improve our border security is pass comprehensive immigration reform			1
too often , border security is viewed as preventing the illegal entry of people and goods across state lines			1
however , border security also is about ensuring the safe , efficient flow of commerce and increasing international trade			1
comprehensive reform will do both , while our current approach serves neither objective			2
i say this as someone who has made countless trips to the @entity1 - @entity33 border			2
i 've seen firsthand how our current approach to policing the border is based on muddled objectives and unmeasurable benchmarks that mask failure			2
our failure to secure the border is not for a lack of trying			2
@entity7 has passed at least four laws since 1986 authorizing increases in @entity45 personnel			1
in 1980 , there were 2,268 @entity45 agents at the southwest border ; under president @entity4 , that number grew to an all - time high of 21,730			2
there was 14 miles of fencing on the border in 1990 ; under this administration , we 've erected nearly 651 miles of new fencing and dramatically increased our mobile surveillance capabilities			2
yet there is scant evidence that we can spend our way out of this problem			0
recent studies by @entity61 and the @entity62 reach desultory conclusions about our ability to stop illegal border crossings			2
we have been able to stop only about 30 % of those attempting to cross our border between 1996 and 2009 , according to the studies			1
simply spending more money and adding more agents will not secure the border , but it will complicate trade			0
@entity72 can not seek maximum security without shuttering trade , but nations can not have fully open borders if they want real security			0
we can build more fences , identify more tracks , and inspect more vehicles , but only if we are prepared to greatly diminish the free flow of commerce			0
our nation has wisely opted for a balanced approach			0
the central reason we will not be more effective at achieving our national security border goals is because @entity1 policy , since the 1980s , effectively treats all border incursions as equal threats to the homeland			1
this diminishes our ability to prevent true threats -- such as drug cartels , human traffickers and potential terrorists -- from " flooding the zone " and gaining passage into the homeland			0
these criminals know that a small percentage of their goods and vehicles will be inspected and seized			0
for them , this is the cost of doing business			0
unless we begin to prioritize threats and facilitate the legitimate entry of validated economic migrants , the cost - benefit analysis will remain in their favor			1
border security professionals tell me the vast majority of illegal entrants are @entity33 seeking temporary work in the @entity1			1
all illegal crossings undermine border integrity , but temporary , work - seeking migrants do not pose a significant national security threat to the homeland			1
the best way to strengthen border security without stifling trade is for @entity7 to establish a system whereby migrant workers can apply for validated , biometric entry keys to cross our border safely and legally			1
this will free up our border security cadre to focus on preventing cartels , traffickers and terrorists from exploiting holes in our current system			1
furthermore , channeling economic migrants to efficient legal crossings will reduce threats to their own safety , improve human dignity , and give interdiction operators the bandwidth to respond to a higher percentage of tripwire incursions across our nearly 2,000 - mile border with @entity33			1
we need a new risk - based approach , informed by intelligence and emphasizing information sharing and international cooperation			0
fortunately , there is a precedent that offers great hope			0
the @entity154 's @entity153 / @entity152 is a model of risk - based screening that is increasing our security and facilitating commerce			0
the @entity154 approach allows approved , prescreened travelers to establish they are not security threats and move more nimbly to transact international business			0
this allows @entity154 officers to focus their attention on more consequential threats to aviation security			0
this risk - based approach is better for the traveling public and provides more security at less cost			0
we can adopt a similar approach to our land border with @entity33 , if the @entity7 acts			1
as a nation , we do not accept a system where more than half of terror plots will be successful ; we prioritize threats and go after terror cells with zeal			0
we need to embrace the same strategic approach to border security and abandon a system that does not adequately distinguish between worker crossings and true dangers to @entity1 security			1
by normalizing the process for work - seeking migrants to legally enter the country , we will legalize a critical segment of our labor force and empower security professionals to focus on the true risks to our homeland			1
this will be good for our economy and our security			0
now is the time for @entity7 to act .			2

to meaningfully improve our border security , @entity7 should pass immigration reform
migrant workers should be allowed to apply for validated , biometric entry keys to cross our border safely and legally
