-- @entity2 and @entity3 drug cartels have jumped the @entity4 and expanded into @entity5 , working closely with local criminal gangs to carve out a staging area for an assault on the lucrative @entity10 market			1
authorities destroy cannabis found in @entity13			0
@entity5 is appealing to drug traffickers from @entity15			1
the situation has gotten so out of hand that tiny @entity18 , the fifth - poorest nation in the world , is being called @entity5 's first narco - state			1
others talk about how @entity5 's @entity22 has become the @entity23			1
in all , officials say , at least nine top - tier @entity15 drug cartels have established bases in 11 @entity5 nations			1
" the same organizations that we investigate in @entity15 that are involved in drug activity toward the @entity33 are engaged in this trafficking in @entity5 , " said @entity28 , the @entity29 regional director for @entity10 and @entity5			1
" there 's not one country that has n't been touched to some extent			2
" the calculus is simple : bigger profits in @entity10 than in the @entity33 , less law enforcement in @entity5 than in @entity10			1
the driving force is the booming @entity10 market for cocaine			1
" the exponential rise in the number of consumers has made @entity10 the fastest - growing and most - profitable market in the world , " said @entity44 , dean of the @entity45 at the @entity46			1
while the @entity10 market has been expanding , use in the @entity33 has declined from its peak in the 1980s , the @entity52 said in its 2009 annual report , issued in july			1
" cocaine use prevalence in the @entity33 is 50 percent lower than it was two decades ago , while @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and the @entity63 have all seen cocaine use double or triple in recent years , " the @entity52 report said			1
about 1,000 tons of pure cocaine are produced each year , nearly 60 percent of which evades law enforcement interception and makes it to market , the report said			1
that 's a wholesale global market of about $ 70 billion			2
@entity73 traffic about 250 tons to @entity10 each year , though not all of it makes it there , the @entity52 said			1
the @entity10 market totals about $ 11 billion			1
about 27 percent of the cocaine that entered @entity10 in 2006 came from @entity5 , the @entity76 said			1
huge profits make @entity10 particularly attractive			1
two pounds of uncut cocaine can sell for $ 22,000 in the @entity33 but for $ 45,000 in @entity10 , analyst @entity80 wrote in a policy journal this year			1
the @entity82 said the price in @entity10 can be three times more than in the @entity33			1
" it 's a significant market for them to exploit , " @entity28 said			2
a strong euro and weaker dollar also make @entity10 attractive to traffickers because of favorable exchange rates			1
there 's also the fact that the @entity92 recently issued a 500 euro note , currently equivalent to about $ 700			2
the largest @entity33 denomination in circulation is the $ 100 bill			1
traffickers prefer the large euro notes because they are easier to carry in large quantities			2
for example , @entity28 said that $ 1 million in $ 100 bills weighs 22 pounds , while $ 1 million in 500 euro notes weighs 3.5 pounds			0
" it 's a huge difference , " he said			2
though @entity10 is highly attractive to traffickers , it can have tight , @entity5 - style security			1
so the @entity2 and @entity3 cartels have discovered that it 's much easier to smuggle large loads into @entity5 and then break that up into smaller shipments to the continent -- mostly @entity59 , the @entity63 and @entity62			1
@entity5 is a smuggler 's dream , suffering from a combination of factors that make the area particularly vulnerable			1
it is among the poorest and least stable regions in the world			2
governments are weak and ineffective and , as a top @entity29 chief testified to the @entity123 this summer , officials are often corrupt			2
law enforcement also is largely riddled with corruption			1
foot soldiers can be recruited from a large pool of poor and desperate youth			0
" it 's a point of least resistance , " @entity28 said			2
@entity5 refers to @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity13 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity18 , @entity18 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144			1
" this area of the world is ripe , " @entity44 said			2
" there has been very little attention paid to it			0
the @entity33 is loath to give aid to these countries because they are corrupt			2
" @entity33 authorities find themselves at a great disadvantage fighting cartels that have much more money and guns			1
the @entity29 has four offices -- in @entity157 , @entity136 , @entity141 and @entity158 -- to cover a continent that spans 11.7 million square miles and has nearly 1 billion people			0
" it 's a big place , " @entity28 acknowledges , noting that there are 54 countries on the continent			2
local police also are vastly outgunned			0
@entity18 offers an alarming example			2
" @entity171 ... have 60 agents , one vehicle and often no fuel , " analyst @entity80 wrote in a journal called @entity169 , published by the @entity170			0
" as a result , when culprits are apprehended , they are driven in a taxi to the police station			0
they just recently received six sets of handcuffs from the @entity63 , which were badly needed			0
in the military , one rusty ship patrols the 350 - kilometer ( 217 - mile ) coastline and 88 islands			0
" even when criminals are caught , @entity80 said , " the near absence of a judicial system allows traffickers to operate unimpeded			0
" for example , she said , " because the police are so impotent , the culprits are often held for just a few hours before senior military personnel suddenly attain extraordinary judicial powers to demand their release			0
" the few officials who stand up to the traffickers receive death threats or are killed			2
@entity5 also is particularly attractive to traffickers because it is near " the soft underbelly of @entity10 , " said retired four - star army gen. @entity201 , who was drug policy director for president @entity202			1
geography plays another role because @entity5 is fairly close to the three @entity206 nations that produce nearly all of the world 's cocaine -- @entity2 , @entity210 and @entity211			1
many of the shipments depart from @entity214 , which shares a 1,273 - mile ( 2,050 - kilometer ) porous border with @entity2 and is even closer to @entity5			1
" they go right dead - ass across the shortest route , " @entity201 said			0
most of the cocaine shipments cross the @entity4 in large " mother ships " and then are off - loaded to small vessels near the coastline , the @entity76 said			0
small planes modified for overseas flight that can carry a 1 - ton cargo also have been used			0
most of those come from @entity214 , the @entity76 reported			0
a report issued in july by the @entity227 said traffickers use go - fast boats , fishing vessels and commercial shipping containers as the primary means of smuggling cocaine out of @entity214			2
@entity201 also noted the use of go - fast boats and special planes			0
@entity29 assistant administrator @entity237 testified before the @entity123 in june that authorities in @entity143 seized a cocaine shipment last year from a twin - engine aircraft marked with a @entity242 insignia			0
the flight originated in @entity214 , he said			0
the @entity227 report noted that " @entity33 government officials have observed an increase in suspicious air traffic originating in @entity214			1
" in 2004 , the report said , authorities tracked 109 suspect flights out of @entity214			0
in 2007 , officials tracked 178 suspicious flights			0
then there 's the crime connection in @entity5			1
" @entity2 and @entity214 traffickers are entrenched in @entity5 and have cultivated long - standing relationships with @entity5 criminal networks to facilitate their activities in the region , " @entity237 told a @entity123 subcommittee on @entity5 affairs			1
" these organizations do n't operate in a vacuum , " @entity28 said			0
" they have to align themselves with @entity5 criminal groups			2
" the cartels also have aligned themselves with terrorists , @entity237 said			0
" the threat of narco - terrorism in @entity5 is a real concern , including the presence of international terrorist organizations operating or based in @entity5 , such as the regional threat presented by @entity270 in the @entity278 , " he said , referring to @entity270 activists in @entity271			1
" in addition , @entity29 investigations have identified elements of @entity2 's @entity283 [ @entity282 ] as being involved in cocaine trafficking in @entity5			1
" @entity28 said the groups operating in @entity5 are " primarily narcotics organizations " but acknowledged that the @entity282 guerrillas in @entity2 are a force to be dealt with			2
the rebels have waged war on the @entity2 government for more than 40 years			0
" the profit potential is such that the @entity282 is one of the largest cocaine - trafficking operations globally and is also a terrorist organization , " he said			0
@entity44 and @entity201 see less evidence of terrorist connections with the traffickers in @entity5 , both using nearly identical language			1
" i 'd be really skeptical of those kinds of assertions , " @entity201 said			0
" i 'm quite skeptical about linkages between cartels and terrorists , " @entity44 said			0
" the criminal groups seek profits			0
they 're not interested in taking over governments			0
" still , @entity44 said , traffickers and terrorists may use some of the same criminal networks			0
analysts note that the surge of cartel activity in @entity5 is a fairly recent development			2
the @entity52 report said it started around 2005			0
@entity80 places it around 2006			0
@entity201 , who was in the @entity317 in the 1990s , said he saw the problem coming a long time ago			0
" i 've been warning people in @entity10 and @entity15 starting 10 years ago where this issue was going to move , " he said			1
" the @entity10 absolutely blew me off			2
" the @entity52 report offers some hope , saying that cocaine seizures in @entity10 peaked in 2006 and topped out in @entity5 in 2007			1
overall seizures have declined since 2006 , the report said			0
" this trend appears to be continuing in 2009 and includes declines in the number and volume of seizures made in the region and in the number of air couriers coming from the region in @entity10 , " the report concluded			1
for example , authorities seized 11 large shipments in @entity5 in 2007 , four in 2008 and none so far this year			2
the report does not specify whether there are fewer shipments or smarter criminals avoiding detection			0
but if there is a decline , the @entity29 's @entity28 said he has not seen it			0
" in the last three or four years , it 's increased quite dramatically , " he said			0
" the @entity2 organizations have been active there longer than that			0
in the last two years , we 've also seen @entity3 involvement in the area as well			0

@entity18 , fifth - poorest nation in the world , is called @entity5 's first narco - state
officials : at least nine @entity15 drug cartels have set up bases in @entity5
@entity5 has little law enforcement , making it easier for traffickers there
more money can be made selling drugs to @entity10 than to the @entity33 , officials say
