-- the milestones keep coming for @entity2 , but the tennis superstar had to dig deep at the @entity4 on sunday before notching his 900th career win and reaching his 36th successive grand slam quarterfinal			1
@entity2 made a flying start against home hope @entity8 , but then lost the next two sets to raise the prospect of his earliest defeat at a major tournament since he lost in the third round at @entity4 to @entity15 in 2004			1

however , he regained his composure to triumph 6 - 1 4 - 6 2 - 6 6 - 2 6 - 3 and earn a clash with another @entity25 , sixth seed @entity26			1

it 's a lot of years , a lot of sacrifices and a lot of matches like this			0

the 31 - year - old , who this time last year had dropped from a career - high fifth in the rankings to a lowly 470th after 14 months out with injury , trailed 4 - 1 in the third set before launching an another incredible comeback			1
" maybe he had a little bit of doubt , though , in that moment , " said 34th - ranked @entity76 , who also reached the last eight in @entity92 in 2003 , 2005 and 2009			2
" then i just pushed hard and i won the third			0
and then i was just dreaming and dreaming to try to do it again , and i did it			0
