-- a new piece of malware has caused an uptick in @entity5 customers reporting infected machines , renewing a timeless debate on the state of @entity10 security versus @entity11			1
the trojan horse is called @entity13			1
it 's a web pop - up containing a spoof message that tells customers their machines are infected by a virus and they must install anti-virus software			1
if customers agree to install the software , the program sporadically loads porn websites on their computer			1
@entity26 writer @entity25 was first to spot a long thread of complaints in @entity5 's support forums related to @entity13 , with at least 200 posts of customers reporting they 've been infected by the malware			2
" i 've done similar searches in the past ... [ and ] i have never found more than one or two in - the - wild reports , " @entity25 wrote			0
" this time , the volume is truly exceptional			0
" furthering his case , @entity25 in a follow - up article quoted an @entity41 technician who claims that phone calls to @entity41 support have grown four to five times recently , and the majority of the calls are related to @entity13			0
customers and technology observers have debated for years whether the @entity10 is truly more secure than a @entity11 pc			1
the general consensus among security researchers is that there 's nothing about the @entity10 that makes it inherently more secure than @entity11 -- indeed , the @entity10 platform has been easily penetrated in the @entity56 hacking contest in years past			1
but @entity11 has always been a juicier target for malicious hackers because it has much larger market share than the @entity10 as a result , when customers switch from a @entity11 to a @entity10 , they 're often under the impression that they 're switching to a more secure , sterile environment where they wo n't need to install expensive , resource - hogging anti-virus software			1
while it 's not true that the @entity10 is more secure , theplatform is generally " safer " because fewer people target it , security researchers have told @entity0 in the past			2
@entity25 's discovery renews this debate : a new piece of malware seems to be fooling more @entity10 customers than past examples			1
so does this change the scenario ? should @entity10 customers install anti-virus software by default like most @entity11 customers do ? @entity83 , a security researcher who has repeatedly won the annual @entity56 hacking contest by hacking @entity10 and @entity85 , told @entity0 he does n't think so			1
@entity83 noted that @entity86 recently pointed out that 1 in 14 downloads on @entity11 are malicious			0
and the fact that there is just one piece of @entity10 malware being widely discussed illustrates how rare malware still is on the @entity10 platform , he said			0
and while 200 posts complaining about @entity13 in @entity5 's support forums may seem like a lot , that 's still a small fraction of the millions of @entity10 customers in the world			1
while @entity13 does show that the problem is getting worse and people should be more wary about malware , it does n't necessarily mean that every @entity10 user today should rush to buy anti-virus software , @entity83 said			1
ultimately , it 's up to the customer because there 's a trade - off involved			0
anti-virus software will help protect your system from being infected , but it 's expensive , uses system memory and reduces battery life			1
" @entity10 malware is still relatively rare , but is getting worse , " @entity83 said			0
" at some point soon , the scales will tip to installing antivirus , but at this point , i do n't think it 's worth it yet for most people			0
" in looking into the effects of @entity13 , @entity0 's sister publication @entity122 did a thorough investigation on the state of @entity10 malware , speaking with 14 @entity10 support specialists			2
" the truth is hard to tease out , " @entity122 's @entity127 wrote			0
" partly because @entity130 still makes up a comparatively small percentage of the global os market share , and partly because @entity5 itself is a secretive company , it 's not easy to find out whether malware on the @entity10 is indeed becoming more common , or it 's simply being reported on more often			2
" the results were all over the map , with most certified @entity10 support specialists logging a low number of malware reports			0
but some @entity140 technicians noticed an uptick in malware instances , thanks to @entity13			0
though the conclusion is unclear , the moral of this story is to be wary that @entity10 malware is in the wild , and be cautious about installing sketchy software from unfamiliar sources			2
@entity13 may be the first wake - up call for people who believed that @entity10 do n't get viruses			2

a " trojan horse " called @entity13 is telling @entity10 customers they must install anti-virus software
if a customer agrees , the program loads porn sites on their computer
despite some *perceptions* , experts say the @entity10 is n't more secure than @entity11
anti-virus software will help protect your system from being infected , but it 's expensive
