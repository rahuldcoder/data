-- the rumor that @entity2 will suddenly start charging users to access the site has become one of the social media era 's perennial chain letters			1
while @entity2 prominently advertises that its service is " free and always will be " on its homepage , it has n't stopped false rumors of a pay scheme from going viral on numerous occasions , most recently in conjunction with the major profile redesign that the site announced earlier this month			1
given the ubiquity of these rumors , we thought it was worth exploring their origin -- and why we can guarantee @entity2 will never charge you to use its service			1
a long history chain letters -- which date back to the days of snail mail -- have dogged nearly every online service that achieved critical mass. while they vary in the details , the general premise is that something negative will happen to your account unless you spread the message to your friends			0
on @entity38 , this took the form of ims that needed to be shared with friends to avoid account deletion			0
on @entity44 , rumors spread that the service was getting " too crowded " -- and hence , they needed to determine which accounts were active and remove those that were n't			1
on @entity51 , word was that the service was getting so popular that the site would soon start charging members , and the only way to avoid the fees was to -- you guessed it -- forward the message to your friends			0
of course , none of these situations ever actually materialized , but it did n't stop millions of users from passing the message along			1
@entity63 has a detailed overview of these scams and others that have permeated the web over the years , going all the way back to the early days of @entity69			0
@entity2 's business model the recent round of @entity2 rumors suggest that the site will start charging for membership as a result of the upcoming new profiles			1
the new @entity2 does indeed feature some dramatic changes , but you can rest assured that one of them is n't that the site will start charging you			1
here 's why : for starters , it does n't need the money			1
@entity2 is estimated to be on track to pull in around $ 4 billion in revenue in 2011 , and has raised more than $ 2 billion in venture capital			1
it 's also on track to go public in 2012 , a move that would bring in significantly more capital for the company and value it at between $ 80 billion and $ 100 billion			1
more importantly , the company 's business model revolves around having as many users as possible			2
remaining free is paramount to doing that			0
@entity2 makes its money on highly targeted advertising that 's based on the plethora of data that its members share on the site			1
restricting users ' ability to use the site would actually be detrimental to that model			0
@entity2 did n't even introduce its ad platform until 2007 -- because the company wanted to focus on adding users as quickly as possible			1
that 's not to say social networking sites have n't found success in charging members for some services			0
@entity115 offers premium memberships with features such as enhanced search , direct messaging and seeing who has viewed your profile			0
some dating sites , like @entity124 and @entity126 charge users to message each other			0
still , those services are appealing to a specific audience -- @entity2 's goal is to connect everyone in the world			1
that ca n't be done if you need a credit card to use the service			0
why it will never charge you of course , @entity2 is in business to make money			1
beyond advertising , it has found ways to profit directly from its users through @entity142 , a form of currency that can be used on the site in social games like @entity147 and @entity148			2
in the future , we expect @entity2 to find additional ways to monetize			2
the company could grow its credit system to become a rival to @entity155			0
we could also see @entity2 extending its ad platform beyond the social network itself and onto the wider web -- in order to compete with @entity161 's @entity160			2
there 's also potential in e-commerce			0
although @entity2 's deals product fell flat , an increasing number of merchants are starting to sell their wares directly on the social networking site			2
might @entity2 one day provide its own tools for powering such activity ? it 's certainly possible			2
the one thing that all of these models have in common is that they need a critical mass of users to be successful			0
@entity2 has that , and would never risk losing it by charging people for basic access to the tools that make its multi-billion dollar business work			2
