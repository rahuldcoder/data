-- authorities in the @entity3 town of @entity4 are hoping it wo n't be a silent night this @entity6 , following a spate of tourist cancellations due to recent violence in @entity10			1
the @entity12 town of around 29,000 people , eight kilometers ( five miles ) south of @entity15 , contains the @entity16 , venerated by @entity17 as the birthplace of @entity19			1
one of the oldest surviving @entity17 churches in the world , it has been considered the site of @entity19 's birth since at least the 2nd century , and is the most significant tourist attraction in the @entity3 territories			1
but @entity3 authorities are concerned that the recent conflict between @entity29 and @entity30 will deter pilgrims from visiting the site during the traditional @entity6 boom season this month			1
conflict 's impact although @entity29 's conflict was with @entity30 -- the @entity39 group which controls the other @entity3 territory of @entity10 , located about 70 kilometers away -- the week - long bout of violence prompted many potential visitors to @entity4 to cancel their bookings			1
" it 's had a big impact , " said @entity43 , spokesman for the @entity3 @entity44			0
" we 've had some cancellations			0
" @entity4 drew about 140,000 visitors -- many of them religious pilgrims -- in the two weeks around @entity6 last year , said @entity43 , providing an important boost to the @entity3 economy			1
@entity53 , spokeswoman for the @entity54 , said she feared that would not be the case this season			0
" we expected a decrease in tourism , and many tourists have canceled , " she said			0
" this season if the tourists do not come we will not have a good economic situation , and the citizens will be affected			0
" while @entity10 sustained most of the damage from the recent conflict , the @entity12 was not totally removed from the violence , she said , as " rockets from @entity10 were shot at @entity15			1
" @entity70 boost but despite the violence scaring off some potential visitors , respite may come from the recent successful @entity3 bid for an upgrade in status at the @entity70			1
in late november , the @entity70 's general assembly voted to elevate the status of the @entity3 delegation from " non-member observer entity " to " non-member observer state , " the same category as the @entity83			1
@entity3 hope the upgraded recognition will provide new leverage in their dealings with @entity29			1
@entity53 said the @entity70 vote prompted an influx of new bookings , but not enough yet to offset cancellations			1
" before the vote , the situation was n't secure			0
but now it is like the whole world -- the @entity70 -- is supervising any attack that might happen , " she said			1
" that will protect us and protect our visitors from all over the world			0
" @entity43 said he expected the vote to have a positive ongoing effect on tourism to the @entity3 territories			0
a recent report , commissioned by the @entity104 , looking at tourism development , found @entity4 was not capitalizing on its potential			1
the majority of visitors were day trippers on short visits from @entity29 , meaning the full economic benefits of tourism did not flow into the local community			1
" it will give us a chance to promote @entity117 and for people to know more about @entity117 , " he said			0
@entity120 status in june , the @entity16 and surrounding pilgrimage route became the first @entity3 world heritage site			2
its inscription on to the prestigious list of sites -- deemed as holding " outstanding universal value " as part of the world 's shared heritage -- came after the @entity3 were granted membership of @entity131 , the @entity70 ' heritage body in 2011			2
one of @entity138 's most holy places , the church -- which features a 14 - pointed silver star set into the marble floor marking the precise spot where @entity19 is said to have been born -- drew two million visitors in 2011 , according to local heritage expert @entity140 , of @entity4 's @entity104			2
@entity17 solidarity one recent visitor told @entity0 that the volatility of the region should not deter pilgrims			1
@entity146 , a @entity147 deacon from @entity148 , @entity149 , was on a tour of the @entity151 with nine others from his parish when the hostilities in @entity10 broke out in november			0
" we were up on hills looking across @entity15 , looking across at the @entity157 and we saw a plume of smoke in the distance , which was a rocket landing , " he said			0
" we heard small arms fire , saw the reservists being called out			0
" despite witnessing signs of the conflict , the situation did not affect the tour " at all , " he said , encouraging other @entity17 to make the pilgrimage unless there were official warnings to stay away			1
he had made the trip , " to bring the @entity171 to life , to see the places where @entity19 walked , talked , taught , " he said			0
" until you see it you ca n't really imagine the distances and where he went and what happened in those days			0
seeing the desolation in places , all those things bring to mind some of the parables that come to life in the scriptures			0
" @entity185 , of @entity187 christian tourism company @entity186 , said the company had received an influx of interest in a forthcoming tour of the @entity151 following the violence in @entity10			2
she believed it was motivated by a sense of @entity17 solidarity			2
" often the group leaders feel that at times like these you really do have to go out and support the @entity17 , because they desperately need the support			2
" @entity53 said that authorities remained hopeful the number of visitor bookings would recover so pilgrims could enjoy the city 's planned events , which included a @entity206 lighting ceremony on december 15 , and a choral festival before midnight @entity208 on @entity6			1
" they 're optimistic that the numbers will go up , and it will be safe here , " she said			0
" @entity6 is a period where people all around the world come to @entity117			2
it 's a center of attention and a time of peace			0
i do n't think any political conflicts will happen during that period -- we hope			2
it 's really important to have peace in this season			0

authorities in @entity4 say @entity17 have been canceling @entity6 pilgrimages
the cause is the recent conflict in the region between @entity29 and @entity30
they hope bookings will recover due to interest following a @entity70 status upgrade
