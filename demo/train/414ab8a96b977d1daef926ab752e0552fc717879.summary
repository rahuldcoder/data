anniversaries are useful moments to pause and reflect			0
for the 70th anniversary of @entity5 and subsequent campaign in northern @entity6 , it is also an opportunity to look at the past in detail and ask how much of what we think we know is true and how much is well - entrenched myth			2
not only is it more interesting , it is also of greater worth as we plan for the future and pray there will never be a conflict like @entity19 again			2
myth : @entity5 was predominantly an @entity20 operation reality : for many people , @entity5 is defined by the bloodshed at @entity24 -- the codename for one of the five beaches where @entity29 forces landed -- and the @entity20 airborne drops			2
even in @entity32 , the perception is still that d - day was a largely @entity20 show ; in the recent @entity32 tv mini-series , " @entity38 , " there was a reference to the " @entity20 landings " in @entity6			1
but despite " @entity41 , " despite " @entity42 , " despite those 11 photographs taken by @entity44 in the swell on that morning of june 6 1944 , d - day was not a predominantly @entity20 effort			1
rather , it was an @entity29 effort with , if anything , @entity49 taking the lead			0
yes , gen. @entity51 , the supreme @entity29 commander , was @entity20 , but his deputy , air chief marshal sir @entity52 was @entity49 , as were all three service chiefs			2
air marshal sir @entity54 , commander of the tactical air forces , was also @entity49			0
the plan for @entity57 -- as d - day was codenamed -- was largely that of gen. @entity59 , the land force commander			1
the @entity60 had overall responsibility for @entity5 , the naval plan			0
of the 1,213 warships involved , 200 were @entity20 and 892 were @entity49 ; of the 4,126 landing craft involved , 805 were @entity20 and 3,261 were @entity49			2
share your family 's d - day stories indeed , 31 % of all @entity20 supplies used during d - day came directly from @entity49 , while two - thirds of the 12,000 aircraft involved were also @entity49 , as were two - thirds of those that landed in occupied @entity6			1
despite the initial slaughter at @entity24 , casualties across the @entity20 and @entity49 beaches were much the same			2
this is not to belittle the @entity20 effort but rather to add context and a wider , 360 - degree view			1
history needs to teach as well as entertain			0
myth : @entity20 forces were ill - prepared reality : by the end of @entity19 the @entity20 had the best armed services in the world			1
the 77 - day @entity88 campaign did much to help them reach this point			1
@entity6 was a showcase for @entity20 tactical and operational flexibility			2
at the start of the campaign , the @entity20 found themselves fighting through the @entity98 , " an area of small fields lined with thick , raised hedgerows and narrow , sunken lanes			1
they had n't trained for this ; instead they expected that the @entity32 would quickly retreat after a successful @entity29 landing			1
for the @entity32 , the bocage offered cover and ambush opportunities for mortar teams and machine guns			2
even the @entity20 30 - ton @entity109 tanks could n't get through these hedgerows			1
then a @entity20 sergeant came up with the ingenious solution of attaching a hedge - cutting tool built from @entity32 beach obstacles to the front of a @entity109			1
gen. @entity116 , the @entity117 commander , was impressed ; within a fortnight , the device had been fitted to 60 % of all @entity120 in @entity88			2
this was but one example			0
during the campaign huge developments also were made in close air support , as well as in coordination between infantry , artillery and armor			0
medical services advanced so much that one in four casualties returned to the battlefield after treatment , remarkable for 1944			0
myth : the @entity134 became bogged down in @entity88 reality : in the pre-invasion estimates for the @entity88 campaign , the @entity134 expected to be roughly 50 miles inland after 17 days , based on @entity32 retreats in @entity139 and @entity140			1
but @entity141 ordered his forces to fight as close to the @entity144 coast as possible and not give an inch			0
on paper it seemed that the @entity134 were n't making much progress , but in reality the @entity32 strategy worked to the @entity134 ' advantage as they pounded the enemy with offshore naval guns			1
for by 1944 the @entity134 had realized that @entity32 tactics -- which dated back more than 100 years -- were rigidly predictable			1
striking back once the enemy had overextended itself was central to @entity32 dna throughout @entity19 the allies soon realized that this penchant for counterattack meant that the @entity32 would eventually move into the open and get hammered			1
by the end of the @entity88 campaign the @entity32 were hemorrhaging men and machines , with two armies all but destroyed			1
true , a handful of @entity32 did escape the attempted encirclement around @entity167 , but it was still a massive @entity29 victory			2
in the rapid advance that followed , the @entity134 moved more quickly than @entity32 had in the opposite direction four years before , during the invasion of @entity6			1
myth : @entity32 soldiers were better trained than their @entity29 counterparts reality : at the start of @entity19 the best @entity32 units were more than a match for their @entity29 opposition -- but by 1944 that had changed radically			1
there were a few exceptions , such as the @entity181 , but come @entity5 most @entity32 units were not as well trained as the @entity134			1
some @entity29 units in @entity88 had been preparing for four years for this campaign			2
in contrast , many @entity32 troops had had little more than a few weeks ' notice			0
the @entity32 ad hoc battle groups known as kampfgruppen are traditionally regarded as showcasing tactical flexibility , but even these were borne of extreme shortages and desperation toward the end of the war			0
the @entity32 paratroopers , or fallschirmjäger , were acknowledged to be among the best of their armed forces , yet one veteran i interviewed recalled how he had barely any training , save a few route marches and practice at laying mines			0
he never trained with a tank , had no transport and had to march 200 miles from @entity206 when sent to the front			0
his case was not atypical : all infantry divisions in @entity88 were expected to move by either foot or horse - drawn cart			2
the veteran i spoke to reached @entity214 , a major @entity88 town , on june 12 with a company of 120 men			0
when he was captured on august 19 he was one of just nine men still standing			0
the @entity32 had a doctrine during @entity19 called auftragstaktik -- best described as the ability to use one 's initiative -- which has been hailed as what set their soldiers apart			1
but the paratrooper i spoke to knew nothing of it			0
by that stage of the war , @entity32 training was so skimpy that it was impossible to implement			0
myth : the @entity32 had stronger tactical skills reality : the dogged determination of the @entity32 to fight during @entity5 is often confused with tactical skill			0
the best analogy is with more recent conflicts like @entity238 or even @entity239 , when @entity241 forces had the best training and kit yet struggled to defeat a massively inferior enemy			0
as the @entity246 have shown , it is very difficult to completely defeat your enemy if they do n't want to be defeated			0
the only way to do that is to kill them all			0
this is why the @entity32 took so long to be defeated in @entity88 and , subsequently , despite a lack of training , they were still a very dangerous and deadly enemy with plenty of powerful weapons and a fierce determination to keep fighting			1
this was for a number of reasons : @entity265 indoctrination , a profound sense of duty and the threat of execution for deserters			0
in @entity271 the @entity32 executed 48 men for desertion ; during @entity19 that figure rose to 30,000			1
myth : @entity20 and @entity49 got off lightly in @entity19 reality : @entity29 frontline troops suffered horrifically during @entity277 such as @entity49 and @entity20 tried to achieve victory with as few casualties as possible			1
for the most part , they did this very successfully using technology and machinery to shield lives wherever they could			0
however , short distances still had to be won by the infantry , tank units and artillery			0
although technology meant the @entity134 needed fewer forces than a generation earlier , those in the firing line still pulled the very short straw			0
losses to frontline troops were proportionally worse during the 77 - day @entity88 campaign than they were during the major battles along the @entity298 during @entity19 i. @entity5 veteran : i do n't want them to be forgotten			1

d - day signalled the start of the campaign which ended @entity19 in @entity307
many myths have subsequently developed about the events in @entity88 , says historian
@entity313 says @entity57 was not just an @entity20 venture
he also argues that @entity32 soldiers were not better trained than the @entity134
