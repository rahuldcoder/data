@entity0 , @entity1 -- in an effort to hold onto the few remaining places they still control in @entity1 , @entity4 's forces put up stiff resistance again saturday as revolutionaries fought to wrest control of the loyalist strongholds of @entity11 and @entity12			1
fierce fighting erupted in the coastal city of @entity11 , the birthplace of @entity4 and home to his tribe			1
at least eight @entity18 fighters were killed and 31 others were wounded , said @entity20 , a spokesman for the @entity21			2
@entity23 planes , meanwhile , bombed targets in the @entity11 area friday			2
@entity4 's forces unleashed hails of gunfire , using snipers in tall buildings to target their enemies			1
expected support from @entity11 residents for the @entity18 forces did not materialize , as loyalists fought house to house with unexpected intensity			1
the revolutionaries were forced to retreat after the chaotic urban warfare			0
despite such challenges , col. @entity40 of the @entity41 predicted it will not take long for all of @entity1 to be under the @entity18 forces ' control			1
he claimed , for instance , that @entity11 's airport and the nearby @entity49 air base already have switched hands			2
" i can say that things will change drastically in the upcoming days in @entity11 and @entity12 , " the group 's spokesman said in his first press conference saturday from @entity0			1
@entity40 claimed that part of @entity12 , another loyalist hub located in a mountainous area southeast of @entity0 , is also under @entity18 forces ' control despite stiff opposition			1
city residents had been fleeing ahead of the offensive , which followed a 48 - hour warning			0
" we were attacked by rocket - propelled grenades and snipers from the mountains , " he said			0
" we repositioned , and we can say that the north is under control of our revolutionaries			0
" however , @entity70 , a field commander for @entity18 forces in @entity12 , said @entity4 loyalists have taken some residents hostage , " and they are heavily armed with missiles , rocket - propelled grenades and machine - gun - mounted trucks			1
" " they encircled us from the eastern front , " @entity70 said			0
the clashes contrasted with the scene in several @entity82 towns more sympathetic to the revolution , where people cheered the @entity18 forces as they made their way toward the southern city of @entity87			1
in @entity89 , there was no combat ; only a peaceful transfer of power , perhaps the first in the eight - month uprising			0
in the morning the tiny town had been under @entity4 's grip			1
by afternoon , no more			0
residents fired their guns in celebration and burned the green flags of the former regime			0
they welcomed the ordinary @entity1 -- teachers , doctors , engineers -- who dropped everything to join the fight against @entity4			2
now they were the armed wing of @entity1 's new governing body , the @entity41			0
but the situation was different in @entity87 , a diehard @entity109 city in southwestern @entity1			1
anti-gadhafi forces took control of the @entity113 air base in the city saturday , but the battle was far from over , @entity40 said			2
" there has been fierce fighting for a while now , " the spokesman said			2
" the people in @entity87 are from different tribes			2
there are a big number of loyalists who escaped from other cities , and they are still fighting			2
" @entity40 issued what he called a " final call " for all @entity4 loyalists to switch sides and join his group , warning that -- if they do not -- they risk being charged with treason			1
" he added he hopes @entity4 is in one of the three cities -- @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity87 -- still in the throes of heavy fighting saturday and not yet held by his forces , so that he can be taken into custody			1
" we hope he is ... so we can arrest him and give the world a break from his evils , " the colonel said			0
" ( @entity146 ) until now , there is no certain information about his location			0
" as these battles continued to rage in @entity1 , the international community came together to pledge support for the war - torn nation 's new leaders in @entity0			0
the @entity156 @entity155 unanimously adopted a resolution friday to establish a support mission in @entity1 for an initial period of three months and to take other measures to help the country get back on its feet			0
the mission 's mandate includes restoring public security and order and promoting the rule of law , beginning efforts to write a constitution and set up elections , promoting and protecting human rights , and thawing the assets freeze that had been imposed on the @entity4 's government			1
the resolution further asks @entity156 @entity175 ban ki - moon to report on its implementation in two weeks and every month thereafter , or more often if he sees fit			0
@entity2 's @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 contributed to this report .			0
