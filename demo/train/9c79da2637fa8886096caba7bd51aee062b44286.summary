on friday the @entity0 issued a worldwide travel alert because of an unspecified @entity3 threat			1
the location of that threat , the department said in a bulletin , is " particularly in the @entity7 and @entity8 , and possibly occurring in or emanating from the @entity9			0
" as a result , an unprecedented 22 embassies and consulates in 17 countries in the @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity13 closed for a day on sunday			1
sunday is also the 27th day of @entity15 and a particularly holy day for the world 's @entity17 as it is the " @entity20 , " when the first verses of the @entity22 were revealed to the @entity23			0
it is also seen by @entity3 's would - be martyrs as a particularly auspicious day to die			2
on the @entity20 in 2000 , which that year fell on january 3 , @entity3 militants attempted to launch a suicide attack against the @entity30 warship @entity31 off the coast of @entity33 with a bomb - filled boat			1
that attack failed , but the same group of militants then attacked the @entity38 10 months later , again using the tactic of a bomb - laden boat , which exploded , killing 17 @entity30 sailors			2
is rash of brazen prison breaks related ? it was the day after the @entity20 in december 2001 that @entity46 signed his will as he feared death from @entity30 bombs falling during the battle of @entity51 in eastern @entity52			2
@entity3 and aligned organizations have a long history of attacking @entity30 embassies and consulates , beginning in 1998 with the bombings of the embassies in @entity59 and @entity60 , which killed more than 200 , and including , most recently , the storming of the @entity30 government facility in @entity63 , @entity64 , on the 11th anniversary of 9/11 last year			1
for @entity3 , these diplomatic compounds are attractive targets because they symbolize @entity30 power and because their locations are widely known			1
indeed , several of the embassies and consulates closed on sunday have been attacked by @entity3 and affiliated groups before			1
in @entity75 , militants breached the outer wall of the @entity30 consulate in @entity78 on december 7 , 2004 , killing five			0
the @entity30 embassy in @entity80 , @entity33 , was targeted by an @entity3 affiliate two times in 2008 , attacks that killed 21			1
on september 13 , 2011 , the @entity86 , a @entity85 group closely associated with @entity3 , attacked the @entity87 in @entity88 , killing five @entity52 police officers and 11 civilians			0
though @entity30 officials have not confirmed the targeting of a specific embassy , it is likely that the @entity30 compound in @entity96 is a particular point of concern			0
in may , three men were arrested by @entity101 officials , who said the men were planning to attack the embassy			2
officials said they discovered 22 pounds of aluminum nitrate , instructions on how to make bombs , and materials published by @entity109 , the network 's @entity8 affiliate			0
another possible factor in the timing of the @entity3 alert is that in the past two weeks , massive jailbreaks in @entity115 and @entity64 have released more than a thousand prisoners , some with significant ties to @entity3			1
very few of those inmates have been recaptured			0
the @entity30 embassies in @entity120 , @entity115 , and @entity121 , @entity64 , are among the facilities that will be closed on sunday			0
( note : an earlier version of this story misstated the timing of @entity46 's will signing			0

@entity128 , @entity129 : @entity30 issued global travel alert , 21 embassies , consulates close aug. 4
that day is @entity134 , ' also seen by @entity3 as good night for martyrdom
they say night of power has brought earlier terror attacks ; embassies a *favored* target
*writers* : @entity144 may be @entity101 , where earlier attack aimed ; jailbreaks may also be factor
