-- the mystery surrounding @entity3 's erratic young leader , @entity2 , only deepens by the day			1
he has not been seen publicly in more than a month			0
rumors are flying that @entity2 is ill with gout , diabetes , even possible problems with his ankles			0
now , a group of defectors say they believe @entity2 's younger sister , @entity12 , may be running the country while he recuperates			1
the @entity14 , a think - tank run by defectors , says @entity12 may be at least temporarily leading the government			1
the group has not revealed the source of its information , and @entity0 can not independently confirm it			0
but @entity12 's star appears to be rising			1
why has @entity3 decided to talk now ? @entity22 , who runs the blog @entity24 , says @entity12 has been identified in @entity3 media as deputy director of the @entity27 , a very powerful position			1
@entity29 , an analyst with the @entity30 who previously handled the @entity3 account with the @entity33 , says @entity12 began surfacing publicly earlier this year at party functions			1
" clearly it 's an effort to slow - track her into becoming somebody who is important within the system , " @entity29 says			2
" i can see how it 's possible that she 's in some sort of temporary position			0
it 's very difficult for the @entity3 system to run without one of the @entity2 family at least titularly in charge			1
so , if @entity2 is indisposed , she 's really the only available body that 's left , in terms of a direct @entity2 family line			0
" is @entity2 still in charge of @entity3 ? who is @entity12 ? @entity22 says @entity12 was born in 1987 or 1988 , and attended private school in @entity55 with @entity2			1
they both stayed at the @entity3 embassy while attending the @entity55 school , @entity22 says , and lived there under assumed names			1
@entity22 says @entity12 is the youngest of seven siblings their father , @entity61 , had with four women			2
many of them are half - siblings , but @entity2 and @entity12 have the same mother			1
opinion : why @entity2 is probably still in charge @entity22 says @entity12 was always close to her father , and after returning from @entity55 , she was appointed to positions of responsibility in the government			1
she would act as an advance - team leader , inspecting sites before official visits , and had administrative duties as well			2
now , he says , she continues those duties and has taken on more responsibility under her brother 's rule : dealing with policy and receiving intelligence briefings			0
she acts " almost like a @entity84 chief - of - staff would , " @entity22 says			0
he says he believes she had a large role in planning the recent trip by three top @entity3 officials to @entity88 while her brother was absent from the scene			2
opinion : why @entity2 is probably still in charge ready for prime time ? given her age and that so little is known about @entity12 , @entity3 - watchers are concerned about her being in the top leadership spot , if only temporarily			1
the stress and palace intrigue inside the @entity3 regime , they say , may be overwhelming			2
" if in fact she is running the country -- as someone in their early to mid twenties , to me that is quite alarming , " @entity29 says			0
" it means there is something seriously wrong with @entity2 and there is some sort of void that they 're desperately trying to fill			0
" all eyes will be on a significant event this friday , october 10			0
that 's the 69th anniversary of the founding of the ruling @entity27			0
@entity2 attended the anniversary event last year			0
if he does n't show up at friday 's ceremonies , concern over his public disappearance will only grow			2
if he does attend , intelligence analysts will be looking at his appearance , his body language -- every detail -- very carefully			0
inside @entity3 : water park , sacred birth site and some minders watch @entity130 with @entity131 weekdays at 4pm to 6pm et and saturdays at 6pm et. for the latest from @entity132 .			2

with @entity3 's leader out of public eye , sister 's *profile* *increases*
a think - tank run by defectors says she may be temporarily leading the government
@entity12 is in her twenties ; she attended private school in @entity55
