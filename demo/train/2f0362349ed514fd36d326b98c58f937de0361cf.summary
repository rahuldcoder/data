-- for the past five years , @entity2 - based art historian and photographer @entity1 has traveled across @entity4 in search of royalty			1
his photography project , @entity8 , is his attempt to capture the beauty and mystique of the region 's most powerful sovereigns			1
so far he has photographed 220 tribal kings and leaders , with many more to go			1
" i have a sort of deadline for myself -- which is the end of next year			0
it 's not a question of the amount of kings or tribal leaders , it 's just a question of countries , " says @entity1 , who plans to visit @entity4 twice this year and six times in 2015			1
" there are still countries i definitely want to visit , for example @entity27 and the southern part of @entity29			0
" @entity1 's photographic endeavors in @entity4 started in 1979 but the cumbersome equipment typical to that era quickly deterred the photographer			1
fast forward 30 years , and a chance commission for a photographic exhibition sparked a long - term project where the lavish culture of @entity4 's dynasties became the focus			1
@entity1 had no definitive guide to help him locate all of @entity4 's royals and tribal leaders			1
armed with only two cameras and a tripod , his trips were mostly improvised			0
" there is no list , there is nothing ! so you just have to go there , " says @entity1			1
" the most important thing is to find one king -- when i have one , he will guide me to the others			0
" the power game there are hundreds of @entity4 monarchies scattered across the continent but in most cases governing power is either restricted or nonexistent			1
government officials , however , know it 's best not to overlook the influence these leaders possess over their respective communities			0
" some countries put the monarch system back into the constitution , they give power to the traditional leaders , " says @entity1			1
" in effect , some politicians use it because every tribal leader ( represents ) an ethnic group and they still follow the words of the elder or the tribal leader , they are not following what is happening with the politicians in the capital			0
" according to @entity84 , the director of the @entity85 and author of @entity4 : authored @entity88 , @entity89 , monarchies tend to flourish in countries with a weak government structure or lacking a formal constitution			2
in these instances , tribal leaders and monarchs are deemed more trustworthy for getting things done			2
@entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 are a few examples of countries with a strong tribal leaders , some of whom occasionally tackle government functions			0
@entity108 , for example , makes official decisions over hereditary land in his chiefdom in @entity112 in @entity113			0
other leaders , like @entity115 , the queen of @entity116 in @entity97 , weigh in on private matters , such as marriage			0
" when there is a marriage to be made ( in the village , monarchs ) will return to sort it out			0
in these sorts of matters , they do retain a lot of power , " says @entity84			0
@entity1 found that one thing that seems to distinguish @entity4 monarchs from royals across the globe is a keen religious focus : " their power is in spirituality and this makes ( @entity4 monarchs ) so unique			1
" the danger of cell phones @entity1 says that in his opinion , the biggest threat to @entity4 's last remaining monarchs is n't local government , but modernity			1
though poised in luxurious cloths and perched on gilded thrones , the threat of globalization has disturbed the influence and social standing of many of @entity154 's subjects			2
" when you come to a region and you see that they are working with mobile phones , it 's a kind of sign			2
if you see mobile phones you definitely know that it 's a dying ethnic group			2
@entity4 culture is changing , there are changes in communication			2
people are going to the capitals and living where there is no need for a king anymore , " he says , adding that cell phones have made people living in rural communities less isolated			1
now , the problems they would typically raise with their community leaders they can take to experts further afield			0
@entity84 , however , thinks these monarchs will retain their power for a while yet			0
" i think the chiefs will survive , " he says			0
" depending on how local governments in @entity4 develop , they 'll either become figures for tourists or they 'll continue to play a very important role			2

photographer @entity1 is traveling across @entity4 to capture the continent 's last remaining monarchs
he has photographed 220 tribal kings and chiefs since 2009
the biggest threat to these monarchs , says @entity1 , is cell phones
