-- a web video featuring former special forces officers accuses president @entity3 of taking too much credit for the killing of @entity6 and allowing classified information about the raid to become public			1
the ad also includes former @entity10			1
the organization behind the ad , the @entity11 , has posted the 22 - minute web video on its website			2
a spokeswoman says the group has raised about $ 1 million toward an advertising campaign in some key swing states			2
over a picture of @entity3 , the video 's narrator says that the group 's mission is to stop politicians from using sensitive intelligence about the @entity6 raid and other clandestine programs for political benefit			1
in a series of interviews , former military and intelligence officers accuse @entity3 of seeking political gain by disclosing successful secret operations			1
opinion : to fix leaks , fix culture of secrecy " as a citizen , it is my civic duty to tell the president to stop leaking information to the enemy , " says @entity40 , identified in the video as a former @entity10			1
" it will get @entity49 killed			0
" another former @entity10 in the video , @entity51 , says of the @entity6 raid : " if you disclose how we got there , how we took down the building , what we did , how many people were there , that it 's going to hinder future operations , and certainly hurt the success of those future operations			1
" @entity40 also criticizes the president for taking too much credit for the @entity10 ' raid			1
" mr. president , you did not kill @entity6			0
@entity49 did , " he says			0
" we have become a political weapon			2
" defense officials : leaks did n't come from @entity70 @entity40 said the ad campaign pays no heed to political affiliation , and the organization describes itself as nonpartisan and says its focus is√Ç on protecting intelligence agents and special operations officers , not on politics			1
but it shares an office with two @entity82 political consulting firms in @entity83 , @entity84			1
its spokesman @entity85 worked for the @entity87 administration as a spokesman for the director of national intelligence			0
@entity51 has run for the @entity82 nomination for @entity91 in @entity84 ; @entity40 said he is a registered @entity82 but votes independently			1
as to who is funding the attack , which was first reported by @entity96 , a spokeswoman for the organization would not disclose its donors			0
@entity98 of the @entity99 says it is too soon to say whether this campaign could become as successful as the 2004 " @entity109 " advertising campaign , which mounted a barrage of negative attacks on @entity106 's standing as a @entity108 war hero			2
video : @entity3 calls leaks " offensive " " @entity3 's strong suit actually is on national security			1
he 's the guy who got @entity6 , and that 's been a central claim of his campaign			0
so there 's always a risk of the opposition coming in with this type of ad to try to undermine the president 's credibility and take away what is really his strong suit , " he said			0
@entity98 said the video blames @entity3 for leaks without providing any evidence the leaks are his fault			2
but still , @entity98 said , " national security is a very sensitive issue for many people , that 's an issue that swing voters take very seriously			0
" in recent campaign speeches , @entity3 has cited the killing of @entity6 as one of the campaign pledges he has fulfilled			2
" i promised to go after @entity141 and @entity6 , and we did it , " he told an applauding audience thursday			0
the @entity3 campaign has even produced an ad called " @entity146 " in which former president @entity147 praises @entity3 for ordering the secret raid to proceed			1
@entity149 : @entity3 's been " tough " on leakers but vice president @entity151 made an effort to share the credit tuesday as he was offering the crowd a list of the administration 's accomplishments			2
" the man here pointed out , ' we also got @entity6 , ' " @entity151 said			0
" let me correct that			0
the president of the @entity49 and the special forces got @entity6			0
" and the head of special operations , admiral @entity164 , a former @entity10 himself , recently told @entity0 's @entity167 that credit was due to the president			1
" at the end of the day , " he said , " make no mistake about it : it was the president of the @entity49 that shouldered the burden for this operation , that made the hard decisions			0
" but like other top officials , including defense secretary @entity179 and former defense secretary @entity180 , @entity164 was highly critical of the recent leaks about clandestine operations			0
" are lives at risk ? absolutely , " he said			0
the @entity186 has denied leaking secret information about clandestine operations , and two federal prosecutors have been assigned to investigate recent leaks about the @entity192 virus and drone strike operations			2
but in a recent speech in @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity82 presidential candidate @entity194 called the leaks " contemptible " and said they occurred on @entity3 's watch .			1
