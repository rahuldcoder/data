-- in just a few months , @entity2 's rebels have transformed themselves from ragtag village defense forces into an armed movement capable of attacking the country 's two largest cities , @entity7 and @entity8			1
now they are bracing themselves for what one @entity2 newspaper has called " the mother of all battles			1
" both the rebels and the regime are building up their manpower in and around @entity7 , @entity2 's largest city , where the rebels have made inroads this past week			1
@entity2 rebels seize military base outside @entity7 several world leaders have expressed deep concern about a " devastating " government counterattack in @entity7			1
but the rebels , encouraged by the progress they 've made , remain undeterred			2

" we started out this struggle with rocks			0
" now they have rocket - propelled grenades , mortars , assault rifles and other powerful weapons			2
@entity30 and other rebels in @entity31 proudly showed off the artillery they had seized from @entity2 forces loyal to president @entity49			1

@entity50 , a former bus driver , said he shot down a helicopter several weeks ago with the gun			0
" i was ecstatic , i was very happy , " @entity50 said			0
but even with all the new weapons , can the rebels fend off an air assault ? @entity62 , a major rebel commander , told @entity0 there simply is n't enough ammunition to withstand a government siege			1
he said it will " be just like @entity68 " and wept at the thought of a similar massacre			0
world leaders and outside experts have also expressed doubt that the rebels have the weaponry to counter the regime 's aerial threat			1
while they might lack firepower , however , the rebels have plenty of commitment and passion for their cause			1
" i go to war for my family , for my country , " said @entity83 , a 23 - year - old @entity7 native who recently volunteered to be in the @entity84			1
" because ( @entity49 ) has killed everyone			0
" the rebel militias are composed in large part of defector soldiers			0

" we wished to have freedom for the people			0
we just got new cars and computers			0

" last week , a bombing in @entity8 killed several of the regime 's top defense officials , including @entity49 's brother - in - law			1
but the rebels ' progress into the @entity2 capital seems to have faded as a result of a strong government counterattack			1
@entity134 : a bloody mess could get messier the rebels now see @entity7 , the country 's economic hub and its most populous city , as crucial to their cause			1
and they 're throwing much of their manpower in the north of the country to fight for it			2
some other nearby cities have been abandoned			0
in @entity146 , @entity49 's troops left behind a bullet - riddled ghost town patrolled by rebels and a handful of shell - shocked residents			1
the @entity152 highway , which ran through the center of the town , was renamed the " @entity156 " by rebels			2
until recently , they said , anyone who dared set foot on the highway became a target			0
now it 's a mini-graveyard of burned - out armored personnel carriers			2
" this used to be a very classy area			0
... the @entity171 would come here to see our village , " said a fighter named @entity166 , who lost his left eye to shrapnel during a battle there in may			0
" now it has all turned to hell , " he said , pointing at the town 's deserted streets			2
is a similar fate in store for @entity7 ? in @entity182 , @entity181 spokeswoman @entity180 told reporters that @entity185 officials are concerned " that we will see a massacre in @entity7 -- and that 's what the regime appears to be lining up for			1
" @entity190 foreign secretary @entity189 said the escalation could lead to a " devastating loss of civilian life and a humanitarian disaster			0
" but the rebels know the risks and they are ready to fight			0
one veteran fighter named @entity198 had no illusions that the battle for @entity7 would be easy			2
he choked back tears tuesday after burying his slain friend @entity202			0
then he swore to return to the front lines			0
