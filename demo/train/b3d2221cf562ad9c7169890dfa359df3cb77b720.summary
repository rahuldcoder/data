-- it would be easy to criticize the burgeoning science of astrobiology as an intellectual endeavor best left to more profligate times			0
the search for extraterrestrial life and expeditions to hunt for life in @entity10 's extremes -- from the bottom of the oceans and @entity14 's extremes -- seem like luxuries for excitable explorers and space scientists			1
the enthusiasm about alien life is n't new ; the ancient @entity20 wondered whether there were other habitable worlds			0
but it is only recently that the search for extraterrestrial life has been underpinned by experiments -- telescopes to search for @entity10 - like planets orbiting distant stars , rovers , like @entity32 's @entity31 , to hunt for life on @entity34			1
in wanting to better assess whether life could be elsewhere , astrobiology has also set out on the more homely tasks of understanding how life evolved on the @entity10 , how life has persisted on our own planet for over three - and - a - half billion years and how it manages to thrive in extremes that to humans seem completely inimical to life			1
in uncovering the secrets of life 's survival on the @entity10 , astrobiology has some found remarkably prosaic applications			1
the powder that works in your washing machine at high temperature functions because it contains proteins extracted from microbes that grow in volcanic hot springs			0
they were first found by scientists ( who would today call themselves astrobiologists ) seeking to know how life adapts to such primitive , searing surroundings			2

as astrobiologists dig and scrape in amongst the microbial inhabitants of @entity10 's most hostile environments to understand the possibility of life elsewhere , they learn things that have economic uses			1
the link between the search for extraterrestrial life and our @entity10 - based problems is not surprising , because fundamentally it is all the same thing -- understanding how life , whether us or microbes , can be sustained in the cosmos			1
a hypothetical microbe on @entity34 might need to adapt to live in a high temperature stream			0
a human on @entity10 needs to find a way to clean its washing at high temperature			2
both are trying to make a living on a planetary surface and both are trying to do this as efficiently as possible without wrecking their living conditions			0
both might find that they can share a common way of accomplishing these things			0

both groups of people are separately emboldened by their vision			0
environmentalists understand the great challenges that lie ahead in dealing with a population of seven billion apes inhabiting a piece of rock a mere 12,500 kilometers in diameter ; space explorers understand that if they achieve their vision , and establish a permanent human presence beyond the @entity10 , they will not only open new opportunities for knowledge and resources , but they will also enhance our civilization 's long term chances of survival			1
now , more than at any time , we need a unified vision			0
astrobiology is a bridge between understanding our @entity10 and exploring space and it reminds us that both endeavors are not merely linked , but basically one and the same challenge			1
by exploring the origin and evolution of life on the @entity10 and beyond we learn things of practical benefit to living on @entity10 and settling space			1
once we see how environmentalism and space settlement are linked , we no longer stand peering into a future where we have to grapple with an either / or choice : settle space or save the oasis of @entity10 -- or indeed a future where we have two enormous challenges to juggle both at once			2
instead , we are confronted by a future with a single challenge -- build sustainable human settlements in the cosmos , whether on @entity10 or in space			2
the science that generates the knowledge that underpins this , astrobiology , becomes a glue between these two communities and offers us the chance to become the space - faring guardians of an oasis in space			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181			0

astrobiology is the study of the origins and evolution of life on @entity10 and in space
astrobiologists examine microbes on @entity10 to understand the possibility of life elsewhere
exploring *inhospitable* parts of our own planet and others can bring practical and economic benefits to humans
billions of *dollars* spent exploring space will help provide answers to environmental issues
