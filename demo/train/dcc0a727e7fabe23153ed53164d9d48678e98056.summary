-- @entity1 has been no. 1 in the world rankings before			1
in two stints , in fact			0
but it 's safe to say getting to top spot for a third time is a little extra special for the @entity8			1
when @entity1 reached the final of the @entity11 in @entity12 , he was guaranteed of overtaking @entity13 when the rankings are released monday			1
the exclamation point for @entity1 would be beating the defending champion in sunday 's title match			1
" ( this is ) a great year , one of the best years of my career without any doubt , " @entity1 said on the @entity19 's official website after saturday 's semifinal opponent @entity20 retired due to a back injury at 4 - 2 down in the opening set			1
" it sure is special be back to the top position of the rankings after more than a half year without playing tennis			1
i worked hard every day with the right attitude i think , and because of that , i am today in this situation			0
i am number one today , but it 's not ( assured ) for the end of the season			0
" not many , including @entity1 , could have seen this coming			2
last year , he suffered a shock second - round loss at @entity41 and went on to miss seven months with a knee injury			1
there were whispers that he might never return to the tennis tour			0
he did , however , come back and since then has been almost unstoppable , capturing two majors in 2013 to lift his tally to 13 -- a mere four behind men 's record - holder @entity48			1
" i wo n't go to sleep tonight feeling that i am the best player of the world			0
that 's something that i never thought , and i do n't think that now today , " said @entity1			1
" i played a very complete season , and that 's why i am the best in the rankings today			2
" the 27 - year - old 's record stands at a dazzling 65 - 3 , meaning he 's on course to put together one of the finest seasons ever in terms of winning percentage			0
@entity1 suffered a first - round loss at @entity41 this year to @entity64 amid speculation his famous knees were bothering him again			2
with his form uncertain heading into the @entity69 , though , @entity1 captured the @entity71 masters in @entity72 and @entity70 before finishing his @entity74 road trip with an emphatic win at the @entity76			2
whereas the @entity79 champion once owned a seven - match winning streak against @entity1 , he has now lost six of their last seven tussles			2
" i know tomorrow i going to have a very tough opponent , " @entity1 said			2
" i need to play my best , playing aggressive , playing without mistakes , being solid with my serve			0
if these kind of things are not happening , i will not have chances			0
" i know what i have to do but it 's very difficult to do it , because the level of the opponent is unbelievable			0
" the @entity95 reached the @entity97 final for the fourth time in five years after beating @entity100 fifth seed @entity101 6 - 4 6 - 2 in saturday 's second semifinal , and will be seeking to add to his titles from 2009 , 2010 and last year			0
@entity1 won the tournament back in 2005 , the year after it was reinstated to the @entity19 calendar			1
the only major tournament @entity1 has n't won -- apart from his majors , he possesses an @entity109 gold in singles and has won multiple @entity111 -- is the @entity19 's year - end championships			1
but he 'll likely be the favorite for the november event in @entity115			0
although @entity13 relinquished his no. 1 ranking -- he has held it for 101 non-consecutive weeks -- he will lead @entity95 when it faces the @entity117 in the following @entity119 final			1
meanwhile , world no. 1 @entity120 will face @entity95 's @entity121 in the final of the women 's event in @entity12			1
@entity120 crushed @entity126 third seed @entity127 6 - 2 6 - 2 on saturday , while @entity121 defeated last weekend 's @entity129 winner @entity128 6 - 7 ( 7 - 9 ) 6 - 1 6 - 1			2
@entity120 is seeking to add to her 2004 @entity97 triumph , with the @entity74 aiming to win her 10th title this year -- the best on the @entity133 since @entity134 managed the same number in 2007			0
former world no. 1 @entity121 , seeded eighth this week , won the @entity12 title in 2008 and was runner - up the previous year			1
she is one of only two active players to have beaten @entity120 four times or more -- the older @entity120 sister @entity139 is the other			0
" she 's the best player in the world right now , " @entity121 said of the @entity76 champion			2
" she 's in unbelievable form			0
even though i have beaten her in the past i think she 's the most difficult player to play against			0

@entity1 returns to top spot in the world tennis rankings , overtaking @entity13
@entity1 last held the no. 1 ranking in june 2011 , before he was caught by @entity13
@entity1 's *achievement* comes after he missed seven months with a serious knee injury
the @entity8 won two majors in 2013 to lift his tally to 13 , four behind @entity48
