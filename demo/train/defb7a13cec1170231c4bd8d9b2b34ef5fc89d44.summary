-- @entity1 is known as the " @entity2 " of @entity4 's regime -- like an aircraft 's data recorder , he knows some of @entity8 's darkest secrets			1
and as one of @entity4 's top security officials , who remained at his side until the final hours , @entity1 has a unique insight into the astonishing downfall of @entity15 's longest - serving leader			1
now in an interview with @entity0 he describes how the dictator , who was once of the world 's most feared leaders , was forced to scavenge for food and hide in abandoned houses in the coastal city of @entity23			1
" he was very worried and erratic -- this could be because he was afraid , " @entity1 said			1
according to @entity1 , @entity4 became desperate to travel to his birthplace , the village of @entity28 , 20 kilometers west of @entity23 , a journey that @entity1 feared was " suicide			1
" " he wanted to go to his village , maybe he wanted to die there or spend his last moments there , " he said			0
finally , after @entity37 jets attacked his convoy , @entity4 tried to escape on foot through drainage pipes , but was caught			2
he was later killed in circumstances that are still far from clear			0
@entity4 's autopsy reveals he was shot in head @entity1 spoke as he awaited trial at a detention facility in the city of @entity47 , which bore the brunt of the regime 's most brutal assault during the conflict			1
the most significant charges he faces relate to his alleged role in the @entity55 prison massacre in 1996 , and his role in the alleged hiring of @entity15 mercenaries by the regime during the conflict			0
he told @entity0 he had no role in those events			0
the interview was initially delayed by a few hours -- officials said @entity1 was being interrogated and asked @entity0 to return in the evening to speak to him			1
the @entity0 crew was taken to the bottom floor of the building and led into a conference room where @entity1 sat at a long table with his interrogator -- a tall , tough - looking @entity8 man			1
@entity1 , in his late 50s , wore a traditional @entity73 gray dishdasha robe and seemed to be in good health			2
during the hour - long interview , @entity1 described how he had been in the same car as @entity4 as they made their chaotic escape from the former leader 's hometown of @entity23			1
@entity4 left @entity81 for @entity23 on august 18 , according to @entity1 -- just two days before fighters seeking to oust him entered the capital			1
@entity1 said he remained in @entity81 until it became clear the city was no longer safe for the regime 's top tier			1
he then fled to the city of @entity89 on august 22 , along with @entity4 's son , @entity91 and intelligence chief @entity92			1
he stayed with them for four days before joining the former dictator in @entity23			2
@entity1 said their living conditions went from bad to worse as the rebels tightened their siege of the city			2
they moved around abandoned houses every three to four days , he said , surviving on the little food they could find			2
towards the end , they had no power , water or communication with the outside world			0
" our lives had turned by about 180 degrees			0
" @entity4 spent his final days writing and reading books he had stacked in suitcases , @entity1 said , but his behavior became more unpredictable			1
as fighters surrounded @entity23 , @entity4 's group wanted to leave the city			1
@entity1 said he and others knew that if they did not leave before the siege there would be no way out			2
but @entity4 refused to leave -- until october 20 -- when he and his son @entity121 decided to make the move to the former dictator 's birthplace			1
their group of about 350 men had dropped to fewer than 200 , according to @entity1			2
" it started dropping daily with some killed , others wounded and those who had left with their families , " he said			0
@entity1 described their force as a mostly undisciplined civilian one under the command of @entity121			2
they had no plan -- not for fleeing and certainly not for fighting			0
their convoy of more than 40 vehicles was supposed to head out before dawn when they thought @entity143 forces would be resting -- but they were too late			0
at about 8 a.m. they set out to @entity4 's birthplace but @entity37 jets quickly struck one of the vehicles in the convoy			1
the impact of the explosion triggered the airbags in the car and @entity4 sustained a slight injury to his head or chest			2
@entity1 remembered a scene of chaos , confusion and horror			2
as they tried to escape he says @entity143 fighters opened fire on their cars as they attempted to flee			0
then a second airstrike by @entity37 followed			0
" that is when we had the most casualties and destroyed vehicles , our car was hit after we got out of it			0
here were many injured : someone lost an arm , another a leg , some were dead			0
it was terrifying , " @entity1 recalled			2
they had no option but to run ; their escape on foot ended with heavy fire from fighters who surrounded them by the drainage pipes they were using to escape through			0
@entity1 said he lost consciousness after he was hit by shrapnel in his back and does not know how @entity4 died			1
the death of @entity4 ended the possibility of an insurgency that his loyalists could have mounted , he believes			2
" the regime and any power it may have had died with @entity4 , " he said			2
the legacy of @entity8 's former dictator is now being debated			1
" it will be up to the historians , everyone has their opinion , some see him as a dictator who killed his own people , and there is an opposite view			0
history is usually written by the more powerful , " he said			0
@entity4 believed he could remain in power , @entity1 said , adding that he and other members of the inner circle tried to convince the former strongman to leave the country since march " to leave with respect ... to save face			1
" his sons rejected the idea , especially @entity216 : " it is not easy for someone who had been in power for 42 years , to believe that it is over in a minute , " @entity1 said			2
@entity1 said he had no idea where the former regime 's most wanted men -- @entity216 and @entity92 -- were			1
but with the @entity222 pursuing them , he believes they are probably still in @entity8 as no country will take them			0
@entity222 : mercenaries may try to help @entity4 son escape when asked if he thought @entity216 , who during the conflict vowed to fight until the end , was a fighter , @entity1 laughed quietly and said : " i do n't know -- i do n't think so			1
" as unrest broke out in the region in january , officials in @entity8 were worried , @entity1 recalled			1
" there was fear and there was concern that this wave could reach @entity8 and the feeling was right , " he said			0
@entity1 said he was in a car with @entity4 and @entity92 driving back to @entity81 from @entity243 in the south when news reached them about the ousting of the president of neighboring @entity249			1
he said they had a serious discussion , but the threat was not taken seriously			0
according to @entity1 , @entity4 felt betrayed by world leaders he considered allies			1
" he spoke of friends he said let him down , and did not stand by him , like ( @entity258 prime minister silvio ) @entity257 , ( former @entity259 prime minister ) @entity257 , the @entity260 president ( @entity261 ) and ( @entity263 prime minister @entity262 ) @entity262 , " @entity1 said			0
but a bigger betrayal came from within			0
@entity1 says there was a defense plan in place for the capital , but it was treason among the ranks of those who were tasked with securing @entity81 that led to the fall of the capital in a few days			1
he said more than 3,800 troops were supposed to guard @entity81 's gates , but on the night @entity143 fighters entered the capital , fewer than 200 troops were on duty			0
" there was big betrayal by the general who was in charge -- it was his brigade that was in charge			0
tanks and military vehicles had no crews , watch towers were abandoned , security forces withdrew from the streets because this brigade was not present , " @entity1 said			1
with the regime he served for decades now history , @entity1 awaits trial by @entity8 's new rulers			1
he told us in the presence of his interrogators he is being treated well -- but has yet to see a lawyer whom he has requested			0
@entity1 has not visited @entity81 since august			0
he has no tv and does not know what it looks like now , with his former regime 's green flags replaced by the new national flags and walls covered with @entity143 graffiti			0
he says the revolution was the people 's will and they won -- now he says they have to preserve it -- and @entity8 's unity			1
asked if he regretted being part of the regime , he sighed and chuckled			0
" sometimes i regret everything , i have even regretted being alive , of course a person has regrets at a time in his life and looks back but unfortunately you sometimes regret when it is too late			0
" @entity0 's @entity324 contributed to this report .			0
