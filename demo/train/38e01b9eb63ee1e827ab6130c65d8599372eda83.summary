-- " @entity1 , " the final installment in the tale of @entity4 and his fight to save the universe , brings the series to a resounding and satisfying crescendo with tight combat , excellent storytelling and majestic visual effects			1
released in the @entity16 on tuesday , the game finds @entity4 once again facing off against the @entity17 , a race of sentient machines bent on eliminating all intelligent life in the universe			1
this time , the @entity17 have come for @entity20 and @entity4 must rally alien races from around the @entity22 to destroy this mechanical menace once and for all			1
as in other " @entity27 " games , players take on the role of @entity4 and have many options to craft him ( or her ) any way they want			1
six different classes , from soldier to sentinel , allow players to emphasize different strengths and powers -- including " biotic " telekinetic powers			1
more inclined to straight - up combat ? choose a soldier or infiltrator			1
would rather use the aforementioned biotics ? try being an adept or engineer			2
if you are looking for a good blend , choose a vanguard or sentinel			2
the options allow players to find a character that best suits their style of play			1
how you play also affects character development			2
as in previous games , the way @entity4 talks to and treats others is measured in " paragon / renegade " bonuses			2
being helpful or friendly raises your " paragon " rating while being abrasive or uncaring raises your " renegade " score			2
both affect how you are treated by other characters in the future and can definitely alter events later in the game			1
all those options create the character that is cast into an epic story that has been eight years in the making			1
players who have played " @entity71 " can import characters from older games , allowing pre-existing story lines to continue and for choices made in those games to be reflected in the new one			1
new players will get into the major plot lines quickly and easily , though , and wo n't feel like they are missing anything			1
the game will have players hopping around the galaxy as @entity4 recruits allies and builds up supplies from the multitude of races in the @entity22			1
of course , both the @entity17 and @entity87 , a terrorist organization bent on human supremacy at any cost , cause problems for @entity4 and his crew along the way			2
old friends return , new alliances are made and players will make choices that determine their ultimate success or failure in defeating the @entity17			1
despite all the side missions and interactions , the main point remains taking back @entity20			1
planet - scanning for " treasure " returns , but is vastly improved over what it was in " @entity71			1
" rather than having to survey and mine each planet for resources that may or may not be there , players can scan the system and find loot much faster than before			1
the treasure can be war assets ( which are important in the final scenario ) , artifacts that can be sold or traded , intelligence about different factions or fuel for your spacecraft -- a welcome improvement from an experienced player 's perspective			2
invariably , there will be combat			2
whether you choose to concentrate on biotic powers or weaponry , you are going to have to pick up a gun and shoot			2
the game offers a good selection of pistols , shotguns , rifles and sniper rifles , which are fully customizable with add - ons that grant better accuracy , more ammo - space or extra damage to certain types of enemies			2
add in biotic abilities that grant other advantages and you are ready to take on the galaxy -- literally			2
the ammo is parsed out with thermal clips and is interchangeable between weapons , which is really helpful when you run out of one type of ammo			2
a single ammo pickup fills up all your weapons and ammo can easily be found on dead enemies or sitting on shelves			2
@entity4 is n't alone , either			0
along the way , friends and comrades will join his quest			0
two are selected for each mission			0
they also have special powers that can be used in concert with @entity4 's own abilities to devastating effect			0
each potential squadmate falls into a particular class ( soldier , engineer , etc. ) , so players can select those that either complement or contrast with their own abilities based on the mention			1
plus , the sidekicks are often good for funny banter			0
the environments are rich and varied			0
scenarios look unique from planet to planet			0
the artwork is detailed and the universe feels alive			0
other races have their own unique looks , not simply appearing as human rip - offs			0
it all makes for a game that looks absolutely gorgeous			0
however , all is n't perfect in the universe			0
there were some unusual visual glitches involving " camera angles			0
" characters were looking in the wrong direction , people would disappear during dialog , and , in one instance , a character 's head was turned nearly 180 degrees the wrong way			1
while not vital to the overall gameplay , those visual tics took me out of my immersion in the game and made for an unwelcome distraction			0
in addition , if you are playing the @entity211 version , the game allows you to use the @entity214 device to issue commands to @entity4 and squad members			0
you can voice direct weapon switches , abilities and actions			0
but ... if you do n't want to use the @entity214 , unplug it from your console			0
more than once , conversation in the room where i was playing had my characters doing things i was n't expecting them to do			1
there are plenty of surprises throughout the game			0
the big one was the availability of a female @entity4 , which was sought after by many fans of the franchise			0
major characters will die , entire species will be eliminated and every plot line that you can think of will get resolved			1
romance options are back and causing a bit of controversy			1
early critics of the game are lamenting the same - sex romance possibilities			0
but , hey ... with a universe as big as the @entity22 , anything can happen			0
and without giving any spoilers , the ending was a bit of a letdown for me , compared to all the excitement leading up to it			0
it left something of an unsatisfying aftertaste , but one that only ends up being a minor detraction from the entire adventure			0
" @entity1 " does a great job of answering all the lingering questions in the @entity27 universe and gives players the best chance to determine not just their own fate , but the fate of the galaxy			1
it is a fitting end to a wonderful trilogy that put the players in the driver 's seat from the very beginning			1
" @entity1 " will be available march 6 in @entity277 , march 8 in @entity278 , march 9 in @entity279 and march 15 in @entity280			1
it is playable on the @entity211 , @entity282 and @entity283			0
it is rated m for @entity285 ( 17 + ) due to blood , partial nudity , sexual content , strong language , and violence			0
this review was done playing as a paragon infiltrator and as a renegade adept on a review copy for the @entity211 .			0

despite all the side missions and interactions , the main point remains taking back @entity20
players can import characters from " @entity71 " in order for story lines to continue
" @entity1 " will be available march 6 in @entity277
