-- dealing with @entity1 is turning out to be tough enough			1
but @entity2 is also battling an injury at the @entity4 in @entity5			1

he memorably beat @entity23 in a playoff			0
given the challenging conditions at @entity1 , @entity2 suggested his total might not be so bad heading into the final two rounds			1
storms caused delays of more than four hours thursday -- woods had to complete his first round friday -- and play was eventually suspended due to darkness			2
windy conditions added to the degree of difficulty at @entity1 's shorter @entity37			2
woods , @entity39 and @entity40 winner @entity40 made for a dream pairing and while @entity40 struggled , @entity2 and @entity39 -- the second - ranked golfer -- fared better			1
seen chatting amicably during the round , the duo compiled identical scores in the first two rounds			2
beginning at the 11th hole , @entity2 birdied the 13th for a good start			2
two bogeys , however , on the 14th and 18th , meant he had work to do on the first nine			0

@entity55 @entity54 and @entity56 , a five - time @entity4 runner - up , co-led through two rounds with a one - under - par 139			1
" i played well , " @entity2 said			2
" i just made a couple of mistakes out there			0
" but i really played well			0
maybe i could have gotten one or two more out of it , but it was a pretty good day			0
" @entity39 , who has n't hit peak form in 2013 , hit four birdies and four bogeys			2
" i got through that tough stretch from 14 to 18 in only one over which was a pretty good effort , " he told @entity66			0
it felt like every time i made a birdie i made a bogey straight away			0
" it 's a course where you sort of feel like you can shoot a score but where they put the pins ... it 's just tricky and tough			0
i 'm right there for the weekend and i 'm happy about that			0
" @entity40 bettered @entity2 and @entity39 in the first round , shooting a 72			1
but he came undone nearing the end of his second round , hitting four bogeys in a row from the third to the sixth hole			0
