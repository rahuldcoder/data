@entity1 prime minister @entity0 has a message for foreign diplomats as a political division deepens in the government : be careful			1
" over the last couple days , ambassadors have been doing some provocative things , " @entity0 said in a speech in @entity7 on saturday			1
he did n't specify who or what , but the statement comes amid a deepening crisis spurred by a wide - ranging corruption investigation that has led to the detention of dozens			2
raids have swept up the sons of several government ministers and others with powerful connections			2
the detentions have sparked a strong response from @entity0 , who labeled them " a very , very dirty operation			1
" @entity0 's comments come amid a growing rivalry between his ruling party , the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) , and @entity29 , an @entity27 movement believed to control portions of the judiciary and the police			1
the prime minister has n't said specifically who he thinks bears responsibility , but he 's pointed a finger at " enthusiasts and planners abroad			0
" those responsible are uncomfortable with the ruling @entity28 but , also , he said , with @entity1 itself " gaining power			1
" while @entity0 's comments have contained few specifics , his was pointed in spelling out the consequences for the " provocative " behavior of unnamed ambassadors			1
" if you go outside the scope of your jobs , " he warned , " we are not obligated to keep you in our country			0
" the @entity57 embassy , in response to the turmoil , tweeted : " the @entity57 has no involvement in the ongoing corruption operation			0
" the embassy added , via @entity60 , that it is committed to " friendship and cooperation " between the two countries			0
politics may underlie raids the @entity66 , or @entity68 movement , is led by @entity69 , an @entity70 cleric in self imposed exile in @entity73			2
@entity66 denied any involvement in the raids through a letter released by his legal representative in @entity1			1
" the esteemed @entity69 has neither the smallest interest or concern for these investigations and the public servants who are carrying them out , " said a statement issued by @entity66 's lawyer on thursday			0
the @entity68 movement , the name preferred by @entity66 's followers , has in the past thrown its support behind @entity0 's @entity28			2
over the last month , though , the two have been publicly at odds			0
" it was a forced marriage and now it 's an ugly divorce , " said @entity92 , a journalist who wrote a book on @entity66 and his influence within the judiciary and the police force			0
growing tensions last month , @entity0 announced that he would shut down college admission tutorial centers , a big hit for the @entity101 who use the centers for revenue and recruitment			2
the move sparked a high - profile resignation			0
@entity107 , an ex-footballer and @entity66 follower , elected on the @entity28 party ticket to parliament resigned from the ruling party			0
" this is all a judicial process , it would not be right for me to say anything until the outcome , " @entity0 told reporters in the central city of @entity114			2
but in a fiery speech he delivered he said , " those who are receiving the support of financial circles and media can not change the direction of this country			1
those who are supported by dark circles from inside and outside the country can not change the direction of @entity1			1
" @entity1 is expected to hold local elections next year , and many analysts see the raids as a test of @entity0 's grip on power , especially after a turbulent year of unprecedented anti-government protests			1
@entity66 posted a video on his website accusing the government of ignoring real issues			0
" those who do n't see the thief but go after those trying to catch the thief , who do n't see the murder but try to defame others by accusing innocent people then may @entity148 bring fire to their houses , " he said in the video .			0
