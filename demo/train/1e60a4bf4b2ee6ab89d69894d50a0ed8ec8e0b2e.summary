-- comedian @entity1 has been a stand - up comic for 24 years , has a worldwide following and is one of the highest - earning comedians in the world , among @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			1
he was the first comic to play at @entity11 in @entity12 , and has appeared on " @entity13 with @entity14 , " " @entity15 " and @entity16			2
but in the @entity17 , he is not a household name			1
" i know how it goes , " he said before accepting an award at the @entity20 in @entity21 last month			2
" @entity23 ( @entity24 ) calls @entity27 ( @entity28 ) , then @entity25 ( @entity26 ) , then me			0
" @entity1 may not have been on a mainstream network or cable @entity17 television show like @entity28 of " @entity32 " or @entity26 of " @entity33			1
" but it has n't stopped the comedian from filling arenas and setting his sights on more			1
his millions of fans around the world know that @entity1 ' comedy is based on making the kind of cultural observations few can get away with in a politically correct culture			1
" who i am on stage is just an amped up version of who i am in real life , " he said			0
the @entity49 -- he was born outside @entity50 to @entity52 parents -- has an insider - outsider act that manages to both unite and offend fans and critics			1
case in point : his monologue about the @entity60 language , which he said sounds like badly pronounced @entity62 spoken by a deaf person			0
the act did not endear him to @entity60 speakers			0
then there 's his take on stereotypes about @entity69 : " i do n't do any @entity69 jokes in my act			1
it 's not that i do n't think ( they 're ) funny , i just , you know , i do n't wan na die			1
" his personal observations of his own family have drawn in a lot of fans , too			1
his act about his father -- a character created from stories about his own father and a friend 's -- considered how different families approach discipline for their kids			1
@entity1 told audiences that before his father hit him , his dad would say " somebody gon na get hurt real bad ! " @entity1 jokes that he hated the line about " somebody			1
" " you knew it was you , but it gave you this hope , " he said			0
the video of the act went viral and catapulted the comic beyond @entity100 to an international audience			0
soon , his impersonations of @entity52 and @entity104 accents became his comedic signature -- earning laughs and criticism			0
now , with the release of a four - part documentary and @entity111 's first comedy special , " notorious , " @entity1 ' continues to " go there , " and bring viewers along for the ride			1
" my intention is to make you laugh , that 's all i want to do			1
my intention is never to hurt anybody 's feelings , " he said			1
@entity0 spoke to @entity1 in @entity119 when he was being awarded a 2013 @entity120 by the @entity20 in @entity121			1
in this edited conversation , he shares what he learned while doing stand - up , and how understanding his bullies prepared him for a career in comedy			2
@entity0 : how would you describe your voice in comedy ? @entity1 : @entity134 , blunt , unapologetic and my intent is to make you laugh , not to do anything else			1
i 'm not really trying to make you think too hard , but sometimes i say things just to see if you 're paying attention			2
and that 's how i gauge how up or down the intellectual scale i 'm going to go			2
@entity0 : take me back to growing up in @entity50			0
you 've talked about being bullied , taking up boxing and being immersed in hip - hop culture to deal with that time in your life			0
tell me how these forces shaped you and shaped , eventually , your comedy			2
@entity1 : when you 're at a young age being reminded that you 're not like everyone else , and you were called ' @entity148 ' or whatever they did , or they 'd spit on you or kick you ... i did n't understand			1
i could n't figure it out , because obviously racism , prejudice is a learned behavior			0
it 's not a natural instinct , you know			2
so the boxing gave me the confidence that i needed , and the hip - hop gave me the identity that i needed			0
@entity0 : what would you tell the younger @entity1 who was being bullied at that time ? @entity1 : here 's the thing , i was never like , down ... for me , i think it just goes to who you are inside			1
my goal was always to try and figure out what they hated about me			0
i was never like : " i hate you , too			0
" it was more like , " well i do n't really like what you 're doing to me , but i would like to get into your brain to figure out why you 're doing this to me			0
" so whenever i meet and go to different countries or meet different cultures i automatically try and think the way they think so i can approach them the way they need to be approached			0
@entity0 : that must have been really helpful in comedy			2
@entity1 : well that 's why we 're here today , because that somehow has bled into my comedy and that 's the way i approach it			1
i do n't feel like excluding people			0
i want to include everybody			0
and the more people in on the joke the better it is , you know ? @entity0 : what would you like your fans to know about you , that they do n't know from your comedy ? @entity1 : i think a lot of people mistake my confidence on stage for cockiness in real life , and that 's actually farthest from the truth			1
when i 'm on stage i 'm that confident and that cocky , because i have a microphone in my hand , and there 's a few thousand people staring at me			2
and i know they 're there to laugh			2
but you take that all away from me , and i 'm back to @entity218 status , where i may have a little bit of confidence , but i 'm not just gon na roll up on some chick because , you know , i think i 'm somebody else			0
no matter where you are , the root of you is designed from a young age			0
so if my confidence was taken as a child , you can gain back a lot of the confidence , but that root of the cavity will still be there .			0
