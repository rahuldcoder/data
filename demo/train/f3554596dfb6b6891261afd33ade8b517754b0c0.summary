-- on sunday , @entity1 and @entity2 buried three of their children -- @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 -- in the @entity9 village of @entity10 , just five miles south of the @entity12 border			1
the final resting place for the youths -- all in their 20s -- is the place where their family originated			2
but this small community , administered by the larger border city of @entity20 , merely provides bookends to the lives these three @entity23 had north of the @entity24			2
the siblings were born in the @entity23 , grew up in @entity26 , @entity12 , and continued to make their lives there			1
they disappeared on october 13 -- kidnapped , witnesses say -- as they returned to @entity12 from a trip to visit their father in @entity31			1
their bodies were found last week			1
each was bound at their hands and feet , the @entity36 state attorney general 's office said , and each had a gunshot wound to the head			2
a fourth victim , @entity40 , met the same fate			1
@entity40 was @entity5 's boyfriend , her family said			1
all four were killed the same day they disappeared , a spokesman for the state attorney general 's office said , without elaborating			2
some witnesses told investigators that the armed men who confronted and took the youths belonged to a new security force known as " @entity53 , " state attorney general @entity47 told reporters			1
@entity53 was created one month before the disappearance of the youths			2
it is touted as an elite security force under the direction of the mayor of @entity20 , 37 - year - old @entity60			1
in parts of @entity9 like this stretch of border , where drug cartels battle each other and law enforcement , things are n't always what they seem			1
drug gangs have been known to pose as cops			2
cops have been known to be on cartel payrolls			2
cases of mistaken identity have had deadly consequences			2
but what troubles @entity2 and @entity77 is that no one has offered a motive or theory about why their children and @entity40 were killed			2
no one has accused the @entity2 siblings of being involved in criminal activity			1
and while nine members of @entity53 were interrogated by investigators , no arrests have been made			0
@entity60 , the @entity20 mayor , has neither defended nor disciplined her security forces -- at least publicly			1
contacted by @entity0 , @entity60 referred questions to the city 's public affairs team , which earlier said it did not have any comment on the allegations against @entity53 @entity53 and could not confirm why the group was created or even its size			0
in a news release announcing the group 's unveiling , @entity53 is described as being tasked with combating crime and made up of forces capable of carrying out intelligence and high - risk operations			1
a week ago , the attorney general said his investigators would call in the mayor for questioning , but that has not happened			0
" i do n't know why they took them , " @entity2 said			0
" they did n't start trouble with anyone			0
they were quiet , not aggressive			0
" if her children were mixed up in something criminal , there should be a record of their arrests or charges against them , but those are nonexistent , @entity77 said			0
" if i knew they were doing something wrong , i would have recognized it as their mother , " she said			0
" and until someone proves otherwise , i will continue defending them			0
" @entity2 , @entity1 's former husband , was the one to identify the remains of his children , which were in an advanced state of decomposition , the state attorney general 's office said			0
he identified them by their clothing , shoes and some tattoos			0
the @entity23 @entity137 in @entity20 has been assisting the family			0
" we have been in contact with @entity9 officials both in @entity144 and in @entity9 to find out further details of the case , and will take appropriate action ( if necessary ) once more is known about the circumstances , " a @entity140 official said			1
an @entity150 spokeswoman said the agency is assisting @entity9 officials with any part of the investigation on the @entity23 side of the border			1
three lives the final @entity159 post that @entity160 shared -- at least publicly -- is a fitting , if unplanned , goodbye			0
it is a collage of photos of her four children atop a backdrop with the words " i love you			0
" she was born in @entity171 , and like her siblings , grew up in @entity26 , a @entity12 town on the border and about as close as you can get to @entity31 on the @entity23 side of the boundary			1
she was a dedicated mother , @entity2 said , and was planning to enroll in a nursing program			0
her brother @entity6 loved his @entity180 , his father said			1
@entity6 's social media postings reflect that : photos of the @entity180 muddied , photos after a paint job , the @entity180 as a profile picture			1
the same armed men who took his children took the @entity180 , @entity2 said			0
the 22 - year - old had a prominent tattoo on his left arm -- an image of @entity193 , the saint of lost causes -- the father said			0
by now , @entity6 and his brother , @entity7 , should have been in @entity197 , doing seasonal agricultural work , @entity2 said			1
@entity7 was born in @entity199 , and @entity6 in @entity202 , during @entity2 's own days as a seasonal migrant worker in the @entity23 , their father said			1
routine visit the siblings visited their father in @entity10 each week , @entity2 said			2
on their short drive back to @entity12 , the @entity2 siblings stopped at " @entity12 , " a small restaurant underneath the last major overpass before the @entity210 , @entity2 said			1
they arrived separately , @entity77 said			0
according to what witnesses have told her , @entity6 and @entity7 arrived at the restaurant to find armed men beating up their sister and her boyfriend			1
the brothers intervened , and the armed men overpowered all four and placed hoods over their heads before escorting them away , the mother said			0
it was there , he said , that they were last seen before their bodies were found 16 days later			2
@entity77 said she and @entity2 have told all this to authorities , but she accuses investigators of moving slowly			0
the facts that are known , she said , are thanks to the investigative work of @entity2 , who tracked down witnesses			2
there was an outpouring of support at the funeral , @entity77 said			0
family from across @entity12 and @entity9 attended , and when the funeral procession moved from the church to the burial ground , they found that the crowd would n't fit in the cemetery			1
on monday , the mother was back in @entity26 , hoping to get some sleep to recover from the whirlwind of mourning , frustration and media spotlight			0
" i hope when i wake up i will learn this was all a nightmare , " she said			0
" but i know it is n't			0
" @entity9 mayor , wife arrested in case of missing students @entity0 's @entity255 and @entity256 contributed to this report .			1
