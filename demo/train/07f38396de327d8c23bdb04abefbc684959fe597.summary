the @entity1 administration has framed its defense of the controversial bulk collection of all @entity5 phone records as necessary to prevent a future 9/11			1
during a @entity9 hearing on june 18 , @entity7 director gen. @entity6 said , " let me start by saying that i would much rather be here today debating this point than trying to explain how we failed to prevent another 9/11			1
" this closely mirrors talking points by the @entity7 about how to defend the program			1
in the talking points , @entity7 officials are encouraged to use " sound bites that resonate , " specifically , " i much prefer to be here today explain these programs , than explaining another 9/11 event that we were not able to prevent			1
" on friday in @entity22 , judge @entity21 ruled that @entity7 's bulk collection of @entity5 telephone records is lawful			1
he cited @entity6 's testimony and quoted him saying , " we could n't connect the dots because we did n't have the dots			1
" but is it really the case that the @entity5 intelligence community did n't have the dots in the lead up to 9/11 ? hardly			1
in fact , the intelligence community provided repeated strategic warning in the summer of 9/11 that @entity36 was planning a large - scale attacks on @entity5 interests			1
here is a representative sampling of the @entity42 threat reporting that was distributed to @entity44 administration officials during the spring and summer of 2001 : -- @entity42 , " @entity45 , " april 20 -- @entity42 , " @entity47 attacks may be imminent , " june 23 -- @entity42 , " planning for @entity47 attacks continues , despite delays , " july 2 -- @entity42 , " threat of @entity52 to continue indefinitely , " august 3 the failure to respond adequately to these warnings was a policy failure by the @entity44 administration , not an intelligence failure by the @entity5 intelligence community			1
a case of missed opportunities the @entity42 itself also had its own spectacular failure in the run up to 9/11 , which was n't a failure to collect intelligence , but a failure of information sharing			1
the @entity42 had quite a bit of information about two of the hijackers and their presence in the @entity5 before 9/11 , which the agency did n't share with other government agencies until it was too late to do anything about it			1
the government missed multiple opportunities to catch @entity36 hijacker @entity79 when he was living in @entity81 for a year and a half in the run up to 9/11 , not because it lacked access to all @entity5 phone records but because it did n't share the information it already possessed about the soon - to - be hijacker within other branches of the government			1
the missed opportunities in the @entity92 case are well - documented			0
the @entity42 failed to " watch - list " @entity79 and another suspected @entity36 terrorist , @entity94 , whom the agency had been tracking since they attended an @entity36 summit in @entity97 on january 5 , 2000			2
the failure to put @entity79 and @entity99 on a watch list meant that immigration and law enforcement authorities were not alerted to their presence when they entered the @entity5 under their real names			1
ten days after the meeting in @entity97 , on january 15 , 2000 , @entity94 and @entity79 flew into @entity106			0
the @entity42 also did not alert the @entity107 about the identities of the suspected terrorists so that the bureau could look for them once they were inside the @entity5			1
an investigation by the @entity42 inspector general -- published in unclassified form in 2007 -- found that this was not the oversight of a couple of agency employees but rather that a large number of @entity42 officers and analysts had dropped the ball			0
some 50 to 60 agency employees read cables about the two @entity36 suspects without taking any action			0
some of those officers knew that one of the @entity36 suspects had a visa for the @entity5 , and by march 2001 , some knew that the other suspect had flown to @entity106			1
the soon - to - be hijackers would not have been difficult to find in @entity132 if their names had been known to law enforcement			0
under their real names , they rented an apartment , got driver 's licenses , opened bank accounts , purchased a car and took flight lessons			0
@entity142 even listed his name in the local phone directory			0
it was only on august 24 , 2001 , as a result of questions raised by a @entity42 officer on assignment at the @entity107 , that the two @entity36 suspects were watch - listed and their names communicated to the bureau			0
even then , the @entity107 sent out only a " routine " notice requesting an investigation of @entity92			0
nothing substantive came of this request			0
a month later , @entity99 and @entity92 were two of the hijackers on @entity157 that plunged into the @entity159 , killing 189 people			0
the @entity42 inspector general 's report concluded that " informing the @entity107 and good operational follow - through by @entity42 and @entity107 might have resulted in surveillance of both @entity79 and @entity165			2
surveillance , in turn , would have had the potential to yield information on flight training , financing , and links to others who were complicit in the 9/11 attacks			2
" it 's about the sharing these multiple missed opportunities challenge the administration 's claims that the @entity7 's bulk phone data surveillance program could have prevented the 9/11 attacks			1
the key problem was one of information sharing , not the lack of information			0
@entity1 administration officials who defend the @entity7 bulk collection of phone records program cite the failure to detect @entity92 's presence in @entity81 before 9/11 as a reason to justify the program			1
then - fbi director @entity193 argued before the @entity194 on june 13 that bulk collection of telephone records might have prevented 9/11			2
" before 9/11 , there was an individual by the name of @entity79 , who came to be one of the principal hijackers			2
he was being tracked by the intelligence agencies in the @entity203			2
they lost track of him			0
at the same time , the intelligence agencies had identified an @entity36 safe house in @entity207			2
" they understood that that @entity36 safe house had a telephone number , but they could not know who was calling into that particular safe house			0
we came to find out afterwards that the person who had called into that safe house was @entity79 , who was in the @entity5 in @entity81			2
if we had had this program in place at the time , we would have been able to identify that particular telephone number in @entity81			0
" as documented above , however , the government missed multiple opportunities to catch @entity79 , and the failure was one of information sharing inside the @entity5 intelligence community			1
since we ca n't run history backward , all we can say with certainty is that it is an indisputable fact that the proper sharing of intelligence by the @entity42 with other agencies about @entity92 may well have derailed the 9/11 plot			1
and it is merely an untestable hypothesis that if the @entity7 bulk phone collection program had been in place at the time that it might have helped to find the soon - to - be - hijackers in @entity81			1
indeed , the overall problem for @entity5 counterterrorism officials is not that they do n't gather enough information from the bulk surveillance of @entity5 phone data but that they do n't sufficiently understand or widely share the information they already possess that is derived from conventional law enforcement and intelligence techniques			1
an unfortunate pattern of cases what was true of the two 9/11 hijackers living in @entity81 was also the unfortunate pattern we have seen in several other significant terrorism cases : -- @entity255 resident @entity254 was central to the planning of the 2008 terrorist attacks in @entity258 that killed 166 people			2
yet , following the 9/11 attacks , @entity5 authorities received plausible tips regarding @entity254 's associations with militant groups at least five times from his family members , friends and acquaintances			1
these multiple tips were never followed up in an effective fashion			0
-- maj. @entity271 , a military psychiatrist , killed 13 people at @entity273 , @entity274 , in 2009			0
yet intelligence agencies had intercepted multiple e-mails between @entity271 and @entity277 , a @entity5 - born cleric living in @entity207 who was notorious for his ties to militants			1
the e-mails included a discussion of the permissibility in @entity282 of killing @entity5 soldiers			2
counterterrorism investigators did n't follow up on these e-mails , believing they were somehow consistent with @entity271 's job as a military psychiatrist			0
-- @entity287 , a convert to @entity282 , fatally shot a soldier at a @entity290 , @entity291 , military recruiting office in 2009			0
shortly before the attack , @entity292 had traveled to @entity207			0
as a result , @entity292 was under investigation by the @entity107 yet he was still able to buy the weapons he needed for his deadly attack when he was back in the @entity5			2
-- @entity299 @entity298 attempted to blow up @entity300 over @entity301 on christmas day 2009 with an " underwear bomb			0
" luckily , the bomb failed to explode			0
yet , a few weeks before the botched attack , @entity298 's father contacted the @entity306 in @entity299 with concerns that his son had become radicalized and might be planning something			0
this information was n't further investigated			0
@entity298 had been recruited by @entity36 's branch in @entity207 for the mission			0
the @entity314 's review of the underwear bomb plot concluded that there was sufficient information known to the @entity5 government to determine that @entity298 was likely working for @entity36 in @entity207 and that the group was looking to expand its attacks beyond @entity207			1
yet @entity298 was allowed to board a plane bound for the @entity5 without any question			2
all of these serious terrorism cases argue not for the gathering of ever vaster troves of information but simply for a better understanding of the information the government has already collected and that are derived from conventional law enforcement and intelligence methods .			2

@entity7 and defenders say its bulk surveillance could prevent another 9/11
@entity336 : true story of 9/11 was n't a failure to have enough intelligence data
he says the @entity44 administration failed to connect the dots , but they were *plentiful*
@entity345 : @entity5 officials often fail to properly interpret or share the data the government collects
