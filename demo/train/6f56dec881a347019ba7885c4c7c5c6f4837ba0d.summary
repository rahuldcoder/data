-- " that 's the second unmanly thing you 've done today , " is the punch line of the most frequently played @entity2 ad during @entity4 games			1

in all these shows , men have become the butt of the jokes			1
from weakness to irresponsibility to immaturity , the modern idea of manhood is in doubt			1
a shift in cultural norms , a changing workforce and the rise of women have left many men in an identity crisis			1
it makes for good comedy , but bad families			0
although men remain at the top of the heap in terms of compensation and job status , particularly in fields like science , business , and politics , things are changing			1
this year there will be more women ceos of @entity70 companies than ever before			0

my first @entity7 column on this subject identified what i think are the common problems with some men today : deficiencies in work , marriage and faith			1
the overwhelming response i received , from men and women alike , worries me			1
many women told me the problems are much worse than i described			0
they explained to me how they have to lower their standards to find a man			0
young women , in particular , complained that men are dragging them down and holding them back			1
as one woman told me , if 60 is the new 40 for men , then 25 is the new 13			1
most feminists are not celebrating the decline of men and shouting it from the rooftops			1
certainly , the far - left feminist movement has sought to diminish the role of men , but a majority of women want able , competent men of their equal			1
strong men make stronger women ( and vice versa ) and stronger families , and women want that			1
many men today are n't sure what they want			1
in developed @entity117 countries , man has unprecedented freedom to chose , to a degree heretofore unknown , a life of his own wanting and design			0

yet with this increased opportunity comes increased confusion , and the response on the part of some men has not been encouraging			2
take the @entity136 movement , for instance			0

rather than look inward and rely on their own self - sufficiency , they look for a handout			0
a man 's livelihood once depended on his hands , back and brain			2
today , the government can do all that for him , if he lets it			0
the struggle between dependency and freedom has provoked many to ask the question : how does one be a man today ? boys become men through mimesis -- the @entity173 word for imitation			2

the forces of imitation can be either constructive or destructive , making it essential that boys imitate the right kind of men			2

through the instruction of my family and teachers i was exposed to other heroes and heroines , like @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , the rev. @entity215 and so on			0

it is our generation 's task to instruct and train our boys to be men			1
as @entity234 says , train a child in the way he should go , and when he is old he will not turn from it			2
