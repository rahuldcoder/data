@entity0 -- here are six words i thought i 'd never hear myself say : " i can relate to @entity4			1
" you might think that there would n't be much common ground between a 69 - year - old @entity8 and a 45 - year - old @entity11 - @entity10 columnist			0
apparently , our philosophies on raising kids without spoiling them with parental handouts are quite similar			1
this information comes courtesy of @entity4 's chatty ex-wife , @entity20			1
according to the @entity22 tabloid newspaper @entity21 , @entity20 said she has been pressuring @entity4 -- unsuccessfully , i might add -- to dip into his fortune ( estimated at about $ 300 million ) and buy houses for three of his kids who are in their 20s			1
yes , that 's right			2
not cars or clothes or jet skis			0
@entity20 is going for broke and asking @entity4 to purchase houses for the three children -- @entity37 , 29 , @entity38 , 27 , and @entity39 , 21			1
the daughters are models , and the son is a musician			0
the couple has a fourth child , @entity44 , 15 , but he still lives at home with his mom			0
the way that @entity20 sees it , @entity4 can easily afford the purchase			1
the multimillionaire reportedly has five homes of his own			0
so what 's the problem ? the problem , according to the tabloid newspaper , is that @entity4 , who is known to be " famously careful with his pennies , " is firmly opposed to these types of " parental housing subsidies			1
" according to the newspaper , the @entity4 thinks that his children have already enjoyed many advantages in life and that setting them up in their own homes will do more harm than good			1
those who know @entity4 well -- including his oldest daughter , @entity67 , who is the only child of his marriage to ex-wife @entity69 -- say that he strongly believes that children ought not think themselves entitled to their parents ' money and that they have to make their own way in life			1
@entity67 , who has her own jewelry store , told the newspaper : " i was never a trust - fund child			0
@entity77 's got a healthy attitude toward work			2
you have to look after yourself			0
@entity10 really need to hear that message			0
and not just our kids ; all of us should get an earful			2
at a time when runaway entitlement spending and a national debt of more than $ 16 trillion threaten the economic future of the @entity10 , the national motto has become " where 's mine ? " now more than ever , @entity10 need to understand that part of being a good parent is teaching their adult children to stand on their own two feet			1
as a parent of three young children , i can imagine that this is n't easy to do			1
my kids know that i 'm an easy mark			2
and i struggle daily with saying no -- or , in some cases , with making them do chores and save their allowances to buy things on their own			2
but i understand where @entity4 is coming from , and i applaud him			1
he 's on the right track , and a lot of other people are on the wrong one			0
@entity112 : never - before - seen photos somewhere , in the vast universe of parenting , we lost our way			0
we 've convinced ourselves that loving our kids also means supporting them more than we need to			0
caring for our children is one thing , but making them dependent on us well into adulthood is another			1
the former is the sign of a good parent ; the latter is a recipe for trouble			1
billionaire @entity130 refers to it as the " lottery of the womb " -- this sense that some people have that they are entitled to their parents ' money through inheritance or lavish gifts			0
in writing about parenting over the years , and talking about it with other parents , i 've become convinced that a lot of parents with young children worry more that they 're giving their kids too much rather than too little			1
the concern is that in trying to keep their kids from struggling , they 're making their lives too comfy			0
at the very least , most of us are probably giving our kids much more than what we were given by our parents when we were growing up			1
we need to ask : what harm is this doing ? these days , when you 're raising kids , materialism does n't merely knock on your door			0
ten - year - olds are asking for cell phones			0
when our kids want something and ask us for it , we might ask ourselves three questions : is it a good price ? can we afford it ? do they deserve it ? but those are the wrong questions			2
we need ask ourselves only one question : will buying my child this item teach him positive values or negative ones ? you see , it does n't matter how much money @entity4 has or what he can afford			2
that is not the issue			0
the issue is that he 's trying to teach his children some values , something that is n't always easy to do when you 're one of the megawealthy			2
like the saying goes , you want to leave your kids enough money so they can do something with their lives -- but not so much that they can do nothing			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			2

according to the @entity21 , @entity4 's ex-wife asked him to buy houses for their kids
@entity199 : @entity4 is right to be wary of such " parental housing subsidies "
he says being a good parent is teaching adult children to stand on their own two feet
@entity199 : if kids grow up to be dependent on their parents , then we have failed them
