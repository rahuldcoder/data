a week of demonstrations in @entity1			1
three people shot dead ; dozens wounded ; dozens more arrested and imprisoned			0
pro-regime thugs intimidate protesting high school and college students			0
the question is being asked : is @entity8 finally cracking in @entity1 ? @entity9 died of cancer nearly a year ago , and the question hanging over @entity1 is how long his strange regime can live after him			1
a country with a population smaller than @entity15 's has more murders than the @entity17			2
goods from toilet paper to sacramental wine have vanished from shops			0
a regime that calls itself " socialist " has massively enriched the former president 's family and friends			1
street lights dim at night because a country with some of the world 's largest energy reserves can not provide enough electricity			2
the @entity9 regime has held power with four principal tools , all but one of which is gone or going			1
the first tool of power was the late president 's own mesmerizing personality			2
@entity1 has a bitter national history , and nobody has ever better voiced the resentments and yearnings of its subordinated classes and castes than @entity9			1
in a nation whose elite historically looked @entity53 , @entity9 's face proclaimed his descent from indigenous people and african slaves			1
he joked , he raged , he bestowed favors on the barrios and made enemies of the traditional upper classes			0
by contrast , the outstanding personal quality of @entity9 's chosen successor , @entity63 , was his cringing deference to the leader who elevated him from a bus driver 's seat to the top jobs in government			1
@entity1 expels three @entity17 diplomatic officials the second @entity9 tool of power was the shrewd deployment of the nation 's oil wealth to buy support from favored constituencies			1
@entity78 , and you might get a free house stocked with appliances , a government job or at least a new playground			0
@entity9 held the price of gasoline to pennies per gallon and offered subsidized rice and beans in government - owned shops			1
meanwhile , he withdrew police protection from the wealthier neighborhoods that despised him , deploying criminal violence as a de facto tool of political repression			0
now , however , @entity1 is running out of cash to pay for these support - buying schemes			1
industries are shuttering because they can not obtain foreign currency to buy crucial parts			2
interest rates on @entity1 debt have jumped past 15 %			1
the economy , which managed 1 % growth in 2013 , is now shrinking as economic activity other than oil and gas production grinds to a stop			0
@entity9 's third tool of power was control of the media			1
independent television stations were eliminated			0
newsprint shortages and other pressures were manipulated to force the sale of independent print media to government supporters			0
but it 's difficult to cut populations off from information in the modern age , especially for a ramshackle , technically incompetent regime like @entity1 under @entity8			1
@entity1 is not @entity123 nor even @entity124			1
the people who understand how the @entity126 works overwhelmingly oppose the government			0
the fourth and last tool of power was outright repression			0
@entity9 himself always used this tool sparingly			2
he preferred economic reprisals against his opponents to violence			0
he drove them into exile rather than send them to camps			0
he politicized the army and police , but he hesitated to use them , perhaps because he did not in the end fully trust them			0
when i visited @entity1 in 2010 , everybody was talking about elite @entity147 paramilitary police units that @entity9 had supposedly borrowed from @entity148			1
but change is coming to @entity147 too , and if the units ever existed , they certainly have not been visible in the past 's weeks clashes			0
instead , @entity63 has relied on local thugs			2
perhaps the @entity156 example inspires @entity63 to hope that he can hang on if his forces just kill enough people			2
but @entity1 is located in a very different neighborhood , close not only to the @entity17 but also to democracies in @entity161 and @entity162 that take a dim view of murderous dictatorship			2
( @entity63 has said that the opposition is mounting a " developing coup " and has issued an arrest warrant on conspiracy and murder charges against an opposition leader ; the opposition leader 's party blames the government for the violence			1
) @entity9 had an instinctive awareness that he could go so far but not too far			2
@entity177 's successor shares that awareness of limits , those limits still exist -- and without crossing them , @entity9 's regime may have run out of the resources it needs to survive			1
as the @entity148 regime in @entity147 has demonstrated , a moribund authoritarian system can take a long time dying			0
but the @entity148 brothers were serious about hanging on to power			0
chavismo was serious about nothing .			0
