-- in my book , @entity2 , i make scores of predictions for this century , based on interviews with over 300 of the world 's top scientists , who are inventing the future in their labs			1
here are some top game - changing predictions that they make : fusion and space - based power because cheap oil will eventually run out and because burning fossil fuels drives global warming , new forms of energy are desperately needed			1
within a decade , solar / wind / renewable technologies will drop in price and be competitive with oil , due to the rising cost of fossil fuels			1
but by 2019 , fusion power becomes a major player			1
that is when the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) becomes operational in southern @entity29			2
costing over $ 10 billion dollars , it is a crash project designed from the start to generate more energy than it consumes			2
rather than burning uranium ( which creates vast amounts of nuclear waste and the danger of meltdowns ) fusion reactors cleanly burn hydrogen , which is found in sea water			1
fusion is the energy source which powers the sun , the stars , and the universe			1
a decade after that , commercial fusion power plants may proliferate around the world , thereby solving the energy crisis and global warming			1
clean , safe , and renewable , fusion power promises to energize our economy by mid century			1
space elevator @entity56 dreams of colonizing the universe have been stunted by a simple four - letter word : @entity60 - @entity59 it costs $ 10,000 per pound to just put you in near @entity64 orbit over the planet			2
that is your weight in solid gold			2
to put you on the @entity69 costs roughly $ 100,000 per pound			2
and to put you on @entity70 costs roughly $ 1,000,000 per pound , or your weight in diamonds			2
but late in the 21st century , a new game changer might be possible -- the space elevator , in which you simply push the " up " button and then the elevator climbs effortlessly into outer space , like @entity78			2
like a ball spinning on string , it does not fall to the @entity64 because of centrifugal force			2
here is where nanotechnology comes in			2
the strongest substance known to science , stronger than diamonds , is graphene , made of a single atomic layer of carbon atoms			2
it is strong enough to support a space elevator without breaking			2
( it is so strong you can balance an elephant on a pencil , which then rests on a layer of graphene , and the graphene sheet will not tear )			0
read more : car the size of a molecule at present , we can only produce tiny , millimeter - sized portions of this pure carbon , but in the future , if we can solve the technical question of creating miles of this substance , then this technology may eventually open up outer space , so that we become a true space - faring civilization			1
stop the aging process for millennia , kings and queens have sought the @entity118 without success			1
we still do n't have it , but biotechnology may eventually allow us to stop and maybe reverse the aging process			1
after centuries of confusion , we now know what aging is : the build - up of errors , at the molecular , genetic , and cellular level			1
but it is possible to create error - correcting mechanisms which might reverse this process			1
at present , for example , we can double the life span of most organisms , from yeast cells , to spiders and insects , rats and mice , rabbits , dogs and cats , and now primates			0
eventually , a combination of several therapies ( e.g. gene therapy , caloric restriction , telomerase , sirtuins , etc. ) may allow us to unlock the aging process			1
already , about 60 genes have been isolated where aging seems to be concentrated			1
in the future , when everyone has their personal genome on a disk , we will use computers to scan millions of genomes of young people , then the genomes of the elderly , and then simply subtract			1
in this way , we will isolate the genes involved in aging			1
( for example , we are 98.5 % genetically identical to a chimpanzee			0
but we live twice as long			0
so , among a handful of genes are the ones which have doubled our life span			0
) our grandchildren may have the option of reaching the age of 30 , and then stopping at that age for many decades to come			0
intelligent machines artificial intelligence has proven to be more difficult than scientists originally thought back in the 1950s , when it was predicted that we would have mechanical maids , butlers , and companions by 2000			1
at present , our most advanced robot has the intelligence of a cockroach , barely able to recognize and navigate among simple objects in a room			0
but in the coming decades , great progress will inevitably take place			0
our robots will eventually become as smart as a mouse , then a dog or a cat , and finally a monkey			1
the robotics industry may eventually become larger than the automobile industry today			1
read more : the future of warfare no one knows when a robot will approach human intelligence , but i suspect it will be late in the 21st century			1
will they be dangerous ? possibly			0
so i suggest we put a chip in their brain to shut them off if they have murderous thoughts			0
but once robots surpass us in intelligence , will we wind up in the evolutionary dust bin , surpassed by our own creations ? some suspect they might put us in zoos , and throw peanuts and make us dance behind bars			0
this may leave open one last option : merge with our creations			0
this may not sound as preposterous as it first appears			0
and there are perks involved with merging with our robotic creations , such as immortality and perfect , superhuman bodies			0
the replicator the @entity233 of nanotechnology is the replicator , a device which can create anything from almost nothing			0
in science fiction , it is a chamber where you put in the raw materials , and then ask for anything you want , whether it be dinner , a computer , or jewelry			0
the key to creating the replicator is the " nanobot , " a robot the size of a molecule which can cut and rearrange molecular bonds , turning junk into valuable commodities , atom for atom			0
at first , this seems impossible			0
but actually @entity257 has already created a nanobot			0
it is called a ribosome , and can cleanly cut and paste molecules together like a master welder			0
this allows nature to take hamburgers and @entity29 fries and then convert them into a baby in nine months			0
however , it may take a century to master the intricate art of reshaping matter from almost nothing			0
but when it happens , we will be able to take a rabbit out of a hat , literally , and change civilization in the process			1
hunger and poverty may be banished if everyone had a replicator			0
this could open up a @entity283 for humanity			0
