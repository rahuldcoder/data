@entity0 -- when @entity3 drives to @entity5 's @entity4 , about 10 minutes outside the airfield , he begins to notice a line of cars -- including @entity9 and @entity10 -- parked along the side of the highway			0
" why ? it 's because these people , who can spend a million dollars on a car , do n't want to spend $ 2 on parking at the garage , " said @entity3 , managing director at @entity13			0
for @entity22 leaders , the nation 's newfound wealth represents a bumpy road as they try to steer the economy on a new path			1

@entity34 warns of corruption as congress begins one of the great challenges the new leadership faces is to move the economy -- currently driven by exports and investment -- toward a more sustainable course led by domestic consumer spending			1
while domestic consumption is rising , it still makes up just over one - third of the @entity22 's total economy			1
@entity50 consumers , by comparison , power more than two - thirds of the @entity50 economy			0
much has been made of @entity22 's growing group of super rich which has spurred record sales for luxury goods makers such as @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			1
the nation has an estimated one million people with a net worth of $ 1 million or more , and that is expected to grow 2.5 times in the next three years , @entity3 said			2
but much of the hope of the rising domestic spending rests with @entity22 's growing middle class			1
there are an estimated 350 million people in @entity22 's middle class , which are households that earn between $ 6,000 and $ 15,000 , @entity3 said			1
a government think tank predicted last week that by 2020 there will be 600 million @entity22 earning middle - class incomes			1
" but they are not really middle class in the @entity50 sense			2
in the @entity50 , you 're born a blue collar worker , your parents were blue collar , your grandparents -- and you 're proud of that , you have that identity			0
and you like to shop at @entity85 on special occasions , " @entity3 said			0
" in @entity22 , you do n't have that -- that does n't really exist			0
everyone here says they 're going to be rich , " he added			0
@entity22 business : ' @entity93 is not coming back ' that growth represents eye - popping opportunities for foreign multinationals and domestic companies			1
@entity22 consumers prefer overseas brands for consumer electronics yet favor domestic companies for personal care or household items , according to a recent report by @entity105			2
and foreign companies that got into the market early -- such as @entity108 -- are now raking in record profits			1
but as outgoing president @entity34 noted last week , concerns remain			2
he set an ambitious target for 2020 to double per capita income in @entity22 from 2010 levels for both rural and urban dwellers to address the rising wealth disparity			1
@entity22 's per capita income was $ 4,423 in 2010 , according to the @entity117			2
" unbalanced , uncoordinated and unsustainable development remains a big problem , " @entity34 said in his speech at the party congress			0
" i think what 's more alarming or more worrisome is how big is it going to get ? will it continue to grow and drive economic growth not only in @entity22 but for the world ? or will it stagnate under a mountain of new debt -- debt from expensive housing to the cost of educating your kids to health care costs ? " said @entity127 , author of " as @entity128 , so goes the world : how @entity22 consumers are transforming everything			2
" " these are all things that the government is trying to address by reinstituting some semblance of a social safety net , so instead of saving 40 or 50 % of their disposable incomes , people can start to spend it , " adds @entity127 , who teaches at @entity140 of the @entity141			1

as @entity172 's @entity171 recently wrote , a new @entity22 @entity168 -- constructed of regulations and restrictions -- are making it harder for foreign companies to compete with domestic players in the @entity22 consumer market			1
" things that were easy are less easy , " @entity178 , president of the @entity0 - based auto consultancy @entity177 , told @entity172 , adding that carmakers " have to work harder to get what they want			0
free access is not part of the equation			0
" still , more cash is trickling down to @entity22 laborers			0
more than half of the country 's growth last year " has come from domestic consumption , and it 's really because the government is pushing for more money to go into the pocket of everyday @entity22 -- 21 of @entity22 's 31 provinces increased the minimum wage by 22 % , " @entity3 said			1
