it 's often said you can tell a lot about a man by the company he keeps			0
it 's an aphorism worth remembering on arguably the most hectic day in the football calendar as clubs rush to grab a deal on transfer deadline day			1
and according to one football scout , a young man 's friends can also tell you if he 's going to make it big in the beautiful game			0
@entity17 is a former player who now works for @entity20 club @entity18 , scouring the globe in the hope of finding a future star			1
profiling players , and seeing how they behave off the pitch , is key to understanding whether they are right for the @entity27 , insists @entity17 -- who played for 25 clubs during a rich and varied career			1
" i can go to @entity30 , i can go to @entity31 , i can find hundreds of top class players			0
but the question is , will they really work in @entity20 ? " the former goalkeeper told @entity1			2
a fan of big cats , @entity17 has some @entity39 - like qualities in his observation of footballers			2
whether they are in training , staying at a hotel , or even just socializing in a group , he watches them closely for signs of telltale behavior			0
" it sounds very basic , but if i see a player who walks around by himself with big earphones on , and ignores everything that is around him , then i am not sure that that 's the player i would like to have , " he explained			0
musical head gear is not the only thing that detective @entity17 checks up on , with players ' social lives being put under a magnifying glass too			1
" does he have bad friends ? is he going out on the weekend ? is he a really hard working professional ? these are all things you can find out , " he said			0
networking is @entity17 's modus operandi , allowing him to keep track of players across the globe without clocking too many air miles			1
whether players know it or not , people close to them might be reporting back to scouts like @entity17 , so it 's important players are on their best behavior -- and keep the right company			1
" there are guys who are basically looking at every woman in the team 's hotel is that really what you want ? it 's good to have a personal profile , it 's good to see their behavior outside the football field			0
" language can be another stumbling block for footballers hoping to make it big abroad , with @entity17 setting a pass mark of being able to speak " at least the basics			1
" the goal is for players to be able to gel with teammates both on and off the pitch -- if they ca n't then @entity17 will have no qualms about waving " auf wiedersehen " to them			1
he hopes that they will not just communicate with other players , " but also with the coaches , with the fans			0
the player needs to be liked by the fans to be 100 % happy			0
" in many ways , @entity18 epitomize the current transfer market within football			1
for a provincial club with a humble history -- in 1999 , their stadium held less than 1,700 fans -- @entity18 's status has been boosted by skilled players from abroad , recruited after some hefty investments from chief financial backer @entity118			1
one foreign import who has impressed @entity17 is @entity120 , a @entity121 national player who joined @entity18 in 2013 and has since become an essential pillar of the team			1
@entity124 has a similar story , originally from the @entity126 he was prolific with @entity127 in the @entity128 before joining @entity130 team @entity129 in 2013			0
@entity124 was the top goal scorer in the @entity130 during the calendar year 2014 and has recently made a $ 42.5 million move to @entity133			0
but not all players settle into foreign countries as easily as @entity124 and @entity120 seem to have done			0
as @entity17 argues , " many times players from these countries fail			2
not because they 're bad players -- they fail because they ca n't adjust			2
they ca n't adjust to the life , to the culture and to the surroundings			0
" failure is not an option for @entity18 , which would rather coach their domestic players to stardom than buy brilliance from abroad			1
tightening purse strings are another reason for the club to look for talent closer to home -- with some transfer fees skyrocketing during the january window			0
" the clubs who give players away , they know the prices are actually sometimes out of proportion , " @entity17 argues			2
the huge expense of some transfer fees means that clubs are under pressure to avoid any costly mistakes , leaving clubs like @entity18 to nurture local talent			2
" we are not that desperate anymore to bring in foreigners left , right , and center -- we 'd rather give youngsters a chance			0
" it 's a tactic that @entity18 -- along with many other @entity20 clubs -- have used to their advantage			1
" the number of players coming from the under 19 's into the premier league in @entity20 is higher than it ever was before			1
" the search is now on for top talent in football , but @entity17 wo n't be looking too far afield .			2

@entity17 's transfer deadline day do 's and don'ts
do n't wear earphones if you want to impress @entity17
he worries that not all players from abroad can adjust to playing in @entity20
@entity18 aims to develop its youngsters rather than take risks on expensive foreign transfers
