@entity0 -- one of the main stumbling blocks to talk with @entity3 has been the condition that @entity3 suspends its uranium enrichment			1
now , the @entity7 administration may take that option off the table , at least for now			1
this is from an @entity3 nuclear plant in the central province of @entity13 on april 9			2
the @entity14 and its @entity16 allies , which have just invited @entity3 to a fresh round of nuclear talks , are coming to the realization that if @entity3 's nuclear program is n't quite at the @entity21 , it will be soon			1
with 5,500 centrifuges , roughly enough for about two weapons worth of uranium a year , @entity3 is n't going to just shut down its enrichment facility as a goodwill gesture			0
for years , @entity3 has been willing to endure sanctions and economic isolation			0
what it has n't been willing to do is suspend enrichment			0
@entity3 maintains enriching uranium for nuclear energy is its right			2
now the @entity34 seems to have come around to @entity3 's way of thinking			1
last week during a speech on proliferation in @entity38 , @entity39 , president @entity7 admitted as much when he said , " we will support @entity3 's right to peaceful nuclear energy with rigorous inspections			1
" the @entity44 , the @entity46 nuclear watchdog , has long argued to allow @entity3 to maintain a small face - saving nuclear enrichment program under the guise of " research and development			2
" allowing such a program under the @entity53 , at least while negotiations continue , would involve strict @entity44 inspections -- something which may give the international community the kind of insight into @entity3 's nuclear program which it has long sought			1
it would also give @entity3 the cover to come back to the table without claiming it never gave in to the @entity34			0
rather , @entity63 can boast the international community came around to its point of view			0
preventing @entity3 enrichment may be an ultimate pipe dream , but officials hope the right package of incentives , coupled with the threat of tougher sanctions , which could cripple its stumbling economy , could deter @entity63 from developing a nuclear bomb			0
if adopted , the new strategy will undoubtedly be condemned by @entity76 , which has warned the @entity14 that it has until the end of the year to put an end to @entity3 's uranium production before it takes matters into its own hands			1
however , moving beyond the issue of enrichment helps @entity7 inch closer toward engagement with @entity3 , something he promised during the campaign and has begun to undertake with small , albeit significant , steps , most noticeably his @entity88 's message to the @entity3 people			1
those who watch @entity3 closely say @entity7 's outreach is being warmly received in the region			2
while the response from spiritual leader @entity95 and president @entity96 seems vague at first glance , experts argue the regime is being quite conciliatory , even flirting with the @entity14 overtures and opening the door for talks			0
now the administration is taking another leap , inviting @entity3 to several meetings on @entity105 as a way to engage on issues of mutual interest			0
the @entity14 is also seriously considering allowing @entity14 diplomats around the world to interact with their @entity3 counterparts and setting up a @entity14 interests section in @entity3			2
officials say not to expect any dramatic breakthroughs before the @entity3 head to the polls to elect a new president in june			0
but @entity7 's conservative critics , including several @entity119 lawmakers , worry @entity7 is making it too easy for @entity3 to come back to the table and is giving credibility to @entity3 's defiant @entity96 in his bid for re-election			1
the goal of stopping @entity3 from building a nuclear weapon remains , but the tactics are shifting and the rules of the game have changed			0
@entity7 and his advisers are betting that by finally giving @entity3 what it thinks it wants , the @entity14 and its allies will get what they need -- a way to bring @entity3 to the table and start meaningful negotiations , which have eluded them for the past four years .			1
