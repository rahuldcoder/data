@entity0 -- three years ago i began research on a book dedicated to the national pastimes : shopping and buying			2
the plan was to devote the first half of the story to what i called the " sell side " : the retailers , marketers and consumer researchers who have their sights trained on us			1
the second half would be about us , the " buy side			1
" i would explore all that attracts us -- bees to nectar -- to specific stores and products , why some of us are cheapskates and others have holes in our pockets			2
then , a not - so - funny thing happened			2
between the time i started my reporting and the time i handed in my finished manuscript , both the sell and the buy sides had cratered			1
the government tried feverishly to glue broken banks back together			2
unemployment went up and up and up			0
the result : consumer spending -- as in that which drives 70 percent of the @entity48 economy -- was running on fumes			1
department store sales sank by double - digits			0
" the golden age of spending for the @entity48 consumer has ended and a new age of thrift likely has begun , " said a @entity53 analyst			1
" sixty percent off is the new black , " quipped a magazine fashion writer			0
gone , seemingly overnight , were the throngs of buyers from @entity63 and @entity64 who had been dragging their wheelies down @entity67 in @entity0 , loading up on shoes and handbags and leaving us @entity48 shoppers feeling , even then , like poor country cousins			1
@entity73 spread that we were now living in " the @entity75 moment , " which was likely to be rather drawn out			0
our longstanding fetish for bigger , faster , flashier , pricier was no more			0
. with the most hyped shopping day on the calendar -- @entity80 ! -- upon us , we all might take a deep breath and focus , not just on where to find the best door - busters , but on more important questions : what is going on out there ? in the buying and selling universe , are we witnessing a permanent change in values ? have we all turned forever frugal ? the fact is , nobody 's quite sure right now			1
over the past several months , there have been small signs of recovery			0
consumer confidence surveys offer a glimmer of hope			1
on the " sell side " retailers are viewing the holiday selling season with slightly more optimism than when they put in their holiday purchase orders six months ago			0
and it seems reasonable to hope that we 've at least touched bottom and that the consumer escalator is on the way up again , however fitfully			1
but on the buy side -- our side -- things have changed dramatically , and in some ways for the better			1
we 're shopping more with our heads , not just our hearts ; we 're thinking about the things we buy			2
a woman in @entity117 -- affluent , accomplished , largely unscathed by the financial collapse -- told me that when she now looks back on the expensive shoes and clothes she bought routinely just a few years ago , she " just ca n't believe what i was doing			0
" the @entity125 is now a daily , indispensable tool we use to search for better prices and seek counsel from others with firsthand knowledge of brands and stores we might be considering			0
the result : up and down the socioeconomic ladder we 're shopping more prudently			0
we 're paying down credit card balances and placing greater value not just on the new and novel , the cool and the trendy , but also on value itself			2
does it work ? is the price fair ? will it last ? and yes , we 're also splurging now and then -- on impulse purchases that can make a day all the more sweet : a new hairstyle , a brightly colored this - or - that for spring , an electronic gadget that performs amazing tricks , some useful , some just diverting			0
there are those who would tell us that purchases like this -- " unnecessary ! " " juvenile ! " etc. -- are signs of character weakness , that we are routinely " conned " into buying useless things by manipulative @entity154 , but i think it 's more complicated			2
because if there 's one thing i learned after three years of watching folks shop and buy -- in good times , then bad -- it is n't that we buy that 's been our problem , it 's how we bought that was the issue : recklessly , and with little more than a piece of plastic or phantom home equity			1
this is now , and a little self - reward -- a from - me - to - me purchase here , an i - love - you purchase there -- are hardly crimes in my book			0
assuming , of course , they do n't bring down the house -- this holiday season and beyond			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182			1

@entity182 says a down economy has turned @entity48 spenders into *scrimpers*
it 's early to tell whether consumer habits have shifted permanently , he says
@entity182 : consumers are placing a new importance on value when they buy
