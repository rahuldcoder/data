@entity0 woke up on tuesday to horrific images of slain @entity3 worshipers , and scores injured in a terror attack on a synagogue			1
the assault which took place in the western @entity0 neighborhood of @entity10 , shocked @entity11 to the core , as well as many others around the world			1
this is not surprising considering both the brutality of the attack and the fact it was carried out in a holy place , where innocent religious people were worshiping			1
the two assailants , cousins from the @entity0 neighborhood of @entity23 , were shot dead by the @entity11 security forces			1
the incident in addition to the ongoing violence since the beginning of summer , left the city of @entity0 more divided than for a long time			1
the attack this week should have also sent a clear message to both leaderships that if they will not take measures to calm the situation down , further escalation and worse violence is around the corner			1
regrettably , the @entity40 praised the attack in @entity0 and the @entity11 prime minister @entity42 described the situation as the " @entity44			1
" he also accused the @entity47 president @entity46 of involvement despite the latter 's condemnation of the killing			0
both sides are employing inflammable language , although it is hard to blame the @entity47 president for feeling angry considering @entity11 behavior since the collapse of the peace process in april			1
to make things worse , it emerged in recent days that @entity11 has also decided to return to a policy of demolishing houses of terrorists ' families , even if they were killed during the attack			1
the @entity11 security establishment argues that this form of punishment serves as a deterrence for any other would - be assailants			1
regardless of the fate they face , their families are going to pay a heavy price and will be left homeless			0
in a society where three generations of one family might live under the same roof , one act harms quite a few people , from babies to the elderly			0
to prove the seriousness of their intentions , the @entity11 security forces already demolished a home on wednesday			2
the home in @entity88 was that of the @entity47 who drove his car into a crowd last month , killing two people			0
he was killed in the attack			2
the @entity94 also moved to demolish the houses of the two who carried out the killing at the synagogue in @entity0			1
ironically the policy of demolishing houses as a form of deterrence was abandoned back in 2005 at the request of the @entity11 army			2
a report produced , following an investigation by the @entity11 security establishment , found this action counter-productive			2
there is actually evidence that house demolition led to a rise in the number of attacks			0
@entity116 demolition of @entity47 militants ' houses is a form of collective punishment and an act of revenge , concealed behind a claim of deterrence			0
a similar " standard " was never applied to a @entity3 terrorist			0
for instance when a @entity3 settler , @entity127 , slayed 29 @entity130 worshipers in the @entity131 , no one suggested to demolish his home as a deterrence			0
according to the @entity11 human rights organization @entity138 , in the height of the @entity137 , between 2001 - 2005 , 664 @entity47 homes were demolished in the occupied @entity47 territories as an apparent deterrence			1
there is no evidence that the misery inflicted on thousands of innocent @entity47 enhanced @entity11 security			2
it is worth remembering that the demolition of @entity47 houses in the @entity148 also takes place for the purpose of expanding settlements , something which aggravates an already hostile population			0
arbitrary house demolitions represent not only a bad policy , but are also illegal and immoral			2
this is a clear violation of international law , more specifically the @entity156 , clearly prohibits forcing individuals and groups out of their homes within an occupied territory			2
any demolition of houses when there are no overwhelming military reasons is regarded as a grave breach of the @entity156 and could potentially lead to a war crime charge			0
and there is also , of course , a moral aspect			0
as deplorable as some of the acts committed by a few individuals , their punishment should not extend beyond their death or what the court decides			0
their families , as a result , suffered a loss too , for no fault of their own			0
to condemn them to destitution for an act that they did not commit is a moral travesty			0
the decision by the @entity11 to resume @entity47 house demolition following an attack on @entity3 in @entity11 is not a security decision but a political one , aimed to satisfy an angry public and extreme right - wing members of the current coalition			1
the @entity11 coalition depends on satisfying their demands			1
however , the lack of credibility of the deterrence argument , combined with the immorality and illegality of house demolitions should serve as an overwhelming reason not to resume this abysmal practice .			0

two *palestinians* carried out a deadly attack on a @entity0 synagogue this week
@entity11 later *announced* the homes of the attackers **--** shot dead **--** would be destroyed
@entity215 says such demolitions are immoral not proven to be *effective*
he says the decision is aimed at satisfying an angry public and extreme right - wing *lawmakers*
