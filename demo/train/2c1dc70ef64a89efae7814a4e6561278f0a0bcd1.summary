@entity0 , @entity1 -- one look at the landscape and you know why people come here -- running white water , along a portion of the @entity9			1
this is @entity0 , @entity1			1
it was the residents ' own best - kept secret until the world discovered it by way of a 1972 movie			1
the movie , " deliverance , " made tourist dollars flow into the area , but there was one memorable , horrifying male rape scene that lasted a little more than four minutes , but has lasted 40 years inside the hearts and minds of the people who live here			1
locals say the film painted the county 's residents as deviant , uneducated mountain folk			1
" we were portrayed as ignorant , backward , scary , deviant , redneck hillbillies , " said @entity31			1
" that stuck with us through all these years and in fact that was probably furthest from the truth			0
these people up here are a very caring , lovely people			2
" this weekend , the film 's 40th anniversary will be celebrated at the @entity42			2
a re-release of the iconic film on @entity45 by @entity46 will play at the local drive - in on saturday			1
the film tells the story of four big - city guys who take a drive up to northern @entity1 to canoe the white water of the @entity53 that separates @entity1 from @entity54			1
it 's remembered for the dueling banjo scene at the beginning of the film , where one man , played by @entity60 , plays a duet with a local teen , who is portrayed as inbred and mentally challenged			2
" dueling banjos , of course , was iconic , but then there 's the rape scene , too , " @entity60 said			0
" and for a lot of people it became a tough pill to swallow			2
" some people , i think they missed the artistic essence of it ( the film ) , the value of it			1
" but it 's the rape scene that seems to dominate any conversation about the film			2
" you were in the middle of the @entity82 , the biggest thing we had gong back then is we had square dancing at the @entity86 , " said @entity31 , the county commissioner			2
but many people , like @entity88 , say the local folks should put this behind them			2
the 40th anniversary means a lot to him			0
he 's 56 now , but 40 years ago , he was a student who was asked to play the " @entity97 boy " after the film 's producers found him on a visit to his high school			2
" i do n't think it should bother them			0
i think they just need to start realizing that it 's just a movie			0
it 's not like it 's real , " said @entity88 , who still lives in @entity0			1
but despite any negative stereotypes , the @entity106 and @entity107 says more than a quarter - million people flock to the area each year to shoot the same rapids they saw come to life on the big screen			1
the south : not all bubbas and banjos " it essentially started the white - water rafting industry in the @entity121 , " said @entity117 , who owns @entity118 , a rafting company			0
county officials say tourism brings in $ 42 million a year in revenue , which makes for a huge surplus for a county whose operating budget is about $ 17 million			1
these days , the county has an 80 % high school graduation rate , and its average home price is more than $ 300,000			0
" it 's allowed us to do things with our education system , with all these different services that we offer , we could not have offered , " @entity31 said			0
the area has become a playground for high - end homeowners with lakefront property in the multimillion - dollar range on places like @entity142 , which has 62 miles of shoreline			0
" once people come to @entity0 , they do n't want to leave , " said @entity144 , a real estate agent			1
" this is a lifestyle that you have here			0
it 's a way of life			0
' deliverance ' depicts a backwoods , inbred kind of community			0
" indeed , downtown shops and art galleries convey an image far from anything portrayed in the 1972 film			1
@entity163 's @entity162 in @entity164 shows off a wide range of contemporary folk artists , many self - taught			0
she 's been open for 28 years			0
" i became interested in contemporary folk art because of the things i 'd seen up here , " she said			0
" when people build houses and they come here , they need art on their walls			0
" most believe " deliverance " got it all started			0
but despite this prosperity , the 40 - year pain has managed to hang on , because so many people saw a fictional film			1
" there are lots of people in @entity0 that would be just as happy if they never heard the word , ' deliverance ' again , " @entity31 said .			1

the 1972 movie " deliverance " was shot in @entity0 , @entity1
the film *spurred* hard - to - shake stereotypes of " ignorant " and " deviant " mountain *dwellers*
" deliverance " also generated huge tourism dollars for the *northwest* @entity1 county
