@entity0 -- a top @entity4 @entity3 donor has had enough of sen. @entity6 's campaign focus on women 's reproductive rights			1
as @entity6 ( @entity9 ) delivered a line on the issue in his stump speech sunday during the final hours of a tight campaign against @entity15 challenger @entity14 , a heckler interrupted by shouting : " that 's not the only thing you stand for ! @entity19 ! " an account of the exchange was detailed by @entity22			1
according to the newspaper , @entity6 responded : " i 'm sorry ? " and then the man shouted again : " that 's not the only thing you stand for ! " the @entity22 identified the heckler as @entity28 , who became a millionaire on @entity30 and for years has been a hefty donor to @entity4 @entity3			1
he 's given at least $ 9,800 to @entity3 this year alone			2
he 's far from the first person to criticize @entity6 's campaign for its focus on the issue -- largely targeting @entity14 's previous support ( he reversed his stance this year ) for a " personhood " measure that would have had the effect of outlawing abortion			1
the issue could help @entity6 turn out votes among women , a key @entity3 constituency , who live in @entity47 's suburbs			1
they could be key in a neck - and - neck race : a @entity51 poll released monday showed @entity14 with a 45 % to 43 % lead over @entity6			0
but the state 's largest newspaper , the @entity53 , called @entity6 's campaign " obnoxious " in an editorial endorsing @entity14 in the @entity58 race			2
" rather than run on his record , @entity6 's campaign has devoted a shocking amount of energy and money trying to convince voters that @entity14 seeks to outlaw birth control despite the congressman 's call for over-the - counter sales of contraceptives , " the newspaper editorialized			2
" @entity6 is trying to frighten voters rather than inspire them with a hopeful vision			0
his obnoxious one - issue campaign is an insult to those he seeks to convince			0
" @entity6 's campaign argued the idea that the campaign has focused solely on women 's reproductive rights is a " misunderstanding			1
" @entity6 spokesman @entity81 said the campaign has aired tv ads on immigration reform , flood recovery , veterans ' affairs , the @entity88 and more			0
he said on monday , @entity6 was at a press conference with several other top @entity4 @entity3 officials on immigration reform			2
" this campaign has focused on a wide range of issues			0
those who imply otherwise are simply wrong , " he said			0
still , @entity81 defended the campaign 's efforts to highlight women 's reproductive rights , calling it an area of " fundamental difference " between @entity6 and @entity14			1
" these are not simply social issues , as many people talk about , " he said			0
" they are fundamental issues of freedom that affect every single aspect of not just a woman 's but a family 's lives , be it economic , professional and personal			0

@entity3 sen. @entity6 has focused much of his campaign in @entity4 on reproductive rights
a heckler shouted at a sunday rally : " that 's not the only thing you stand for ! @entity19 ! "
it 's just the latest blow @entity6 has suffered for his intense focus on the issue
