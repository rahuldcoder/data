-- @entity1 is living in fear in @entity3			2
she is a mother afraid for her son			0
" we are all having sleepless nights , " @entity5 says			0
@entity8 -- one of the @entity3 students attacked in @entity10			1
her son is n't in a war zone or even a country known to be dangerous			0
he is a student in @entity10 , @entity14			0
" three years back when we sent him , " she says , " it was one of the safest places for the children to go			0
" the @entity14 government says it is still safe but a spate of vicious attacks on @entity3 students in recent weeks has parents like @entity5 and hundreds of students shaken and angry			1
from @entity10 to @entity26 to @entity27 @entity3 students say they are targets of racially motivated attacks			1
at least 10 @entity3 students have been attacked over the past month , the most severe case left an @entity3 student in a coma , another student was stabbed in the stomach , and a third left with a nasty black eye			1
so far more than a dozen arrests have been made			0
@entity14 authorities say they do n't believe the attacks and robberies are racially motivated but instead crimes of opportunity against soft targets : students who typically travel alone at night on public transportation			1
but hundreds of @entity3 students see it differently			1
they have reacted with protests in at least three @entity14 cities			0
police say at one point @entity3 students decided to take the law into their own hands and retaliate which has been condemned in both @entity3 and @entity14			1
the situation has gotten so much attention @entity14 prime minister @entity58 has made several statements on the matter , insisting the attacks are isolated incidents			2
in an interview on @entity14 radio he said : " every city has violence , let 's put this into perspective , and @entity14 i 'm advised on the statistics is one of the safest countries in the world for international students			2
" in @entity3 though the perception of a safe @entity14 has been shattered partly due to the widespread publicity of the recent cases			1
the story has been front page news for days while local television media has been going with breaking news every time it receives a report of an @entity3 student attacked anywhere in @entity14			1
political tension has even bubbled up between @entity3 and @entity14 with @entity3 's prime minister @entity87 addressing the attacks and asking @entity14 does something to safeguard @entity3 's young people			1
@entity14 has responded with a 10 - point action plan to help safeguard students			2
a helpline has also been set up			0
as for @entity1 , she says her son has lived in @entity14 for three years and never experienced violence ; in fact she says he did n't even know about the attacks in @entity10 where he lives until she called him to warn him			2
but @entity5 has been watching the news in @entity3 and seeing a totally different picture of @entity14			2
" it 's a lovely beautiful peaceful country , " @entity5 says , " but now what you see on tv and what you hear , that 's a total contrast to what we know of @entity14			0
" the @entity5 family has responded by refusing to let the youngest son study in @entity14 and keeping their eldest son from enrolling in a master 's program at his university			0
if that kind of sentiment spreads , it could have serious consequences for @entity14 's $ 12.6 billion - a - year education export industry			0
more than 80,000 students from @entity3 study in @entity14			1
" any parent will tell you , " @entity5 says , " they are not going to send a child for the best education in the world at the cost of his life			0
