@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 does n't need an alarm clock			1
every morning , the sounds of 40 children wake her up in the two - story home she shares with them			2
as she helps the children dress for school , @entity3 might appear to be a housemother of sorts			1
but the real story is more complicated			0
all of these children once lived in @entity1 's prisons			1
this 28 - year - old woman has saved every one of them from a life behind bars			0
@entity1 is one of the poorest countries in the world -- according to @entity25 , 55 % of the population lives below the international poverty line -- so it lacks the social safety net that exists in most @entity30 nations			1
space is extremely limited in the few children 's homes affiliated with the government			1
so when no local guardian is available , an arrested parent often must choose between bringing their children to jail with them or letting them live on the streets			1
@entity1 's @entity42 estimates 80 children live in the nation 's prisons			1
" it 's not fair for ( these ) children to live in the prison because they have n't done anything wrong , " said @entity3 , who started a nongovernmental organization to help			1
" my mission is to make sure no child grows up behind prison walls			2
" @entity3 is one of several in @entity1 who have started groups to get children out of prison			1
since 2005 , she has assisted more than 100 children of incarcerated parents			1
she runs a day care program for children under 6 and a residential home where mostly older children receive education , food , medical care and a chance to live a more normal life			1
" i had a very fortunate life , with a good education , " @entity3 said			1
" i should give it to somebody else			0
" @entity3 was just 21 when she discovered her calling , she said			1
while her family ran a successful business , she was studying social work in college			0
as part of her studies , she visited a women 's prison and was appalled by the dire conditions			2
she also was shocked to discover children living behind bars			2
one baby girl grabbed @entity3 's shawl and gave her a big smile			1
" i felt she was calling me , " @entity3 said			1
" i went back home and told my parents about it			2
they told me it was a normal thing and that in a couple of days i 'd forget it			0
but i could n't forget			0
" @entity3 decided to start a day care to get incarcerated children out from behind the prison walls			1
while her parents were against the idea at first -- she had no job or way to sustain it financially -- eventually they helped support her			2
but prison officials , government workers and even some of the imprisoned mothers she approached doubted that someone her age could handle such a project			2
" when i started , nobody believed in me , " @entity3 said			1
" people thought i was crazy			0
" but @entity3 was undaunted			1
she got friends to donate money , and she rented a building in @entity0 to house her new organization , the @entity116			2
she furnished it largely by convincing her parents that they needed a new refrigerator or kitchen table ; when her parents ' replacement would arrive , she 'd whisk the old one to her center			2
just two months after she first visited the prison , @entity3 began to care for five children			1
she picked them up at the prison every weekday morning , brought them to her center and then returned them in the afternoon			2
@entity3 's program was the first of its kind in @entity0 ; when she started , some of the children in her care had never been outside a prison			1
two years later , @entity3 established the @entity137 , a children 's home where she herself has lived for the past five years			1
while she now has a few staff members who help her , @entity3 is still very hands on			2
" we do cooking , washing , shopping , " she said			0
" it 's amazing , i never get tired			0
( the children ) give me the energy			0
... the smiles of my children keep me motivated			0
" coordinating all of this is no easy task			0
but at the @entity137 , the older kids help care for the younger ones and everyone pitches in with household chores			0
the atmosphere feels like an extremely large family , a feeling that 's fostered by @entity3 , who smothers the children with love			1
the children reciprocate by calling her " @entity166 , " which means " @entity168			0
" " i do n't ever get a day off , but if i [ did n't ] have the children around me , it would be hard , " she said			2
" when i 'm with them , i 'm happy			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity176 all the children are at the @entity137 with the consent of the imprisoned parent			1
when @entity3 hears about an imprisoned child , she 'll visit the prison -- even in remote areas of the country -- and tell the parent what she can provide			1
if the parent agrees , @entity3 brings the child back			2
she is still eager , however , for the children to maintain relationships with their parents			2
during school holidays , she sends the younger children to the prisons to visit , and she brings them food , clothing and fresh water during their stay			0
ultimately , @entity3 wants the families to reunite outside prison , and 60 of her children have been able to do just that			1
parents like @entity203 are grateful for @entity3 's efforts			1
@entity203 has spent the last seven years in a women 's prison in @entity0			1
when she was convicted on drug charges , she had no other options for child care , so she brought her two daughters to jail with her			0
when she heard about @entity3 's program , she decided to let them go live with her			1
" if @entity3 was n't around , ( they ) could have never gotten an education ... ( they ) would have probably had to live on the streets , " she said			1
" i feel she treats ( them ) the way i would			0
" @entity203 's oldest daughter , @entity219 , said she ca n't imagine life without @entity3			2
" my life would have been dark without her , " said @entity219 , 14			0
" i would 've probably always had a sad life			0
but now i wo n't , because of @entity3			2
" in 2009 , @entity3 started a program to teach the parents how to make handicrafts , which she sells to raise money for the children 's care			1
both mothers and fathers participate			0
it not only gives them skills that might help them support themselves when they 're released , but it also helps them feel connected to their children			0
" often , they think that they 're useless because they 're in prison , " @entity3 said			1
" i want to make them feel that they are contributing back to us			0
" making ends meet is always a struggle , though			0
the children help by making greeting cards that @entity3 sells as part of her handicraft business			1
in the past , she has sold her own jewelry and possessions to keep the center going			0
her biggest concern is trying to find ways to do more to give the children a better future			0
she recently set up a bank account to save for their higher educations , and one day she hopes to buy or build a house so they 'll always have a place to call home			0
their happiness is always foremost in her thoughts			0
" this is what i want to do with my life , " she said			0
" it makes me feel ( good ) when i see that they are happy , but it makes me want to work harder			0
... i want to fulfill all their dreams			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity116 website at @entity280 and see how to help			0
@entity2 's @entity281 contributed to this report .			0

in @entity1 , many children have little choice but to live in prison with their incarcerated parents
fortunately , more and more are finding special homes like the one run by @entity3
@entity292 also operates a day care in @entity0 for children under 6 years old
