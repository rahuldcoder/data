@entity57 , @entity56 's grandmother , said relatives are mystified and want answers			2

police say there was no such operation			0
@entity1 mayor @entity87 said authorities are treating the incident as a missing - person case because so far , there 's no evidence the young people were kidnapped			1

what we have is a missing persons report and the knowledge that they 're missing			0
we have to do something to find them , " @entity87 said			0
@entity102 , the ' murder capital ' of the world @entity1 district attorney @entity105 said security cameras at the bar were not working , but authorities are relying on city cameras in the neighborhood			1
so far , he said , an analysis of video from the cameras does not show any violence in or around the bar where the kidnapping supposedly took place			0
authorities searched the bar and found illegal drugs but no signs of forced entry or anything that would indicate the young people had been kidnapped , @entity105 said			1
