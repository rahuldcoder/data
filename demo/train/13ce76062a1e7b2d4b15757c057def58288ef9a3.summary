-- @entity1 wiped away my house			1
in one fell swoop i lost nearly everything that was meaningful to me			1
in the aftermath of the storm , one year later many people in my neighborhood and i are still in limbo			2
here 's what happened : my music group @entity12 and i were set to play on a ship cruise , with 3,000 passengers aboard celebrating the music of the 1950s and ' 60s			2
we were going to board in @entity17 on october 31			2
before we left , the organizers called and urged us to leave a few days early to meet the boat in @entity17 , concerned about a storm that was heading up the @entity21			2
they wanted to make sure we avoided any problems that would prevent us from getting there on time			2
they were putting us up in a hotel on the island while we waited for the boat			0
i packed my bag , my @entity12 hat , put food in the garage for my feral cat , called a cab and locked the back door , a familiar ritual for many years			1
my house on the beach in @entity38 , @entity39 , was built in 1916 , 22 years before the first of two bridges were built to connect the @entity38 to @entity42 on one end and @entity44 on the other			1
the house had survived many storms since 1916 and in the 40 years i lived in it			1
i felt so connected to my home -- it was my friend , my oasis and my place of healing after hard days on the road			1
after storms , there never was much damage , not much to fix and never any water damage in the basement , which contained , among many memorable items , my music studio			1
@entity62 : photographer revisits @entity1 's path in this studio were thousands of 45 - rpm singles , hundreds of albums , microphones , amplifiers , a drum kit , my upright piano ( from the @entity72 ) 24 track tapes from " @entity74 , " " @entity75 " and " @entity76 , " demos , tapes and a vintage guitar collection collected over 50 years of playing music			1
in my hotel room , the @entity81 was tracking @entity1			1
it was pretty alarming , so i called a friend who lived on the next block in @entity38			1
he was in the front of his house and told me that the water was rushing up the street from the ocean			1
he saw books and records from my house floating by			1
i lay awake most of the night , thinking of the worst ... but never really believing it could be true			0
i reached his cell phone early the next morning and he was walking up the block toward my house on the beach			1
i said , " @entity102 , are you there ? what 's up ? " no response			0
again i repeated , " what 's up ? " silence			0
" are you there ? " finally he said , " it 's gone , it 's gone ... your house , your house -- it 's gone			1
" when the cruise ended , four days later , my friend @entity115 picked me up at the airport			1
he had saved my car by moving it out of my garage to higher ground			0
the trip back from the airport was a journey into a world of disbelief			0
the bridges to @entity38 were closed and in the small towns we drove through along the peninsula , the devastation was mind - boggling -- sand and debris everywhere , trees uprooted , houses destroyed , entire blocks burnt to the ground			0
when we finally reached my street , i saw something i will never forget : i did n't have a house anymore			1
no home , just a pile of rubble -- no driveway , no landscaping , no foundation			2
it looked like it had been bombed			0
at that moment reality ceased to exist			0
the mundane facts of everyday life hit me			0
most immediately , where would i sleep ? where are my clothes ? my bed ? my socks , my eyeglasses , family treasures , boyhood photographs -- the pictures my grandchildren would never see of their great - grandfather and great - grandmother ? major decisions had to be made , and with much difficulty , i tried to gather my thoughts			0
i had to find a place to stay			0
thank @entity169 my car was safe so i could get around			0
for three months i lived in a hotel room in @entity172 -- dealing with @entity173 , having seemingly constant , endless conversations with many different people			2
finally , @entity173 reimbursed me for the hotel room			0
the only clothes i had were in my suitcase , so i had to buy all the clothing essential for living in winter , and additional suits for my show			2
because so many businesses were wiped out , dealing with work and life details became all - day fiascoes			0
at least i had the money to pay for all this -- people who did n't have were in deep trouble			0
living in the hotel room became a strain , and i felt very hopeless			2
it became important to return to my roots , to the place i was connected to deeply for 40 years			1
but searching for and finding a rental property in @entity38 was almost impossible ; most of the houses were in bad disrepair and many had significant mold problems			0
luckily , i finally found one that was mold free but empty , so i rented beds , tvs , kitchen supplies , sofas , chairs -- the works -- to turn this rental into a home			1
today , i 'm still living in the rental house , trying to tie up all the loose ends left in the aftermath of the devastating storm -- problems like what to do with the remains of my old property and dealing with insurance companies and all the red tape that comes with that			1
a busy work schedule helps in returning to sense of normalcy			0
and one night , fans surprised me with a presentation of many old recordings and memorabilia			2
many of us in @entity38 are still waiting to see what the new flood and homeowner 's insurance rates and building codes will be , biding our time before making any future plans			2
but my spirit is intact and life must go on			0
it 's funny how in life obstacles are put in front of us -- but they are there for a reason			0
we learn to climb over them , no matter how difficult , to eventually get to the other side			0
