@entity0 came out swinging monday against allegations that prince @entity3 had sex with an underage girl			1
prominent @entity7 attorney @entity6 , facing a similar accusation , did the same in a @entity1 interview			1
" it is emphatically denied that the @entity3 had any form of sexual contact or relationship with @entity15			1
any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation , " @entity0 said in a new statement			1
@entity6 went further , telling @entity1 the accuser should go to jail and the lawyers representing her should be disbarred			1
he 's never even met @entity15 , he said			2
" i am telling the truth and i can prove it			2
they are lying , and i can prove it , " he told @entity1 's " @entity26			2
" " this is a zero sum game			2
either i 'll end up being disabarred and criminally charged or they will be			2
there 's no gray area here			2
" @entity6 said he was filing a sworn affidavit monday denying the accusations , and was filing a motion " to intervene in the case			1
" his legal team is " preparing disbarment and disciplinary papers , " he said			2
he challenged @entity15 to charge him with rape , the " most serious crime anyone can imagine			2
if she does , she will go to jail for filing a false rape charge			2
" @entity6 offered to waive the statute of limitations and " any immunity			1
" @entity6 threatens $ 100 million defamation suit he also challenged @entity15 ' attorneys to make their accusation in public , rather than through a " privileged legal document			1
" " they will not state on your show , ' @entity6 had sex with this woman , ' " @entity6 said			1
" because if they do that , they 're in court the very next day being sued for defamation for $ 100 million			2
" the attorneys have previously refused to do so			0
" we intend only to litigate the relevant issues in court and not to play into any sideshow attempted by anyone , " @entity15 ' attorney @entity61 said in an email to @entity1 on friday after @entity6 was quoted elsewhere in the media making similar remarks			1

his co-counsel in the case , former federal judge @entity73 , was copied on the email			0
the message included a statement from @entity15 , whom the attorneys referred to as " @entity77			0
" " i am looking forward to vindicating my rights as an innocent victim and pursuing all available recourse			0
it appears that i am now being unjustly victimized again			0
these types of aggressive attacks on me are exactly the reason why sexual abuse victims typically remain silent and the reason why i did for a long time			0
i 'm not going to be bullied back into silence			0
" " it 's the exact opposite " of trying to silence someone , @entity6 said in the @entity1 interview			1
" repeat the statements , so then i can sue you			0
" @entity15 ' attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment monday			0
the fallout follows a federal court filing alleging that " @entity77 " was forced to have sex with several men when she was a teenager			0

) case involves billionaire 's plea deal the case centers on an @entity7 billionaire			1
@entity15 and another woman are seeking to join two other women who are arguing in federal court for the @entity7 government to take a fresh look at its case involving @entity126 , who pleaded guilty some years ago in @entity105 to a state charge of prostitution solicitation			1
the investment banker agreed to a state plea deal in 2007 and began serving an 18 - month sentence in 2008 , according to the @entity132			0
