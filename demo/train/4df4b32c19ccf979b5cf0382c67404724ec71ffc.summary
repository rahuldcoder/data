@entity0 -- @entity4 @entity3 judges have heard the arguments , now they must decide whether to order @entity7 @entity6 to stand trial for a second time in the death of her former roommate			1
the judges concluded a hearing into the question early monday afternoon , and were expected to announce their decision soon			0
@entity15 spent four years in jail before an appellate court overturned her murder conviction in the 2007 death of @entity21			2
she returned to the @entity7 in 2011			0
prosecutors say that despite the appellate decision , they still believe @entity15 and her former boyfriend , @entity25 , are responsible for the death			1
" we are still convinced that they are the co-authors of @entity21 's homicide , " @entity4 news agency @entity28 quoted @entity29 , @entity4 , prosecutor @entity30 as saying			2
@entity15 , who is not in @entity4 for the hearing , is confident in the @entity4 legal system and hopes one day to return to @entity4 as a free woman , her lawyer , @entity36 , said monday			1
if the acquittal is overturned , the case will go back to an appellate court and @entity15 might have to return to @entity4			1
if she refuses , the @entity4 government could appeal to the @entity7 government for her extradition			2
but even if it does , @entity15 still not might end up before an @entity4 court			1
@entity7 officials might reject such a request because it violates the @entity7 legal principle that a criminal defendant ca n't be tried twice on the same allegation , said @entity51 , a contributor for @entity53 's " @entity54			1
" @entity4 lacks the absolute prohibition present in @entity7 law preventing authorities from retrying a criminal defendant who has been acquitted of a charge			1
" we have principles that are well - founded within our @entity63 , one of which is double jeopardy , " he said			0
" so as a result of that , i think it would be highly objectionable for the @entity7 to surrender someone to another country for which justice has already been administered and meted out			0
so i do n't think or anticipate that that would happen			0
" 2011 : @entity6 judge explains murder acquittal the case began in 2007 , after @entity15 moved to @entity29 to study at the @entity77 for one year @entity15 , then 20 , shared a room with @entity80 student @entity79 , 21			1
that november , @entity79 's semi-naked body was found at the home , with her throat slashed			0
police arrested @entity15 and @entity25 , who was her boyfriend at the time			2
2011 : was @entity4 fair to @entity6 ? two years later they were convicted of murder , but were cleared when they appealed the verdicts in 2011			1
another man , @entity93 drifter @entity21 , was convicted separately of @entity79 's killing			0
@entity95 admitted having sexual relations with @entity79 but denied killing her			0
in legal paperwork published in december 2011 , the judge in the case wrote that the jury had cleared the pair of murder for lack of evidence proving they were guilty			0
@entity15 's family said last year the appeal was unwelcome , but no cause for concern			2
" the appeal of @entity6 's acquittal by the prosecution was not unexpected as they had indicated from the day of the verdict that they would appeal , " a family statement in february 2012 said			0
2011 : @entity15 makes emotional return to @entity118 @entity15 has spent the last year and a half trying to resume a normal life , studying at the @entity121 in @entity118 , her hometown			1
she has written a book on her ordeal , titled " waiting to be heard , " which will be published next month			0
@entity126 , father of @entity25 , told @entity1 in a phone interview last year that the family was " not happy about the decision ( to appeal )			2
my son is trying to get back to normal life			1
" " we can do very little in this situation , " he said , but as @entity4 citizens , they would have to accept the court 's decision			1
" we hope that the high court will finally put the words ' the end ' to this story			0
" @entity142 reported from @entity0 ; @entity143 reported and wrote from @entity144 ; @entity1 's @entity145 also contributed to this report .			0

a decision on retrying @entity6 is expected soon
@entity53 *analyst* : even if the @entity4 court orders a retrial , the @entity7 could refuse to extradite @entity15
@entity15 and @entity25 were cleared of murdering a @entity80 student
