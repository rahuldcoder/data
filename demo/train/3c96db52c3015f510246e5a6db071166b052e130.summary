@entity1 had previously announced a loan of $ 10 million ( 7 million euros ) for humanitarian aid to the @entity10 , the rebel movement that is battling to unseat longtime @entity3 strongman @entity11			1

" there is a major lack of funds to build infrastructure , as well as a shortage of needed goods , ranging from medical supplies to food			0
