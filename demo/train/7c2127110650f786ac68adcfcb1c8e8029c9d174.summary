-- @entity3 sen. @entity2 's flip - flop approval for same - sex marriage , is just the latest change of heart on the issue by conservatives			1
even @entity9 like president @entity10 -- have turned around after opposing it			0
this change in attitude is just one of many milestones for the movement			0
here are five of the most important turning points in the same - sex marriage debate : 1993 : in a landmark case , @entity21 's @entity20 ruled that the state ca n't deny same - sex couples the right to marry unless it finds " a compelling reason " to do so			1
it orders the issue back to the state legislature , which then voted to ban gay marriage			2
this was one of earliest debates on the issue at the state level , and was a precursor to the legal battles nationwide			0
today , domestic partnerships and civil unions for same - sex couples are legal in @entity21			1
1996 : president @entity41 signed the @entity42 , or @entity42 , -- which defines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman			1
the law denies federal benefits to same - sex couples in the nine states where gay marriage is legal			1
@entity41 said he signed it because it would have tamped down calls for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage			1
only 81 out of 535 members of @entity58 opposed @entity42			0
fast - forward seventeen years to march 2013 , when @entity41 urged the @entity20 to overturn @entity42			2
he explained : " as the president who signed the act into law , i have come to believe that @entity42 is contrary to those principles and , in fact , incompatible with our @entity65			2
" 2004 : president @entity67 championed a constitutional amendment that would outlaw gay marriage			2
it was needed , he said , to stop " activist judges " from redefining marriage			0
the idea found support among @entity76 conservatives , but its supporters could n't gather enough votes			2
by the way , all this unfolded during a contentious presidential campaign			0
@entity9 @entity83 hopefuls sens. @entity84 and @entity85 opposed the amendment , but they also were against creating a specific law making same - sex marriage legal			1
2012 : for the first time , voters approved same - sex marriage statewide at the ballot box			1
similar measures had been rejected for years			0
same - sex couples became free to marry in @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			1
gay rights supporters also scored a smaller victory in @entity100 , where voters rejected a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage			0
interestingly , support for same - sex marriage came from a mixed coalition of voters			1
before 2012 , six states had already legalized gay marriage -- but via courts and legislatures -- not voters			0
2013 : for the first time , the @entity10 administration joined the legal battle against @entity117 's 2008 same - sex marriage ban			1
the @entity118 made it official in february when it filed a brief to the @entity20			0
the @entity10 administration urged the high court to invalidate the ban			0
@entity10 said that if he sat on the @entity20 , he would vote to strike down @entity123			0
the court document expressed the president 's evolution on the issue			2
in a short time he evolved from a backer of civil unions to a supporter of equality in marriage			0
dozens of high - profile @entity3 also argued in favor of same - sex marriage , in a court brief .			1
