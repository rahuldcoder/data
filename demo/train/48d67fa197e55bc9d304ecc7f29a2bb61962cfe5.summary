-- @entity1 died last month in @entity2 after being denied a lifesaving abortion			1
if she had lived in the @entity5 -- where in two months we will mark four decades of safe and legal abortion on the anniversary of the @entity10 ruling -- she likely would be alive today			1
i was a little girl when this decision overturned state bans across the country that prevented women from access to medically safe procedures			0
unlike my mother 's generation -- when women often died from self - induced abortions or back - alley abortions performed by a person with no skills or training , often under unsanitary conditions -- my siblings , friends , classmates and i grew up with the ability to make informed decisions when faced with an unintended or medically problematic pregnancy			1
worldwide , many women are unable to make personal health decisions			0
according to a @entity38 report , about 47,000 women die each year around the world from unsafe abortions			1
this accounts for about 13 % of all maternal deaths			0
most of these women die in developing countries , where severe legal restrictions and lack of access to modern medical care drive women to seek unsafe procedures			1
by contrast , abortion in the @entity5 is incredibly safe : fewer than 0.3 % of women experience complications that require hospitalization			1
but @entity57 died in a highly developed country			0
after 17 weeks of pregnancy , she went to the hospital , miscarrying and in extreme pain			0
her husband says doctors denied requests for an abortion to save her life ; after three days the fetus died , and after suffering for four days , @entity1 died of blood poisoning			1
her death in @entity2 serves as a stark reminder that living in a developed country does not necessarily protect us from backward health policies			2
lawmakers in @entity2 who defend that country 's near - total ban on abortion rely on the same politically driven arguments echoed across much of the @entity5 by opponents of women 's freedom to choose , as they try to chip away at access to safe and legal abortion			1
in @entity86 , for example , legislators are considering a bill that would ban abortion early in pregnancy , even before some women know they are pregnant			2
according to an analysis from the @entity95 , half the women in our nation live in states hostile to abortion access ; and in 2011 alone , states enacted a record 92 provisions seeking to restrict women 's access to abortion			1
this is not the legacy i wish for my children			0
i want my son and daughter to grow up in a country where they make their own health care decisions and their privacy is respected			0
unless we stand up to these attacks on women 's health and personal decision making , we are sure to hear more stories like @entity57 's -- and this time closer to home			2
senseless decisions do not just happen in other countries			0
in @entity122 , doctors refused to allow @entity123 to end her pregnancy after she learned her daughter would not survive , citing the state 's ban on abortion past 20 weeks gestation			1
instead , @entity123 was forced to deliver an infant who died moments after birth			0
evidence shows time and again that banning abortion does not make it go away -- it merely leads to more unsafe abortions and more women dying			1
some of the countries with the highest abortion rates worldwide have the most restrictive policies			0
on the other hand , countries with the lowest abortion rates tend to have more supportive abortion policies and strong policy support for contraception			0
policymakers truly interested in reducing abortion should support strong investment in contraception at home and abroad			0
under the @entity152 , millions more @entity5 will be eligible for birth control coverage without a co-pay â € ” which will have a tremendous impact for women across the country who find it a struggle to use contraception consistently because of its cost			1
the @entity5 is the largest investor in global family planning and hiv / aids programs in the world			2
we need to protect these investments from budget cuts to ensure that women everywhere can plan and space their children 's births and prevent unintended pregnancy and disease			2
as the @entity177 recently declared , access to contraception is a universal human right			0
we also need to fight for better access to safe and legal abortion at home and abroad			0
as @entity57 's case devastatingly demonstrates , even during a planned pregnancy , a woman must sometimes consider an abortion			1
the difficult decision to end a pregnancy , to choose adoption or to raise a child should be up to the woman , in consultation with her family , her faith and her doctor			2
on january 22 , when my family honors the 40th anniversary of @entity10 , i want to be able to tell my children that our country is moving forward , not turning back the clocks			2
we will remember @entity1 on that day and repeat the mantra echoed at vigils in @entity2 and around the world honoring her wholly preventable death : never again			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			0

@entity1 died in @entity2 after being denied an abortion
@entity209 : before @entity10 , women in @entity5 often died from unsafe abortions
@entity209 : abortion opponents in @entity5 are trying to end a woman 's right to free choice
@entity222 abortion does not stop it , she writes , it leads to more women dying
