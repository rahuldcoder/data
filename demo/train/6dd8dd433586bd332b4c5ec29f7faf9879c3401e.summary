-- sometimes it seems like @entity2 rules the @entity3			1
president @entity2 speaks during a town hall meeting on health care in august			1
the president 's @entity7 feed is hugely popular , with more than 2 million followers			0
funny @entity11 photos of the first family wearing @entity15 glasses went viral after the @entity11 posted them to @entity17			0
and he 's the first president who commonly addresses the nation on @entity20			0
many pundits have argued @entity2 's mastery of online social networks and his image as a @entity26 - addicted , tech - hip person helped win him the @entity28 presidency in january			1
so if the @entity29 is so internet savvy , what 's happening with health care ? as the country 's messy debate about health care reform continues , some online observers are starting to wonder if @entity2 has lost his grip on internet discourse			1
they 're also wondering if it 's possible for any one person -- no matter how powerful -- to control public dialogue on a medium like the @entity3 , where conversations are driven by millions of users instead of tv pundits and heads of state			0
the health care fight is the first time the @entity28 has had a major policy debate where all sides are represented and haggling openly online , said @entity52 , author of " @entity53 : democracy , the @entity3 , and the @entity55			1
" @entity2 's success at mobilizing grass - roots support through online networks has inspired @entity60 and interests groups to do the same , he said			1
that may give the impression that @entity2 is losing control of his online base , but it really means more people are conversing online , he said			1
" you 're definitely seeing a diversity of voices and a diversity of opinions [ online ] that i think is due to @entity2 's success , " said @entity52 , a longtime @entity67 campaign strategist			1
" it 's the great awakening			0
people realized they need to do that too			2
" partly because of the vastness of opinion and discussion online , it 's difficult for the @entity2 administration , or any single group , to control the health care debate , said @entity85 , founder of @entity86			1
all said @entity67 have made a number of " online gaffes " that have drawn attention away from their talking points			2
he said there is " so much noise " in the health care debate online that the party 's missteps are overshadowing its message			1
for example , the @entity11 raised privacy concerns after it asked people to send the administration e-mails and online writings that spread misinformation about health care reform , he said			1
still , @entity2 remains active on many social networks -- from @entity7 to @entity106 to the video - sharing site @entity108			2
and some people say he 's still doing a fine job at being an up - to - date online communicator			2
@entity112 , a staff writer for the @entity113 who has written about @entity2 and social media , said @entity2 's online communications fell off when he first took office			1
but he says the president has rebounded online during the health care debate and is doing a good job of reaching constituents through that medium			1
but that does n't mean he 's the only one talking online			0
in trying to get their message across , administration officials have " just as good a shot as some 20 - year - old college student from @entity127 , " he said			0
" it 's just they have more people behind that issue			2
they have a greater pull			0
" some have criticized the online community and @entity3 spin - masters for creating , and spreading , disinformation about proposals for health care reform			1
on the whole , though , the @entity3 conversation about the subject is healthy in part because so much information is available , said @entity145 , editor of @entity146 , a nonpartisan site that fact - checks political statements			0
" people have access now to more information than ever before and that 's generally a very positive thing , " he said			2
" although the internet can be used to spread a lot of false things , it 's also never been easier for journalists like myself to debunk these things , you know ? so on balance , the reality is we just have a whole new dimension to the national discussion on any topic and that has positives and negatives			0
" he encouraged people to check out statements made by bloggers , @entity7 users or e-mailers before considering them fact			2
prevailing images of the recent health care debate have been of constituents screaming at their legislators in a series of town hall meetings held around the county			1
@entity186 , who has reported on health care meetings in the virtual world of @entity189 , said conversations online have the potential to be much more civil and productive than those real - world town halls			1
" social media could drown them out with reason , with substance , " he said			0
" my idealistic view is that social media in general , including virtual worlds , can drown out that angry shouting			0
" @entity201 , ceo of @entity202 , an online social network for doctors , said @entity3 discussions tend to be ahead of those in the real world			0
tort reform , he said , would n't be in the public conversation if not for the fact that people can bring up that issue up on the @entity213			2
he added that medical associations claim to represent physicians but often do n't portray the nuances of peoples ' views			0
the @entity3 lets people speak for themselves , he said			0
@entity52 , the campaign consultant , said the shouting matches at health care town halls expose the limitations of online discourse today			1
but he said online debates and discussions will play increasingly important roles in public policy discussions			2
" all these new tools are still just in their infancy and they 're still being used to a large extent just like everything else is used , " he said			0
" but i do n't think that will hold			0
i think you 're starting to see people actually talking to each other			0

some say the @entity2 administration may be losing its internet savvy
others argue that more interest groups are online now , *resulting* in more noise
author says health care is first policy issue to be debated online in big way
journalist says more information is better , but that people should check facts
