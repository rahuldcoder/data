-- the unprecedented success of two @entity5 teams reaching the final of the @entity7 is down to the @entity9 's investment in young players , the chief executive of the league told @entity0 tuesday			1
@entity11 and @entity12 battle it out saturday at @entity14 to claim @entity17 club football 's most prestigious title			1
they have broken the stranglehold of the @entity20 and @entity22 's @entity21 in providing the the @entity7 winners and @entity24 claims the major factor has been a crop of home grown talent in both teams			2
" on saturday we will have 16 or 17 @entity5 players on the pitch , " he said			0
@entity24 said that decisions taken by the @entity5 federation and the @entity9 after a poor showing at the @entity37 in 2000 paved the way for the current triumphs at both club and international level			2
" each club that wanted to play in the top two tiers of the @entity9 -- 36 clubs -- had to have youth academy , " he said			1
" today more than 100 million euros per year is invested and 5,000 players are educated in the program			0
" by the end of the first decade of the 21st century , it was clear @entity5 football had a promising crop of talent and at the 2009 @entity17 under - 21 championships the evidence was overwhelming			0
a team containing goalkeeeper @entity56 and defenders @entity57 and @entity59 , who are all likely to feature in saturday 's showpiece final , thrashed @entity61 4 - 0 in the final			2
@entity63 and @entity64 , ironically now in a @entity66 side shocked by @entity12 in this season 's @entity7 semifinals , were also in that @entity5 team			1
" virtually every member of today 's @entity5 national team played in that squad , " said @entity24			0
his views have been echoed by @entity76 contributor @entity74 , who played for @entity11 as the youth revolution got underway			1
former @entity61 international @entity74 said the @entity20 should learn the lessons of the @entity9 experiment and give more opportunities to young players			0
one area where the @entity20 does still reign is in overall revenues , but @entity24 , who comes from a marketing business background , believes the @entity9 is catching up			0
" we have the second biggest turnover of the major leagues although far behind the @entity20			0
" we have sold our tv rights in 208 countries but we are seeing increased interest because of the @entity7 success			0
" even he though was surprised by seeing two @entity9 sides in the final			1
" @entity11 is probably not such a big surprise -- it 's their third final in four years -- but @entity12 getting there with a relatively young team is , " he said			1
@entity12 won the trophy back in 1997 in their only final appearance , @entity11 , with @entity74 in the line up , last took the honors in 2001 and will be looking to put their shock defeat to @entity105 in last year 's final on their home @entity106 behind them			1
but for 44 - year - old @entity24 whichever team wins it will not matter as the @entity9 goes from strength to strength .			2
