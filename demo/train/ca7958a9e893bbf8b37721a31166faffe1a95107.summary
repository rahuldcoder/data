@entity0 , an internet savant who at a young age shaped the online era by co-developing @entity5 and @entity6 and later became a digital activist , has committed suicide			1
@entity0 's body was found friday evening in @entity10 , said @entity11 , a spokeswoman with the @entity14 medical examiner 's office			1
the 26 - year - old had hanged himself in his apartment			2
his family and partner said they were " in shock , and have not yet come to terms with his passing			2
" " @entity0 's insatiable curiosity , creativity , and brilliance ; his reflexive empathy and capacity for selfless , boundless love ; his refusal to accept injustice as inevitable -- these gifts made the world , and our lives , far brighter , " they said in a statement			1
" we 're grateful for our time with him , to those who loved him and stood with him , and to all of those who continue his work for a better world			2
" a prodigy , @entity0 was behind some of the @entity48 's defining moments , soaring to heights that many developers only dream of			1
at the same time , he was plagued by legal problems arising from his aggressive activism , and he was also known to suffer depression , a personal matter that he publicly revealed on his blog			1
technology activist @entity56 met @entity0 when he was 14 or 15 , @entity56 said on his blog			1
" in so many ways , he was an adult , even then , with a kind of intense , fast intellect that really made me feel like he was part and parcel of the internet society , " @entity56 wrote			0
" but @entity0 was also a person who 'd had problems with depression for many years , " @entity56 blogged			1
he added that " whatever problems @entity0 was facing , killing himself did n't solve them			1
whatever problems @entity0 was facing , they will go unsolved forever			1
" at age 14 , @entity0 co-wrote the @entity5 specification			1
he was later admitted to @entity73 , but dropped out after a year because , as he wrote in a blog post , " i did n't find it a very intellectual atmosphere , since most of the other kids seemed profoundly unconcerned with their studies			0
" what he did next was help develop @entity6 , the social news website that was eventually bought by heavyweight publisher @entity81 in 2006			2
@entity0 then engaged in @entity48 digital activism , co-founding @entity84 , a political action group that campaigns against internet censorship			1
but he pushed the legal limits , allegedly putting him on the wrong side of the law			2
in 2011 , he was arrested in @entity90 for alleged computer fraud and illegally obtaining documents from protected computers			0
he was later indicted in an incident in which he allegedly stole millions of online documents from the @entity96			2
he pleaded not guilty in september , according to @entity96 's " @entity98 " newspaper			1
two years earlier , the @entity99 investigated him after he released millions of @entity101 federal court documents online			2
the alleged hacking was significant because the documents came from the government - run @entity104 to @entity106 , or @entity107 , which typically charges a fee , which was 8 cents a page in 2009			0
no charges were filed in that case , but on october 5 , 2009 , he posted online his @entity99 file that he apparently requested from the agency			0
he redacted the @entity99 agents ' names and his personal information , he said			0
in that file , the @entity99 said more than 18 million pages with a value of about $ 1.5 million were downloaded from @entity107 in september 2008 to @entity0 's home in @entity121 , @entity122			1
" as i hoped , it 's truly delightful , " he wrote of his @entity99 file			2
@entity0 's family and partner recalled his " commitment to social justice , " and called his death " the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach			1
" they criticized @entity101 prosecutors for seeking " an exceptionally harsh array of charges ( for ) an alleged crime that had no victims , " and @entity96 because it did not " stand up for @entity0			1
" " decisions made by officials in the @entity142 's office and at @entity96 contributed to his death , " they said			1
@entity143 , a spokeswoman for the @entity101 @entity145 , declined to comment on @entity0 's case , citing respect for the family			1
his funeral will be held tuesday at a synagogue in @entity121			0
@entity0 , who completed a fellowship at @entity153 's @entity152 , frequently blogged about his life , success and personal struggles			1
in some instances , he wrote about death			2
" there is a moment , immediately before life becomes no longer worth living , when the world appears to slow down and all its myriad details suddenly become brightly , achingly apparent , " he wrote in a 2007 post titled " @entity165			0
" on november 27 , 2007 , he blogged about " depressed mood			0
" " surely there have been times when you 've been sad			0
perhaps a loved one has abandoned you or a plan has gone horribly awry			0
you wonder whether it 's worth going on , " he wrote			2
" everything you think about seems bleak â€” the things you 've done , the things you hope to do , the people around you			0
you want to lie in bed and keep the lights off			0
depressed mood is like that , only it does n't come for any reason and it does n't go for any either			0
" at best , you tell yourself that your thinking is irrational , that it is simply a mood disorder , that you should get on with your life			0
but sometimes that is worse			0
you feel as if streaks of pain are running through your head , you thrash your body , you search for some escape but find none			0
and this is one of the more moderate forms , " he wrote			0
people we 've lost in 2013 : the lives they lived			0
