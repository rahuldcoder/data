-- it 's been a while between celebrations for @entity4 , but the @entity6 golfer feels he is regaining the form that took him to the top of the world rankings			1
back in 2010 , @entity4 was the man who ended @entity9 ' record 281 consecutive weeks as no. 1			1
he stayed there for four months , and returned to the summit for a few weeks in 2011 , but has been in danger of becoming the sport 's " nearly man " after failing to capitalize on strong positions in the four majors			0
before sunday 's triumph at the @entity20 , @entity4 's last tournament win was at another lower - tier @entity22 event in @entity24 two years ago			1
having finished seventh at the masters at @entity28 this month , the 40 - year - old believes he is back on course after starting work with a new coach and reuniting with his old caddy @entity31			2
" i was going back to what i had done before because it had worked , " said @entity4 , who won his 23rd @entity22 title with his 13th victory in @entity34			1
" it 's started to work already -- the last couple of weeks i 've played well in @entity39 and at the masters last week and this week i 've obviously played very well			0
" now i feel like i 've got a short game and starting to roll a few putts in			0
it makes a helluva difference if you can get up - and - down if you miss a few greens , and it keeps the momentum going			2
" @entity4 won by seven shots from @entity49 teammate @entity48 , @entity52 's 2010 @entity51 champion @entity50 and @entity54 's @entity53			2
he had led compatriot @entity55 by one shot going into the final round , and extended that advantage to four when play was halted for four hours due to the possibility of a lightning strike			1
@entity55 dropped even further off the pace after the resumption and finished tied for 13th with a six - over - par 78			0
@entity4 -- who won the @entity65 event in 1997 before it became co-sanctioned -- finished with a birdie as he signed for a bogey - free 68 , while 71st - ranked @entity53 shot 67 , @entity50 made 68 and @entity48 70			2
@entity68 's @entity67 , who made headlines on friday when he leaped into a water hazard to avoid a swarm of giant hornets , tied for eighth place after closing with 67			0
meanwhile , @entity74 claimed her first victory since 2010 on saturday , triumphing at the @entity77 's @entity76 in her native @entity78			0
the former teen prodigy , now 24 , followed up her runner - up finish at the season 's opening major tournament -- the @entity83 -- as she won by two shots from fellow @entity86 @entity85			0
world no. 1 @entity87 of @entity89 was third .			1

former world no. 1 @entity4 ends 22 - month for a @entity22 title
@entity6 romps to seven - stroke victory at @entity20 on sunday
play is halted for more than four hours due to *threat* of lightning
