-- he should n't even have been playing but @entity3 striker @entity2 played a vital role in ensuring his side held @entity6 to a 2 - 2 draw in an engrossing @entity9 quarterfinal in the @entity11 capital on tuesday			1
the @entity12 was originally banned for the first leg but after winning an appeal with @entity16 last week , the 31 - year - old scored @entity3 's first equalizer before setting up their second for @entity19 , who scored with the very last kick of an entertaining game			1
@entity6 's sporting director @entity22 had raised questions about @entity2 's eligibility before the match , after @entity3 succeeded in halving a two - game ban following the former @entity6 player 's dismissal against @entity29 in the @entity30			1
@entity22 may have been shaking his head in knowing fashion at the end , as may coach @entity34 who returned to the @entity6 bench for the first time in two months following cancer treatment as the @entity11 league leaders hosted their @entity40 counterparts			2
the four - time @entity42 champions led at halftime with @entity44 having converted @entity46 ' exquisite pass after 38 minutes but @entity6 fans will be worried by the hamstring pull the @entity49 suffered at the end of the first period			1
it prevented him from reappearing for the second half and in the absence of a player with 57 goals , @entity34 's side struggled to break down a @entity3 team who stuck to their game plan , one which featured a surprise call - up for former @entity64 midfielder @entity63			1
the @entity66 man , 37 , was playing his first @entity9 tie since appearing for @entity68 in 2010 and departed -- moments after being booked -- with 20 minutes to play , whereupon the drama began to unfold			0
eleven minutes from time , @entity2 -- who signed a five - year deal with @entity6 in 2009 but whose spell at the @entity73 was so unhappy he left after just twelve months -- converted from close range , despite being in an offside position , as he reacted quickest to a towering header against the post by the outstanding @entity78			1
with two minutes left , @entity3 's hard work seemed empty as @entity80 converted a penalty but redemption came in the 94th minute as @entity2 -- who had had a goal disallowed moments earlier -- guided a knockdown to @entity19 , who fired home thanks to a slight deflection			1
" they have an amazing team who keep the ball very well but in the first half , we had some amazing chances and if we had put one of them away it could have been different , " @entity63 told @entity89 television after the match			0
" i think we deserved the draw			0
i 'm enjoying being part of these nights again			0
they do n't get better than this			0
we 'll go to their place and it could be difficult , but there 's no reason why we ca n't get a result			0
" " we all hope @entity44 is fit and ready to go - we wish him the best , " added @entity63 , who had warmly embraced the @entity49 before the game			1
the late equalizer ensured that @entity3 -- whose fortunes have immeasurably improved in recent times thanks to the significant spending of the club 's @entity119 owners -- defended their six - year unbeaten home record in @entity42			1
@entity6 , meanwhile , have now won just three of their last 15 knock - out ties away from home in the @entity9			2
" we have paid a heavy price because we lost @entity44 and ( @entity128 ) @entity127 , who could be out for four to six weeks , " said assistant @entity6 coch @entity124			1
" with @entity44 we shall see what the scans say on wednesday			2
" " there were also some questionable refereeing decisions and what is not up for debate is that we deserved better			0
@entity2 's goal was certainly offside			2
i do n't know what this will do for @entity3 's morale in that they twice came back but for us it is a favorable result			0
" the dramatic finale added extra gloss to a game which @entity3 , whose average attendances were worryingly low just two years ago , say they could have sold up to a million tickets for , with the club contesting a first @entity9 quarterfinal in 18 years -- with the return leg coming next wednesday			0
in @entity152 , it was business as usual for @entity154 as last year 's @entity9 runners up hosted @entity156 three days after thrashing @entity157 9 - 2 in the @entity158			1
like the game in @entity161 , this clash also pitted league leaders against one another -- with @entity154 demonstrating their strength in depth by starting with @entity166 , who netted four goals against @entity157 , on the bench			1
the hosts were the far stronger side in @entity171 and dominated proceedings in a 2 - 0 win , so much so that they may feel a little aggrieved to only lead by goals from @entity176 -- after 26 seconds -- and @entity177			1
" it was a very intense game and our attacking players invested a lot into defensive work , which displayed great commitment , " said goalscorer @entity177			0
" it 's a bit of a shame that we did n't score a third goal			0
" @entity154 were also rocked by a groin injury to @entity188 , which could keep the midfielder out for six weeks			2
" we know there is still the return leg to play and we can certainly hope for a comeback , " rallied @entity156 midfielder @entity191			0
" @entity154 played better than us for the entire 90 minutes			0
it was very difficult for us to play our normal game			0
" by the time they meet again , @entity154 may be the @entity152 champions as they can wrap up the title on saturday should the @entity158 leaders , who have a 20 - point lead , win at @entity201 .			2

@entity2 scores one and makes on as @entity3 hold @entity6 to a 2 - 2 draw in @entity161
@entity44 opens the scoring but is forced off with a hamstring injury
@entity154 impress in a *comprehensive* 2 - 0 defeat of @entity156
