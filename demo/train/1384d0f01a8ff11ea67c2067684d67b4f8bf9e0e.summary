-- in 2009 , @entity1 released the song " @entity3 " from his album " @entity5 saturday night			1
" in it , he sings about all the cultural changes he 's witnessed in his life , including the evolving demographics of the country			2
he includes glowing references to the rev. @entity12 and @entity13			0
the election of @entity15 inspired him to write it			0
it 's important to keep all of that in mind because for some , @entity1 's latest song , " @entity20 , " is making him look like an intentional one			1
i am reminded of an adage ( but with a twist ) : no good ditty goes unpunished			0
" @entity32 " attempts to address a subject matter so few artists in country music are willing to do , which makes @entity1 a brave man in so many ways			1
@entity1 , @entity34 team up for song country music fans are notorious for excommunicating those whom they perceive as undesirable ( see @entity38 , @entity39 )			1
despite @entity1 's immense popularity , if he makes one misstep , everything could be snatched away			1
and attempting to bring a blue state conversation to red state radio could be one of those missteps			0
" i 'm not proud that people 's ancestors were beaten and held in bondage , " @entity1 told @entity48			1
" but i am sure as heck proud of the farm i live on and the @entity54 soldier buried there			0
" infusing such a dichotomy into a song can be powerful			2
unfortunately , " @entity32 " sucks as a song			1
the chorus reeks like a ' 90s boy band ballad			0
but its greatest sin is that in @entity1 's effort to push for racial harmony , it miscasts the country 's racial tension -- with emphasis on the @entity54 flag and @entity68 -- as a distant thing of the past			1
meanwhile , those of us in the real world are reading stories about an elected official referring to @entity77 as " w --- --			0
" no , it 's not the 1960s			0
but if racial tension was really that far back in our rearview , why are students at @entity83 in @entity84 fighting to desegregate its prom ? or why was the notoriously liberal @entity87 impressed with then - sen. @entity15 's lack of a " @entity89 " ? there is a way to talk about race without being consumed with the past or denial of our present			2
but obviously " @entity32 " did not find that route			2
as a result , @entity1 is getting hammered for pouring faux apologies on top of a stack of syrupy denials			2
the most scathing review came from @entity103 , which said , " @entity1 , i do n't think you 're the one paying for the ' mistake ' of buying and selling human beings			1
" the song is bad			0
but the intention is not			0
his heart is not bad			0
the questions that " @entity32 " raised are worth asking			1
@entity1 just did it so awkwardly			1
part of the problem with addressing racism is that white people are so afraid of saying -- or in @entity1 's case -- singing the wrong thing			1
but if we 're going to usher in the next wave of tolerance , allowing for these " mistakes " is important			1
besides , minorities do n't have all of the answers on the topic either			0
@entity34 , who is featured in the song , sings : " now my chains are gold but i 'm still misunderstood			0
... " damn ll -- really dude ? @entity34 's proud of ' @entity20 ' anyway , i hope " @entity32 " does n't scare @entity1 away from continuing to push himself or his audience			1
he could 've gone the vacuous love song route , but he aspired for something more			0
looking at the results of the 2012 election , the resources being allocated by the @entity138 to reach minorities , and the push by both parties for immigration reform , i 'd say a song about racial harmony performed by two men from opposite sides of the track was worth pursuing			2
yes , the mockery and " @entity150 " skit will come			0
but let 's hope the usual knee - jerky " he 's a racist " label is left behind because @entity1 is not a racist			1
in fact , he 's one of the most kindhearted people you could meet			0
and over the years he 's recorded some incredibly powerful songs such as " @entity159 " and " @entity160			0
" @entity1 performed " @entity3 " in the @entity161 for the president			2
and the song hit no. 2 on @entity166 's country music chart			1
given that , i 'd say the impetus behind " @entity32 " was worth chasing -- even if he and @entity34 tripped and fell along the way			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			2

@entity172 : @entity1 's song " @entity20 " provokes *criticism*
@entity172 : it was brave of @entity1 to try to address racial issues in country music
he says that " @entity32 " raises *provocative* questions , but @entity1 did it awkwardly
@entity172 : if we 're going to usher in more tolerance , we have to allow for " mistakes "
