@entity1 gov. @entity0 signed a law tuesday that drastically raises the safety requirements for abortion clinics to operate -- a measure that he says " has been endorsed by pro-life groups across @entity7			1
" but @entity8 immediately warned of " an almost certain legal challenge , " saying the new law 's requirements " would be difficult for nearly all providers to meet " and would shut down clinics			1
@entity0 , a @entity14 , hailed the new law			0
" as a physician , and as a governor , i am proud to sign this legislation , " he said in a statement			2
" this bill provides appropriate standards of care			0
" doctors who provide abortions must have admitting privileges at local hospitals , the governor 's office said			1
a similar new law in @entity30 has put that state 's only abortion provider " on the verge of closing " because of such an admitting privileges requirement , @entity8 said			1
that clinic is challenging the @entity30 law in federal court , saying the state would end up banning abortion because the clinic 's doctors have n't been able to gain the privileges			1
@entity43 , vice president of public policy for @entity45 , said that " medical experts agree that laws requiring admitting privileges for abortion do n't increase health or safety for a woman			2
" they just limit a woman 's access to safe and legal abortion , " @entity43 said in a statement			2
" as a high - quality health care provider working every day to support women 's health and safety , @entity8 is evaluating every possible option to protect the health of women in the face of this dangerous law and blatant attack on women 's health and rights , " she said			2
the @entity1 measure passed by overwhelming majorities in both houses of the state legislature			0
@entity73 , speaker of the @entity74 , has said , " with the passage of this legislation , we are doing everything we can to ensure the procedure is performed in a safe and healthy environment			0
" @entity82 governor signs law banning most abortions once signed , @entity1 's new law would require abortion clinics to meet the standards of an " ambulatory surgical center , " @entity84 , a spokeswoman for @entity8 , has said			1
this means the state 's five abortion clinics would have to remodel to increase the sizes of rooms and doorways			2
" it puts an undue burden on existing facilities			0
all of this makes it harder to access health care , " @entity84 said			0
the new law also requires doctors at the clinics to ask pregnant minors under age 16 seeking an abortion who the father is , according to a summary of the legislation provided by @entity73 's office			1
the pregnant minor will be able to refuse to give the father 's name and age			0
@entity119 lawmakers back nation 's most restrictive abortion bill if the girl provides the name and the father is two or more years older than the girl , the facility will have to report the pregnant girl and father to police , the legislation says			0
the legislation is designed to prevent abuse			0
the law is the centerpiece of the " @entity135 " section of the @entity74 @entity14 caucus 's 2013 legislative agenda			0
the law 's @entity74 sponsor , rep. @entity136 , a @entity14 from @entity137 , @entity1 , said abortion clinics truly dedicated to care " will embrace this legislation rather than oppose it			1
" for far too long , @entity1 has had more health regulations in place to protect your cat or dog at a vet clinic than it does for a woman receiving an abortion ; this law will correct that shameful disparity , " @entity136 said in a statement .			1
