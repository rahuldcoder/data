-- a freelance @entity2 cameraman with @entity4 is " reasonably stable " a day after arriving at a @entity6 hospital , though a doctor there cautioned tuesday it is much too early to say he 'll make a swift and smooth recovery officials at @entity12 offered few details about @entity4 patient @entity15 's condition and treatment , beyond saying that he was receiving an experimental drug known as brincidofovir , or @entity20			1
the fact they did n't sound any alarms is n't altogether surprising , given @entity15 was able to walk onto the plane that took him to the @entity26 with assistance and his father , dr. @entity28 , told @entity29 on sunday that his son was feeling " not that ill. " but dr. @entity31 , the medical director of the hospital 's biocontainment unit , said tuesday that the 33 - year - old @entity15 still has a ways to go in his @entity4 fight			1
" with @entity4 patients in general , sometimes they come in early and they do n't look that sick , but later they develop complications with gastrointestinal issues , fluid loss , diarrhea , high fever and other complications , so it is early in the course , " @entity31 said			1
" so we will have to see how it goes			0
" that includes waiting to see what , if any effect brincidofovir has on @entity15			2
@entity31 described this drug as " an antiviral medication that has been used in a number of other infections			2
" dr. @entity56 , the @entity6 hospital 's associate medical director , said this experimental medicine was chosen " based on the @entity59 ( and @entity60 ) and our assessment for other products that had been utilized for the treatment of @entity4			1
" " we ca n't actually tell how he 's responded yet , " @entity56 added			0
" it 's too early to say			0
" the 33 - year - old -- who had also worked for @entity67 and @entity68 -- started presenting symptoms on october 1 , about two weeks after arriving in the @entity4 - wracked @entity71 capital of @entity72			1
a reporter asked tuesday if @entity15 might have gotten the deadly virus while cleaning a car that he used to transport someone suffering with @entity4			1
@entity31 said that was possible , depending on a few factors including " how sick the patient was in the car			0
" " if they just had a fever than that 's very different from a patient that was actively vomiting or having diarrhea or bleeding , " @entity31 said			0
" contact with bodily fluids like that actually can transmit this disease			0
" who are the @entity92 patients ? official : no one knew woman who infected @entity96 had @entity4 meanwhile , the lone person to be diagnosed with @entity4 in the @entity26 -- @entity96 , a @entity71 citizen who arrived in @entity98 on september 20 -- remains in critical condition at @entity100			1
his nephew , @entity102 , pointed to a few positive developments including that @entity96 's liver is " doing very well , " his blood pressure is like that of " a normal person , his diarrhea " has slowed " and " his fever is pretty much gone			2
" at the same time , the rev. @entity109 -- who is serving as a family spokesman -- noted that " the infection around the liver and the lungs appear to be quite questionable at this stage			0
" " we 're not quite ready to say that ( @entity96 has turned the corner ) , because the doctors would not say that , " said @entity109			2
" but the upbeat was that they gave us the three or four good news signs ... i left hopeful			2
" the family continued to fight accusations that @entity96 lied on a travel questionnaire about his exposure to @entity4 prior to coming to the @entity26 , thus putting many people at risk			1
some in @entity71 have claimed that he helped a woman who suffered from , and ultimately died , from @entity4 but did n't admit to it			1
" he helped a pregnant woman to get health care and she died , which was a noble thing to do , " @entity109 said , insisting that @entity96 did not know the woman had @entity4			1
this story was backed up tuesday by @entity136 , a member of the @entity4 task force in the community where @entity96 and the woman , @entity140 , lived			1
according to @entity141 , at the time @entity96 filled out that questionnaire and left @entity71 on september 19 " we had no evidence to suggest that ( @entity140 ) had died from @entity4			1
" " it was only after , over the following days , those who 'd come into contact with her started falling ill that we deduced she 'd had @entity4 , " said @entity145			2
" we instated a quarantine on the community on ( october 1 ) and are in the process of identifying all those who came in contact with @entity140			0
" @entity145 added that " so far we 've identified over a 100 people " who might have been infected by @entity140			0
" and that 's just the beginning , " he said			0
@entity26 with ' high - risk exposure ' released , no symptoms an @entity26 doctor who 'd been hospitalized and isolated after a high - risk exposure to @entity4 was released tuesday with no symptoms of the deadly virus , officials said			1
he was admitted to the @entity168 in @entity169 , @entity170 , last month for observation			0
the patient was volunteering at an ebola treatment unit in @entity175 when " a needle stick injury " caused the scare , the @entity172 said in a statement			1
" the initial hospitalization was characterized by a brief period of fever that was subsequently determined to not be related to infection with ebola virus , " the statement said			0
the patient , who " feels well and has no fever , " will remain at home and check his temperature twice a day until the end of a 21 - day observation period , the statement said			0
@entity193 staffer from @entity194 infected a staff member for @entity193 , which is also known as @entity193 , has come down with @entity4 , the non-profit agency announced tuesday			1
the @entity194 national -- who was not named -- contracted the virus while working in the @entity175 city of @entity200 , according to doctors without @entity202			0
the staffer was put in isolation on sunday and will be moved to @entity205 for treatment			0
@entity193 is one of several nonprofit agencies that have sent staffers and volunteers to @entity211 , sometimes at great personal risk			0
dr. @entity214 , for instance , was working for the nondenominational evangelical christian international relief organization @entity215 when he contracted the virus in @entity72 in @entity71			2
@entity217 , another @entity26 , was with the international missionary group @entity218 when she got the disease in the same place and at about the same time			2
senator : suspend most travel visas from @entity4 - hit region sen. @entity224 , a @entity226 @entity225 , on tuesday called for the @entity26 government to temporarily suspend most travel visas issued to those coming from the @entity211 nations that have been ravaged most by @entity4			1
writing to secretary of state @entity231 , @entity224 suggested that one way to prevent the virus from spreading into the @entity26 would be to clamp down both on " unnecessary travel to the @entity26 under existing visas and the issuance of new visas for citizens of countries that the @entity59 identifies as areas with high rates of infections			1
" currently , @entity96 is the only person to be diagnosed with the virus in the @entity26 , though authorities have warned that number may grow			1
the administration of president @entity248 , also a @entity225 , has thus far refused to prevent people from coming into the @entity26 from the ebola - hit region			1
so have most other countries			0
yet @entity224 argued that policy should change , saying , " considering the changing events and overall magnitude of the situation , it may be time to reexamine the travel issue from the standpoint of visas			0
" not everyone is embracing this plan , however			0
@entity109 , for one , said tuesday that taking such steps could hurt the economies of longtime @entity26 allies like @entity71			1
" we should quarantine the disease , not quarantine nations and not quarantine airline flights , " the civil rights leader said			0
" we should not panic			0
" nurses union poll : @entity26 hospitals are n't prepared for all the pronouncements that the @entity26 is prepared to notice , control and combat @entity4 , one major player in this fight appears to disagree : the nation 's nurses			1
the @entity26 ' largest nurses union , @entity281 , released a survey tuesday in which 85 % of respondents said that nurses have n't been able to interact or ask questions at their hospitals about @entity4			1
according to the same poll -- which includes responses from 1,600 registered nurses in 35 states -- more than three - quarters of the responding nurses said their hospitals have n't communicated to them any policy about what to do if an @entity4 patient is admitted			1
its not just about education and communication , but having the physical tools to deal with such highly contagious cases			0
nearly 40 % of the respondents , from more than 300 hospitals , believe their facilities do n't have plans to properly equip so - called isolation rooms with things like plastic covered mattresses and pillows			2
one - third weighed in that their hospitals do n't have enough protective gowns or eye - protection goggles or shields			2
" handing out a piece of paper with a link to the ( @entity59 ) or telling nurses just to look at the @entity59 website -- as we have heard some hospitals are doing -- is not preparedness , " said nurse @entity315 , who heads the union 's disaster relief program			2
" hospitals can and must do better , and we should have uniform national standards and readiness			0
" @entity0 's @entity328 and @entity329 contributed to this report .			0
