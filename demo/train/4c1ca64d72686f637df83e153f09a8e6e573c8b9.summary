-- the @entity1 began holding hearings monday afternoon on proposals to end birthright citizenship under the 14th amendment for @entity7 - born children of illegal immigrants			1
lawmakers in a total of 40 states are considering similar proposals " to correct the monumental misapplication of the 14th amendment of the @entity17 , " according to the legislators ' new group , @entity13			0
the 14th amendment to the @entity17 , which was ratified in the wake of the @entity20 , provides in part that " all persons born or naturalized in the @entity7 , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the @entity7 and of the state wherein they reside			1
" the provision has the effect of granting " birthright " citizenship to anyone born in the @entity7 , even if both of the child 's parents are in the country illegally			1
the @entity36 proposals , introduced by @entity37 two weeks ago and quickly opposed by @entity38 , are the latest measures following new @entity36 laws that seek to crack down on illegal immigration but have landed up in court			1
sponsors of this latest legislation have said they hope the bills , if one becomes law , also will provoke a lawsuit so that the @entity7 @entity48 can re-examine the meaning of the 14th @entity18 's citizenship clause			1
@entity51 , spokesman for the state senate 's @entity37 majority , which holds 21 of the chamber 's 30 seats , said the judiciary committee is scheduled to hear two hours of testimony from supporters and opponents of two bills seeking to end birthright citizenship for babies born on @entity7 soil to illegal immigrants			1
under the proposals , @entity36 would create a special class of birth certificates for children who are born to parents who ca n't prove their citizenship			1
the committee is chaired by the bills ' @entity75 sponsor , @entity72 , said @entity51			0
" these folks are essentially gaming the system to put themselves ahead of the line , " @entity72 told @entity0 , referring to illegal immigrants giving birth to children in the @entity7 as a way for their children to have citizenship			1
a similar measure is sponsored in the @entity87 by rep. @entity88 , whose chamber has yet to schedule a hearing , @entity51 said			1
" obviously with this issue , there 's going to be a lot of debate on it , there 's going to be a lot of people speaking on it , " @entity51 said of monday 's scheduled two - hour hearing			1
if approved , the legislation would apply only to children born after the law went into effect or after a ruling from the expected court action , @entity88 said			2
advocates of the @entity36 proposals and others like them being planned in several states argue how during an 1866 congressional debate , @entity7 rep. @entity111 of @entity112 , considered one of the fathers of the 14th amendment , said " ... every human being born within the jurisdiction of the @entity7 of parents not owing allegiance to any foreign sovereignty is , in the language of your @entity17 itself , a natural born citizen ...			1
" @entity126 state rep. @entity125 , a @entity37 who 's the founder of the @entity128 , said that @entity111 's comment is the basis for his group 's efforts in several states to form a compact defining the 14th amendment			0
they argue that the reference to " parents not owing allegiance to any foreign sovereignty " means the 14th amendment was not intended to apply to children born of citizens from other countries			2
" it 's very important for those who are in elected office to uphold and defend the @entity17 and to ensure the @entity17 is applied correctly and the laws of our nation are the result of the correct application , " @entity125 told @entity0			0
" that is the only way we 're going to protect @entity7 lives , liberties , and property from the illegal alien invasion that 's occurring on our soil			1
" by noon monday , several dozen members of @entity159 and other community organizations gathered outside the @entity75 in @entity161 to participate in what was supposed to be a " one - thousand baby chain " protesting the @entity75 hearing , which began at 2 p.m. ( 4 p.m. et )			0
the hearing ended later monday afternoon without the committee taking any action on the legislation			0
" our legislators need to stop these incredibly expensive , ' quick - fix ' approaches to a broken immigration system , " @entity169 , executive director of @entity159 , said in a statement			0
" we need legislators with political spine to say that we need to protect all children , protect our @entity17 and fix our immigration system			0
" @entity75 minority leader @entity177 , a @entity178 , called the proposal legislation " a waste of time " and unconstitutional			2
he told @entity0 the proposed legislation would also seek to create an interstate compact between @entity36 and other willing states that would recognize the proposed new class of birth certificates for non-citizens			2
" @entity36 's fiscal situation is among the worst , if not the worst , in this country			2
i ca n't believe we 're wasting our time on this , " @entity177 said			0
given how sponsors ultimately seek a lawsuit before the @entity7 @entity48 , @entity177 said : " it 's really misplaced priorities			1
" @entity0 legal analyst @entity195 said the @entity7 @entity48 is unlikely to take up such a case			1
" this is not something that the @entity48 is going to revisit , " @entity195 said			2
" it 's not like it 's been controversial for 150 years			0
" this is really a frivolous endeavor , " he said			0
" the law is so clear on this issue			0
the language of the 14th @entity18 says all persons born in the @entity7 are citizens			2
it does n't matter who your parents are or if they 're in this country legally or illegally			0
" this group is better off trying to amend the @entity17 than to pursue this law , which in my opinion is unconstitutional , " @entity195 said			0
@entity0 's @entity216 contributed to this report .			0
