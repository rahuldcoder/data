all this in a postcard - ready setting : the 3,900 - acre @entity16 , surrounded by @entity18 's mountains and dusted with an average snowfall of 120 inches			1
( that 's twice as much as @entity21 , @entity22 , and @entity23 , @entity24 ! ) here 's our guide to planning a frosty yet cozy winter weekend			1
@entity0 : escape to the coast where to stay : @entity30 set on the shore of @entity16 , @entity30 has nailed the yin and yang of a winter retreat			1
the @entity34 - style bed - and - breakfast has a wraparound porch with views of the lake , while a massive stone fireplace dominates the lobby			0
outside , a fire pit in the snow is fully stocked with marshmallows			1
every detail speaks of this inn 's devotion to comfort , from rooms with gas fireplaces and lake - view balconies to the comfort food : pumpkin flapjacks and egg scrambles by morning and a complimentary happy hour with wine and hors d'oeuvres each eve			1
@entity57 may be a 45 - minute drive from the lake , but this full - service resort is a destination all on its own			0
sitting on the @entity63 , the lodge enjoys lake - effect snow , with access to 13 miles of groomed cross-country ski and snowshoe trails			1
a double - sided stone fireplace warms a three - floor lodge complete with an impressive library , a full bar and a restaurant that leans heavily on local fare ( wild game meatloaf , anyone ? )			0
sign up for one of the lodge 's all - day culinary classes and you can even be chef for a day			1

we found a five - bedroom lodge with a hot tub , pool table , wood - burning fireplace and views of the lake			0
where to play : @entity103 on a set of snowshoes ( it 's as easy as walking , we swear ! ) for a two - hour guided hike through an old - growth hemlock forest in @entity103			2
your ultimate destination is @entity112 , the highest waterfall in @entity18 , which , with any luck , will be frozen during your winter visit -- a spectacular photo op. consider signing up for the four - hour @entity117 , which includes camera instruction from a pro nature photographer			1
@entity57 there 's no shortage of cross-country trails in the @entity16 area , but the most civilized option might be at @entity57 , where in - house rentals and lessons make the experience a cinch for beginners			1
to entice visitors even further , co-owner @entity130 has set up a warming station with a bonfire pit and benches where skiers can rest and guests can roast marshmallows			0
@entity0 : 10 best getaways @entity139 the @entity141 huskies at @entity139 may be the happiest locals in @entity16			1

go during the week to avoid the crowds and score a deal			0
@entity166 does it get any cozier than snuggling beneath a blanket while sipping hot chocolate in a horse - drawn sleigh ? hardly			0
@entity166 offers sleigh rides on a gorgeous family - owned farm throughout the day , but we say reserve a private excursion under the stars			0
where to eat : @entity177 serves creative wood - fired flatbread pizzas , such as the @entity180 ( with grilled chicken , @entity183 sauce and blue cheese ) and such treats as the s'mores dessert pizza made with @entity187 , graham crackers and marshmallows			0
