it ended a long wait for the @entity13 giants who have not headed the @entity16 standings since winning the title in 2008			0
their poor form last season led to the departure of former @entity23 coach @entity22 , but his replacement @entity25 has also been under pressure after a slow start to the current campaign			0
but since the midwinter break , @entity5 have returned to winning ways and have been level on points with leaders @entity32 , who had a better goal difference			2
@entity32 's 0 - 0 draw at home to @entity38 on saturday extended their unbeaten @entity7 run to a record 24 games , but left the door ajar for @entity42 to take advantage			1
their three - point haul on sunday gives them a two - point cushion at the top but it was not until the 78th minute that they made the breakthrough with a fine goal from @entity1			2
the influential playmaker left @entity9 goalkeeper @entity53 no chance with a fierce shot			2
visitors @entity9 were still missing their new signing @entity58 through injury and could create little up front			2
in sunday 's other game , @entity61 continued their slump with a ninth defeat in a row as defending champions @entity66 secured a 1 - 0 away victory			1
@entity69 midfielder @entity68 scored the only goal of the match for @entity66 to complete a fine week which saw them progress to the last 16 of the @entity74 on thursday			0

@entity75 ' @entity83 substitute @entity82 struck in injury time to send the defending champions 10 points clear with a game in hand over their nearest rivals			0
@entity79 captain @entity90 was sent off in the second half but they looked set to hold out for a point until @entity82 scored with the last kick of the game			0
in the @entity98 , the battle for third place intensified as nine - man @entity99 lost 4 - 1 at @entity101			1
@entity102 grabbed the opener on 20 minutes but @entity99 defender @entity104 was sent off for deliberate handball and @entity106 converted the penalty kick			0
@entity108 and @entity106 scored further goals for @entity101 after the break before the visitors had @entity112 sent off in the 81st minute and @entity113 added the fourth			0
earlier , @entity114 were held to a goalless draw by @entity116 and trail @entity99 by three points			0

a double from @entity130 @entity129 enabled @entity125 to keep up the pressure on @entity133 's men while third placed as @entity134 saw their title hopes slip away in a 2 - 2 draw at @entity137 , having led 2 - 0 .			1

@entity1 goal gives @entity5 1 - 0 home win over @entity9 to top @entity7
