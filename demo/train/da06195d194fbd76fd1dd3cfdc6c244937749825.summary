ten months ago , @entity0 lay in bed unable to sleep			0
the 42 - year - old single mother of two had a sinus infection , and the pain was making her restless			0
she tried getting comfortable on her left side , then her right , but she ended up staring at the ceiling in complete darkness , her left hand coming to rest on her chest			0
it was at that moment her fingers brushed a tiny knob under her skin			0
" i felt a rock - hard lump next to my nipple , " @entity0 recalls			0
" i just knew at that moment i had cancer			2
" @entity0 did have cancer			2
and while her breast surgeon assured her the tumor was isolated to her right breast , and she knew she had no family history of the disease , @entity0 opted for a double mastectomy			2
" it was important to me to remove both breasts , " she says			0
" i knew that if i kept my other breast , i would obsess over it , and i 'd always worry that cancer would develop there , too			2
" researchers are paying close attention to the increasing rate of double mastectomies in the @entity37			1
the number of women with early stage breast cancer who went on to remove both breasts ( even though only one breast had cancer ) increased by more than 150 % between 1998 and 2003 , according to a study presented by dr. @entity46 at the annual conference for the @entity48			1
since that meeting , @entity46 has continued crunching the numbers			0
in unpublished reports released to @entity53 , 8 % of patients sought prophylactic removal of their unaffected breast at @entity56 in @entity57 in 2010			2
the percentage increased to 12.6 % in 2011 , and rose again to 14.1 % in 2012 , according to @entity46 , who is chief of breast surgery at @entity56			1
data from @entity62 's @entity61 echo these numbers			2
the rate for women choosing to remove both breasts when only one has cancer jumped from 6.7 % in 1997 to 24 % in 2005 , according to a 2011 study in the @entity70			1
and from 2005 to 2009 , the latest year data is available , the proportion of women undergoing mastectomies overall also rose , according to @entity75 , a statistician with the @entity76			1
experts say several intersecting factors could be fueling this trend			0
actress @entity80 recovering from double mastectomy access to genetic screening since testing became available in 1996 , nearly 1 million people have been screened for @entity86 and @entity87 , the genetic mutations associated with increasing a woman 's lifetime risk of developing breast cancer as much as 87 % , according to @entity92 , the diagnostic company that helped isolate the two genes and later developed a test to detect them			1
for women who test positive , removing both breasts is seen as a viable , cancer - preventing option -- especially in the @entity37			1
in a global study conducted by dr. @entity100 , senior scientist at @entity101 in @entity102 , the @entity37 had the highest rate of prophylactic mastectomy in @entity86 and @entity87 mutation carriers			1
the @entity37 rate was 36.3 % , far outpacing the number of preventive surgeries performed by the majority of other countries @entity100 studied , including @entity111 and @entity112			1
one reason for the spike may be that @entity37 women fear cancer more than women in other regions			1
about 70 % of women in the @entity37 who have both breasts removed after a cancer diagnosis do n't have a proven medical reason for undergoing the procedure , according to a 2012 study conducted by the @entity125			1
" the dilemma we 're facing is more and more women are choosing to remove both breasts , " said dr. @entity126 , associate professor of surgery at the @entity128 , in a statement announcing the findings			1
" we 're greatly overestimating the risk of women with breast cancer developing another breast cancer			1
" however , authors of the study indicate that a double mastectomy may make sense for women with a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer , or for women who 've tested positive for genetic mutations in the brca genes			1
dr. @entity150 , executive director of the @entity151 for brca at the @entity152 , said the escalating rate is linked to easy access of information			2
" the data we 've been collecting is evolving quickly , and these women are living with this information in real time , " she said in an e-mail			2
" since 1994 enormous progress had occurred : ( @entity162 ) he genes have been cloned , clinically available tests for gene mutations have been developed , and the implications of having @entity86 / 2 mutations are better understood			0
women as young as 25 are using this data to make informed choices			2
" @entity172 opens up on double mastectomy advances in plastic surgery women today have access to breast reconstruction options that were unavailable to their mothers and grandmothers			1
doctors are increasingly avoiding the use of implants by taking fat from a patient 's stomach , upper back , buttock or thigh to construct and shape new breasts			2
if a woman decides to go with implants , they 've been made safer and more comfortable , and surgeons increasingly offer immediate implant reconstruction instead of the traditional multistep process that took months of additional doctor visits			0
cosmetic outcomes have never been better , said dr. @entity197 , chief of plastic surgery at @entity199 in @entity62 and past president of the @entity201			1
" it 's hard to believe that implants have only been widely available since the 1970s			0
before then , and it 's really not that long ago , women were subjected to wearing falsies			1
the options available today have dramatically improved the way a woman looks after surgery			1
and with even better microsurgery options on the way , i imagine we 'll see even higher numbers of women choosing mastectomy			1
" one such technique , if put into commercial practice , may raise ethical red flags			0
according to @entity197 , doctors are working on a new procedure that would one day make it possible for individuals to donate their excess fat -- similar to the way blood is donated today -- so women seeking a more natural breast reconstruction could take advantage of somebody else 's flesh			2
" the possibility is being explored with our regenerative medicine task force , and it 's very exciting , " he said			0
" if we can figure out how a patient 's body wo n't reject the tissue , i think we 'll see even more women choosing preventative mastectomy down the line			1
" why a cancer - free beauty queen wants mastectomy ' @entity245 ' culture a growing awareness of breast cancer survivorship makes undergoing mastectomy not as foreign or frightening as perhaps it once was			1
an online search shows a seemingly limitless number of breast cancer support groups , with a growing collection dedicated to women considering preventive surgery			1
dr. @entity255 , chief of the division of plastic and reconstructive surgery at @entity260 's / @entity259 and @entity261 in @entity62 , said he 's seen a 20 % increase in five years of high - risk , yet cancer - free women coming to his office seeking mastectomies			1
these patients often arrive telling him what kind of surgery they want because they 've read about certain procedures online , and in many cases , they 've viewed hundreds of before - and - after photos as well			0
in addition , surgeons are marketing themselves directly to information - hungry patients online			0
doctors are holding @entity279 chats and creating websites to promote their services			0
at the @entity283 , a breast surgeon has even launched an online guide to help women decide if preventive surgery is right for them			2
dr. @entity287 , a board member at the @entity288 and @entity0 's breast surgeon in @entity290 , was heading into two back - to - back surgeries last month when she spoke			0
one of her patients , just like @entity0 , had cancer in one breast and not the other			0
" this is the @entity37 culture , " she said			0
" we want quick solutions , and we expect there 's an answer to every problem			0
in many cases these women do n't need double mastectomies , but my job is to listen , make sure they have all the information and give them what makes sense and puts them most at ease			1
" which is certainly the case for @entity0			0
" i chose to remove both breasts , even though i 'm sure some would say it was a hysterical choice , " she said			0
" i do n't have @entity86 or @entity87 , but i do have two daughters			0
i wanted to do whatever i could to be around for them as long as possible			0

study : rate of women with early stage cancer choosing double mastectomies rose 150 %
availability of genetic testing , better plastic surgery options may be behind the increase
" @entity245 " culture also may be spreading awareness about women 's survival options
