-- and then there were two			0
sunday 's showpiece @entity3 final in the @entity6 capital @entity7 pits holders @entity8 against @entity10 , between them the winners of the last two @entity13			1
@entity8 are on the brink of creating soccer history ; never before has a country won three major international football tournaments in a row and the @entity19 , who won @entity21 and the @entity22 , now have the chance to earn a place in the record books			1
before the @entity29 , former @entity27 and @entity28 striker @entity26 said " @entity8 " were just one trophy away from greatness			1
" if they won three tournaments in a row , something no other team has done , you would have to put them up there among the all - time greatest teams , " said @entity26 , who helped @entity28 reach the @entity33 semifinals in 1990			1
@entity8 reach @entity3 2012 final after shootout victory @entity45 's side enjoyed huge good fortune in wednesday 's semifinal against @entity49 neighbors @entity50 , winning 4 - 2 in a penalty shootout after a 0 - 0 draw , with @entity53 scuffing the decisive spot - kick as it hit the inside of the post and rolled along the goalline before creeping into @entity59 's net			1
@entity61 ' penalty can perhaps be seen as a symbol of @entity8 's unconvincing performances at @entity64 so far , which have left a large proportion of the watching public unsatisfied as they struggled to break down packed opposition defenses			1
the end of a love affair ? for all their possession ( @entity8 have enjoyed around 67 % of the ball in their five matches ) , there has been frustration that they have neither moved the ball around quickly enough nor created enough goalscoring chances , instead wearing the other team down by making their players chase shadows before waiting for a mistake			2
whisper it quietly , but some have even labeled @entity8 's previously much - feted tiki - taka style of play " boring " and claimed it is currently a more defensive tactic than offensive -- an argument perhaps backed up by the fact that @entity8 have now not conceded a knockout - stage goal in any tournament since the 2006 @entity33 , a run of nine matches and a remarkable 900 minutes of action			1
against @entity10 in the group stage and @entity99 in the last eight , @entity45 even picked a starting @entity101 without a single striker -- a tactic designed to help @entity8 keep the ball better and lure the opposing defense out so they could get in behind			1
it has n't worked flawlessly , but they have churned out results regardless			0
beautiful football might be what people demand , but results are what @entity45 deals in first ; since taking over from previous coach @entity117 following @entity21 , the 61 - year - old has led the national team to an incredible 50 wins from 59 matches			0
midfielder @entity121 , who scored the winner in the 2010 @entity33 final , says @entity8 are n't bothered by the " boring " tag			1
the 27 - year - old instead focuses on the positives of their possession - based game			0
" when a team wants to attack and comes up against an opponent that sits back and tries to close the space and not try to create its own chances , that 's not always the football you want to watch , " said @entity121			2
" it 's easy to forget that only a few years ago this style is what changed the story of @entity8			1
" a change in mentality it is a story that began at @entity21 -- and really , truly began with @entity8 's quarterfinal penalty shootout victory over @entity10 in @entity145 , a match that defender @entity147 looks back on as the turning point			1
" i think it changed the mentality of the national team , " said the @entity27 star			0
" before , @entity8 played to avoid losing -- but afterwards they played to win			1
" @entity10 were the @entity33 champions at the time and favorites to go through , but it is perhaps not as well remembered that they were missing the suspended @entity160 , who has been in such glorious form at this tournament			1
@entity160 , let 's not forget , was also injured at the @entity22 and played only 34 minutes in their final group game game as @entity10 crashed out at the first hurdle following draws with @entity167 and @entity168 and a 3 - 2 defeat at the hands of @entity171			1
but the 33 - year - old midfielder is enjoying a stunning renaissance in his career			0
a year ago he was discarded by @entity175 after 10 years of service , but signed for @entity177 and led " @entity185 " to the @entity179 league title before showcasing the full range of his majestic talents for the world to see in @entity184 and @entity6			0
if @entity10 were besieged by the storm of another match - fixing scandal in their domestic game brewing prior to @entity64 , @entity160 provided the steady hand on the tiller to sail the ship into calmer waters			1
with hardly a hair out of place and rarely breaking into a sweat , the masterful @entity160 has dictated the knockout matches against @entity28 and @entity198 with breathtaking class , providing an exhibition in how to create space and pass the ball both of the long and short variety			0
the master and the maverick when looking long , @entity160 has often sought out @entity206 , the maverick @entity207 striker who is as well - known for his controversial lifestyle away from football as his performances on the pitch -- something which may change after his monumental two - goal showing against the much - fancied @entity214 in the semifinal			0
@entity206 double sends @entity10 through to @entity64 final @entity206 went into @entity64 considered a talented liability , as capable of moments of madness as those of brilliance , but he powered home a header to give @entity10 the lead and then crashed a stunning second into the top corner from 18 yards			1
even @entity198 keeper @entity228 had to applaud the 21 - year - old 's chutzpah			2
" tonight was the most beautiful of my life -- but i hope that this sunday is even better , " said @entity206 in the aftermath			2
" along with @entity8 , we are the two best teams in the tournament			2
we are the only side to have scored against @entity8 so far			2
we proved that we are equal to them , if not more , and we want to win			2
" whoever wins on sunday , it will provide a fairytale finish to a competition that has surpassed all expectations			0
scare stories the buildup to the first major football tournament behind the old @entity245 in eastern @entity246 was dominated by scare stories : the transport infrastructure was n't ready ; there were n't enough ( affordable ) hotels for supporters to stay in ; racism was a widespread problem in both host countries ; foreign fans would not be welcomed in many of the host cities , and so on			0
yet most of the fears have been unfounded			0
yes , there have been issues with supporters that @entity246 football 's governing body @entity263 has had to deal with , and member associations have been fined for specific incidents of failing to keep their fans under control			0
some of the magnificent stadia have not been full for every game , but that is probably down to the fact that @entity246 is going through difficult economic times right now and @entity184 and @entity6 are further away than most host nations have been , resulting in increased traveling costs			0
but by and large , @entity64 has been an unqualified success			2
the group stage matches were full of attacking intent and fine goals and the knockout stages have produced two penalty shootouts of unbearable tension , not to mention @entity10 's awesome destruction of @entity198			1
referees have let games flow and kept the card count down , and the players have responded by concentrating more on their football and less on feigning injury and trying to artificially gain their team an advantage			0
everywhere you looked , there was a story : @entity294 gave the @entity6 people a memory they will never forget with two goals to see off @entity298 ; @entity299 put their country 's vast financial problems aside to qualify from @entity302 ; the much - fancied @entity303 went back home with tails between legs ; and then there was @entity8 and @entity10 , quietly working their way through the tournament			1
sensational scoring with 30 of the 31 matches played we have seen only three red cards -- two of which came in the opening game as @entity184 drew with @entity299 -- and there have been 21 goals scored from headers , which at 29 % of the total 72 stands way higher than at any previous euros			0
wonderful goals have crashed in with regularity , from the acrobatics of @entity324 and @entity206 to the gorgeous flick of @entity326 , the emphatic volleys of @entity328 and @entity329 to the unstoppable rocket shots of @entity331 and , again , @entity206			0
and then there was @entity160 's " @entity333			0
" with @entity28 leading @entity10 2 - 1 after the first two penalties in sunday 's quarterfinal shootout , @entity160 produced a moment of genius to change the momentum entirely in @entity10 's favor			1
he watched the @entity28 keeper buzz around on the line trying to put him off , before coolly chipping the ball -- a la @entity333 in the 1976 @entity3 final shootout -- delicately into the net after @entity345 had dived early and erroneously to his right			0
@entity28 missed their next two penalties and @entity10 triumphed			2
" @entity345 seemed to be very confident in himself			0
i needed to do something to beat him and it seemed to be a psychological blow , " said the unflappable @entity160			0
@entity28 boss @entity352 added : " the cool , calculated way @entity160 chipped it , that is something you either have or you do n't have as a player			0
" the watching football world swooned , and @entity160 produced his second successive man - of - the - match display to help @entity10 slay @entity198 in the semis and continue the @entity10 's amazing record of never having lost a competitive game to " @entity198			1
" on sunday , @entity363 's team can keep another record intact : that of a country never winning three major international tournaments in a row			1
@entity8 are potentially 90 minutes away from sporting immortality			2
a captivating conclusion to @entity64 lies in wait .			2

holders @entity8 to meet @entity10 in sunday 's @entity64 final in @entity7
@entity8 aiming to become first nation to win three successive major tournaments
@entity10 looking for first @entity29 triumph since 1968 , but won @entity33 in 2006
@entity8 's dominance and style has been labeled " boring " by some *critics*
