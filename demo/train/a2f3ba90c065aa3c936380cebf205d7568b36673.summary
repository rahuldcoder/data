" if this buildup and bombing campaign is n't countered aggressively by the international community , it appears likely that @entity0 's actions will plunge @entity1 even more deeply into internal war as well as ignite a full - scale war with @entity1			1

" the camp houses about 20,000 refugees who have fled the violence in the states of @entity41 and @entity29			0
@entity41 , @entity29 and the @entity104 straddle @entity1 and @entity1 's ethnic and political lines			2
