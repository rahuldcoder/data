@entity0 -- a billboard has sparked controversy in @entity0 after an anti-abortion group erected a sign focused exclusively on @entity7 abortion rates			1
the sign -- which was paid for by an organization called @entity9 -- reads : " the most dangerous place for an @entity7 is in the womb			1
" the billboard -- located roughly a half mile from a @entity13 facility in @entity16 's @entity15 neighborhood -- features an african - american girl			1
" they 're attacking women for choosing abortion while simultaneously destroying family planning , " said spokeswoman @entity18 for the @entity0 - based @entity19			1
" their hypocrisy is as large and as obnoxious as this billboard			2
" but pastor @entity26 , a @entity9 board member , told reporters at a press conference on wednesday that " it 's hard to celebrate @entity30 " with abortion " hanging over our community			2
" " abortion is out - pacing life in our community " and he said the billboard 's message is meant to be a " provocative " way to illustrate the problem			1
african - americans tend to have high abortion rates when compared to other demographic groups , according to @entity44 , a spokeswoman for the @entity45 , a @entity0 - based research center for sexual and reproductive health			1
the disparity is in part attributed to a " lack of adequate services " in many black communities , which " has resulted in more unintended pregnancies , " @entity44 said			0
according to the @entity9 website , the move is an attempt " to raise public awareness of life issues through advertising and raise truths about life issues to educate and empower individuals			0
" the sign is part of a national campaign where more billboards will appear over the next couple of months across the country , @entity9 spokeswoman @entity62 said			0
critics say the message is misleading			0
" the issue is here they are doing a campaign , targeting one group of women and making them feel guilty and shameful about family choices that they are making , " @entity18 said			0
" you ca n't take a woman and lift her out of her experience			0
" but rev. @entity81 , another @entity9 board member , told reporters something needs to be done about abortion in the black community and this is " calling attention to a dramatic event			2
" " this is a truth and tragedy , " he said			0
@entity26 said " the child ( in the billboard ) was selected for her innocence			2
