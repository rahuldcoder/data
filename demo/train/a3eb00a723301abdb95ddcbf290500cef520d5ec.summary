-- it was supposed to be the start of motorsport 's elite competition for 2013 , but the stars of @entity6 were left skidding about the rain - lashed @entity8 track like novice drivers			1
saturday 's qualifying was curtailed after the opening session , meaning the other two will now be held just a few hours ahead of the season - opening @entity14 @entity13			1
the last time qualifying has been so badly affected was at @entity16 in @entity17 in 2010 , when all three sessions were moved to sunday			1
" for us drivers , it means we have to build ourselves up for the challenge of qualifying again and again -- a bit like asking @entity27 to get ready for five 100 - meter sprints one after the other and aborting four of them , " said @entity20 's @entity19 , who won at @entity21 last year			1
" that level of disruption creates quite a lot of mental and psychological stress for any athlete , but it was even worse for the fans , who 'd been waiting excitedly for qualifying all day long and who then had to sit in the pouring rain with no on - track action to entertain them			0
" explore @entity8 circuit with @entity0 's @entity6 interactive there were still plenty of incidents as @entity46 spun and hit a wall , losing a front wing from his @entity49			2
a similar fate befell @entity57 rookie @entity56 , his teammate @entity50 and @entity52 's newcomer @entity51 , who went over a curb with his rear wheel			0
the @entity58 missed out on the second stage of qualifying along with the @entity57 duo , @entity63 rookies @entity64 and @entity65 , plus pastor @entity66 -- a race winner last year -- who also went off - road and later described his @entity68 as " undriveable			1
" @entity70 ' @entity69 set the quickest time of one minute 43.380 seconds -- a second slower than triple world champion @entity73 's fastest efforts from friday practice as none of the drivers had the chance to use @entity79 's new supersoft compound tires due to the wet conditions			1
@entity69 's new teammate @entity81 was back in 10th , as the 2008 world champion managed to complete the session despite hitting a barrier -- extricating himself from the grass as he tentatively reversed back onto the track			2
last season 's championship runnerup @entity90 was second fastest for @entity49			1
" it 's a shame that qualifying has been put back , " the two - time world champion said , " but it was the right decision given the track conditions , especially as the white lines were really too slippery			2
" @entity46 was happy to finish sixth , ahead of @entity73 and @entity19 but behind @entity97 's @entity96 , fourth - placed @entity98 of @entity20 and third - placed @entity99 of @entity100			0
" in my whole career , i 've never managed to get back on track after such a heavy impact and i 'm really happy to still be in the hunt for qualifying , " the @entity101 said			0
" other drivers were in similarly risky positions , so i fully approve of the decision taken by the stewards			0
in the dry , we are up there with the best , now we must sort out fixing the damaged parts			0
" @entity99 's teammate @entity114 , third overall last season , was back in 11th ahead of @entity117 's @entity116 -- who like veteran @entity119 also went off the track and into the grass verge			0
" it was n't easy with the traffic , people going off and the yellow flags but we went through to the second qualifying session tomorrow so it 's not all bad , " said 2007 world champion @entity114 .			0
