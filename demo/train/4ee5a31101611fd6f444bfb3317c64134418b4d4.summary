-- in the words of vice president @entity4 , the vice presidency " is n't worth a pitcher of warm piss			1
" vice president @entity6 is best known for shooting and killing @entity7 in a duel in 1804			1
that may be true , but the characters who 've held the job are definitely worth a few good pages of trivia			1
join mental_floss in toasting seven backup plans that made this country great			1
@entity18 : @entity20 's @entity19 @entity18 took office under the thickest cloud of suspicion			1
as a lieutenant in senator @entity25 's political machine , @entity18 held one of the most lucrative positions in government : collector for the port of @entity30			1
for seven years , @entity18 raked in approximately $ 40,000 annually ( about $ 700,000 today ) , running a corrupt spoils system for thousands of payroll employees			1
with so much money and power , @entity18 developed an affinity for fancy clothes and earned the nickname " the @entity38			1
" but his luck did n't last			1
president @entity40 eventually stepped in and fired him from the post			2
even with the kickback scandal and claims that he 'd been born in @entity43 ( which should 've disqualified him for the vice presidency ) , @entity18 still managed to get elected on @entity20 's 1880 ticket			1
after @entity20 passed away 199 days into his presidency , @entity18 did n't hesitate to sign the @entity47			1
much to the chagrin of @entity25 , the @entity47 revamped civil service by effectively killing the same patronage system that made @entity18 very , very rich			1
in cleaning up civil service , @entity18 also cleaned up his reputation , and he exited the @entity53 a hero			1
@entity55 : @entity56 's second @entity19 @entity55 was a dedicated devotee of eastern mysticism			2
while serving as @entity59 secretary of agriculture in the 1930s , he allegedly sent his guru to @entity62 under the pretense of collecting grasses that could withstand drought			2
in reality , @entity55 was diverting funds to help his guru hunt for evidence that @entity70 had visited @entity71			2
but it was n't @entity55 's spiritual beliefs that landed him @entity59 's no. 2 job			2
@entity55 was a big @entity56 fan and supported his entire platform , which is why @entity56 handpicked him as his third - term running mate in 1940			2
@entity55 was n't popular with the @entity77 , but when @entity56 made it clear he would n't run without him , the party acquiesced			2
as vice president , @entity55 made many international goodwill trips			2
most famously , he traveled to the @entity82 , where he experienced a political transformation that resulted in him becoming an avowed @entity82 apologist			2
his communist leanings did nothing for his image , especially once he became secretary of commerce under president @entity89			2
in 1948 , @entity55 unsuccessfully ran for president on the @entity92 ticket , espousing views that sounded shockingly @entity94			2
he even described corporations as " midget @entity96 " attempting to crush the labor class			2
but nobody can say @entity55 did n't know how to own up to his mistakes			2
in 1952 , he recanted his support of the @entity82 in a magazine article called " where i was wrong			2
" by then , however , his political career was over			2
@entity55 spent the rest of his life conducting agricultural experiments on his farm in @entity30			1
@entity108 : @entity109 's @entity19 @entity108 was sworn into office in @entity111 , becoming the only executive officer to take the oath on foreign soil			1
@entity108 had gone to @entity111 to recuperate from tuberculosis and severe alcoholism , but it did n't work			2
he died in 1853 after being vice president for just 25 days			0
that might not be the most memorable thing about @entity108 , though			0
it 's widely rumored that the former @entity19 was homosexual			0
further still , he 's suspected of being @entity123 's lover			0
neither @entity108 nor @entity123 ever married , and they lived together in @entity125 for 15 years before @entity123 became president			0
of course , @entity108 's predilection for wearing scarves and wigs only fanned the rumors			0
president @entity131 used to call him " miss @entity132 , " and @entity133 , a fellow @entity134 , dubbed him " @entity135			0
@entity136 : @entity138 @entity137 's @entity19 despite his credentials as a war hero and a @entity142 senator , vice president @entity136 was never accepted in @entity125			0
perhaps that 's because he dressed like a farmhand , cursed like a sailor , and made no secret of his three black mistresses , who were also his slaves			0
the first mistress bore him two daughters before she passed away ; the second tried to run off with a @entity152 chief , but @entity136 captured and resold her ; and the third was the second one 's sister			0
@entity136 attempted to introduce this third mistress into polite society , but the couple was n't well - received			0
with the support of @entity131 , @entity136 landed the vice presidency under @entity161 in 1836			0
after four years of public relations disasters , @entity131 withdrew his support			0
nonetheless , @entity137 kept @entity136 on his ticket , and the two lost their re-election bid in 1840			0
@entity6 : @entity167 's @entity19 no story on vice presidents would be complete without @entity6 -- best known for shooting and killing @entity7 in a duel in 1804			1
after the incident , @entity6 went back to presiding over the @entity172			1
from there , he plotted a treasonous conspiracy to become emperor of the western @entity59 and @entity176			0
the plan could have worked , but one of @entity6 's co-conspirators ratted him out			1
he was tried in 1807 before the @entity180 , which found him not guilty , mainly because he had n't actually committed the treason yet			1
a free man , @entity6 turned his sights on @entity184			1
he went to @entity185 and tried to convince @entity186 to help him conquer the swampland , but that plan foundered , too			1
although his political high jinks often failed , @entity6 consistently found success with the ladies			1
after his wife died in 1794 , @entity6 remained a bachelor for 40 years , making the acquaintance of several eligible socialites			1
he enjoyed flirtations with @entity198 debutantes , as well as a widow named @entity200 -- later known as @entity200 , wife of @entity201			0
at age 76 , @entity6 married a wealthy widow of ill - repute and plundered her fortune			1
citing numerous infidelities on his part , she filed for divorce and was actually granted it			0
unfortunately for her , it came through on the day @entity6 died			1
@entity212 : @entity213 's 4th @entity19 @entity212 took his 1865 vice-presidential oath drunk as a skunk and belligerent as hell			1
having grown up dirt poor , @entity136 felt the aristocracy in @entity125 had abused his kinfolk			0
glassy - eyed and smelling of whiskey , he reminded @entity222 , the @entity180 , the @entity223 , and pretty much everyone within hearing distance that they owed their positions to " plebeians " such as himself , then kissed the @entity228 and staggered away			0
needless to say , his address was poorly received			0
the @entity231 opined , " to think that one frail life stands between this insolent , clownish creature and the presidency ! may @entity235 bless and spare @entity213 ! " unfortunately , @entity235 did n't			0
the @entity236 surrendered six days before @entity213 's assassination , leaving @entity136 to handle reconstruction -- a job he bungled so completely that @entity222 moved to impeach him			0
incredibly , @entity136 avoided being booted out of office by just one vote			0
@entity242 : @entity123 's @entity19 by all accounts , @entity242 was a @entity142 gentleman in the grandest sense			0
he had an impressive career as a lawyer and a representative in the @entity248			0
more notably , at age 36 , he became the youngest vice president in history			0
but , like @entity6 , things took a turn for @entity254 when he was charged with treason			1
in september 1861 , only a few months after his vice presidential term had ended , @entity256 and @entity258 forces invaded his home state of @entity142			0
@entity254 cast his lot with the @entity262 , and the federal government promptly indicted him			0
@entity242 headed south and became @entity265 ' secretary of war			0
but when the @entity258 surrendered in 1865 , @entity254 was forced to go on the lam			1
he hid for the next two months in @entity267 and @entity184 before escaping to @entity111			1
@entity242 , his wife , and their children spent the next four years in exile , wandering through @entity43 , @entity272 , @entity273 , and the @entity274 , until president @entity212 issued a general @entity275 on @entity277 in 1868			1
the following march , @entity254 returned to the country with his family , but his name was n't officially cleared until 1958 , when a @entity142 circuit court judge dismissed his indictment			0
