-- @entity1 is known for producing some of the world 's greatest runners and now a company wants to get them noticed wearing a brand from their country			1
a group of young entrepreneurs have launched what they say is the nation 's first running brand and they have high hopes of one day transforming @entity13 into the running apparel capital of the world			1
" there are a lot of @entity1 athletes and you always see them wearing @entity24 and @entity25 and not something from their own country , " said @entity16 , who designs the clothing and heads up the @entity1 operation of @entity19			1
" we do have quite a good track record when it comes to running , so why not match that with an equally big clothing brand , " he added			2
@entity33 says it creates running apparel that 's ' designed , manufactured and managed in @entity1 by @entity1			1
' the name of the brand forms the backbone of the company 's ethos			1
" @entity33 is all about having the courage to do new things , try new things , be brave and go out and do what you would not normally do , " @entity16 said			0
the brand officially launched in july producing just over 1,000 t - shirts			1
while initial orders are still low the team plans to eventually make everything from running shorts to hooded sweatshirts once they have more capital			2
but they are quick to point out that they 're not just selling apparel			1
" our shirts are beautiful			0
we use the softest fabric available ; employ a modern fit and fantastic graphics , but what sets us apart are our ideals , " said @entity57 , the brains behind @entity33			0
" by purchasing a @entity64 shirt one is investing in @entity1 's future			1
a future that is built upon business and international trade not foreign aid , " he continued			0
@entity71 growth vision @entity73 - based economics professor and running enthusiast , @entity57 spent years getting @entity75 off the ground			0
he even rode 1,800 miles on his bike from @entity78 to @entity79 to raise the initial start - up funds			0
@entity57 first became interested in the idea of producing an ethical clothing line when he was researching textiles factories in @entity85 as part of his ph.d. " i always wondered why ' ethical ' clothing lines were so focused on concentrating operations in @entity91 or @entity92			2
there are incredible designers and entrepreneurs in impoverished countries , " he said			0
" to create real economic development , an apparel company needs to create as many economic linkages in a poor country as possible , " he continued			1
@entity1 's ' silent crisis ' the @entity103 team pride themselves on being one of the most ethical athletic apparel company in the world , according to @entity57			1
the clothes are produced by @entity108 , a @entity1 - owned and operated factory , employing around 200 people , mostly women			2
the factory makes everything from police uniforms to high - end fashion			0
however , the most important thing @entity57 says is that working conditions are fair and the employees are happy			0
but the small team , who all hold down a variety of other day jobs , dream of one day opening up their own factory and headquarters in @entity13			2
while @entity33 have n't approached any athletes yet , they hope that in 10 to 20 years @entity1 runners in the @entity128 and other major sporting events will be wearing their brand			1
they also have plans to approach smaller youth organizations in the country who have a focus on sports			0
the group says there are n't many @entity1 - based fashion outlets and that most clothing comes from @entity71			2
@entity33 hopes their industry model could help change the face of business in @entity1 by inspiring the younger generation			1
" it shows that you do n't have to go to @entity148 or @entity149 to be successful			0
this could help boost the economy and generate income and jobs , " @entity16 said			0
" we hope the entrepreneurship spirit of @entity64 will show other young talent that if you have the courage and you persevere you can achieve what you want to			0
