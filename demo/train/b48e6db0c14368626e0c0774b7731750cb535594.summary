-- the @entity2 government moved to block the proposed merger of beer giant @entity4 with @entity6 's @entity5 on thursday , with a @entity8 official calling it " a bad deal for @entity2 consumers			1
" @entity12 already owns about half of @entity5 , which brews the popular @entity15 brand			1
the @entity8 's antitrust lawsuit accuses @entity12 of trying to eliminate " a significant competitive threat " from @entity5 's @entity15 brands by purchasing the rest of the @entity6 company for a proposed $ 20.1 billion			1
that deal would boost @entity12 's share of the @entity2 beer market grow from about 39 % to 46 % , the lawsuit states			1
add that to the 29 % already controlled by no. 2 brewer @entity26 , and two companies would split about three - quarters of the $ 80 billion field , said @entity29 , the head of the @entity8 's antitrust division			0
" beer prices have gone up in recent years because of this high concentration , " @entity29 said thursday morning			0
" @entity12 and @entity26 have been able to drive prices up year after year			2
" competition from @entity5 forces the top two players " to forego the full extent of the price increases that they would otherwise be able to get out of the market , " he said			2
opinion : do n't let big brewers win beer wars the effect has been particularly strong in states with large @entity47 populations , like @entity48 and @entity49 , the lawsuit states			0
and the complaint cites company documents that justice says show @entity12 complaining about @entity5 hindering their ability to raise prices			1
so letting the deal go ahead would be " a bad deal for @entity2 consumers , " @entity29 said			1
@entity12 was created by the 2008 merger of the historic @entity61 - based brewer with @entity62 's @entity4 , producer of @entity65 brands like @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 's			2
a company statement called the antitrust suit " inconsistent with the law , the facts and the reality of the marketplace			2
" " we remain confident in our position , and we intend to vigorously contest the @entity8 's action in federal court , " the company said			0
but the lawsuit will mean the deal wo n't be completed by the end of march , it said			0
to avoid antitrust concerns , @entity12 had proposed selling off @entity5 's half - interest in its @entity2 importer			1
but @entity53 argued that would produce only " a facade of competition " while eliminating a " a particularly aggressive competitor " from the market			0
@entity29 said the @entity8 and @entity12 had " frank and candid " discussions with the company over the merger , " but at the end of the day , we were just too far apart			0
