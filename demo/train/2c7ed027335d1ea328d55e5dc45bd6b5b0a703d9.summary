-- in the face of an army of cartoon characters , some @entity2 officials are concerned the public is facing a cuteness overload			1
mascots , known locally as yuru - kyara ( " loose " or " relaxed " characters ) , are ubiquitous in @entity2 , and are used to promote everything from soap , food and train lines , to regions of @entity2 and even prisons			1
they come in every conceivable shape and size , including some downright bizarre creations , and are often conceived of and designed by amateurs , a fact that is often all too apparent			0
but despite the oftentimes amateur nature of some of these beloved characters , it 's safe to say that @entity2 is truly enamored -- or obsessed , to quote one editorial -- with these guys			1
@entity28 of the @entity29 told @entity0 by email that the @entity2 have a long - lasting , deep emotional bond to " non-human " characters , with roots buried deep in an ancient polytheism			1
with these noble antecedents , a generation of cute characters , with names like @entity39 and @entity40 were born			0
and these characters turned out to be perfect for promoting local regions			0
" in an era when local governments are in need , ( many have ) considered a strategy of including emotional warmth and therefore creating ' local characters ' , " @entity28 said			0
" i had noticed that , for selling local products , it is n't possible to increase the name recognition ( if ) there is no ' face ' to the municipality			0
" @entity58 celebrity hence the rise of the regional character , some of whose fame has spread far beyond their territorial boundaries			2
you do n't , for example , need to go to @entity67 to bump into @entity68			0
the @entity2 region 's mascot is a bona fide celebrity throughout the country , and appears on everything from promotional posters advertising his home prefecture and household goods like chopstick holders , to a 100 million - yen ( $ 982,000 ) gold figurine , made by a @entity81 goldsmith			1
@entity68 is the current undisputed king of the mascots , as his @entity84 offerings make clear			2
he 's also the most visual symbol of the character wars that @entity2 's prefectures -- akin to states -- are involved in			1
perhaps surprisingly for the city that was the gritty inspiration for " @entity94 , " @entity2 's second city is as cute - obsessed as the rest of the country , if not more so , with some 45 @entity89 - themed mascots plying their trade in the city			1
but this town might not be big enough for all of them			0
according to the @entity89 's local government , some of the city 's cartoon representatives may be stepping out of the limelight , sidelined in favor of the chosen one , the city 's @entity110 , as @entity89 's " core mascot			2
" " the prefecture has too many mascots , " the @entity113 quoted @entity89 governor @entity114 as saying			1
" people do not know what they are promoting or what policy they are trying to raise awareness of			0
" used sparingly overkill and dilution of brand identity has meant that other stalwarts of the city , such as the kushiyaki - inspired @entity126 , designed to resemble a deep - fried @entity89 delicacy , may soon be surplus to requirements			1
while the plan is not to kill the characters off -- such barbarism is clearly beyond the pale -- they will from now be used only sparingly , if at all			0
instead , the focus is being put on the narrow , bird - like shoulders of @entity137 , who designed in the 1990s to resemble one of the prefecture 's native avian species			2
there are plans to work on the @entity110 brand , perhaps pairing him up with a mrs. @entity137 , and even having the lovebirds produce offspring			0
these characters , officials say , can help promote women 's and childrens ' issues			0
not everybody is in favor of the cull , including the prefecture 's vice governor , who said " respective departments devoted their energy to creating their mascots , and each mascot has been loved by department officials ... i hope such situations will be taken into consideration			2
" however , while there are dissenting voices , the benefits of honing one 's yuru - kyara image to one or two distinctive faces makes sense , especially in modern @entity2 's crowded mascot marketplace .			1

@entity2 prefectures rely *heavily* on their mascots for promotion
an easily recognizable " yuru - kyara " can be *invaluable*
@entity89 looking to cut character dead wood and focus on one yuru - kyara star
