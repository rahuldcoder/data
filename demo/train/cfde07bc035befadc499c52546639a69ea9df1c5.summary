@entity0 , @entity1 -- a political party widely regarded as the liberal option in @entity1 's historic parliamentary elections was leading in early results from weekend polling , according to election officials			1
the @entity9 had about 52 % of the vote across four of the 13 districts where results were released late monday			0
the @entity9 led in three of those -- @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			0
but it trailed the field in @entity19 , where the @entity20 -- led by prominent @entity19 figure @entity21 -- led the pack			0
according to the project on @entity26 , the alliance is a coalition of 58 political parties that has campaigned as a " more liberal , progressive option " in the election , the first in @entity1 in more than four decades			1
the party 's platform focuses heavily on economic issues , according to the project on @entity26			0
the party is led by @entity35 , who was prime minister in the interim government that declared @entity1 a free nation after the 2011 revolt that toppled longtime ruler @entity40 in october			1
the mercurial @entity40 dismantled many of the civic institutions common to democratic states during his 42 years in power , leaving @entity1 struggling to emerge from his shadow			1
about 3,500 candidates were running for 200 seats in a new parliament , and turnout was about 60 % of the country 's 2.8 million registered voters , election commission chairman @entity46 said			2
the results out monday were less than 10 % of the estimated 1.7 million votes cast in the @entity57 country			1
final results are not likely to be announced before the end of the week at the earliest , the state - run @entity59 news agency reported			0
and it will take weeks or even months for the winners to form an effective coalition government , said @entity66 , president of the @entity68 - @entity1 council			2
" the election is providing one thing only : legitimacy , " said @entity66 , who just returned from a visit to @entity1			1
" everything else , all the problems , all the challenges , will still be there the morning after			0
" observers say a new @entity1 state is slowly starting to take shape , but it still could be years -- generations even -- before the revolution will bear fruit			1
@entity84 professor @entity83 said signs that @entity1 is beginning to turn the corner abound			2
" schools and businesses are reopening			0
ministries are being reorganized and are starting to make and implement policy , " said @entity83 , author of " @entity89			0
" " most importantly , the power of the militias is very slowly but inexorably being eroded , " he said			0
the nation 's judiciary is even starting to flex its muscle , @entity83 said , noting that it recently overturned a law that seemed aimed at restricting free expression			0
the parliamentary vote is a litmus test for @entity1 in the @entity102 era			2
@entity103 took place 17 months after political demonstrations against @entity40 broke out in two @entity1 cities			1
those demonstrations spread , leading to a civil war , @entity110 airstrikes and @entity40 's death by a bullet to the head in october			1
while @entity40 's death ended much of the violence , unrest continues in parts of the country , particularly the south and the west , and the government has not been able to completely contain the militias that helped overthrow the former leader			1
but the government has proved capable of responding to such crises , @entity83 said : authorities were able to disarm the militia that took over @entity0 's airport on june 4 , forced attackers out of the prime minister 's office and removed protesters who had blocked access to a state - owned oil company			0
whether the government will be able to forge a long - term solution to the country 's regionally based militias is another matter , said @entity66 , the @entity68 - @entity1 council president			2
" having a central solution to a local problem most of the time does n't work , " he said			0
@entity1 leaders will instead have to work with local councils , who have the power to rein in the militias			1
at the same time , those leaders are likely to face difficulties from mid-level bureaucrats in their own government agencies , many of whom are holdovers from @entity40 's rule			2
work stoppages have not been uncommon , @entity66 said			0
many @entity1 seem ready to put the revolution behind them , @entity83 said , noting an encounter he had with a man whitewashing graffiti on the walls of @entity0 's old city			2
" enough , " @entity83 quoted the man as saying when asked why he was going to the trouble			0
" @entity1 is moving on			2
" the last time @entity1 held an election was almost half a century ago and , for many people , the act of casting a ballot was novel after 42 years of @entity40 's rule			1
ruling has proved similarly unfamiliar , @entity83 said			0
" it would be utterly impossible to construct in only a few months all the institutions of a modern , properly functioning state @entity40 destroyed in his pursuit of statelessness for 42 years , " he said			1
" building a state and a nation takes time , ideas , compromise and leadership -- particularly difficult if , as in @entity1 , the social and political landscape after the civil war was essentially a tabula rasa , and none of those qualities now needed to construct a modern state were in demand during the @entity40 period , " @entity83 said			1
once seated , the new national assembly will be tasked with appointing a transitional government and crafting a constitution			0
@entity187 @entity186 ban ki - moon congratulated the @entity1 people on the election and hailed the electoral staff for " well - conducted and transparent " polling			1
" last year , thousands of @entity1 sacrificed their lives or suffered lasting injury in order to win the right of the @entity1 people to build a new state founded on human dignity and the rule of law , " @entity186 said in a statement sunday			1
" yesterday , their determination was again on display as men and women , young and old , cast their ballots , many with deep emotion , even in some areas where they faced threats to their security			2
" this story is based on reporting by @entity2 's @entity212 in @entity0 and @entity213 and @entity214 in @entity215 .			0
