, the body overseeing the destruction of @entity6 's chemical arsenal			1
since its creation in 1993 , @entity2 has helped eliminate roughly 80 % of world 's declared chemical stockpile -- a remarkable achievement			1
the spotlight on @entity2 underlines the role that science and technology can play in driving groundbreaking diplomatic breakthroughs			1
to be sure , this is not a fundamentally new idea			0
for instance , the @entity18 , last year 's winner of the @entity20 , has used energy research to promote peace and prosperity on the continent since at least 1957 when the @entity26 was signed			2
what is changing rapidly , however , is the potential for scientific diplomacy to move beyond state - to - state contact to a much broader array of actors			0
this is especially true of the science education community , including higher education and research			2
@entity40 , in terms of research output and quality of higher education , is becoming an increasingly key factor in international relations			1
it is now playing a major role in tackling key global challenges , from climate change to conflict resolution			1
indeed , in the case of @entity6 , science will not only help destroy the country 's stockpile of chemical weapons , but also played a major role in providing irrefutable evidence that they were used in the first place			1
remarkably , technology now allows us to detect complex chemicals through satellite measurements in areas where conflict is taking place , in addition to computing the gases that enable these chemicals to be dispersed in the first place			2
to further catalyze the potential of science diplomacy , states should consider endorsing the idea of " science immunity , " an analogy with diplomatic immunity which i know has so much value from my time as an ambassador			1
taking this bold move could lead to the creation of " science diplomatic passports			1
" this would allow properly accredited researchers to circulate more freely , and without political interference , than is often the case due to restrictive work and travel visa regimes			0
this is important for at least two reasons			0
firstly , the decisive breakthroughs in science are increasingly being achieved through international partnership and funding , and we must embrace this			1
take the example of the landmark discovery last year by @entity96 of the @entity98 particle			0
this groundbreaking research , which heralds major progress toward the development of the world 's first quantum computer , was the result of a collaborative effort by a @entity107 phd student and a @entity109 colleague			1
in today 's world , national borders are becoming irrelevant			1
such partnerships are the norm			0
the second inter-related reason why the scientific passport could be so important is the sea - change in the geographical map of science			1
the pioneering work of the @entity120 underlines this vividly			0
in 1973 , about two thirds of the nearly 400,000 academic research publications indexed by @entity120 came from the @entity125 countries			0
today , four times as many documents ( around 1.75 million journal publications ) are being indexed , and half originate from outside the @entity125			0
what this underlines is the growing diffusion of knowledge which could be a massive driver of global economic prosperity in coming decades			0
in classical economic growth theory , factors such as population growth and age composition , alongside presence of arable land and raw materials , are long term determinants of economic growth patterns			0
recent economic history , however , shows that investment levels in science , through research and development and higher education , are highly relevant in explaining emerging growth patterns -- and , therefore , influential in shaping patterns of international relations too			1
somewhat provocatively the argument could be developed further by the following : whereas @entity155 stated that war is the continuation of politics / diplomacy with military means , one could say that science is continuation of politics / diplomacy with ( often ) more academic intellect			0
therefore science is , or at least should be , increasingly at the center of diplomacy as an objective as well as an instrument			2
in practice , science can help diplomacy through the establishment of working relations and exchanges between states , and development of the growing global store of knowledge , with a continuous quest for research breakthroughs			2
equally , diplomacy can help science in connecting people , creating access and promoting big science infrastructure			2
taken overall , it is clear that science , research and higher education are key to our shared future and prosperity			2
we must now unleash its full potential to address the growing range of global challenges humanity will face in the coming decades			0
the opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of @entity200 .			0

@entity2 's *eradication* of 80 % of chemical weapons show growing role of science in world *affairs*
@entity40 now playing major role in tackling key issues from climate change to conflict resolution
@entity213 : " science diplomatic passports " could allow *unfettered* access for researchers
@entity213 : @entity40 should be at center of international diplomatic efforts
