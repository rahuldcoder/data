-- the @entity2 prosecutor handling accusations of crimes against humanity against four prominent @entity6 -- including the country 's newly elected president -- dropped charges monday against one of the men , citing dead , fearful or tainted witnesses and government stonewalling			1
prosecutor @entity14 said the decision to drop charges against former cabinet secretary @entity17 in connection with post-election violence in 2007 had nothing to do with last week 's election of @entity22 as @entity6 's next president			1
" my decision today is based only on the specific facts of the case against mr. @entity17 , and not on any other consideration , " @entity14 said in a statement posted to the court 's website			1
" while we are all aware of political developments in @entity6 , these have no influence , at all , on the decisions that i make as prosecutor of the @entity2			1
" instead , @entity14 said investigators had run up against myriad problems pursuing the case , including witnesses who had died and others who were too afraid to testify			2
the @entity6 government failed to help and prosecutors also had to drop a key witness who recanted some evidence and acknowledged taking bribes , @entity14 said			1
last year , @entity2 judges found probable cause to pursue charges against @entity17 , @entity22 and two others of being " indirect co-perpetrators " in the 2007 violence following a disputed presidential election			1
according to the @entity2 , @entity22 , @entity17 and the others directed a wave of mostly ethnic violence in january 2008			1
the violence followed the 2007 elections in which the incumbent president was declared the winner despite widespread allegations of vote fraud			2
as many as 1,220 people died and more than 350,000 people were displaced by the violence , according to the @entity2			0
prosecutors accused @entity17 of making connections , providing funding and using intermediaries to mobilize attackers			0
@entity22 , prosecutors say , provided " institutional support " for the violence			2
it 's unclear what impact the decision to drop charges against @entity17 could have on the case against the remaining three defendants			2
but a source close to the situation at @entity81 , @entity82 , said the decision could have a " snowball effect " that could lead to the dismissal of all the charges			0
" there 's more evidence , but not much more , " the source said			0
" this case is not a done deal			0
" @entity2 officials did not immediately respond monday to @entity0 requests to comment on the source 's allegations			0
@entity22 , who like the others charged has said he is innocent , has asked the court to reconsider whether the charges are valid , citing a lack of eyewitness evidence , according to court filings			1
@entity100 reported from @entity101 , @entity102 reported and wrote from @entity103			0
@entity0 's @entity104 also contributed to this report .			0

charges remain for @entity6 's newly elected president , @entity22
