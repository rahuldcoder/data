@entity1 's environment minister has conceded that years of neglect have contributed to a devastating drop in coral coverage on the @entity5 along the country 's north eastern coast			1
a report out tuesday sounded what @entity9 referred to as an " alarm bell " on the state of the reef , designated as a @entity14 and home up to 3,000 individual reefs and thousands of species of fish and mollusk			1
" there 's no doubt there 's been a level of neglect for decades which if it had been dealt with otherwise we 'd be in a much better situation now , " @entity9 told the @entity20			0
the report , by the @entity29 ( @entity30 ) and the @entity31 , revealed that the reef had lost half its coral cover in the last 27 years			1
published in the @entity34 , the report warned that if current trends continue , that coverage could halve again by 2022			2
" without intervention , the @entity5 may lose the biodiversity and ecological integrity for which it was listed as a @entity14 , " it said			2
scientists : to save @entity5 , kill starfish researchers say most of the damage was wrought in recent years by a succession of powerful cyclones			1
waves crash down shallow reefs , dislodging pieces of coral that smash against others as they 're thrown around by wind - whipped waters			2
" an area that has been exposed to the eye of the cyclone can look like a rubble zone shortly after it 's passed over			0
it can be really quite devastating , " said @entity57 , a research director with @entity30			0
" it 's been clearly shown from a number of studies that reefs that have been damaged by cyclones and other conditions can make a reasonably good recovery after 10 to 20 years , " he said			2
" the reef has the ability to regenerate from these impacts ; we just need to make sure all the conditions are right for that to happen			2
" the problem on the @entity5 , the report says , is that it 's facing other threats that are hindering its ability to recover			1
run - off from agricultural industry along the @entity79 coast has created fertile conditions for the crown - of - thorns starfish , or @entity82			1
while the report attributed 48 % of the coral loss to cyclones , 42 % was blamed on the starfish , a native species which feeds on coral			1
another 10 % was attributed to coral bleaching , which occurs when water becomes too warm			1
" the recent frequency and intensity of mass coral bleaching are of major concern and are directly attributable to rising atmospheric greenhouse gases			1
to date , the @entity5 has lost fewer corals to bleaching and diseases than many other regions in the world , but bleaching mortality will almost certainly increase in the @entity5 , given the upward trend in temperatures , " the report warned			1
" we ca n't change the weather so storms and bleaching are something that will take a much more concerted action at an international level , however we may be able to do something about crown - of - thorns , either through direct action on the outbreaking populations or by doing things like improving water quality , which has been shown to have a link to causing outbreaks in the first place , " @entity57 said			1
according to researchers at @entity121 , there have been three major outbreaks of @entity82 since the 1960s and it 's believed the start of another one is under way			0
" if the current wave moves in a similar way we can expect starfish populations to progress throughout the central @entity5 over the next 10 years or so , " wrote @entity128 , a senior principal research officer at @entity121 on @entity130 website in april			2
the current method of dealing with the outbreaks involves divers individually injecting the starfish with poison to kill them off one by one , an approach that researchers concede does not work over large areas			0
" it has been shown in other countries that on a large scale attempting to save a reef system over hundreds of kilometers , there are just too many starfish once they 're in full outbreaking mode for it to be economically effective , " @entity57 said			0
instead , research is underway to find new methods to halt their march			0
scientists are investigating the possibility of inducing a natural disease in starfish " by injecting them with a nutrient broth that encourages a naturally - occurring pathogenic bacteria , " @entity57 said			0
however he conceded the theory needs much more work before it was a realistic option			0
another alternative would be to lure the starfish away from certain areas			0
" we know that they respond to chemical cues , it may be possible to use those chemical cues to trap starfish or to move them away from areas of particular sensitivity , " he said			0
five years ago , the federal government introduced its @entity175 , $ 200 million program to reduce run - off from cattle grazing and sugarcane farms , which the environment minister said had a " huge impact			1
" " we 've been upgrading their equipment and upgrading their technology and having a massive difference to the impact of how much chemical is going into the ground , and how much runoff as a result , is then going into the reef , " @entity9 told the @entity20			0
the @entity193 ( @entity193 ) is urging the @entity1 government to commit even more money -- half a billion dollars over seven years -- to allow the government to meet its own targets of completely eliminating fertilizer run - off by 2020			1
" while these findings are deeply disturbing , with the right political will we can stop the march of crown - of - thorns starfish in its tracks and save the reef , " said @entity193 - @entity1 spokesperson @entity199 in a statement			1
" sixty thousand jobs in the tourism industry depend on us acting with urgency over the next few years , " he added			0
the government has said that it 's already started work on many of the recommendations contained in the report , and that its findings reinforce the need for action			0
" just as the economics of it are real , it 's also true that even if the economics were n't there , we have in the @entity5 one of the standout assets for the planet and there 's massive economic consequences associated with it , " @entity9 said			2
" but before you even get to that there 's a responsibility that we have in managing it well and this report is a wake up call to anybody who thought we could just let things go as they were , " he added .			0

@entity1 environment minister says report rings alarm bell for @entity5
report says half the reef 's coral coverage has *disappeared* in the last 27 years
factors blamed *include* cyclones , coral bleaching and the crown - of - thorns starfish
starfish outbreaks hinder reef 's ability to recover from cyclones
