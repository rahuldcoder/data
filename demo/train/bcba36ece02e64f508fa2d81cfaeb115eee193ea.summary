-- buying a home video game console may soon become a lot more like buying a cell phone , according to a new report suggesting @entity5 is planning to offer a subsidized , $ 99 bundle including a @entity7 and @entity9 sensor to anyone who commits to two years of a new , $ 15 monthly online service package			1
according to a report from @entity14 , which cites unnamed sources , the new subsidized bundle will be available " as early as next week " in @entity5 's retail stores			1
the $ 15 monthly subscription would reportedly include all the online game play features of a current @entity20 subscription , alongside unspecified additional content from cable or live sports video providers			2
such a new content plan could help position the @entity7 much more directly as a full - service living room entertainment center , rather than primarily as a video game system			1
that 's a transition @entity5 has been signaling for years with its slow accumulation of online entertainment apps , and one that seems somewhat natural given that entertainment apps are already more popular than online gaming on the @entity32			0
the report also fits with a recent leak that suggested @entity5 would be rolling out a " strategy to further monetize ( the ) @entity7 subscriber base " in time for the holiday season			2
the total two - year cost for the subsidized bundle as described comes in at $ 459 , compared to the $ 418 @entity5 currently charges for a @entity7 and @entity9 bundle ( $ 299 ) and two years of @entity20 ( $ 59/year )			1
whether that extra cost would be worthwhile depends largely on the precise features @entity5 offers for the new monthly subscribers , and how comfortable consumers are with being essentially locked to their game system for a two - year period ( @entity5 would reportedly mimic cell phone providers in charging an early termination fee to those who decide to drop out before the term is up )			0
economical or not , such a move would represent a major change in the way game consoles are presented to consumers			0
rather than offering hardware as a loss - leader for the eventual sale of games and accessories , @entity5 would essentially be subsidizing @entity32 sales to attract the potentially much more lucrative flow of monthly video subscription revenue			0
given the relative sizes of the current markets for console games versus video services , that might not be such a crazy idea			0

report : @entity5 will offer $ 99 @entity9 with $ 15 per month online service charge
the move could position @entity7 as the center of living room entertainment
@entity77 has not *confirmed* the report , which comes from @entity14
