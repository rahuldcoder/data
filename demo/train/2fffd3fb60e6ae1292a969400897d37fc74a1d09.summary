@entity0 -- president @entity2 began working monday night on the speech he will deliver during a memorial service wednesday for the victims of saturday 's mass shooting in @entity7 , @entity8			1
@entity10 officials say @entity2 has determined the broad idea of what he wants to say and is working with his team of speechwriters on drafting his remarks			2
according to one @entity10 official , the president will likely continue tweaking the speech throughout the day before his scheduled wednesday evening remarks			1
while the details , tone and length of the speech have not been released , @entity2 " will devote most of his remarks to memorializing the victims , " a @entity10 official said			1
" as president of the @entity26 , but also as a father , obviously i 'm spending a lot of time just thinking about the families and reaching out to them , " @entity2 said monday			1
@entity2 will also meet with family members of victims in @entity7 , according to a @entity10 official			2
the official said details are still being worked out on how many families he will meet with and where			0
like many presidents before him , @entity2 is thrust into the position of " mourner - in - chief " in the face of a national tragedy			1
president @entity42 was the voice of a nation grieving after the explosion of the space shuttle challenger in 1986			1
" we will never forget them , nor the last time we saw them , this morning , as they prepared for the journey and waved goodbye and ' slipped the surly bonds of earth ' to ' touch the face of @entity56 , ' " @entity42 said from the @entity49			2
president @entity58 's remarks following the @entity60 , @entity61 , bombing in 1995 were widely praised and were described by many as a defining moment in his presidency			1
" let us let our own children know that we will stand against the forces of fear , " @entity58 said at the nationally televised memorial service in @entity60			1
" when there is talk of hatred , let us stand up and talk against it			0
when there is talk of violence , let us stand up and talk against it			0
in the face of death , let us honor life			0
" from his impromptu remarks and rallying cry atop of mound of rubble at ground zero in @entity86 to his memorable speech at @entity0 's @entity88 , president @entity80 faced a similar task of bringing the country together in the aftermath of the attacks of september 11 , 2001			1
" it is said that adversity introduces us to ourselves			0
this is true of a nation as well , " @entity80 said			2
" in this trial , we have been reminded , and the world has seen , that our fellow @entity26 are generous and kind , resourceful and brave , " he said			0
this will not be @entity2 's first time in this unfortunate territory : he spoke after the @entity104 coal mine tragedy in april 2010 and the shooting at @entity106 in @entity107 , in which 13 people were killed , in november 2009			1
" it may be hard to comprehend the twisted logic that led to this tragedy			0
but this much we do know -- no faith justifies these murderous and craven acts , " @entity2 said during the @entity106 memorial service			1
as is always the case , the big challenge is striking the right tone , said presidential scholar @entity119			0
" he has to give a lovely , passionate memorial statement , a eulogy of grief , of hope perhaps for the future , said @entity119 , a former adviser to presidents @entity125 and @entity126			2
" but it 's not a political speech and it has to be carefully stated it 's not a political speech			2
" it 's always a fine line like this			0
if he chooses to step over the line and talk about things that subsequently can be dissected as political ... then he 's made a mistake and he 's done a disservice , " @entity119 said			0
" but that , i think , is unlikely to happen , " @entity119 said			0
@entity1 's @entity140 contributed to this report .			0
