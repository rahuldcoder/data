-- press groups , prominent journalists and administration critics have all accused president @entity4 of failing to live up to his commitment to have the " most transparent administration in history			1
" to some , that pledge is now a punch line			0
but the commitment endures , newly appointed @entity12 press secretary @entity11 said in an interview on @entity0 's " @entity14 " on sunday			1
@entity11 , who was a deputy press secretary before his promotion in june , cited " a number of steps that we 've taken to give people greater insight into what 's happening at the @entity12			1
" there is built - in tension in the relationship between the president and the press , @entity11 said : " if there 's ever a day when the @entity12 press corps sits back and says , ' you know , we 're getting all the information that we need from the @entity31 , ' then everybody in the @entity12 press corps would not be doing their jobs , right ? " @entity11 said he had seen the letter to @entity4 signed by more than 40 news media organizations , including the @entity38 and @entity39 , urging the president and his federal agencies to be more transparent -- to " stop the spin and let the sunshine in			1
" but when asked whether the groups had legitimate concerns , he referred back to the omnipresent tension between the two sides			2
as the new press secretary , @entity11 said he has a responsibility to " try to help the president live up to his commitment to be the most transparent president in history			1
" in spite of aggressive prosecutions of whistleblowers and other actions , he said that he thought the administration had lived up to it so far -- " absolutely " -- and pointed to the quarterly release of @entity12 visitor records and reporters ' access to presidential fundraisers at private homes			1
@entity11 , 39 , is @entity4 's third press secretary , following in the footsteps of @entity67 and @entity68			1
he said he 'd learned a lot from watching his predecessors ' briefings and now tries to " draw on some of the more effective things that they did " during his briefings			0
@entity11 described himself as a voracious consumer of media , thanks partly to the @entity12 press clippings service and partly to his @entity79			1
he plugged the @entity81 ipad app , and also @entity82 , which he said is the first channel he probably checks when he turns on the television			0
for work purposes , " i definitely spend some time on @entity0 , " he said , calling it " a pretty good barometer of what a lot of people -- what a lot of people in this room -- are going to be interested in on a daily basis			1
" @entity96 , he was quick to mention @entity97 as a website that he checks			0
" in some ways , they style themselves as the @entity82 of politics			0
" @entity11 said the @entity12 would continue to seek new and nontraditional ways for the president to reach the public , just as past administrations have			1
" there 's no question that , at least in my view , that the president is the best advocate for his policies , " he said			2
" he is somebody who has a very clear sense of what his priorities are			0
and when he can be put in a position where he can communicate those priorities , we 're firing on all cylinders			0
we 're running at our best			0
" he joked about the recent emmy nomination for @entity4 's interview on @entity123 ' satirical online talk show " @entity124 " : " i think the president would say that it 's an honor just being nominated			2
" ( the awards will be presented in august			0
) " we 're always looking for new ideas , " @entity11 said			2
" some of them can be online			0
but maybe there 's a great print idea out there that we have n't come up with yet			2
