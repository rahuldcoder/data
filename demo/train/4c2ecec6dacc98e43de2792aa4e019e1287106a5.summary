when even @entity1 publicly rejects you because you are too brutal , it 's likely a reasonable indicator that you are			1
a long simmering dispute between " @entity5 , " headed by @entity6 , and the most brutal @entity1 affiliate in @entity8 , generally known as the @entity9 , surfaced publicly on monday			1
on jihadist websites , @entity1 's central leadership posted a notice saying @entity9 " is not a branch of the @entity1 group			1
" it is the first time in its quarter century history that @entity1 has officially rejected one of its affiliates			0
why did this happen ? @entity9 and another @entity1 affiliate known as the @entity21 have been fighting each other in @entity8 for several weeks now			1
this open warfare caps a dispute between @entity9 and @entity25 about who is boss in @entity8 that has been brewing since @entity9 released a statement in april announcing its official merger with @entity25			0
a leader of @entity25 rejected the merger , and in june , @entity6 annulled the merger			0
@entity9 , in turn , rejected @entity6 's annulment of the merger			0
( this is a fine example of what @entity36 usefully termed " the narcissism of minor differences			0
" ) @entity6 is clearly fed up with @entity9 's open rejection of his overall leadership of the @entity1 network			1
moreover , he is likely quite concerned about how @entity9 is alienating ordinary @entity8 by a brutal campaign that has involved the public beheading of opponents and the imposition of @entity48 - style rule on the population , including the banning of smoking , music and unveiled women in public			0
@entity1 's leader has seen this movie before -- in western @entity57 in 2006 , when @entity1 in @entity57 ( the parent organization of @entity9 ) imposed a brutal @entity48 - like rule on the population that caused the @entity61 tribes in western @entity57 to rebel against @entity1 in an uprising known as " the @entity64			1
" the @entity64 , with a heavy assist from the @entity67 military , led to @entity1 losing control of much of western @entity57 by 2008			2
@entity25 seems to have learned from the mistakes of @entity1 in @entity57 and is not imposing @entity48 - style rule in the areas of @entity8 that it controls and is instead operating in a @entity72 - like manner , providing social services			2
the group , for instance , provides bread and electricity in the eastern @entity8 city of @entity79 , where it also controls the city 's wheat silos and oil wells			2
@entity84 also is engaging in the kind of alliance - building that @entity1 affiliates generally have not been able to pull off because they regard compromise as a deviation from their @entity91 - given beliefs			0
@entity25 has , for instance , allied with more moderate elements of the @entity8 opposition to fight against @entity9 during the past several weeks			2
@entity25 , in fact , represents what @entity1 's core leadership wants in one of its affiliates : a group that does n't tarnish the @entity1 brand by using brutal tactics against fellow @entity104			1
this has been a core concern for @entity1 for the past decade			0
@entity6 sent a letter to @entity1 in @entity57 in the summer of 2005 admonishing the group against its campaign of killing @entity111 civilians			0
similarly , @entity112 wrote a private letter to the @entity1 - aligned @entity115 terrorist group , @entity114 , in 2010 telling the organization to stop attacking in the central market of the @entity115 capital , @entity119 , because such attacks were killing @entity104 civilians			2
also in 2010 , @entity1 leaders wrote a private letter to the leader of the @entity125 @entity48 telling him forcefully to suspend his group 's campaign of attacks against mosques and markets , which was killing hundreds of @entity125 civilians			1
the difference now is that @entity1 has gone public with its displeasure with @entity9 and is also officially cutting the group off			0
despite the bitter differences between the two @entity1 - aligned groups in @entity8 , senior @entity67 counterterrorism officials tell me they are " all @entity8			1
" that is because @entity1 affiliated groups in @entity8 and neighboring @entity57 now control more territory in the @entity143 world than at any time in their history ; a swath of land that runs from northwestern @entity8 some 400 miles to the east into western @entity57			2
on tuesday , cia director @entity149 testified before the @entity150 : " there are camps inside of both @entity57 and @entity8 that are used by @entity1 to develop capabilities that are applicable , both in the theater , as well as beyond			2
" @entity149 asserted that these camps represent a real threat to the @entity67			0
adding to their concerns , @entity67 counterterrorism officials tell me that more @entity67 have traveled to fight in @entity8 than was previously understood			1
they believe some 70 @entity67 have fought there over the past three years			0
previous estimates suggested only a handful of @entity67 had done so			0
@entity67 counterterrorism officials are rightly concerned that @entity67 who have fought in @entity8 will return to the @entity67 radicalized and perhaps even to plan to carry out terrorist attacks			1
that said , it is n't clear how many of the 70 @entity67 who are estimated to have fought in @entity8 have done so alongside the @entity1 - aligned groups or with other more moderate rebel groups who are fighting the @entity168 regime with some degree of @entity67 support .			1

a @entity8 rebel group has been *disowned* by @entity1
@entity174 says @entity1 's central leadership seems put off by the group 's brutality
the split could *weaken* @entity1 's grip in @entity8 , after it made advances there , he says
@entity184 : @entity67 officials believe more @entity67 have gone to fight *vs.* the @entity8 regime
