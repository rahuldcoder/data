-- prime minister @entity1 faces a growing political storm over how to measure poverty in @entity4 amid fears that new benchmarks proposed by a powerful policymaking body could see many of the country 's poor lose their welfare benefits			1
the poverty line estimates in @entity4 , traditionally worked out by calorie intake , are highly sensitive because as many as 400m @entity4 live on less than $ 2 a day			1
those below the poverty line are entitled to subsidised food and other welfare payments			0
but new benchmarks by the @entity16 , submitted in an affidavit to the @entity18 as part of new food security legislation , suggest that a person living on more than @entity22 ( $ 0.64 ) a day in urban areas , like @entity24 and @entity25 , would no longer be classified as being below the poverty line			0
the threshold for rural areas would be @entity28 a day			0
by comparison , the @entity30 's poverty line is $ 1.25 a day			2
@entity4 is now home to more poor people than the entire @entity35 region			1
two years ago , a government appointed commission estimated that one in three @entity4 live below the poverty line			2
the commission 's estimate was higher than an earlier @entity16 estimate of 28 per cent of the population			0
but @entity43 , the respected economist who is now the @entity16 's deputy chairman , has argued that up - to - date data will show that @entity4 has made considerable progress in reducing poverty levels			1
the proposed new benchmarks have angered leaders across @entity4 's political spectrum			1
they have also opened @entity4 's two most respected government economists -- mr @entity1 and mr @entity43 -- up to criticism that they are out of touch with the poor in @entity4 , who are struggling with the highest inflation of any large emerging market			1
@entity58 , a former finance minister and @entity60 leader , lambasted poverty threshold estimates put forward by the @entity16 as " laughable "			2
mr @entity58 derided the body 's calculations as having exposed mr @entity1 , who cuts an increasingly solitary figure in his cabinet after a year battling high profile scandals , as insensitive to what was " a matter of life and death " for many people and the cause of violence across @entity4			1
" neither the prime minister nor the deputy chairman of the @entity16 has any real idea of poverty			1
they rarely go to the villages and interact with the poor , " mr @entity58 said			0
the benchmarks have also divided the @entity16 itself			0
a senior member of the commission told the @entity0 that the poverty line figures should not have been included in the affidavit			0
he said the government had to do better on how it communicated economic policy to the country 's 1.2bn people			2
" i would n't have put these numbers in , " he said			0
" you ca n't [ as an economic planner in @entity4 ] get on your high horse of economic rationalism			2
" senior @entity97 party ministers have also raised objections			0
@entity99 , the minister for rural development and a close ally of @entity97 president @entity101 , has written to mr @entity43 asking him to consider alternative measurements and warning of possible confrontation			0
@entity105 , a member of the @entity106 chaired by mrs @entity101 , said rs32 a day went nowhere in @entity4 's fast - growing cities where rents are high and food inflation in double digits			1
