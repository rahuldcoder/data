-- attention , holiday shoppers : put away your wallets and credit cards			2
if you 're looking for a gift that will please someone close to you , there 's one that wo n't cost you a cent , and that you wo n't find on any store shelf			1
this thought occurred the other day when , on a visit to the west coast of @entity17 , i was walking through a crowded outdoor mall and the familiar voice of @entity20 wafted out of the loudspeaker system : " if i do n't see her each day i miss her			1
. " i recognized the song immediately			2
" believe me , i 've got a case , " @entity25 , with the laughing face			0
. " it 's one of the songs @entity20 cherished most			1
and what does that have to do with the most meaningful present you can give to a loved one this holiday season ? there 's a story behind the song : a story with a lesson			1
in the early 1940s , when @entity20 was a relatively young man , he and his wife were having a birthday party for their firstborn child , @entity25			1
among the invited guests were two good friends of @entity20 : the wonderful musical composer @entity44 , and the brilliant comedic actor @entity45			1
@entity44 and @entity45 wanted to bring a gift			1
but what could they purchase that @entity20 himself could not provide for his daughter ? what the two men did was revise a song they 'd been working on			1
@entity44 had written the melody ; @entity45 was the writer of the lyrics			1
( he would go on to immense fame in the 1950s playing @entity58 sgt. @entity57 on @entity60 television , but his talents extended to many fields			0
) their song , in an early version , had featured the words " @entity69 , with the laughing face , " referring to the wife of a colleague			2
now they worked some more on it , and fashioned the lyrics for @entity20 's young daughter			1
they played and sang it at the birthday party			0
@entity20 adored it ; by some accounts , he was so moved by the gesture from his friends that he began to cry			1
talk about a gift for the man who has everything : what are you going to give to @entity20 that he will remember ? a tie ? a car ? a bottle of liquor ? he needed nothing			1
but that song , and the effort his two friends had put into it , touched him so deeply that , until his dying day , it signified something achingly personal to him			1
and now it 's the holiday season			1
we 've all read about the mobs of people at door - buster sales , the fights in the aisles of stores			0
yet there is a way that each of us , if we are willing to invest the hours , can come up with a gift that will mean more than any flat - screen television or video game			2
if you 're good with words , write the best and longest letter you 've ever written to a family member who maybe does n't know just what he or she means to you			2
that letter will be kept , and treasured , long after gifts bought in a store have worn out or been thrown away			2
if you 're artistic , paint a picture with a special significance that the person you love will understand			0
if you 're the organized type , gather family photos from over the years , select them carefully , and put them together in an album that will mean everything to the person who receives it			2
if you 're musical ... well , do for the person you care about what @entity45 and @entity44 did for @entity20 and his family			1
will the effort be time - consuming ? yes , and that 's the point			0
it will certainly be time better spent than standing in line for hours before some big - box store opens its doors for midnight bargains			0
because i 'd heard about the @entity20 story for so many years , i called his younger daughter @entity142 the other afternoon to ask her about its veracity -- and its meaning to her family			1
" all of it is true , " she said			0
she said that her dad , @entity45 and @entity44 were dear buddies who loved to spend time together : " there would be @entity152 parties where they 'd set up a stage , and play charades games			1
they just liked being around each other			0
" when the two men presented the song at the birthday party , she said , " it was done out of pure friendship			0
" her father and her mother -- whose name was also @entity25 -- could n't have been more moved by the personal nature of the gift			1
@entity142 had not yet been born , but the reason she is certain of this , she said , is that her dad talked about it , from time to time , for the rest of his life			2
and for him , the song -- and the memories of his friends who wrote it -- never diminished in emotional power			0
she recalled one time in @entity181 when her dad was in a brittle mood over some things that were going on in his life			2
he was angry and irritable ; at a concert , as he worked his way through his song list , his agitation was evident to everyone who knew him			0
but then he got to " @entity190 ) "			0
" his entire physicality changed , " @entity142 said			0
the gentleness of the song , and the meaning of the story behind it , did that to him			0
he went from being tense and on edge to being like an at - ease sergeant			0
" the gift from his buddies did that for him , all those years later			0
the best gifts are like that			0
here 's hoping you 'll find the right one			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			2

@entity210 : in 1940 's , @entity44 , @entity45 gave personal gift to @entity20
he says it was song " @entity216 " for @entity20 's daughter . he prized it
@entity210 : *mulling* a good holiday gift ? consider *homemade* : letters , a photo album
