-- in @entity3 culture , it is traditional to open a conversation with " @entity5 , " which means " and how are the children ? " the prominent value that the @entity10 place on the well - being of their children has me thinking about the well - being of our own children here in @entity16			1
we rejoice with those who crossed the stage to receive their high school diplomas last spring , and look forward to the accomplishments of those who start school soon			1
indeed , our children are doing well			0
for the first time in our nation 's history , 80 % of young @entity16 graduated from high school on time , according to the @entity29 a @entity30			1
this is a significant achievement for those young graduates and our country as a whole			2
at that rate of increase , we can and should push forward to the goal of 90 % on - time high school graduation by 2020			1
four successive presidents have set forth this goal , and at last we are on track			0
but this statistic tells only a piece of the story about the well - being of our children			2
it disregards too quickly the remaining 20 % -- about 800,000 young people per year -- who do n't graduate on time			1
what happens to them ? why are these young people not progressing , despite all of our best efforts ? who are they ? and what must we do to help them stay on track and thrive as contributors to the economy of our country ? over the past year , @entity62 has been seeking those answers , right from the source			2
our center for promise at @entity67 interviewed hundreds of young people who did not graduate on time or at all			1
and then we surveyed thousands of young people from all 50 states			2
so , how are our children ? their responses , compiled and analyzed in the report " @entity73 , " are heartbreaking , humbling and ultimately hopeful			0
so many young people described the circumstances in which they grew up , environments made toxic by physical and emotional abuse , exposure to extreme violence , family stress and caretaking responsibilities			2
young people have many reasons for leaving school , not all of them related to boredom or lack of motivation			1
many leave because of complex and challenging life circumstances that , without proper adult support , make leaving school look like the only option			1
in the wake of leaving school without graduating , many showed tremendous optimism and a drive to achieve adult success			0
they want for themselves what we want for them : more education , a solid job , a strong family , a stable place to live			0
with this backdrop , it 's no surprise that many of the people we interviewed took exception to the term " dropout			1
" they do n't feel that they " dropped out " or , worse , quit			0
they simply made a decision to change the course of their lives			0
nothing will be easy about increasing our national high school graduation rates			1
however , for the sake of our nation 's future , we must not forget about the potential that exists in 20 % of our nation 's students			1
yes , all students need high quality schools with strong teachers and strong curricula , but they also need environments where they are heard			0
set preconceptions and assumptions aside , and just listen hard			0
try to understand their experiences and perspective , however challenging			0
show them , in some way , that you care about their future			2
for our young adults with the highest needs , more schools should incorporate an early warning system to identify students whose attendance , behavior and course performance suggest that they need extra support to stay in school			1
communities should consider how to create similar early - warning supports and systems beyond the school building for young adults affected by risk factors like a death in the family , an incarcerated parent or housing instability			1
as good stewards of our communities , we must help provide the support that our young people need for success , and that means learning from one another			2
with proven and promising examples of success happening all across the country , in and out of the classroom , we must create more opportunities for school systems and communities to collaborate with one another			0
it 's in that sharing , that great progress can be made			0
the question " how are our children ? " is the right one to be asking			0
but , let 's not be afraid of the challenging and complex answers that comes with it			0
at graduation season , and every day , let 's celebrate our high achievers while giving equal care to those young people taking the less common road .			1

for the first time , 80 % of young @entity16 graduated from high school on time
@entity197 : we ca n't disregard the well - being of the 20 % who did n't
@entity202 : many of them *object* to the term " dropout " ; they just decided to change course
she says we must offer support , identify them early , show we care about their futures
