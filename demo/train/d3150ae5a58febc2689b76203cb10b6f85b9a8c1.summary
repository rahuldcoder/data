-- years ago , experts told the world that the @entity3 would radically change our cities			1
a lot of us are still waiting			2
how cool , they said			2
cities will be able to use the language of data to virtually talk to us , sharing information so communities can become superefficient , saving untold billions of dollars			1
traffic management would untangle our commutes			1
life , they said , would get a little easier			2
well , some of this stuff is actually happening in places around the world			0
but in many other cities , businesses and governments have been ... moving ... kind of ... slow			1
what 's the hold up ? where 's my talking city ? apparently all those predictions a few years ago resulted in a dubious backlash , says @entity33 , department director at @entity35 's @entity34			1
experts " made a lot of promises about what this technology , just for technology 's sake , could do			1
" now , @entity43 says the emphasis is on using smart city technology to help people make better decisions for themselves			1
during the past few years , a handful of so - called smart cities have been built from the ground up , in places such as the @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			1
you 've got to wonder what they 'll teach us about how to bring smarter technology to the places we live , play and work			0
how might that technology grow in the @entity63 ? what should @entity63 city dwellers expect in the next five years ? let 's take a look at the smart coastal city of @entity69 , near @entity70 , @entity53			1
price tag : roughly $ 35 billion			0
although it 's not due to be completed until 2017 , tens of thousands of people live there already , according to developers			0
eventually the city plans to be home to 65,000 residents and a workplace for 300,000 commuters			0
sensors distributed throughout buildings and roads monitor and regulate energy consumption and traffic flow			1
sensors also tell commuters when their bus is coming			1
inside homes , a trash disposal system sucks household garbage from kitchens through long tunnels to waste processing centers			0
near @entity99 , @entity95 , construction of a smart city called @entity98 has been delayed by the nation 's economic troubles in 2011			1
developers reportedly are about to begin building the first phase , which would house about 7,000			0
@entity98 has what planners call an " operating system , " which includes millions of sensors that send data in real time to a central computer that uses the information to keep the city working at peak environmental efficiency			1
theoretically , buildings would be able to sense if they 're on fire , alert firefighters and coordinate traffic flow to help first responders arrive a the scene as soon as possible			1
in the @entity52 , the solar powered desert berg of @entity122 reportedly is about to break ground on its first neighborhood of 500 smart private homes			1
@entity126 has boasted environmentally sustainable educational and business districts for several years , and planners promise its homes will include technology that make them " super sustainable			0
" @entity54 developers recently opened the town of @entity133 , about an hour west of @entity134 by train			0
this solar powered city , built by @entity137 , is shaped like a leaf and built in three layers -- one on the surface and two underground			0
residents started moving there in march , numbering about 30 families so far			0
the city manages its energy needs in real time by coordinating data from sensors linked to home appliances			1
by the time it 's completed in 2018 , @entity133 is expected to include 1,000 households			0
it aims to provide a global showcase on how to generate renewable energy while reducing carbon dioxide emissions and cutting water use			1
" it 's important to remember that @entity133 is not an experiment , but a project to create a smart sustainable town that continues to grow and develop , with the residents at the core , " says @entity137 spokesman @entity158			2
the project website announces : " we now release our @entity168 model to the world ! " confidence is high , but so are the stakes			0
these smart cities have a lot to prove			1
for one , they 've got to show that their models can solve energy and efficiency problems comprehensively in places where people live and work			2
they also have to demonstrate their successes are not isolated examples			0
in other words , their solutions have to be replicable in other locations			0
" the technology is the easy part , quite frankly , " says infrastructure expert @entity189 of the @entity191 think tank , the @entity192			2
" we know that these things work			0
it 's how you get it done in existing complex environments that 's going to be the hard part			0
" infrastructure has gotten smarter in existing cities across @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206			2
in @entity208 , it 's especially evident in @entity209 , @entity210 ; @entity211 , @entity212 ; @entity213 , @entity214 ; @entity215 , @entity216 ; and @entity217			0
in the @entity63 , experts say smart cities built from scratch will be unlikely			1
retrofitting smart tech into existing city infrastructure has been going on for a while now			1
the built - from - scratch cities might have lessons to offer			2
" @entity126 is developing water conservation solutions with lessons to be learned in places like @entity228 and @entity229 , cities which are still growing here in the @entity63 , " @entity189 says			1
innovation districts experts point to @entity63 cities leading the way , such as @entity236 , @entity35 , @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240			1
some communities have established special innovation districts that are outfitted with smart technology and a lot of broadband internet			2
the idea is to attract businesses that want smart tech efficiency to move to those districts			1
from those seeds , planners hope a smart tech wave will spread citywide			1
now under construction on @entity256 's @entity255 : @entity257 , an ambitious 28 - acre neighborhood of skyscrapers filled with offices , retail and residential space			0
by the time it 's completed in 2018 , @entity257 is expected to be highly wired up			0
how 's the air quality ? they 'll track it			0
movement of garbage and recyclables ? they plan data for that			2
there will be data tracking movement of people on the property			2
if tenants want to , they can use the building 's smartphone app to track their personal health stats			0
" we have a lot of experiments going on around the @entity63 right now , " says @entity189			1
" it 's getting those routinized that 's going to be a big challenge			0
that will be a big problem throughout the @entity63			1
there 's really nobody that 's doing it all completely perfect			0
" the key is looking at the data as a whole , so community leaders can use it to see the big picture and make changes that will yield big benefits like reducing carbon emissions or saving money			1
but progress has been slow			0
experts blame the most recent recession , fear of risk and bureaucratic inertia			1
also , differing business cultures add another layer to the challenge			0
" in many cases the real estate industry is one that 's very slow to change , " says @entity33			0
" this is a rather dramatic paradigm shift for how the real estate industry and how planners will conduct their business			0
so i think it 's going to take a little bit of time , but we 're starting to see momentum building			0
" shake it up one suggestion , say experts : shake up the bureaucracy			2
" historically cities have operated in silos along different agencies , " says @entity33			2
" but as we 're getting into this ability to measure and monitor all kinds of data , cities really need to have much tighter cohesion -- much more coordination -- across different branches			1
" " we 've got to reform government in many ways and formalize collaboration between different city agencies , " says @entity189			0
problem - solving mayors are appointing business - savvy data chiefs who coordinate several departments			2
they 're armed with mandates to make things happen			0
and it 's not just about sensors inside buildings and bridges			1
in @entity360 , @entity361 , smart sensors embedded in asthma inhalers were used in a medical study that pinpointed locations of asthma attack clusters and then investigated whether the locations contributed to the attacks			1
" where i see the best use of all of this smart technology is ways to improve quality of life , " @entity33 says			2
" including understanding the connection between poverty and health and the built environment			0
" within the next five years , the @entity63 can expect to see more smart tech linked to transportation			1
why ? government officials with tight budgets will want to increase efficiency			0
" once states realize there 's not a lot of money coming for new construction , they 're going to have to figure out new ways to solve problems like traffic congestion , " @entity189 says			2
right now , the biggest challenge surrounding the installation of large - scale smart tech is cost			1
the solution , @entity189 says , includes finding the right mix of public and private networks that can finance retrofitting the nation 's big cities			2
" if we can get those business models done right , " he says , " then there 's no stopping this			0
" what smart city tech are you seeing in your community ? let us know about it in the comments section below .			1

*unfulfilled* promises of *superwired* smart cities spark a dubious backlash
expert : *stifling* @entity63 bureaucracy and fear of risk stand in the way
some @entity63 cities are embedding data sensors in energy grids , buildings , traffic hubs
smart tech could save billions of dollars and reduce energy use , traffic jams , carbon *pollution*
