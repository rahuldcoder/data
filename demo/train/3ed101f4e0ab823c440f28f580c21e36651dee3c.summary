the following year , @entity4 re-emerged as a more radicalized , insurgent - style group , staging assassinations and attacks against not only government targets , but also churches and even a beer garden			1
" we 're dealing with a movement of inchoate rage , " said @entity238 , a @entity87 ambassador to @entity2 who left his post in 2007			2
" it 's highly decentralized , but what it has in common is a strongly @entity181 character , and hatred for the secular , political economy of @entity2 , particularly the federal and state governments , " he said .			2
