-- the @entity1 wo n't help , good pal @entity2 is sitting this one out , so president @entity4 will take his case for a military attack on @entity7 directly to the @entity9 people next week			1
@entity4 wrapped up his trip to the @entity12 summit in @entity13 by telling reporters he will address the nation on tuesday as @entity16 prepares to vote on a resolution authorizing limited military strikes against @entity7 over its alleged use of chemical weapons			1
facing public opposition reflected by legislators hesitant to support him , @entity4 said friday that he understands the skepticism over his call for punishing the regime of @entity7 president @entity27 for what @entity9 officials call a sarin gas attack on august 21 that killed more than 1,400 people			1
" the @entity9 people have gone through a lot when it comes to the military over the last decade or so , " @entity4 said			1
he also cited a responsibility borne by the @entity9 as a global power to lead what he hopes would be an international response in order to maintain the credibility of treaties and conventions against weapons of mass destruction			1
" i believe when you have a limited proportional strike like this , with manageable risks , then we should bear that responsibility , " @entity4 said , noting that military interventions often lack broad public support but that critics also decry inaction in the face of atrocities abroad			1
foreign interventions unpopular " when people say that it is a terrible stain on all of us that hundreds of thousands of people were slaughtered in @entity62 , well imagine if @entity62 was going on right now and we asked : ' should we intervene in @entity62 ? ' " the president said			0
" i think it 's fair to say that it probably would n't poll real well			0
" opposition by permanent @entity68 members @entity13 and @entity69 has scuttled @entity4 's hopes for @entity1 authorization of a military response against @entity27 's regime , and usually reliable ally @entity2 's @entity74 decided against joining a military response			2
the inability to muster a significant international coalition , like the @entity79 - led mission with @entity81 support that intervened in @entity82 , caused the president to seek political cover by requesting congressional authorization			2
" we will be more effective if we are unified moving forward , " @entity4 said in explaining why he asked for support from @entity16 for what he argues is a necessary response to the violation of international norms by @entity7			1
in a likely foreshadowing of @entity4 's address to the nation next week , @entity1 ambassador @entity92 told the liberal @entity96 on friday that non-military alternatives to attacking @entity7 had been exhausted			1
she cited repeated steps by @entity13 , joined at times by @entity69 , to undermine @entity68 action on @entity7 over the past two years			0
because of @entity13 , @entity92 said , " the @entity68 was not even able to put out a statement expressing its disapproval " of the august 21 chemical weapons attack			0
administration lobbying blitz @entity4 's speech on tuesday will culminate an aggressive outreach strategy intended to woo members of @entity16 to back his pitch for limited strikes , which are expected to be missile attacks at @entity7 military command targets but not chemical weapons stockpiles			1
the administration says it has intercepts and other intelligence that show the @entity7 regime planned the attack and then attempted to cover it up			0
secretary of state @entity118 told a @entity120 committee this week that @entity9 intelligence shows the rockets carrying chemical weapons were launched from territory controlled by the @entity7 regime and landed in opposition or contested areas of suburban @entity127			1
@entity118 and @entity2 officials say the gas used in the attack was sarin , according to test results			0
@entity1 inspectors who collected samples from the stricken area are expected to provide their own results in coming weeks			0
however , after a week of classified briefings , two congressional hearings and other aggressive lobbying by the administration , a majority of the @entity120 and @entity138 remain " undecided " on whether to give @entity4 authorization to attack , according to @entity0 's latest count			1
in addition , a growing number of legislators say they oppose the move , though it remains too early to predict an outcome			0
a heavy lift for @entity4 " i knew this was going to be a heavy lift , " @entity4 said during friday 's news conference in @entity152 , @entity13			0
supporters and critics have called for the president to directly address the @entity9 public and make his case for why a military response was necessary			2
" members of @entity16 represent the views of their constituents , and only a president can convince the public that military action is required , " said @entity161 , the spokesman for @entity138 speaker @entity162 , who has said he backs @entity4 on the issue			1
" we only hope this is n't coming too late to make the difference			0
" in the past two weeks , the @entity4 administration has spoken to at least 60 senators and 125 @entity138 members on the issue , a @entity138 official confirmed friday			1
on thursday alone , while the president was in @entity13 , he and senior administration officials made more than 25 individual calls to what the @entity138 described as bipartisan members of the @entity138 and @entity120			2
@entity4 called five senators himself , the @entity138 said , but officials refused to reveal the names of the recipients			2
in addition , members of the @entity138 and @entity120 were meeting at the @entity138 on friday with vice president @entity187 , an administration official confirmed to @entity0			2
it was @entity187 's second straight day of meetings with legislators to try to convince them to authorize a military response			0
@entity4 cancels trip go it alone ? should @entity16 reject @entity4 's request to authorize military strikes , deputy national security adviser @entity195 said friday on @entity198 that " the president of course has the authority " to act in @entity7 without support from @entity203 , but " it 's neither his desire nor intention to use that authority absent @entity16 backing him			1
" a senior administration official from the @entity210 later clarified @entity195 's remark , saying " the president 's intention is to act with congressional authorization , and we believe they will vote to provide that authorization			2
" asked several times at the news conference about @entity195 's remark and whether he would attack @entity7 anyway without authorization from @entity16 , @entity4 acknowledged that he would avoid providing a direct answer			1
" it would be a mistake for me to jump the gun and speculate because right now i 'm working to get as much support as possible out of @entity226 , " he said			0
on wednesday , the @entity227 approved an amended version of the @entity138 's resolution for authorization to attack @entity7 by a 10 - 7 vote			1
senate majority leader @entity232 on friday praised the panel 's @entity234 and @entity235 leaders for working together to craft a compromise that was able win approval			0
@entity232 spoke at a brief @entity120 session that allowed for the procedural step of setting up next week 's consideration of the resolution by the full @entity120			0
election politics at play meanwhile , the @entity138 also is expected to take up the @entity7 issue starting monday , with @entity245 leader @entity245 of @entity246 telling his @entity235 caucus to expect a vote on military authorization " in the next two weeks			1
" approval of a resolution is considered more likely by the @entity234 - led @entity120 than the @entity235 - led @entity138			2
45 - day delay ? in a step that would buy time for @entity4 to get more international and domestic support , @entity234 sen. @entity252 of @entity246 is working on a proposal that would put off any military action for 45 days while demanding that @entity7 sign an international convention against chemical weapons or face @entity9 military repercussions , according to an aide to @entity252			1
it was unclear if the idea would gain any traction among legislators considering the @entity7 issue			0
on the sidelines of the @entity12 summit friday , @entity4 and @entity13 president @entity266 met for what @entity4 described as a " candid , constructive " conversation despite increasingly strained relations between the two leaders			0
@entity4 acknowledged that @entity266 was unlikely to shift his position on military action against @entity7 , and @entity266 gave a similar account of their meeting , telling reporters that " he does n't agree with me , i do n't agree with him , but we listened to each other			2
" the two leaders both said they could work together to seek a political solution to the @entity7 crisis , which reiterated their longstanding positions			0
how will @entity138 vote ? how will @entity120 vote ? @entity0 's @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity287 and @entity288 contributed to this report .			0
