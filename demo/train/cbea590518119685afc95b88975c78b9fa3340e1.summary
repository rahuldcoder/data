-- scientists have discovered the first confirmed earthlike planet outside our solar system , they announced wednesday			2
an artist 's impression shows what the planet may look like in close orbit with its sun. " this is the first confirmed rocky planet in another system , " astronomer @entity12 told @entity0 , contrasting the solid planet with gaseous ones like @entity15 and @entity16			1
but " @entity20 " is a relative term			0
the planet 's composition may be similar to that of @entity26 , but its environment is more like a vision of hell , the project 's lead astronomer said			1
it is so close to the star it orbits " that the place may well look like @entity34 , with a probable temperature on its ' day face ' above 3,600 degrees @entity38 ( 2,000 degrees @entity37 ) and minus - 328 degrees @entity38 ( minus 200 degrees @entity37 ) on its night face , " said @entity40 of @entity41 in @entity42 , the project leader			1
@entity12 , explaining that one side of the body is always facing the star and the other side always faces away , said the side " facing the sun is probably molten			2
the other side could actually have ice " if there is water on the planet			0
" we think it has no atmosphere to redistribute the heat , " @entity12 told @entity0 from @entity54 , @entity55 , where he is attending the " @entity57 " conference			0
the astronomers were stunned to find a rocky planet so near a star , he said			2
" we would have never dreamed you would find a rocky planet so close , " he said			2
" its year is less than one of our days			0
" the planet , known as @entity69 - 7b , was detected early last year , but it took months of observation to determine that it had a composition roughly similar to @entity26 's , the @entity67 said in a statement			1
astronomers were able to measure the dimensions of the planet by watching as it passed in front of the star it orbits , then carried out 70 hours of study of the planet 's effect on its star to infer its weight			1
with that information in hand , they were able to calculate its density -- and were thrilled with what they found , @entity12 said			0
" what makes this exciting is you compare the density of this planet to the planets in our solar system , it 's only @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity26 that are similar , " @entity12 , of the @entity95 observatory in @entity96 , told @entity0			1
they were helped by the fact that @entity69 - 7b is relatively close to @entity26 -- about 500 light years away , in the constellation of @entity109 , the @entity109			1
" it 's in our solar neighborhood , " @entity12 said			0
" the thing that made it easier is it 's relatively close , so it 's relatively bright			2
if this star was much much farther away , we would n't have been able to do these measurements			0
" at about five times @entity26 's mass ( though not quite twice as large in circumference ) , it is the smallest planet ever spotted outside our solar system			1
it also has the fastest orbit			0
the planet whizzes around its star more than seven times faster than @entity26 moves , and is 23 times closer to the star than @entity104 is to our sun. the planet was first detected early in 2008 by the @entity69 satellite , a 30 - centimeter space telescope launched by the @entity133 in december 2006 , specifically with the mission of detecting rocky planets outside the solar system			1
at least 42 scientists at 17 institutions on three continents worked on the project			0
they are publishing their findings in a special issue of the @entity144 journal on october 22 as " the @entity146 @entity145 : two orbiting super-earths			0

the planet , known as @entity69 - 7b , was detected early last year
it took months to determine that it had a composition roughly similar to @entity26 's
the planet is about five times more massive than @entity26
astronomer : it is so close to the star it orbits that it may " look like @entity34 "
