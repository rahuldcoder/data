-- @entity2 has assumed " the supreme commandership " of the @entity5 army , state media reported saturday			1
the power was transferred to him on october 8 at the behest of his father , @entity8 , who died this month , said the state - run @entity10			2
the announcement came a day after prospects for a shift in relations on the @entity15 were dashed when @entity5 said a change in leadership would not mean a change in policy			0
" we solemnly declare with confidence that the @entity25 puppets and foolish politicians around the world should not expect any change " from @entity5 , the country 's @entity20 said in a statement reported by @entity10			1
that statement came after two days of elaborate ceremonies in @entity31 that honored @entity8 and underlined the rise of his son and chosen successor , @entity2 , to the position of " supreme leader " of the secretive state			1
the nuclear - armed @entity5 " will have no dealings with the @entity43 group of traitors forever , " the statement said in an english - language version of the @entity10 report			0
@entity43 is the @entity25 president			0
@entity25 's @entity46 expressed disappointment			2
" the ministry finds today 's statement regretful , " it said			0
" however , the ministry 's basic principle towards easing tensions in inter-korean relations and resolving problems through dialogues remains still			0
the ministry hopes @entity5 to regain stability in the near future and present constructive attitude			0
" the @entity61 criticized the @entity25 government 's decision to allow only a select group of private citizens to visit @entity31 to pay their respects to @entity8 , whose death was announced last week			1
@entity43 's government 's " show of enmity " toward @entity5 " culminated in its act of blocking south @entity25 who wanted to visit @entity31 to mourn the demise of leader @entity8 , " the statement said			1
@entity75 allowed a group of @entity25 , including a former first lady and a leading businesswoman , to travel to the @entity5 earlier this week to express condolences over @entity8 's death			1
that move , along with a number of other gestures like expressing condolences to the @entity5 people , suggested a slight softening in @entity43 's government 's hardline stance toward @entity31			2
the @entity61 , though , did not appear to be impressed by those efforts , expressing anger friday that more @entity25 were n't permitted to visit @entity31 and that groups were allowed this week to release leaflets near the border criticizing @entity5 leaders			1
it also said that the @entity25 's decision to put its military on alert after @entity8 's death created " a war - like atmosphere on the ground and in the seas and air			1
" in one of the more vehement passages of saber - rattling rhetoric , the defense commission warned of revenge over these perceived misdeeds			0
" the veritable sea of tears shed by the army and people " of @entity5 " will turn into that of retaliatory fire to burn all the group of traitors to the last one and their wailing into a roar of revenge to smash the stronghold of the puppet forces , " the statement said			0
amid concerns over change in @entity5 leadership , a top @entity123 diplomat plans to travel to the region early next year in the first such talks since @entity8 's death , the @entity121 announced thursday			2
assistant secretary for @entity136 and @entity137 affairs @entity134 will " discuss a range of important bilateral , regional and global issues " during his four days in @entity132 , @entity25 and @entity133			2
