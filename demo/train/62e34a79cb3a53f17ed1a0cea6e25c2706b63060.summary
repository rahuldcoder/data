@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 prime minister @entity3 hailed the passage of a wide - ranging package of constitutional amendments as a " milestone for democracy " after voters approved the measures in a sunday referendum			1
in a resounding victory for @entity3 and his ruling @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , voters approved the 26 amendments by a wide margin sunday			1
the country 's current constitution was enacted after a military coup that took place on september 12 , 1980 , 30 years to the day before sunday 's vote			1
" our nation has said from now on , we go forward , " @entity3 told supporters sunday night			1
yes to rule of law			2
no to the law of the rulers			2
the tutelage of the coup regime is over			0
" but with more than 96 percent of the votes counted , 58 percent of voters favored the referendum , while 42 percent were opposed , @entity0 's electoral board reported			1
more coverage at @entity37 the proposed amendments include articles that would allow collective bargaining for public sector workers and affirmative action measures for women			0
but when asked what was the most important achievement of the reform package , a senior @entity3 adviser made it clear that the main goal was to overhaul the country 's judiciary			1
the proposed reforms include amendments to the judicial system , curbs on the power of military courts and an article abolishing the immunity currently enjoyed by the leaders of the 1980 coup			1
other measures would guarantee gender equality and put in place measures to protect children , the elderly and the disabled			0
one of the amendments increases the number of judges on @entity0 's highest court from 11 to 17			1
it also grants the parliament , which is controlled by @entity3 's party , the power to appoint several judges			1
the senior @entity3 adviser , who who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak with the media , told @entity2 the package would " break the caste system of the judiciary			2
" in his victory speech , @entity3 apologized to political rivals he insulted during a bruising and divisive campaign in the run - up to sunday 's vote			1
but to thunderous applause , he announced , " we are going to free the judiciary from an ideological abyss			0
" opponents argued that the amendments would further undermine the secular foundations on which modern @entity0 was established in 1923 , giving the prime minister too much power over the judiciary and making him a " modern - day sultan			1
" @entity97 , head of the main opposition @entity99 's @entity1 branch , told @entity2 that by packaging the judicial changes with less controversial proposals , the @entity14 had " coated a poisonous pill with chocolate			2
" " this will put all the branches of government into one man 's hand , " @entity97 said			0
" it will be one - man rule , like @entity111 , or the @entity112			0
" and @entity113 , the head of @entity0 's @entity114 , this week warned that the changes would politicize the judiciary			1
but @entity3 said the amendments would bring greater freedom and democracy			2
" can there be anything wiser and more meaningful than going from a coup constitution to the constitution of the people ? " @entity3 told @entity2 last week			2
@entity0 lawmakers approved the package earlier this year , but not by the two - thirds majority necessary for the government to press ahead without a referendum			2
the measures have also been ratified by @entity0 president @entity131 , @entity3 's @entity14 ally			1
" people have voted for amendments that signal a desire for change to an outdated system of government , " said @entity132 , a columnist with @entity0 's @entity134 newspaper			1
" @entity3 clearly has come out of this with a solid mandate			0
but i do hope he now abandons the harsh rhetoric he has been using during the electoral process and reach out to secularists and the @entity147			0
" sunday 's vote is the latest confrontation in a power struggle between @entity3 's @entity152 - rooted party and @entity0 's secularist establishment , which have repeatedly clashed since @entity14 swept to power eight years ago			1
the @entity14 narrowly avoided being banned from politics in 2008 when it was fined by the country 's constitutional court -- one of the last bastions of secular opposition -- for alleged anti-secular activities			2
the court has also blocked legislation to lift a ban on @entity165 headscarves at public universities			0
" it started out as a referendum on constitutional reform package but it quickly developed into a confrontation between the government and the opposition			0
so it 's really become a vote of confidence in the government , " @entity1 - based journalist @entity173 told @entity2			0
@entity0 's main @entity147 political party , the @entity177 , called on its supporters to boycott the vote altogether , saying their struggle for greater autonomy will continue whatever the result			1
" regardless of who wins , it wo n't stop the war , " @entity183 , the @entity1 co-chairman of the @entity177 , told @entity2			0
" the referendum does not recognize the rights of @entity147			0
" tensions boiled over in downtown @entity1 on friday when @entity147 activists attacked buses and police vehicles with stones , wounding at least one bystander			0
@entity3 insists he will do more to defuse the decades - old simmering conflict which has claimed thousands of lives -- but only after winning the referendum			0
@entity2 's @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 contributed to this report .			0
