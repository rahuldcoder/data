@entity0 -- president @entity2 granted pardons tuesday to 19 citizens charged with a variety of crimes , but none was prominent			1
president @entity2 walks down the @entity9 on tuesday as he departs for @entity10			1
presidential pardon lists are being closely monitored in the final weeks of the @entity2 administration , particularly to see whether former vice presidential aide @entity13 will be granted the presidential favor			1
one of the men pardoned is @entity16 , who died almost 25 years ago			2
his son had worked on winning a presidential pardon for his dad , who had helped smuggle weapons to @entity21 fighting in what was then @entity23 in the late 1940s			1
a @entity24 from @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 spent 18 months behind bars			0
he was the only @entity30 citizen to serve time for helping fly weapons to @entity21 struggling to create @entity33			2
a 20th person received a commutation of a life sentence for possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute			1
that individual , @entity40 , was ordered released from prison in february 2009			0
he will have served more than 12 years			0
" we commend president @entity2 's decision to grant a commutation to @entity40 prior , who is deserving of a second chance , " @entity43 , president of @entity44 , said in a written statement			1
" of course , clemencies only underscore the larger problem -- the systemic injustice caused by mandatory minimum sentences that fill the prisons with low - level drug offenders in the first place			0
" @entity2 has granted 191 pardons and nine commutations , far fewer than presidents @entity61 and @entity62 in their two - term administrations			1
read the full list of pardons among the more notable who have applied for some form of clemency are : former rep. @entity69 , @entity70 from @entity71 , who was convicted of receiving bribes			2

former junk bold salesman @entity75			0

the parents of @entity80 , who was given a 20 - year sentence after pleading guilty to supporting terrorists in @entity83 , held a news conference last week urging @entity2 to commute their son 's sentence			1
it is unclear how many more requests @entity2 may grant before leaving office , although administration officials have said they do not expect any last - minute announcements , as was seen when president @entity61 pardoned fugitive financier @entity92 , setting off a firestorm of controversy			1
a commutation reduces a convict 's prison term , but the conviction remains on the person 's record			0
a pardon , however , wipes the slate clean by erasing the record of the conviction			0
a president has the sole authority to grant clemency and to whom , although a @entity108 office usually reviews applications and makes recommendations after considering standards such as a person 's degree of remorse and ability to lead a responsible and productive life after release			2
those applying for a pardon through the @entity108 are required to wait at least five years after their conviction or release from confinement			0
roughly 1,300 requests for commutation and 860 pardon applications are still pending			0
there is a long tradition of presidents issuing pardons and commutations during the holiday season .			1
