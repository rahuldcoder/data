-- @entity1 did n't consider herself to be one of the boys			1
and for that , we can be grateful			2
over the course of her nearly 50 - year career , @entity5 rummaged through , flipped over and laughed at all the facets of being a woman -- from the ' 60s - era pressure to marry to the reality of aging in a youth - obsessed business -- without ever succumbing to the expectations of what a woman stand - up comedian was " supposed " to sound like			1
" every woman in comedy is indebted to her , " @entity17 , " @entity19 " veteran , said upon @entity5 ' death thursday at the age of 81			1
" she was there at the beginning and funny to the end			0
" @entity1 dies at 81 the path @entity5 helped carve leads us straight to female stand - up powerhouses such as @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , all of whom are as fearless in their humor , and whom they direct it toward , as @entity5 was			1
but when @entity5 began her stand - up career in the late ' 50s , that brazenness was unheard of -- for women , at least			1
" i was talking about having an affair with a married professor and that was n't a thing a nice @entity49 girl talked about , " @entity5 told author @entity41 in @entity41 's book , " we killed : the @entity50			1
" " i was talking about my mother , desperate to get my sister and me married			0
i was talking about my gay friend mr. @entity53 , and you just did n't talk about that			1
it sounds so tame and silly now , but my act spoke to women who were n't able to talk about things			1
" initially , @entity5 wanted to be an actress , and took up temp work while she pursued her goal			0
but when a fellow secretary pointed out that she could get paid for all the jokes she was landing around the office , @entity5 tried her hand at comedy			1
" i had no idea what i was doing			0
the white men were doing ' mother - in - law ' and ' my wife 's so fat ... ' jokes , " @entity5 recalled in a 2012 @entity75 essay			1
" when i went onstage , that just did n't feel right			2
so i just said , ' let me talk about my life			2
' " rivers : a pointed , pioneering comedian she was n't alone : @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 -- classic comedians who were then on the rise -- all mined their personal lives for laughs			1
but although they were " coming up at the same time " as she was , and had similar instincts about humor , @entity5 still did n't quite fit in			2
" i never was one of the guys , " @entity5 wrote in @entity75			0
" i was never asked to go hang out ; i never thought about it until later			0
they would all go to the @entity94 afterward and talk			2
i never got to go uptown and have a sandwich with them			0
so , even though i was with them , i was n't with them			2
" and maybe all the better for it			0
once she got her big break in 1965 on @entity103 's " @entity102 , " @entity5 made a name for herself as a woman who would talk frankly and freely about what that meant			1
the female body , her sex life , the politics of dating and relationships -- everything was fair game , and she saw no need in putting anything delicately			0
a 1967 appearance on " the @entity118 " might seem dated with its references to the single life , but @entity5 ' indignation at the disparity between men and women is righteously honest ( and , honestly , not that out of place with today )			2
" the girl has to be the one that 's bright , and pretty , and intelligent , a good sport -- ' @entity133 's again , hooray , hooray ! ' " @entity5 sarcastically pantomimed to the audience 's delight			0
" it just kills me ! a girl , you 're 30 years old , you 're not married , you 're an old maid			0
a man , he 's 90 years old , he 's not married , he 's a catch			0
it 's a whole different thing , is n't that so ? " she asked , as the audience applauded			2
@entity1 : @entity143 mourns a friend that chatty style made @entity5 an obvious pick for her own talk show , and she proved it as @entity103 's guest host and frequent stand - in on " tonight			1
" it was there , as one @entity156 critic proclaimed , that she could be " the bitchy queen of late night whose humorous bark left bite marks			0
" after shifting perceptions through @entity103 's show , @entity5 stepped out on her own in 1986 with " @entity164			0
" the program only lasted for eight months , but it nonetheless broke the rules ; @entity5 was the first woman to command her own late night talk show , and is still to this day one of the few women who 've broken into late night tv 's notorious boys club			1
" you have to be extraordinarily strong without them seeing you be that , " @entity5 told @entity0 of her experience in late night in 2013			0
" you 're a lion tamer			0
you have to be in total command , but you still have to be feminine , and you still have to be funny , and you still have to be inquisitive -- it 's a very tough thing , and it 's tough for women because you do n't expect a woman to take control			1
from @entity183 , who 's ending a top run on @entity185 to build something new at @entity187 ; to @entity32 , who just earned her first @entity189 nod for her @entity191 show ; to media titans like @entity193 and @entity194 -- the women who followed @entity5 have n't all been as controversial , but they have all shown traits of her dogged persistence			1
opinion : @entity1 gave misfit girls a permission to dream @entity30 is perhaps one of the most shining examples			1
like @entity5 , @entity202 has a talent for nailing celebrities to the wall with a smile , while simultaneously flaying herself			0
nowhere was that more evident than her @entity189 - winning reality show , " @entity30 : my life on the @entity212 , " a self - deprecating examination of how @entity202 was trying and failing to climb the @entity143 ladder			2
it 's not hard to imagine that if @entity5 had been born a few decades later , she would 've made a similar show			0
( after all , @entity5 kept working hard right up until her passing , starring in reality shows with her daughter , @entity223 , and gleefully torturing celebrities on @entity185 's " @entity225			0
" ) reflecting on rivers in the comedian 's 2010 documentary , " @entity227 , " @entity202 summed up the late legend 's impact thusly : " much in the way that @entity232 paved the way for her , " she said , " i would n't be doing this if it was n't for @entity1			1
