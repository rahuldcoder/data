the high court last year narrowly upheld the key funding provision of the health care law , a blockbuster ruling affirming that most @entity4 would be required to purchase insurance or pay a financial penalty -- the so - called " individual mandate			1
" the constitutional debate now shifts to the separate employer mandates and whether corporations themselves enjoy the same first amendment rights as individuals			0
