@entity0 , @entity1 -- whether the prosecution will seek the death penalty in @entity8 hot - car death case will be decided in two to three weeks , @entity4 district attorney @entity3 said thursday			1
@entity3 ' statement came hours after the @entity1 father was indicted by a grand jury on eight counts , including malice murder and two counts of felony murder			1
" we 're pleased with the pace and thoroughness of this investigation , which continues on today , " @entity3 said			0
" the evidence in this case has led us to this point today			0
whether it leads us to anyone else remains to be answered			0
" the next step will be to put @entity8 ' case on @entity30 judge @entity29 's arraignment calendar , which should happen within three weeks , the prosecutor said			1
motions will then be filed before the case goes to a trial calendar			0
@entity3 declined to take questions or comment further , saying , " this case will be tried in a court of law , " and not in the media			0
if @entity3 seeks the death penalty , it will be for the malice murder charge , which alleges that @entity8 , who has claimed his son 's death was an accident , premeditated the child 's killing			1
@entity8 ' attorney , @entity46 , called the charges excessive , describing them as a part of the " state 's maze of theories			1
" " it was always an accident			0
when the time comes , and we 've worked through the state 's maze of theories at trial , it 's still going to be a terrible , gut - wrenching accident			1
and all the eccentricities and moral failings of @entity65 ' life is n't going to change that , " he told reporters			0
the other five charges @entity8 faces are : first - degree cruelty to children , second - degree cruelty to children , criminal attempt to commit a felony ( sexual exploitation of a minor ) and two counts of dissemination of harmful material to minors			1
according to the indictment , the grand jury found that on june 18 , @entity8 " did unlawfully , and with malice aforethought , cause the death of @entity85 ... by placing said @entity85 into a child car seat and leaving him alone in a hot motor vehicle			1
" the two felony murder charges allege that @entity8 killed his 22 - month - old son while committing the felonies of first - and second - degree cruelty to children			1
one count states he killed @entity85 " maliciously , " while the other felony murder count says @entity8 killed him " with criminal negligence			1
" @entity8 faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison if convicted on any of the murder charges			1
by leaving @entity85 in the car , @entity8 caused the boy " cruel and excessive physical pain , " the cruelty to children charges allege			1
the criminal attempt to commit a felony and dissemination of harmful materials charges are not related directly to @entity85 's death			1
they involve allegations that @entity8 requested a nude photo of a minor 's genitalia and sent the same minor descriptions of " sexual excitement and sexual conduct , " according to the indictment			2
a @entity4 detective testified at an earlier probable cause hearing that while @entity85 was in the car at his father 's workplace , @entity8 was sexting with numerous women and sent one of them , who was underage , a photo of his erect penis			1
@entity8 pleaded not guilty to murder and child cruelty charges in june			2
@entity4 chief magistrate @entity132 signed off on the charges , stating @entity8 would 've had to notice that " the stench in the car was overwhelming " when he got in it as he left work and " drove it for some instance " before stopping to check on the boy			2
charges filed in an indictment supersede the previous charges			0
@entity8 has been held without bond since @entity85 's death this summer			1
authorities have painted @entity8 as a terrible father who , after admittedly looking up online how hot a car needed to be to kill a child , purposely strapped his son into his sweltering suv to die			1
his motivation ? the prosecutor has characterized @entity8 as an unfaithful husband who wanted a childless life			2
@entity46 has argued his client tragically forgot his child in the car			0
friends described @entity8 as a doting dad , not a malicious one , who loved to show off his blond , bright - eyed boy and talked about him incessantly			2
it all started simply enough : @entity8 left home with @entity85 in a rear - facing car seat in the back of his 2011 @entity166 , then headed to his job as a web developer for @entity170 - based @entity169 after making a quick stop at a fast - food restaurant for breakfast			1
but he did n't follow through on his routine of stopping to drop the boy off at daycare			0
instead , according to a criminal warrant , @entity8 drove to work and left @entity85 strapped in his car seat			1
he went back to his suv during lunch , put something in the car , then returned to work			0
all the while , the vehicle got increasingly hotter , with records showing the temperature topped 92 that day -- which can make the heat inside a closed vehicle soar past 100 degrees quickly			0
sometime around 4:15 p.m. , seven hours after he 'd arrived at work , @entity8 got back into his @entity191 and left work			2
witnesses told police that , soon thereafter , they heard " squealing tires ( as ) the vehicle came to a stop " in a shopping center			0
@entity4 police detective @entity198 testified at the probable cause hearing that @entity8 got out of the car yelling , " @entity201 , what have i done ? " he then stood with a blank look , going to the other side of his suv to make a phone call after someone told him that his son needed @entity208 , a witness told police , according to @entity198			2
witness @entity211 testified that , upon leaving a restaurant , he noticed @entity8 was distraught and crying			2
" he was hollering , " @entity211 testified , recounting the father saying , " oh , my @entity201 ! oh , my @entity201 ! my son is dead ! " @entity8 had to be physically restrained once it became clear @entity85 would n't make it -- at which time it was 88 degrees -- according to police			1
leaving his son alone in the car was n't the only thing @entity8 did that day , authorities say			2
while at work , he messaged six women besides his wife and exchanged explicit texts with some of them -- including the lewd photo that he sent to an underage female , @entity198 testified			0
yet even after these allegations surfaced , his wife @entity230 stood by her man			0
she sat calmly through the probable cause hearing , and at @entity85 's funeral flatly insisted she was " absolutely not " angry with her husband			2
" @entity65 is and was and will be , if we have more children , a wonderful father , " @entity230 said at the funeral in @entity237 , @entity238 , a gathering that her husband also addressed via phone from the @entity241			0
" @entity65 is a wonderful daddy and leader for our household			0
@entity85 meant the world to him			0
" given the district attorney 's comments thursday about whether anybody else will be charged in connection with the case , the attorney for @entity230 said he was surprised @entity3 was still contemplating charges			1
" i am surprised that the district attorney is still contemplating after almost three months of reviewing the evidence whether or not to charge my client , if that is who he was referring to in his press conference , " attorney @entity255 said			2
" by now , i would think they would have been able to make a final decision and clear her from any wrongdoing			0
" @entity2 's @entity265 and @entity266 reported and wrote from @entity170 , with @entity267 and @entity268 reporting from @entity0			0
@entity2 's @entity269 and @entity270 contributed to this report .			0
