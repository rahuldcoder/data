@entity0 -- olympic gold medalist @entity2 has acknowledged he engaged in " regrettable " behavior and " demonstrated bad judgment , " after a @entity6 newspaper published a photograph of the swimmer smoking from a bong			1
sports attorney @entity10 thinks @entity2 should speak to public about his opposition to drug use			1
@entity10 , a sports attorney and @entity15 talk show host , on monday spoke to @entity16 on @entity1 's " @entity17 " about how the incident could affect @entity20 ' career			1
@entity16 : what was your reaction to news of this picture of @entity2 surfacing ? @entity10 : the thing with @entity2 is , he 's not only been an outspoken athlete against drugs so he 's done a lot of testing , he 's been supportive of @entity32 , which is the @entity32			1
but he 's really a guy of high character			0
so you look at this , and my first thought was , " what about his endorsement deals ? what 's going to happen in those ? " a lot of endorsement deals have clauses that say that you ca n't do bad actions like this , not only crimes , but just things that you do bad in public could result in the termination of your contract			2
so he could lose a lot of money on this			1
@entity16 : now he never really admitted to smoking marijuana			0
... the @entity57 is n't going to sanction him , it looks like , but did call his actions disappointing			0
but to the greater issue that you were talking about , in terms of his endorsement deals , do you think anybody is going to say , well , this is the straw that broke the camel 's back with this guy ? he had one incident back in 2004			0
but are you going to dump @entity2 because of this picture ? @entity10 : it could happen , and the reason why is because a lot of these companies that are sponsoring him really are focused on kids and how actions of their athletes affect children			1
so that can be a big problem			0
the other thing is , unlike an athlete that plays sports every year in the public spotlight , the @entity85 for swimmers comes only every four years			1
so he does n't have that chance to rehabilitate his image immediately like a lot of other athletes , a basketball player or a football player would			2
so companies might say , you know what , let 's not work with @entity2 right now , because he does n't really have a chance to redeem himself			1
a picture says a thousand words , and how can he fight that ? @entity16 : how could you turn this around ? if you were his attorney , if you were advising him what would you do ? @entity10 : the first thing i would suggest is a drug test			1
and i know that that 's not required			0
and i also know that he 's not really going to have a problem with swimming in 2012			0
but i would just show that hey , i 'm clean , i 'm doing great			0
the next thing i would do is go out there in the public and talk about the troubles with working with drugs and really show the public that you are not about drug use , you are not about doing bad things in public			2
you are only about supporting the rules of @entity32 , the @entity32 , and supporting their drug testing program			2
so you can show that , hey , this is a minor incident , not a big deal			0
and really what it 's all about is remaining clean			0
@entity16 : if you were to lay a bet , would you say anybody drops him ? @entity10 : i would say he 'll have some problems			1
i do n't know if i would say that a big sponsor would drop him , but i would say that a more wholesome - oriented sponsor might .			2

@entity2 could lose a lot of sponsor money , attorney says
newspaper has published photo of @entity85 swimmer using a bong
attorney @entity10 would advise @entity20 to get drug test
