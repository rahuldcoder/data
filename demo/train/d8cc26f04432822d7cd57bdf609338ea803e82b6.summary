editor 's note : @entity2 worked as a staffer for former house speaker @entity4 and other @entity5 in @entity6			1
he is president of @entity7 , a @entity8 - based advocacy firm that has represented clients including @entity10 , @entity11 and the @entity12			2
he formerly was a government relations executive vice president for the @entity13			2
@entity2 says republicans are poised to bounce back for several reasons			1
( @entity21 ) -- " it is important for us to have a strong @entity5 , " @entity16 speaker of the house @entity17 tauntingly told a press conference on april 23			1
" and i hope that the next generation will take back the @entity5 for the @entity5 that it used to be			1
" thanks mrs. @entity17 , for your best wishes			0
but be careful what you wish for			0
i would n't write the obituary for the @entity5 quite yet			1
sure , things are looking grim at the moment			0
yes , our @entity5 chairman @entity30 stumbled out of the starting gate , making several verbal gaffes , and raising questions about his competence			1
yes , the latest poll numbers are in the toilet , showing only 21 percent of the @entity39 people call themselves @entity5			1
yes , @entity40 decided the @entity5 was a drag on his personal political future			1
and yes , we lost a special election in @entity44 that maybe we should have won			0
remember a year - and - a - half ago , when everybody thought the election would be a referendum on the @entity50 war			0
remember 10 months ago , when everyone thought that expensive gas was going to drive people to the polls			0
it turned out that , by the time of the election , the most important thing that people cared about was their declining 401ks or their lost job			0
here are five reasons why the @entity5 will be back and perhaps sooner than anyone thinks : 1 ) @entity63 : several of my @entity16 friends over the last several months have tried to comfort me when discussing the fall of the @entity5 with one consoling thought : do n't worry , we will screw it up			1
and on that one thing i agree with them			0
the @entity72 that currently run the @entity6 are destined to overreach on the legislative front			0
@entity17 and her @entity75 allies , like @entity76			0
@entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 , tend to think the rest of @entity39 wants the same things they do , from higher taxes on energy to a national health care plan that could be a blueprint for socialized medicine , from abortion on demand to gay marriage			1
but most @entity39 actually look at @entity75 as an economic basket case and social mess			1
it is a beautiful state , but it is also completely screwed - up , thanks largely to liberal governance			0
the @entity72 are certain to overdo it on the liberalism , and that will make the @entity5 much more attractive in two to four years			1
2 ) checks and balances : unlike the parliamentary governments of @entity101 , where one party runs everything until they mess up , the @entity39 system actually gives a preference to both parties having skin in the game			1
while most voters do n't actually think " divided government " when they go to the polls , they do think that one - party government tends to lead to excess and corruption			1
that is why the people have a chance a mere two years after the president gets elected to give him a midterm report card in the form of congressional elections			0
most polls now show voters prefer a candidate who will serve as a check on president @entity130 's power			0
and for most voters , who see @entity17 and @entity133 sen. @entity132 as even more liberal than the president , @entity5 will serve as that check			1
3 ) crisis breeds renewal : when things are going well , a political party tends to discourage independent thought and enforce philosophical orthodoxy			2
but when a political party faces crisis , all of that goes out the window			2
it is a wide - open world right now for republicans as they debate amongst themselves what the party truly stands for			2
the debate will be painful , as neoconservatives , paleo - conservatives , progressive conservatives , moderates and libertarians battle it out to chart the course for a new and more vibrant party			2
republicans can afford to have these debates now when they are in the minority , because frankly , they have nothing else to do			0
the @entity72 went through this process in the mid- 90s , and they built a new party that attracted centrists like @entity166 , without alienating old - line liberals like @entity17 or @entity77			2
4 ) talent senses opportunity : investors know that the time to buy is not when the market is at its peak , but when the market is at the bottom			0
but it is not always easy to know when the bottom hits			0
in politics , it is pretty easy to know when a party has hit the bottom			2
and for the @entity5 , it is now			1
talented political entrepreneurs look to the @entity5 and see nothing but opportunity			1
the old bulls have been wiped out			0
the new guard is ready to start leading			0
in the @entity192 , young guns like @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 are charting the future for the next @entity5 takeover			1
@entity195 of @entity196 and @entity197 of @entity198 are getting ready for state - wide runs			0
but it is not just the young guns			0
it also more experienced politicians , @entity203 and @entity204 of @entity205 , @entity206 of @entity207 , @entity208 of @entity196 , who see an opportunity to lead the party back to power			1
5 ) the @entity5 is the de facto @entity212 : most people i talk to think of themselves not as @entity5 or @entity72 , but as libertarians			1
not libertarians in the political party sense , but libertarians in a deeper philosophical sense			2
they tend to want government to stay out of their lives as much as possible			0
they tend to distrust all politicians , and when they hear someone say , " i am from the government , and i am here to help , " they tend to laugh uproariously			0
it was @entity230 who said , " i do n't make jokes			2
i just watch the government and report the facts			0
" the @entity5 does best when it seeks to reform government , to lessen the power of the bureaucrat , and to fight to give more freedom to the people			1
when the @entity5 returns to that philosophical creed -- which it will do in the face of the @entity130 administration 's vast expansion of government power -- its fortunes will brighten again			1
if the @entity5 were a stock , the smart investor would start buying it now			2
yes , things look grim at the present time , but things change			0
the @entity5 is not dead yet , and speaker @entity17 may see her wish of a resurgent @entity5 come true quicker than she anticipated			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : the @entity5 is struggling , but is n't dead
he says there are five good reasons to think the @entity5 will bounce back
@entity39 system is designed to *provide* checks on the *majority* party , he says
@entity5 are in position for creative thinking about ideas , @entity2 says
