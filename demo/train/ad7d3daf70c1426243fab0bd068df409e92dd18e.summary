-- more than a week after the grand jury 's decision in @entity4 , protests continue nationwide			1
on campuses , in malls , on streets and in stadiums , @entity5 young and old are voicing their anger about the non-indictments in the deaths of @entity13 and now @entity14 in @entity15 -- and about the rigged system that makes such results all too common			2
this proliferation of protests is good			1
but it 's not good enough			2
first , let 's reflect a bit on why it 's good			2
anytime @entity5 start seeing themselves as more than mere consumers or spectators -- rather , as citizens and participants -- something healthy is happening			2
that 's especially true when people are willing to flex their citizen muscles during the start of peak shopping season			2
so seeing protesters from @entity34 to @entity15 engage in civil disobedience on @entity36 was heartening			2
did all the walk - outs and " die - ins " inconvenience some shoppers and deal - seekers ? sure			0
the @entity43 moment demands , at a bare minimum , that we all raise our sights beyond one - day sale tags			0
but while the protests are promising and necessary , they are also insufficient			1
a deeper phase of work is needed			0
and here all of @entity5 can learn from what 's already been happening in @entity54			1
the media has tended to focus on the most eye - catching conflict -- either daytime marches with famous activists , or nighttime rioting after the grand jury decision			0
but off - camera , people on the ground in and around this community have been doing something simple and difficult			0
they 've been moving from protest to power			1
faith groups and grassroots organizers like @entity71 and the @entity72 have , since this summer , been engaging people in @entity4 to organize and advocate for reforms , to register , to vote , to understand the makeup and the methods of the city council and the state legislature			1
in short , to do politics			0
this may seem unsatisfying to some , even irrelevant			0
the members of the millennial generation who are driving so many of the protests today are idealistic and networked -- but also exceedingly cynical about traditional politics and government			1
and young african - americans who are most often subjected to arbitrary abuses by the criminal justice system have the most reason to be mistrustful of the larger political machinery that begat that system			1
but what the grassroots organizers in @entity4 teach us is that there is no avoiding politics			1
indeed , there is no way to achieve any scaled and durable reform without stepping into the arena of government , policy , politics , and elections			0
a change in city council representation can lead to a change in how truly representative one 's police force is			0
a well - coordinated campaign to let elected officials know you are part of a collective with voice , clout , savvy , and votes can lead to a change in attitude among those elected -- and then to changes in policy			1
what this requires is an understanding of the institutions that govern how we govern ourselves			0
what it requires is literacy in civic power			2
this is why the organization i run , @entity134 , is working with partners around the country to teach people about the skills and systems of power			2
and it 's why everyone , left or right -- and especially those living on the front lines of racial disparity and violent inequity -- must learn how to read and to write power			1
wherever you live , ask yourself : could i teach someone what the activists in @entity4 are teaching people now ? could i teach them how my city makes policy , how politicians respond to public pressure , how to navigate the rules of voting , how to make votes cancel out money ? @entity164 , from @entity165 a few years ago to @entity166 today , we see young people caught up in what one journalist called " the euphoria of defiance			1
" alas , in most of those situations , we also see what happens when protesters are unable to convert civil disobedience into civil self - rule			0
it requires patient instruction in citizenship			0
fifty - nine years ago this week , @entity184 made a heroic choice not to sit at the back of the bus			1
but what her story teaches us is this : heroes are what happens when a moment calls forth people well prepared by institutions			2
@entity184 did not arrive randomly at that occasion on that bus			1
she had been groomed by an ecosystem of civil rights groups like the @entity200 , trained at places like the @entity202			0
she had understood her choice -- her immovable defiance -- to be part of a larger story and a methodical strategy for the attainment of power			1
this is what unsung but undaunted citizen organizers and educators are doing in @entity4 today			1
they 've moved past " @entity214 , do n't shoot " gestures			0
they are getting hands - on about changing their community			0
and so should we all			0
that 's how we can make this a season of powerful citizenship .			0

@entity226 : protests over @entity4 are promising , but also insufficient .
everyone , left or right , must learn how to read and to write power : @entity226
