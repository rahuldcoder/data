-- every few years , the @entity1 releases its new @entity2 , which feature a barrage of seemingly embarrassing statistics that detail just how much @entity5 do n't know about science			1
the latest such report , out friday , has caused a stir by revealing that just 74 % of @entity5 know the @entity10 revolves around the sun. on the surface this figure may seem troubling , but we can take ( some ) heart : aside from serving as instant fodder for the news media , quizzing the public tells us little about the state of science literacy in the @entity5			1
science literacy is n't remembering a bunch of facts			2
it 's an appreciation and understanding of the scientific process and the ability to think critically			0
a lot of smart people get scientific facts wrong , and it does n't mean they are uneducated			1
in the 1987 documentary " a private universe , " @entity32 students , faculty and alumni were asked what causes the four seasons			0
nearly everyone interviewed incorrectly explained that seasons change when the @entity10 gets closer or farther from the sun in orbit rather than because of the tilt of its axis			0
it 's also important to remember that in polling , the way a question is phrased can influence the outcome			0
for example , the @entity1 's indicators report found that fewer than half of @entity5 agree with the statement , " human beings , as we know them today , developed from earlier species of animals			1
" however , a 2009 @entity59 poll reported that six in 10 @entity5 agree that " humans and other living things have evolved over time due to natural processes			1
" the same year , a @entity63 reported that while just 29 % of @entity5 agree that " human beings evolved from earlier species , " 53 % of the same pool of respondents " believe @entity65 's theory which states that plants , animals and human beings have evolved over time			1
" in other words , language matters			0
still , one ca n't simply dismiss the @entity2 data , in light of the very real problem the country faces : the state of science literacy has been in steep decline for a half - century			1
after @entity82 , the @entity5 celebrated scientists for developing crucial wartime technologies from radar to the hydrogen bomb			1
by 1957 , the @entity88 launch of @entity89 sparked tremendous growth in scientific funding for research and development			2
back then , scientists were heroes and worked closely with presidents @entity95 and @entity96			2
the space race faded to memory , and nonmilitary science funding dipped			1
@entity2 lost its prominence in policy , and today it 's treated as a special - interest group rather than central to the policymaking process			0
the emergence of the religious right beginning in the late 1970s created unnecessary battles pitting religion again " reason , " as if we must choose a side			0
more recently , budgetary constraints and the transforming media environment led to major cuts in science reporting			2
these days , most " science stories " that make the news are focused on diet and fitness instead of the latest research that will affect our lives and communities			0
meanwhile , the @entity124 allows us to shop for whatever scientific opinion we want as easily as we shop for holiday gifts			0
the result is a tsunami of dangerous misinformation and pseudoscience online fueling the rise of such things as the anti-vaccination movement and climate change denial			0
we need to shift course			0
it does n't matter whether every @entity5 can correctly answer a pop quiz about science topics he or she had to memorize in grade school			1
is n't that what turns a lot of us off to science to begin with ? what 's important is that we work to foster a more engaged @entity5 public that will not only support but also prioritize the research and development necessary to meet the 21st century 's greatest challenges , from drought to disease pandemics			1
one way ? enlist today 's young scientists entering the workforce as science emissaries -- training them with interdisciplinary skills that can be applied beyond academia			2
the number of traditional tenure - track jobs for science @entity162 is shrinking , even as we have a critical need for scientific expertise beyond the ivory towers			0
" @entity171 scientists " who pursue policymaking jobs , work as writers or even just speak another language will be best equipped to bridge the gap between science and society , serving as translators and communicators			2
we need this new generation of scientific heroes to restore science to its rightful place in @entity5			1
only then will we cultivate a culture of science literacy			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			2

@entity186 : survey shows many in @entity5 lack basic science *knowledge*
she says smart people can get science questions wrong and other polls show better results
but she says science *illiteracy* is a problem , and funding cuts , junk science have played role
writer : science graduates must bring science back into society in interdisciplinary ways
