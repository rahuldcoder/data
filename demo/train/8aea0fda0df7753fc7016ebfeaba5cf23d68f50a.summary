@entity0 , @entity1 -- want to make the ultimate superyacht entrance ? why not go by submarine through " @entity6 - style " doors ? or if you 'd prefer , take a helicopter ride then keep it stowed securely away in your very own on - board hangar			1
sounds far - fetched ? not at all			2
these feats are all possibilities on the @entity14 yacht			1
the 82 - meter vessel , with a price tag of more than â ‚ ¬ 110million ( $ 150m ) , is currently being built in @entity17			1
designed in conjunction with @entity20 and boat makers @entity21 , the ice class superyacht aims to be the ultimate luxury home on water			2
" this is a moving house , " says the director of @entity27 , @entity26			0
" but with this home , if you do n't like the neighbors , you can just sail away			0
" unlike submarines on other superyachts , passengers can access their six - man vessel via an internal docking station			1
" it has a @entity6 door that opens to the water , " explains @entity26			0
" then once in the submarine you can explore deep water			2
" the futuristic entrance shares the limelight with a helicopter hangar that can be compared to the @entity46 's garage			1
the hangar is accessed through opening hatches on the deck and an hydraulic lift			0
the hangar , which also comes equipped with a re-fueling system , means that the helicopter is protected from the elements and can stay on - board while the @entity14 yacht explores			1
this is a handy feature considering the vessel is capable of sailing in all kinds of water from the @entity62 to the @entity63			0
keeping in mind the boat 's ability to sail in waters across the globe , security has also been made a priority , the manufacturers say			0
water cannons and thermal imagery systems are in place in a bid to defend against potential pirate attacks			0
@entity14 is more than a year into construction , with building expected to be complete in around 18 months time			1
makers hope the yacht will be a keen sailor 's mega mansion on water , with room for offices kitted out with the latest in satellite technology and a classroom for the children			2
the owner 's apartment covers three decks and there 's a fourth deck for guests			0
in the public area there 's a piano salon , a cinema , a beauty salon , a fitness center and a private swimming pool			0
while luxury has been at the forefront of the minds of her makers , @entity14 has been designed with an environmentally - friendly focus			1
" we 've used the latest technology to make it as green as possible , " says @entity26			0
the hull 's shape and the medium speed diesel engine means the yacht produces low emissions			1
she also has a dynamic positioning system so that @entity14 can avoid anchoring in environmentally sensitive areas .			2

the @entity14 yacht is priced at more than $ 150m
it has its own helicopter hangar and six - man submarine
the yacht 's hull and engine are designed to emit low emissions
