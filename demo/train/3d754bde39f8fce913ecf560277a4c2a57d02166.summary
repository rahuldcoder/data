@entity0 -- as weekend temperatures soared over 90 degrees @entity2 , @entity0 saw a sudden increase in shootings , with 26 people felled by bullets in 72 hours -- seven fatally			1
" when we have hot temperatures , we see that the crime rate seems to go up , " @entity0 mayor @entity8 said monday			1
but @entity8 emphasized that for the year , shootings are down in the city -- 127 since january 1 , which is 40 less than the same period in 2012			2
" one shooting is one too many , but last week we had the fewest shootings in a decade , including this weekend 's shootings , " @entity8 noted			1
a professor says the heat index and the crime rate can connect			1
" lifestyle differences exist between cold weather and warm weather , " says @entity21 , a professor of @entity22 at @entity23 in @entity24			1
@entity28 has conducted research on the possible connection between temperature and crime			0
his findings illustrate how these lifestyle differences can contribute to varying levels of violent crime			1
" in cold weather , particularly in blizzards , people stay indoors , and the violent crime rate is lower			1
when the weather is warm , people are interacting more with others , be they friends , family , or strangers , so there are increased opportunities for conflict , " @entity21 says			2
@entity21 says this trend continues except when it gets incredibly hot , so unbearable that even criminals become lethargic			0
" when it gets to be in the high 90s , especially over 100 degrees , people just go indoors and look for air conditioning , " @entity21 said			0
however , drawing any conclusions about this past weekend may be premature , says professor @entity58 , assistant professor in the @entity59 , @entity60 , and @entity61 at @entity62			2
" i would not put too much emphasis on a single spike in weather and the uptick shootings , " @entity58 said			0
" the reality is that you do not have enough information from this single episode to conclude that hot weather is related to increases in crime -- specifically shootings , in this case			1
" in november 2012 , @entity0 logged a record - breaking " murder - free monday " when there was not a single reported slaying , stabbing , shooting or knifing in any of the five boroughs , according to the @entity79			2
" it is unusual in a city of 8 million people , but we never read that much into one day , " said deputy police commissioner @entity80 , who said it was the " first time in memory " that the city had such a lull in violent crime			0
at the close of 2012 , @entity8 hailed @entity0 the " safest big city in @entity92 , " giving the @entity79 credit			0
" the fact that the safest big city in @entity92 is safer than ever is a testament to the hard work and determination of the men and women who put their lives on the line for us every day -- and it also reflects our commitment to doing everything possible to stop gun violence , " @entity8 said			0
@entity1 's @entity107 and @entity108 contributed to this report .			0
