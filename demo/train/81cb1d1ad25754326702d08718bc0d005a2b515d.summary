@entity0 -- the cost of the @entity4 's newest fighter jet will be more than double the original price , solidifying the f - 35 joint strike fighter as the most expensive @entity4 weapons program ever			1
at a @entity10 hearing on thursday , the @entity4 's chief weapons buyers said numerous problems over the almost 10 - year program have forced the cost of the aircraft to go from $ 50 million a jet in 2001 to about $ 113 million			1
that cost overrun has also forced the @entity4 to justify the program to @entity18			1
outrage about the cost among the @entity22 panel was expected , including that from the chairman of the @entity24 , sen. @entity25 , @entity26			0
" this committee has been a strong supporter of the @entity31 program from the beginning , however , people should not conclude that we 're going to be willing to continue that strong support without regard to increased costs coming from poor program management , " @entity25 said			0
sen. @entity38 , @entity39 , the ranking member , had been pushing for a hearing on the program			0
" the taxpayers are a little tired of this , and i ca n't say that i can blame them , " @entity38 said			0
" it 's a bit frustrating to hear the secretary of defense as short a time ago as last august to tell us that everything is ok , " @entity38 said			0
@entity38 was referring to a visit to the joint strike fighter assembly plant last year where secretary of defense @entity51 said most of the high risk elements associated with @entity31 's developmental program were largely in the past , according to @entity38			1
the @entity4 wants to buy more than 2,400 of the technologically advanced aircraft			1
the f - 35 program has had numerous technical problems , delays and slow productivity over the years , including an entire program restructuring in an attempt to reduce the skyrocketing cost			1
@entity62 told the @entity22 panel that the program has fallen short on performance in the past few years			0
" that is unacceptable , " he said			0
despite that , the fighter jet program still enjoys strong support from service chiefs and congressional members because it touches numerous states			1
the f - 35 program cost overrun triggered the @entity75 law , which requires the @entity4 to tell @entity18 of significant cost increases			1
the law forces the @entity4 to justify continuing with the program			2
the @entity4 's director of cost assessment and program evaluation , @entity80 , told the senators she expects the @entity4 will officially notify @entity18 under the @entity75 regulation by april 1			2
the plane was designed to be the next generation fighter for the military and would have three variants			0
the @entity89 would have one for its carrier fleet , the @entity88 would use it to replace their aging harrier jump jet fleet and the @entity92 would use it as the service phases out the @entity95 and @entity96 fighter jets			2
the planes are being built by @entity98 , and the program also has international partners who have been building parts for the aircraft			2
more than 700 of them would be sold to those partner countries , including the @entity106 , @entity107 , the @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113			0
the fighter is the largest weapons program ever and @entity51 has been counting on it , as there are no immediate alternative programs to the @entity31			1
even with the delays and cost overruns , the first planes are expected to be put into service as early as 2012 for the @entity88			1
but the @entity92 and @entity89 are expecting their first aircraft to be delivered by 2016 , a two year delay for the @entity89 and a three year delay for the @entity92 , according to @entity4 officials			2
even as the program tries to field an aircraft in less than two years , a @entity128 ( @entity128 ) official testified at the hearing that there are still no final costs associated with the program through its projected life ending in 2034			0
" to date , the department does not have a full , comprehensive cost estimate for completing the program , " said @entity136 , director of the acquisition and sourcing management team for the @entity128 .			0
