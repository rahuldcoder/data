@entity1 , @entity0 -- in the developing world millions of people struggle to operate machinery , read from a blackboard , or just see the world around them , because they do n't have access to the eyeglasses they need			1
self - refraction glasses let the wearer adjust the lenses to suit their vision , without the need for an optometrist			1
but a pair of glasses developed by @entity21 , a physics professor at the @entity22 , offers an affordable solution			1
the glasses can be adjusted to the right strength by the wearer without the need to visit an optometrist			2
a major reason for that is a chronic shortage of optometrists -- in @entity34 , for example , there is just one for every eight million people			2
that makes it incredibly difficult for ordinary people to visit an optometrist , without which it 's impossible for them to get glasses			2
but @entity21 thinks he may have come up with a solution to the problem			0
his self - refraction glasses mean people can correct their vision without needing an optometrist ( see @entity48 )			2
" take a @entity50 country where there is one optometrist for every million people ; those people will never see an optometrist , so how will they get eyewear ? , " he told @entity2			0
" any model of delivery of vision correction in the developing world that depends on eye care professionals wo n't work			1
if you find a model that does n't rely on them , then you potentially have a solution			0
" @entity21 has been developing the glasses for over 20 years and continues to research the technology at the @entity68 in the @entity69 ( @entity70 ) at the @entity22			1
he told @entity2 that about 80 percent of those who try the glasses are able to correct their vision , but there are limitations			0
they ca n't be used to correct astigmatism and it 's not known if they are suitable for children , although the @entity70 is currently running a study to determine if schoolchildren can correct their own vision with their teachers ' help			1
so far , 30,000 pairs of self - refraction glasses have been distributed around the world , through an adult literacy program in @entity34 and the @entity87 and @entity88 ( @entity90 ) program			2
the man behind the @entity90 program was @entity93			0
he has now retired from the military and has set up @entity95 to distribute self - adjustable glasses			1
@entity93 has just returned from @entity97 , where he trained 40 people from local @entity99 to dispense the glasses			1
@entity93 sees charity organizations already working in developing countries as the key to distribution			2
" if i can train people from existing networks to dispense glasses , and they can spare one day each week or month to dispense the glasses , then they can see 50 to 100 people in a day -- and that 's a way to reach a lot of people , " @entity93 told @entity2			1
but for the program to be sustainable , @entity93 says the next step is to train his dispensers to become trainers themselves , so that he builds a growing network of people in developing countries who can distribute the glasses			1
silver estimates that one billion people in the developing world do n't have access to the glasses they need , and he has said that he would like to see all of them wearing glasses by 2020			1
but he is under no illusions that he can do it alone			0
" no one person or company can possibly deliver that many glasses by 2020			0
there 's a big infrastructure that needs to be set up to do that , and i 'd like to see it happen , " he told @entity2			0
distribution is one problem , cost is another			0
currently , it cost $ 19 to manufacture a pair of self - refraction glasses , and @entity21 acknowledges that the price needs to come down to a few dollars a pair to make them affordable			0
the glasses are currently functional , rather than fashionable , and that may limit their uptake , but more cosmetic versions are being developed			0
@entity21 says far more research is needed before those one billion people get their glasses , but he sees his self - refraction technology as a step toward that goal			1
he told @entity2 , " it 's one of the world 's largest problems			0
there 's an immense amount of interest in solving it and self - refraction is one route that can assist with that			0

a lack of optometrists means many in the developing world ca n't get glasses
@entity175 has developed glasses with lenses that can be altered by the wearer
the technology could be used to provide glasses for one billion people
@entity95 is training charity workers to dispense the glasses
