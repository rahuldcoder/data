-- for five years , @entity1 was the villain who stole just about every scene on " @entity3			1
" ( and he has the @entity4 to prove it			2
) he was such an important part of that landmark series that it only seemed to make sense that he ended up on the side of good , keeping watch on the island when it was all over			1
now @entity1 is on the island of @entity14 , filming " @entity15 , " one of the top dramas on television			1
on the @entity19 sci - fi procedural , @entity1 plays @entity20 , a mysterious genius whose creation , the machine , can predict crimes before they happen			1
this time , his character 's motives are more pure			1
@entity1 spoke to @entity0 about settling into this new role , an accidental visit to the set of " @entity30 " and his old friend from " @entity3 , " @entity32			1
@entity0 : now that you have a year under your belt , is @entity20 still a mystery to you ? @entity1 : he 's still a bit mysterious to me			1
i play it every day and i hope i play it well			2
i do n't have a very elaborate mental biography for him , i must say			2
i think he must evidently be a lot like me , because whatever my instincts are about the scenes tend to be the things that get used			2
@entity0 : would you describe him as a good guy at this point ? @entity1 : i do n't think his altruism is in doubt			1
if anything he has misgivings about the purity of his suicide mission for justice			2
@entity0 : with so many productions going on in @entity59 , i heard you had a run in with one of them			1
@entity1 : one day we were shooting downtown in the financial district			1
we just finished a scene and the company was breaking up to go to lunch			2
i do n't know if i stood and gabbed with somebody on the curb			2
next thing , i looked up and could n't find anybody from our company , and i guess i zoned out when they drove me there in the van because i could n't remember which direction i came from			2
i started walking and i got to another camp and it looked like ours			2
but it was another show			2
[ @entity82 ] i 'm sure they would have fed me			0
i think it was [ " @entity30 " ]			0
what if it were more surreal or absurd , where characters from " @entity15 " walked into " @entity89 " or something like that ? that 's a fun idea that has been completely unexplored			1
@entity0 : do you run into your old friend from " @entity3 , " @entity32 , who is shooting ( the now - canceled - but - still - in - production ) " @entity95 ? " @entity1 : it 's fun to have an old pal from the other island here on this island			1
he lives less than 20 blocks away from me			0
we get together every week or 10 days			1
it is a bit [ like old times ]			0
it 's just the setting is more urban and we 're much better dressed			1
we both have really nice clothes in the shows we 're doing now			0
@entity0 : what did you two have in common on " lost ? " @entity1 : to start with , we had age			1
we were both the oldest guys on that show			0
we had many more things in common : small town @entity116 backgrounds , and we both moved to big cities to pursue the unlikely dream of being an actor			0
we both ended up accidentally on a big series			1
we had some of the same work habits			0
we had so many things in common			0
we had a bunch of the best scenes on the series			1
it was good , intense , dark work and yet we had good laughs doing it			0
@entity0 : so you were a villain and now you 're a hero			0
@entity1 : i 'll stick with that			1
villains generally are more fun , but they 're hard to maintain			0
i guess anything is hard to maintain in tv land			0
i 'm happy that my character on " @entity15 " has enough ambiguity that it 's still compelling in that villain way , except he 's not			1
he does operate on the wrong side of the law so at least we have that			0
@entity0 : do you ever talk about projects you can do with your wife , @entity147 ( " @entity148 " ) ? @entity1 : we sometimes talk about plays we 'd like to do together			1
that shows how our minds work			0
i shot a few scenes with her on " @entity15 , " which was a great pleasure			1
we 'd never done tv work together			0
@entity0 : what about a guest spot on " @entity148 " ? @entity1 : i 'd be happy to do it , but i do n't think it 's ever going to happen			1
i ca n't go on there and play anything sinister because i 've kind of done that			0
i guess i could play an innocent			0
i 've said i 'd be happy to play a humble human who gets torn apart by supernatural beings			0
the characters i like on that show are the most ancient ones			0
i like thinking about how he looks like he 's 19 but he 's 2000 years old			1
@entity0 : and what was it like voicing the @entity173 in the " @entity175 " dvd movie ? @entity1 : if i knew how significant it was to play that role in that franchise , i think i would have been terrified when i took it			1
i must have been busy or distracted , because i went in there carefree			0
i had not seen these recent big screen " batmans			0
" that 's probably a blessing			2
later when i saw @entity185 , i thought " oh , @entity186			0
if i 'd have seen this , i might not have done it			0
" as it was , my only role model was @entity191 , and i thought , surely i can do as well as @entity191			0
@entity0 : did you get to laugh ? @entity1 : i did			1
it was a chance not to be repressed or contained			0
all the shows i do , it 's all about keeping a lid on it or staying small			2
when you play the @entity173 , the sky 's the limit			1
you can turn that thing up to 11			0
i know it 's a franchise where people have very high expectations and loyalties to whomever has played before , so i hope they 'll accept me .			2
