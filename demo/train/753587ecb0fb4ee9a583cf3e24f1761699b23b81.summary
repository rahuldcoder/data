hiking ! zip - lining ! rock climbing ! about 30,000 @entity0 and 7,000 adults are out in the mountains of southern @entity3 for the @entity4 -- and they all had to meet a body mass index cut - off			1
the @entity6 mandated that no one -- adult or child -- with a @entity10 of 40 or above could be accepted into the @entity4 , which is taking place july 15 - 24			1
this standard is not new ; it was in place for the last jamboree as well , said @entity15 , director of public relations for @entity6			0
" this policy is not meant to keep anyone out at all , and it 's just to make sure that they 're safe , " @entity15 said			0
" we offer thousands of summer camp experiences ( that ) do not have this requirement			1
" the @entity0 ' healthy living initiative has inspired children and adults alike to lose weight , @entity15 said			2
the association is encouraging people to live a healthy lifestyle			0
but that 's not how some see it			0
the @entity32 , a nonprofit organization , has come out against the @entity0 ' @entity10 policy , saying that the organization " believes that this decision promotes bias and negative attitudes and furthers the discrimination against boys of larger body size			1
" the organization publicly demanded in a statement that the @entity0 " reconsider their discriminatory practices and admit camp attendees not based on their physical fitness , not based on their body size , but based on their active status as a boy scout			1
" most who could not meet the @entity10 requirement chose not to apply , @entity15 said			1
the organization does not know the number of children impacted			0
the @entity0 have not received any reactions from parents on the @entity10 issue , he said			1
for prospective participants who have a slightly lower @entity10 than 40 , but are still obese , there are also special requirements for the jamboree , according to the @entity0 ' website			1
the jamboree 's medical staff needs a health history , health data and a recommendation from a personal health care provider for children with a @entity10 between 32 and 39.9 , which the @entity71 considers to be in the " obese " range			1
how to fix health problems with exercise even if the personal health care provider says there are n't any contraindications for participating , that does n't necessarily mean a person in this @entity10 range will be able to participate in the whole program , the @entity0 ' website says			1
people with a @entity10 of 31.9 or less need a medical recommendation , too , but do n't receive the additional health scrutiny			2
dr. @entity85 , a pediatrician in @entity86 and @entity89 's @entity88 expert , said she found the restrictions on children with a @entity10 of over 40 to be somewhat discriminatory			1
" any organization can make their own rules , but as a pediatrician i feel like we should be promoting physical activity for everybody , be as inclusive as possible , and only exclude from activity if there 's a physical threat to their health , " she said			0
on the other hand , she noted that in some summer programs there are physical activities involving equipment that has a weight or size limit for safety reasons			0
that should be a restrictive factor for those particular activities , she said , because of the danger to a participant who does n't meet the requirements			0
@entity10 is not a perfect indicator of health and fitness ; a @entity10 of 40 means that the person 's weight is much higher than average for his or her height			2
muscle can elevate @entity10 , so some fit people have higher bmis than normal			2
physicians group labels obesity a disease a @entity10 as high as 40 is unlikely to be mostly muscle , @entity85 said , but if there are health issues preventing that person from participating , she believes a doctor should determine that , rather than an organization making a blanket requirement			1
@entity85 does n't look at @entity10 alone when filling out medical forms for children to participate in summer programs			1
in addition to evaluating the kids ' health , she asks children how they perceive their own abilities in specific activities , such as rock climbing , and does n't give permission for anything with which the child does n't feel comfortable			0
the focus of the jamboree is not on the health requirements , @entity15 said			0
" our motto is : be prepared , " @entity15 said			0
" we 're the @entity0			2
we 've been preparing our participants for years for this			0
" @entity85 offered a different perspective : " in general , we 'd like to encourage physical activity for everybody			0
" in her view , that 's something the @entity0 are not honoring			2
