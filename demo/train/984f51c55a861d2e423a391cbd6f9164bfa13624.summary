-- for a preview of the next big thing in video gaming , look no further than the @entity4 , the splashy industry showcase that kicks off monday in @entity6			1
will it be the oddly named @entity8 , @entity10 's attempt to update its aging @entity8 console for a new wave of gamers ? or " @entity14 , " the next chapter in the massively popular sci - fi action series ? or maybe a surprise device or game that comes out of nowhere to captivate attendees ? this year 's @entity4 , as the annual trade show is better known , arrives during a time of upheaval for the multibillion - dollar gaming industry , which is scrambling to adapt to changing consumer habits			1
while home console gaming remains huge , more and more people are playing casual or social games on touchscreen phones and tablets			2
" i think we may be seeing the last generation of dedicated handheld gaming systems with the @entity36 and @entity37 , " said @entity30 , co-host @entity32 's " x-play			2
" " what we 've seen is the mobile gaming space really take over what used to be considered the handheld gaming market			2
" many analysts , including @entity30 , think this year 's @entity4 wo n't have as much bang as previous shows			1
@entity30 said he thinks this is because of expectations for next - generation consoles being developed by @entity48 and @entity49 for release in 2013 , and game developers ' hesitation to make something that might have a short shelf life			2
as an industry - only event , @entity4 is geared toward gaming media , developers and insiders			1
but in an effort to reach out to the public , many companies will be streaming events and shows throughout the four days of the conference to give fans early glimpses at new games and let them hear from developers directly			0
the @entity4 show floor does n't open until tuesday , although festivities begin monday with press announcements by @entity49 , @entity48 and several game developers			1
here 's a roundup of what to look for : the @entity8 , ready for its closeup most companies at @entity4 will be showing off what their existing hardware can do or emphasizing new video game titles			1
@entity10 is the only one of the @entity84 console makers -- a trio that includes @entity49 and @entity48 -- that will be demonstrating a new gaming system this year -- the @entity8 u. while the @entity8 was previewed in more primitive form at last year 's @entity4 , there have reportedly been some changes in how the console looks and what it can do			1
official word has been hush hush , which is typical for @entity10 before a big announcement			1
however , some images and news have leaked out suggesting the touchscreen controller for the @entity8 will be different from what was shown last year			1
there has been some confusion about whether the @entity8 is just a new controller or a more powerful console			1
@entity10 hopes to clear that up next week by demonstrating a " final " version of the system with games designed specifically for the @entity8 at last year 's @entity4 , @entity10 showed a @entity8 video demo featuring gameplay from @entity108 and @entity110 games			1
pricing remains a mystery for the @entity8 , which is expected to go on sale in fall 2012			1
in april , @entity10 chief executive @entity114 said a price for the new console would not be announced at @entity4 , but that the company would reveal its initial lineup of games			1
some industry analysts think @entity10 needs to announce a price at @entity4 to generate buzz for the console			1
new offerings for @entity36 and @entity125 some observers think the current lineup of consoles -- the @entity8 , @entity127 and @entity108 -- will all be replaced by newer systems by late 2013			1
" i think it is safe to assume this will be the last @entity4 where the current generation of consoles are talked about , " said @entity32 's @entity30			2
at @entity4 , both @entity48 and @entity49 will be focusing on new software for their current systems			1
@entity48 is expected to make a big push for games for its @entity36 handheld console			0
the new gaming platform , released in february , has been suffering from a lack of new content after its initial launch			0
critics have praised the @entity36 as technologically impressive but agree the device needs major game franchises to make it more popular			0
help may be on the way in the form of new @entity36 titles			0
" @entity151 , " a racing game featuring @entity153 , and " @entity154 , " a fighting game with some of @entity48 's top characters , are likely to be announced next week as part of cross-platform gameplay with the @entity127			0
there also have been strong rumors of a " @entity163 " game for the @entity36 to increase support for the console in @entity162			0
@entity49 will concentrate its e3 efforts on development for the popular @entity125 motion controller and additional games for the venerable @entity108			2
there also are rumors flying around that @entity49 will unveil a more refined recognition system for @entity125 , including the sensor 's ability to read individual finger movements			0
@entity49 also may announce new partnerships with tv broadcasters and programs in an effort to further transform the gaming console into a home entertainment center			0
currently , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 and others are part of the television lineup for the @entity108			2
big game titles on the software front for the @entity108 , " @entity14 " will be showcased in a four - hour event with its new developer , @entity191 , and the return of master chief as the main character			1
the game is due out in november			0
other exclusive , unannounced titles for the @entity49 console and @entity125 are also expected -- although some franchises may be holding out for a next - generation console in a year or so			0
while " @entity14 " is one of the biggest titles at @entity4 , it is far from the only hotly anticipated game			1
we hope to see more from " @entity205 " ( made by @entity206 ) and its setting in the @entity209 colonies , more from " @entity210 " ( @entity211 ) and its steampunk action , and more about " @entity213 " ( @entity214 ) and that game 's multiplayer / co-op modes			0
" there are a lot of great [ big - name ] games that are going to be there and be talked about , " @entity30 said			0
" but even the software is going to be a little less than what people expect because of the potential for next - gen consoles next year			2
" on the other end of the gaming spectrum , there are also plans for several new massive multiplayer online games			0
one , " @entity232 " ( @entity233 ) , features a unique tie - in with a new sci - fi tv series , where what happens on the show can affect what happens in the game			0
what we wo n't see at @entity4 for all the hype and excitement about @entity4 announcements , there are some notable titles and companies that are choosing to bypass this year 's event			1
the makers of " @entity250 , " one of the most highly anticipated games for 2012 , were originally scheduled to show off new gameplay and features			0
but the game 's release was pushed back to february 2013 , and creative director @entity256 said the next time people will see the game is when it 's ready to go in the box for delivery			0
" @entity262 , " the latest in the blockbuster urban action series , also may skip @entity4			2
@entity264 , developer for the game , said it has no plans for the show , although some watchers speculate that could change at the last minute			0
despite persistent rumors , @entity270 has said it does n't expect to reveal any new hardware -- or popular games such as " @entity274 " or " @entity275 " -- next week			0
but @entity270 does plan to attend @entity4 , and misdirection from gaming companies has been known to occur before the show			1
by next week at this time , we 'll know much more about the best gaming has to offer for the next 12 months			0
gamers , what are you hoping to see at @entity4 ? and what are you most looking forward to later this year ?			2
