-- @entity1 accidentally went live with a handful of prototype features earlier today , including a site - wide yet short - lived overhaul of @entity5			1
roughly 45 minutes after the mistaken update , @entity1 disabled the site , reverted back to its previous state and then tweeted apologetically about the downtime			1
but that brief span of time was enough for @entity1 members and page admins to get a sneak peak at new features in the works			1
@entity1 admitted to pushing features before their time			1
" also , some internal prototypes were exposed to people and resulted in us disabling the site briefly			0
it 's now back to normal , " read a tweet from @entity1			1
so what were those prototypes exactly ? screenshots shared with us and surfaced through other media outlets suggest all of the following : new @entity29 ( with @entity31 integration ) , a " @entity40 " feature for @entity33 , a new memories feature that chronicles photos and status updates from years past and an " @entity39 " filter for the @entity38			1
what follows is a deeper look at what some @entity1 users saw today			1
new @entity1 pages pages got a temporary facelift with a tab - free design -- the navigation instead being placed on the left - hand side of the page -- that more closely resembles @entity51 and member profiles			1
we also noticed that questions were integrated into the @entity5 experience and that @entity1 introduced a " @entity40 " feature for page admins			2
we initially thought it strange that new @entity29 would be released without an announcement from @entity1			2
commenters agreed ; many of you expressed displeasure at the idea that would @entity1 would overhaul pages without notifying you of the changes first			1
when pressed for clarification specifically around @entity5 , a @entity1 spokesperson shared the following statement : " while we are always experimenting with new features internally we are not making changes to pages right now			1
organizations invest a lot of time on their @entity29 because millions of people find them useful everyday			0
we remain committed to providing ways for @entity50 owners to customize and control the experience on their page			0
if we do make changes , we will provide partners with advance notice			0
" memories several users reported having access to a new " memories " option listed below @entity90 in the left - hand menu on their @entity92			1
a " @entity0 " commenter said of the feature , " i was online during the glitch and also saw a new memories link under my profile pic. it 's gone now but i did get a sneak peek while it lasted			0
it allowed you to look back at status updates , photos , and new friends ... giving a snapshot of each year i 've been on @entity1			1
" the " @entity108 " reporter @entity107 saw the memories option and described it in a similar fashion			1
" it showed options for jumping to photos grouped by years : 2010 , 2009 , 2008 , etc. with complementing information like status dated status updates , the number of friends added per year , events attended and @entity1 places check - ins , " she wrote			1
memories would make for a pleasant ( hopefully ) walk down memory lane , so we hope this features finds its way back to @entity92 in the near future			2
outside @entity125 we also found some evidence that @entity1 may still be testing a filter for the @entity38 called " @entity39			2
" twitter user @ casschin posted a @entity130 of the filter that shows the @entity38 with a most recent drop - down menu that includes " @entity39 " as a filter			0
" @entity137 " first unearthed the filter back in 2009 and speculated that it was an @entity136 - like option for the @entity38			2
at the time , " @entity140 " confirmed with @entity1 that the filter was for internal staffers only			2
we 're not quite sure to make of this one just yet			0
@entity141 several commenters have said they also saw the lightbox ui for @entity144 , albeit with a few bugs			0
the photo included here comes courtesy of " @entity0 " reader @entity149			0
the feature was first previewed when @entity1 upgraded @entity90 two months ago			2
" any time you click on an image anywhere on @entity1 , be it in an album or in your @entity38 or on a friend 's @entity158 , you 'll see a black box hovering over the rest of the screen with some minimal navigation controls and relevant social features , allowing you to concentrate completely on the image at hand , " said " @entity0 " reporter @entity151 at the time			1
removal of " @entity169 " @entity167 from @entity168 @entity1 may have pushed a premature update to comment boxes earlier today , according to @entity0 readers			0
readers are reporting that comment boxes temporarily mirrored those in the new @entity177 product and did not have the " comment " button			0
without the button , a user simply needs to hit the @entity181 to submit his comment			0
the screenshot above is merely a mock up , but these reports sound about right			0
@entity1 consistently updates older products to match the style of its newer ones			0
hat tip to @entity190 , @entity191 and the rest of our astute readers on this find			0
were you privy to these or other changes ? share your thoughts in the comments			0
