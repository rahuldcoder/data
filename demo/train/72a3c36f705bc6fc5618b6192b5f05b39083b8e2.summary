@entity0 , @entity1 -- a widespread shortage of organs for transplantation means surgeons are forced to use " less than ideal " organs -- a practice that can have deadly consequences			1
in october 2009 , the inquest into the death of @entity13 soldier corporal @entity12 revealed he had received a double lung transplant from a donor who may have smoked up to 50 cigarettes a day			1
less than a year after the transplant , @entity12 died after doctors found a tumor in his lungs			2
the case highlighted the fact that with a desperate shortage of donors , surgeons are often forced to transplant imperfect organs			1
@entity28 , vice-president of the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) , told @entity2 that 49 percent of last year 's lung donors in the @entity13 were smokers			1
" we 're not in the luxurious position in transplantation to turn down organs because they 're not absolutely perfect -- there are very few perfect organs , " he said			2
@entity28 told @entity2 that around 7,000 people in the @entity13 are currently waiting for a transplant ; according to @entity29 figures , almost 1,000 people died last year while waiting			1
in the @entity43 , about 105,000 people are currently waiting for an organ transplant , and approximately 19 people die every day while waiting for a transplant , according to according to official figures			1
@entity48 leads the world in organ donation , with 33 deceased donors per million people , compared with 12 donors per million in the @entity13 , according to @entity28			1
@entity48 has a " presumed consent " law , where individuals are automatically considered an organ donor unless they opt out , but @entity28 said that is not the only factor that explains the country 's high level of organ donation			1
he told @entity2 that @entity48 has a well - developed infrastructure for managing patients in intensive care and dedicated donor coordinators who are able to counsel the families of the deceased and discuss their consent to organ donation			1
it 's a system that has been trialled in the @entity13 for the last two years , and one that @entity28 hopes will improve donation rates			1
but with current levels of donation , @entity28 is happy to use the organs that are available			2
he told @entity2 that data shows that transplants using smokers ' lungs are just as effective in the long term as those using lungs from non-smokers			0
" in the case of corporal @entity12 , the donor had a chest x-ray , broncoscopy and a careful inspection of the lungs once they were removed , " @entity28 told @entity2			2
" when they found the tumor in corporal @entity96 it was seven millimeters across and it was likely to have been two or three millimeters when it was transplanted			0
to find something that small you 'd need to chop the lungs up into fine pieces , and then you ca n't transplant			0
" @entity28 told @entity2 that organs are thoroughly tested for suitability before they are transplanted			0
he said that once a patient has been diagnosed as brain - dead and donation is a possibility , a donor coordinator will approach their family to learn more about the patient 's history			2
medics ask about the donor 's medical history and lifestyle			0
they also take a blood test and may contact the donor 's doctor for more information			0
but @entity28 stresses that medics only have a few hours between diagnosis of brain death and organ removal			0
those time constraints mean medics have to make quick judgments about the suitability of donated organs			0
" we 're happy to use the organs available knowing they 're not ideal and we 'll make the best use of them and keep them functioning as well as we can , " said @entity28			0
" the alternative for recipients is to die , so there 's really not much choice for them			0

@entity48 leads the world in terms of organ donation , and employs donor coordinators in *hospitals* .
