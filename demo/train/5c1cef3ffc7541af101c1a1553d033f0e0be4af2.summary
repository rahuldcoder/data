-- almost every @entity2 ally in the @entity3 is desperately calling out for help , and we are ignoring them			1
@entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 -- and behind closed doors , even @entity14 -- want @entity2 involvement in @entity16 to stop the blood bath			1
but the twin ghosts of @entity19 and @entity20 seem to have paralyzed @entity2 in the @entity22 world			2
on thursday , @entity8 's prime minister , @entity23 , will visit president @entity24 in @entity25			1
this is an ideal opportunity to throw @entity2 weight behind greater @entity8 leadership in resolving the @entity30 conflict -- and declare as much from the @entity31			1
the conflict is spreading fast outside of @entity16 , and unless regional powers such as @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity11 are empowered to act militarily , and swiftly , many more lives will be lost and the @entity3 further destabilized			1
only this weekend , @entity35 's intelligence agencies were linked to two car bombings in @entity37 , @entity8 , that killed more than 50 people and injured more than 100			1
@entity16 is now home to radical @entity41 islamists from across the globe who want to bring down @entity35 , and @entity45 fighters from @entity46 who support the @entity30 president			1
beyond geopolitics and games of nation states , @entity16 is a raw human disaster : some 80,000 people have been killed , 1 million refugees have fled to neighboring countries , and millions more are displaced inside @entity16			2
for how much longer will we stand by and watch ? i oppose direct @entity2 military intervention in @entity16 , but recent actions by @entity9 , daring attacks on @entity8 and last month 's rapprochement between these two important nations means that there is now new scope for greater regional involvement in @entity16			1
secretary of state @entity65 is right to pursue a new diplomatic settlement through @entity67 , but his hand is only as strong as the force gathering on @entity35 's doorsteps			1
in other words , let us say yes to diplomacy , but not be @entity74 ve and think that @entity35 and his @entity76 backers can not outmaneuver the wiliest diplomats			2
they have rebuffed at least five other such attempts			0
diplomacy must be backed by force			0
@entity82 understands the language of military strength -- of armies keeping fighting factions apart , aircrafts enforcing a " no - fly " zone , bombs on his runways , tanks outside his presidential palace , ships on the seas			0
that is not to say that the killings continue			0
@entity23 has been sensitive when dealing with @entity98 terrorists in not killing them for fear of collateral damage			0
that same spirit of protecting human lives must inform @entity8 leadership in @entity16			2
first , @entity35 and his family need to leave @entity16 for @entity105 , @entity76 or elsewhere			2
their days of ruling like a mafia are over			0
large segments of the @entity30 people have lost their fear of @entity35 , and will not settle for anything less than his departure			0
he must either do so freely and immediately , or meet the fate of @entity115 and @entity116			0
second , @entity35 is not the protector of @entity16 's minorities , as many mistakenly believe			1
he is the cause of mass killings that are likely to get worse without external intervention			0
genocide of @entity16 's minorities will have a ripple effect on tribes and religious minorities in @entity19 , @entity127 and @entity10			2
@entity8 and regional and @entity129 forces should make it their utmost priority to prevent it			0
third , with all their divisions and sectarian pettiness , it is the @entity30 opposition that must own @entity16			0
@entity137 's admonition that " if you break it , you own it " can not be applied to outside countries with @entity16 -- the owners must be the @entity30 opposition ( with all its flaws ) , not @entity8 , far less @entity9 or @entity11 or others who " break " @entity35 's grip			1
fourth , removing @entity35 and safeguarding @entity30 communities is not the end , but a new beginning			0
@entity16 can go in any number of directions			0
the challenge from @entity152 radicalism and terrorism inside @entity16 is real -- they can be confronted there , and prevented from traveling elsewhere and spreading their virus of violence			2
as @entity16 works toward rebuilding its infrastructure , economy , society and polity , the @entity2 can not turn its back on a country that shares borders with @entity10 , @entity8 , @entity19 , @entity9 and @entity127			1
for now , @entity25 needs to respond to the calls of our allies in the @entity3 , and in doing so , bring @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity22 closer in cooperation as they seek to liberate @entity16 from the clutches of a corrupt clan and ensure it remains free from the fanatics of @entity152 fundamentalism			1
closer engagement by these three regional forces through @entity2 assistance now also puts in place roots for a post-al - @entity16 that is less hostile to @entity9			1
@entity2 does not need to lead always ; it can and must support its allies			2

he says when @entity24 meets with @entity8 's prime minister , he should back @entity8 taking lead
@entity184 : diplomacy needed , but @entity35 is wily , understands force
