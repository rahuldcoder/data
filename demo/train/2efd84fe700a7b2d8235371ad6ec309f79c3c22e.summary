-- scientists say a very rare find of some 20 fossilized pterodactyls has produced the first clear evidence of a controversial theory of evolution			1
this image shows the fossilized skeleton of @entity9 which was found in north - east @entity10 earlier this year			1
the fossils were found in northeast @entity10 earlier this year , embedded in rock dating back 160 million years , and have been called " @entity9 " after the renowned naturalist @entity13			1
the creature 's discovery has astounded scientists because their age puts them within two recognized groups of pterodactyls -- primitive long - tailed forms and advanced short - tail forms -- and they display characteristics of both			1
the combination of features indicates that the primitive pterodactyls evolved relatively quickly , and that certain groups of features changed at the same time			1
traditional evolutionary theory suggests that one feature -- a tail for instance -- would slowly evolve over time			2
" @entity9 came as quite a shock to us , " said @entity33 , from the @entity35 's @entity34 , which identified the creature , along with researchers from the @entity39 of @entity40			0
" we had always expected a gap - filler with typically intermediate features such as a moderately elongate tail -- neither long nor short -- but the strange thing about @entity9 is that it has a head and neck just like that of advanced pterosaurs , while the rest of the skeleton , including a very long tail , is identical to that of primitive forms , " he said			0
by comparing the fossil with others from earlier and later periods , scientists have been able to sketch a rough timeline of the pterodactyl 's progression			2
" the head and neck evolved first , followed later by the body , tail , wings and legs , " @entity33 said			0
the researchers say more study is needed to substantiate the idea of that evolution could occur relatively quickly , and that whole parts of a plant or animal 's body could change at once			2
the fossils indicate @entity9 was about the size of a crow , with long jaws , sharp , pointed teeth and a flexible neck			0
it had " hawk - like " qualities , scientists say , which allowed the creature to kill and eat smaller , feathered dinosaurs which would later evolve into birds			0
pterodactyls were prevalent during the @entity90 between 220 and 65 million years ago			1
the research has been published in the " @entity93 b : @entity94			0

researchers say rare fossil find provides evidence of one theory of evolution
20 fossilized pterodactyls found in @entity10 in rock dating back 160 million years
fossils show creatures had characteristics of two types of known pterodactyls
scientists say fossils show groups of features changed relatively rapidly
