when @entity1 , a @entity2 alumna , advised in an open letter that @entity2 coeds find a husband before they graduate , she provoked an avalanche of responses that span the spectrum from " good idea " to " no way			1
" so , what should young women make of her advice ? it turns out that we actually know a lot about the consequences of choosing a mate at an early age			2
most of it shows that , on average , delaying marriage confers a number of advantages to women -- and to men as well			1
research over the last several decades has repeatedly demonstrated that women who postpone marriage are less likely to divorce , more likely to attain economic stability for themselves and their children , and more likely to express satisfaction with their family and work commitments			1
even " @entity49 yet , " a recent report co-written by the @entity38 and concerned with the possible costs of postponing marriage , clearly shows that delayed marriage improves the socioeconomic prospects of women and their families ( especially among more privileged groups ) , reduces the chance of divorce and allows women to attain important life goals			1
opinion : if only i 'd snagged a @entity2 man it 's no mystery why this is the case			2
amid our post-industrial , hi - tech economy , it takes longer to gain the personal insights and occupational skills needed to make a successful transition to adulthood			2
it takes time not just to develop the practical knowledge needed to negotiate a rapidly changing world but also to gain a clear sense of purpose about one 's own life and about the kind of person one wishes to have as a life partner			0
in my own research , young women from diverse backgrounds consistently agreed , in the words of one of my respondents , that " you need to find out who you are first " before you are ready to choose a lifelong partner			1
this woman was the first member of her family to graduate from college			0
but whether they were graduates of an elite university or making their way through a community college while holding a full - time job , these young women were keenly aware of the challenges facing today 's relationships			0
they overwhelmingly hope to create a lasting marriage -- or " marriage - like relationship " -- in the long run			0
but they also believe the best chance of making a marriage work is to first establish their own identity and independence			0
as another young woman put it , as she discussed her plans to finish college and find a good job before settling down , " i want to be stable for myself , so i 'm not getting married prematurely			0
" these are just some of the reasons the average age at first marriage has been rising for several decades and now hovers around 27 for women and 29 for men			2
younger generations have concluded , accurately , that their options do not contract after schooling , that they can take time to develop their own identities and make important life commitments , and that it may make sense to wait			1
if the evidence supporting the option of delayed marriage is so strong , why has a letter urging women to choose a partner early garnered so much attention ? perhaps because , despite the crumbling barriers that have allowed women to enter the halls of once all - male enclaves such as @entity2 , so much remains unchanged			1
@entity1 never questions the norm that women should " marry up " -- and by extension , men should marry " down " -- on a variety of dimensions , including education , accomplishment and age			1
( nor does she question the assumption that mate choice is universally heterosexual , but that is a topic for another debate			0
) yet a thorough gender revolution means questioning such assumptions about how women ( and men ) select a life partner			2
genuine equality means jettisoning assumptions that all women should choose a partner who is older , more professionally accomplished or even more intelligent			0
the young women i have interviewed are far more likely to stress the importance of such criteria as mutual support , respect and love in a marital partnership			0
most of all , decisions about when and whom to marry are deeply personal , and advice that presumes " one size fits all " is more likely to trigger unnecessary anxiety than to offer useful help			1
instead of telling new generations what choices to make , we should turn our attention to creating the social supports and economic opportunities that will help them forge the more egalitarian relationships , satisfying work careers and work - family balance they desire , regardless of when -- and whether -- they marry .			0
