@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , a former high school teacher who served a month - long sentence for raping a 14 - year - old girl , was released thursday from a @entity1 jail			1
@entity3 's lenient sentence and the judge 's comments about his victim sparked national outrage and protests			1
he wo n't be a free man exactly ; he 's on probation for the next 14 years , 11 months			1
according to court documents , that means he 'll have to agree to conditions like undergoing sex offender treatment , not going to places where children congregate and not having a cell phone with photo , video or internet capabilities			1
prosecutors have appealed the sentence , saying it is illegal , to the @entity30			1
the victim 's mother says she hope @entity3 will be behind bars again soon			1
" ( judge g. @entity34 ) made a mistake and i 'm disappointed			0
( 31 ) days , that 's outrageous , but the @entity30 stepped in			2
hopefully they 'll make it right , " said @entity37 , whose daughter , @entity38 , committed suicide before @entity3 went to trial			1
in the meantime , @entity37 told @entity2 's @entity44 thursday night that she wants to avoid the man who raped her daughter			2
" i hope i do n't see him			0
that would be horrible , " she said			0
" i did n't see him for the first six years			2
i did n't see him until the courtroom			0
" but she said someday , she hopes she will be able to forgive him			1
" i could be miserable the rest of my life , " she said , " but that would n't do my other kids any good			0
" @entity3 declined to answer questions from @entity2 as he entered and left a probation office in @entity0 on thursday			1
defense attorney @entity60 had no comment on the case , but has said his client contends the sentence imposed is lawful and appropriate			2
before suicide , raped @entity1 teen loved outdoors , poetry activists file formal judicial complaint on tuesday , the @entity1 and @entity72 chapters of the @entity73 and an activist group called @entity75 filed a complaint with a judicial review board , @entity2 affiliate @entity70 reported			0
more than 140,000 people signed accompanying petitions , the groups said			0
" if we ca n't get him removed from this , there is something wrong with the system , and i know people in the state will work to not get ( @entity34 ) re-elected ( next year ) , " said @entity81 , president of @entity82			2
the case drew widespread attention when @entity34 imposed a one - month sentence on @entity94 and made controversial comments about the victim , saying she " seemed older than her chronological age " and she was " as much in control of the situation			1
" @entity3 admitted raping the girl in 2008 while she was 14 and he was her teacher at her high school			1
@entity38 took her life shortly before her 17th birthday			1
the judge later apologized for his comments , and earlier this month tried to revisit his sentence			2
but the @entity110 barred him from a new ruling , saying he did n't have the legal standing to change a sentence			1
@entity34 said he did n't realize at first that the minimum sentence should have been two years			1
@entity34 's secretary said wednesday the judge had no comment on @entity3 's release			1
' we want the conversation to go nationwide ' there is one good thing about the case , @entity73 's @entity81 said : it 's brought renewed national attention to the critically important issue of violence against women			2
" we want the conversation to go nationwide , so that everyone will say this behavior is not ok in my community			0
i think everyone believes , ' in my town it ca n't happen , it should n't happen , i need to stop it , ' " she said			0
" and you can stop it			0
you can stop it by going out and spreading the word			0
" that 's why she sees a glimmer of hope in how much people are talking about the case			2
" i think as long as we know that it 's happening we can acknowledge it and we can do something to change it			2
if we do n't see it and do n't acknowledge it , we ca n't make a change at all , " she said			0
" so i think this is important			0
this is so sad for the mother , this is so sad for the community , this is so sad for our state and our country			0
" the legal process with @entity38 's death , the prosecution entered into what is known as a " deferred prosecution agreement " with @entity3			1
this meant that all charges against @entity3 -- who admitted to one of the rape charges -- would be dismissed if he completed a sex - offender treatment program and met other requirements			1
one of them was to have no contact with children			0
but the ex-teacher fell short of the agreement and prosecutors asked @entity34 last month to sentence him to 20 years			1
@entity34 ruled @entity3 's infractions were n't serious enough			1
" he made some violations of his treatment program , " the judge said			0
" they were more technical and not the kind you would send someone to prison for			0
" @entity37 said the pain of her daughter 's death has n't faded			0
" i think we just get used to it , so we do n't cry every day , " she said , but the tears still came			0
opinion : in @entity1 , a case study in rape culture @entity2 's @entity203 and @entity204 contributed to this report .			0
