@entity0 -- by now , many @entity2 are used to getting random e-mails allegedly from " friends " with weird - looking links embedded in them , or what looks like @entity7 from fake companies inviting you to click on a link to reset your password			1
but what you may not know is that shady @entity16 practices could be playing a dangerous role in international cyber warfare			2
from @entity22 to @entity23 to the @entity24 to @entity26 countries in transition after the @entity28 , attacks launched from overseas against @entity2 companies and private citizens have now become a primary fear of the @entity2 government , according to the annual intelligence community 's worldwide threat assessment released tuesday			1
" threats are more diverse , interconnected and viral than at any time in history , " director of national intelligence @entity33 said in testimony prepared for the @entity36			1
report : cyberattacks a key threat to @entity2 national security " attacks , which might involve cyber and financial weapons , can be deniable and unattributable , " @entity33 said for tuesday 's hearing			1
" @entity46 can be invisible , latent and progressive			0
" the @entity36 committee is talking with @entity33 and other administration officials this week in an annual round of hearings on international threat assessments			1
cyber security firm @entity52 recently linked @entity22 to cyber espionage and attempts to steal @entity2 trade secrets			1
" we see two sets of attackers in broad groups			0
we have intruders who are nation states who conduct espionage			0
they 're going after as you mentioned trade secrets , information that they can use to improve their own companies back home			2
and we also see criminal groups , " @entity67 , chief security officer of @entity52 , told @entity68 on @entity1 on monday			0
national security adviser @entity70 also sounded the alarm in his remarks on monday to the @entity73 in @entity74			0
" increasingly , @entity2 businesses are speaking out about their serious concerns about sophisticated , targeted theft of confidential business information and proprietary technologies through cyber intrusions emanating from @entity22 on an unprecedented scale , " he said			1
" the international community can not afford to tolerate such activity from any country			0
as the president said in the @entity86 , we will take action to protect our economy against cyber-threats , " he said			0
the @entity90 signaled that cybersecurity would be a top priority during president @entity94 's second term			1

the order also seeks to shore up defenses of the critical infrastructure vulnerable to cyberattacks			0
@entity94 administration takes on hackers stealing trade secrets " we know hackers steal people 's identities and infiltrate private e-mail			1
we know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets , " @entity94 said during the @entity86 address			1
" now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid , our financial institutions , and our air traffic control systems , " he said			0
the president stressed the urgency of swift action			0
" we can not look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy , " he said			2
for instance , that link in an e-mail from a trusted friend could really disguise a malicious file or " bot " intended to steal your passwords , log all your keystrokes or ultimately put your bank accounts , personal details and other private information in the hands of cyber criminals or foreign governments			2
now imagine that happening thousands of times a day , every day of the year , all across the country			0
the effect could put broader networks and secure data at risk			0

cloud threats and firewalls : internet guru demystifies cyber security the response , seen in a 150 - page report unveiled by attorney general @entity165 and other leading government officials earlier this year , includes pledges by the @entity168 and @entity169 to crack down on hacking , a guide for corporations vulnerable to attacks on how to beef up their own security , and a proposal to better coordinate efforts with @entity2 allies to prosecute foreign hackers			1
" in this time of economic recovery , this work is more important than it has ever been before , " @entity165 said			0
" i am pleased to report we are fighting back more aggressively and collaboratively than ever before			0
" major banks hit with biggest cyberattacks in history @entity185 , @entity186 , the @entity187 and other media companies have all faced cyber attacks in recent years			1

" legislation aimed at regulating how businesses report and address cyber attacks failed in the @entity36 last year amid @entity225 and business lobby resistance			1
but the business community may now be coming around to working a bit more closely with the government in the interest of improving security			0
during a @entity36 hearing last week , lawmakers listened to the business community and government officials ' concerns			1
during a similar series of committee hearings this week , lawmakers will examine more ideas on the topic			2

" a cyber attack against a private company dealing with , say a water company is an attack against our nation			2
so is it with an attack on a private company that provides power or clean water to millions of @entity2 , " @entity246 said			2
