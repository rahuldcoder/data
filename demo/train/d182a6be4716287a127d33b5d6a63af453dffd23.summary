trying to stay ahead of the curve of protest : after 10 months of the @entity14 , the region is still in the throes of a heady and unpredictable transformation			0
@entity1 's demise , after the overthrow of @entity2 in @entity18 and @entity19 @entity3 in @entity20 , means that three rulers in power collectively for 95 years are gone			1
scholar and author @entity24 , a senior fellow at the @entity26 , says that 2011 " is to the @entity27 what 1989 was to the communist world			1
the @entity27 are now coming into ownership of their own history and we have to celebrate			1
" protesters in @entity34 and @entity35 may be re-energized by the pictures from @entity37 , @entity38 , showing the almost pathetic end of a ruler whose flowing robes and uniforms had long given him an aura of invincibility			1
demonstrators in @entity35 cities celebrated @entity1 's death and warned president @entity49 that he would be next			0
as one @entity35 activist told @entity0 : " the clear fate of all who kill his people is to end up under the feet of the nation			0
" former @entity57 prime minister @entity56 ( no friend of the @entity35 regime ) said : " any @entity27 citizen , watching the course of events in @entity38 , can not but think of the popular revolutionary movement that is taking place in @entity35			1
" there has been one refrain common across the @entity27 world this year -- from the dusty streets of @entity68 in @entity20 , where it all began , to the barricades that litter @entity71 in @entity35 today : " the fear is gone , the people have put away their fear			1
" those words , spoken by @entity20 activist @entity77 in january , have echoed across the region ever since			0
it was quickly followed by a chant : " the people want the downfall of the regime			0
" even so , it took @entity86 resolutions and thousands of @entity88 sorties to degrade @entity1 's forces			1
and that 's unlikely elsewhere			0
the @entity92 and @entity93 are applying economic sanctions against the @entity35 regime but have persistently discounted military intervention			0
president @entity7 of @entity34 seems impervious to outside pressure and even his own injuries as he maneuvers back into the game			0
and in a majority of @entity27 countries , the power of the state remains formidable if not overwhelming			1
in 1989 , the people of @entity105 shared a continent with developed democracies ; they had a model to copy -- and considerable help in shaking off the legacy of communism			2
the @entity27 states , which did not even draw their own borders , each have different dynamics			1
explosive sectarian and regional divides have enabled authoritarian rule in @entity35 , @entity34 and @entity38			1
like the @entity120 , @entity9 and @entity119 are monarchies and their kings at least have the legitimacy of succession			0
@entity18 and @entity20 have by @entity27 standards a large and capable middle class ; @entity34 does not			1
the @entity120 states are enriched by massive oil and gas reserves ; countries such as @entity9 have little or none			2
the attitude toward women 's rights varies widely ; islamists are stronger in some countries than others			2
perhaps most importantly , security forces are in some places loyal to the flag , in others bound to the regime , or split down the middle			0
the military in @entity20 and @entity18 would not defend leaders who became liabilities ; the military in @entity35 has remained cohesive and loyal to @entity6			2
but one of the few characteristics @entity27 states have long shared is the " freedom deficit , " the product of decades of authoritarian rule			1
a landmark report on @entity27 societies by the @entity156 in 2002 concluded : " this freedom deficit undermines human development and is one of the most painful manifestations of lagging political development			1
" the situation changed little in the following decade , but other forces were at work			0
the @entity165 satellite television networks -- so different from the sclerotic state broadcasters -- gave @entity27 a new window on the world			1
the educated young began to harness the power of the @entity171 , outflanking the ability of bureaucracies to control it			2
they saw their contemporaries in the rest of the world -- @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity105 -- gaining new skills and opportunities , while they remained out of work			2
at the same time , unemployment in the @entity27 world , especially among graduates , remained high ; corruption and nepotism were rampant			1
time and again @entity92 diplomatic cables sent from @entity27 capitals noted a growing tide of popular resentment toward their rulers			1
the 2009 edition of the @entity156 report wrote : " the result is an all - too - common sense of limited opportunities and personal insecurity , witnessed in the world 's highest levels of unemployment , deep and contentious patterns of exclusion , and , ultimately , strong calls from within for reform			2
" ultimately , those calls spilled onto the streets in spontaneous and chaotic fashion			0
now , in three countries that between them occupy 2,000 miles of @entity212 coastline , the hard work has begun of shaping what 's next			2
revolutions are invariably messy affairs whose outcomes are never guaranteed , whatever the ideals of their leaders			2
the @entity221 historian @entity220 wrote : " in a revolution , as in a novel , the most difficult part to invent is the end			0
" @entity226 , director of the @entity227 at the @entity228 , said that in @entity38 's case " the cleavages that we have seen in @entity37 and @entity231 that have resisted the new government are extremely alarming			1
we shall see whether out of this particular turmoil will emerge a unified government with a unified leadership or the political struggle will escalate and intensify			0
" this weekend @entity20 will become the first @entity27 to elect a constituent assembly , which in turn will draw up a new constitution			1
but there is no path to follow			0
what should be the powers of president , prime minister and parliament ? how is power shared between the center and regions ? how are minority rights protected and the independence of the judiciary guaranteed ? what is the role of @entity257 in society ? that last question has already made its way to the top of the agenda in @entity20 , with the @entity264 party leading polls			2
its leader , @entity266 , accuses opponents of scare tactics to frighten businesses and women			0
but the leader of one secular party says the @entity257 pose a threat to the country			0
as @entity27 scour the horizon for templates , some look to @entity279 , where a moderate @entity264 party has been elected three times in a decade and presided over an economic renaissance			1
@entity279 prime minister @entity283 even embarked on a tour of @entity27 states last month ( and in most places was greeted rapturously ) to promote the @entity279 model			2
" a secular state does not mean that the people are atheists , " @entity283 told a television show in @entity289			0
" it means respect for all religions and each individual has the freedom to practice his own religion			0
" but even in @entity299 , tensions persist between the government and a military command that sees itself as the guardian of a secular state , and the government is accused of stifling and harassing its critics			0
the overthrow of three men does not change the basic dilemmas faced by the @entity27 world : illiteracy , unemployment , a youth bulge ( the @entity86 estimates that @entity27 countries will need 50 million new jobs by 2020 ) , chronic water shortages , a lack of women 's rights , the legacy of the " freedom deficit " -- to which perhaps add now a burgeoning crisis of expectations			1
if the @entity14 were on a calendar , we would still be in the first week .			0

scholar says 2011 " is to the @entity27 what 1989 was to the communist world "
@entity86 resolutions , @entity331 sorties helped in @entity38 but are unlikely elsewhere
the power of the state remains formidable in a majority of @entity27 countries
the overthrow of three leaders does *n't* change the dilemmas that @entity27 world faces
