" he 's the subject of an intense manhunt up to 400 law enforcement officers are searching for @entity0 , including members of the @entity53 , the @entity54 and the @entity55			1
they 've zeroed in on the woods not far from @entity0 's family home in @entity58 -- about 20 miles from where @entity21 and @entity28 were shot			1
his evasiveness has led schools to cancel classes and prompted authorities to ask hunters to avoid the woods in the area			0
although @entity0 is on the run and possibly armed , there is no indication that he is a danger to anyone other than law enforcement , @entity32 said			1
" i am convinced that @entity0 has engaged in a personal battle with law enforcement , specifically the @entity6 , and will likely stay focused on that fight , " he said			1

" he was obviously a big critic of the federal government , but he never specifically targeted police when he was talking to me , " @entity111 said			1
" no indications of really any malice towards law enforcement in particular			2
most of his aggression was ( toward ) the federal government			2
