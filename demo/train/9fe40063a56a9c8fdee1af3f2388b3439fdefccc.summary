-- on tuesday afternoon , the @entity2 website experienced wide outage for several hours			1
who has the nerve and ability to take down one of the most iconic newspapers in the world ? the @entity10 , which is loyal to @entity12 president @entity11 , takes responsibility for the hack			1
this is not the first time the @entity10 has attacked news organizations			1
the @entity18 , @entity19 and others have been targeted in recent months as well			0
if the @entity2 saw @entity12 activists spray - painting slogans on its building , it could summon the minions of the law to detain them			1
but if you live far away in a place where @entity30 law does not apply , you are safe			1
it does not take much skill to intrude in cyberspace , and you can find free tools on the internet that will let you stage a protest or an attack			2
when you log on to the @entity35 , you can send packets of digital data around the world in seconds			0
the speed of global connectivity gives the illusion that there are no borders			0
but this is not true			0
there are borders in cyberspace , they are just badly defended			0
the combination of high speeds , global reach and weak defenses means that someone sitting in @entity55 or @entity56 can take action in @entity58 or @entity59 as easily as they could against the building across the street -- perhaps even easier as they wo n't have to leave their chair			0
the @entity10 's attacks are a form of protest against @entity70 media 's portrayal of the @entity11 regime			1
most experts think the @entity10 is not the @entity12 government , but " patriotic hackers " who support it			1
this makes them harder to control and harder to find			0
the @entity10 takes public diplomacy to a new level , letting individuals make their voices known on issues as easily as a government			2
what we have seen from the @entity10 is political action and sometimes political theater			2
hacker groups like @entity89 , @entity90 or the @entity10 have a symbiotic relationship with media that helps turn minor exploits into front - page news			1
the @entity10 likes to go after the media because this is one way to make sure your message is heard			1
the @entity10 's message to the @entity70 media is one of scorn , ridicule and belittlement			1
this week 's attack showed more skill than earlier episodes			0
it resembled a cyber attack made by @entity109 against dissidents in 2011			0
perhaps the @entity109 are helping the @entity10 in cyberspace , but it 's more likely that they provided inspiration			2
the @entity10 broke into the @entity59 company that hosts the @entity2 ' website ( called a registrar ) and changed its internet addresses			1
this redirection was invisible to users who tried to visit @entity119 -- they either could n't connect or were sent to another website controlled by the @entity12			0
the hackers got inside the target network and made some fundamental changes to how it worked			0
some security experts have pointed out that the @entity2 made its own networks vulnerable because of a " misstep " and as a result its website was easier to hack			1
so far , the @entity10 's actions have been embarrassing rather than damaging			2
the attackers probably do n't know how to carry out a more destructive attack			0
but with time they could easily learn			0
the @entity10 's hacking wo n't change the outcome of the conflict in @entity12 ( whatever that will be ) , but we do n't want to discount the political effect of their actions			2
some audiences in the @entity142 likely enjoy seeing @entity70 institutions humbled , and the @entity10 is helping to dispel a sense of powerlessness against the @entity70 behemoth			1
we also do n't want to discount the risks			0
if the @entity10 can slip by feeble defenses to make fun of the media , someone else might be able to get in and cause more serious disruption			1
there are a lot of reasons why the @entity10 might choose not to launch this kind of crippling cyber attack , but the strength of our defense is n't one of them			1
there are things that companies can do to protect themselves			0
@entity59 's @entity166 , the equivalent of @entity168 , has a list of mitigation strategies that would have block most of the @entity10 does , but they are n't well known in the @entity30 the global @entity35 brings tremendous , benefit but the threats are growing faster than our defenses			1
it 's a vulnerable place with few rules			0
until this is changed , hacks on the @entity2 and others will be the norm , not the exception			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			2

on tuesday afternoon , the @entity2 website went down for several hours
@entity183 : @entity10 launched the attack to protest the @entity188
he says the group of " patriotic hackers " *dislike* @entity30 media portrayal of @entity11 regime
@entity183 : some audiences in the @entity142 enjoy seeing @entity70 institutions humbled
