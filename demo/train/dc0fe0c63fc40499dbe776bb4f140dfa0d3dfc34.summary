@entity0 -- some very preliminary talks have been under way " for the past few days " to potentially allow @entity7 bomb suspect @entity5 to resume providing investigators with information about the attacks in exchange for having the death penalty taken off the table , two government sources say			1
the sources said such initial communications between opposing sides on a range of procedural and other issues are standard procedure			2
communications are in the very early stages , and not a sign lawyers for either side are ready to make a deal , said one source , who did not want to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the private discussions			1
the source emphasized these are not formal negotiations , and no deals have been offered			2
the discussions between prosecution and defense attorneys are at a " preliminary , delicate stage " and both refused to offer details of what either side would be willing to leverage , according to the sources			2
a @entity42 official said it is not accurate to suggest there are negotiations			0
" the notion that we are engaging in discussions over a penalty is not accurate , " the official said			0
" as far as i know , there are no negotiations			0
" the government has not said whether it will seek the death penalty in this case			1
@entity42 spokesman @entity55 noted tuesday that " the federal charges against @entity5 authorize a penalty , upon conviction , of death or imprisonment for life , or any term of years			1
" the charges include using a weapon of mass destruction			0
from fear to cheers : the final hours that paralyzed @entity7 " we have no comment at this time on what potential penalty the government might seek if the defendant is convicted , particularly given that the defendant has only just been charged , " @entity55 added			1
this comes after a federal magistrate judge monday approved appointment of a defense attorney who specializes in handling capital cases			2
@entity81 of @entity82 has a reputation of working with high - profile clients to get death - eligible crimes reduced			1
she has represented @entity87 @entity86 , @entity90 @entity89 bomber @entity88 , and most recently @entity93 mass shooter @entity91			0
@entity94 separately cut deals for all three to avoid lethal injection			0
the suspect is hospitalized with gunshot wounds at a federal @entity100 medical center in @entity101 , @entity102			0
he and his brother , @entity103 , are suspected of detonating two explosive devices at the @entity106 race april 15 , leaving three dead and more than 175 people wounded			0
the elder @entity5 was killed three days later in a gun battle with police			2
legal sources say it is not unusual for both sides to reach out and begin these kinds of conversations in high - profile criminal cases			1
those sources say both @entity5 's legal team and top - level @entity42 officials also have been meeting separately to weigh their options			1
two federal public defenders in @entity7 -- @entity121 and @entity122 -- were in the hospital room april 22 when @entity5 had his first court appearance , and had his miranda rights first read to him by federal magistrate @entity126			1
those lawyers had asked for @entity94 to join the legal team , and they must decide whether their client will cooperate with the ongoing investigation			0
@entity5 's lawyers must weigh the initial evidence the government has presented against their client , and the strength of any additional charges that may be added when a formal indictment is presented in coming weeks			1
that evidence and @entity5 's own private statements about his alleged involvement will shape whether plea negotiations develop over time			1
on the other side , government sources say investigators are eager to resume questioning of @entity5 , for any details about other possible suspects and plots			1
what may have motivated the brothers to allegedly commit the terror acts is also of major interest to the @entity153 intelligence community			0
removing execution as a legal option could induce the suspect to talk , but nothing is expected until a grand jury hands down an indictment			0
@entity153 attorney general @entity160 would have the final say on whether prosecutors would pursue the death penalty at trial			1
that decision , too , is some weeks off , said another government source			0
a special team of federal agents were able to speak with the seriously wounded @entity5 for about two days without any @entity170 warnings being given , under a " public safety exception			2
" @entity1 has learned the young man admitted to the acts , and said he and his brother acted alone			0
sources say he has since stopped talking with the government			2
@entity1 's @entity177 and @entity178 contributed to this report .			0

@entity7 bomb suspect @entity5 is no longer talking with investigators
sources : a deal could allow him to avoid the death penalty if he resumes providing information
the talks are not a sign @entity5 's attorneys are ready to make a deal , one source says
