for the second time during his papacy , @entity0 has announced a new group of bishops and archbishops set to become cardinals -- and they come from all over the world			1
pope @entity0 said sunday that he would hold a meeting of cardinals on february 14 " during which i will name 15 new @entity12 who , coming from 13 countries from every continent , manifest the indissoluble links between the @entity17 and the particular @entity18 present in the world , " according to @entity19			1
new cardinals are always important because they set the tone in the church and also elect the next pope , @entity22 @entity21 analyst @entity20 said			0
they are sometimes referred to as the princes of the @entity17			0
the new cardinals come from countries such as @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
" this is a pope who very much wants to reach out to people on the margins , and you clearly see that in this set , " @entity20 said			0
" you 're talking about cardinals from typically overlooked places , like @entity41 , the @entity42 island of @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46			1
" but for the second time since @entity0 ' election , no @entity47 made the list			1
" @entity0 ' pattern is very clear : he wants to go to the geographical peripheries rather than places that are already top - heavy with cardinals , " @entity20 said			2
@entity55 , a professor of church history at @entity57 in @entity58 , noted that @entity0 announced his new slate of cardinals on the @entity61 , which commemorates the visit of the @entity63 to @entity65 ' birthplace in @entity66			2
" on feast of three wise men from far away , the @entity0 's choices for cardinal say that every local church deserves a place at the big table			0
" in other words , @entity0 wants a more decentralized church and wants to hear reform ideas from small communities that sit far from @entity79 's power centers , @entity55 said			0
that does n't mean @entity0 is the first pontiff to appoint cardinals from the developing world , though			2
beginning in the 1920s , an increasing number of @entity85 churchmen were named cardinals , and in the 1960s , @entity88 , whom @entity0 canonized last year , appointed the first cardinals from @entity91 , the @entity92 and @entity93			2
