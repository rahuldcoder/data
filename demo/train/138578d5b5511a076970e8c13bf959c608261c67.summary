-- @entity1 , his face drawn and his eyes exhausted , expressed confusion and dismay about many of the details surrounding his father 's suicide last week			1
but he is sure about one thing			0
" i wish i knew more answers			0
all i can do is trust what he 's told me ... what he asked me to do with his brain , " @entity1 said			1
last week , @entity17 , a 50 - year - old former player for the @entity19 's @entity18 , committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest			1
the details remain hazy , but family members believe that @entity1 avoided injuring his brain so that it could be tested for disease			1
in the coming months , a group of scientists at the @entity27 will scour his brain tissue for evidence of an insidious disease among footballers called chronic traumatic encephalopathy			1
" that has to take a lot of strength and a lot of courage to do that , " said @entity33 , @entity1 's best friend and former @entity18 teammate			2
" to donate your brain and the way that things went down			0
he 's always been a strong person on and off the field , and even at the end , he 's trying to help someone			0
" @entity50 : playing through concussion ' part of the game ' although @entity1 did not say explicitly that he suspected chronic traumatic encephalopathy , his ex-wife said he knew that " something was not right			1
" recently , his vision had been failing him ; so had his ability to form coherent sentences and spell			0
and there was piercing pain on the left side of his brain			0
" he felt the left side of his brain was the cause of many of his problems that he was experiencing , " said @entity1 's ex-wife , @entity65			1
the disease is associated with depression , cognitive problems and suicidal thoughts -- all of which @entity1 seemed to suffer before his death			1
dr. @entity77 , a co-director of the @entity78 for the @entity79 , stressed that as of now , " we have no idea whether he had a disease			0
" it will be months before scientists can confirm whether @entity1 's cognitive and emotional problems were related to chronic traumatic encephalopathy			1
once a brain is donated , @entity77 gets to work , quizzing the donors ' family members to get an accurate picture of the person 's health , behavior changes and the amount of brain trauma he or she suffered			2
at the same time , dr. @entity99 , a neurologist and co-director of the center , examines thin slivers of the donor 's brain and spinal cord tissue under a powerful microscope			2
" ( @entity99 ) does her determination of brain tissue without knowing much about the individual history and symptoms , " @entity77 said			1
" so it does n't bias her interpretation of the brain exam findings			0
" what @entity99 has found in most of the brains she has examined is a central nervous system riddled with brown tangles -- damage characteristic of chronic traumatic encephalopathy -- in athletes with evidence of repeated brain trauma			1
of more than 40 brains studied at @entity27 , more than three - quarters have shown evidence of the disease			1
" it is quite striking to see case after case , especially the ones who took many years of brain trauma , to find this in nearly every one , " said @entity127 , co-director of the @entity27 center			1
@entity65 said her ex-husband suffered countless concussions on the field			0
" sometimes he would come home ( from football games ) with extreme headaches , " she said			0
" we would meet after the game , and he would want me to drive because he felt dizziness or he just did n't feel stable			0
" concussions , and traumatic brain injuries generally , have been implicated as a prime factor in chronic traumatic encephalopathy			1
it is a fact that has dogged the @entity19 , which , for its part , has implemented more rigorous testing of players and rules changes to combat the trend			2
@entity19 head hits may mean sideline exams the @entity19 has also expressed an interest in sharing donated brain tissue , in cases such as @entity1 's , so that it can perform analysis of brain tissue in conjunction with institutions like @entity27			1
the league is seeking collaboration among experts studying the disease and is partnering with the @entity167 and the @entity168 for more eyes , so to speak , on the issue			0
" more people looking at this might give us a better answer , " said dr. @entity171 , co-chairman of the @entity172			0
" we are taking this very seriously , and accelerating research on ( the disease ) will help get us more insight			0
" for @entity1 's family , the first clue that something was wrong came by way of a cryptic text : " a bizarre text message that he sent to my mother saying that he loved her and he loved my family and to please get his brain to the @entity19 brain bank , " @entity1 said			1
if the text at first seemed mysterious , the same wish echoed by @entity1 in a suicide note seemed to cement his resolve			2
it contained a simple , haunting final request : " please , see that my brain is given to the @entity19 's brain bank			2
" despite the chilling details of @entity1 's suicide last week -- and the questions still looming -- his family and friends cling to the hope that something good will come of their pain			2
" it gives us a lot of comfort knowing that something positive and something great is going to come out of this for future players , for little leaguers , for everyone , " @entity65 said of her ex-husband 's suicide			0
" i think that is what we 're holding on to as a family			0
... we 're just so proud of him at this very moment			0
" as difficult as it is to think about his friend 's demise , @entity33 said he hopes that it will all make sense someday and that something substantive will happen as a result of @entity1 's donation			2
" and once they find out what the cause is ... that the @entity19 takes a stand and says , ' ok , we 're going to try to alleviate this problem , because if you do n't , then all this was for nothing , " @entity33 said .			2

@entity17 , former @entity19 player , shot himself in the chest last week
@entity1 requested that his brain be donated to test for disease
@entity19 has *joined* fight against chronic traumatic encephalopathy
scientists at @entity27 will study his brain tissue
