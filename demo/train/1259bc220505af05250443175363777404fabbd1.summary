both @entity8 's goals came from the penalty spot , with midfielder @entity14 scoring after @entity15 handled @entity17 's flick and then @entity18 fouled the striker on the edge of the area			2
the home fans were furious when the @entity24 defender remained on the pitch despite illegally denying striker @entity26 what appeared to be a goalscoring opportunity , and @entity3 hit back in the second half after bringing on strikers @entity10 and @entity31 to replace @entity15 and midfielder @entity32			0
@entity2 curled in a superb free - kick in the 65th minute , then leveled eight minutes later with the 100th @entity5 goal of his career			1

@entity60 's team are now 11 points off the pace , but @entity3 have played one more game than the rest of the top five			0
striker @entity66 gave 10th - placed @entity58 the lead in the eighth minute after surging forward from the halfway line , but @entity70 star @entity69 leveled with his first goal since january 24 with a header from @entity74 's cross in the 33rd minute			1
@entity69 twice hit the woodwork , while @entity58 's @entity76 and @entity77 were both denied by the crossbar			0
@entity60 brought on @entity79 for @entity74 after an hour , but the @entity81 striker is still yet to score following his $ 80 million move from @entity83 in january			0
second - placed @entity6 no longer have the distraction of playing in @entity85 , but @entity88 's team 's poor run continued with a 0 - 0 draw at home to 10 - man @entity91			1
the visitors had @entity94 sent off with 14 minutes to play after a two - footed challenge on defender @entity96 , but @entity6 could not force a winning goal and have now triumphed in just one game in seven in all competitions			2
fifth - placed @entity99 also suffered frustration ahead of tuesday 's @entity52 quarterfinal first leg away to @entity102 , being held goalless by bottom team @entity103			0
the result was a big blow in the @entity54 team 's hopes of qualifying for next season 's premier @entity109 competition , with fourth - placed @entity112 three points ahead of @entity114 's side ahead of sunday 's home match against @entity116			1
@entity83 's bid to catch @entity99 and secure a @entity119 place faltered after a 2 - 1 defeat at former manager @entity122 's new team @entity121			2
@entity124 defender @entity123 headed @entity83 into the lead five minutes after halftime , but @entity127 leveled with a penalty just after the hour and then netted the winner from the spot with a minute to go as @entity132 striker striker @entity131 was fouled both times			0
the result lifted @entity121 into 12th place , four points above the relegation zone			0
seventh - placed @entity138 moved to within four points of local rivals @entity83 after snatching a 2 - 2 draw at home to @entity143 , who came from behind to lead with a double from @entity38 striker @entity146			0
@entity147 leveled with a penalty seven minutes from fulltime after @entity151 midfielder @entity150 fouled @entity152			0
eighth - placed @entity153 lost 2 - 1 at @entity154 , a victory which lifted the @entity157 winners out of the bottom three as veteran striker @entity158 and midfielder @entity159 scored before @entity161 's consolation			2
