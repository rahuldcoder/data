@entity0 left @entity1 for the @entity2 , by official accounts , a healthy man			1
just over two weeks later , he passed away at a @entity7 , @entity6 , hospital with @entity8			1
@entity0 was admitted into isolation at @entity10 on september 28 with common symptoms of @entity8 : fever , vomiting and diarrhea			1
he later tested positive for the virus that has killed more than 3,400 people in @entity17			0
he was started on the experimental drug brincidofovir on october 4 -- far too long after he arrived at the hospital , his family has said			2
on tuesday , the hospital reported that @entity0 was on a ventilator and his kidneys were failing			1
@entity0 died on wednesday at 7:51 a.m. " his suffering is over , " his partner @entity24 said in a statement			1
" my family is in deep sadness and grief , but we leave him in the hands of @entity33			0
our deepest sympathies go out to his father and family in @entity1 and here in @entity2			1
@entity38 was a wonderful man who showed compassion toward all			0
" who was @entity0 , besides the first person to be diagnosed with @entity8 in the @entity2 ? when did he start to feel sick , and why could n't the @entity2 health care system save him ? " the past week has been an enormous test of our health system , but for one family it has been far more personal , " dr. @entity44 , commissioner of the @entity45 , said in a statement			1
" the doctors , nurses and staff at @entity55 provided excellent and compassionate care , but @entity8 is a disease that attacks the body in many ways			2
we 'll continue every effort to contain the spread of the virus and protect people from this threat			0
" who was @entity0 ? he was a 42 - year - old @entity1 citizen			1
@entity0 's @entity66 page indicates that he 's from the @entity1 capital of @entity68 , where he attended @entity70 @entity69			1
why did he come to the @entity2 ? to visit family and friends			2
@entity0 was visiting his son and his son 's mother in @entity7 , according to @entity76 , @entity0 's half - brother , who noted this was @entity0 's first trip to @entity2			1
when did @entity0 leave @entity1 ? he departed the @entity17 nation on september 19 , @entity79 director dr. @entity78 says			1
how did he get @entity8 ? health authorities have n't said			2
witnesses say @entity0 had been helping @entity8 patients in @entity1			1
@entity1 community leader @entity84 said @entity0 was caring for an ebola - infected patient at a residence in @entity87 , just outside @entity68			1
the @entity88 reported that @entity0 had direct contact with a pregnant woman stricken with @entity8 on september 15 , days before he left for the @entity2			1
citing the woman 's parents and @entity0 's neighbors in @entity68 , @entity1 , the newspaper said @entity0 had helped carry the ailing woman home after a hospital turned her away because there was n't enough space in its @entity8 treatment ward			1
was he screened for @entity8 before getting on the plane ? yes , according to @entity102 , board chairman of the @entity103			2
" the first screening was at the gate , before you get to the parking lot			0
the second time is before you enter the terminal building and the third is before you board the flight			0
at every point your temperature is scanned			0
" his temperature at those checkpoints was a consistent 97.3 degrees @entity115 , @entity79 chief @entity78 told reporters thursday			0
yet on a health screening questionnaire , @entity0 answered " no " to questions about whether he had cared for a patient with the deadly virus and whether he had touched the body of someone who died in an area affected by the disease , @entity102 said			2
complete coverage on @entity8 when did his @entity8 symptoms appear ? " four or five days " after his trip , according to the @entity79 's @entity78			2
this does n't mean that @entity0 actually got infected with @entity8 in the @entity2			1
the incubation period for the virus is 2 to 21 days , meaning that a person could be infected with the disease for up to three weeks before showing any signs of it			2
when he did seek medical help ? @entity0 first walked into @entity136 after 10 p.m. on september 25			2
@entity76 reports @entity0 had a fever and was vomiting during this first visit to the @entity7 hospital			1
the hospital , in a statement , said he had a " low grade fever and abdominal pain			0
" he underwent basic blood tests but was n't screened for @entity8 , said dr. @entity145 from the @entity7 hospital			1
@entity0 left the medical facility after being given antibiotics and a pain reliever , his friend said			0
" his condition did not warrant admission , " the hospital said			0
" he also was not exhibiting symptoms specific to @entity8			0
" were flags raised that @entity0 might have @entity8 ? after being asked by a nurse , @entity0 did say that he 'd traveled from @entity17 , said dr. @entity156 , executive vice president of @entity55 's parent company			1
but that detail -- which might have raised an alarm that @entity0 might have @entity8 , since @entity1 is one of the countries hardest hit by the virus -- was not " fully communicated " to the medical team , according to @entity156			1
when was he admitted to @entity10 ? on september 28			0
by the time @entity0 arrived via ambulance , " @entity165 had already identified potential need for isolation , " the hospital said			2
what treatment did he receive ? @entity0 was given supportive therapy -- meaning fluids and other therapies that would help support his immune system while it was trying to fight off the virus			0
he was also started on the experimental anti-viral drug brincidofovir on october 4			0
since the drugs being used to treat @entity8 are still experimental , it is up to each individual hospital to file the paperwork with the @entity182 for permission to get the drug from the manufacturer and use it			2
the hospital has declined to tell @entity187 when they filed for permission to the @entity182 to use brincidofovir			0
" the care team has been consulting with the @entity79 and @entity193 , on a daily basis since mr. @entity0 was admitted to the hospital , discussing the possible course of treatment , including the use of investigational drugs , " hospital spokesman @entity190 said in a statement			1
family questions wait on experimental drug @entity0 was not given a blood transfusion with blood donated by an @entity8 survivor , as @entity8 patients dr. @entity206 and @entity207 were given in @entity208			1
why did he die ? the other @entity8 patients brought to the @entity2 for treatment are still alive			1
three have been released from the hospital and one is reportedly in stable condition at @entity214			0
so what 's different about @entity0 ? as @entity44 said , @entity8 attacks the body in many ways			1
experts estimate the current outbreak in @entity17 has around a 71 % fatality rate			0
supportive therapy can help , but there are no proven cures for the disease			0
@entity0 did not start receiving treatment until several days after he started experiencing symptoms , which may have contributed to his rapid decline			2
what will happen to his body ? an ebola patient 's body is still highly infectious			0
any contact with the bodily fluids could result in transmission of the virus			0
" only personnel trained in handling infected human remains , and wearing @entity239 ( personal protective equipment ) , should touch , or move , any ebola - infected remains , " @entity79 guidelines state			0
" autopsies on patients who die of @entity8 should be avoided			0
" @entity0 's body will be enclosed in two bags and the bags will be disinfected for transportation , @entity6 health officials say			0
then the body will be cremated .			0
