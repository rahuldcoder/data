it 's 7.30 on a foggy wednesday morning and heavy bass is thick in the air outside an industrial - looking venue in @entity13			1
there 's excited chatter in the queue , with clubbers dressed in everything from lycra bodysuits to cow costumes			2
inside , a crowd of thousand are getting whipped up by the dj as they bounce around on the dance floor			2
the tunes date back to the 1990s and plenty of people here remember the rave generation or were part of it			2
there are nurses , lawyers , parents with kids , a smattering of seniors and some teenyboppers too			1
this monthly event , called @entity41 , is billed as drug - free			1
the only dealing is going on at the smoothie bar			2
on paper , it 's hard to see how it works , but the vibe is full of energy			0
as for the dress code , you wear what you fancy and you dance how you want			0
" i just feel very wired and on it , and ready to take on the day			0
