-- with a breezy sweep of his pen president @entity1 wrote a new chapter into @entity6 's turbulent history , committing the region to a future returned to @entity10 domain			1
sixty years prior , @entity12 's breakaway peninsula was signed away just as swiftly by @entity14 leader @entity13			0
but dealing with such a blatant land grab on its eastern flank wo n't be anywhere near as quick and easy for @entity20 's 28 - member union			2
because , unlike @entity6 's rushed referendum , everyone has a say			0
after initially slapping visa restrictions and asset freezes on a limited number of little known politicians and military men , @entity20 is facing urgent calls to widen the scope of its measures to target the @entity10 business community in particular			1
the logic of this is that those who run @entity10 and own it are essentially two sides of the coin			2
@entity38 , one - time @entity39 mayoral contender now under house arrest for opposing the current regime , called for @entity20 's leaders to ban everyone -- from @entity1 's personal banker to @entity46 owner @entity45 from keeping their money and loved ones abroad			1
asset freezes and visa restrictions are especially palatable options for the @entity52 because they can be rolled out on a discretionary basis , without requiring cumbersome legal procedures and recourse			0
in fact @entity10 cancels visas for people it does n't like all the time			2
just look at @entity62 founder @entity61 who lost both his right of entry and @entity39 - based money in 2005 and dare not go back			0
@entity10 also banned the adoption of its orphans by @entity68 in retaliation for the @entity68 's implementation of an anti-corruption law named after @entity72 , @entity61 's lawyer who died after a year in a @entity39 detention center , apparently beaten to death			2
yet in playing the ' money talks ' card , @entity20 must be ready for the consequences of such action			0
as such @entity52 leaders must be ready to accept sanctions are a two - way street and will hurt both sides			1
targeting @entity10 's peripatetic business community would be one way of sapping their tenuous support for president @entity1			1
and such a strategy might also turn out to have a silver lining : awarding @entity52 countries a chance to finally deal with some of the more unpleasant sides of their patronage , including money laundering and corruption , which have inflated prize assets like @entity100 property and @entity102 paintings for years			0
where @entity20 should hold fire though is trade			0
two decades of @entity107 rapprochement and almost $ 500 billion worth of commerce is a lot to put at stake			0
it 's true that any trade war would hurt @entity10 far harder than it would the @entity52 - not least because 15 % of the former 's gdp comes from exports to the bloc			1
but @entity20 - with its hefty reliance on @entity10 gas - would have a hard time keeping its factories going and citizens warm without power from the east			1
and while @entity1 flexes his political muscle , open trade channels keep the dialogue going giving all sides a chance to change the subject and talk less tensely			0
no one can afford to cut off that lifeline , especially now with @entity20 's economy on the rebound and @entity10 's one on the wane .			1

@entity137 says @entity20 must be ready to accept sanctions will hurt both sides
targeting @entity10 's business community would be one way of sapping their support for president @entity1 , she says
but she says @entity20 would have a hard time keeping its factories going without power from the east
