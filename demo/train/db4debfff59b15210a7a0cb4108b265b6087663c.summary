-- great evil often brings out the best in good men , men like @entity5 on flight 93 , @entity8 recipient @entity7 in @entity9 and now the @entity10 three -- the three young men , each in different parts of theater nine , who gave their lives to protect their girlfriends			1
twenty - five - year - old @entity17 was sitting next to his girlfriend , @entity18 , at the midnight premiere of " @entity20 " when the gunman ( who shall remain nameless ) opened fire in the dark theater			1
@entity17 instinctively pushed his girlfriend to the ground and threw his body on top of hers			1
@entity17 , a security guard , served five years in the @entity29 and was in the process of re-enlisting in hopes of becoming a @entity33 , family and friends said			1
he was killed in the gunfire ; his girlfriend survived			0
twenty - four - year - old @entity36 dived on top of his girlfriend , @entity38 , when the gunfire erupted			1
covering her body , he took the bullets so they did not harm her			0
she survived the massacre ; he did not			0
@entity45 , 27 years old , threw his body in front of his girlfriend , @entity47 , as the shooting continued			1
@entity47 survived with a gunshot wound to the knee ; @entity45 's body absorbed the fatal shots			1
these men were three of the 12 innocent people killed early that morning			0
their incredible sacrifice leaves us asking : why ? why would a young man with his entire life ahead of him risk everything for a woman he has no legal , financial or marital obligations to ? opinion : looking into the minds of killers as @entity66 so eloquently pointed out in a recent article , calling it chivalry would be a tremendous understatement			1
by all appearances , these men believed that a man has a responsibility to protect a woman , even to the point of death			1
they believed that there are things in life worth dying for and the innocent woman sitting next to them was one			0
they believed , to put it simply , in a code of honor			2
they put the lives of the women before their own , an old fashioned notion to be sure , but certainly an honorable one ( if you have any doubt , ask the survivors )			0
their instincts were to protect , not run away			2
remembering the @entity95 shooting victims from all accounts , these young men were average , working men in their 20s			1
( we know a little about @entity17 , but not much , and we know even less about the others			2
) like all men , they had their own struggles			2
after his death we learned that @entity17 had an ex-wife and two children living in @entity110			2
he was scheduled to visit them to resolve marital issues			0
this is n't to take anything away from @entity17 or the other two heroes , but to illustrate that , in spite of shortcomings , men can still recognize what it means to be a good man and act like one			1
@entity123 : @entity124 drives gun debate this is especially important given the state of many men today			0
record numbers of men are n't working or even looking for work			0
record numbers are n't marrying or even acting as fathers to their children			0
these men need heroes to imitate whom they can relate to in everyday life , not just make - believe superheroes who catch their imagination for an hour or two			1
they need heroes like the @entity10 three			0
while much of the media obsesses over the psychology and motivations of this deranged killer , we should hold the @entity10 three high			0
it is only by telling their story that this code of honor will survive for future generations of men			1
" the world is forwarded by having its attention fixed on the best things , " @entity153 wrote			0
in an age when traditional manhood has been increasingly relegated to fiction -- capes , masks and green screens -- these three men stand as real - life heroes			1
their actions remind us that good triumphs over evil , not just in movies , but also in reality			2
how to help the victims are you a friend or family member of one of the victims ? share your tributes here			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			2

@entity181 says three men in @entity95 shooting died while shielding girlfriends
he says actions of @entity17 , @entity36 , @entity45 leave us *wondering* at their sacrifice
@entity181 : it was more than chivalry ; it was a code of honor , an instinct to protect , not run
@entity181 : the three had their struggles , showed themselves as good men , real - life heroes
