-- a heavily glaciated region of the @entity2 is bucking the trend of global ice loss and showing small signs of increasing in mass , according to a new study			1
data examining six regions in the @entity11 mountains in the western @entity2 , which contains 7,700 square miles ( nearly 20,000 square kilometers ) of glaciers , revealed more than half of them are either stable or have been advancing in recent years			1
@entity16 scientists observed the size and shape of ice covering 2,168 square miles ( 5,615 square kilometers ) in central @entity11 using satellite data from the @entity21 ( @entity22 ) and the @entity23 ( @entity24 )			1
between 1999 and 2008 the glaciers gained , on average , the water equivalent of around 11 centimeters a year , according to the study published in the journal @entity29			1
lead author , @entity30 from @entity31 in @entity16 says explanations for this increase are still not clear , but might lie in the localized climate			0
" studies have already reported an increase in winter precipitation and a lowering of summer temperatures since the 1960s in low - altitude valleys of @entity11 , " @entity30 said			2
" given the wide extent of high mountain @entity44 , we can not expect the climate to be uniform over the whole range , so a peculiar atmospheric behavior over @entity11 may not be surprising , " she added			2
the study confirms an anomaly in the region which was put forward in 2005 and contrasts with the experience of the central and eastern @entity2 where most glaciers are shrinking , say researchers			1
that story is one which is being repeated globally , say the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) and has been since the end of the @entity59 around 150 years ago			0
wgms estimate that since 1980 the cumulative average thickness loss of monitored glaciers across the world has been 11.3 meters			0
despite the overall picture of retreat , there are instances where glaciers are able to re-advance and @entity11 is an example , says @entity57 director @entity69			1
" the @entity2 is the highest mountain range on @entity71 with the highest elevation difference			2
it 's a huge area			0
so we expect regions ( of it ) to act a bit different , " @entity69 said			0
glacier data in the wider @entity2 region hit the headlines in 2010 when the @entity81 had to apologize for a " poorly substantiated " study they cited which claimed all @entity2 glaciers could melt by 2035			1
@entity69 told @entity0 at the time that the data , which found its way into their @entity88 ( @entity88 ) , was flawed , saying there were " simply no observations available to make these sorts of statements			0
" but this most recent work using satellites is of great value , he says , giving a picture of what is happening in a region where data has traditionally been scarce due to its remoteness and political issues -- the @entity11 range borders @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			1
despite the slight gains , @entity30 says , the message on climate change remains the same			0
" global warming is far from spatially homogeneous and continuous with time			0
in our warming world , there are regions of the @entity71 where , during a few years or decades , the atmosphere is not warming or even cooling , " @entity30 said			0
" @entity11 may be one of those , but we lack consistent high elevation weather station to conclude firmly on this			2

glaciers in the @entity11 mountains in western @entity2 are stable or gaining mass , new study says
data from two satellites reveals small increases since *beginning* of 21st century
small gains are in contrast to the picture of melting in rest of @entity2 and in other regions
