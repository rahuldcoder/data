@entity0 -- @entity2 threw her arms around @entity4			1
" we did it , " she said , before pulling back to look at @entity4 , a @entity7 immigrant and senior at the @entity9 named in the complaint			1
" the @entity12 on wednesday signed a 2Â½ - year civil rights agreement with the @entity14 to address @entity16 immigrant violence at @entity0			1
the agreement requires the school to submit an anti-harassment action plan and continue implementing policies and procedures to prevent harassment based on race , color and / or national origin			2
the action serves as a nationwide standard for bullying prevention at schools , said @entity30 , director for @entity31 at the @entity32			1
" every school needs a policy , but a policy is n't always enough , " @entity30 said			2
" everyone needs to know what to look for and how to respond			2
" looking at the school system as a whole , versus creating policies that focus solely on perpetrators , is a more beneficial way to combat the issue of bullying , @entity30 said			1
" @entity46 does n't occur in a vacuum , it occurs where it 's allowed , " @entity30 said			2
" what this ( agreement ) says to schools is do n't wait until there 's a problem , every school should be self - auditing			1
" complaints were triggered by events on december 3 , 2009 , during which large numbers of @entity60 immigrant students from @entity9 were assaulted in and around the school throughout the day			2
several students were sent to the hospital			2
the attacks followed years of harassment against @entity60 students at @entity9 , according to the complaints filed with the state and federal government			2
in the days after the incident , more than 50 @entity60 students organized an eight - day boycott of the school in efforts to draw attention to what they felt was an inadequate response by the school staff to the ongoing harassment and violence			0
the december 2009 boycott brought nationwide attention to the violence against @entity60 students at @entity0			1
months later , a federal investigation was launched after a formal civil rights complaint was filed by the @entity88			0
the @entity14 , which announced its investigation in august , instructed the school system to improve the treatment of @entity60 students			0
" we will always remember december 3 , but we will refuse to be defined by that day , " @entity93 , who was a senior at the time of the melee , told the members of the @entity97 when the settlement was announced			0
" a year ago we came to you as victims			0
today we come to you as youth activists , as organizers and leaders who have shown the power to make change			0
" according to the complaint , " the district and the school acted with ' deliberate indifference ' to the harassment against @entity60 students and ' intentional disregard for the welfare of @entity60 students ' " at the school			0
the settlement proves the violence at @entity9 was racial , not gang related as once rumored , making it a bittersweet accomplishment , because the school district failed the students , said @entity2 , a board member for @entity123 , a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering the @entity60 community			0
" we celebrate the lasting gains of these agreements , " said @entity2 , who helped many @entity60 students document their experiences			0
" we hope that they are also welcomed with a measure of abiding humility and deep sorrow for the lack of action that required it			0
" the settlement agreement , which holds the district responsible for implementation and oversight , resolves eight discrimination complaints alleging widespread harassment of @entity60 students at @entity9 , and will remain in effect until june 2013			0
the settlement terms " will in no way impact what is happening " unless the individuals who have been doing the bullying are brought to justice , said @entity144 , @entity145 and principal at @entity147 in @entity148 , @entity149			1
" it 's not going to change anything , " @entity144 said , adding that a coordinated , united front must be in place between school and home			1
" parents need to monitor what happens at home , and schools need to monitor what happens at school			1
" it is important to understand what bullying is , @entity144 said , adding that school administrators are responsible for knowing how to detect it			1
" to be bullied is to have an individual or group experience systematic or focused actions , " he said			0
" @entity46 is that behavior that makes you not want to go to school , or not want to live anymore			0
" additional settlement terms require the school and / or district to retain an expert consultant in the area of harassment and discrimination based on race , conduct training of faculty , staff and students on discrimination and harassment based on race ; to maintain records of investigations and responses to allegations of harassment ; and to provide annual compliance reports to the department and @entity200 , as well as makes harassment data publicly available			1
litigation is not the solution to prevent bullying , said @entity205 , founder of the @entity206			1
" you can make the district police it , but as soon as they go off campus it 's not dealt with , " he said			0
in order to combat bullying , students and schools need to do more than translating correspondence into designated languages or submitting annual compliance reports to officials , @entity205 said			1
" the reality is we have to create a sense of solidarity			0
we need a kinder , gentler society where respect is the norm , " he said			0
" yes , we have to pay attention to this , but we ca n't litigate our way out of this problem			1

@entity1 education *contributor* @entity144 says bullies must be brought to justice
