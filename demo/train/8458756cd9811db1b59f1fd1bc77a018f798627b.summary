-- @entity1 has backed @entity2 to deliver a " fantastic " @entity3 amid growing fears the country will not be ready in time to host football 's showpiece event			1
the legendary former striker , who won three @entity9 with @entity2 between 1958 and 1970 , has rejected accusations that delays to a number of the 12 venues hamper his country 's ability to put on a spectacle			1
@entity17 , the game 's world governing body , has confirmed it expects all six stadiums still under construction to miss the deadline of december 31			1
" i 've no doubt , " @entity1 told @entity0 when asked if he thought the @entity3 would be a success			1
" we had a little problem with the @entity26 ( in june ) but i 've no doubt the @entity3 will be a fantastic show			1
" two people were killed last month at @entity30 when a crane hoisting a part of the metal roof collapsed , causing the piece to fall , partially damaging the building , according to a statement released by the construction company , @entity37			0
after meetings ahead of friday 's @entity3 draw , @entity17 president @entity38 said it had received confirmation that @entity30 would not be completed until the middle of april			1
" it is a question of trust , " he said at a press conference at the @entity45 where the draw will be held			0
" for the time being there is no @entity50 " despite the setback , @entity1 is adamant that @entity2 will be ready for the tournament , which is scheduled to start in @entity53 on june 12			1
" i think @entity2 has the stadiums , " he said			2
" we have eight months to go before the @entity3			1
we have to forget about the stadiums and pay attention to the game			2
" @entity17 also confirmed that stadiums in @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 have yet to confirm their schedules , but are expected to host their first events in january 2014			1
@entity66 , meanwhile , is scheduled to host its first match in late february or early march			0
@entity2 has not hosted the @entity3 since 1950 -- when it lost 2 - 1 in the deciding match to @entity69			1
it is a result which still rankles with @entity1			1
" listen , if i was @entity71 , i would like to see @entity2 play against @entity69 , " he added			0
" it 's a good opportunity to get revenge			0
" to talk about the possibility today ... of course we have two national teams that play very good			0
" i think @entity78 is at a very good level			0
@entity80 has a chance to get to the final and @entity2			0
" at the moment those are the three national teams , but you can not forget @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 -- all the teams that have tradition to be in the final			0
" but i hope @entity2 get to the final			0
" @entity1 sat down with @entity0 in @entity53 where he was shooting a @entity92 commercial with swimming champion @entity93			2
he is set to take part in friday 's @entity3 draw where all 32 teams will discover their fate			2
but the 73 - year - old says he is desperate to avoid pulling balls out of the pots in case he hands @entity2 an impossible task to get through the group stage			2
" i do n't know exactly what my role will be but normally when i 've been at other @entity3 draws in other countries			2
my role was to take the ball , do interviews and talk with people			0
" but here in @entity2 , i will not try to take the ball because i 'm afraid i wo n't put @entity2 in a good group			0
