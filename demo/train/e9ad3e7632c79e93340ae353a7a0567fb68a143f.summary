-- hip - hop artist @entity1 wants to create a supportive community for youths on @entity5 's @entity4			1
the @entity7 winner started the @entity8 to help underserved youth develop leadership and life skills			1
@entity1 also performed at " @entity12 : an all - star tribute " last year			1
@entity0 's @entity15 recently spoke with him about @entity12 and his philanthropy			1
below are excerpts : @entity15 : what inspired you to start the @entity8 ? common : i started ( the foundation ) with some of my team members because we wanted to give back to the youth who did n't have some of the opportunities we had			1
the programs are really about building holistic people , children			2
we want them to be together and get educated on everything from health issues to just being allowed to be creative			2
everything that 's necessary to build a complete human being , we try to issue in with the @entity8			1
the kids get to do creative cooking , creative writing and then also get assisted in some of their academic work in school			1
@entity39 : why is this cause important to you ? common : i grew up on the @entity4 of @entity5 with my mother and my stepfather , and i was provided a nice home , a home with love in it			1
and i felt a lot of my friends did n't have some of the opportunities i had			1
also , they had loved ones who they had lost			2
my whole life growing up , i was doing the little things that i could do ( to help people )			2
i would watch my mother do the things that she does			2
as a teacher , she 's an educator and also would just go the extra mile to help people			1
those are the traits that i picked up that made me say , " hey , i want to do this because i have seen , throughout my life , people i love that did n't have the chance , that did n't have the opportunities i had			1
" @entity39 : what 's your goal for the kids ? common : i want to empower the kids because there is a lot of gang violence and there is a lot of lack of love in the neighborhoods , and that starts in the home			1
i want to empower them first by letting them know that they are loved and people do care			2
they might not have the parent , or one parent might be missing , or one parent might not be sufficient in raising them			0
but they have other people that do care			0
and somewhere within this village is somebody that 's going to reach out and help give them a chance to pursue their dream			1
so we empower them first by instilling some love in them and being their support system			0
and then we help to develop whatever their skills are			0
we want to prepare them to be able to go out into the world and do things for themselves so they can be leaders			0
it 's about being their leader			1
you got to lead yourself first			0
@entity39 : what was it like performing at " @entity12 : an all - star tribute " last year ? common : ( it ) was an incredible experience			1
i felt distinguished being there , because there were so many people who really cared about things			0
my mother told me before going there : getting invited there , that is an important place to be because that is where a lot of people that do the real work are			2
these are people who do work for real in the world helping people			0
and it was super-inspiring to me			0
i have to step up more , because you see people who dedicate their lives to helping others			0
being able to perform with @entity146 and @entity147 was a great experience			0
i was like , " i want to go back , i need to get invited back			0
" but more than anything , i was grateful to be there and observe people and honor the people that were selected to be @entity12 , because it was well deserved and they inspired us all			0
@entity39 : what is a hero to you ? common : a hero to me is someone who is able to take whatever talent , gift , personality , quality and utilize it to help build others			2
and obviously a hero has done it to build themselves to a certain level			0
but you use the plateau you reached and you say , " hey , i can do something for other people to help them to get to the same place i got to			0
" so i look at a hero as somebody who is willing to sacrifice that and go back and reach out for others .			0
