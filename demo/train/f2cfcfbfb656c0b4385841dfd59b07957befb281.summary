-- there 's an old saying that a lie can go halfway around the world while the truth is putting its boots on -- and in politics , a steady drumbeat of misinformation and mischaracterization can too often shape the national debate			1
so we wanted to set up a regular online column to confront fear - mongering with the facts , whether it comes from the right or the left during the 2012 campaign			0
working with the @entity0 research team , we 'll investigate candidate claims and call bull when necessary			1
at a time when partisan spin can disproportionately dominate our democracy , this is an attempt to be an independent voice and an honest broker			0
tuesday night 's @entity0 national security debate offered plenty of red meat along with principled policy disagreement			1
but one candidate in particular kept playing fast and loose with the facts : @entity34			2
it 's part of her usual schtick : playing politics by talk radio rules , where impact is far more important than accuracy			1
here 's one of my favorite @entity34 howlers from last night : " this is one thing we know about @entity46			1
he has essentially handed over our interrogation of terrorists to the @entity50			2
he 's outsourced it to them			2
our @entity53 has no ability to have any form of interrogation for terrorists			2
" sounds scary -- and what i love about this particular riff is that it hits so many paranoid - style themes all in one place			0
there is the image of president @entity46 as the @entity66 ve professor , an out - of - touch egghead compromising national security by bringing in card - carrying members of the @entity50 to interrogate terrorists			1
not only that , he 's " outsourced " the effort , taking jobs away from our fighting men and women			2
finally , there 's the bedrock proof point that makes the rhetoric sound real : our @entity53 now has no ability to interrogate terrorists			1
somewhere , @entity81 must be weeping			0
but what are the facts ? the @entity0 research team has fact - checked such claims from @entity34 before and found that " the controversial @entity53 ' black site ' prison program , where the suspect of the @entity89 and others were interrogated immediately after arrest , has been dismantled			1
... however , the @entity53 is still interrogating terror suspects in the field in certain cases			2
for example , @entity0 reported in july that @entity53 operatives have secretly traveled to @entity97 , @entity98 , to help interrogate terrorism suspects about terror operations in @entity101 and @entity102			1
... in a separate incident earlier this year , @entity0 reported that @entity104 , a @entity98 whom the @entity105 indicted for providing material support to @entity108 linked groups , was interrogated for weeks by @entity105 authorities on a @entity112 amphibious assault ship before he was transferred to @entity114 custody and brought to the @entity105 to make an appearance in federal court this past july			0
" in other words , @entity34 's claims are n't true			1
they have more to do with fear - mongering than facts			0
and of course , her characterization of the @entity46 administration as pursuing a " doctrine of appeasement " flies in the face of @entity129 's corpse and a massive escalation of drone strikes that have killed numerous high - level @entity108 operatives based on actionable intelligence			1
this riff is echoed by repeated accusations from presumptive front - runner @entity137 that @entity46 " apologizes for @entity105			0
" again , it 's a popular narrative that plays off liberal stereotypes from the late 1960s , but it 's not rooted in the reality of this administration			0
the subject of energy independence also inspired @entity34 to reach for a bridge too far			1
here 's what she said last night : " energy independence is something that president @entity46 certainly has avoided			1
... almost every decision that the president has made since he came in has been one to put the @entity105 in a position of unilateral disarmament , including the most recent decision he made to cancel the @entity153			0
" here , @entity34 reflexively reaches for the rhetoric of cold war weakness -- " unilateral disarmament " -- saying that he has " certainly avoided " any effort at " energy independence			1
" but as the failed half - billion - dollar @entity160 investment shows , the administration , for better or worse , has put a lot of capital into creating " green jobs " as a way of decreasing our dependence on foreign oil while building a 21st - century energy industry			0
beneath all the play - to - the - base rhetoric is this core claim : that @entity46 made a decision to cancel the @entity153			0
instead , the administration made a play to its own base by delaying any decision on the @entity153 pipeline until after the election 2013 , pending further review			0
this made environmental protesters happy , giving them at least a short - term win			0
but both the pro and con claims over the pipeline in terms of job creation and environmental impact have probably been overstated			2
and the @entity0 truth squad had no problem calling @entity34 's @entity153 claims " misleading			1
" i could n't help but notice a @entity193 report that @entity34 received an overheated nod of support ( but not an endorsement ) from @entity197 on his radio show this week			2
the @entity199 of the paranoid style said that of all the candidates in the 2012 @entity206 field , @entity34 " truly comes the closest to embodying the spirit of @entity202 or @entity203			0
" i ca n't think of any qualities that those two @entity105 icons share with the congresswoman from @entity210 , but i know there 's at least one clear contrast : @entity213 never told a lie			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			0

@entity217 : @entity34 *distorted* the truth at @entity0 debate
he says she **wrong*ly* said the @entity53 's interrogations had been outsourced to @entity50
her claims that @entity46 avoid energy independence and killed pipeline are *wrong* , he says
@entity217 : @entity34 plays politics by " talk show rules , " aiming for impact , not accuracy
