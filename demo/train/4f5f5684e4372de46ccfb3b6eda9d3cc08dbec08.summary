-- it was 1993 when @entity2 got his first look at the @entity4			1
working as a consultant for the city of @entity8 , @entity9 , in the epicenter of the dotcom universe , some researchers pulled up a web page created by the @entity13 , showcasing some of its artwork			1
" the web pages back then had that gray and black text and embedded images			1
there was no fancy layout ; it was very simplistic , " he said			2
" but it was powerful			2
i said , ' my @entity25 , this is it			2
this is what 's going to define the next phase of my life			1
' it was a quite powerful , transformative concept			2
" it 's hard for some of us to imagine now			2
but before broadband and @entity38 , before instant streaming and overnight deliveries from @entity36 , the early @entity4 was a slow , simple and sparsely populated place			1
as the @entity4 turns 25 this week , folks who remember those early days have been reminiscing about life online in the early to mid- 1990s			1
one word that comes up over and over again ? " slow			1
" a 1995 survey by the @entity43 found that just 14 % of @entity45 adults had internet access , and among them , only 2 % had access via a top - of - the - line 28.8k modem			1
" that was screaming ( fast ) , " said @entity50 , the director of @entity43 's @entity51			2
" now , that would make people riot in the streets , it 's so slow			1
" @entity2 , now chief technology officer with linked - data company 3 @entity57 , would go on to a career on the @entity4 and to author several books about it			1
but in the early to mid- ' 90s , it was n't always an easy sell			1
" when i would show people the web on dial - up , you 'd whip out a laptop and dial up with a 14.4k modem , " he said			1
" the page might take a minute or two or three or five to come down			2
you could see the hasher lines coming across from left to right as the page would slowly load			2
" people would look at this and say , ' why is this interesting ? ' " invented by @entity76 , the @entity4 made accessing the @entity77 ( no , they 're not the same thing ) easier for millions			1
" the really early users were total geeks , " @entity80 said			1
" they had to know coding			0
they had to know sophisticated prompts to get information from different places			0
they had to tell their computers so they would know exactly where to go			0
" that started changing as folks started opening their mailboxes and finding discs from web - portal services like @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			1
but even that more - accessible @entity77 was a far cry from what we know today			0
" it was mostly a text experience that was dominated , to some degree , by websites of major publishers who were just trying to use this new platform to essentially replicate what they already had , " @entity80 said			1
" @entity0 was basically what was on television			0
the @entity110 was basically what was in the paper			0
" take a look at early versions of some of today 's most popular websites , and the contrast is stark			1
now , the homepage for the @entity119 features an elegant design that incorporates hundreds of links to videos , photo galleries , podcasts and other media			0
in 1996 , the same url took you to a stretched - out glob of black text on a plain white background , topped by the oh - so - catchy headline " search @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and web pages			1
" go to @entity136 today , and you can scroll through a 95 - image gallery of links to news stories , choose from a list of links to trending topics , check on your stocks or jump straight to @entity136 - owned services like @entity146 and @entity147			0
time warp to 1996 , and there 's not a photo to be seen			0
@entity136 's homepage featured little more than a pile of hyperlinks that left half the page blank			0
oh , and that movie you streamed last night ? or the song it took you 20 seconds to download from @entity158 or @entity159 ? few web users were even dreaming about them			1
" if you had a music player or other streaming device , it was very scratchy , " @entity80 said			0
there were lots of hiccups in the server			0
but people lived with that because it was kind of exciting to have it happening in the first place			2
for web pioneers , and those who followed soon behind , experimenting with its emerging capabilities was , in part , its own reward			2
" it 's like coffee culture versus tea culture , " he said			0
" with coffee , you 're gulping it down , trying to get your caffeine			0
tea culture is more sipping and experiencing the taste			0
" we had a sipping culture back then , and now we have a gulping culture			0
that 's the big change			0
it was a small number of geeks who were tasting this concept for the first time			0
we were getting little bits			0
we were tasting them , and we were saying , ' how could this change the world ? ' "			0

early web *adopters* recall the slower , simpler online life of the ' 90s
@entity76 created the @entity4 in march 1989
slow connections limited what websites could deliver
but in the ' 90s , just being able to access the @entity4 was exciting for many
