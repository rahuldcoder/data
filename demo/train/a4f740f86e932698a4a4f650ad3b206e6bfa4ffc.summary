-- parents who are concerned about drinking and other risky behavior often try to steer their teenage children away from friends and dating partners whom they consider " bad influences			1
" those parents may want to look one step further : a new study suggests that teenagers with a new boyfriend or girlfriend tend to be more influenced by the drinking habits of their romantic partner 's friends than they are by the partners themselves			1
why ? dating introduces adolescents to new and different social networks and also creates a kind of indirect peer pressure , says lead researcher @entity25 , @entity26 , an associate professor of crime , law , and justice at @entity30 , in @entity30			0

when teenagers begin dating , they tend to meet in the middle when it comes to habits like drinking			2
if a teen girl who has yet to experiment with alcohol starts dating a boy who drinks often , for instance , the boy is likely to cut back while the girl is likely to give drinking a try			2
" he has an incentive to change , to be more like her , " @entity25 explains			0
" on the other hand , his friends do n't really have any reason to change , so they continue drinking			2

these social patterns may be even more important among teenagers , says @entity92 , @entity93 , program and research director of the adolescent health center at the @entity97 , in @entity98			0
" it 's during adolescence that kids start exploring adult behavior and adult roles , and looking for acceptance and respect , " she says			0
" and throughout high school , a child 's peer groups will change dramatically based on the new behaviors they pick up and the new people they encounter			2
" @entity0 : @entity113 , friends are big influence on drinking in the study , which was published in the @entity117 , @entity25 and his colleagues analyzed questionnaires from 898 students that were collected as part of a larger national survey on adolescent health			1
when the students were in seventh through twelfth grade , researchers interviewed the kids about drinking and binge drinking ( among other health - related behaviors ) , and also asked them to name several of their close friends at school , many of whom were also study participants			1
in a follow - up interview two years later , the same students answered similar questions and were also asked to name special romantic partners from the past 18 months			0
by identifying pairs of students who became a couple and comparing their survey responses , the researchers were able to see how the teens ' social networks and drinking habits changed over time			1
@entity0 : binge drinking may harm learning , memory they found that younger teenagers tend to socialize with friends of the same gender , and that being involved in romantic relationships often introduces them to mixed - gender peer groups			2
and while friends and significant others both influenced the future drinking habits of the study participants , it was the second - degree friends of partners that had the strongest influence on drinking frequency and binge drinking			1
the findings may not be news to parents , @entity25 says			0
but they do emphasize the need to learn more about the group of people their children 's romantic partners -- and therefore their children -- may be spending time with			1
parents should talk with their children about peer pressure and alcohol abuse even before they begin dating , says @entity92 , so that as teenagers they can recognize potential hazards in new social situations			0
they should also make an effort to get to know a new romantic partner in their teen 's life , as well as that partner 's friends			1

adolescents can also be swayed in a positive direction by peer groups who drink less than they do -- especially boys , who , according to the study , were more likely to binge drink , and who may be more susceptible to a significant other 's influences			2

study says teens will be influenced more by new partner 's friends ' habits
@entity113 and friends can " spread " obesity , drinking , smoking , and even happiness
