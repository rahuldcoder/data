-- four men behind what officials describe as the most serious @entity5 terrorist plot ever hatched in @entity6 were convicted of the plot monday in a courthouse in @entity9 , just outside of @entity10 , @entity11			1
three @entity13 nationals and a @entity15 resident of @entity13 were found guilty of targeting @entity16 , the @entity10 - based newspaper responsible for publishing controversial cartoons of the @entity18			1
the court ruled there was no doubt about their plan to attack and sentenced each of the men to 12 years in prison			1
counterterrorism officials in the @entity27 and @entity6 believe the plot was directed by @entity30 operatives in @entity31			0
authorities contend the four suspects planned a gun attack on the newspaper , to be followed by " the execution " of hostages			1
it is possible a reception due to be attended by @entity11 's crown prince in the same building as the newspaper was the intended target , a prosecutor said in court			1
the reception was to be held hours after the terrorist cell was arrested , but the prosecutor said there was no evidence the men were specifically targeting the crown prince			1
the cell 's plans were thwarted by a joint operation of @entity13 and @entity11 security services , which tracked the suspects in december 2010 as they drove from @entity13 to @entity11 with a submachine gun , a silencer , and several dozen 9mm submachine gun cartridges , authorities say			1
the four men convicted -- @entity62 , 46 , a @entity15 citizen ; @entity63 , 31 , of @entity65 descent ; @entity66 , 39 , of @entity15 descent ; and @entity68 , 32 , of @entity70 descent -- are charged with plotting to kill a large number of people at the newspaper			1
they have denied the charges			0
western security services believe the plot was part of a broader @entity30 conspiracy , authorized by @entity80 , to strike @entity81 with operations mirroring the @entity84 , @entity85 , attack in november 2008 , which killed nearly 200 people			1
@entity62 , the suspected ringleader of the cell , @entity63 , and @entity66 had all traveled to @entity31 in early 2010			0
@entity63 and @entity66 , traveling separately , were arrested by @entity31 authorities in august 2010 before they could reach the @entity91 region and were subsequently deported , according to a @entity13 counterterrorism source			2
during the trial , prosecutors pointed to a map showing @entity96 in @entity91 and told the jury the plot had links to @entity31 , according to @entity100 , a reporter for @entity102 newspaper , who attended the proceedings			2
but while the court ruled that @entity62 spent time in @entity91 , few details emerged in court on his movements there			0
the court heard that @entity66 admitted to @entity13 police he wired money from @entity13 via @entity112 to @entity113 in @entity114 , a town bordering @entity91 , according to @entity100			0
@entity62 evaded capture in @entity31 , and he is believed to have received training there prior to returning to @entity81 shortly before the group began to plot their attack , according to the source			2
at trial , it was revealed that @entity62 traveled back from @entity31 through @entity122 and @entity123 , where @entity66 picked him up in a car			0
according to prosecutors , they then traveled to @entity10 to case targets including the @entity16 before traveling on to @entity128			0
@entity63 , the @entity65 - born suspect , had long been on the radar screen of @entity13 counterterrorism services			0
he was suspected of having joined up with jihadist militants in @entity132 in 2006 before fleeing the country when @entity135 troops launched a military operation against @entity5 militants there , according to a @entity11 security source			1
by october 2010 , @entity13 security services had begun tracking the cell , placing listening devices in the men 's apartments			2
a @entity13 counterterrorism source told @entity0 the group did not settle on attacking the newspaper until shortly before the planned attack , and often squabbled			1
prosecutors stated that in the weeks before the plot was thwarted , there were 75 calls from a sim card used by @entity62 to a number in @entity31 linked to " @entity154 , " an individual suspected of involvement in terrorist activity			0
in court monday , state prosecutor @entity157 argued the men deserved a significant prison sentence because they were " fulfilling a task ordered from @entity31 " and came close to carrying out their operation , according to @entity100			1
on the evening of december 28 , 2010 , three of the cell members set off from @entity128 in a rental car with @entity62 at the wheel , authorities said			2
security services continuously monitored their progress , including from the air			0
@entity66 bailed from the journey at the last minute , and was later arrested in @entity128 , according to court documents			0
the court heard that after his arrest , he claimed to @entity13 police he was aware that @entity62 -- his best friend -- and the others were planning an attack on the @entity16 newspaper , but wanted out , according to @entity100			1
taking the stand in court , @entity66 said that at the time he only suspected a possible plot and had thought about calling police to alert them of his concerns after getting out of the car in @entity13 , @entity100 said			0
it was just after 2 a.m. when the vehicle carrying the other cell members crossed the iconic @entity188 connecting the two countries , authorities say			2
when they reached @entity10 , they were initially unable to find the address where they planned to sleep			2
just after 10 a.m. on december 29 , @entity11 police , concerned the men might be about to try launch their operation , moved in to make the arrests			1
authorities say officials had already taken precautions			2
when they learned the group was planning to travel to @entity11 , they secretly disabled their weapons , according to a @entity13 counterterrorism source			1
plastic wrist strips were also found in their car , according to court documents , and security services said they believed the materials were going to be used to handcuff hostages			0
security services believe the plan was to try to take up to 200 journalists hostage at the newspaper and execute many of them , a @entity13 counterterrorism source told @entity0			1
the equivalent of $ 20,000 in cash was also recovered from the suspects , and a pistol and ammunition were found in one of their apartments , according to court documents			0
a @entity13 counterterrorism source has told @entity0 that investigations have revealed a complex set of connections between the plotters and a network linked to @entity232 , a senior @entity31 @entity30 operative who @entity234 intelligence believe orchestrated @entity30 's plans to hit @entity81 with @entity84 - style attacks			0
@entity62 and @entity63 had a connection to " @entity238 , " a @entity128 - based militant of @entity241 descent who is suspected of acting as facilitator for @entity245 's terrorist network , according to a @entity13 counterterrorism source			0
at trial , the prosecutor stated that in the days before the cell set off for @entity13 , @entity62 was in touch by phone five times with @entity238 , using @entity66 's phone			0
also involved with @entity232 's network was @entity255 , an @entity27 of @entity31 descent who pleaded guilty two years ago to helping plot the @entity84 attacks			2
according to an interview of @entity255 by @entity85 's @entity261 that was obtained by @entity0 , @entity255 met with @entity238 in 2009 in relation to a plot @entity255 himself was planning against the @entity16 newspaper			0
the newspaper and its cartoonists have been targeted by several plots in recent years , including one by a @entity269 @entity30 cell that was broken up in july 2010			1
@entity232 was reported killed in a drone strike in june 2011			0
an attack strategy document seized on an alleged @entity30 recruit in @entity273 last spring indicates the terrorist group still hopes to launch a gun and hostage execution attack in @entity81 because of the publicity and fear such attacks would create .			1

each of the four is sentenced to 12 years in prison
