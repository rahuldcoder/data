achilles ' heel was his weak spot in the @entity4 myth , but the heel of a newly discovered primate provides a strong connection between humans and their possible ancestors			1
scientists have discovered the oldest primate skeleton to date , from a creature that resembles humans ' evolutionary line -- the anthropoids -- and a different primate lineage called the tarsiers			1
they have named this specimen @entity19 achilles , making reference to its heel bone , which resembles those of modern monkeys			1
anthropoids include humans , apes and monkeys			1
tarsiers are nocturnal primates that live only in @entity30 today			1
the study is published in the journal @entity33			0
" for the first time , it really shines a light on an important phase of primate and human evolution that we just had very little information about before , " said @entity34 , paleontologist at the @entity35 and senior author of the study			1
the specimen 's completeness , age and position in the primate family tree make it special , said @entity52 , associate professor at @entity53 , who was not involved in the study			1
giant extinct lizard named for @entity57 " in my opinion , it is one of the most important discoveries in the history of paleoprimatology , " @entity52 said in an e-mail			0
while fragments of other ancient primates have been found in the past , this skeleton -- about 55 million years old -- is by far the most complete example of a primate from this period , @entity34 said			1
archicebus achilles represents a never - before - seen link between the anthropoids and the tarsiers , @entity34 said , but he expects the creature 's exact position on the evolutionary tree to be quite controversial			1
some of its features suggest to his group that it is slightly more closely related to tarsiers than to anthropoids , but other scientists may reach different conclusions			1
still , he said , it seems to be clearly related to both groups			0
" @entity19 ( achilles ) gives us our first really detailed look at a species that branched off right near the base of the primate family tree -- when anthropoids , tarsiers , and lemurs had just started out on their separate evolutionary pathways , " @entity52 said			1
this creature was tiny -- only 2.8 inches long -- and weighed no more than 1 ounce , making it between the size of a shrew and a mouse			0
will mammoths be brought back to life ? liquid blood fuels cloning hopes scientists find the small size fascinating because until about a decade ago , researchers believed that anthropoids needed to be a lot bigger , @entity34 said			1
but there are counterexamples , even today : the pygmy mouse lemur , found in @entity114 , weighs only about an ounce as well			0
a creature so tiny must have been " active and frenetic , " @entity34 said			0
shrews , for instance , act anxious because they are always looking for their next meal , since they need a lot of food for their high metabolic rate			0
archicebus achilles , being small , probably also had a high metabolism , and likely ate high - calorie foods such as insects and very ripe fruits with lots of sugar content			2
" when you 're that small , you ca n't afford to eat salad , " @entity34 said			0
" you ca n't ingest enough calories rapidly enough to keep your body going			0
" unlike modern tarsiers , @entity19 achilles was active during the day			1
@entity136 also tend to have eyeballs that are the same volume as their brains , whereas this ancient creature had relatively small eye sockets compared to its face -- an attribute of monkeys			2
triceratops trio unearthed in @entity146 the creature 's foot made a big impression on @entity34 because of how much it resembles the feet of modern - day marmosets			1
its features are much more like those of a monkey than a tarsier			2
on the other hand , other features -- the hip , knee , elbow and pelvis -- more closely resemble a tarsier			2
paleontologists ca n't say that this specific creature is the ancestor of humans and tarsiers , but this is the best approximation so far of something resembling a hypothetical common ancestor , he said			2
@entity19 achilles was discovered in an ancient lake in @entity174 province , @entity175 , at a site called the lower @entity177 , in the @entity179 area			1
the scientists plan on going back and looking for more , but it 's hard work			2
they were lucky to have found this creature , @entity34 said			0
it must have died near the lake and then its carcass was swept into the lake , perhaps by a stream			0
the body settled at the bottom , covered up by mud which then hardened			0
for researchers digging at this site , ancient fish fossils are far more likely to turn up than primates , " which is cool -- fossil fish are cool			2
i like fossil fish , but i 'm not an expert on fossil fish , " @entity34 added			0
but if you 're looking for ancient mammals at this site , " you have to have an incredible amount of patience because it 's probably going to be years before you find something that 's really , really exciting			0
but when you do , you hit the jackpot			0
