-- so people are either surprised or snarky about @entity2 going onto @entity3 to find a guy			1
what did they think she was going to do : make a man out of paper @entity8 or cookie dough ? stars and celebrities are no different from anyone else			2
when they get over a certain age , they stop meeting eligible partners			1
if a woman does meet someone compelling at a party , she does n't know if he 's available or just wants to play			2
if she meets him at the office , it might be too complicated			0
but in general , when men and women get over 50 , the odds of just bumping into @entity27 or mr. @entity28 are n't in their favor			1
so the really committed ones go hunting where the odds are better , and that 's online			1
@entity35 famously responded to the question of why he robbed banks by stating , " because that 's where the money is			2
" well , that 's why boomers are flocking to the web : other 50 plusers who are looking for love are there			1
by the way , i do n't use the verb flocking loosely ; just about every site , @entity52 , @entity53 , com , ok @entity55 and more , report the biggest jump in new people joining their sites are in the 50 and over crowd			1
but let 's not stop at the rise in numbers on the @entity63			1
let 's go to the more interesting fact : they are going online to find love , passion and sex			1
there , i 've said it : middle - aged men and women and people old enough to be thanked by @entity75 on the " today " show still want it all			1
they want to cuddle , kiss , hold hands , get touched in erotic zones and have intercourse			0
and they do n't want you to think that 's cute or optional			0
their sexual and emotional needs do n't die before they do			0
in fact , a lot of medical evidence indicates that if they do have physical affection , love and sex they will live longer			1
but if most of these men and women waited for their friends to fix them up or for someone to approach them on the street , they 'd most likely be alone forever			2
and they do n't want to be			0
at 50 they could have another 50 years together			0
or they could have 10 rewarding years			0
i have friends that have been together for four years , since she was 83 and he was 86			0
they go back and forth and stay with each other in their assisted living apartments			0
they are in love and no less in love , and in no less fabulous a manner , than when they were with their late spouses			0
so do n't sneer at @entity2 , at least not for online dating			1
applaud her for her bravery and knowing what she wants , without letting pride get in the way			0
i hope she serves as a role model for all those older men and women whose amorous and romantic ambitions have been stifled for fear of ridicule			1
" ' what will my friends say , " they ask me , " if they see me on senior friend finder or @entity132 ? " my answer is : they will say " good for you			0
" at least that 's what my friends said when i went online			2
and then they said , " congratulations , " when i fell in love and got engaged			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity142 .			2

@entity142 : people seem surprised or make fun of @entity2 for online dating
but like everyone else , famous people over 50 stop meeting eligible partners , she says
@entity142 says middle - aged men and women need physical affection , love . it 's *healthy*
@entity142 hopes @entity161 's example *encourages* others who have been *afraid* of ridicule
