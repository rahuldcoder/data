-- @entity1 should be skiing this week			1
instead he postponed a trip to @entity3 because the snow situation just is n't looking good			1
" we 've been keeping a close eye on the weather the last few weeks and keeping our fingers crossed , hoping for some good snow and it just got to the point where we decided it 's better to reschedule and pay to change our plans than to go out there and be disappointed , " said @entity1 , who was planning to fly from @entity5 to meet up with friends at @entity7			1
now they 're planning to go in february			0
it is a decision faced by skiers and snowboarders across the @entity21 as ski resorts scramble to make the snow that @entity24 is n't providing			1
december 2011 yielded the 11th least extensive snow cover in the @entity21 in the past 46 years , according to climatologist @entity26 , a professor in the geography department at @entity28			1
weather patterns are moving in and out too quickly and nothing is locking in to produce significant snowfall , he said			2
" it does n't look like there 's going to be huge improvement the next two weeks and we 're getting halfway through winter by then			0
but still , hope springs eternal for late january into early march			0
one would expect that we 're going to see at least some interruption in this progressive fast - moving pattern , " @entity26 said			0
any snow would be a welcome change for the @entity43 area straddling @entity44 and @entity45 , where odd spring - like weather has plagued snow seekers			1
base snow averaged about 14 inches at seven area resorts on thursday , with summit averages of a little more than 19 inches			1
the annual average summit snowfall at one of the resorts is 350 inches			1
revenue at some @entity44 resorts over the peak week between @entity57 and @entity58 's was down 20 % to 30 % after a tremendous ski season across the @entity21 last year , according to estimates from the @entity61			1
it 's no good for skiers , but the warm weather is pleasant , said local restaurant manager @entity65			1
" it 's just gorgeous			0
people are paddle - boarding and hiking and riding their bikes , so they 're definitely in town hanging out , " said @entity65 , who manages the @entity67 © in @entity68 , @entity44			0
lack of the cold white stuff actually brought a boost to the @entity77 's business in the past few weeks , she said			0
" we 're really busy because ( visitors are ) not skiing			0
" people who would usually be on the trails all day are skiing in the morning and then coming into town , @entity65 said , but she suspects the novelty of the warm weather will wear off for vacationers			1
ski resorts in other parts of the @entity87 did n't experience such steep declines in december business			1
in @entity3 and @entity91 , revenue was down by single digit percentages over the holiday week , said @entity93 , president of the @entity61			2
holiday bookings at major destination resorts are usually made before the start of the season			2
with the lack of snow going into january , some potential customers are hanging back to see what happens , @entity93 said			2
" we are a weather - dependent industry , no matter what , and we 've done lots of things to help mitigate it , but at the end of the day , it 's always nice to have @entity24 's help , " he said			2
some of @entity3 's biggest resorts -- like @entity112 and @entity113 -- are surviving on high altitude , cold temperatures and enough money to produce a lot of man - made snow , said @entity120 , content director of snow sports website @entity121			1
ski areas are trying to make the best of it			2
@entity112 / @entity128 ceo @entity127 penned a blog post this week titled " the @entity130 is @entity131 " highlighting some of the best trail conditions , and a @entity134 comment complaining about attractive photos of " fake snow " on the resort 's page received this upbeat response : " yep - sometimes we 've got to lend a hand when @entity24 is being fickle			1
sure beats doing nothing , right ? " @entity143 , which owns six resorts in @entity3 and @entity44 , is looking at a .6 % increase in total lift ticket revenue from the start of the season in november through the beginning of january over the same period last year , according to ceo @entity150			2
@entity150 said that slight uptick after last year 's incredible season is due in large part to the company 's investment in snowmaking and family - friendly activities and amenities			0
so while a lot of expert terrain is closed , the intermediate terrain is available to vacationing families			0
" for an expert skier who wants to ski everything , no question , they come and they say ' hey , this is n't as good as it was last year , ' absolutely , " @entity150 said			2
despite a very slow start to the ski season , there are a few brighter spots , @entity120 said			1
western storm systems have split to the far north and south of the country , so conditions in @entity178 , @entity179 and southern @entity3 in the south and the @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 are looking pretty good			1
" we ca n't complain certainly , " said @entity184 , a spokeswoman for @entity185			0
resorts in @entity185 got 20 to 35 inches of fresh snow during the last week of december			1
the state 's resorts are aware of their luck compared with many other areas of the country , she said			2
" we 've been there before , " @entity184 said			0
" we 've been the ones with no snow			2
" not so compassionate is @entity197 in @entity198 , which is taking a run at @entity143 ' business with an offer of free lift tickets to holders of the company 's @entity204 , which allows unlimited access to all six @entity113 - owned resorts in @entity3 and @entity44			0
@entity204 holders must book lodging through @entity197 to be eligible for free skiing			0
still , there 's no bounty of deals , and the @entity215 user community is n't happy paying full price for poor conditions , @entity120 said			0
" considering the state of the snow , you do n't see as many discounts as you think you might			0
but this is also when ( resorts ) make all their money			0
" things have " turned the corner " at ski areas east of the @entity228 after a 10 % to 15 % slump in holiday week revenue , said @entity93 of the @entity61			1
there has been some natural snow in some areas this week and colder temperatures mean resorts are " making snow like crazy			1
" people in the ski business have their fingers crossed for recovery across the country			0
lack of snow affects livelihoods as well as vacation plans			0
" it 's a big big deal for our little industry , " @entity120 said .			0
