-- drawing level with the " @entity2 " saga and pulling well ahead of " @entity4 , " " @entity5 " and " @entity6 " in the sequel stakes , " @entity12 " could yet challenge @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 for longevity			1
so what 's the appeal ? combining heist movie suspense with regular high - speed chase action , " @entity17 " takes " @entity21 " downtown , swapping con men for street racers , suits for vests and hair gel for grease ( @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 are all chrome domes now )			1
where @entity30 aimed for suave and sophisticated , this unpretentious franchise sticks with stunts and sweatpants			1
but unlike @entity34 , who ham - fistedly satirized a testosterone - fueled abs and @entity38 culture in " @entity39 , " these pumped up b - movies are n't condescending to their multiethnic , working - class characters or their audience			2
instead , they celebrate the loyalty and brotherhood of that outlaw extended family unit , the gang			1
these criminals do n't have time for traffic regulations , but they still operate under a strict code of their own , a code that echoes @entity55 ' famous motto for " @entity56 : " all for one and one for all			2
under director @entity59 and screenwriter @entity60 ( who has penned the last four episodes ) , the series has hit on a mock - serious , car - toony groove that 's hard to resist			2
even @entity63 , who was killed in the fourth flick , is back in " furious 6 , " a hook to lure @entity66 and crew out of retirement and onto special agent @entity70 ' team			1
@entity63 's @entity71 has been spotted riding in a looky - likey criminal outfit ( " they 're our evil twins ! " ) led by a ruthless ex-british @entity75 soldier , @entity74 ( @entity74 )			2
if @entity78 and @entity79 ( @entity80 ) help @entity70 take @entity74 down , they can win immunity for @entity71 and for themselves			0
set largely in @entity82 -- congestion - plagued brits will scoff at a street race that loops around @entity85 and wonder how many pedestrians were sacrificed in the making of this movie -- the film imports a @entity91 - style threat in the form of a military " @entity94 " device			1
the device is the kind of thing that can not be allowed to fall into the wrong hands ( which @entity74 's definitely are			0
) if the set up is farfetched and the acting more willing than able , you have to give the producers credit for putting the budget up on the screen			0
each of the extended cast gets his or her moment to shine , and whether it 's @entity27 and @entity108 trading quips , @entity109 and @entity110 shooting flirty looks or @entity63 duking it out with " @entity113 " alum @entity112 in a convincingly crunchy catfight , there may well be something for just about anyone here			1
but it 's the action set pieces everyone will be talking about			1
and if " @entity124 " set the bar pretty high with that train stunt and the safe - dragging climax , " @entity121 " is more than ready to up the ante with still bigger , and clunkier , modes of transportation			0
i do n't want to say too much , but for some reason i kept having flashbacks to " @entity131 " during the preposterously elongated climax			0
( not a criticism , just that you would n't be surprised if @entity135 rode to the rescue on @entity137 in one of the outtakes			0
) ludicrous , but undeniably fun and surprisingly affectionate , this is really all you could ask of a car crash movie , and more			0
stick through the end credits for a satisfying coda .			0

the " @entity17 " franchise is back for round 6
this go around the action takes place mostly in @entity82
each of the extended cast get their moment to shine
