@entity0 -- who needs the @entity3 -- or has time for them , anyway -- when " keeping up with the @entity5 " is so entertaining			0
@entity6 raises the idea that @entity8 suffered a traumatic brain injury , and the debate rages : @entity13 low blow reckless gossip nugget ? @entity15 a legitimate point about her health and her transparency ? @entity19 are so afraid of her they are getting hyper - tough now , hoping she chooses the calm of civilian life ? @entity24 of the above ? as you debate that , consider this sage observation from @entity27 , the former president who for decades now has reveled in dishing out political advice and analysis : " you ca n't get too upset about it			1
it 's just the beginning			2
they will get better at it			0
" speaking in his signature raspy drawl , laughing the entire time , he also worked in a priceless nugget that reminds us the @entity5 know hardball , and are hard to surprise no matter how loud , low , or legitimate the attack : " i 'm still waiting for them to admit there was nothing to @entity45			2
it 's just part of the deal			2
" @entity27 : @entity48 was a communist compared to modern @entity50 too young to get the @entity45 reference ? try your favorite internet search engine			1
or call an @entity55 real estate agent and suggest you are looking for a nostalgic vacation retreat			0
@entity58 strategist @entity57 , a veteran of both @entity27 campaigns who remains a family confidant , offered this take on the @entity5 - dominated political week : " the @entity5 learned a long time ago that no matter what they do , the kook right will attack them and the media will cover them			1
" " @entity6 was being stupid , not smart			1
his comments anger principled conservatives and engender support for @entity8 , both among the @entity6 - hating @entity58 base and the smear - hating center			1
@entity73 , if i know @entity8 , @entity6 's cheap shot makes her more likely to run , not less -- which is something @entity6 does not want			1
" details aside , it was a week to remember that -- love them or not -- the @entity5 are a formidable political team			0
and a week , or maybe two weeks , of building the list of questions , both policy and personal , awaiting a @entity27 2016 campaign			1
@entity81 : attacks make @entity8 stronger from @entity84 to @entity85 , there were fresh assertions from @entity50 that citizen @entity27 often exaggerates her successes or ignores her shortcomings as secretary of state			1
@entity90 , a @entity50 group that critiques secretary @entity27 on a near - daily , sometimes hourly basis , was quick on thursday to distribute a report from @entity93 of the @entity94 that led with this : " @entity8 is now claiming to be the architect of crippling sanctions on the @entity99 economy			1
but during her tenure as secretary of state , her department repeatedly opposed or tried to water down an array of sanctions measures that were pushed into law by @entity58 and @entity50 in @entity106			2
" a pattern of avoiding the reality of her record , @entity90 suggested , noting recent @entity27 statements about @entity112 and the @entity114 kidnapping it said could not be squared with her actions at @entity117			2
rove attacks show @entity50 's concerns about @entity27 @entity27 stepped up this past week as his wife 's chief defender , specifically addressing @entity84 but suggesting she did all she could , and then adding that @entity50 never talk about the deaths at overseas diplomatic outposts during the @entity125 administration			1
@entity6 's " @entity127 " suggestion was first reported by the @entity128 , with a dramatic headline suggesting the @entity50 strategist had suggested she had brain damage			1
" i never used that phrase , " @entity6 said on @entity132			2
still over the line if , as reported , he suggested she had some lasting traumatic brain injury			1
cleaning up his language later is a time - tested method of attack politics : say something provocative to plant a seed -- and start the conversation -- and then stage a rhetorical retreat filled with softer language			0
but @entity6 's broader point is legitimate : if she runs for president , secretary @entity27 will face enormous pressure to release more details about her december 2012 fall and concussion			1
@entity27 guaranteed that this week even as he shrugged off the @entity6 attack			1
" first they say she faked her concussion and now they say she is auditioning for a part on ' @entity159 , ' " the former president said			0
but he went on to say this , proving this was no minor fall : " she had sustained what was a terrible concussion			0
required six months of very serious work to get over			0
" the former president said his wife , " never low - balled " the severity of her injury with the @entity169 people			0
@entity170 slams " @entity50 consultant class " perhaps not , but she never discussed it in great detail , either			2
in a january 2013 interview with @entity175 , she said : " i still have some lingering effects from falling on my head and having the blood clot			0
but , you know , the doctors tell me that that will all recede			0
and so thankfully i 'm , you know , looking forward to being at full speed			0
... i have some lingering effects from the concussion that are decreasing and will disappear			0
but i have a lot of sympathy now when i pick up the paper and read about an athlete or one of our soldiers who 's had traumatic brain injury			1
i 'd never had anything like that in my family			0
and so , you know , i 'm very conscious of how lucky i was			0
" if she is a candidate for president , she will be asked for her medical records , and to make her doctors available			0
those questions are not ageist or sexist , but routine			0
as the @entity6 - @entity27 drama played out , and most everyone in @entity0 took @entity27 's vocal and aggressive defense of his wife as more proof she will run , @entity201 of @entity202 weighed in with a thoughtful look at the constant @entity27 speculation			1
he took issue with reporters and pundits who see all the stories and maneuverings as carefully orchestrated from within @entity215			0
" what we 're really looking at is a campaign orchestrated by nervous @entity58 and aimed at persuading @entity27 herself , " @entity201 writes			2
" the truth is that , leaving aside all this bravado about happy demographics and the disunion of @entity50 , @entity58 are scared out of their minds right now			2
the @entity225 is solidly out of reach			0
the @entity227 is slipping away			0
and the @entity225 could be close behind , especially if @entity27 does n't run , and if @entity50 can rally around a credible candidate			1
a leading reason so many @entity58 jumped to endorse @entity8 so early is that they believe only someone as formidable as her can keep the @entity225 in @entity58 hands after two @entity233 terms , it 's part of what makes the @entity8 chatter so fascinating			1
and remember , to borrow that line again from @entity27 : " it 's just the beginning			1

@entity50 strategist @entity6 asked if @entity8 had suffered brain injury
@entity27 laughed off @entity6 's attack , saying , " they **'ll** get better at it "
@entity27 confidant thinks the " cheap shot " makes it more likely that she **'ll** run
