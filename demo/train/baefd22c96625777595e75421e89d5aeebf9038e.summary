the @entity0 will review its policies on hairstyles following backlash from @entity5 - @entity5 soldiers , who said the @entity7 's revised rules are racially and culturally biased			1
defense secretary @entity9 has notified @entity10 that he has directed his deputy to " work with the service secretaries and the military chiefs to review their respective policies , to address the issues raised by members of @entity10 about grooming standards , particularly for @entity5 females , " @entity0 spokesman @entity8 said this week			1
over the next month , the military will take a close look at the " the definitions of authorized and prohibited hairstyles contained in each of their respective policies and revise any offensive language , " @entity8 said			0
" during the next three months , each service will review their hairstyle policies as they pertain to @entity5 - @entity5 women to ensure standards are fair and respectful of our diverse force , while also meeting our military service 's requirements , " he said			1
@entity34 will tweak @entity0 policies accordingly after the reviews are completed , @entity8 added			2
the latest twist in the hairstyle saga follows an uproar over the @entity7 's new grooming guidelines			2
those rules require such things as hair " must be of uniform dimension , small in diameter ( approximately Â¼ inch ) , show no more than 1/8 ( inch ) of the scalp between the braids			0
" current @entity7 rules ban dreadlocks and twists of any kind as well as styles it views as " unkempt " or " matted			0
" that type of language rankled @entity5 - @entity5 soldiers , their supporters and the female members of the @entity59 , who said the guidelines force @entity5 - @entity5 women with " natural " hair textures â € ” those unaltered by heat or chemicals â € ” to either cut or straighten their roots in order to conform to the @entity7 's rules and mainstream cultural standards			1
one @entity5 female soldier started an online @entity71 petition , which received more than 13,000 signatures and is no longer on the website			2
the @entity7 's rules also touched on centuries old cultural identity politics that have been a sensitive issue for the black community since slavery			2
during that time , and for the generations that followed , straighter hair texture and lighter skin complexion was used to classify which slaves were more valuable and seen as more attractive , @entity5 - @entity5 scholars noted			1
those values , once internalized , damaged self - esteem and were perpetuated within the black community for years , those experts said			0
the @entity7 had previously rejected criticism of its policies as discriminatory since @entity5 - @entity5 women helped craft the new regulations			1
those guidelines regulate the style of hair parts , braid width and hair thickness			0
the female members of the @entity59 also wrote @entity34 earlier this month criticizing the @entity7 's new guidelines as " discriminatory rules targeting soldiers who are women of color with little regard to what is needed to maintain their natural hair			1
" those who objected to the regulations applauded @entity34 's intervention			0
" members of the @entity59 appreciate @entity34 for his prompt response to our letter and for seriously considering our concerns , " chairwoman rep. chair @entity106 , an @entity108 @entity107 , said in a written statement			0
" the secretary 's response affirms his commitment to ensuring all individuals are welcomed and can continue to be proud of serving within our armed forces			0
