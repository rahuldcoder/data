-- for once in @entity2 , aging is seen as a majestic , magical thing			1
with the new movie " boyhood , " writer / director @entity4 has created something wholly unusual : he took 12 years to film and finish the project , and its central conceit is watching a young boy , @entity13 , go from child to young man as his older sister and parents have their own maturation , too			1
yet rather than tell the usual " first " stories , @entity4 zeroes in on those moments in - between the typical life milestones , creating something that resonates as emotionally and visually authentic			1
critics have fallen in love with the new release , which earned a 100 % score on @entity26			0
" boyhood " will roll out slowly in select cities across the @entity28 starting july 11			2
star @entity30 , who plays the dad in " @entity33 's " story , says it 's truly unlike anything he 's ever done -- and unlike anything you 've ever seen			2
" everything is kind of in the spirit of something else , " @entity38 told @entity0 , listing some of his biggest hits			0
" ' @entity43 ' is like ' @entity44 , ' ... ' @entity45 ' is like ' @entity46 , ' ' @entity47 ' is like ' @entity48			0
' " but " boyhood " ? " this is n't like anything , " @entity38 said			2
the 43 - year - old actor plays the father of @entity13 , who 's portrayed over the 12 - year span by @entity55			1
@entity56 plays @entity13 's mom , and @entity4 's daughter , @entity58 , plays @entity13 's older sister			1
" i was trying to tell a story about growing up , and i could n't really pick a moment ... all my ideas were spread over the years , " @entity4 told @entity0			1
" i 'd kind of given up , ( and ) that 's when this epiphany hit me : ' oh , i could film a little bit ( each year ) , that could work			2
' " that is a long commitment , both for the actors and the filmmaker , but on the other hand , it 's also a snapshot of the past 12 years of their lives , captured in the frames of a single film			1
for @entity56 , that was one of the big draws			0
" that 's part of what i was excited about with the whole premise , " she said			2
" ( m ) e and @entity30 would be getting older , and in @entity2 there is such a pressure to not age and you 're supposed to look a certain way , and it 's a false pretense			2
i wanted to really ignore all of that			0
" watching the movie back is a bit surreal , @entity38 added			0
" it 's a very strange thing -- the kids grow up and we age , " he said			0
" we are watching them bloom as we are watching us wilt , you know ? it 's powerful			0
" to create that effect , @entity56 , @entity38 and the rest of the cast had to put full trust in @entity102 , since there was n't a completed script			0
when @entity4 pulled his cast together , there was no way of knowing what the future would hold for his characters			1
while most coming - of - age stories are set in a specific period and have a script that can detail that story from the outset of production , @entity4 's had to leave an " openness " to it , @entity56 said			1
" maybe in 12 years we 'd have a war and kids would be having to enlist and his friends would be dying , " she continued			1
" we did n't know what was going to be happening -- he could be a football player , and go in that direction			0
" it sounds like an incredible gamble of money and time , especially without the certainty that @entity55 , who was just 6 when the film began production , would even be the right casting choice by the time they reached the story 's end			0
" i realize 12 years later why it had n't been done before , " @entity4 joked			1
" it 's a wildly impractical , rather insane idea			0
" but that 's how " boyhood , " as fictional as it is , is also an eerie reflection of real life			1
" you ca n't say exactly where you are going to be 12 years from now , you hope to be somewhere , if you 're not unlucky , " @entity4 said			1
" you just have to believe in the future , that we 'll be able to deal with the reality			0
" @entity0 's @entity145 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 's " boyhood " was filmed over 12 years
the actors *embraced* aging on *camera*
the script had to have an " openness " to allow for future changes
in that way , " boyhood " is reflective of life
