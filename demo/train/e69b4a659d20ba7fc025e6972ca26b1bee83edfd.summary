@entity0 , @entity1 -- to define someone as a looter is not simply to describe him , or her , through an act , it is to make a moral judgment			1
it is to characterize the person as lawless and criminal			1
it connotes someone who is without self - restraint ; an animal ; wanton and depraved			1
it is a description that is void of empathy for someone who is consciously or subconsciously viewed as " the other			2
" tragically , it fits into the stereotype that many have about people of @entity25 descent , be they african - americans or @entity28 - @entity27			1
the news media have to stop describing starving @entity28 who are simply trying to survive the earthquake and aftershocks that took their homes , their loved ones , and all their possessions by this highly derogatory term			1
it 's a lesson they should have learned covering the devastation wrought by @entity40			1
i remember the news accounts then that described black residents of @entity45 as " looters , " but used benign words to describe white residents engaged in the same action : taking things			1
academics have found repeated instances of this in media content analyses after disasters			1
one example , widely disseminated on the web post-katrina , juxtaposed an @entity59 photo that showed a young black man wading through chest - high water " after looting a grocery store " ( said the caption ) , with an @entity66 / @entity65 photo of a white woman in the same position , although the caption this time described her " finding " food " from a local grocery store			1
" it is time to put this practice to rest			2
put yourself in the position of the average @entity28 in @entity79			1
one minute you were going about your business , the next minute the earth shook and literally your world crumbled all around you			2
but you were one of the lucky ones , you survived the earthquake			2
your first thought is to cry out for your family , especially your kids			2
but most of your family is buried under a rubble pile somewhere			2
you had four children but only one survived the earthquake			2
you have spent the last few days , along with your fellow survivors , digging through the rubble trying to find them			2
it is now a week after the earthquake , and you have eaten little or nothing			2
you are hungry and thirsty , and while you hear rumors of aid coming , you have not seen any evidence of it			2
you have not heard from the president and indeed you 've heard rumors that his wife is dead			2
perhaps he left the country ; you would too , if you could			2
there is no police presence at all			2
no governmental authority to provide support			0
the only money you have are the few gourdes ( @entity28 dollars ) that you have in your pockets			1
the rest of your money is in the safe place you always kept it -- but it is now buried with your food			1
the banks are not open			0
there is no one to borrow from ; they are all in the same boat as you			0
there are no functioning institutions			0
you have family in the @entity27 and they are desperately trying to get you some help			0
they have contacted all of the big aid agencies , but those agencies have issues of their own			0
some have lost staff members			0
they are doing the best they can , but they have no idea that you exist and you have no way of finding them			0
the roads are impassable , and they ca n't get clearance from whoever is in charge of the airport to land their planes , which bring much needed supplies			0
they 're afraid to go anywhere without security because they 've heard that the people are becoming restless			0
indeed , though you do not know this , the @entity27 military is also worried that citizens will get violent and start stealing			0
the @entity161 is waiting for more troops , and the doctors have stopped treating patients because of those same fears : violence , looting			0
under normal circumstances you would not think of taking food without paying for it			1
you are what other @entity28 would call " bien eleve " not " mal eleve			1
" by that they mean you were well - raised , with manners and dignity			0
@entity28 put a strong premium on dignity			1
to take something for which you have not paid does not only offend your sense of legality but also your sense of personhood			0
but not only are you starving , so is your only surviving child			0
you would prefer to pay , but whom ? what would you pay with ? you 'd prefer to wait , but for whom ? how long can you afford to wait ? you feel that your desperate state is evidence that you have been abandoned by your family , your country , the international community , and @entity194 ( @entity195 )			1
( the @entity197 word for @entity195 literally means " good @entity195			0
" ) so you take			0
you take just enough for a couple of days and a couple of family members			0
you take and you run to feed those for whom the only measure of fortune is survival in @entity28 , post-earthquake			1
you take and you run			0
are you a looter ? try as we might to prevent it , the answer to that question is inevitably racialized			0
we can not separate the word looting from its racial implications or the supposed crime of looting from its racial origins			1
in the throes of the civil rights movement in the @entity27 , many states made looting a crime			0
almost all of these states were southern states that had a history of criminalizing behavior that they associated more with african - americans than with whites			0
even so , the criminal law , for all of its shortcomings , is often more sophisticated than we are			0
it recognizes that context matters			0
it has been developed with concepts -- such as necessity and justification -- to identify the circumstances under which a person who would normally be held culpable can be held either less culpable or not at all culpable			1
taking food is different than taking a television			1
it is past time for our news media to develop similar sophistication			1
it is time to stop characterizing black people trying to survive in dire circumstances as looters			1
are they takers ? yes			0
are they looters ? let 's wait for a criminal conviction first			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity258 .			1

@entity258 says calling some @entity28 quake victims looters advances a racial stereotype
he says even after @entity40 *criticism* , media are quick to buy into this characterization
he describes the desperate circumstances that might lead a victim to take food
@entity258 : reasons for taking matter , especially in a disaster
