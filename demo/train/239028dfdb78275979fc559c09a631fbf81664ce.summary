-- as the title character of @entity4 's solemnly transfixing " @entity3 , " @entity1 is tall and elegantly stooped , with thatchy gray - black hair , sunken cheeks , and a grin that tugs at the corners of his mouth whenever he tries to win someone over by telling them a good story ( which is often )			1
day - @entity1 looks so much like the photographs of @entity3 that you do n't have to squint , even a bit , to buy that it 's him			1
he nails @entity19 's thousand - yard stare — a gaze directed at once inward ( at the whir of his own mental machinery ) and outward ( at the cosmic hum of history )			1
day - @entity1 ' performance has a beautiful gravitas , yet there 's nothing too severe about it			1
he gives @entity3 a surprisingly plainspoken , reedy high voice that retains the courtly cadences of the @entity32			1
that voice — from everything we know , it 's quite accurate — makes @entity19 sound like @entity38 as a professor of human nature			1
this @entity3 lives deep inside his own unruly - haired head , yet he loves the people around him , even the ignorant ( and racist ) common folk , who repay the favor by loving him back			1
and that 's where he draws his political force			0
photos : ' @entity3 ' extras pose for portraits " @entity19 , " which @entity4 has directed from a lyrical , ingeniously structured screenplay by @entity53 , is one of the most authentic biographical dramas i 've ever seen			1
but that does n't mean it 's a stiff - jointed history lesson			2
the movie is grand and immersive			0
it plugs us into the final months of @entity3 's presidency with a purity that makes us feel transported as though by time machine			1
( @entity53 is the husband of @entity0 columnist @entity65			0
) most of the film unfolds in january 1865 , shortly after @entity3 's reelection , when he knows that the @entity69 is going to win the @entity70			1
the real battle for him now is the fight against slavery			0
three commissioners from the @entity75 head up to @entity76 , and @entity3 is confident that he could have their surrender within a week			2
but before that can happen , he is driven to pass the 13th amendment , which would outlaw slavery			0
the @entity81 hate the amendment , and even @entity3 's liberal @entity83 comrades want him to delay the vote			1
only @entity3 grasps the stakes : that once the @entity70 is over , the amendment wo n't pass — it will be blocked by the @entity32			1
winning the war could prove a pyrrhic victory			0
only by threading the amendment through the eye of a legislative needle can he alter the course of history			0
@entity19 features a great deal of incendiary speech - making on the floor of the @entity95 , and @entity53 's script , which is based in part on the @entity100 book @entity98 : the @entity101 of @entity3 , has a lot of fun weaving insults of astonishing brazenness into oratory that lays bare the issues in all their gripping moral complexity			1
@entity4 , denying himself visual fireworks , frames the action with a kind of stately tension			0
he thrillingly demythologizes @entity3 by placing us inside @entity3 's experience — shut up by himself ( or with his querulous cabinet ) in the drab meeting rooms of the @entity118 , or in his bedroom with the ambitious , haunted @entity120 ( @entity121 ) , who still blames @entity122 for the death of their son @entity124			1
field 's performance is shattering — in a few furious scenes , she redefines this first lady as a woman whose supposed madness reflected a humane fervor as sterling as her husband 's			2
as the congressional fight rages on , " @entity19 " orchestrates it all			2
he seduces , cajoles , begs , and tyrannizes			0
he offers patronage jobs — bribes — to the @entity81 congressmen who support slavery			0
he courts but also tamps down the influence of @entity143 ( @entity144 ) , the abolitionist who 's so possessed by the cause that he might alienate any congressman on the fence			0
and through it all , @entity3 must delay the war 's end — without breaking the people 's faith			2
the @entity19 we see here is that rare movie creature , a heroic thinker			2
he has the serpentine intellect of a master lawyer , infused with a poet 's passion			0
" @entity19 " brilliantly dramatizes the delicacy of politics , along with the raw brutality of it			1
all that 's pushing the amendment forward is @entity3 's will , his ability to do anything — even flirt with impeachable deceptions — to fulfill his vision of justice			2
and that 's why he spends the movie alone in spirit			0
when he bangs his hand on the table , roaring at his lobbyists to procure him the votes he needs because he 's '' clothed in immense power , '' we 're seeing the birth of the presidency as we know it — a force that can shape the consciousness of the world			0
@entity3 is a stirring paradox , a dream of history as it might truly have happened			2
