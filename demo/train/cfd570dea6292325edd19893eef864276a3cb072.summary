-- two weeks after @entity3 announced a new @entity4 , shoppers looking to snap one up for the holidays -- or just for themselves -- are no closer to knowing when the tablet might hit stores			1
there was no word tuesday on a release date for the updated version of @entity3 's tinier tablet , four days after its larger sibling , the new @entity12 , went on sale			1
when the two new tablets were unveiled last month , @entity3 ceo @entity14 said the new @entity16 , with a speedier processor and the same high - definition " retina display " as its bigger cousins , would be released " later in november			1
" speculation -- and when is even the most minor of @entity3 releases not preceded with flurries of speculation ? -- has begun to center on november 22 as a likely release date			1
@entity3 tends to release new products on fridays , giving them a full weekend to rack up sales while excitement is high			2
waiting a week later than the 22nd would have the @entity16 released on @entity30 , when it would face an avalanche of competition as virtually everyone in the electronics field will be offering post-thanksgiving sales			2
also , @entity36 is uncharacteristically early this year , beginning on november 27 , the same day as @entity37			0
to take full advantage of the holiday gift - buying season , @entity3 would want the new tablet on shelves before then			0
adding to the speculation , a product listing on @entity44 's website recently listed the release date for the @entity4 as november 21 , although that date appears to have since been removed			1
@entity3 did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment for this story			0
whenever the @entity4 arrives , supplies of the device may be limited at first			2
early reports said the tablet would be delayed because of a shortage of its new , high - definition display screens			1
more recently , it 's been reported that @entity3 has turned to rival @entity59 for help cranking out the screens in time for a holiday rollout			0
@entity64 's @entity63 ( @entity66 version ) reported that the @entity16 displays from the @entity69 tech company would n't be available until next year , though			0
@entity3 says the new @entity16 will come in two colors : silver or space gray			0
prices will range from $ 399 for a @entity75 - only , 16gb model to $ 829 for a @entity77 model with cellular connectivity .			0

no release date for the second - *generation* @entity4 has been announced
speculation has centered on november 22
the new @entity16 has a *faster* processor and high - definition screen
reports *suggest* *manufacturing* on the tablets has been slow
