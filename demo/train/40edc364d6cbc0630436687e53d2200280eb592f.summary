the @entity23 immigrant had been involuntarily admitted to @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity9 , on june 18 for what the hospital described as " agitation and psychosis			1
" the security video , released earlier this month by the @entity31 , showed that the mother of six waited in a chair for nearly 24 hours before she fell on the floor on june 19			1
an hour went by before a hospital employee nudged @entity37 , 49 , with her foot and summoned help			2
the @entity31 alleged that hospital records were falsified to show that @entity37 had been " sitting quietly in the waiting room " a little more than 10 minutes after she had stopped moving and 48 minutes after she slid to the floor			2
@entity37 's autopsy reveals that she died from pulmonary thromboemboli -- blood clots that formed in her legs and eventually made their way into her lungs , according to @entity52 , the medical examiner 's spokeswoman			1
the clots came from deep vein thrombosis , which complicated @entity37 's chronic paranoid schizophrenia			1

@entity37 's relatives say they plan to file a $ 25 million lawsuit against the city and the hospital and have called for criminal charges against hospital workers			1
@entity24 is already the subject of a lawsuit filed in may 2007 alleging that conditions at the facility are filthy			2
patients are often forced to sleep in plastic chairs or on floors covered in urine , feces and blood while waiting for beds , the groups allege , and often go without basic hygiene such as showers , clean linens and clean clothes			0
the lawsuit claims that patients who complain face physical abuse and are injected with drugs to keep them docile			0
the hospital lacks " the minimal requirements of basic cleanliness , space , privacy , and personal hygiene that are constitutionally guaranteed even to convicted felons , " according to the suit			0
the video of @entity37 's death sent the organizations back into court july 1 , demanding immediate reform			1
among the reforms agreed to in court by the hospital are additional staffing ; checking of patients every 15 minutes ; and limiting to 25 the number of patients in the psychiatric emergency ward , officials said			0
