" he 's even got an " @entity68 " personalized license plate			2
@entity0 spoke to @entity13 recently about his debut novel			1
the following is an edited transcript			2
@entity0 : what was the spark that led you to write " @entity14 " ? @entity13 : the initial idea for the story came to me way back in the summer of 2001			1
i was working a technical support job at the time , helping people use computers and the @entity81 , and so i spent a lot of time thinking about the future of the @entity81			0
i believed it might evolve into a sprawling virtual universe , sort of a cross between @entity88 and @entity89			0
when i start imagining what sort of person would create such a virtual world , i pictured a @entity94 video game designer holding a grand video game contest inside his virtual world , and the rest of the story grew out of that first idea			0
@entity0 : what was your introduction to geek culture growing up ? @entity13 : that 's hard to say			1
i feel like i was hit by all of geek culture at once while i was growing up in the ' 70s and ' 80s			1
saturday morning cartoons like " @entity110 " and " @entity111			0
" live action @entity113 shows like " @entity115 " and " @entity116			0
" i spent most of my childhood welded to my @entity118 , until i got my first computer , a @entity119			0
i grew up immersing myself in all of these things , and they informed my whole adolescence			0
@entity0 : you demonstrate an encyclopedia - like knowledge of ' 80s pop culture			0
it seems like a lifetime of research went into your novel			0
@entity13 : it did , in a way , because i was writing about everything i love			1
it took me a long time to write this novel , and i maintained my interest in the project by filling the story with things i 'm passionate about			0
i was also being lazy , in a way , since i did n't have to do a lot of new research			0
now , all of the geeking out i 've been doing my entire life can retroactively be classified as " research " for my novel			0
@entity0 : tell me about " @entity14 " the movie			2
i hear you 're writing the screenplay ? @entity13 : yes , i wrote the first draft of the screenplay adaptation earlier this year , and that 's what @entity153 is using to find the right director			1
they 're very excited about the reception the book is receiving , so the movie could go into production as early as next year			2
@entity0 : you also wrote the movie " @entity164			1
" how did that experience compare to writing your first novel ? @entity13 : it was a lot more frustrating , because i had to give up control of the story to get the movie made , and so the end product did n't turn out exactly the way i 'd hoped			1
that experience actually motivated me to finish " @entity14 , " because i wanted to see what would happen if i was able to have total control of my story , with no filters between me and the audience			0
@entity0 : tell me about your " @entity180			0
i understand you 're wrapping up a cross-country road trip ? @entity13 : well , i 've wanted to own a @entity183 since i was 10 years old , but it always seemed like a silly daydream			1
like owning the " a-team " van or something			0
but once i sold my novel , it occurred to me that i could finally buy a @entity183 and us it to promote the book , since the protagonist drives one in the story			0
i could pose with the car in my author photo , then drive it across the country on my book tour , thus making it a business expense ! it 's one of the best ideas i 've ever had			2
when i bought the car , i knew i wanted to trick it out like the @entity183 in the book , which combines elements from @entity208 's @entity207 , @entity209 from " @entity63 , " the " @entity210 - 1 , and " @entity65 's " @entity211			1
so i went on the @entity81 and found a @entity183 , an @entity212 , and a wide array of @entity215 equipment , including a screen - accurate @entity216 ( which rides shotgun )			0
then i installed a blue @entity209 scanner on the front of the car and got some personalized @entity222 license plates			0
then i took my time traveling , @entity223 , @entity224 out on the road			0
it was a big hit at every bookstore i stopped at on my tour			0
get a guided tour of @entity13 's tricked out 1982 @entity183			1
@entity0 : it seems like recently geek culture has gone mainstream			2
would you agree ? does that change anything about being a geek ? @entity13 : i have no choice but to agree			1
i wrote the geekiest novel in history and it 's now been on the @entity242 best - seller list for several weeks			1
from my perspective , it definitely seems that the geeks have inherited the @entity246			0
it 's changed my whole life			2
@entity0 : what are you geeking out to now ? @entity13 : @entity252 's new novel , " @entity253			1
" i managed to snag an advance copy and i ca n't put it down			0
mr. @entity252 is one of my favorite writers			0
@entity0 : what 's next for you ? @entity13 : well , i 've started working on an outline for a possible sequel to " @entity14			1
" but at the moment , i 'm working on a geeky coming - of - age movie set in the late ' 80s			2
sort of my version of " @entity266 , " but instead of sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll , my characters are steeped in @entity4 , arcade games and comic books			0
it 's going to be the nerdiest coming - of - age movie ever made			1
