@entity0 -- cyberattacks pose more of a threat to the @entity5 than a land - based attack by a terrorist group , while @entity9 's development of a nuclear weapons program poses a " serious threat , " the director of national intelligence told @entity12 on tuesday			1
the warning by director of national intelligence @entity14 came in his annual report to @entity12 on the threats facing the @entity5			1
" attacks , which might involve cyber and financial weapons , can be deniable and unattributable , " @entity14 said in prepared remarks before the @entity19			1
" @entity23 can be invisible , latent and progressive			0
" the @entity24 is increasingly being used as a tool both by nations and terror groups to achieve their objectives , according to @entity14 's report			1
however , there is only a " remote chance " of a major cyberattack on the @entity5 that would cause widespread disruptions , such as regional power outages , the report says			2
most countries or groups do n't have the capacity to pull it off			2
while @entity14 emphasized possible cyberthreats , committee members raised questions about the potential nuclear dangers posed by @entity9 and @entity44 , the increasing prevalence of @entity46 in @entity47 and the effect of cuts to the @entity5 budget on intelligence activities			1
president @entity53 cracks whip on cybercrime ' belligerent rhetoric ' angered by @entity57 sanctions over its nuclear test , @entity9 threatened for the first time to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the @entity5 and @entity61			1
even by @entity9 standards , the threat of a nuclear strike and the scrapping of a 1953 truce that effectively ended the @entity66 have been incredibly provocative , @entity14 said			1
" the rhetoric , while it is propaganda laced , is also an indicator of their attitude and perhaps their intent , " he said , adding he was concerned what , if any , provocative action @entity9 would take against its southern neighbor			1
sen. @entity76 , @entity77 , quizzed @entity14 about what , if any , deterrence , works with @entity9 and @entity44 , who have been slapped with numerous @entity57 sanctions over the development of a nuclear program			1
" @entity84 assured destruction ? are they responsive to that kind of rational thinking that has guided @entity5 policy for 50 years ? are these countries like the ( former ) @entity91 , that we can have some confidence that they 're gon na make a rational decision knowing that if they do something crazy they are going to be wiped out ? " @entity76 asked			0
@entity14 told the committee he believed that both @entity9 and @entity44 understand that			1
@entity9 , for whatever reason , believes the @entity5 would use a nuclear weapon against it , @entity14 said			1
" they certainly respect the capability for our military , " he said			0
" they 've gone to school on what we 've done starting with @entity110			0
i know that for a fact			0
so i think deterrence in this broadest context does work and does have impact on decision - making calculus of those these two countries			0
" opinion : have the courage to deal with cyber war @entity46 's influence in @entity47 @entity14 also warned the committee that @entity47 's chemical weapons program has the potential to inflict mass causalities			1
" it adds to our concern that the increasingly beleaguered regime , having found its escalation of violence through conventional means inadequate , might be prepared to use the chemical weapons against the @entity47 people , " he said			2
he said the obvious question is how long embattled @entity47 president @entity136 can hang on to power			0
@entity47 has been mired in a civil war for more than two years			0
" and our standard answer is his days are numbered			0
we just do n't know the number , " he told the committee			0
" i think our assessment is , he is very committed to hanging in there and sustaining control of the regime			0
" perhaps the bigger concern is the rising influence and strength of the @entity150 , an " @entity153 " offshoot , among the @entity47 rebels , he said			0
the potential of the core of @entity46 to " launch a coordinated , massive attack " against the @entity5 , according to @entity14 , has diminished , while the global jihadist movement is more decentralized and , therefore , more of a threat			1
" lone wolves , domestic extremists and jihadist - inspired groups remain determined to attack @entity163 interests as they 've done most recently in @entity164 and @entity165			2
" the threat assessment describes an environment where jihadist terrorists are increasingly decentralized , creating challenges for the prevention of attacks			2
@entity46 vs. jihadist groups many of these groups have gained a foothold in the @entity178 countries , where a spike in threats to @entity5 interests has been recorded , the threat assessment report said			1
" the dispersed and decentralized nature of the terrorist networks ( that are ) active in the region highlights that the threat to @entity5 and @entity163 interests overseas is more likely to be unpredictable , " it states			0
it cites the @entity189 , @entity164 , attack that killed four @entity5 , and an attack on an @entity165 oil field as examples of how splinter groups or individuals with jihadist sympathies can act , even without direction from higher in the terrorist chain , @entity14 told the committee			1
@entity44 : haven or prison for @entity46 ? ' @entity200 and cyberattacks ' for the first time , the emphasis of @entity14 's report was on cyberthreats , in the form of cyberattacks or cyberespionage			1
already , foreign intelligence and security services have " penetrated numerous computer networks " in the @entity5 belonging to the government and private sector alike , the report says			2
although classified networks have been targeted , the majority of these attacks have involved unclassified networks , it states			0
the @entity5 has enjoyed a technological edge over other nations , but advances in information technology and business practices are evening the playing field , according to the report			2
" this is almost certainly allowing our adversaries to close the technological gap between our respective militaries , slowly neutralizing one of our key advantages in the international arena , " it said			0
however , there is only a " remote chance " of a major cyberattack on the @entity236 that would cause widespread disruptions , such as regional power outages , the report says			2
most countries or groups do n't have the capacity to pull it off			2
the report names @entity243 and @entity244 as two of the most " advanced cyber actors , " but says they are unlikely to launch an attack			0
@entity53 administration takes on hackers stealing trade secrets @entity1 's @entity251 reported from @entity0 ; @entity252 and @entity253 reported and wrote from @entity254 .			0
