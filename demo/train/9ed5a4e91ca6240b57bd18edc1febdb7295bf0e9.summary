-- the airline tickets @entity2 buys for a family vacation to @entity4 are refundable with a change fee , but her online travel agent fails to tell her that the fee is about a quarter of the cost of the ticket			1
now that she has to cancel , will she lose thousands of dollars ? q : we recently bought five tickets for a family vacation in @entity4 through @entity14 , an online travel agency			1
a few months later , we found out our daughter would be starting a new job and could n't make the trip with us			0
so we phoned @entity14 to cancel our reservation			2
when we booked the tickets , a @entity14 representative told us the tickets were nonrefundable and that if we canceled and used our credit to rebook another flight , we would have to pay a penalty			1
but i was never told how much the penalty would be			2
@entity14 consulted with @entity28 , which agreed to a full refund of all five tickets , which had cost us $ 2,271 each			1
@entity14 then charged us $ 535 per ticket in cancellation fees			1
i asked the agency for a breakdown , and it said the fees represented $ 410 to @entity28 , $ 75 to the consolidator and $ 50 to @entity14			1
a @entity14 representative said that when you buy this type of fare and have to cancel , the penalty fees are enormous because the airlines want to recoup their lost revenue			1
we have accepted our responsibility in the cancellation , but think $ 535 per ticket is excessive			1
can you help ? -- @entity2 , @entity48 , @entity49 a : this could have turned out much worse			0
your airline could have pocketed all of your money , and you would have been out of luck			0
@entity14 sells what are known as " consolidator " fares that are often less expensive than the tickets you buy through a traditional travel agent or by booking directly			1
the reason ? it works through a ticket wholesaler that buys tickets in bulk at a big discount			2
then it marks up the ticket prices enough to make a profit while still undercutting other published fares			0
but that 's not all			0
consolidator tickets typically come with more restrictions than the garden - variety nonrefundable tickets sold by airlines			2
while some can be canceled and re-used for a future purchase after paying a change fee , others are completely nonrefundable and non-changeable			0
meaning that if you have second thoughts about your vacation , your ticket 's gone			0
i do n't understand why you would n't ask your online travel agent for details on the change fees -- particularly if your daughter is either contemplating a new job or looking for work			2
if there 's even a chance you 'll have to cancel your ticket , a consolidator fare is n't the way to go			0
you should have considered a ticket with more reasonable change fees ( although " reasonable " is relative -- @entity28 charged a $ 150 fee for international reservations at the time you bought your tickets , which is excessive to a lot of people )			1
i also think the @entity14 representative with whom you spoke should have warned you about the change fees before you bought the tickets			1
this might have also been avoided by booking the tickets online , where such terms would presumably be clearly disclosed , instead of calling @entity14			1
i 've seen more than my share of confusing booking screens where important details are buried three screens under a hundred offers to rent a car or reserve a hotel room			0
i would n't have phoned the online agency after being asked to pay these cancellation fees			0
instead , a quick e-mail to feedback@cheapoair.com may have yielded better results			0
trust me on this : do n't call -- e-mail			0
i agree that $ 535 in cancellation charges is a little rich , so i contacted @entity14 on your behalf			1
i heard back from @entity128 , the company 's senior vice president of operations , who verified that this was a consolidator fare and that the fees were in line with what the company charges			2
still , @entity14 asked its consolidator to waive the fees on your behalf			2
you 've received a full refund -- a total of $ 11,355 -- from @entity14			1
