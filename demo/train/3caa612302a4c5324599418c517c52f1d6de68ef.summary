modern - day peeping @entity6 in @entity7 , the sorts who get their thrills snapping " upskirt " photos on crowded subways , now have their behavior criminalized			1
gov. @entity9 signed a bill friday , according to his office , making photographing or recording video under a person 's clothing -- think down a blouse or up a skirt -- a misdemeanor			2
" the legislation makes the secret photographing , videotaping , or electronically surveiling of another person 's sexual or other intimate parts , whether under or around a person 's clothing or when a reasonable person would believe that the person 's intimate parts would not be visible to the public , a crime , " @entity9 's office said in a prepared statement			0
the crime is punishable by up 2½ years in jail or a fine of up to $ 5,000			0
in addition , the law states that " whoever videotapes or photographs , with the intent to secretly conduct or hide such activity , the sexual or other intimate parts of a child " faces a sentence of 2½ to 5 years and up to a $ 5,000 fine			1
the law goes into effect immediately			1
victim of " upskirting " speaks out lawmakers hastily drew up and passed the bill thursday , a day after the state 's highest court ruled that current laws against secretly photographing a person in a state of partial nudity do n't apply to these sorts of secretive shots			1
" a female passenger on a @entity63 ( @entity63 ) trolley who is wearing a skirt , dress , or the like covering these parts of her body is not a person who is ' partially nude , ' no matter what is or is not underneath the skirt by way of underwear or other clothing , " wrote justice @entity58 of the state @entity59			0
the ruling stemmed from a case against @entity76 , 32 , who was arrested in 2010			1
he was accused of using his cell phone to take pictures and record video up the skirts and dresses of women riding on the trolley , court documents say			1
complaints were filed with transit police , who then staged " a decoy operation " to catch @entity76			0
he promptly pointed his phone up the dress of a female officer , court documents say			1
he was arrested and charged with two counts of attempting to secretly photograph a person in a state of partial nudity			0
though a lower court ruled against him , @entity76 found his case dismissed wednesday -- and outraged lawmakers got to work			2
" we are sending a message that to take a photo or video of a woman under her clothing is morally reprehensible and , in @entity7 , we will put you in jail for doing it , " state senate president @entity101 said in a prepared statement			1
" we will need to revisit this law again and again as technology continues to evolve and ensure that we are providing the necessary protections			2
" recognizing how technology plays a part in amplifying the violation is key , victim advocates say			0
the images can , in no time , make the international rounds online			0
" i think there 's a fear among people that you could have an ' upskirt ' photo taken of you and never realize it , " said @entity121 , executive director of @entity122 , a website that encourages women to share their stories and cell phone photos of harassers			2
" your crotch could be on the @entity135 , and you may never know about it			0
" states -- and victims -- grapple with ' upskirt ' laws against voyeurism			0
