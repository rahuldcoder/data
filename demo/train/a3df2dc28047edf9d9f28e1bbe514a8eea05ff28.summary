-- it 's time to pay up , @entity2			1
the era of free news is rapidly coming to a close			1
the @entity6 , one of the last holdouts among major newspapers , will probably begin charging for online access next year			1
and the @entity11 and @entity12 announced monday that they will launch separate paywall sites early next year			0
we 're all spoiled by the illusion that we can get whatever we want on the interwebs without having to pay a dime			1
fire up the @entity18 , troll the @entity19 , see who 's got the most tantalizing links			1
we all do it , and we all take it for granted			0
but you ca n't have a media ecosystem in which everyone is aggregating , summarizing and retweeting content from everyone else			0
at some point there have to be actual human beings making phone calls and attending events and pawing through public documents			0
watch : no more free lunch -- time to pay for news , @entity2 and these people -- known as " reporters " -- need to put food on the table			1
newspapers and magazines are partially to blame for this state of affairs			0
for many years they gave away their wares to anyone with a modem , anxious to avoid being left out of the burgeoning world of online commerce			1
readers thought nothing of subscribing to a paper that landed on their doorstep but balked at paying for news on their computer screens and mobile phones			2
the result , as we all know , has been widespread carnage in @entity2 newsrooms			0
some papers , such as the @entity64 and @entity65 , have folded			0
others , such as the @entity67 , have cut back to three times a week			0
the @entity69 just announced it is slashing a third of its newsroom			0
even the @entity72 , which has made fewer cuts than most papers , said last week that 30 jobs will be lost to buyouts			2
watch : @entity77 benched : when gasbags get it wrong there were several rounds of buyouts when i worked at the @entity6 , where the newsroom has shrunk significantly and the new editor , @entity85 , warns that more cuts are in store			1
in an overdue move , the paper now says it will likely move to a metered paywall , charging readers after they get a certain number of free articles each month			2
the @entity72 was among the pioneers of this movement in march 2011 and now has nearly 600,000 digital subscribers			2
it also helps to have an affluent expense - account crowd , which is why @entity100 's pay site has always thrived			1
the @entity6 has a unique problem in that it is a national brand online , but a local newspaper in terms of circulation			1
so the out - of - towners who might want to read political analysis by @entity109 and @entity110 do n't have the option of subscribing to the ink - on - paper version			0
yet the lucrative print ads that reach consumers in @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 are worth far more than the modest rates that can be charged for digital ads. so the paper badly needs another source of revenue			1
watch : did @entity123 go too far in pushing gun control ? the @entity125 , where i work , is also considering a metered paywall , now that the parent company is folding the print edition of @entity130 , which led to substantial layoffs last week			2
of course , readers have no august responsibility to pay for anything			2
and @entity135 got too fat and happy in the days of easy money			0
the @entity18 era is all about disaggregation -- that is , you can search for only the information you want about @entity142 or @entity143 or @entity144 without the packaging of a publication			2
you can get your fix from @entity150 friends			0
with new apps you can be your own editor , selecting the stories that suit your needs			0
so this is not a plea for charitable support			0
increasingly , the name of the game online is providing something that is so unique or compelling that readers feel it 's worth reaching for their credit card			1
but it is a reminder that we are hollowing out the business of newsgathering			2
this is a particular problem at the local level , where no one else is going to investigate decaying schools or the mayor steering contracts to his cronies			0
sadly , the shriveled staffs of many local papers are less able to do this kind of distinctive reporting , and will have a hard time persuading readers to pay for meager coverage with an overlay of local sports			1
it 's also true that there is less original reporting nationally on the environment , health care , criminal justice , finance and other vital areas			2
the @entity6 , where i was once @entity191 bureau chief , has shut down its bureaus around the country			1
the slow stampede toward paywalls will prompt a shakeout in which some publications survive by proving their worth and others head for the graveyard			0
some early signs are discouraging : @entity204 's @entity203 magazine @entity202 , which never had a clear identity , folded last week , and @entity207 's hugely successful site could n't get people to pay a modest fee for a monthly digital magazine			1
hey , if folks do n't think a paper or magazine or online venture is worth the weekly equivalent of a frappuccino , that 's their choice			1
but man does not live by buzz alone			0
in the end , we get the journalism we deserve			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .			1

@entity225 : @entity6 , other news outlets , may soon charge for online access
he says news organizations erred in giving news away free for so long to keep up
he says @entity6 needs revenue but digital ads *don* ' t bring as much as those from print circulation
@entity225 : news organizations ' cuts have *diminished* newsgathering -- it 's time to pay for journalism
