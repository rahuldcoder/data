@entity0 , @entity1 -- perhaps the most nervous people ahead of wednesday night 's world premiere of @entity6 's " @entity5 " in @entity0 will be the weather forecasters			1
as the wind whipped through @entity1 's capital city with customary spring ferocity , they would have been praying for more lenient treatment than the average @entity13 seismologist if their forecast for fine weather on the big day turns out to be wrong			1
@entity0 is stunning on a beautiful day , but only the brave plan outdoor events , and the red carpet parade of @entity5 stars and crew through the city before the premiere is both a genuine moment of national celebration and a chance to impress the visitors			2
international media are here in droves , almost never seen in this far - flung place which , while sometimes dubbed @entity31 , is really at the end of the @entity31			0
arriving by air , they will already have seen the rather amusing @entity36 safety briefing video in which @entity37 turn off bony @entity38 , and @entity39 push luggage under the seat with their furry feet			1
they may have even flown in on the @entity44 decked out in @entity5 livery			2
at @entity0 airport , they 'll have seen the staff wearing jokey " @entity50 " vests , and a giant @entity51 poised disconcertingly over the snack bars			0
what they wo n't have seen as they landed at the hair - raising local aerodrome , set close among suburban houses , is a sign saying " @entity60			0
" watch : sneak preview of @entity5 too many locals thought that idea was just a bit too craven , notwithstanding the fact that @entity6 's stunning success has pumped millions of dollars and a great lump of creative industries into an otherwise remote , government town			1
a string of productions including the " @entity72 " trilogy , " @entity74 , " " @entity75 , " " @entity76 , " and " @entity77 " have built a globally credible film facility in what used to be a quiet corner of town best known for its garden center and some second - hand shops			1
people down here are a bit like @entity89 's dwarves , you see ; fine when you get to know them , but with noses easily put out of joint			0
when " @entity76 " director @entity93 bought a spread over the hill from @entity0 , as many complained about farmland sales to foreigners as thought it might be good for the place			0
@entity6 himself is known to entertain occasional despair at the small - mindedness of his countryfolk			2
he remains loyal to the industry he 's built here but he 's also had to be ruthless about it			0
a campaign orchestrated by @entity110 trade unions saw @entity111 threaten to take the project to @entity113 rather than agree to bind @entity1 actors and crew into the kinds of contracts they 're fleeing the @entity119 to avoid			2
stars , fans turn out for ' @entity5 ' premiere in the process , the @entity1 prime minister , @entity123 , earned a reputation as a huge suck - up to @entity111 , and political opponents wondered just how much principle was for sale to get a movie made here			1
echoes of that bitter campaign have re-emerged to spoil the film 's global publicity			0
there have been late - surfacing claims , hotly denied , of animal cruelty on set and ham - fisted handling by local media seeking to tell more than the fairy story			0
the @entity5 has also been used as a political weapon in local political sparring over the country 's economic direction			2
if it 's really so pure , the critics fairly ask , how come @entity1 's environmental halo has slipped so badly of late ? local media breathlessly pick apart reports on the issue from the @entity151 with all the parochial angst you 'd expect from a place unused to attracting attention and desperate to be well - regarded			1
still , no one ever said a @entity89 plot was subtle			0
meanwhile , in a country where manufacturers and farmers have expected neither tax breaks nor protective tariffs for a generation , @entity1 seem as placid as @entity165 burghers about nearly half a billion @entity166 dollars in tax breaks that have secured every production since the @entity72			1
perhaps with his next trilogy in mind , @entity6 was this week warning there would need to be more where that came from if @entity1 is to compete with the many other countries that know blockbuster movies do more for national self - belief than a million widgets ever will			1
still , the gods appear to be smiling on the enterprise			0
how else to explain the eruption on cue of the volcano that plays @entity184 -- a central landscape for @entity5 shenanigans -- mere days before the premiere ? given the @entity5 - mania gripping the country , it 's just a wonder that when authorities closed the area to tourists , they did n't put signs saying : " @entity196			1

@entity1 's capital to host the premiere of @entity6 's *adaptation* of " @entity5 "
even @entity36 has gotten into the *spirit* , with a @entity5 - *inspired* " elf n safety " video
other @entity110 blockbusters filmed there include " @entity72 " trilogy , " @entity74 "
@entity6 has warned that the country will have to do more to attract future big productions
