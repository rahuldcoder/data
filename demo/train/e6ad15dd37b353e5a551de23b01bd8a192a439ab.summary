@entity0 , @entity1 -- if college athletes were to start being paid , many schools would leave @entity8 sports , @entity4 president @entity3 said thursday			1
and the universities that stayed in @entity8 sports would have to start cutting other , less popular sports to be able to afford the salaries			0
there would be less competition and no more national championship games — at least not in their current form , @entity3 said			2
@entity3 testified at the landmark federal trial for former @entity20 player @entity19 's lawsuit against the @entity4			1
he and other athletes are suing for the opportunity for future athletes to be paid for the use of their names , images and likenesses when they play sports on television			1
@entity3 said he believes the customs that most college sports fans hold most dear -- the camaraderie of game day , the tailgating , the atmosphere of a stadium packed with nearly 100,000 fans and the pride of cheering for a university team -- are at stake			1
" traditions and keeping them are very important to universities , " @entity3 said			2
" these individuals are not professionals			0
they are representing their universities as part of a university community			0
" people come to watch ... because it 's college sports , with college athletes , " he said			1
those beloved traditions go hand in hand with the model of amateurism , and if amateurism goes away , so will the games as we know them now , he said			0
many schools lose money on @entity8 athletics but keep them for the " social cohesion " and the boost to their profiles , @entity3 said			2
@entity3 said officials at several member schools have told him that if athletes were to start getting paid beyond the cost of attendance , institutions would ditch @entity8 sports and opt for @entity76 or iii , in which coach 's salaries , stadiums , hype and scholarships are much smaller			1
" do the members want the sports to remain amateur ? " an @entity4 lawyer asked			2
" yes , " @entity3 replied			0
" if the rules were changed to permit student athletes to be paid for ( names , images and likenesses ) , would that change what college sports is all about ? " yes , it would			1
" never before has the @entity4 membership — leaders at about 1,100 colleges and universities — proposed changing the rules to allow college athletes to be paid			1
however , they are currently considering giving athletes a bit more " miscellaneous " money to cover the full cost of attending college			0
@entity3 , a much - anticipated witness at the three - week trial , testified for five hours thursday and is expected to continue on friday			2
on the stand , @entity3 embodied the @entity4 's no - budge , no - compromise take on the issue of pay - for - play , citing the organization 's century - old history			1
in the five years since the @entity19 suit was first filed , there have been several controversies and many attempts to reform the @entity4			1
@entity3 acknowledged that public opinion of the organization is low and that part of his directive when he took this job was to fix that			0
while he made no concessions to the argument of hypocrisy in college sports — the idea that everyone else involved makes money , except the athletes — @entity3 did concede that the commercialization of college sports is overwhelming the amateurism			1
he said the use of athletes ' names , images and likenesses is " one of the most debated topics in @entity4 history			1
" one of @entity19 's lawyers , @entity143 , displayed picture after picture of athletes with corporate logos and asked , " putting athletes in front of logos , that 's all fine under @entity4 rules ? " " it 's not something i 'm personally comfortable with , " @entity3 responded			1
" ... it 's certainly not where i would prefer the rules be drawn			0
" responding to questions from @entity157 district judge @entity156 about commercial exploitation , @entity3 said the schools have chosen to define it to mean that college athletes should not be acting as " pitchmen " for products			1
a recent poll conducted by the @entity165 showed that 66 % of @entity157 do n't think athletes should be paid beyond scholarship money			0
but complicating the issue are recent academic scandals and consistent court testimony from athletes from several different schools that they were athletes first , not students			0
@entity3 responded by saying that it 's hard to get motivated athletes to focus more on schoolwork , but he insisted that they are motivated to play college sports because of the education they receive			1
but when he was asked about that education , he first mentioned the life experience that athletes earn on the field , then discussed what they learn in class			0
@entity19 's lawyers questioned @entity3 at length about an e-mail sent to him at the start of his presidency by a senior member of the organization , @entity193			1
it said " the notion that athletes are students is the great hypocrisy of intercollegiate athletics " and said the public believes the athletes are exploited in the name of money for higher - caliber coaches and bigger stadiums			0
last week , @entity19 's lawyers said that even if @entity156 were to rule in their favor , the conferences and colleges could still decide on their own not to share any of the television revenues with athletes			2
as long as the @entity4 does n't have a rule against it , it would still be ok for colleges to choose not to pay			0
rules , @entity3 testified , are necessary			2
" it 's essential there be a body that provides rule - making , " he said			0
" one of the most fundamental principles of fair competition is that everyone is playing by the same rules			0
everyone understands they are governing and conducting the game the same way from one side of the country to another			0
you could n't do it nationally without those rules			0
" as testimony starts in former college star 's suit , @entity4 settles another suit @entity4 faces change , legal challenges in months ahead			2

@entity4 president @entity3 said paying athletes would hurt traditions
national championships , camaraderie as we know them would end , he testified
" people come to watch ... because it 's college sports , " he said in federal court
