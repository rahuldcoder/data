-- climate scientists are getting desperate			1
after years of enduring politically motivated attacks , they are still scrambling to defend their findings			1
in a letter last month to @entity6 , 255 of the nation 's most prominent scientists -- all members of the @entity10 , including 11 @entity12 laureates -- repeat conclusions that by now should be entirely familiar , even tedious , to anyone who has followed the science at all			1
our planet is warming because of increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere			2
burning fossil fuels and deforestation have caused most of the increase			0
climate change is a threat to coastal communities , food and water supplies , and ecosystems			2
and contrary to some recent claims , it is not too late to do something about it			0
the scientists conclude , in obvious exasperation , that one " snowy winter in @entity36 does not alter " these basic facts			2
the immediate trigger for the letter @entity42 state attorney general @entity41 's recent demand that climate scientist @entity43 , director of the @entity44 at @entity45 , produce a large volume of paperwork related to his scientific research and communications with fellow scientists during his years at @entity51 from 1999 to 2005			1
" @entity56 " is how the scientists characterize @entity41 's action , filed under the state 's @entity54			2
many have dismissed @entity41 as silly , particularly in light of his efforts to impose @entity61 modesty on the state seal of @entity42 , and his actions could be shrugged off if they were isolated			0
but they are the latest example of a persistent , and worrisome , trend : attacking scientists who have done key work that demonstrates the human impact on climate			1
@entity43 is the principal author of the " hockey stick curve " -- a graph that boldly illustrates the dramatic rise in average global temperatures over the past 50 years , a rise unlike anything in the previous 1,000 years			2
because the hockey stick curve is visually compelling , it 's been reproduced many times , and in 2001 the @entity78 featured it in their third assessment report			0
it 's also made @entity43 a target for those who do n't want to admit that global warming is a real problem			1
@entity43 testified about his work in the @entity87 in 2003 , in hearings sponsored by sen. @entity89 of @entity90 , who has called global warming a " hoax			1
" two years later , @entity93 rep. @entity92 demanded that @entity43 supply copious documentation related to his testimony , based on what @entity92 , who has no scientific training , alleged were " methodological flaws and data errors " in his work			2
@entity102 , the lead author of the @entity6 letter , was threatened with a lawsuit by contrarian @entity105 in 2003			2
@entity105 has long denied the scientific evidence of human - caused warming , and @entity102 said those views flew in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence and likened them to believing in a flat @entity112			1
in 1995 , a group called @entity114 , composed of the @entity115 and a host of fossil - fuel dependent corporations , attacked @entity119 , a scientist at the @entity120 who had done key work demonstrating the human " fingerprint " on climate			1
without any substantive evidence , the group accused @entity119 of committing " scientific cleansing " of the @entity78 's @entity130 by removing mention of uncertainties to make global warming appear more certain than it was			1
a handful of physicists attached to another think - tank , the @entity134 , splashed the accusation onto the pages of the @entity137 , ensuring millions of @entity138 saw them			2
@entity119 was later vindicated -- all the co-authors testified he had made no unauthorized changes			0
yet the impression of wrong - doing remained			0
perhaps no scientific name is more associated with global warming than @entity145 , mentor to @entity146 , who first warned of the risks of human - caused climate change in the 1950s			1
in 1992 , a paper was released that claimed @entity145 had changed his mind about global warming and no longer believed it was a problem			1
the claim was repeated many times in the mass media , including @entity156 and the @entity157			0
@entity145 was elderly and seriously ill at the time , and died before he had a chance to respond			0
his graduate student , @entity159 , tried to set the record straight by publicly disputing the claim			0
he was soon sued by the author of the claim , and lacking funds to defend himself , was forced to settle out of court , leaving his personal and professional life in tatters			0
but it is n't just climate scientists who have been vilified , personally attacked , and threatened with lawsuits and congressional investigations			1
since the early 1990s , there has been a sustained history of attempts to undermine any science that suggested that contemporary industrial society might be doing irreparable harm to human health and the natural environment			2
this included the science that demonstrated the harms of @entity183 , the dangers to children of second - hand smoke , the causes of acid rain , and the reality of the ozone hole			1
often the same people were involved in several or even all of these attacks			0
the common feature in all these cases was a link to think tanks promoting free markets and opposing government regulations			1
one does n't have to be a conspiracy theorist to see the pattern : people are loath to admit that our free market system has created problems that the free market has proved ineffectual to solve			0
@entity207 , former chief economist at the @entity208 , has called global warming " the greatest and widest - ranging market failure ever seen			1
" deaths from tobacco smoking , environmental destruction from @entity183 and other pesticides , acid rain and the ozone hole were market failures , too			1
insufficiently regulated market capitalism created these problems , and it took government interventions -- and in some cases , international agreements -- to fix them			0
if you tried to argue that global warming is not a market failure , you 'd just look silly			1
so extremist defenders of the free market have found themselves an easier target			0
science is arcane and scientists are frankly often incomprehensible			2
but the important point for us to understand is this : scientists have done nothing wrong			0
on the contrary , they 've been repeatedly vindicated in their work on environmental change			0
the real crime is not to be found in some pile of obscure scientific documents or the e-mails of harassed scientists			0
the real crime is that our best science is being undermined by ideologues , confusing us about some of the most important issues of our time			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors .			0

@entity255 , @entity254 : 255 scientists wrote letter to reiterate global warming findings
authors : letter came after attack on scientist whose work shows human impact on climate
they say attacks similar to those aimed at science on @entity183 , second - hand smoke , acid rain
common to all , they say , is link to think tanks promoting free markets , opposing regulations
