" his skinny stature is yet another contrast to @entity1 , who 's of beefy build			1

at the same time , @entity12 would decentralize and reform government and make public service delivery more efficient			2

@entity12 would continue @entity1 's social agenda -- but with more results , @entity112 said			1
government hiring would be based on expertise , not political loyalties , for example			0

that plant suffered mismanagement , delays in major maintenance and underinvestment , according to analysts and an engineering firm 's recent report			0
the state - run oil company that operates the refinery was found to have been hampered by how @entity1 uses the refineries as " a cash cow " to fund social programs such as building homes for low - income voters , the report said			1
the fires at the @entity203 refinery also were described as " the most lethal industry accident in @entity2 to date " by analysts			2
