voters in the @entity1 lined up at polling stations monday as the giant country holds its second postwar election despite opposition calls for delay over logistical challenges			1
the presidential and parliamentary polls are critical in the @entity11 nation struggling to rebuild years after a conflict left millions dead and displaced entire regions			1
incumbent @entity14 , who took over after his father died in 2001 and was elected in @entity1 's first democratic election five years later , is one of 11 presidential contenders			1
more than 18,000 candidates are vying for 500 parliamentary seats , according to election officials			2
" @entity14 's regime has lasted too long			1
it 's the same system , they are doing the same thing			2
looting this country , " said @entity25 , who lives in the capital of @entity27			0
@entity1 election could be a test of country 's democracy " this is our version of the @entity36 uprising ... we want him ( the incumbent ) out			1
this country is rich in resources , but we have turned into world spectators			0
this frustration has lasted too long			1
" @entity25 , a 42 - year - old consultant , said he is supporting the leading opposition candidate , @entity43			0
" people felt cheated by the system , " he said			0
" @entity14 has not lived up to the expectations			1
we are ready to take to the streets if our candidate does not win			0
" @entity14 loyalists , in turn , accused the opposition of inciting violence and said there are fears of protests if he does not secure a victory			1
" as soon as i cast my vote , i 'm going home and locking my doors , " said @entity58 , who also lives in the capital			0
" i do n't know what will happen after the election , i am afraid			0
" supporters of both frontrunners have clashed repeatedly as the nation prepared for election day			1
its last election in 2006 was overseen by the @entity72 and considered a transition from decades of dictatorship , making this year 's vote the first true test of democracy , analysts say			1
tensions are very high , " said @entity79 , the @entity1 representative of @entity80 , a nonpartisan group that raises awareness of the election			1
" the opposition wants to win , it 's now or never			0
@entity43 is already considering himself president , we do n't know how all sides will react if their candidates do n't win			0
" clashes have erupted in days leading up to the vote , with at least two deaths reported when supporters of the two frontrunners hurled rocks at one another saturday , @entity91 said			0
days before the poll , dozens of helicopters airlifted balloting materials over the @entity11 nation as the last - minute activities sparked concerns of vote irregularities			1
the massive nation has poor infrastructure and long stretches or dirt roads that make it impossible to deliver ballot material to some regions , especially during the rainy season			1
in addition to the logistical nightmare , fraud allegations started before the vote and the opposition alleges that the leader of the electoral commission was picked by the incumbent , according to @entity121 , a spokesman for @entity43			0
@entity1 is not ready to conduct elections yet , @entity121 said			1
" no country is perfect , but we should be able to conduct organized elections			0
we should respect the rights of the @entity1 to have good elections , and our country does not have the facilities -- even roads -- to do that , " he said			2
for months , @entity43 's party demanded a change in the date because the government does not have adequate resources to meet the election needs			2
" we wrote to the election commission in april and told them the calendar was unrealistic			0
we could not see how they could manage to achieve that			0
this election will not be fair , " @entity121 said			0
analysts fear post-election violence could further destabilize the nation , which is battling unrest years after the 1998 - 2003 conflict that left 5 million dead as a result of fighting , diseases and starvation			1
stability in @entity1 -- which borders nine countries -- is vital to @entity156 's @entity155			1
the years of war affected at least six neighboring nations , some of which are still battling rebel movements spawned during the conflict			1
despite @entity1 's vast resources including cobalt , gold , copper and tantalum , the fledgling democracy is mired in poverty and conflict especially in its eastern region , prompting complex economic and political relations with its neighbors and the world			1
a major international concern is the eastern region , a hot spot for the so - called " conflict minerals , " which led the @entity180 to intervene after human rights groups said the resources are used to fund wars in the nation and neighboring countries			2
last year , @entity180 lawmakers passed legislation that requires @entity180 electronics companies to submit annual reports outlining what they are doing to ensure minerals bought from @entity1 are " conflict - free			1
" it targets manufacturers using minerals from the east , where government forces have been battling rebels for years			2
" funding for armed groups often comes from the sale of minerals -- often to @entity180 companies -- from mines the groups control , " rep. @entity197 , a @entity198 from @entity199 , said last year			0
" this legislation will help save thousands of lives and help protect countless women in the @entity1 by cutting off a key source of funding for armed groups			2
" @entity1 has witnessed one of the worst humanitarian crises since @entity213 while the war ended eight years ago , women are paying a high price for the conflict in the east			1
violence and rapes are widely reported in the region , including a holiday season mass rape last year that left the international community reeling in disbelief			0
while @entity1 is among the nations with the largest @entity72 peacekeepers , the forces have been ineffective in stopping rapes in the sprawling , remote region			1
despite its shortcomings , the @entity230 says @entity1 has made some steps			2
in a january report called " @entity235 , " the international body showcased some progress , including a decline in maternal deaths and a spike in the number of children going to primary schools			0
however , despite the modest progress , less than a quarter of the population has access to clean water and only one in 10 people get electricity , according to the report			0
@entity14 faces a tough battle from foes hoping to persuade voters that change is overdue			2
@entity43 has said a majority of the nation 's about 70 million population lives in poverty despite ample resources , and has vowed to make reforms and sweeping changes if elected			2
" it 's time for change , time for security and justice , time for jobs and proper healthcare , time to educate our youth , " he said			0
@entity14 's former aide , @entity269 , who was instrumental in his 2006 win , is also among the contenders in the election			1
kamerhe , a former speaker in the @entity274 , broke with the president 's party a few years later			2
more than 30 million people are registered to vote , according to election officials			0
results are scheduled to be announced on december 6 .			0
