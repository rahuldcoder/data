-- with baseball season in full swing , here 's a list of some of the more creative , generous or ludicrous perks players have received			1
@entity8 finally gets paid hey , @entity10 fans , think things could n't get any worse ? next year former outfielder @entity8 goes back on the payroll at the ripe old age of 48			2
in 1999 , @entity8 returned to the @entity10 for a second stint at @entity15 following his borderline disastrous free - agent signing in 1992			1
@entity8 was n't any better the second time around , so the @entity10 waived him in 2000			2
the problem was that the team still owed @entity8 $ 5.9 million in guaranteed salary			2
@entity8 's agents worked out a deal with the @entity10 where he would defer the salary if the team would pay him $ 1,193,248.20 every july 1 from 2011 to 2035			2
not a bad deal for someone who was so bad the team basically paid him to go away			0
support for @entity25 ' ' stache former a 's owner @entity26 never thought of a gimmick he would n't try , including a mechanical rabbit that delivered fresh balls to the umpire and hiring a 13 - year - old @entity32 as his " @entity33 " in 1972 , @entity26 offered his players cash for growing a mustache by @entity36 , thereby giving birth to reliever @entity25 ' trademark handlebar ' stache			1
the @entity39 's went on to win the @entity40 that season , and @entity43 ' contract for 1973 contained a $ 300 bonus for growing the mustache as well as $ 100 for the purchase of mustache wax			1
@entity49 's tasty bonus after a spectacular rookie season in 1986 , rotund reliever @entity49 , who always pitched in his lucky @entity51 t - shirt , needed a new contract			1
@entity49 asked for $ 110,037.37 , matching his no. 37 jersey , to pitch in 1987			2
on top of that , he received 37 boxes of orange @entity58 in the deal			0
the @entity60 would soon regret this delicious bonus , though ; @entity49 , who was famously caught eating ribs in the dugout that season , would battle weight and injury problems and get sent down to the minors			2
@entity0 : 19 unusual injuries 4			0
@entity69 buy @entity71 insurance the @entity69 made a big free - agent splash this winter by signing starting pitcher @entity71 to a five - year , $ 82.5 million deal			1
signing pitchers to long - term contracts is a tricky venture due to the possibility of injury , but the @entity69 managed to give themselves a little peace of mind			1
if @entity71 misses any significant time due to surgery on a pre-existing elbow injury during the first five years of the contract , the @entity69 gain a club option for the 2015 season in which @entity71 would have to pitch for the major league minimum salary			0
@entity89 becomes a landlord the contract extension @entity89 signed with the @entity92 in 1984 must have been one of the stranger deals in @entity96 history			1
the club agreed to give @entity89 the bat he used in the infamous 1983 " @entity99 " as part of the pact , but that was n't the only odd perk			2
the contract also gave him part ownership of an apartment complex in @entity107			2
at the time , @entity108 co-owned the @entity92			1
@entity108 had made his fortune as a lawyer and real estate baron in @entity107 , so when the team needed a little extra incentive to get @entity89 to sign , they offered the third baseman a piece of one of @entity108 's developments			0
@entity89 's agent / brother @entity8 negotiated the deal ; he referred to the 1,100 - apartment complex as " a nice little kicker			1
" @entity89 received a guaranteed cash flow of $ 1 million from the development and retained the right to sell his 10 percent stake to the @entity92 for $ 2 million			1
@entity108 's @entity92 used the trick a couple more times when they signed reliever @entity130 and outfielder @entity131 to similar deals that gave them stakes in the 700 - apartment @entity136 development in @entity138			1
( @entity139 got 24.5 percent of the development , while @entity131 got 9.5 percent			0
) @entity108 later told the @entity140 that he might have given up too much in the hastily negotiated deals			0
@entity142 gets a legal deal all player contracts are full of legal jargon , but @entity142 ' 2007 deal with the @entity147 contained a different kind of legalese			2
in the wake of @entity142 ' ongoing problems with the law , the club negotiated a deal that would allow the @entity147 to release @entity142 or convert his contract to a non-guaranteed deal if he came under indictment for a crime			0
moreover , the club contractually severed its relationship with @entity142 ' personal trainers and wrote in the deal that said trainers were no longer allowed in team facilities			0
@entity166 's big toy before pitcher @entity166 made a start in the 2005 @entity169 , @entity60 owner @entity167 promised to make the ace 's dreams come true if he won , specifically his life goal of bulldozer ownership			2
after @entity166 dominated the @entity174 to send @entity60 to its first @entity40 , @entity167 came through with a @entity175			0
since @entity96 requires high - dollar gifts be disclosed , @entity166 signed an addendum to his contract , a " bulldozer clause , " authorizing the club to give him his new toy			1
@entity183 's lucky number @entity183 's deal with the @entity69 includes a plethora of strange or excessive clauses including housing allowances and a personal masseuse , but the oddest is that he 's contractually guaranteed the jersey number 18			0
@entity191 wo n't be homeless one would think a guy making a guaranteed $ 17 million a year would n't be too worried about keeping a roof over his head			1
the @entity197 star outfielder signed a five - year contract extension in july 2007 that included , among other perks , four round - trip airline tickets to @entity201 each year and the services of an interpreter and trainer throughout the season			1
it also included a housing allowance for each year of the deal			0
while the numbers themselves are n't eye - popping -- the allowance ranges from $ 32,000 to $ 36,000 a year over the life of the deal -- kudos to @entity191 for getting someone else to pay his rent			1
@entity0 : where are kids from @entity221 covers ? 10			0
@entity222 stays skinny by the end of his storied career , outspoken hurler @entity222 had started to get a bit doughy			1
when the @entity69 re-signed him to a one - year deal for $ 8 million before the 2008 season , it included a clause in which @entity222 could pick up an extra $ 2 million if he made weight at six random weigh - ins over the course of the season			1
@entity222 picked up a $ 333,333 check each time he did n't tip the scales too far			1
@entity237 's tennis ball launcher @entity10 outfielder @entity237 's mammoth seven - year , $ 119 million deal from january 2005 showed that he had all of baseball 's five tools but lacked a conditioned ocular enhancer : a gadget that throws numbered , colored tennis balls over 150 mph to help players pick up the speed of a pitched ball			1
there 's a clause in the contract requiring that the @entity10 lease the machine and retain an operator for it			0
@entity254 's family rode in style lots of players have free - plane - ticket perks written into their contracts , but some feel that air travel really lacks that we 're - going - to - the - prom feeling you can only get from a long limo ride			1
when current @entity266 flamethrower @entity254 signed with @entity267 as a free agent in december 2005 , he required that his wife receive eight round - trip limo rides from his home in @entity272 to @entity267 each season			0
that 's around nine hours in a limo each way , which is enough time to move the little divider between you and the driver up and down roughly 3,500 times			0
@entity0 : a baseball card quiz 13			0
@entity282 pulls in cash in the minors this last one 's actually a basketball contract			0
@entity282 's abrupt departure from basketball to play minor league baseball following the @entity291 ' 1993 championship campaign struck a number of observers as odd			0
how could @entity282 quit playing hoops and leave all of that money on the table ? as it turns out , " his airness " was losing less cash than we all thought			0
@entity291 owner @entity301 also owned the @entity302 , the team @entity282 was playing for in the minors			0
even though @entity282 was technically retired from basketball , @entity301 paid @entity282 his $ 4 million salaries for the @entity291 seasons he missed .			0

some baseball players ' contracts have included creative , generous or ludicrous perks
a $ 300 bonus for growing a mustache ; bulldozer for winning @entity315
@entity222 got $ 333,333 check when he did n't tip scales too far at six weigh - ins
three @entity92 got shares in apartment complexes as signing bonuses
