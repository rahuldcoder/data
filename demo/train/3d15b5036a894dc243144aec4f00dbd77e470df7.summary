-- if you have lived a happy , normal , @entity3 life , you have probably never heard of something so tedious and alien as a @entity6			0
but strange as it sounds , the obscure @entity6 is at the heart of a very small -- but very significant -- fight for @entity3 freedom			2
so , what is an mtb ? it works like this			0
every day , you and i use materials that come from other countries			0
from umbrellas to medicines to cars , even if they are made in the @entity3 , their plastics and chemicals and other raw components are often imported			0
frequently , these raw materials are taxed at the border with federal tariffs , even if such products are n't produced in the @entity3 and therefore must be imported			0
and so , every year , hundreds of @entity3 companies ask @entity26 for relief from one or another tariff in the form of a " duty suspension " - essentially a waiver on the tariff			2
these suspensions can typically save an @entity3 company hundreds of thousands of dollars that in turn allows them to keep more @entity3 employed , while giving consumers access to less expensive , higher quality products we might otherwise go without			0
each particular duty suspension must first be introduced as its own bill			0
they all get referred to the same congressional committees , which then pass them along to the @entity45 , which vets the merits of the application and sends back the approved ones packaged into -- you guessed it -- a @entity6 , which passes the @entity51 and @entity52 without any objection from anyone			0
it 's a bipartisan no - brainer			0
except , well , look at that first step again			0
each individual tariff suspension has to be turned into a special bill and introduced by the company 's representative or senator			2
why ? why ca n't companies just petition the @entity45 directly , since they 're the agency that reviews the applications anyway ? i mean , who could possibly benefit from a process whereby nonpolitical companies , rightly focused on their customers and products , are forced by @entity71 to hire a lobbyist and pony up cash for re-election campaigns in order to get something the law says they deserve ? who , indeed ? the process is worse than unfair and inefficient ; it 's fundamentally un-republican and un-democratic			1
if an application to suspend a tariff has merit , small businesses should n't be forced to grovel and kiss the ring of their own public servant to get it suspended			1
this is why this bad process has been treated just like spending earmarks under @entity51 and @entity52 rules for years and why republicans in the @entity51 and @entity52 included limited tariff benefits as part of the earmark ban after 2010 elections			1
some want to restart this part of the political favor factory and hope @entity3 do n't notice @entity91 breaking their own earmark ban , and others want to redefine earmarks to create a loophole for tariff suspensions			1
but the whole purpose of the earmark ban was to change the way we do business , not to change the definitions and rules of earmarks to pretend bad behavior is suddenly alright			1
and we wonder why @entity71 's approval rating is in the single digits			1
that 's why i have introduced bipartisan legislation to end this odious practice and reform the @entity6 process once and for all			1
the bill , co-sponsored by sen. @entity119 , @entity120 , streamlines the @entity6 process by allowing manufacturers to petition the trade commission directly			1
under our reformed process , once these requests have been properly vetted , the trade commission can make its recommendations to @entity71			1
@entity71 would retain its authority over trade policy and the ability to assist constituent companies with the @entity6 process , while the time and money saved from cutting out the lobbying process will benefit small businesses and their consumers , to say nothing of disinfecting the ugly , quasi-feudalism of the current pay - to - play racket			1
our legislation would level the playing field for small businesses			1
as it is , the companies that obtain duty suspensions are too often those that can afford the most expensive , well - connected lobbyists			0
our proposal allows every business to bring its case before a group of independent commissioners at the trade commission right from the start ; no longer will large corporations be able to buy their way to the front of the line			2
cleaning up bureaucracy and giving small businesses a fair shake in @entity26 is just one small step toward helping a few more citizens to go back to enjoying a happier and more normal @entity3 life			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			2

sen. @entity164 : manufacturers who want tariff exemptions must get ok from @entity71
he says the result is a process akin to *budget* earmarks in which lobbying is key
@entity164 , who is @entity91 , and a @entity175 are sponsoring legislation to change *system*
@entity164 : our legislation would level the playing field for small business
