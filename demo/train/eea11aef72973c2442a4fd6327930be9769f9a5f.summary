every 15 seconds , a @entity0 becomes a refugee , and those witnessing the violence unfolding on the ground do n't believe military action against the regime would bring relief			1
while a doctor who treats refugees says the regime has a history of becoming more vicious when backed into a corner , one @entity0 says he does n't believe strikes against @entity11 's forces would be effective because the regime would protect its own people and leave the rest to die so it could blame the massacre on the @entity21			1
" we are stuck in the middle , between the @entity25 and the @entity21 , the @entity26 and the @entity27 , and we are the victims , " the man said			0
the @entity29 ' refugee agency said tuesday that the number of @entity0 who have fled their war - ravaged country has now risen to more than 2 million			1
a year ago , that number was 230,671			0
are chemical weapons a ' red line ' ? tell us what you think			0
" @entity0 is haemorrhaging women , children and men who cross borders often with little more than the clothes on their backs , " the @entity39 said			1
the increase of nearly 1.8 million people over the past 12 months is an " alarming " trend , the agency said , warning that there is " no sign of this tragic outflow ending			1
" also disturbing is that many of the refugees are escaping only to find themselves in a different sort of danger			2
@entity57 , a 25 - year - old mother of three in neighboring @entity59 's @entity58 , said she and a friend visited a local organization that was distributing food and were told they needed to drive to a nearby warehouse			2
there , they encountered a group of men			0
aid worker : @entity0 refugee crisis creating long - term burden for neighbors " they attacked us			2
we started to scream and cry , " the woman said , explaining the men attempted to rape them and asked , " why are you scared ? nothing happened			0
why are you afraid of this ? it 's not your first time			0
" @entity57 said she could n't report the men			2
" they will kill me , or they will send me to my parents , and they will kill me			0
we are a tribal society , " she said			0
another refugee , 14 - year - old @entity87 in @entity88 , said she was cornered by teenagers while on her way to clean houses , which she 's been doing for extra money			0
they made me hate life , " the girl said			0
her mother said her daughter told her , " @entity99 , i would rather die in our country than have these problems			2
" the @entity29 has said that more than 100,000 people -- including many civilians -- have been killed in @entity0 since a popular uprising spiraled into a civil war in 2011			1
" @entity0 has become the great tragedy of this century -- a disgraceful humanitarian calamity with suffering and displacement unparalleled in recent history , " said @entity107 , the @entity29 ' high commissioner for refugees			1
@entity0 : what do the neighbors think of potential @entity116 strikes ? and there 's more somber news : another 4.25 million people are displaced inside @entity0 , the @entity39 said , meaning that more than 6 million people have been torn from their homes in the country			1
" more @entity0 are now forcibly displaced than is the case with any other country , " the agency said			1
the overwhelming majority of the refugees who leave @entity0 end up staying in countries in the surrounding region , and the @entity39 said it has less than 50 % of the funds it needs to meet their basic needs			1
that places a heavy strain on the infrastructures , economies and societies of those host countries , the @entity29 said			0
the four biggest recipients of @entity0 registered as refugees or awaiting registration are : @entity59 -- 716,000 @entity142 -- 515,000 @entity143 -- 460,000 @entity144 -- 168,000 government ministers from those four countries will meet with the @entity39 in @entity147 wednesday in an effort to generate greater international support for dealing with the refugee exodus			1
@entity151 , executive director of the human rights group @entity152 , which is building a refugee camp in @entity59 , encouraged residents in neighboring countries to open their homes to refugees as prospects for housing them become thinner			1
" we will be able to host up to 1,200 families			0
that 's around 10,000 people , but that 's nothing compared to the influx that 's expected			2
lots of people will stay in the streets , " he said			2
more than half of the 2 million @entity0 refugees are children age 17 or younger , the @entity29 said			1
the @entity173 @entity172 suggested that the @entity29 figure for the total number of refugees may well be too conservative			2
" to have reached this landmark figure of 2 million registered refugees is shocking , but the true figure is likely to be higher , " said @entity177 , a disaster manager for the @entity173 group			1
" we know there are people who will not have registered for support , for many reasons			0
they may be afraid of any form of authority or of registering their status			0
" the organization said that in @entity142 , 70 % of refugees live in urban areas rather than in camps , which makes it harder for aid agencies to find and help them			1
" our colleagues from the @entity142 @entity172 report finding families who have not registered , or are worried about coming forward to ask for support , " @entity177 said			1
" they are still living with the psychological effects of having been in a conflict zone , and that makes people wary			0
