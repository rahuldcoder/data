-- join me in a thought experiment			0
take two individuals , @entity3 and @entity4 is a naturally gifted professional immersed in a hyper - competitive field where performance is publicly scrutinized and frequently re-evaluated			0
continuous pressure makes a seek any advantage to excel			0
he takes medications to gain a physical advantage over competitors while risking chronic health problems			1
@entity16 is a talented and motivated employee who has made innumerable sacrifices to get ahead at work			0
she is stressed by the knowledge that her productivity is always being analyzed and feels pressured to use any possible advantage to be the best			0
she takes a medication that makes her mentally sharper but could endanger her health			1
@entity3 is maligned baseball star @entity26			1
@entity16 is your co-worker with the newly acquired job title who seems to work 90 hours per week , escaping fatigue by inexplicable means			0
opinion : how @entity26 let us down is there really a significant difference between a and @entity16 , other than how much a has been publicly criticized ? not really			1
their actions stem from the same premise : in competitive professional environments , winners do whatever is necessary to triumph			0
your new vp may lack @entity26 's bulk and salary , but they share a common style			1
@entity26 was recently suspended for 211 games for an alleged connection to a @entity52 clinic that has been accused of supplying professional athletes with performance - enhancing drugs			1
even casual fans realize this action is the equivalent of a guilty verdict for doping			0
your enthusiastically efficient , work - obsessed colleague with the new job title and beautifully renovated office down the hall shares a similar philosophy as athletes accused of doping : take advantage of any available mechanism to succeed			1
consequently , @entity16 pursues the controversial advantage conferred by " neuroenhancement " medications			1
in theory , these act as steroids for the mind			0
they include mixed amphetamine salts and other medications approved to treat attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder , or @entity78			1
whether or not the medications objectively enhance cognitive performance is still under investigation			0
there are theorized risks of increased rates of hypertension , heart failure and psychosis with their use , but there is no definitive evidence that the use of neuroenhancement medications imposes these risks			1
nonetheless , some researchers are documenting that @entity96 college students and professionals are increasingly using neuroenhancement medications for " nonprescription use , " which may include the use of the medication in healthy adults seeking a cognitive advantage			1
as contentious as the research on neuroenhancement may be , there is even less controlled research looking at the objective results and adverse effects of performance - enhancing drugs in athletics			2
regardless of the outcomes that these medications achieve , the motivations of their consumers are the same			0
whether doping for physical or cognitive enhancement , both parties are using medications with indeterminate efficacy and risk to obtain an advantage			2
the only difference is the level of regulation and scrutiny of the abusers and who is more likely to be punished for the abuse			0
fear of public shaming and prosecution should not drive decision - making when it comes to the illegal use of performance - enhancing drugs			0
@entity26 has a large number of critics ; at least one of them must have tried neuroenhancement to dominate in the office			1
this person may label @entity26 as a " doper " and question the validity of his achievements without acknowledging that his or her motivations may stem from similar desires			1
fans who are critical of athletes need to apply the same standards to themselves and to the people in their lives			2
a pharmacologically derived professional advantage in the office should not be seen as more appropriate than a similar advantage gained in a stadium			2
@entity26 could potentially sit for hundreds of games as a consequence of the accusations against him			2
maybe your new vp should forfeit that fancy new office for 211 days to maintain a moral norm			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .			2

@entity170 : people who take neuroenhancement drugs to be sharper similar to @entity26 case
@entity170 says some may take mixed amphetamine salts , used to treat @entity78 , to gain advantage
he says these medications may carry health risks but wo *n't* get high achievers fired at work
@entity170 : perhaps professionals should face same scrutiny as athletes such as @entity26
