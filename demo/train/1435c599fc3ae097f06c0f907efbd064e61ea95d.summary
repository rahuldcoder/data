-- with three places up for grabs on the @entity6 @entity5 track team , two women tied for third place in the women 's 100 meters over the weekend -- crossing the line at exactly the same time -- which means the coveted @entity5 spot could be decided by a coin toss			1
sprinters @entity13 and @entity15 threw their bodies across the finish line so evenly matched that cameras recording 3,000 frames a second could n't tell who beat whom			1
both runners recorded precisely the same finishing time , down to thousandths of a second : 11.068 seconds			2
two women beat @entity27 and @entity15 : @entity28 and @entity29			1
their first and second place finishes on saturday give them the chance to represent the @entity6 at the @entity5 in @entity34 this summer			1
but the photo finish leaves @entity36 with a dilemma : who gets the third slot ? there appears to be no precedent for a dead heat at @entity44 track and field trials , prompting the @entity44 to announce new rules sunday			1
one of the runners can give up her claim to a spot on the @entity5 team			2
if neither one takes that unlikely option , they 'll be asked if they want to run a tie - breaking race or flip a coin			2
if they choose the same option , the committee will respect their wishes			0
if they disagree , they 'll have to race for it			0
and if both athletes refuse to declare a preference , officials will flip a coin -- a @entity6 quarter to be exact			1
leaving nothing to chance , other than the flip itself , the rules also detail who gets to pick heads or tails and how the coin should be flipped			0
" the @entity36 representative shall bend his or her index finger at a 90 - degree angle to his or her thumb , allowing the coin to rest on his or her thumb , " the rules say			0
no date has been set for the tie - breaker to take			0
both women have other races to run over the course of the week .			0

@entity13 and @entity15 cross the line at exactly the same time , cameras show
@entity5 officials are giving them the choice of a *rematch* or a coin toss
there does n't appear to be any precedent in @entity6 @entity5 trials for a dead heat
