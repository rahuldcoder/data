@entity0 , @entity1 -- question : why use chemical weapons ? answer : because you want to get the job done fast			1
nerve agents and other battlefield chemicals are an area weapon			0
be it town or trench where your enemy is hiding , your deadly gas will find them			0
from the waterlogged northern @entity18 plains of @entity19 to the arid mountains and marshes of the @entity24 - @entity23 conflict , chemical weapons have been used when armies get bogged down and commanders get frustrated			1
when the urge to win outweighs warfare 's cold calculus of routine slaughter and indignity , the danger is a slide into the depravity of craven criminality			0
@entity36 used them in his extermination camps , diabolical in his annihilation of his enemies			1
so when i heard from two separate sources close to @entity50 president @entity49 's thinking that he planned to retake the country 's largest city @entity53 in a " swift battle of high causalities " so he could go to peace talks in @entity57 with " facts on the ground " in his favor , the use of chemicals in @entity44 ' suburbs against resurgent rebels made sense			1
as told to me , the @entity50 army hoped by mid-august to have control of @entity64 , and by early - september to be wrapping up victory in war - ravaged @entity53			1
in late - july , following june 's strategic victory in @entity71 of cutting rebel supply lines , @entity49 's ambitions to get the country back in his control were on the rise			1
but two things happened , rebels attacked @entity78 stronghold @entity76 on the coast , temporarily distracting regime forces			0
the @entity76 thrust was soon repulsed but not without shaking @entity49 's new found confidence			2
second and more worryingly for him , rebels in the capital , loosely termed the " @entity91 " by one regional source involved in supplying them with weapons and honing their fighting skills , were becoming a serious irritant			0
for over a year loose - knit bands of rebel fighters have nipped at the regime 's achilles heel , @entity44 , with little strategic effect			0
always a pressure point on the regime 's military resources , the capital has the potential to distract the leadership			0
by mid-august , better - trained and better - equipped rebels were threatening to throw the regime off its agenda and stall strikes on @entity53			2
a quandary for @entity49 , what should he do ? the heat was no doubt turned up on his @entity44 commanders : get results to free assets for the north			2
into that walked the @entity116 chemical weapons inspectors			1
the rest seems to be history .			0

sources close to @entity49 say he planned to take @entity53 in " swift battle of high causalities "
chemical weapons are often used when armies are strained , leaders are frustrated
@entity36 used chemical agents in gas *chambers*
