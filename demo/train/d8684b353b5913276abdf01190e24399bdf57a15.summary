he 's been photographed dropping vases before -- but that does n't mean it 's ok for just anyone to do it			2
@entity6 has made a name for himself by not only creating visually arresting and thought - provoking art , but for his uncompromising activism in opposition to the @entity12 government			1
@entity6 was on the receiving end of a protest this weekend when a local @entity16 artist smashed a " color basis " vase valued at $ 1 million , part of the artist 's " according to what ? " exhibition at the @entity16 ( @entity21 ) in the city			1
the exhibition also included photographs of the @entity12 artist dropping what appears to be a @entity28 urn			1
@entity29 , a @entity16 - based artist , was named in a police affidavit as the defendant			1
he told an officer that his act was a protest against the gallery 's decision to only display international art. the police report states that @entity29 picked up the vase before being advised to put it down by a museum official			1
he then dropped it " in protest			0
" he was charged with criminal mischief			0
questionable protest @entity6 , meanwhile , told @entity46 that he did n't have " much reaction " to the news , but said that he thought that a line should be drawn when it came to damaging public or private property as part of a protest			1
" i ca n't have a show in @entity56 but i can not go to museums to break work in @entity56 , " he said in a phone interview			0
" my work is basically forbidden to be shown in @entity12 ... the protest itself may be valid but to damage somebody 's work to do that is questionable			1
" @entity6 said that he considered his work -- specifically the triptych which shows him dropping an antique urn -- to be " very different			2
" " my work belongs to me , it does n't belong to the public and also it does n't [ belong to ] somebody else			0
" he said he believes he has been contacted by the gallery but he is n't taking the loss too seriously			0
" i do n't really care much and actually my work is often damaged in different shows , because it 's fragile , so normally i do n't take these things too highly			2
damage is damage , you know			0
if they have insurance , maybe it will be covered			0
" art in @entity12 : on script and cutting edge ? condemnation the museum issued a statement concerning the incident , condemning @entity29 's act			2
" although the museum ca n't speak directly to intentions , evidence suggests that this was a premeditated act , " a @entity21 statement read			0
" as an art museum dedicated to celebrating modern and contemporary artists from within our community and around the world , we have the highest respect for freedom of expression , but this destructive act is vandalism and disrespectful to another artist and his work , to @entity16 , and to our community			2
" @entity29 told the @entity106 that " it was a spontaneous protest " and that he " lifted the vase and let it smash on the floor like @entity6 did in his picture then waited for authorities peacefully and never resisted punishment			1
" @entity6 rocks out against detention			0
