@entity0 -- when @entity4 was 10 - years old , her mother told her babies are born from armpits			2
" i thought that 's strange , because there 's no hole there , " @entity4 recalls , adding that she " had absolutely nothing " in terms of sex ed when she was growing up in @entity10 in the 1970s , beyond what her mother told her			2
now a journalist writing for @entity18 - language publications , @entity4 publicly revealed her own experience of molestation by a schoolteacher in a recent opinion piece on the severity of child sex abuse in @entity25			1
@entity4 is part of a growing number of voices calling for better sex education to combat child sex abuse , rising rates of sexually transmitted diseases , and unwanted pregnancies			1
" with so little sex education and knowledge , you become very vulnerable to abuse , " says @entity4			1
sex education is taught inadequately in school and avoided by parents , resulting in generations of @entity25 children growing up wondering if babies come out of armpits , or from the garbage dump , as others have also cited			1
" we 've never had a class on sex ed at my school			0
we 're not even allowed to have a boyfriend or a girlfriend			0
no kissing , nothing , " says @entity53 , an 18 - year - old student at a top boarding school in wealthy @entity55			0
her teachers simply told her she would " be in trouble " if she had a boyfriend			0
no incentive typically , @entity25 students are taught the basic anatomical differences between the sexes and little else			1
there 's no real incentive for educator or student to learn about it			0
it then becomes a vicious cycle : no one learns about it so no one is in a position to later teach it			0
but the puritanical classrooms hardly translate to a prudish society			0
a 2012 survey by the @entity81 journal showed that 70 % of @entity25 have engaged in pre-marital sex , up from just 15 % of those surveyed in 1989			1
top - down efforts to make sex education part of the compulsory education curriculum were seen at the @entity87 this past march when two committee members spoke out about the issue			1
meanwhile , @entity25 internet users have taken matters into their own hands , posting videos that teach crucial sex facts in one - minute clips , with some going viral and being watched millions of times			1
nothing to be desired the repercussions of a population in the dark about the bedroom are vast			0
sexually transmitted infections ( @entity103 ) are on the ascent and @entity25 has particularly high rates of syphilis , while sexual transmission now accounts for 81.7 % of all new hiv infections			2
unwanted pregnancies are also rife			1
@entity25 has a staggering 13 million annual abortions , according to recent data published by @entity25 's @entity112 in 2013			2
in one instance a teenage girl underwent 13 abortions			0
these numbers would lower significantly if @entity25 women knew how to use contraception effectively -- but most do n't			2
the lack of sex education plagues rural and urban areas equally			1
@entity123 is a market researcher , investigating sexual health as part of her job			0
she had never heard of the human papilloma virus ( @entity129 ) , a commonly transmitted std responsible for 70 % of cervical cancer cases worldwide			0
@entity123 only found out about it when her company put her in charge of work related to the hpv vaccine , which in @entity25 , is only available in @entity0			2
@entity123 remembers her own sex education			1
it consisted of watching one 45 - minute - long video explaining sexual differences between boys and girls			1
@entity123 says it reinforced gender stereotypes of girls as passive and boys as active and aggressive			0
herein lies a dark consequence of poor sex education : females are particularly compromised			1
a recent report from the @entity152 revealed a shocking 22.2 % of 998 @entity25 males surveyed had raped a woman			2
children also do n't have the knowledge to protect themselves from unwanted sexual attention			2
a total of 125 cases of sexual assault on children were reported in 2013			1
@entity162 , author of " @entity163 : sex in @entity25 , " says knowledge is as important for empowering potential victims as it is for curbing aggressors			1
" better sexual education would teach men to respect women more and be sensitive to their sexual needs , including the right to say ' no , ' " he says			1
dirty talk when the @entity175 came to power in 1949 , talking about sex became strictly taboo			2
it was erased from public life , especially during the @entity180 when men and women squeezed into gender - neutral @entity184 jackets and all energy was directed towards the revolutionary cause			0
this changed during @entity25 's opening up period starting in the mid- 1970s			2
as years of state - sponsored puritanism began to dissolve , the first sex education courses were instated in @entity191 , in 1981			1
the same year saw the @entity192 announcing sex ed classes would be established in all middle schools throughout the country			0
even then , the government preached abstention over indulgence			0
for example , the 1988 sex education charter warned adolescents of the dangers of premarital sex			1
ultimately , a prudish attitude prevails and as yet no standardized and authoritative teaching materials have been issued on the topic			0
the government approach dovetails with its concerns over " polluted " and " unhealthy " material : references to sex , including kissing , are constantly edited out of public life , such as the sex scenes cut from @entity216 's " @entity215 " or more recently , the censoring of an on - stage lesbian kiss during the @entity219			2
educators have also largely ignored what calls the government has made to improve sex education			1
in part , teachers are too embarrassed to cover the subject , but primarily they concentrate on meeting their own academic targets			0
sex is not a subject tested in the all - important university entrance exam and teachers have little incentive to emphasize the subject			1
" at school the focus is to get students to score high in exams in order to get them into good universities			0
sex education is not considered important , " @entity4 explains			1
parents spur this on , pressuring their children to concentrate on academics above all else			0
@entity4 adds that confucian thought does n't encourage open discussion of sex			0
as a popular saying goes : " @entity247 is the worst of all wicked things ; filial piety is the best of all good things			0
" @entity255 obstacles traditional @entity25 medicine offers advice on coitus that can be at odds with modern science -- again impeding honest talk about sex			1
" there are big gaps between western concepts and @entity25 traditional culture , " says @entity263 , president of the @entity264			2
within traditional @entity25 thought , semen is believed to be more precious than blood , with one drop said to equal 10 drops of blood			2
excessive sexual activity that causes the loss of semen from the body is thought to be harmful , explains @entity263			0
the combination of misinformation and lack of teachers who are qualified on the subject is toxic , says @entity263			0
" contradictions arise between radical and conservative , right and wrong			0
the radical may explain the use of condoms in middle school while the conservative still insist on abstinence in college			0
someone says puppy love is beneficial , while someone says puppy love should be prohibited , " says @entity263			0
he adds that only one college in the country -- @entity299 -- offers an academic minor in sex education			1
protecting the future with few avenues for young @entity25 to turn to for information , the @entity305 and the arts have become key educators			1
an online survey showed that 88 % of @entity25 youth polled said they had learned about sex on their own			1
there are signs of change			0
in light of child abuse cases , the issue of @entity25 's poor sex education has recently gained traction			1
there 's growing support amongst parents for improvements and the government released a teaching outline in march for sex education lessons			1
it offers step - by - step guidance on how to instruct primary school children to better protect themselves from sexual abuse			2
many ngos are also aiding the dissemination of knowledge			0
@entity263 's organisation is one example , but he lists a series of other social organizations , such as the @entity339 and @entity340 , who have all done " a great deal to promote sex education in @entity25			1
" @entity344 , country director from ngo @entity345 , which was established in @entity25 in 2000 , says they aim " to empower young people to have open and informed attitudes towards love , sex and life " through a series of services			2
their best known initiative is the @entity359 clinics , where young people can receive information on family planning .			0

sex - related social issues on the rise in @entity25 , including sexual assault , stds , unwanted pregnancies
sex education is key to *eradicating* these problems , but educators have little incentive to teach
traditional beliefs impede honest talk about sex
a one - minute @entity25 video explaining important sex facts goes viral online
