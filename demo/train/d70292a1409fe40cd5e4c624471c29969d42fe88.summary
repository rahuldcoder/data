the gridlock and partisanship that threatens to ruin @entity2 in @entity3 could be an election year gift for president @entity6 's campaign			1
a growing number of voters , 50 % compared to 44 % in march , trust @entity6 to solve the nation 's problems while the percentage of those with faith in congressional @entity14 is slipping , according to a @entity16 / @entity15			1
@entity16 poll : president 's approval nearing 50 % for the @entity6 team , the poll numbers seem to validate the president 's fall and winter strategy : intone the jobs message like a mantra while squaring off against a do - nothing @entity27 and congressional @entity14 in particular			1
" we ca n't wait for an increasingly dysfunctional @entity27 to do its job			0
where they wo n't act , i will , " the president told a @entity32 audience in october			2
@entity27 has accomplished a few things , passing trade bills and a tax credit for unemployed veterans			0
but thanks to repeated failed votes on elements of the jobs bill and leaving town for the holidays with a payroll tax extension unresolved , the lasting image is one of inaction			0
@entity49 : payroll tax cut showdown ' harming ' the @entity14 call it a self - inflicted wound			2
when the president began the jobs push with his speech to @entity27 on september 8 , his approval rating was at 43 %			1
the new @entity16 / @entity15 poll shows it now at 49 %			1
that 's the highest it has been since @entity62 was killed and up 5 points since november			0
what 's happened in a month ? on december 6 , the president doubled down on his jobs message with a speech in @entity68 in which he promised to work toward an economy that promotes fairness and opportunity for all @entity72			1
" i believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot , when everyone does their fair share and when everyone plays by the same rules			0
... they 're @entity72 values , and we have to reclaim them , " he said			0
meanwhile , @entity27 has failed to pass an extension of a payroll tax cut , which could cost $ 1,000 a year for an average family and affects about 160 million @entity72			0
the president 's campaign aides also see the poll numbers as a reaction to a contentious @entity14 primary			1
" these numbers will go up and down			0
but the debates over the last few months have clearly had an impact , " said @entity94 , @entity6 2012 deputy campaign manager			1
" on one side they 've seen a president fighting to reclaim the security of the middle class and on the other side a group of people sort of paying lip service to the middle class , then actively working against them			0
that does n't go unnoticed and the data is beginning to show that			0
" there 's a difference between putting middle class in your talking points and actually doing something about what they 're going through			0
" @entity14 are quick to point out that the president is starting from historic lows for an incumbent			2
" these numbers are better than they were in november but it 's nothing to be jumping up and down about			2
instead of being really , really bad , it 's just really bad for the president , " said @entity14 pollster @entity123			1
the @entity16 / @entity15 poll also shows that the @entity14 brand has suffered			1
only 43 % of voters have a favorable view of the @entity14 , down 6 points since june , while the numbers for the @entity132 have held steady at 55 %			1
the view of the @entity14 has slipped since the debt - ceiling debacle and top @entity132 operatives are convinced the @entity14 has taken more of the blame for the gridlock in @entity3			1
they believe the @entity14 is likely to take a further hit if the payroll tax cuts are n't extended			2
however , it 's unclear how the payroll tax cuts standoff will play in the end , because @entity6 's re-election hopes are tied to the overall health of the economy			2
if @entity27 fails to act , recession would be a " significant threat , " said @entity149 of @entity150			0
and few fates are worse for an incumbent president than running against a recession .			0

when @entity6 began his jobs push , his approval rating was 43 % , new poll has it at 49 %
president 's campaign aides see the rise as partly a reaction to the @entity14 primary battle
poll also says @entity14 brand has suffered ; 43 % of voters have a favorable view of the @entity14
numbers for the @entity132 have held steady at 55 %
