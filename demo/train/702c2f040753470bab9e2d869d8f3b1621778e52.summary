-- august 17 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : a new beginning , but some things stay the same : 10 minutes , no commercials , the top news of the day , and me ! i 'm @entity20			1
you 're tuned in to @entity0			2
let 's get started ! first up : @entity22 @entity23 : controversy leads off today 's show			1
it 's about an @entity28 center that includes a mosque , an @entity28 place of worship , and about where it might be built : a few blocks away from @entity35 , the spot in @entity4 that was attacked on 9/11			1
some people argue that it is insensitive to build a mosque so close to @entity35			1
in a recent @entity0 poll , nearly 70 percent of @entity40 were against this plan			2
others say having the @entity28 center there could help promote understanding			1
last week , president @entity46 weighed in			2
@entity40 president @entity46 : @entity47 have the right to practice their religion as everyone else in this country			2
that includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower @entity57			1
@entity23 : okay , now some people took that statement to mean that the president is in favor of the @entity35 mosque			1
a day later , he claimed he was talking about a larger issue			2
@entity46 : i was not commenting , and i will not comment , on the wisdom of making a decision to put a mosque there			2
i was commenting very specifically on the right that people have that dates back to our founding			2
@entity23 : president @entity46 is taking some heat for how he 's handled this situation and for what he 's said			1
@entity79 @entity78 , ( r ) @entity4 : if the president was going to get into this , he should have been much more clear , much more precise			2
and you ca n't be changing your position from day to day on an issue which does go to our @entity85 , and it also goes to extreme sensitivity			0
so , that 's where i am critical of the president , for not being clear			1
@entity23 : putting aside the political reaction , there 's a personal reaction to the proposed mosque			1
listen to what a couple @entity4 had to say about it			0
woman on the street : i think it 's terrible			1
it does n't have anything to do with freedom of religion			0
it 's making a point			1
there 's plenty of realty all over @entity57			1
there 's plenty of realty everywhere			1
it should n't be here			0
@entity111 : i 'm glad he interjected because the @entity47 have the right to prayer			0
we have synagogues , we have churches everywhere			0
i 'm proud of him ; i 'm proud of the @entity40			0
@entity122 @entity23 : definitely controversial , an issue that people have a lot of strong feelings about			0
we want to hear yours ! if you go to @entity129 , you scroll down a bit and click on our blog , " from a to z with @entity20 , " you can weigh in			0
what do you think about a mosque being built near @entity35 ? are you for it , against it ? and why ? log on and share your thoughts today			1
is this legit ? @entity139 , @entity14 : is this legit ? the @entity40 has the world 's largest economy			1
it 's true ! the @entity40 is the biggest			1
as far as the second largest goes , though ... @entity143 ? @entity23 : and that 's where things get a little tricky			1
see , @entity147 has been the world 's second largest economy , but @entity5 is catching up			1
according to a new report , over the last quarter -- the last three months -- @entity5 passed @entity147			1
that does n't necessarily mean @entity5 has taken over the number 2 spot			1
we have to wait until the end of the year to find out about that			0
but as @entity157 explains , it might be a foregone conclusion			0
( begin video ) @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 : according to these new numbers , @entity147 's economic output in the second quarter fell slightly short of @entity5 's			1
now , for a long time , it has not been a question of if , but when @entity5 's economy would overtake @entity147 's as the second largest economy in the world			1
but , and this is a big but , if you look at the numbers for the first half of this year so far , @entity147 's economy is still bigger than @entity5 's			1
so , analysts are saying we have to wait until after the end of this year , until we get the final numbers for 2010 , before we can make a judgment on this			0
there are a lot of factors at play here			0
in @entity147 , the economy is obviously slowing down , stimulus efforts are slowing down , exports are down and domestic demand is flat			1
the yen is also at a 15 - year high against the dollar , so that makes @entity147 exports more expensive for overseas customers			0
but here in @entity5 , the economy is also showing signs of slowing down			1
gdp growth in the first quarter fell from 11.9 percent to 10.3 percent in the second quarter , and stimulus efforts here are also on the verge of slowing down			0
and if indeed @entity5 does revalue its currency soon , that would make @entity5 exports more expensive for overseas customers			1
so analysts , while most of them seem to agree that @entity5 will overtake @entity147 as the second largest economy in the world some time this year , we do have to wait for those annual numbers for 2010 to come out			1
@entity157 , @entity0 , @entity162			0
( @entity209 ) so what ? @entity23 : okay , @entity5 's economy is getting bigger			1
so what ? well , experts figure this stuff out by looking at the value of everything that a country makes			0
if your economy 's growing , that means you 're making and selling more products			1
so , @entity5 's making a lot of stuff			1
and the @entity40 -- remember , the @entity40 has the largest economy -- it 's making a lot , too			1
and that could mean competition between the @entity40 and @entity5 to sell all the products that they make			1
it could also mean opportunities for the countries to do more business with each other			0
@entity236 ( @entity237 ) military exercises @entity23 : that military drill lasts for 11 days			0
it happens every year ; the @entity40 and @entity241 work together to make sure they 're prepared to defend @entity241 , as the @entity40 and that country are allies			0
@entity241 's president says the military exercises are specifically designed to prepare against any threat from @entity248			1
we mentioned yesterday there 's been a lot of tension between these two countries			2
@entity248 offered its own response to the military drills			0
it threatened to " deal a merciless counterblow to the @entity40 imperialists " and to @entity241 " traitors			0
" kids sleeping @entity23 : well , i know a lot of you are dragging right now ; that switchover from sleeping late in summer to school hours can be a beast			0
would it make any difference to you if the school bell rang a half - hour later ? i 'm working on a report about that , looking for your input ! tell us when you think the bell should ring			0
tell us on our blog at @entity129 ! @entity279 @entity23 : so , we have established that school is back ; so is football ! some of you players have probably been hitting the practice field for a while now			1
no matter what team you 're on , this time of year , most everyone 's facing a common opponent : the heat			1
@entity289 shows us how a major college program beats the heat			1
( begin video ) @entity292 , @entity293 : each season , the @entity294 face bitter rivals like the @entity297 or @entity298			0
but an even tougher foe is the intense @entity301 heat			2
@entity302 , quarterback , @entity303 : i do n't think i 've ever gotten used to this heat			2
the best way i 've been able to adjust to it is drink more gatorades or waters			0
@entity309 : hydration : it is one method @entity303 trainer @entity313 stresses			0
but he also employs high - tech methods			0
@entity315 , @entity303 : try 100.23			0
@entity309 : @entity313 will pull a player from the field when their body temperature reaches 103			2
@entity320 : that 's when you can start to exhibit some of the more significant signs or symptoms of someone in heat stress			1
when they get to 104 , that 's when we pull them from practice or the workout			2
@entity309 : this is me after 20 minutes of light workout in the 105 degree heat			2
@entity294 , like most players in training , will undergo intense workouts in 45 - minute intervals			0
while doing so , @entity313 looks for danger signs			0
@entity320 : disorientation , any kind of decreased mental acuity , someone that 's beginning to labor a lot more in their drill			2
how about we go cool off ? @entity309 : that sounds great			0
one method is this shirt , fitted with a stem that allows a blast of cool air to fill its chambers			0
not quite as high tech , but more effective , is this , the rapid cooling tub			0
whoa ! may be crude , but it works			0
and that 's the mission of trainers like @entity313 to keep their players safe			2
@entity320 : a lot of us in athletic training have been witness , or been a part , or know people that have had to deal with someone that 's suffered from heat stroke or from a heat crisis			1
and that has really shaped some of the passion and some of the concerns that we have as a staff today at the @entity303			2
( @entity209 ) before we go @entity23 : finally today , when you hear about a police chase involving someone in black and white stripes , this probably is n't what you had in mind			2
the zebras did n't escape from the zoo			0
they were actually somebody 's pets ! they got scared by a dog , jumped the fence and took off , and scared local residents and led local authorities on a wild zebra chase around the neighborhood			2
when they were eventually caught , we can only assume how embarrassed the animals were by the whole incident			0
goodbye @entity23 : it probably left them black and white and red all over			0
seriously though , zebras as pets ? that owner must have a wild life			0
whoo ! @entity0 returns tomorrow			0
we 're gon na look forward to seeing you then .			0
