-- and then there were two			0
one is identified with the ethnic @entity4 group from northern @entity5 and is a former foreign minister who later became a critic of @entity5 president @entity8			1
the other is close to the president and belongs to his @entity12 ethnic group			0
both are technocrats who campaigned on a message of change			0
and each hopes to lead their turbulent nation into a brighter future			0
preliminary results from @entity5 's landmark presidential elections show former foreign minister @entity21 getting the most votes -- but not the majority needed to avoid a runoff with @entity25			1
the two men will face each other in a runoff slated for june 7 , according to @entity5 's @entity29			1
the preliminary results will be finalized may 14 after investigations into fraud complaints , according to commission			0
it 's the third election since the fall of the @entity36 in 2001 , and marks the first democratic handover of power in the fragile country			1
incumbent @entity8 is constitutionally bound to step down			1
@entity8 was once the darling of the @entity41 but has long since fallen out of favor amid cries of corruption and cronyism			1
with @entity48 troops scheduled to pull out of @entity5 by the end of the year , and following the refusal of @entity8 to sign a bilateral agreement -- the so - called @entity52 -- with the @entity53 to keep some troops in - country , @entity5 security is in the hands of the next man to be sworn in			1
@entity0 takes a look at the two contenders to be @entity5 's next leader			0
@entity21 an ophthalmologist and former @entity63 medic in a previous life , @entity21 was a vocal critic of the @entity36 during their years in power , and although he was a previous @entity8 ally , serving in his government as foreign minister , he has in later years been a thorn in the side of the man who has ruled @entity5 since the fall of the @entity36 in 2001			1
the urbane politician , known for his eloquence -- and his elegance -- took on @entity8 in 2009 's election but dropped out after the first round in protest to what he saw as large - scale voter fraud			1
his campaign this time around has been wracked with violence , with three separate attacks by militants on @entity21 campaigners in the weeks before the election , according to the @entity5 news agency , @entity86			1
" the environment is not risk - free , but when i look at the enthusiasm of the @entity5 people to participate in the elections -- that is part of it is encouraging			2
it is highly encouraging , " he told @entity0 's @entity93 earlier this year			0
as with many countries , both democratic and otherwise , loyalty along ethnic lines matters a great deal in @entity5			0
@entity12 make up more than half of the population in this multi-ethnic country , with @entity103 the second - largest group , and a number of minor @entity106 and other ethnic groups			1
@entity107 and part @entity12 , @entity21 is considered a relative outsider given his background			1
he is generally associated with his @entity4 side , giving him a possible advantage in reaching out to @entity115 voters , but which may work against him in a runoff if the other candidates back his @entity12 challenger			2
he is seen as a relatively liberal candidate and advocate of women 's engagement in public life , telling @entity125 's independent newspaper , " if you want to see this country or any other country even being able to deal with the challenges and develop , it can not happen without the role of half the population			2
" he has signaled his intention to sign the @entity52 with president @entity133 in an effort to offer his constituents some security following @entity48 '' s planned withdrawal at the end of 2014			0
@entity25 a former academic who previously taught at @entity141 and @entity142 in the @entity53 , @entity139 emerged as the dark horse candidate			2
a former @entity53 citizen who gave up his passport to run for the @entity5 presidency in 2009 , he 's known as having an impatient , fiery temper but also of being incredibly detail - oriented			2
another @entity149 man , @entity139 served as both an adviser to the current president and also as finance minister in his cabinet			0
he was working at the @entity154 in @entity155 during the september 11 attacks , and used the tragedy as a springboard for his re-engagement in @entity5 politics , returning to his home country just months after the event			2
considered a moderate , he says he has seen positive signs while campaigning around the country			0
" ( at ) rally after rally people are responding to a message of moderation , to message of reform , to message of transformation , to peace , stability and cooperation , " he told @entity0 's @entity165			0
watch : @entity0 's @entity93 interviews @entity25 his experience in the development agency was invaluable during his time in @entity8 's government , reconstructing the country , and he hopes voters will be convinced that it will stand him in equally good stead for the top job			1
a shrewd operator , @entity139 , who is @entity12 , has enlisted the support of ex-warlord general @entity190 , a native @entity191 , as his running mate			0
however , his many years in the @entity53 -- especially while his countrymen were suffering , first under the yoke of @entity196 imperialism and later the strictures of the @entity36 -- may impede him as he is seen as an outsider with strong ties to the @entity53 , which is seen by many as merely the latest foreign invaders of @entity5 soil .			0

@entity21 , @entity25 will be in a runoff slated for june 7
the two candidates won the most votes in field of 11
