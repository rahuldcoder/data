@entity0 -- jurors in the involuntary manslaughter trial of @entity5 's doctor tuesday heard dramatic opening statements and a startling recording of the pop singer , his words slow and slurred as he talks about his planned comeback concerts			1
prosecutors portrayed dr. @entity12 as motivated by money , while the defense contended @entity12 's superstar client self - administered a fatal mix of drugs			1
witnesses gave varying accounts of @entity5 's condition as he prepared for the shows in @entity22			1
@entity12 abandoned " all principles of medical care " in attending to @entity5 , prosecutor @entity23 said in his opening statement			1
defense attorney @entity27 countered , saying @entity5 's death was " tragic , but the evidence will not show that dr. @entity12 did it			1
" @entity12 acquired massive quantities of the powerful surgical anesthetic propofol to help @entity5 sleep , giving him a final dose of the drug after a long , restless night when the singer begged for help sleeping , according to recordings played by prosecutors			1
@entity12 gave in to @entity5 's demands not because it was the right medical decision , but because he was motivated by a $ 150,000 a month contract to serve as @entity5 's doctor , @entity23 said			1
" the evidence in this case will show that @entity5 trusted his life to the medical skills of @entity12 , unequivocally that that misplaced trust had far too high a price to pay , " @entity23 said			1
" that misplaced trust in the hands of @entity12 cost @entity5 his life			1
" @entity5 fans create bizarre scene outside courthouse jurors heard a may 10 , 2009 , recording , captured by @entity12 's @entity59 , of @entity5 " highly under the influences of unknown agents , " as he talked about his planned comeback concert , according to @entity23			1
" we have to be phenomenal , " @entity5 said in a low voice , his speech slurred			2
" when people leave this show , when people leave my show , i want them to say , ' i 've never seen nothing like this in my life			0
i 've never seen nothing like this			0
he 's the greatest entertainer in the world			0
' i 'm taking that money , a million children , children 's hospital , the biggest in the world , @entity5 's @entity81			1
" the tape , prosecutors say , is evidence that @entity12 knew about @entity5 's health problems weeks before his death			1
jurors also saw a video of the superstar rehearsing at the @entity90 in @entity0 the night before he died			2
@entity5 sang and danced to " @entity91 , " the last song he would rehearse on stage			2
prosecutors also presented a photo of @entity5 's lifeless body on a hospital gurney , about 12 hours later			1
if convicted of involuntary manslaughter , @entity12 , who wiped away tears during his lawyer 's opening statement , could spend four years in a @entity104 prison and lose his medical license			1
@entity106 blamed @entity5 's death on drugs that he said @entity12 had neither given to @entity5 nor known about			1
scientific evidence will show that , on the morning @entity5 died , he swallowed a sedative without his doctor 's knowledge , " enough to put six of you to sleep and he did this when dr. @entity12 was not around , " @entity106 said			1
@entity5 , desperate for sleep , then ingested a dose of propofol on his own , creating " a perfect storm that killed him instantly , " @entity106 said			2
" when dr. @entity12 came into the room and found @entity5 , there was no cpr , no paramedic , no machine that was going to revive @entity5 , " he said			1
" he died so rapidly , so instantly that he did n't have time to close his eyes , " @entity106 said			0
@entity106 told jurors that @entity12 was trying to wean @entity5 off propofol when @entity5 died			1
@entity5 was addicted to @entity131 , prescribed by another doctor , and his insomnia was at least in part related to that , according to @entity106			2
@entity5 's inability to sleep on the morning he died was " one of the insidious effects " of @entity131 addiction withdrawal , @entity106 said			1
since @entity12 did not know about the @entity131 , he could not understand why @entity5 was unable to fall asleep that morning , @entity106 said			1
@entity5 told @entity12 a day before he died that he needed to fall asleep in order to be able to rehearse for upcoming concerts , @entity106 said			2
" i have to sleep , i have to get some sleep			0
they will cancel my rehearsals			0
i will lose that performance , " @entity106 quoted @entity5 as saying			2
@entity106 said tuesday that he will challenge prosecution assertions that greed factored into @entity12 's treatment of @entity5			1
" if the prosecution is going to tell you he is greedy , callous and reckless , you need to hear the full story , " he told jurors , adding that @entity5 was the only celebrity @entity12 had ever met			1
@entity5 died june 25 , 2009			2
" just make me sleep			0
it does n't matter what time i get up , " @entity12 quoted @entity5 as telling him , according to a recording of a police interview played in court			2
he agreed to administer the drug and @entity5 fell asleep			2
after he left to go to the bathroom , he discovered @entity5 was no longer breathing			2
@entity23 argued @entity12 was not a specialist with anesthetics and misused the drug , which he said can suppress proper function of the heart and lungs			0
" it is not a sleep aid , it is not a sleep agent , " @entity23 told jurors			0
" it is a general anesthetic			0
" between april 6 , 2009 , and the time of @entity5 's death , @entity12 ordered enough propofol to give @entity5 1,937 milligrams a day , @entity23 said			1
@entity12 told police he gave the entertainer doses of propofol virtually every night for two months , according to a recording played in court			0
@entity12 also used a cheap instrument to monitor oxygen levels in @entity5 's blood , @entity23 said			1
the device was " utterly useless " unless @entity12 constantly monitored it because it lacked an alarm that would go off if @entity5 was not getting enough oxygen into his lungs , @entity23 said			2
@entity12 " repeatedly acted with gross negligence , repeatedly denied care , appropriate care , to his patient , @entity5 , and it was dr. @entity12 's repeated incompetent and unskilled acts that led to @entity5 's death , " @entity23 told jurors			1
prosecutors contend that @entity12 used a makeshift intravenous drip to administer propofol , a practice they argue violated the standard of care and led to the pop star 's death			1
but @entity106 said @entity12 did not use a makeshift intravenous drip to administer the drug			0
@entity106 added that an expert on propofol will testify that @entity12 was not responsible for @entity5 's death			1
@entity12 never told emergency responders or emergency room doctors trying to save @entity5 's life that the musician had been dosed with the propofol , @entity23 said			1
producer @entity214 , the first prosecution witness , said he was jolted by @entity5 's appearance when the latter arrived at a rehearsal , on june 19 , less than a week before he died			1
" he appeared lost and a little incoherent , " said @entity214			0
" i did not feel he was well			0
" @entity214 said he gave the pop singer food and wrapped him in a blanket to ward off chill			0
@entity5 watched the rehearsal and did not participate			2
@entity214 was helping @entity5 prepare for the " @entity224 " world tour scheduled for @entity22 's @entity223 in autumn 2009			2
in an e-mail written early june 20 , @entity214 wrote , in part , to @entity227 president @entity227 , " my concern is , now that we 've brought the doctor in to the fold and have played the tough love , now or never card , is that the artist may be unable to rise to the occasion due to real emotional stuff			0
he appeared quite week and fatigued this evening			0
he had a terrible case of the chills , was trembling , rambling and obsessing			0
everything in me says he should be psychologically evaluated			0
if we have any chance at all to get him back in the light			0
it 's going to take a strong therapist to ( get ) him through this as well as immediate physical nurturing			0
... tonight i was feeding him , wrapping him in blankets to warm his chills , massaging his feet to calm him and calling his doctor			0
" i believe that he really wants this ... it would shatter him , break his heart if we pulled the plug , " @entity214 wrote			0
" he 's terribly frightened it 's all going to go away			0
he asked me repeatedly tonight if i was going to leave him			0
he was practically begging for my confidence			0
he was like a lost boy			0
there still may be a chance he can rise to the occasion if get him the help he needs			0
" @entity227 was the concert promoter			0
@entity12 was unhappy that @entity5 did not rehearse and told @entity214 not to try to be the singer 's physician , @entity214 testified , adding @entity5 insisted the next day he was capable of doing the rehearsals			1
@entity5 was a full rehearsal participant in the days before he died , the producer said			2
@entity227 executive @entity272 testified that after the 50 @entity22 shows sold out instantly , there were still 250,000 buyers wanting tickets			0
@entity272 said he negotiated with @entity12 , at @entity5 's request , to work as the singer 's personal doctor			1
@entity12 initially asked for $ 5 million a year , explaining that he would have to close four clinics and lay off employees			1
@entity272 rejected that deal , but later offered him $ 150,000 a month , an amount recommended by @entity5			2
both @entity272 and @entity214 testified that @entity5 on many occasions appeared fully engaged and excited about the impending concerts			0
the trial has attracted widespread attention			0
on tuesday , a woman rushed toward @entity12 as he was walking to the courtroom , but she was stopped by three deputies guarding him			0
the woman said she just wanted to talk to @entity12			2
@entity5 's parents , brothers @entity294 , @entity295 and @entity227 , and sisters @entity297 , @entity298 and @entity299 filled a row in the courtroom for opening statements and the first witness tuesday			1
@entity5 's three children are not expected to attend the trial or testify , according to a source close to their grandmother , @entity308			1
@entity1 's @entity309 contributed to this report .			0
