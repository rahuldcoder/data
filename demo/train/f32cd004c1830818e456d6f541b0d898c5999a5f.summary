@entity0 -- @entity2 refers to the tattoos on his face as the " art of war " : an eye etched on his forehead , five stars down the left side of his face , and the words " do n't cry " on his eyelids			1
the tattoos are permanent reminders of his past life as a drug dealer			2
@entity2 got the tattoos , he said , to send a message to his enemies and the police to leave him alone			2
" i had to create a character that no one would dare challenge , " he said			0
but @entity2 's mother and his best friend feared for his safety			0
they staged an intervention and convinced him to make a fresh start			0
@entity2 stopped selling drugs and moved to @entity29			0
but with a criminal record and no connections , he had a difficult time finding a job			0
after a few months , he moved back to @entity0 , dejected			1
" i was at the lowest of my lows , " he said			0
he also was n't in contact with his two sons , which troubled him since his own father had n't been involved in his life			2
" i was confused , lost , and did n't have the slightest idea of how to be a good father , " said @entity2 , now 30			2
" i did n't have examples that could guide me			2
" @entity2 's outlook began to change , however , when he followed his mother 's advice and went to the @entity46 in @entity0			1
there , he 's gotten job training , life skills and support that have made him much more optimistic about his future			0
since 1999 , the center has helped thousands of @entity0 residents find jobs and enabled hundreds of fathers to become more responsible parents			1
" what we want to do is get these people above ground and back into the mainstream , " said @entity57 , the nonprofit 's founder and ceo			1
" we help them get them jobs so they can pay taxes and child support			0
" most men , like @entity2 , walk through the center 's doors because they need help finding a job			2
but @entity57 believes that jobs are just the first step			1
for him , the key to creating real change in @entity0 's troubled communities is ending what he calls " the cycle of father absence			1
" " if we do n't crack the code of men having babies for whom they 're not responsible for , all of our efforts to build a better @entity0 will be limited , " said @entity57 , 57			1
" we 're there to create a pathway to help them to understand how to begin to take on that responsibility			0
" according to the 2012 @entity94 just released by the @entity95 , more than 19 million children across the country -- 26 % -- are living without a father in the home			0
in @entity0 , among @entity100 children , the rate is 69 %			1
@entity57 says many of the men he tries to help grew up without fathers themselves			1
he also knows that children who grow up without fathers are more likely to become teen parents , use drugs and commit crimes , according to the @entity109			2
" the one thing that is consistent with all these men is that they want to be involved with the lives of their children , but they just do n't know how , " @entity57 said			1
his nonprofit runs a @entity119 program to give men the support and tools they need to become better parents and reverse the cycle			1
a large part of that is helping men with their financial responsibilities			2
@entity57 says you ca n't fix the problem of deadbeat dads unless you address that many of them are dead broke			1
in the four @entity0 zip codes where @entity57 ' nonprofit works , there are nearly 3,000 men who together owe more than $ 40 million in child support , according to the @entity140 @entity139			1
when @entity2 first came to the @entity46 , he owed $ 47,000 in child support			0
the size of this debt discouraged him from seeking employment , he said , because it usually only paid minimum wage and most of his wages would be garnished			0
but a counselor at the center helped @entity2 arrange a plan with @entity151 , which forgave more than $ 30,000 of his debt as long as he stayed employed			0
the center also helped @entity2 land a full - time job -- loading trucks on the overnight shift at a clothing warehouse -- so he could earn money while taking classes at @entity160			0
@entity2 , who now covers his tattoos with makeup every day , is six credits away from earning his associate 's degree in general studies			0
he plans to apply to more colleges soon to study pharmacology and molecular sciences			0
@entity57 ' program also teaches men that being a father is about more than finances			1
they are taught nurturing skills , such as how to change diapers and communicate with their kids			2
" you have a group of men speaking about issues they are having about their children , " @entity2 said			2
" that 's unheard of			0
men do n't do that , especially black men in the neighborhoods that we come from			1
" without these meetings , i would not know how to be a father			0
" @entity2 has now embraced his role as a dad			0
he recently filed for visitation rights with his eldest son , who is 10 years old , and he takes his younger son , age 3 , to school at least three times a week			0
" the first day i took him to school , i got the sense of fatherhood , " @entity2 said			0
" it has made me feel ( like ) more of a man			0
" @entity57 knows firsthand the struggles @entity2 endured and the satisfaction he feels from having turned his life around			1
it 's a transformation he experienced himself			0
@entity57 grew up in @entity0 and remembers the day his own father left , when he was 9 years old			1
as a teenager , @entity57 became a heroin and cocaine addict and spent 17 years selling drugs and committing petty crimes to support his habit , spending time in and out of jail			1
@entity57 said his biggest regret is that when he was 21 , he had a son who he did n't take responsibility for			1
in 1986 , after being charged with multiple drug - related offenses , @entity57 decided to turn his life around			1
he begged a residential rehabilitation program to let him into the program , and he persuaded the judge to let him complete the one - year rehab instead of going to jail			0
" i did n't want to go to jail anymore , " @entity57 said			1
" i was physically and psychologically tired and my conscience was bothering me			0
" @entity57 earned his associate 's degree at @entity160 , and he says he has n't looked back			1
he found a series of nonprofit jobs and was hired by the @entity0 @entity233 , eventually working on an initiative to improve maternal and child health			1
working there , in the early 1990s , it struck him that there were no programs for fathers			2
so in 1992 , @entity57 started the @entity242 at the @entity233 , and the experience led him to found his nonprofit seven years later			1
" it 's my way of giving back ... in ways in which i took from my community many years ago , " @entity57 said			1
now married , he 's raised two children with his wife and has been able to repair his relationship with his eldest son @entity250			0
today , they often go to baseball games together , along with @entity57 ' youngest son			1
@entity57 ' turnaround is an inspiration to @entity2 and the other men in his program			1
" when i learned @entity57 's story , ( it ) pretty much blew me away , " @entity2 said			1
" and look what he has obtained			0
" he 's more than a role model			0
" now @entity2 feels confident that he can follow @entity57 ' example			2
" @entity57 allowed me to find and restore my dignity , " he said			2
" that 's one of the greatest things that you can offer anyone			0
" " you ca n't become a better father without being a better man			2
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity271 website and see how to help .			0
