-- take some bills out of your wallet			0
what do you have ? i 've got a couple of @entity8 , some @entity9 and a @entity10			0
but now , the currency of the greatest nation on @entity13 will carry a scribble that has been variously described as curly fries , a phone cord , a bendy straw or simply the " @entity18 ! " sign from a comic strip			1
that 's the signature of @entity22 , president @entity23 's nominee for secretary of the treasury , and it has lit up the blogosphere			1
so instead of going crazy because the @entity27 is in sore need of a binder full of women , what the " boing " is going to do to our money is the big deal			0
i know a guy who is a great artist , and his signature is mainly a straight line interrupted by a bump in the middle , which could have been caused by someone accidentally hitting the table			0
but he is an artist and can do what he wants			0
i also know people who have had their 1040 tax returns rejected by the @entity46 for a boing - style signature			2
is it possible that our treasury secretary could have his tax returns go awry because of his penmanship ? could the @entity53 start rejecting the almighty dollar because they think the boing looks too weird ? or could his signature mean something else in @entity53 , like " we will bury you " or " this is monopoly money " ? @entity22 is a @entity62 - @entity61 , really smart type of guy , and @entity64 knows we probably owe him a lot			1
he 's been a good chief of staff in just keeping the birthers out of the @entity68 so @entity23 could govern			1
but please , mr. @entity22 , retire the boing			1
after all , " @entity22 " is only three letters long			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity73 .			0
