-- last april , images of @entity3 men dressed in drag started making the rounds on @entity6			1
the campaign , called @entity8 , featured men proudly swathed in the colorful garb traditional among @entity3 women			1
the subjects -- young , old , moustachioed , bespectacled -- were making a statement that was at once political and feminist , proving that in the @entity3 community , the two often go hand in hand			1
" you ca n't separate the two , " explains @entity17 , a @entity3 activist , journalist and a ph.d. student at the @entity20			1
" it 's a political move against the @entity25 regime , and the regime happens to be oppressive , to @entity27 and to women -- not just @entity3 women but all women			1
" the campaign , which received over 17,000 @entity6 " likes " , and , according to the site , the endorsement of @entity36 actress @entity35 , was the brainchild of two male feminists , @entity39 and @entity40			1
they launched the campaign after an @entity25 court in the @entity3 region of @entity45 sentenced a man convicted of domestic abuse to walk the streets dressed in women 's clothing			1
@entity39 donned a dress , had @entity40 snap the picture , and posted the image on @entity6 with the slogan , " being a woman is not a tool to humiliate or punish anyone			1
" " women are part of our personality , our character			2
if we oppress one part of our character , we oppress ourselves , " @entity39 said in an interview with the @entity64			1
" if one part of us is unfree , our whole can not be free , either			2
" that a male - led feminist movement could emerge is somewhat surprising given the region 's track record for women 's rights			2
@entity72 , the executive director for the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) , notes that honor killings , genital mutilation , and child marriages still make up a large part of the cultural landscape			1
" officials put the number of honor killings at a few hundred each year , but i think that shows just the tip of the iceberg			1
the realities are far darker , " she says			0
for the men involved in the campaign , however , women 's rights is an issue of obvious importance			2
" in my own experience , it seems the @entity3 people are trying really hard to fight for the rights that have been taken from them			1
i guess women 's rights is part of that whole thing , " says @entity97 , who says he did n't hesitate to put on a dress as part of the campaign			2
" i would n't label myself as a feminist , but i would say i 'm an activist who does anything possible to make the world a better place for every human , " he adds			0
" it might have something to do with my nationality , i suppose			0
" video : @entity115 girl , 11 , runs from marriage @entity17 argues there are many areas where @entity3 women enjoy more rights than their female brethren in neighboring countries			1
by law , 30 % of the @entity126 @entity125 parliament 's members must be women			0
the main @entity3 party in the @entity131 parliament has instituted a similar quota , requiring 40 % of the seats go to women			2
at the same time , women have also made up the backbone of many @entity3 separatist movements , including the @entity138 in @entity131 and the @entity139 in @entity140			2
" it 's like affirmative action , " says @entity17			0
" in many of the @entity138 camps , men do the domestic work so women can read books			0
" to a certain extent , notes @entity17 , it 's because women have been denied rights , both within the @entity3 community and by the government of the country in which they reside			1

' for her , she 's taking up arms against patriarchy and national oppression			0
it 's a secular revolution run by women who are the most oppressed in the world , " she says			0
though @entity72 agrees that women play a pivotal role in these groups , she argues that their presence is not necessarily feminist in nature			0
" i know lots of women in these movements , and though they 've been armed and are fighting shoulder - to - shoulder with men , they are just fighting as a nationalist group			0
women 's rights are not seriously part of their political agenda , " she says			0
@entity17 is not in agreement			0
" i genuinely believe that @entity27 women have reached the point of no return			0
even if the @entity27 people were given all their cultural rights , if men did n't share them equally with women , i think women would take up arms against them , " she jokes			0
correction : an earlier version of this article stated @entity17 visited the training camps of @entity138 members , which is not correct .			0
