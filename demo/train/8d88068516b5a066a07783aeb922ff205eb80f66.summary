-- call it a meteorological mystery : forecasters warned that there would be at least six @entity6 hurricanes this season , but so far we 've seen only one			1
it 's the first year in recent memory that every major hurricane forecast has busted after pointing to " above normal activity			1
" we are passing the season 's halfway point			1
normally , the @entity6 would see its first hurricane by august 10 , and a major hurricane ( @entity18 or higher ) by september 4			1
but this year is not normal			0
2013 's first hurricane -- @entity20 -- was a month late			1
it was so behind schedule it nearly set a record for tardiness			0
although the number of 2013 @entity6 storms is above average -- at nine so far -- the intensity of those storms has n't matched the forecasts			1
@entity20 -- a category 1 with winds under 95 mph -- ranked nowhere close to a major hurricane when it spun out harmlessly in the mid-atlantic			1
what 's going on here ? climate change ? @entity37 ? something else ? experts do n't have a full understanding , but three things are getting the blame : -- in the eastern @entity6 , where hurricanes are often born , @entity43 desert air is drying the moisture that hurricanes need to form			1
-- in the western @entity6 and @entity48 , fast horizontal winds have been cutting off the tops of potential hurricanes , sapping their power			1
-- experts speculate that dry air from @entity55 's drought may be another factor			1
@entity57 explains this strange hurricane season respected veteran hurricane scientist @entity59 of @entity60 has pretty much given up for this year			1
his research group predicted eight hurricanes this season			1
" the forecast up to now is a bust , " says @entity59			2
" the second half of the season will be more active , " he predicts , with as many as five more hurricanes			1
even with the most sophisticated prediction techniques , @entity59 says , " there 's still 40 or 50 % of variations in tropical storm and hurricane activity that we ca n't explain			1
" poking fun at his government rivals , @entity59 jokes about " reports of a suicide watch " among the meteorologists who worked on this year 's @entity82 forecast			2
nonetheless , the feds are standing firm			0
unlike @entity59 , they 're not ready to cry uncle			0
" our forecast remains the same , " weather service spokesman @entity86 said			1
" we 're sticking by it			0
" the @entity82 -- last may -- initially forecast 13 to 20 " named storms , " including seven to 11 hurricanes			1
then in august , it dialed down that initial forecast to predict 13 to 19 named storms , including six to nine hurricanes			1
so far , including @entity20 , we 've seen nine named storms			1
from the weather service 's perspective , that statistic shows its forecast remains valid			1
" in some ways we 're ahead of schedule , " says @entity86			0
" and in late september and october there 's plenty of time for the number of tropical storms and hurricanes to climb			1
" according to the weather service forecast , at least four more tropical storms or hurricanes will form in the next 11 weeks			1
that 's 77 days , or one storm forming every 19 days			0
it would be a mistake to believe that the second half of any hurricane season would resemble the first half , says @entity86 , who stresses that we 're not experiencing a " lull			1
" " historically speaking , june and july and the first part of august are typically fairly quiet , " he says			0
september , he warns , is the time when storms can start to get get serious			2
some key examples : - @entity126 hit the eastern @entity127 in september 1985			2
- in 1938 a disastrous hurricane tore up parts of the northeast , also during the month of september			2
- in 1998 one of the deadliest storms on record , @entity133 , raked the @entity134 and @entity135 after forming in late october			2
- @entity136 , which altered so many lives last year when it slammed into much of the @entity140 , did n't appear until october			2
- although @entity142 devastated @entity143 in late august , it was the first hurricane of 1992 , a season that overall turned out to be below normal			1
- in 2002 , @entity145 , the first hurricane of the season , did n't occur until september			1
weeks later in early october , @entity147 made a destructive landfall along the @entity150 coast			0
there 's also always the possibility of a freak storm after the season ends , says @entity86			2
" nature sometimes throws us a curve ball as it has in the past when we 've seen storms develop in the month of december			2
" how likely is it that the weather service forecast will pan out ? in this crazy year , it 's anybody 's guess			1
@entity165 watchers point out that there are more signs that something may be amiss : -- the @entity170 index -- a rating system that compares the intensity of storm seasons -- would normally be around 55 for the @entity6			1
it 's now a paltry 16			0
globally the rating is a stunning 255 , roughly half of what we should see this time of year			0
-- when an ocean basin kicks up a fuss on one part of the globe , usually another ocean basin is quiet			0
nature tends to balance itself that way			0
this year , according to the ratings , storm activity in all the world 's ocean basins is below normal			0
this adds even more to the mystery			0
-- this year there is no @entity37 , which would keep the season quiet , or @entity194 , which would fuel a more active season			2
@entity6 surface temperatures continue to be above normal , which also would help stir up storms			1
-- climate change ? as you might expect , opinions differ			0
some researchers say global warming from the buildup of @entity206 carbon gas pollution in the atmosphere will lead to more frequent and more powerful hurricanes			0
some studies support that hypothesis , while others are less convinced			0
although scientists are 95 % sure that @entity206 is warming the globe , they 're not certain about how that affects hurricanes			0
" there are mixed signals , " says @entity86			0
" so the jury 's still out and research is ongoing			0
" related : silent hurricane season fuels debate over global warming at the @entity223 in @entity224 , they 're comparing this year to " a slow first half of a slow football game , " says hurricane center spokesman @entity227			2
" it really does n't matter how many storms form out there , " @entity227 says			2
" if one gets to you , it 's a bad year			0
" the news media is n't making too much of this strange season , he says			2
but he warns , do n't be fooled by it			0
the mystery has grabbed the attention of @entity59 and other scientists , who are looking forward to analyzing all the data			0
who knows ? we may learn a few things			0
" we 'll figure it out , " says @entity59			0
" let 's see what the rest of the season brings			0
" @entity0 meteorologist @entity57 and producer @entity250 contributed to this report .			0

number of 2013 @entity6 storms is above average , but intensity has n't matched forecasts
halfway into season , @entity6 has only seen one hurricane -- a weak one named @entity20
weather service stands by forecast for 13 " named storms , " including 6 hurricanes
experts were surprised by hurricane - killing dry @entity43 air and high @entity48 winds
