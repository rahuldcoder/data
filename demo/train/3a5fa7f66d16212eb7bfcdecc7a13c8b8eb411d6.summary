-- they may be famous , but even the world 's biggest names go weak at the knees for their favorite football team			1
@entity6 talks to tennis legend @entity7 about his true number one passion : @entity11 giants @entity10			1
why do you support @entity10 ? i am a big fan of @entity10 and have been for years			1
i 've actually been on the advisory board for ten years			1
every @entity11 kid , before they walk and before they can talk , they love their football			1
it is similar story for me			2
before i was a tennis player i was a football player [ and supporter ]			1
so you can say that your first love was football ? football is as much of a love as tennis			1
of all the players who have played for @entity10 down the years , which have stood out the most ? we 'll have to start with " @entity31 " , @entity31			1
he was obviously the captain of the team , and a @entity35 winner , but he also won lots of national and international awards			2
so he was the standout			2
but you also had @entity39 , @entity40 , many superstars			2
until now it was the most prominent club in the country			0
since the 1970s it was the most successful , the richest and had the biggest fan base			1
@entity46 is the club you want to root for			0
@entity10 had a tricky season last season , losing out to @entity49 for the title			1
are you optimistic for this season ? true , @entity49 had an incredible run , but we call this a bad season because we finished second			2
you can imagine the standards here			0
this year it is not much easier with a new coach @entity58			0
we 've not had the greatest of starts but we have got a new @entity62 player , [ former @entity65 and @entity66 winger @entity64 ] @entity63 , who i think is going to make all the difference in the world			0
can @entity10 recover from this season 's slow start under @entity58 ? if you were manager of @entity10 at the moment would you change anything ? i would be a little worried about the defence			1
we let , in my opinion , one of the best defensive players we have ever had go , [ @entity78 international ] @entity77 , who went to @entity80			0
i do n't know why or what happened but i do n't think we are as strong defensively as we are offensively			2
we have to score at least three goals to win now ! you travel around the world a lot and have a lot of commitments due to your tennis			2
how do you keep up with @entity10 and how does your fan nature come out in your life ? we are living in the world of technology , the internet and the media			1
so it 's particularly easy to keep up with the latest gossip and the results			0
but i am still quite often in @entity46 and i watch the club and talk to the players			0
do you have a favorite piece of memorabilia ? i have the shirt and go as often as i can			0
i was part of their heart breaking loss against @entity105 united in @entity106 in the @entity107 [ final ]			0
i was in the stadium and after i was with the players crying together			0
then i was in @entity80 two years later and we won in the penalty shoot out against @entity113 and i was celebrating with them afterwards			0
those were my two most memorable moments .			0
