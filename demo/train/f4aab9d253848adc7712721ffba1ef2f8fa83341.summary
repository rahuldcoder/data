-- " @entity3 , " it 's time for your curtain call			1
the addictive @entity6 series , which concluded last september , is expected to be one of the major frontrunners when the nominations are announced thursday for the 66th @entity10			1
its final half - season , which earned both big ratings and critical plaudits , is just about guaranteed to earn the show another nomination for best drama -- and that 's only the start			1
star @entity20 , who already has four emmy wins for the show , should easily nab another nod			1
co-star @entity24 should get one as well			0
altogether , the drama that turned " mr. chips into @entity29 , " in the description of creator @entity27 , should make out quite well			0
" remember my name , " indeed			0
but it may face some stiff competition , especially since both the drama and comedy series categories have been expanded up to seven nominees this year			0
here are some other @entity38 storylines to pay attention to : 1			0
" true detective " is on the case			0
the praise for the " @entity3 " finale had barely started to die down when @entity46 's " true detective " zipped into the zeitgeist			1
the first season , which starred @entity51 and @entity52 as two @entity54 homicide detectives -- one of them given to existential flights of fancy about life , the universe and nothingness -- may have actually helped win @entity51 an @entity60			1
emmy voters have no doubt paid attention			2
if last year 's eight nominations for " @entity67 " were n't enough , this year will likely bring more honors for the @entity70 - set drama and its machiavellian characters			1
moreover , the first season of " @entity75 " -- which narrowly missed qualifying for last year 's @entity10 -- is probably going to be in the thick of the comedy races , along with " @entity74 , " " @entity76 , " " @entity77 " and " @entity78			1
" ( " @entity75 's " second season , which was released on june 6 , will qualify for next year 's awards			1
@entity46 's " @entity87 " might not be able to find a slot among the comedy series nominees , since there are more than enough viable candidates			2
but the late actor @entity88 , who played the eccentric investor @entity90 in the show , might earn a nomination for his standout supporting work ( if that 's not an oxymoron )			2
similarly , @entity102 's " @entity101 " had an up - and - down season , with its surprise @entity98 win contrasting with mediocre ratings and uneven scripts			1
that may not be enough to get it a best comedy series nomination			0
but the show does benefit from some great supporting characters , including @entity109 as capt. @entity110 and @entity111 as @entity112 , aka " the @entity113 of people			0
remember " @entity115 " ! last year the @entity116 ( commonly known as " the @entity117 " ) was inflamed by the lack of attention paid to " @entity115 , " the thrilling @entity121 series that stars @entity122 as several mysterious clones			1
@entity38 probably wo n't have to be prompted twice ; the most recent season of " orphan " got plenty of exposure and @entity122 's face has been everywhere			1
the @entity4 10 : @entity122 and more fresh faces to watch in 2014 5			2
every year @entity46 -- which , it should be noted , is a unit of @entity132 , as is @entity4 -- earns a bunch of nominations for one or more of its made - for - @entity46 movies and miniseries			2
last year it was " @entity137			0
" previous years have showered nominations on " @entity139 , " " @entity140 , " " @entity141 , " " @entity142 " and " @entity143			2
" this year , look to " @entity144 , " the film version of @entity147 's wrenching play about @entity148 , to be among the leaders for total nominations , with stars @entity151 and @entity153 leading the way			1
with the movie category being separated from miniseries for the first time this year , look for shows like " @entity159 " and " @entity160 " to be recognized -- and have a shot of winning now			0
even with more nominees being named this year , the race for lead actress in a drama looks to be the most competitive			0
this is a good thing because there are standout performances from every corner of television			0
emmy favorites like @entity173 ( " homeland " ) , @entity174 ( " scandal " ) , @entity175 ( " @entity67 " ) , @entity176 ( " @entity180 " ) and @entity177 ( " @entity181 " ) could be upset by newcomers including the aforementioned @entity183 , @entity184 ( " @entity187 " ) , @entity185 ( " @entity188 " ) or @entity186 ( " the @entity189 " )			0
tell us , which actors and shows do you want to see honored by the @entity10 tomorrow ? fun facts about the @entity10 @entity195 to host @entity10			0

emmy nominations will be announced on july 10
" @entity3 " expected to do very well ; last season was *widely* hailed and watched
" @entity75 's " first season qualifies , will likely score nods
will there be room for " @entity115 " this time ?
