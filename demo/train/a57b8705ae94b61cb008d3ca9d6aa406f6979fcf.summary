-- @entity2 captain @entity1 is used to the huge pressure soccer can bring after a long career competing for major honors on the domestic and international stage			1
the midfielder has won four league titles in @entity2 , three while at @entity9 , and can boast two @entity11 successes and two @entity12 's with current club @entity13			1
yet there is one thing missing from @entity1 's impressive cv : success with his national team			1
the 33 - year - old was in the @entity21 team beaten to the trophy by @entity23 at the 2002 @entity24 in @entity25 and @entity26 , then on home soil in 2006 his side were knocked out in the semifinals by eventual winners @entity31			1
@entity1 also skippered @entity2 to second place at the @entity33 in 2008 , losing 1 - 0 to @entity34 in the final			1
but , as he told @entity37 's @entity36 , he is hoping to lead his side to glory in @entity40 in what will be his last @entity24			1
@entity0 : there have been so many great @entity21 footballers down the years , it must be hard when you become first of all an international , and then captain of your country			2
it 's not the same as being captain of a smaller country -- @entity2 has such a record , do you feel that extra weight and pressure ? @entity1 : to be honest it 's not a pressure , it 's an honor to be captain of @entity2 and when i became it in 2004 i was really proud that i could make the step to be captain after @entity62			1
there were so many good captains during the years , we have such a great history in the country and to be part of this makes me proud			2
also it 's pressure because you have to have success , you have to win games , you have to win titles and that 's what it 's all about in our country because it has a great history			2
hopefully we can carry on			0
@entity0 : does it make you laugh , you play your football in @entity81 now and we 're always up in arms if @entity81 make it to a quarterfinal or a semifinal , and @entity2 seem to make it to the final every time			1
@entity1 : not every time , but most of the time we can do it			1
a lot of people in @entity81 ask me how can you do this with your country because sometimes we go into a tournament and we are not the favorites but we can always do well , and that 's a quality we have			1
i do n't know where it comes from , maybe the history , but we can be really concentrated during the tournament , and especially in the big events most of the time we 've done really well			2
@entity0 : you 're coming up to your third @entity24 , how has the experience in 2002 and 2006 affected how you will approach the next one ? @entity1 : experience is always important			1
i played in 2002 and 2006 , once i finished second , once i finished third , so one place improvement maybe			0
when we get into a tournament it 's always step by step , we have to think from round to round			2
obviously it 's the last one i will play so it gives me big , big motivation to play a good tournament this year			2
i think it 's a bit similar to the past that when we go in the tournament we have a good team			2
we played a good qualification , but we are not one of the top favorites so maybe it plays a little into our hands			0
we have quite a young team , and if there is not too much pressure on the team maybe it will help the team a little bit			0
@entity0 : you 've had two great honors now , or you will have			0
you 've had playing a @entity24 on home soil in @entity2 and we 're coming up to the first @entity24 to ever be held in @entity40 -- you 've been lucky with how your career 's been timed			1
@entity1 : yeah , absolutely			1
to play a @entity24 in your own country as a captain is not normal			1
when we saw the draw in 2001 or 2002 that we had the @entity24 in 2006 we were all really excited because it was a big chance to play a @entity24 in your own country			1
if i look back , it was a great tournament for us , it was a great few weeks			0
everybody was so excited in the country , big parties all over the cities and now it 's a different thing			0
it 's the first @entity24 in @entity40 , it 's a little bit new for everybody			1
@entity2 was so well - organized , everybody expects the same now , but it 's a totally different thing now			1
the fans have a different mentality , it will be a lot different but in a good way hopefully			0
that 's why i think everybody is looking forward to it			0
@entity0 : what do you make of your group opponents ? @entity1 : we have a tough group			2
@entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 , they 're all really physical teams			0
so it will be really tough for us			0
@entity0 : you 're on 98 caps , assuming @entity2 do well in the @entity24 you 'll be well over the 100 mark and really among some of the top players that have ever played for @entity2			1
i think no - one 's going to catch @entity177 , who has 150 , are they ? but is that important to you , how you 're remembered in the history of your country 's players ? @entity1 : it 's always nice if you can be part of the history and well - recognized			1
i mean that 's what everybody wants , but the most important thing for me is that i 'm happy with myself			0
when i finish my career i can say i did well , i gave my best , and if a few more caps come it makes me happy			0
there 's not really a target , 100 is a big number and hopefully i can reach them soon			2
what comes after i will see			0
i 've really enjoyed the times i 've played for @entity2 , every game is special for me , so hopefully i can play a few more			2
@entity0 : i asked everyone in the office , i said @entity1 has played 98 times , how many goals do you think he has scored for @entity2 , and they all said 10 , 15 , 18 and i said 42			1
they could n't believe it			0
why is your strike rate so good for your country ? @entity1 : i do n't know 100 percent , but i was always a midfield player with a lot of determination in the box			1
i want to score goals			0
i always scored a lot of goals when i was young , i 've scored in every position in my career , from a defender to a striker when i was young			0
i think i learned it when i was young , i had it in the blood a little bit to score goals			0
that 's what i always try to do for my country and i 'm really proud that i could score so many goals			0
@entity0 : is the @entity24 still the biggest tournament for players ? @entity1 : i think so			1
you play for your club every year , week in week out , so it makes it exciting and special , but the @entity24 is something bigger			2
you play it every four years , the best teams in the world playing each other			0
even the atmosphere during such a big tournament , you go in the bus driving to a game and you see all your fans supporting you			0
they feel so excited even you feel something special .			0
