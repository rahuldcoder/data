-- it 's a new idea which could resonate with communities across the developing world -- a biomass stove which also generates electricity using sound waves			1
the score - stove is a cooker , fridge and energy generator in one which harnesses waste heat from cooking to power a specially designed thermo - acoustic engine , helping provide energy to areas where access to electricity is limited			1
the project is being led by the @entity20 's @entity19 , but has drawn on the expertise of partners around the world including the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) in @entity24			1
@entity23 researchers @entity25 and @entity27 demonstrated the first - ever thermo - acoustic engine in 1999 , adapting the principles originally outlined by @entity31 engineer @entity30 in the 19th century			1
in @entity30 's thermodynamic engine ( patented in 1816 ) air or gas is alternately heated from an external source and cooled			0
the expansion and contraction of the air drives displacer pistons in the @entity40 , but in @entity7 's thermo - acoustic set - up there are no moving parts , says @entity44 , score project director			1
the stove heats a specially shaped pipe at one end while the other end is cooled , @entity44 explains , compressing air inside the pipe and causing it to vibrate and produce powerful sound waves			1
" you can think of it as a big microphone or a loudspeaker working backwards			0
in fact we are using loudspeakers ( which act as a linear alternator ) in some of the rigs turning the sound into electricity , " @entity44 said			2
" it 's in excess of 170 decibels -- that 's more than the @entity66 taking off -- but it 's whisper quiet outside the pipe , " he added			0
@entity44 and colleagues at @entity70 have producing 36 watts of electricity under laboratory conditions and recently started installing and testing stoves in @entity74 and @entity75			1
" we must adapt the lab version for each area , taking into account local biomass fuels , types of pots and pans used to cook , along with the everyday tasks the unit will be required for , " @entity44 said			2
in the 2011 @entity86 , the @entity85 ( @entity85 ) reported that around 1.3 billion people presently have no access to electricity with 95 % of this number living in @entity91 or developing @entity92			2
even small amounts of electricity ( @entity7 's aim is to achieve an output of around 150 watts ) could transform the lives of rural communities providing light and charging facilities for a booming cell phone market			2
according to the @entity102 -- an association representing mobile phone operators worldwide -- over 70 % of @entity91 's one billion population will own a cell phone by the end of 2012			0
the @entity7 also makes cooking more efficient helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limiting exposure to cooking smoke			0
nearly three billion people still rely on biomass stoves which cause around two million premature deaths annually , according to the @entity113			0
making score - stoves in large numbers would currently cost around $ 250 per unit , @entity44 says , but a target of around $ 30 in the future is realistic			1
" that 's the next stage of the research			0
we hope to be making this in the millions			0
we are talking to several large manufacturers who are evaluating the product at the moment , " he said			0
" i am convinced that a wood - burning stove that can also generate electricity will benefit these ( three billion ) people			2

new *multi-purpose* biomass stove generates electricity from sound waves created by cooking
