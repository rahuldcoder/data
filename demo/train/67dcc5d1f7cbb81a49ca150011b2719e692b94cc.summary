-- @entity1 delights in doing things differently			1
he 's credited with inventing over 1,800 recipes for his restaurant @entity5 -- consistently rated the world 's best -- and elevating cooking to a new level , fusing gastronomy with art and science			1
" one of the big reasons why @entity5 is where it is , is because we talk to other disciplines			1
we are seeing the revolution of communications in cooking , " he says			2
@entity1 has become something of a culinary superstar who has given lectures across the world on his innovative approach to food and his face has been splashed on the cover of international publications			1
" everything that has happened is a gift , " he says			2
" when i was on the cover of the @entity33 i could n't believe it			0
what is a cook doing there ? i have been invited to @entity38 as a visiting professor ! how could i have dreamed of this ? i never expected this			0
" it 's a long way from where he imagined he would be when he took his first job in a restaurant kitchen aged 17			1
that was more to do with a teenage need to fund a summer vacation rather than the makings of a life 's vocation			1
@entity1 's interest in cooking began at home in @entity56 with his parents and younger brother @entity59 , but then becoming a footballer was of greater interest to the young @entity1			1
" neither @entity59 nor i studied cooking			0
neither of us wanted to be cooks			0
so we have the same way of thinking			0
we ask why about things , " @entity1 says			1
yet by the time @entity1 was 24 he was the head chef at @entity5 on the @entity69 coast in northeastern @entity70 , at that time a struggling restaurant in danger of losing its @entity73			1
today @entity5 is the benchmark for the world 's greatest culinary experience			1
only 8,000 people are served there each year despite millions of requests for a table			0
dining is less about enjoying a meal as indulging in an experience that can take a whole day			0
the average cost is $ 400 , involving dishes prepared with almost molecular precision			2
" you do n't make money with avant garde cuisine			1
this is not a business			0
we could auction reservations on @entity94			0
but that would be prostitution , " says @entity1			1
it seems fitting that the creations emanating from his kitchen should be less than 10 miles from the former home of artist , @entity103			0
from " pina colada pillow " cocktails to extracting the unique flavor of prawn heads , his kitchen team provide the unexpected in a way the surrealist would likely have approved of			0
" every time i meet something i did not know existed i say , ' @entity115 to meet you , ' because it extended my idea of what life is about and that is what @entity1 is doing , " says @entity121 , former curator of @entity123 's @entity122			1
" art or not art ? i do n't care but certainly this is an experience that takes me into other realms			0
" @entity1 also has his attention fixed on venturing into new territory			2
last year he announced that @entity5 would close its doors for good in the summer of 2011			1
in its place will come the @entity136 , a " think tank of gastronomic creativity " that @entity1 will continue to hone until it opens in 2014			1
" this could become a vast creative network , thousands of people bringing in ideas			0
it is going to change the relationship between creativity and society , " @entity1 says			2
" this is a lot more than a cooking project			0
it 's a social project			2
the objective of the foundation is to continue creating and to share everything via @entity153			0
" @entity1 's interest in connecting with a larger world has already seen him partner with technology and communications company @entity159 in @entity70 to help develop @entity136 's it			1
but he 's also gone back to his roots , embarking on smaller projects including a tapas and cocktail bar in @entity56 with his brother			2
the tapas bar tickets will open later this @entity168 , while 41 @entity169 is bringing a range of cocktails to @entity56 's bar scene			2
" we needed a place in @entity56 for friends			0
a place like this is much more relaxed than @entity5 , " @entity1 says of 41 degrees			1
" there will be tapas for 5 or 6 euros ( $ 6.7 to $ 8 )			0
it is not the same			0
the pressure is very different			0
" " the easy option for me was to just stop			2
but when you see how people react ( to @entity5 ) you realize it 's worth ( pursuing a new venture ) .			1
