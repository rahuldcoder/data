@entity0 -- you would n't know the punk band was @entity4 , a culture self - programmed for propriety			2
i ca n't write the chorus ( sung in @entity9 ) of the band 's favorite song here , as my editor would first delete the offensive word and then report me to my superiors			2
let 's just say it 's an obscenity that begins with the letter " f " and rhymes with what hockey players call the vulcanized rubber disk that 's hit into the goal			2
the four - piece band screams the word over and over again to a @entity25 tune , " @entity30 , " directed at the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) , operator of the crippled @entity29 nuclear plant			1
if you have n't guessed it yet this band -- known as the @entity34 -- is angry with @entity26 for a reason			1
each member of the group was affected by the meltdown at the plant in northeastern @entity4 that followed last year 's earthquake and tsunami			1
why @entity29 will remain a threat lead singer and lyrics writer , @entity43 , lived in @entity46 , just a few miles away from the plant			1
he was evacuated as the plant leaked radiation across a swath of northern @entity4			2
he is one of the 78,000 residents who have been unable to return to a 12.4 - mile ( 20 - km ) exclusion zone around the plant , now a nuclear wasteland			1
the song is also about loss and sadness , said @entity43			0
" my family far apart , looks up at the same sky , shattered by earthquake and betrayal			0
there is no such thing as the truth , " said @entity43 , sharing the lyrics of the song			0
@entity43 lost his home and all of his possessions			0
he has essentially lost his job because the company he worked with is based inside the evacuation zone			2
" i ca n't go home , " he said			0
" i want to tell people the pain , sadness and isolation i feel because i ca n't go home			0
" a year after the disaster , @entity43 's story is one shared by many of the evacuees from the world 's worst nuclear disaster in 25 years			1
like @entity43 , all are uncertain about whether they will ever return home to their land and possessions			0
most continue to seek refuge with friends and extended family members			0
during a recent visit to the @entity29 plant , the manager of the disaster spoke to reporters about the possibility of evacuees being allowed home			1
@entity95 , no relation to @entity43 , said the return date remained " uncertain , " and that @entity26 would continue to do its best in conjunction with the government to help the residents return			1
the plant manager said some residents south of the nuclear plant might be able to return this spring			1
@entity105 , @entity43 's hometown , sits to the north			0
@entity105 is one of the more contaminated regions in the evacuation zone			0
frustrated by the slow clean - up , @entity43 says singing is his outlet			0
it 's also his reminder to anyone who is willing to listen that the nuclear nightmare continues a year after the reactor buildings exploded .			1
