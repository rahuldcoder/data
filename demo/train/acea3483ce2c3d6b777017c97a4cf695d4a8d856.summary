-- announcement of a @entity3 handheld console is causing a collective " eh " among fans of the pioneering gaming company			1
the new console hopes to entice the entry - level gamer ( i.e. kids ) with a large catalog of games designed for the @entity11 and @entity12 while appealing to parents with a low price point ( $ 129 )			2
unlike its counterpart , the @entity3 does not have @entity17 visual effects , nor can it be folded shut like other @entity12 handheld consoles			1
instead , the @entity3 remains flat and fixed , much like a tablet			1
the controls are similar to other @entity23 handheld consoles and screen sizes are the same as the @entity26			1
while critics are split over whether this is a good idea for the company in the long term , fans in forums and social media are shaking their heads			0
some are asking why a @entity3 model is needed when @entity17 can be turned off on the current console , while others are calling for @entity23 executives ' heads			1
much of the confusion lies in the naming convention			0
while the @entity12 can only play @entity12 games , the @entity3 and @entity11 can play games designed for the ds or the @entity11			2
the problem arises because the games are clearly labeled for the @entity12 or the @entity11 , but not for the @entity3 , and could have parents wondering , " where are the @entity3 games ? " it was a similar problem when the @entity50 was announced and players could n't play @entity50 on @entity50 systems			2
the names were n't distinct enough to create separation for a casual audience			0
the move to a non3 - @entity17 environment for the handheld console is a welcome one to some fans			1
" oh i 'm so happy they 're creating a @entity3 , " said @ omglazerkittens on @entity61			2
" that 's the whole reason i have n't bought one yet			0
" @entity23 , for its part , has said the new device is designed for young kids , despite having promotional videos with adults using it			1
despite the nonplussed reaction from many older gamers , some fans understand the need for a device aimed at the young audience			1
the new console may appeal to " parents who want to buy their kids pokÃ © mon and a @entity11 at an affordable price , " wrote @entity83 , a member of popular online video - gaming forum @entity85			2
" plus , the flat design kind of reminds me of a tablet			0
i would n't be surprised if this is @entity23 's way of directly competing with that market for small kids			1
" the october 12 release for the @entity3 is the same day the company plans to launch the latest titles in the @entity95 universe , " @entity96 " and " @entity96 " but other gamers are n't so quick to accept the need for the new console or @entity23 's explanation			1
" to those who say the @entity3 is a kid - friendly option , where does the inability to protect the screen with folding fall into that ? " wrote @ @entity102 on @entity61			0
twitter user @ kellyherron27 wonders whether @entity23 is not happy with the @entity109 anymore			0
" feels like they 're saying , ' ok , so our novelty really is a gimmick			0
' " but in explaining the need for the @entity3 , another @entity85 member may have offered the most clear - eyed assessment			0
" parents will be buying this for kids and that 's the point , hence the price , " wrote @entity117			0
" they 're aiming at kids wanting the new @entity124 game and if parents can get it cheap , it 'll sell over a more expensive @entity11 model			0
" " this console is n't aimed at any of us ( adults )			2

many gamers appear less than *excited* about @entity23 's *forthcoming* @entity3 console
the handheld device does not have @entity17 visual effects and is shaped like a small tablet
console may be aimed at kids , not adults
