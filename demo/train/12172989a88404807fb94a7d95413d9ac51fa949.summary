on a day when president @entity0 trumpeted support of strengthening equal pay laws , a question about pay disparity between male and female staffers within the @entity6 seemed to catch the administration a bit off guard			1
special coverage : 2014 midterm elections an analysis by the conservative @entity13 found that women staffers made about 88 cents on the dollar , compared with male staffers			0
female federal workers in the early years of the @entity0 administration had a median salary of nearly 93 % of what their male colleagues earn , according to 2011 figures from the @entity23 , an agency that works to protect the rights of federal employees			2
and while that figure for female federal worker earnings was up from just over 83 percent in 1991 , it does n't exactly match the type of pay parity the @entity6 was touting			1
" what i can tell you is that we have , as an institution here , have aggressively addressed this challenge , and obviously , though , at the 88 cents that you cite , that is not a hundred , but it is better than the national average , " @entity6 spokesman @entity31 told reporters monday			1
" and when it comes to the bottom line that women who do the same work as men have to be paid the same , there is no question that that is happening here at the @entity6 at every level			1
" @entity0 strengthens equal pay protections two deputy chiefs of staff in the @entity6 - one male and one female - @entity31 said , make the same salary			1
@entity31 's correct , women 's studies scholars say			2
the @entity6 and federal government 's rates of pay parity are better than the national average of " 77 cents for every dollar a man earns , " figure the president noted in his @entity66 address			1
equal pay : 5 things you need to know however , the fact that even an administration that prides itself on having made its first priority signing the @entity73 into law , has n't achieved equal pay for equal work demonstrates the complexity in reaching complete parity , said @entity79 , director of @entity80 at @entity81			1
" there 's also a lot of misinformation out there , " @entity79 said			0
" i do n't think most people understand the dynamics of it and the complications involved			0
most people believe there should be pay parity but they separate the process from the outcome			1
" @entity95 highlight equal pay in political push those dynamics include child rearing roles , age , education , race , ethnicity and even where someone lives			0
for instance , a woman might find her earnings decreased if she temporarily left the workforce to raise a young child and an @entity110 or @entity111 woman is more likely to earn less than her white female counterpart			0
for example , " among women , median weekly earnings for mothers of children under age 18 were $ 680 , slightly below the earnings for women without children under 18 ( $ 697 ) , " according to the @entity122 ' highlights of women 's earnings in 2012 report			2
" among men , earnings for fathers with children under 18 were $ 946 , compared with $ 799 for men without children under 18			0
" the gap has closed somewhat for millennial workers			0
" among younger workers , the earnings differences between women and men were not as great , " the @entity122 notes			1
" among workers who were 25 to 34 years old , women earned 90 percent of what men earned ; among 16 - to 24 - year - olds , women earned 89 percent as much as men			2
" the @entity73 the president signed in 2009 gave women more time to sue for pay discrimination			0
on monday , @entity0 signed executive orders that encourage federal contractors to make pay information more transparent , so women and minorities will know if they are being treated equally			0
as for getting to pay parity within the @entity6 and across the federal government -- well , that might take a while			1
" it 's not parity , " @entity79 said			0
" but it 's closer than what we see elsewhere which suggests a move in the right direction			0
" opinion : equal pay or opportunity for outrage ? opinion : in the real world , women still make less than men @entity95 seize on equal pay as a midterm issue @entity0 , @entity168 equal on gender pay inequality			2

@entity6 , agencies do n't have pay parity for both genders
the figures for the government are better than national figures for men and women on pay
addressing pay parity is complicated , say scholars and the @entity122
younger workers ' pay seems to *reflect* closer parity
