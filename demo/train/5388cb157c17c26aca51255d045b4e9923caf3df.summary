-- the rituals of college -- making new friends , studying until dawn , excessive partying -- can stress out any young adult			2
but students with bipolar disorder , or those at risk for the condition , are even more vulnerable in a college environment			1
academic pressures , social concerns , and sleep disruptions can lead to bouts of depression as well as mania , the euphoric , revved - up state characteristic of bipolar disorder			1
without the right treatment and support , bipolar college students face higher dropout rates , drug and alcohol abuse , and even suicide			1
" the new structure and new stresses for [ bipolar ] students who leave home to go to school sometimes can trigger problems and relapses , " says dr. @entity27 , @entity28 , the chief of mental health services at @entity30 and the author of " @entity32 : the @entity40 and @entity41 to do about it			1
" @entity0 : 5 relapse triggers to watch for these stresses , he adds , can also trigger mania in students who have an underlying vulnerability to bipolar disorder			1
" oftentimes , the first manic episode occurs in college , " @entity27 says			2
at its most severe , bipolar disorder is a dangerous condition that can lead to psychotic episodes and hospitalization			1
@entity58 forms of the disorder can cause problems as well , and can interfere with academic success			1
a 2006 study in the @entity63 compared a group of bipolar adults with a group of healthy adults who had similar iqs and social backgrounds			1
more than 60 percent of both groups entered college , but their achievements differed greatly : nearly half of the control group received a college degree , compared to just 16 percent of the bipolar group			1
students with bipolar disorder can survive -- and even thrive -- in college , but doing so requires a plan			1
taking the proper medications , arranging for the appropriate counseling and medical care on campus , avoiding drugs and alcohol , maintaining a steady sleep and study schedule , and finding sources of peer support are all crucial and can make the difference between achieving your goals and dropping out			2
@entity0 : 9 strategies for controlling bipolar disorder a breeding ground for bipolar symptoms @entity96 , 24 , was diagnosed with bipolar disorder during her senior year of high school in @entity99 , @entity100 , but it was n't until she left the support of her family and went away to college that the disease threatened her life			1
during the first weeks of her freshman year , she felt isolated and alone			0
she quit the soccer team and stopped going to classes			0
she started to stockpile medications and alcohol			0
in october , she drove to a nearby apple orchard , downed the pills and alcohol , and passed out			0
she woke up in the hospital after spending three days in a coma			0
( a passerby had seen her taillights , found her unconscious , and rushed her to the hospital , where she was medevaced to a larger hospital			0
) @entity96 says she remembers being angry to be alive			0
" i kept telling my family and friends that i was ok , but i was planning my suicide , " says @entity96 , who later returned to the @entity120 , @entity121			0
" i had so much support back home -- and then , in this new place , i did n't even know where the counseling center was			2
" numerous aspects of college life can trigger a manic or depressive episode			2
sleep deprivation and the keeping of irregular hours -- both common practices on college campuses -- are known to trigger mania , while binge drinking and the use of substances such as marijuana can cause depression			1
@entity0 : @entity143 , drugs , and bipolar disorder stress , whether it stems from the pressure to succeed academically or to fit in socially , can trigger mania as well			1
according to @entity151 , @entity152 , the director of counseling and psychological services at the @entity155 student health center , the desire to fit in and conform to the college lifestyle can cause some bipolar students to abandon healthy behaviors -- even their medications			1
college life often reveals the symptoms of bipolar disorder for the first time , particularly for those at risk of the condition who have not yet been diagnosed			1
( the college years , in fact , overlap with the stage in life in which bipolar disorder typically first appears -- between 19 and 23 years old , according to some estimates			1
) @entity172 , 22 , experienced his first manic episode at the @entity174 , @entity175			0
his lifestyle was less than healthy : in college he smoked a lot of marijuana and experimented with hallucinogenic mushrooms and a drug similar to @entity182			2
he had a serious depressive episode his freshman year , and then , in the winter of his sophomore year , he entered a full - blown manic episode with psychosis			0
" i thought i was having an existential breakthrough , but it was really a manic high , " @entity172 says			0
@entity0 : what is mania in bipolar disorder ? @entity151 says that the symptoms of bipolar disorder do not appear spontaneously			1
" the lifestyle irregularities and the stresses of college life do n't in and of themselves cause bipolar disorder , " he explains			1
" you need a genetic vulnerability for bipolar disorder to emerge			1
but if you 've got that vulnerability , the lifestyle irregularities of the first and second year of college can certainly be a precipitant			2
" strategies for managing bipolar disorder students who have been diagnosed with a bipolar spectrum disorder can take steps to minimize the risk of a relapse and stay balanced			1
perhaps the most important step is to make sure you have a support system at school , which usually means connecting with the medical and counseling staff on campus			2
students who attend school away from home may choose to maintain contact with their existing psychiatrist , but experts urge students to also make contact with campus health services			2
" even if a student with bipolar disorder has what they consider to be their primary health provider at home , they need to have someone at college as well , " says @entity228 , @entity152 , the director of counseling and psychological services at @entity231			1
" and if a student with bipolar disorder is looking at a college in a rural community , they need to be proactive about what their local access to psychiatric care will be			1
" having a psychiatrist close at hand is n't important only for emergencies			0
in fact , bipolar students who have been stabilized on medication while at home may need to fine - tune their prescriptions while at school			2
" students sometimes need adjustments to their medication in the new environment , " @entity27 says			2
" it varies a lot , depending on the resiliency of the student , the supports that are already in place , and how much of an academic challenge the student is facing			0
" @entity0 : how the right drugs can treat bipolar disorder campus health services also provide counseling , which can help students cope with the emotional stress of living with bipolar disorder			1
just as important , counseling can teach students everyday strategies for managing their symptoms			0
in his 2010 book , " facing @entity278 : the @entity285 's guide to dealing with @entity278 " , @entity151 outlines what he calls the " four @entity282 's of bipolar stability " : structure , stress management , sleep management , and self - monitoring			2
this framework entails setting -- and sticking to -- a regular schedule of studying and sleep , and learning to recognize the signs that you are beginning to drift into mania or hypomania			0
@entity297 , 26 , who graduated from @entity298 in may 2008 , has what her doctor calls @entity301 , a diagnosis that typically describes a form of hypomania associated with antidepressants			0
@entity0 : bipolar is one disorder with many faces dealing with depressive episodes in college , @entity297 never knew when she was going to crash , so she made sure to do her assignments well ahead of time			1
she also talked to her professors on the first day of class about her mental health and documented her case at disability services on campus			0
students tend to associate such resources with physical disabilities , but these centers often help students with mental health disorders as well			0
" i felt ok about sharing with professors , and they were great about working with me , " @entity297 says			0
" be prepared to encounter people who do n't understand , but try to get the college behind you			0
" other sources of support on campus in addition to campus health services , peer counseling can be a valuable source of support			0
@entity96 began leading a @entity338 ( @entity338 ) support group on her campus because she does n't want students to feel as alone as she did her freshman year			1
she advises students with mental illness to reach out			0
" we want to make people more aware of the counseling office at orientation , " she says			0
" one of our major messages is , ' you are not alone			0
' " @entity0 : avoiding the stigma of depression and bipolar disorder @entity172 took a semester off from school and spent a summer at a community college near his home before returning to the @entity174 , @entity175 in the fall of 2008			1
as a senior , he communicated often with his doctor and parents , a strategy that helped him remain stable			0
he tried to schedule his classes in the middle of the day to facilitate a regular sleep schedule , and he did his best to avoid alcohol and drugs			0
however , he struggled to find a group of peers who have dealt with mental health problems			0
in addition to @entity338 , an organization called @entity371 is trying to open the dialogue about mental illness on college campuses			1
founded by @entity375 in 2001 , following the suicide of her older brother , the organization now has more than 200 chapters nationwide			0
@entity371 organizes events such as @entity380 and has partnered with the @entity381 to create peer support groups on college campuses			2

students with bipolar disorder are even more vulnerable in college
the @entity338 support group helps students *worldwide*
