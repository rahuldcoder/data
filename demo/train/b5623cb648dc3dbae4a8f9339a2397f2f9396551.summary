-- it 's that time again , time to pull out the ballots and read the tea leaves and see who 's going to take home the trophies at sunday 's 86th @entity7			1
will it be " @entity9 " ? @entity12 ? " @entity10 " from " frozen " ? @entity7 forecasting is a lighthearted parlor game for many and a " who cares " shrug for others			1
( go ahead , commenters , let us know how you really feel ! ) but to studios , agents , managers and many of the nominees , winning the @entity7 is not only first - line - of - the - obituary recognition , but it also means " cold , hard cash , " as @entity7 winner @entity28 once bluntly put it , in box - office receipts and future contracts			1
with that in mind -- and with the possibility of some of this article 's readers taking home cold , hard cash for winning their @entity7 pools -- here are a few key indicators to follow at the 2014 @entity7 sunday night			1
of course , the @entity7 being the @entity7 , nothing is guaranteed			1
what are the best picture front - runners ? there may be nine nominees for best picture , but only three have a good chance of winning , says @entity48 of the awards handicapping site @entity51 : " 12 years a slave , " " gravity " and " @entity54			1
" " 12 years " is the favorite among his 30 experts , with " gravity " second at 10 - 3 odds and " @entity60 " at 50 - 1			1
everything else is 100 - 1			2
its social awards season app , @entity65 , crunched the numbers based on mentions on @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and film - related sites			1
it determined that " 12 years " has 42 % of the online mentions ( as of february 24 ) and " gravity " is second with 33 %			2
but , points out @entity74 of @entity75 , in a year with divisive choices -- and " 12 years , " though widely hailed , is not necessarily widely loved -- the preferential voting system for best picture can favor everybody 's second choice			1
that 's " gravity , " which also has the benefit of being the people 's choice as the highest - grossing film among the nominees			1
film editing is your friend of course , best picture is the last category of the night			1
what are some of the early signs that one of these films has an edge ? the film editing category may seem minor to @entity7 viewers , but it often has an outsized role in showcasing best picture winners			1
@entity48 observes that the best picture has won the editing @entity7 more than half the time -- and if you rule out action - oriented flicks such as " @entity108 , " " @entity109 " and " the @entity110 , " it 's even more predictive			1
this year 's editing nominees include all three best picture front - runners along with " @entity114 , " directed by the handheld - camera - favoring , quick - cutting @entity116 , and " @entity117			1
" " gravity " is the favorite , says @entity48 , and that could foretell a spacey night			1
but even more notable will be if " 12 years " or " @entity60 " grabs the trophy , since a win would be so unexpected			0
as for " @entity123 , " that would simply acknowledge the expertise of @entity126 and editor @entity127 -- who won for " ultimatum " six years ago			0
pressing the flesh though overt @entity7 campaigning is frowned upon , there 's nothing wrong with showing up at industry functions , saying the right things , posing for pictures and shaking a few hands			1
that could make a difference in the best actor category , whose favorites are @entity142 ( " @entity117 " ) and @entity12 ( " @entity143 of @entity144 " )			0
though both have some high - profile wins , they have yet to face off in the same category			2
( both won @entity150 , but @entity142 's was for a drama and @entity12 's was for comedy			2
) and when it comes to politicking , @entity12 has played the game well , says @entity48 , who points out that the " @entity157 " star has been making the rounds with humor and class			0
" when i look at the list of past winners of best actor , i see movie stars , " he says			0
" there 's kind of a veteran glow to it			2
with @entity12 being overdue , it 's to his advantage -- and he 's given the biggest performance of his career in the most talked - about movie of the year			1
" but @entity142 may have a secret weapon			0
no , not his extreme weight loss			0
try " true detective " on @entity176 , which has become an addictive hit			0
" ( one academy member ) told me he 's voting for @entity142 because he 's addicted to ' true detective , ' " says @entity48			1
technically speaking " gravity " is up for several technical awards , including production design , sound editing , sound mixing and visual effects			0
it 's considered the front - runner for most of them			1
if it falters , it could be a long night for director @entity189 and his film			1
" if you see ' gravity ' lose some techs , it 's indicative that it 's not going all the way , " says @entity74			1
a ' slave ' surprise " @entity9 " has fewer technical nominations but has a number of acting nods : best actor @entity201 , best supporting actor @entity202 and best supporting actress @entity203			1
only @entity203 is given a strong shot to win -- she 's the top pick of @entity207 's experts -- but if @entity202 and @entity201 triumph , expect " slave " to take it all			0
@entity202 has the toughest road , says @entity48			0
the academy has softened up about giving @entity7 for villainous roles , but there 's usually a wink involved -- think @entity215 in " @entity218 " or even @entity216 in " @entity217			1
" not so for @entity202 's character , a vicious slave owner			0
" he 's pure @entity222 , " says @entity48			0
do the " @entity60 " " @entity54 " did even better among the major categories -- it 's the only film nominated in the @entity224 of picture , director , actor , actress , supporting actor and supporting actress			1
but of all the film 's nominees , only @entity231 -- who 's won a @entity232 and a @entity233 , and who 's the most popular actress in the world right now -- is considered a threat in her category , best supporting actress			1
the key is probably @entity242 , up for best actress			0
that category is considered a runaway for @entity247 of " @entity248 , " but if the @entity250 controversy has rubbed off on her , five - time nominee @entity244 could take the @entity7 and indicate bigger things for the film about the ' 70s @entity254 scandal			1
@entity74 is doubtful , though			0
even the @entity255 gave up a touchdown during the @entity257 , he says			0
" i 'm sure she 'll lose a couple votes , but not enough to matter , " he says			0
watch @entity260 producer @entity260 is the master of awards gamesmanship			0
he makes high - quality , often audience - friendly films with good casts -- " @entity265 , " " @entity266 , " @entity268 's films -- and he knows how to promote them			1
this year he 's putting his chips on his best picture nominee , " @entity273			0
" the film has earned good reviews , done respectable box office and features the ageless @entity277			0
it has a good shot at adapted screenplay , which was co-written by star @entity281 , and @entity277 is a seven - time nominee who 's won once before			2
along with @entity283 's " @entity143 of @entity144 , " it 's probably the leading dark horse -- but whereas " @entity157 " is divisive , " @entity273 " is liked			0
@entity48 thinks screenplay is possible -- " sometimes the most emotional movie wins " -- but thinks that might be it			0
still , at least " @entity273 " picked up a best picture nomination			0
@entity260 's other major film , " august : @entity291 , " did n't even get that			2
splitting tickets finally , this is an odd handicapping year			0
usually the best director has directed the best picture , but this year the handicappers are picking " @entity297 for best director and " @entity9 " for best picture			2
when the two categories differ , it 's a surprise , not an expectation			0
@entity74 ca n't shake the feeling that voters wo n't split their votes -- and that will make " gravity " the big winner			2
( sorry , " 12 years " director @entity308			0
) @entity189 not only won the top award from the @entity310 , but " gravity " also tied " 12 years " as the best film picked by the @entity312 -- which , given the @entity314 's use of the preferential ballot , was an incredible shocker			1
and @entity48 suggests another indicator : " gravity " star @entity318 , who 's up for best actress			2
" if ' gravity ' wins best picture , @entity318 might go along for the rocket ride , " he says			0
" she is ' gravity ' -- she 's the whole movie			2
" one sure thing ? this wo n't predict the best picture winner , but if you 're looking to check off a category on your @entity7 ballot , look no further than " @entity332 : ' @entity333 ' , " a documentary short subject about a @entity336 survivor who lived to be 110			2
as @entity338 noted in @entity339 , she died sunday -- two days before @entity7 voting ended			1
@entity338 sums it up : " we 're done here			0
" dominoes and randomness a lot of the foregoing , of course , assumes the @entity7 are logical			2
let us emphasize : the @entity7 are not logical			2
they are a popularity contest , a business proposition , a plea for attention , a throw of a dart			0
sometimes films gather momentum like so many falling dominoes , as " @entity357 " did last year			0
other times big favorites fall short at the end : 1976 's " network " won three of four acting categories but lost best picture to " @entity365 " ; 1972 's " cabaret " took home eight @entity7 -- including best director -- but lost best picture to " @entity369			1
" and if you need any more proof that the @entity7 universe can be as random as a roll of the dice , consider two words : @entity376			2
good luck in your pool .			0

" @entity9 , " " gravity , " " @entity54 " are @entity7 front - runners
each film has route to the big prize
voting for @entity7 only partly about art ; it 's often about *personalities*
