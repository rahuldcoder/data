-- green living is a spiritual calling for a group of @entity5 women in the upper @entity6			2
call it a heavenly approach to being good stewards of the @entity10			0
while most people do n't think about sustainable buildings in a spiritual light , the @entity11 , @entity12 , believe they should			1
the ecumenical order 's new @entity11 scored the highest number of points ever awarded by the @entity21 @entity20 's @entity19 ( @entity19 ) rating system for new construction			1
@entity11 is run by three @entity11 sisters			1
the idea that they wanted to build the most sustainable , cutting - edge , eco-friendly building in the @entity21 is surprising to some ; but given the order 's mission , it 's an obvious fit for the women			1
" people who know us see it as falling out of our mission			0
they see it as something they would expect from us , " sister @entity38 said			0
one of the order 's core values is " care for the @entity10			0
" " people who do n't know us , who come into the building , are surprised by its elegance and simplicity			2
and they ask the same question : ' why would a small community of women do such a thing ? ' " said @entity38			0
" but when we talk to them about who we are and why we think it 's important to do this , and , in our day and age , why it 's even more important that our religious people think about caring of the @entity10 , then they 're very open to that			0
" also surprising : the building 's sustainability statistics			0
@entity11 sits on 130 rural acres , just outside @entity69			2
the original building , once a @entity71 for girls , was torn down and 99.75 percent of the material was either reused or recycled			2
@entity74 designed and built the monastery at a cost of $ 246 per square foot , or just over $ 7.5 million for demolition through construction			1
" there 's a long list of reasons this building is the greenest in the @entity21 right now , " said company owner @entity80			1
" for one , the building is projected to save at least 60 percent on energy costs alone			1
" that 's because the heating and cooling systems are powered by 39 geothermal wells , closed - loop wells sunk deep in the earth			2
@entity80 says the geothermal wells work so efficiently that on some days , the monastery actually sells energy to the utility , instead of buying it			1
photovoltaic lights , which are cells that convert sunlight into electricity , are used in the parking lot			1
another set of photovoltaic cells on the monastery 's roof generates 15 percent of the building 's energy needs			1
eventually the monastery hopes to generate all of its own energy from on - site renewable sources			2
the windows in the monastery are unique			2
they were specially designed for the building using a new technique			1
" we used @entity118 wood windows and they developed a special highly sustainable window with special glazing , " @entity80 said			0
" so there 's absolutely no blinds , shades , or draperies in the building because the glass is the thing that transmits the light , but eliminates the glare , yet grabs the solar heat gains			0
" @entity80 hired the green consulting firm @entity131 , based in @entity132 , @entity133 , to help coordinate the many complex aspects involved in constructing a sustainable building and completing the very complicated @entity21 @entity20 leed certification process			1
construction methods for a green building are very different from traditional ones , according to @entity140 , @entity131 's general manager			0
" the person who designs the structure of the building , the person who designs the mechanical systems like the air conditioning , the people who design the plumbing , and even the outside landscape , they all have to work together , " he said			0
" in recent times in design and construction , they have n't worked together			0
they 've worked kind of in a bubble			0
" then , @entity140 added , " one person brings it all together , puts it on a drawing and then the contractor goes out and builds it			0
" that process does n't work very well for green projects , he said			0
" this is a situation where we tried to take the talents of all those people , integrate them so they 're doing their work at one time , and they 're really being mindful of each other and supportive of each other 's disciplines and needs , in order to maximize the energy efficiency , the water efficiency , the impact on the environment that their own discipline might have " as the building is being constructed , @entity140 said			2
while the monastery officially opened last august , the @entity11 sisters just found out last month their building achieved the highest @entity19 rating ever awarded by the @entity21 @entity20 for a new construction building , 63 out of a possible 69 points			1
and that gives the @entity11 sisters a heavenly end to their monastery construction project .			1
