-- running has always been an enigma to me			1
it seems so simple : lace up your sneakers , crank up the music and head out the door			0
it comes so easy to some people , but it never has to me			0
growing up , i tried to be a runner			0
at an early age , i was diagnosed with exercise - induced asthma			2
this is an inflammation and constriction of the bronchi in the lungs that occurs after a few minutes of strenuous or aerobic activity			0
i was prescribed various inhalers to control the condition , and they seemed to decrease the asthma , but it never completely stopped			1
it was annoying , it was embarrassing , and it caused me to avoid most exercises , especially running			2
i am not a runner ... make your workout go by faster i decided to start playing tennis in middle school			0
while i always had great bursts of speed on the court , the off - season running workouts killed me			2
still , i could control my asthma , and my tennis skills slowly improved			2
then my next nemesis arrived			0
i discovered a nasty pain called shin splints , from pounding those hard courts day after day			1
this condition is also called medial tibial stress syndrome and is caused by a combination of factors that put stress on the lower leg , causing some very uncomfortable pain in my shins and cramping in my calves when running			1
the pain , or rather the threat of the pain , kept me from running long distances , so i stopped			1
i am not a runner ... fast - forward to later in life			0
i wanted to try to run again			0
after some research and a visit to my local running shop , i discovered a compression strap for my calf that could help my shin splints , and it worked ! t - shirt tales : the athlete i used to be so off to run i went			1
all was going great : i was gaining endurance while managing to control the asthma and the shin splints			1
then i started to get a sharp pain just in front of my heel on the bottom of my foot			2
this pain occurred right after my running workouts , and it was even worse the next morning			1
my doctor diagnosed me with plantar fasciitis in my left foot			1
this is an incredibly painful inflammation of the connective tissue ( the plantar fascia ) that stretches from your heel to your toes			2
with this pain , i had found my newest nemesis			2
i tried to run through the pain , but even walking during the day became painful , so i stopped running altogether			1
there are many treatments for helping manage this pain , from special socks that stretch the tissue to cortisone injections that help the inflammation			2
i found an orthotic shoe insert that helped to stretch the plantar fascia , and slowly , the pain went away			1
' too fat to do a lot of things ' but once again , the threat of pain kept me from running			1
i am not a runner ... fast - forward to today			0
i 've developed a love of endurance sports and an admiration for the amazing athletes who compete in them , from runners to cyclists to triathletes			0
i 've always wanted to participate , but the fear of pain or asthma has always kept me on the sidelines			1
i know that my pain is manageable and my fear is irrational			0
getting fit for the family i love as i 've started training for the @entity127 , i constantly think of my @entity129 teammates , many of whom have conquered their own obstacles , much more serious than the pain that has stopped me			1
we all have hurdles in life , some great and some small , that try to prevent us from doing the things we want to do			0
my mantra had become " i am not a runner , " but it was just an excuse			0
this excuse no longer stops me			0
my minor injuries and pains are nothing compared with the hardships many people face every day			0
my pain and anxiety are manageable , and i am no longer afraid			1
perspective is a wonderful thing , and when i think of all of the amazing people in my life who have overcome much larger hurdles than those that have stopped me in the past , i am motivated			1
i keep moving , knowing that if they can overcome their obstacles , i can overcome mine			0
my running workouts are n't breaking any endurance records , and i do n't move that fast , but i keep moving			0
i lace up my sneakers and crank up my music , and i keep running because my pain is temporary			1
i am not a runner ... yet ! follow @entity166 on @entity167 @ @entity168			0
