@entity0 , @entity1 -- her outfits do n't send royal fashion watchers into a frenzy like those of the @entity8 or princess @entity9 before her , but @entity10 has developed a signature style that has withstood the test of time			1
her attire over the last 60 years has reflected the sovereign as a @entity17 symbol of refined , regal elegance			1
the looks she has worn have steadily evolved into her trademark -- monochromatic color with matching coat and hat			2
not one to wear sombre , muted hues like black or beige , the queen has always had a preference for vivid blues , intense greens and dazzling purples in a variety of dramatic shades			2
over the past six decades , her majesty has employed the talents of several @entity17 designers			1
one of her first designers was @entity38 , who worked for her in the 1940s and created many of the full - skirted evening silk dresses she wore to various events as a glamorous young princess			1
as a newly crowned queen in the early 1950s , she chose @entity49 tailor @entity47 to create elegant evening gowns for her waspish 23 - inch ( 58cm ) waist			1
he was granted the coveted @entity53 in 1955			0
@entity47 once famously declared : " i do not dress the queen			1
we supply her with her clothes -- there is a difference			2
" two decades later the queen chose a young designer , @entity58 , to soften her look with " flowing chiffon dresses , " according to the @entity61 website			1
couture designer @entity62 started making outfits for her majesty in 1988 and the queen still wears his designs			1
he also dressed the @entity65 and describes the queen 's clothes as a work uniform			1
he told @entity2 : " they have to be comfortable in as much as when the queen puts on the clothes she wants to forget about them			1
" you have to take into account the different countries and the different climates in which they 'll be worn			0
the queen always makes sure that she follows the tradition			1
" while most people would be hard pressed to imagine what they will be wearing the next day , the queen 's wardrobe is planned out months in advance , says @entity62			2
" it 's not the case that the queen is going somewhere next week and thinks ' what am i going to wear ? ' sometimes it is six months , 12 months or longer			2
" see a map of @entity87 a very @entity89 patron one person who is currently in the queen 's fashion inner circle is couturier and wedding dress designer @entity93			1
he first started making royal outfits in 2000 and recalls the secretive selection process that took place before he started working for the queen			1
" at first i was n't told who it was for , " @entity93 told @entity2			1
" it was , ' could you design for someone who is a really prominent person in the public eye and wants a very chic image ? ' i thought it was going to be a politician or a tycoon 's wife			2
i put together a packet of sketches but it was n't until they were chosen i knew who they were for			0
" " she is someone who is very interested in her clothes			2
she always has an opinion on it and she has a very informed opinion and she knows when it 's right and she knows when it 's wrong , " said @entity93 , who designs two couture collections a year and was in 2007 awarded the @entity53 -- given to designers who have worked with the queen for five years or more			1
an ensemble fit for a queen both @entity93 and @entity62 told @entity2 the queen is very involved in the design process , culminating with fittings at @entity129			1
" sometimes i choose the fabric and then propose ideas for them , as i would do for any client , " said @entity93			2
" i put together a scheme , maybe four designs for one fabric combination , then she would look at them and either choose a design straight away or suggest some changes			0
" @entity62 says the queen asks him to come up with two or three different alternatives for a particular fabric she likes before settling on a final design			0
" i do get a lot of input from the queen , " said @entity62			0
" the pressure is there but i take great joy out of it and it 's very rewarding to see @entity10 wearing my clothes in public			0
" in addition to warrant - holding royal designers , her majesty also has a senior dresser and personal assistant , @entity158			1
the daughter of a @entity161 dockworker , dressmaker @entity158 originally joined the royal household as a maid before working her way up to her current position			0
she established the first ever in - house couturier and has gone on to design outfits for some of the most enviable royal events including last year 's wedding of prince @entity172 to @entity8			1
known to have a close relationship with the queen , it has been noted by some royal observers that @entity158 has slipped into the vacancies left by the deaths of the queen 's sister and mother			2
@entity158 and her team use old and new fabrics when designing for the queen using material given to her from when she was a princess , according to the @entity129 website			0
hats off to her majesty ! @entity188 @entity187 received a royal warrant following 12 years working for the queen			1
now , when the queen steps out she 's usually wearing a @entity192 creation			0
" you have to realize that you are never sure when @entity10 will wear ( a particular hat ) , " he said			0
" it depends on the weather on many occasions			0
you are also creating something that has to be very wearable and must be in colors that suit her			0
she must be noticed in a crowd			0
" after 33 years in the business , @entity187 stepped down as the queen 's hatter handing the business over to @entity208			2
" i 've been here for some time now and we 've always had a @entity187 look which is very clean , understated and elegant , " said @entity209			0
creating a hat fit for a queen is not without its pressures , @entity209 says			0
" you know you are under a certain pressure because of the press and what people are going to say , " he said			0
" you know she is going to be looked at			0
there are certain styles that you can and ca n't do but within those limits there 's lots that you can do			0
it 's quite a challenge but the queen can be quite adventurous			0

famed for her unique hats and bold colors , the queen has a trademark fashion style
for years her clothes were made by @entity17 designer @entity47 , now couturier @entity93 makes her eye - catching outfits
designers are given royal warrants to become dressers to the queen and it is no easy feat getting one
