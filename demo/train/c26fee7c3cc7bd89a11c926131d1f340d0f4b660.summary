a source said wednesday that @entity8 fighter jets had struck a @entity1 convoy suspected of moving @entity11 - made missile parts that could have been used to attack @entity8			1

the report in @entity1 state media tied the attack to @entity1 's ongoing rebellion , saying @entity8 struck the site after repeated attempts by what the regime of @entity1 president @entity60 refers to as terrorist groups failed to capture the facility			0
experts say @entity60 's regime is faltering after nearly two years of fending off the persistent rebellion , and a former high - ranking @entity8 intelligence official said @entity3 probably wants to take hold of all the weapons it can before that happens			2

@entity15 @entity109 ban ki - moon 's office issued a statement thursday expressing " grave concern " about the incident , but said @entity15 officials lacked details about exactly what had happened			1
@entity11 , a @entity1 ally , said it also had " grave concern " about wednesday 's airstrike			1
" if the information is confirmed , we are dealing with unprovoked attacks on targets situated on the territory of a sovereign state that grossly violates the @entity124 and is unacceptable whatever motives are used to justify it , " the @entity118 said thursday			0
@entity2 also backed its close ally			0
