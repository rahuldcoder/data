-- even after his debilitating stroke eight years ago , even after all the subsequent public appearances and @entity4 's @entity3 when his speech was slurred and his once - impeccable timing seemed to have checked out for eternity , @entity1 still appeared somehow above and beyond normal physical laws			1
for decades , we had doubted he would ever grow old			0
this past december 31 , you watched and listened as he counted backwards for yet another year , missing no numbers on the short path to 2012			0
and you thought to yourself : this man can not be stopped			0
like the promise of the @entity20 : reliable , no matter what the weather , no matter what time of day , month or decade			0
for almost 60 years , excluding the one immediately after his 2004 stroke , reliable and unstoppable was what @entity1 was			1
that is , until wednesday , when @entity1 died at age 82			1
for those of a certain age , writing those last six words seems so improbable that you 're not sure you want to expose them to light			0
acknowledging them is like sealing a door to youthful paradise when what 's now old and obsolete is forever sexy , frisky and fun			1
some of you may find this bewildering			0
you 're likely among those who knew @entity1 only as somebody your parents and grandparents watched on tv , hovering in a booth over @entity47 every @entity48 , interrupting some pop music acts to tell people the ball was about to drop on whatever the last calendar year was			2
as indelible as this gig was , it was only one of many @entity1 had as game - show host , restaurant - chain proprietor , media mogul and music impresario on " @entity60			1
" it was in that latter role that most of us born after @entity64 cherish him the most			0
between 1952 ( when he was a frequent substitute for regular host @entity68 when it was just called " bandstand " ) and 1988 ( the year before he yielded hosting duties in the show 's final year to @entity67 ) , @entity1 presided over " @entity60 , " the most enduring and iconic of television programs , on which teenagers danced to popular records and watched pop stars -- from @entity76 to @entity77 , from @entity78 to @entity79 , from @entity80 to @entity81 -- lip - synch their hits			1
first broadcast from @entity85 , the show went from local to national in august 1957 and every weekday afternoon from that month until 1963 , @entity60 was probably the only thing you saw on television between school and supper			1
call it the mid- 20th century manner of containing multitudes			0
and , for generations of kids , of marking time			2
and we kept marking time with " @entity60 , " even as it moved from weekdays to saturday afternoons and then to @entity99 , losing much of the funky charm of its @entity85 days			2
yet its format remained as predictable and comfortable as an old sweater			0
kids still danced , records were still rated and pop acts from the @entity107 to the @entity108 still came to play			2
@entity1 had begun building his empire in the late 1950s with a weekly saturday night program of live , lip - synched performances , " the @entity1 saturday night @entity113			1
" it did n't last long , but @entity1 , as noted , was unstoppable			2
he had another spinoff series , " @entity117 , " in the 1960s and soon became as unavoidable as the weather by hosting " the $ 10,000 @entity121 " ( which grew in other versions to $ 25,000 and $ 100,000 ) and co-hosting with one - time @entity85 colleague @entity119 , " @entity120			0
" he invented the annual " @entity123 " and " @entity1 's @entity124 " ( first broadcast in 1972 )			1
these and other @entity1 productions enjoyed longevity that seemed as inexplicable and impregnable as @entity1 's youthful glow			1
@entity1 's personality throughout these years never wavered			1
even as his entertainment empire grew to include radio shows ( " @entity133 " ) and restaurants ( " @entity1 's @entity132 " ) , he remained the personable young man keeping the party from getting out of hand			1
he seemed born knowing the secret of lasting long on tv : no idiosyncrasies , no temperament and no fretting			0
if you can keep your personality as smooth as your complexion , nobody will ask you to leave their living rooms , not even if the friends you bring along with you have strange hairdos and make even stranger music			0
and if you can adapt such a persona to places where such exotic personages as @entity153 and @entity154 hang out , you can carry it anywhere for a long time , making it look easier than it likely was			0
it was only in those last years , when @entity1 insisted on dropping by our homes despite his frail condition , that it looked harder			2
and even here , there was a kind of stoic grace that touched you , even if you started to wonder , if for only a second , how much longer he could continue			0
another myth , a grail of durability , drifts away , leaving us all feeling a tad more vulnerable -- and , maybe , much emptier -- than we did last @entity4 's			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			2

@entity175 : it seemed that @entity1 would defy physical laws , last forever
@entity1 was known for @entity4 's show , but more so for " @entity60 "
@entity182 : show was a must - see for kids in the ' 50s and ' 60s ; it endured even till the ' 80s
@entity182 : @entity1 was smooth and with staying power ; his loss points out our vulnerability
