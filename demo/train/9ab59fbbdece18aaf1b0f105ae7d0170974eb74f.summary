" since early august there has been no telephone contact between the @entity77 president and @entity2 prime minister and that 's a reflection in part with @entity2 's deepening isolation in the @entity30 and also frustration in @entity7 at @entity76 's reluctance to get involved in the conflict in @entity69 , " he said			1
