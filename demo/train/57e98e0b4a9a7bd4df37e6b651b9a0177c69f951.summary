-- human rights groups in @entity2 and abroad are calling for an investigation after 16 borders guards accused of participating in a bloody revolt in february died in custody in recent days			1
a @entity8 soldier is shown wearing a white cloth signifying surrender in late february			1
the @entity2 military acknowledged the deaths of the @entity8 paramilitary troops , or jawans -- but insisted they were the result of illness and suicide			1
" given the history of abuses by security forces in @entity2 , there is no reason to take at face value the claim that these detainees have committed suicide , " said @entity18 , @entity19 director or the @entity21 - based @entity20 , in a statement			1
the 16 were among 1,100 jawans rounded up after a 35 - hour mutiny that began on february 25 in the @entity8 headquarters in the capital city , @entity36			1
the jawans rebelled against their commanding officers , taking dozens of them hostage			0
when the standoff ended , more than 70 people were found dead -- the majority of them army officers			0
initially , @entity2 prime minister @entity44 promised the jawans amnesty if they laid down their arms			1
but once the scope of the massacre came to light , @entity44 withdrew her offer -- saying the government will not show mercy to those who killed , looted or committed arson			0
the jawans were issued an ultimatum to turn themselves in , while the government created a committee to probe into the mutiny			1
the result of the government inquiry is yet to be made public , after several delays			0
on thursday , the @entity8 leadership issued a statement that said 16 detainees have died in custody since march 9 : four from suicide , six from heart attacks and six from other diseases			1
" we believe that perhaps they have failed to cope with the mental pressure associated with the guilt of committing the brutal attacks , " the statement said			1
it then added : " suicide is seen as a sin in religious terms and is also socially undesirable			0
" in response , the legal aid group , @entity80 ( @entity81 and @entity82 ) , and the @entity83 were among several organizations calling for an investigation			0
during a hearing wednesday , one of the suspects told a @entity36 court he had been administered electric shocks during a seven - day detention			1
family members of other detainees have made similar allegations			0
some of the suspects who died in custody had wounds on their bodies consisted with torture , @entity20 said			2
@entity2 authorities have said the wounds may have been inflicted when the suspects tried to escape from the @entity8 headquarters after the rebellion			1
" the explanations given by representatives of the security forces are simply not credible , " @entity18 said			0
" torture is a regular ' investigative technique ' in @entity2 and killing of detains in government custody is an endemic problem			1
" the country 's elite anti-crime unit , @entity112 ( @entity112 ) , have often been accused of ' extra-judicial ' killings			2
the battalion is involved in the interrogation of many of the @entity8 suspects			0
since its inception in 2004 , more than 550 alleged criminals died soon after they were captured by @entity112 forces			2
in each case , the battalion claimed the arrested men died from stray bullets as their units were engaged in gun battles with the suspects ' comrades			2
the 65,000 - strong @entity8 is responsible primarily for guarding the country 's borders , but it also takes part in operations such as monitoring polls			2
it is distinct from the army , but their commanders are career army officers			0
the troops staged their rebellion on the second day of @entity143 , when officers and troops from various @entity143 outposts along the border were in the capital for celebrations			2
@entity150 had been bubbling for years in the ranks of the @entity143 , who complained their army superiors dismissed their appeals for more pay , subsidized food and their requests to participate in @entity159 peacekeeping operations -- which pay far more than what they make at home			0
@entity2 and its @entity164 neighbors are the largest troop contributors to @entity159 peacekeeping operations			1
during the stand - off , dozens of officers were killed			0
some bodies were dumped in mass graves			0
others were tossed in sewers that emptied into a river , where they floated for miles before being retrieved .			0
