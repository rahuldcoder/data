-- the level of odorous chemical in @entity4 ' water dropped friday , but not enough for authorities to lift a warning to avoid drinking , cooking or bathing with it or to give a clear idea as to when things will change			1
gov. @entity13 described the situation in nine counties friday night as " pretty bad , " both for residents being told the only thing they should do with their running water is flush their toilets and schools , restaurants , hotels and other businesses forced to close			1
one bit of good news is tests on the affected water supply , which are being conducted on an hourly basis , show " the chemical level is declining			1
" " but we 're just not sure exactly how long it 's going to take before it 's acceptable to lift the do - not - drink ban , " the governor told @entity0			1
much of the anger centers around the coal - industry company from which the chemical leak occurred			1
and there 's also frustration among some -- including @entity41 , the mayor of @entity43 's most populated city and capital , @entity45 -- that the water company trying to deal with the resulting mess still does n't have a timeline for when things will return to normal			1
" it 's caused us more problems than you could ever imagine , " @entity41 said friday night , pointing out people ca n't do things like wash their hands after going to bathroom or wash their clothes			1
" ... it 's a prison from which we would like to be released			1
" utility official on water : ' i ca n't say it is safe ' the crisis began thursday , when residents of @entity67 reported a foul odor -- similar to licorice -- in the air			1
the @entity71 and the state @entity72 that day traced that smell to a leak from a 35,000 - gallon storage tank along the @entity77			1
the chemical had overflowed a containment area around the tank run by @entity81 , then migrated over land and through the soil into the river			0
the leak happened about a mile upriver from the impacted @entity87 plant			1
after concluding the tap water was contaminated late thursday afternoon , a stop - use warning went out to customers in @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity67 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity99 counties			1
@entity87 's president @entity100 said friday he did n't believe the substance -- 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol -- was still flowing			1
but that does n't mean the situation will be resolved soon			1
what is 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol ? " it is not intended to be in the water ( or ) distribution system , " @entity107 said			1
" ... once it 's in there , there 's no more treatment for it			1
" while there have n't been reported widespread sicknesses , the ordeal is having a big impact			0
@entity121 president @entity120 told reporters friday more than 300,000 people have been affected			1
@entity13 gave a lower estimate -- saying it was " way over 100,000 ( but ) we do n't have an exact number yet of people ... without water			1
" businesses -- including 15 @entity131 in the area , according to their ownership group -- have shut down			0
hospitals have taken emergency measures to conserve water			2
and residents have been scrambling , as evidenced by empty shelves and worries at home			0
" it 's all very hectic , " said @entity141 of @entity45			1
" you do n't even want to go to the grocery store			0
i think everyone is in a panic			0
" emergency rooms busy , businesses closed the emergency 's ripple effects included the closure friday of the state @entity153 in @entity45 , courts in @entity91 and @entity95 counties , and the cancellation of classes at @entity159			1
in addition to shuttering her shop @entity163 & more on friday -- usually her busiest day -- @entity141 noted other ripple effects , like how her 60 - year - old husband 's physical therapy session tied to a recent knee surgery was canceled			2
" the problem is that no one seems to know when we 'll have the water restored , " she said			2
first responders and hospitals saw a rush of activity after the alert went out			0
@entity120 said more than 1,000 calls were placed in four or five hours to the 911 center , 24 of them for emergency medical services -- five of which led to people being taken to hospitals			1
water company spokeswoman @entity185 urged people to get medical attention " if they are feeling something ... is n't right			1
" many -- perhaps too many -- did just that			0
" our emergency rooms have been very busy with individuals unnecessarily concerned and presenting no symptoms , " said @entity191			0
the restrictions affected the hospital in other ways , too			0
it put into place linen conservation and alternative cleaning methods and turned away all but emergency patients			0
@entity203 sued the water utility and @entity81 , saying his kidney transplant surgery was canceled because of the ordeal " forcing ( him ) to undergo dialysis , pain and suffering and continued illness due to his renal failure and other medical damages			2
" @entity87 " failed to maintain an appropriate emergency response plan , " @entity203 claimed , while @entity81 " failed to properly maintain and store its chemicals			2
" a lawsuit was filed friday by a man whose scheduled kidney transplant was canceled due to the water issue , said attorney @entity216 said			2
@entity0 reached out to the water company about the lawsuit			1
" @entity87 is not focused on litigation at this time			0
our focus is on our customers and providing safe adequate water supplies , " the company said in a statement			1
leaked chemical used to wash coal @entity81 is feeling the heat from others as well			0
president @entity233 tried several times to walk away from a press conference friday evening , saying " it has been an extremely long day , " only to be called back by insistent reporters -- including one who noted how long a day it has been for all the @entity4 now without drinkable water or a full explanation as to why			2
" this incident is extremely unfortunate and unanticipated , " @entity242 said			0
" ... this has been a very , very taxing process			0
" @entity248 's crippled steel tank is about a mile upriver from the @entity87 plant , according to @entity107			2
according to @entity120 , the county official , it 's part of a former @entity254 refinery dating back to the 1930s or 1940s			2
@entity41 , @entity45 's mayor , said he believes " the chemicals went through ( holes in a retaining ) wall			1
" @entity242 said two @entity248 employees noticed material leaking from a storage tank into a dyke around 10:30 a.m. thursday			0
they contacted authorities and began the cleanup process -- including hauling away the chemical still in the tank and vacuuming up some in the nearby ground			2
" we have mitigated the risk , we believe , in terms of further material leaving this facility , " said the head of @entity81 , which supplies products for the coal - mining industry			0
@entity242 said he could n't say how much of 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol -- which @entity280 spokesman @entity279 explained is used to wash coal before it goes to market -- leaked , only that it was under 35,000 gallons			0
@entity13 said a maximum of 5,000 gallons of the chemical seeped out			0
the @entity81 president downplayed the chemical 's health effects , saying it has " very , very low toxicity " and opining it poses no danger to the public			2
@entity87 and government officials have a different take , as evidenced by the stop - use warning			0
as @entity299 said , " we do n't know that the water is not safe , but i ca n't say it is safe			2
" the federal @entity301 -- which does n't yet have an " official role " in the response -- has taken no enforcement actions against @entity81 during the past five years , agency spokeswoman @entity300 said			0
@entity43 's @entity72 ordered @entity248 to take everything out of its 11 remaining above - ground storage tanks			1
this came hours after the department issued a " cease operations order " for the company , saying it could not receive any additional material until it addresses the effects of the leak and proves its structures are sound			1
' i do not know how long this will last ' the rush now is on to fully assess and address the problem , and perhaps press criminal charges because of it			0
having declared a state of emergency affecting the nine involved counties , @entity13 urged @entity323 to look out for one another -- especially small children and the elderly			2
to that point , he announced a " call to action drive " through friday evening at the @entity328 to collect items such as bottled water , sanitizer , liquid baby formula , paper and plastic plates and utensils for those in need			2
this is in addition to water stations set up in malls , churches , high schools , recreation centers and fire departments			2
the federal government has gotten involved as well , with president @entity346 signed an emergency declaration authorizing the @entity348 to coordinate disaster relief efforts			0
@entity348 said friday that it was sending 75 trucks -- each carrying about 4,900 gallons of water -- to the area			2
@entity13 said this federal help -- for now , mostly in the form of cases of bottled water -- is helpful , as are the contributions from many donating businesses			0
@entity361 attorney @entity360 said he and other federal authorities is looking into what happened , telling @entity0 friday that " even a negligent release of this kind could be a criminal violation			0
" " it 's really too early to tell whether criminal charges could be brought " against @entity248 , he said friday			0
" ... we 're going to want to figure out just exactly what occurred and when ... but right now , obviously , what we 're trying to do is get people 's water back on			1
" meanwhile , @entity87 is working intently as well , including teaming with @entity374 and the @entity375 to determine the contamination level			0
@entity377 said the system would be flushed and may be returned to service in zones , but she would not speculate when that might occur			0
the water company also has provided 12 tanker trucks filled with water , and bought four tractor - trailer loads of bottled water for distribution to those in need , @entity107 said			1
@entity13 noted that " there is no shortage of bottled water , " but urged people to see a doctor immediately if they come down with nausea , dizziness , or eye or skin irritation			1
and he did n't make any promises as to when this emergency would end			0
" i do not know how long this will last , " the governor said			0
