-- from a small apartment in @entity5 , @entity3 exile @entity1 is trying to bring news from his country to the world			1
using a network of @entity3 journalists and eager volunteers back in @entity13 , the 27 - year - old former student collates reports , pictures and video for his web site astreetjournalist.com			1
having fled @entity3 following the june demonstrations , @entity19 set up the site in november -- his latest attempt to beat what he says are government hackers and offer news and views about the unrest in @entity3			1
with international media operating under restrictions in @entity3 , independent journalists using blogs and social networking sites have become an important source of information			1
" what 's happening in @entity3 is not being reflected globally			1
we want to let the world know and let the state know that the world is watching , " said @entity1			1
during the deadly street demonstrations in @entity13 on december 27 , @entity19 said his web site had 17 million hits in two days			1
the site , which is maintained by about 12 volunteers , wobbled and slowed down , but stayed up and running			0
" we 've already experienced a large number of viewers on our blogs and web sites and therefore we have been hacked by the regime of @entity3 repeatedly and unfortunately have lost access to many of our web sites			2
but introducing this web site ( to ) professional colleagues and also lots of viewers who are currently collaborating with us has helped in achieving wonderful results in the past few days			2
" @entity19 believes in the power of social media			0
he is active on @entity59 and @entity60 and maintains a blog called @entity62			0
" @entity59 and @entity60 have turned into a strong tool for people in spreading news			2
citizen journalists have the most effect on news and today we clearly see that each citizen in @entity3 is acting as a media			1
therefore we have the responsibility in gathering the news in one place to achieve a better result against the regime 's censorship , " he said			2
@entity1 , who says he was expelled in 2008 from @entity79 in @entity13 because of his political views , took part in the june protests and distributed underground newspapers as an independent demonstrator , rather than a supporter of opposition leader @entity86			1
deciding that he needed to leave @entity3 to pursue his politics , he says he went first to @entity88 before arriving in @entity89 as a " political refugee " and quickly connecting with an ex-pat @entity3 community in @entity5			2
he now works long hours collating information for his web site			0
meanwhile , @entity19 worries about his parents , brother and sister in @entity13			0
he says his brother was recently arrested			0
he communicates with his family using multiple email accounts while his parents use public phones to minimize the risk of the call being traced			0
and he acknowledges that his network of correspondents in @entity3 , which he says is spreading to cities beyond @entity13 , contact him in the full knowledge that they could attract the attention of the authorities			1
" they could track the ip addresses and this could cause problems in the workplace or university			0
" @entity19 says eight of the people he has worked with in the past are currently in jail			0
assessing the latest street demonstrations , @entity19 says the protest movement is fragmented with diverse demands but there is a groundswell of public opinion that wants a new secular government			0
" it 's important that a leadership emerges as quickly as possible otherwise it might all die down			0

@entity131 's network is getting news out of @entity3 and onto the internet
in two days after december 27 *violence* , he said he had 17 million hits
@entity1 left @entity3 after taking part in protests in june
