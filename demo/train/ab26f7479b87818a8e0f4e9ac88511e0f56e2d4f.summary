-- power - sharing talks in @entity2 have stalled , with the government and main opposition parties unable to agree on the distribution of ministries			1
a women holds a sign inside a @entity10 hotel where power - sharing talks took place thursday			1
just one day earlier , there were reports that president @entity15 's ruling @entity14 and the opposition @entity16 ( @entity16 ) were close to reaching an agreement			1
but that fell apart thursday			0
" we 've reached a deadlock on the issue of allocating ministries , therefore we 've referred the issue to the facilitator hoping that he finds creative ways of unlocking that deadlock , " said @entity16 spokesman , @entity19			0
" we are hoping that tomorrow the process will continue to try and find a resolution to the outstanding issues			0
" @entity15 acknowledged that the negotiations have stalled			1
" we are hopeful for a breakthrough , " he said			0
" the @entity16 has their position , and we have ours			0
" what we need is a compromise on both sides			0
" it was reported wednesday that the @entity14 would oversee the @entity39 , while the @entity16 would control the @entity40			0
@entity15 sounded confident at the conclusion of wednesday 's negotiations , saying : " we finish tomorrow			2
" but @entity16 leader @entity43 was cautious			2
" the proceedings have been going on quite circuitously , but we have not concluded , " he said			0
both parties said they would consider the deal overnight			2
however , @entity16 spokesman @entity19 said thursday that the two sides were deadlocked			0
" there has been some movement , but not enough to seal the deal , " he said			2
it also appeared that more ministries remained on the table than had been indicated wednesday			0
" what we seek is to achieve an equal distribution of the key ministries and responsibilities for the sake of giving the deal a chance , " @entity19 said			2
" it is not on just @entity40			0
they range up to 10 : @entity65			0
" the allocation of government ministries had emerged as the latest hurdle in efforts to sort out the power - sharing deal signed by @entity15 and @entity43 on september 15			1
the deal allowed @entity15 to retain his office while making @entity43 the prime minister			1
@entity74 , head of an @entity16 splinter group , became deputy prime minister			0
the two sides were sorting out the distribution of @entity80 posts last saturday , when the state - run newspaper published what it said was the official list			2
that list gave key government ministries to the @entity14 , including defense , @entity88 , foreign affairs and @entity39			2
the @entity16 said it had not agreed to the selections , but a @entity14 spokesman said all parties had given their approval			0
former @entity96 president @entity95 , who mediated talks to reach the power - sharing deal , arrived in @entity2 on monday to participate in the negotiations			1
media reports wednesday had suggested the talks were stalled because @entity15 wants to shield his generals -- accused of election violence earlier this year -- from prosecution			1
giving @entity14 control of the @entity106 would ensure no generals are tried , and the @entity16 has assured @entity15 they will not go after those allegedly responsible for the violence , according to another @entity0 source			1
of the other ministries , @entity14 was fighting hardest to retain finance , sources told @entity0			0
they said the party fears that if the @entity16 controls that ministry , it could audit how money has been spent by @entity15 's government			2
it is widely believed that the government misappropriated funds and used the public purse for itself , enriching party loyalists with government contracts and neglecting to develop the economy , which has all but collapsed			0
@entity14 would let go of finance only if the @entity16 promised not to investigate how government money was used in the past , the sources said			0
the contention around the home affairs portfolio is more complex			1
@entity15 had suggested that @entity14 and @entity16 share that ministry , with each party having control for six months			1
for years , the home affairs portfolio has been under the control of a key @entity15 ally , a @entity14 faction called @entity137 that has helped @entity15 retain influence in @entity139 , an area where the president is hated			1
@entity15 fears giving home affairs to the @entity16 will alienate @entity137 members , causing them to join the opposition and further weakening the ruling party			1
home affairs also controls the voter rolls , which @entity15 's government has been accused of manipulating			1
the recent disputes threatened the power - sharing agreement , which was to end months of turmoil and violence after the country 's presidential election in march			1
@entity43 garnered the most votes but did not win enough to avoid a runoff with @entity15 , who has ruled the country since independence from @entity158 in 1980			1
the @entity16 leader withdrew days before the june 27 runoff , alleging that @entity15 's supporters had waged a campaign of violence and intimidation against opposition supporters			1
@entity0 's @entity166 contributed to this report .			0
