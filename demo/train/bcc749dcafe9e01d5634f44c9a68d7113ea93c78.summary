-- @entity1 is not @entity2 , because the @entity3 is not @entity4			1
in case this is not obvious to those camping out near @entity8 and in various other cities around the country , consider the following : in about 13 months , all 435 members of the @entity12 must stand for election			2
in addition , 33 @entity15 seats and residency at @entity17 will be up for grabs			2
and this is just at the federal level			2
so if the " @entity8 " crowd wants to peacefully overthrow the government , there is no need to gather in a public square			2
the demonstrators can work for a candidate or run themselves			1
unfortunately , those who are part of this movement seem to have dismissed this option			2
the @entity33 group has produced a manifesto of sorts , entitled a " @entity36 of @entity33			2
" among the grievances listed ( which they helpfully note are not " all - inclusive " ) is " that no true democracy is attainable when the process is determined by economic power			1
" so are we to conclude that since corporations control @entity3 politics , the best thing for us to do is to sit outside in a park and issue manifestos ? writing in the pages of @entity0 , @entity52 chastises those of us who do n't understand the point of all this , explaining that @entity8 is " the product of the decentralized networked - era culture , it is less about victory than sustainability			1
it is not about one - pointedness , but inclusion and groping toward consensus			1
" well , in the @entity3 , groups made up of disparate individuals " network " themselves together to make collective decisions all the time			1
as for " victory " being exchanged for " sustainability , " how is it that these are interchangeable nouns ? political processes tend to be ongoing and aimed at " sustainability			0
" @entity75 does not just take a vote and then dissolve			0
" @entity77 , " as @entity52 terms it , is just a way of saying that we have reached a decision			0
it is probably not our first , and let 's hope , not our last			1
and though it is not always pretty , president @entity84 , @entity3 house speaker @entity85 and majority leader @entity86 spend most of their time " groping toward consensus			1
" they must do so , however , in the real world , where people disagree			0
but let 's get back to that idea about democracy not being possible because corporations run everything			1
this feeling , i think , is at the root of the @entity8 movement			0
now , no one is going to say that money does n't play a role in politics			1
it always has , and it always will			0
what does this mean ? well , if you want to influence the nation 's politics you have to raise money			1
in this sense , @entity52 is right to talk about how , in a networked and wired world , politics is different			0
it is now much cheaper to get your message out			0
where 20 years ago a candidate would have to raise hundreds or thousands of dollars to fund a mass mailing , voters are now just a mouse click away			0
not enough money to buy traditional advertising ? there is the @entity128 -- @entity129 and @entity130 , for example			0
@entity132 , hardly a favorite of corporate america , has managed to use this new technology to raise several million dollars in just a day			1
technology has leveled the political playing field			0
still , as they say about the lottery , you have to be in it to win it			0
so if you want to change @entity3 , you have to get in the game			1
but here 's the rub : occupations and rallies are fun			1
the rules are complex , and so are the voters			0
a gathering in the street has a lot in common with a party			0
running for office and working for a candidate is like a 9 to 5 job			1
and getting involved in the political process forces you out of your comfort zone			0
instead of hanging out with a few hundred -- or a few thousand -- people who basically agree with you , you have to confront and perhaps persuade those who do n't agree with you			2
in the process , however , you will learn more about democracy then you will at any teach - in			2
so my suggestion to occupy @entity8 and their affiliates throughout the country is to pay as much attention to their 15th amendment right to vote as they do to their 1st amendment right to peaceably assemble			0
in other words , get out of your sleeping bags and onto the ballot ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			1

@entity183 says if @entity186 want change , they should run for office
he says demonstrating in a park wo n't do anything about corporate power in @entity3
he says protesters want inclusion , consensus , but they have it ; it 's called democracy
@entity183 : rallies are fun ; running for office not as much . to change @entity3 , get in game
