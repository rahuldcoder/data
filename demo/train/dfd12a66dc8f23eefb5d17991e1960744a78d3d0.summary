-- our youngest child , @entity1 , was murdered on september 11 , 2001 , while attending a conference at @entity4 at the @entity5			1
he was 25 years old when he died			2
when the towers fell , we were in @entity7 , on vacation to celebrate @entity10 's 60th birthday			2
@entity1 , our daughter , @entity12 , and our son @entity13 and his wife , @entity15 , had all been with us for a week before flying back to the @entity16 on september 8			1
on the day of the attacks , we were terribly upset after hearing the news			2
but at first , we were not worried about our kids			2
@entity13 and @entity15 lived in @entity20			2
@entity12 lived in @entity21 but her job was nowhere near the @entity23			2
@entity1 worked in @entity24 for @entity25			1
but since he traveled throughout the city for his job , we became concerned			0
we desperately tried calling our kids but could not get a line out of @entity7			0
it was n't until late in the day that we learned from @entity13 that " @entity30 was there			0
" the next day , @entity32 , who became mayor two months later , called to tell us that @entity30 was dead			0
my world stopped , and it still is totally out of kilter			0
news : triple - amputee veteran gets ' smart ' home on september 11 not @entity1 ! @entity30 was all laughter and sunshine and love			1
he was n't uncomfortable kissing his mother or father in public , or hugging his sister for no reason at all			0
he and @entity13 traveled to fun places and laughed and laughed			0
not @entity1 -- he was too full of life			1
our mark on this @entity53 is our children			1
after his death , we knew we had to leave a mark that @entity1 existed and the world would be a better place because he lived			1
in searching for a way to honor his life , we learned that 1 billion people , almost one sixth of humanity , have directly experienced torture , terrorism or mass violence			1
victims are left with lifelong emotional wounds preventing them from leading productive lives			0
in @entity74 , the incidence of traumatic depression and ptsd exceeds that of hiv / aids , malaria and @entity78 combined			0
@entity1 loved life ; he was compassionate and caring			1
there was nothing we could do for @entity30 , but returning survivors to life in his name was the perfect memorial			0
in march 2003 , we created the @entity85			1
people often ask : " why are you dealing with traumatic depression and ptsd when there are so many greater problems in the world ? " our response is simple : billions of philanthropic dollars go into fighting @entity76 , malaria and poverty			1
but if people do n't care whether they live or die , they will not follow through with their medication regimens , walk that extra mile for potable water or take advantage of microfinance			1
if you can restore hope , a person is less likely to strap on dynamite and kill innocent people			1
opinion : 11 years after 9/11 : who are the terrorists ? our foundation started by training indigenous health workers , but we quickly learned that training by itself was not sufficient			2
we needed to provide a framework in which professionals could work			2
to that end , our foundation runs eight trauma clinics in @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120			0
establishing public - private partnerships with local governments , our foundation trains , supervises and pays its staff ; the government provides clinic space , in - patient beds and psychotropic drugs			0
our foundation 's average annual cost per clinic is $ 30,000			0
more than 30,000 children have been abducted in @entity118 , and many of our patients are child soldiers , like @entity136			0
he has been treated in our @entity139 clinic for two years			0
now he no longer has nightmares or flashbacks			0
he can sleep through the night and hold down a job			0
he no longer thinks of suicide			0
he has even named his new baby after his counselor at the clinic			0
our foundation sponsors an annual @entity150 training conference on traumatic depression			0
watch : the @entity153 's talk to @entity154 at july 's fifth annual conference in @entity156 , attended by 500 mental health professionals from 22 countries , an imam from @entity160 rose to say the opening prayer			1
when translated , we learned that he had said a prayer for @entity1			1
tears streamed down my face as i realized we were truly on the way to leaving that mark for @entity1			1
the work has kept us functioning and given us a reason to get out of bed every day			2
nothing can erase our pain , but our passion to leave a profound and indelible mark that @entity1 existed on this @entity53 has propelled us forward			1
@entity1 would be very proud of the foundation that bears his name			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 and @entity153 .			1

@entity182 and @entity153 : our youngest son , @entity1 , was killed on 9/11
after his death , they knew they had to leave a mark that @entity1 existed
they set up the @entity85 to help people *affected* by terrorism
@entity182 , @entity153 : @entity1 would be proud of the work that bears his name
