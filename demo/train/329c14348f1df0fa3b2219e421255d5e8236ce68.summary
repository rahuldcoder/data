-- amid the whine of @entity3 engines and the clatter of pneumatic tools , 21 - year - old @entity6 -- one of mainland @entity9 's small but growing pack of motor racing drivers -- considers his form for the next day 's racing at the @entity13			1
" my time was n't very good and there were three corners we kept missing , " he tells @entity0 from the relative calm of the @entity16 's catering tent			1
" if i solve those three corners , i 'll be two seconds off the pace			0
" as the first @entity3 racer from mainland @entity9 to enter the @entity24 fixture - roundly regarded as the sport 's toughest training ground for @entity28 drivers -- @entity6 has a lot resting on his young shoulders			1
" of course , all @entity3 drivers want to be @entity28 drivers and @entity24 is like doing college , " he says , adding that his ambition is to become @entity9 's first @entity28 driver at a @entity33 ( @entity33 ) - sanctioned event			1
" most older drivers have done three or four years and then they graduate to @entity28			1
i hope i 'll be first			0
i have driven in @entity39 and nothing can compare with it -- it 's in a different category , " he says			0
as the reigning @entity44 series champion , fourth place - getter in the final 2012 @entity46 and this year 's national champion in the @entity3 , @entity6 has already shown the kind of form that could take him to the pinnacle of motor racing			1
at the moment , however , he needs all his concentration for @entity24 which he says is one of the most challenging circuits in the world			1
even at the tender age of 21 , he says the rigors of the track leave him exhausted at the end of the day 's racing			2
" physically i 'm okay but mentally i 'm very tired because you 're not just driving the car - it 's not like qualifying or practice -- when you race you have to try to overtake , you have to try to defend , you need to think about a lot of things in a very short space of time			0
" when you take risks , it 's not like you can just do that blindly , " he says			0
" you have to think , ' okay well ... i have a 60 - 70 % chance i 'm going to go for it			0
' " as a street circuit , the concrete canyons of @entity24 's @entity77 can throw up some chilling moments , even for experienced drivers who take some corners at upwards of 240 kph ( 150 mph ) on each lap. " you have to really push every corner and every lap during the race because the older drivers , the pace that they keep up is incredible , " @entity6 says			1
" they are preparing for @entity28 races so they ca n't make mistakes -- they 're not just fast on one lap , they 're fast on every corner and every lap. " i have done endurance races where you have a lot of time to take a rest ; you 're not competing with the car next to you			2
but in @entity3 , once you start , it 's a fight to the end			2
" when i start , i take a breath when the right light goes off and i push and push until the checkered flag comes down and then i let that breath out -- it really does feel like that			0
" with 15 laps at around two minutes a lap , 30 minutes might seem like a long time to hold your breath but , as @entity6 explains , @entity24 is that kind of circuit			1
" on other tracks , there 's a white line on both sides of the circuit -- if you take a short cut and your four wheels go over the white line , then that 's a penalty , " he says			0
" but in @entity24 , the white line is a wall -- not even two wheels can go over ; it 's really difficult			2
" @entity123 team manager @entity122 says his team has had some hair - raising moments at the @entity13 in the past			2
" crashes ? oh @entity127 yeah			0
huge ones , " says @entity122 amid the drone of the @entity3 garage			2
" this is the toughest circuit in the world bar none -- it 's probably one of the longest circuits with 23 or 24 corners and parts of it are like putting cotton through a needle			0
the good drivers , he says , will always stand out			0
" good experienced drivers are always up the front and new drivers are always at the back			0
new drivers need experience so they come back two or three times but if you do succeed at @entity24 , then all the @entity28 people are watching -- it 's a calling card for your career			1
" his team currently holds the record for the highest speed ever attained at @entity24 at 182 mph ( 292 kph ) which through the narrow historic streets of the former @entity160 colony is about as fast as it gets			1
" to put it in perspective , they do n't reach those sorts of speeds at @entity171 , " says @entity122 , adding that intense concentration is fundamental to every driver 's survival at @entity24			2
" as soon as the driver feels they 're safe , they 're in the morgue , " he says			0
while advances in the carbon fiber monocoque design have made the racers safer than they were 20 , and even 10 years ago ( @entity3 racers now fitted with thick panels that protect drivers from intrusions into the cockpit ) , the last thing a driver wants is ' to go in ' , says @entity122 using the pit vernacular for having a crash			1
" it 's still a dangerous sport and it still hurts when you go in , but the cars are among the safest in the world			0
" for @entity122 , @entity3 -- as the poor man 's @entity28 -- represents the real , gritty spirit of motor racing in its purest form			1
" here we 're dealing with raw talent , " he says			0
" the @entity28 drivers always remember @entity3 because there 's this fantastic bonding that goes on because they work with a small team			1
" in @entity28 , the mechanics would n't even speak with the drivers , but here they eat , drink and sleep with the team			1
it 's really the university of racing			0

he aims to graduate to *f1* racing to become first @entity9 to compete *internationally*
@entity13 regarded as one of the toughest training grounds for future @entity28 drivers
