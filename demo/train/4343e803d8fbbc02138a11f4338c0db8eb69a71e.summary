-- jurors who convicted a man of three murders in a 2007 @entity5 home invasion and recommended he be put to death for his crimes said tuesday that serving on the case changed their lives -- and took an emotional and sometimes physical toll			1
" this has strengthened my faith , " @entity11 told in session on the @entity14 network			2
" we all came together			2
it was amazing , how it worked out , and we came to the right decision			1
i know that this is , for me , @entity22 's plan , and i think i 'm honored to be a part of that			2
" jurors recommended monday that @entity26 , 47 , should die for his role in the 2007 invasion of a home in @entity30 , @entity5 , that left @entity26 , 48 , dead along with her daughters , 17 - year - old @entity26 and 11 - year - old @entity26			1
they earlier convicted @entity26 on a list of charges , including murder , capital murder and kidnapping			1
prosecutors alleged @entity26 and co-defendant @entity26 invaded the home of dr. @entity26 on july 23 , 2007 , beat and tied up @entity42 , raped and strangled @entity42 , molested one of their daughters and set the house on fire before attempting to flee			1
the two daughters , who had been tied to their beds , died of smoke inhalation			2
@entity26 also forced @entity42 to go to a bank and withdraw $ 15,000 from an account after finding evidence the account held between $ 20,000 and $ 30,000 , authorities said			1
@entity55 is to be tried separately later			2
@entity56 , @entity42 's sister , said tuesday she does not believe closure can ever exist in a case like this			1
" i think justice has been served , but i do n't know that there truly is anything just , when something like this happens , " she said			2
the brutality of the case sent shock waves through @entity5 and beyond			1
@entity11 and juror @entity68 said they were haunted by pictures they viewed -- especially pictures of the @entity73 daughters			1
" i have a 10 - year - old daughter at home , " @entity68 said			1
" ... @entity76 was the one factor , for me , that i could not get over			2
" he said he was plagued by a recurring nightmare in which an 11 - year - old girl was " screaming for my help , and i 'm not able to help her			2
" " that is burned in my memory , those pictures of those girls , " @entity11 said			0
she said during the trial , " i thought i was doing really well			0
and we gave our guilty verdict , and i went home and just collapsed			1
i was sick for a week and a half			0
" she said she focused on taking care of herself during the penalty phase			0
" it takes a toll on your body you do n't even realize , " she said			1
both jurors said it was hard not being able to talk about the case with their families or even each other during the trial			1
and they said they were struck by the fact that @entity26 remained stoic and showed no remorse			1
" he 's an empty shell ... hollow eyes and an empty shell , " @entity11 said			0
but she said she was able to view @entity26 more as a human being after his defense attorneys moved him closer to the jury			1
" that really affected me , " she said			0
" i had never seen him that close			0
" both said the jury took the case and their responsibility very seriously			1
but both maintained that @entity26 should never again walk free			1
@entity68 said it was important to him that @entity26 receive the death penalty because " i knew that he would be in a cell by himself , secluded ... that 's what he hated			1
" if jurors had recommended @entity26 be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole , " he would have been in general population , " @entity68 said			1
" that 's what he liked			0
that 's what he was used to			0
" a third juror , @entity138 , said : " if he had life in prison , that would be going home for him			1
" @entity26 has been in and out of the criminal justice system since he was 17 years old for a laundry - list of offenses			1
@entity68 said he had difficulty viewing @entity26 as a person and not just a perpetrator , but maintained that everyone deserves a fair trial -- and that @entity26 got one			1
those outside the jury room wondered why jurors took their time to decide on the death penalty , @entity11 and @entity68 said -- their verdict came on the fourth day of deliberation			2
but " we wanted to make sure everybody was comfortable with the decision , " @entity68 said			2
" this is a huge deal , " @entity11 said			0
" everybody needed their own time			0
" " i have a very spiritual background , and i thought that this would be the only opportunity for this man to ever make peace with his @entity22 , if he even has one , " or to accept responsibility , @entity11 said			0
she felt the death penalty was necessary for @entity26 to accept responsibility or experience remorse			1
@entity138 said the jurors had some trouble sorting out the paperwork and procedures , but likewise stressed the significance of their decision			1
" all 12 of us tried to keep our emotions in check because we knew that we had to make a decision here on a man 's life			1
and it was very very difficult for us , " she said			0
both @entity11 and @entity68 said they did not buy the defense 's claim that @entity26 was merely a follower and @entity190 said			1
" he 's a man , and he made his choices			0
unfortunately , they were the wrong ones			0
... he needs to be accountable			0
" the ringleader of the crime , saying that @entity26 had plenty of opportunities to make different choices , to stop or to leave , and did not			1
" calling him a follower is just too easy , " @entity68 said he did not believe testimony that @entity55 triggered @entity26 ' rage by telling him , when he returned from the bank with @entity42 , that the girls were dead			1
a police officer who interviewed @entity26 just after his arrest testified that @entity26 told him he saw @entity76 upon his return and saw that she had changed clothes , @entity68 pointed out			1
asked about whether they were overcome by emotion at times , @entity11 said , " oh , several times			0
i do n't think any of us expected it when it did overcome us			0
" looking at the bank video of @entity42 was particularly hard , she said , as jurors knew the woman was being brave and doing what she felt she had to do to save her family			2
" she had no idea what she was walking into , " @entity11 said			0
" no one could have known			0
and all three of those girls were , i think , very brave in their final moments			0
they did n't deserve this			0
" " it was a very emotional case and a very emotional two months , " @entity68 said			1
but he praised the other jurors for following the letter of the law and conducting civilized deliberations			2
" there was never a shouting match , " he said			0
" there was never insults			0
" both @entity11 and @entity68 said they felt privileged to have served alongside the others			0
" we worked extremely hard , " @entity68 said			0
jurors also praised the @entity42 family , saying they spoke to @entity26 and others after the trial			1
" it was so wonderful to hug these people , " @entity11 said , " and they treated us like family , and we feel almost like family because we 've seen such intimate things of their life and lived some things with them , and they are the most wonderful people that i think i 've come across in a long time			2
" @entity68 said he was struck by the @entity42 family telling jurors they were sorry the panel had to go through such an experience			2
" this family is so dignified , gracious , classy , " he said			0
@entity26 " held his head high throughout this entire case , " he said			1
" ... he was an inspiration to all of us			0
" the @entity42 family had said they were praying for the jurors			2
" it 's amazing to me that in the midst of their horror and grief they are so generous to think about praying for us , there in the midst of this horror			0
it 's heartwarming , " @entity11 said			0
" ... i ca n't even put it to words			0
" @entity11 said she plans to attend @entity55 's trial because she wants to support the @entity42 family			0
jurors acknowledged that it is likely their lives will never be the same			2
@entity68 said he thought he would be all right because he 's seen movies and television , but he found it 's different when something actually took place			0
" you want to feel safe in your home , " he said , but " ... there 's more people like this out there			2
