-- after last weekend 's record - breaking pre-valentine 's day frame , @entity1 is feeling hopeful about box office prospects during the upcoming holiday weekend , which will include four days of box office receipts			1
we 're likely headed another frame of four $ 20 + million grosses -- possibly even five ! three new movies are hitting theaters -- action sequel " ghost rider : spirit of @entity17 , " romantic comedy " @entity18 , " and animated import " @entity19 " -- but " @entity20 " wo n't relinquish the top spot so easily			1
here are my predictions for the four day holiday weekend : 1			1
" @entity20 " -- $ 30 million last weekend 's romantic victor has played well throughout the week -- it broke midweek records with its $ 11.6 million @entity28 haul -- and according to @entity29 , " @entity20 " is still this weekend 's number one choice , accounting for 17 percent of thursday 's ticket sales -- the most of any film ( " ghost rider " accounted for just 5 percent )			1
it seems that the poorly - reviewed film has become something of an event film for women -- it may not be totally well received , but people want to see it because their friends have			0
" @entity20 " may fall by about 25 - 30 percent over the long weekend and take in another $ 30 million			1
" ghost rider : @entity44 " -- $ 29.5 million not many people thought that the original " @entity43 , " which hit theaters over this very weekend in 2007 , would earn a sequel			2
that film grossed just $ 115.8 million against its $ 110 production budget ( a figure that does not include marketing costs ) , but apparently , its $ 228.7 million global haul was enough for @entity53 to greenlight a second film			1
@entity55 is back as the flame - headed comic book character for " @entity44 , " which cost somewhere in the mid- $ 70 million range to produce			0
the presence of @entity60 ticket prices should add a few million dollars to " @entity44 's " opening , but because of the tepid reactions to the original " @entity43 , " which opened with $ 52 million in its first four days , it 's unlikely that this one will fare better			0
the film might ride away with a bit less than $ 30 million			2
" @entity66 " -- $ 27 million the @entity69 / @entity68 action flick should ride its " a- " @entity71 grade to a successful second weekend			2
direct competition from " @entity43 " may result in a slightly inflated 35 percent drop over four days , which would give " @entity66 " a terrific $ 27 million			0
" @entity75 : the @entity76 " -- $ 26 million more than any other film , " journey " will benefit from the holiday weekend			1
the 3 - d sequel remains the top choice for families , many of whom will be eager to keep their youngsters busy over the extended weekend			0
a tiny 5 percent drop would give the $ 79 million adventure a robust $ 26 million , lifting its total to $ 59 million after ten days			0
" @entity18 " -- $ 17 million @entity89 's last romantic comedy , " @entity90 , " was a critical disaster that crashed and burned at the box office , taking in a measly $ 30.2 million against a $ 120 million budget			1
thankfully , " @entity18 , " which features " @entity94 's " @entity95 and " @entity97 's " @entity96 alongside @entity89 , will fare better			0
granted , the film 's breakout potential has been severely reduced by the complete box office dominance of " the vow , " which will steal away female audiences , but on a busy weekend , " war " could still find a decent crowd -- it drew about $ 1.7 million on @entity28 sneaks			1
@entity105 spent $ 65 million on the action - comedy , which will play in 3,189 theaters this weekend , and it seems headed for about $ 17 million			2
way further down the chart , @entity111 's latest , " @entity19 , " which is being distributed by @entity114 , will follow in the footsteps of his most recent entry , " @entity113 , " which earned $ 15 million in 2009			0
playing in 1,522 theaters , it may take in $ 5 million this weekend			0
