every group of people has a right to its own views , @entity3 said , and that diversity should be respected , " but when it comes to how the state treats people -- how the law treats people -- i believe that everybody has to be treated equal			2
" he spoke at a news conference with president @entity24 of @entity1 , a country in which homosexuality is illegal			1
" regardless of race , regardless of religion , regardless of gender , regardless of sexual orientation ... people should be treated equally , and that 's a principle that i think applies universally , " @entity3 said			2

people are not refused jobs for being gay , he said			0
" but we are still not ready to decriminalize homosexuality			0
" " but of course this does not mean that we are all homophobic , " @entity24 insisted			0
@entity24 then turned to another issue on which the two nations differ : capital punishment			0
" in our country , we have abolished it for many years , " he said , adding , " we do respect the choice of each country			0

the decision was " not simply a victory for the lgbt community , " he said , referring to lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people			0
" i think it was a victory for @entity4 democracy			2
" " i believe at the root of who we are as a people , as @entity4 , is the basic precept that we are all equal under the law			0
we believe in basic fairness			0
and what i think yesterday 's ruling signifies is one more step towards ensuring that those basic principles apply to everybody , " @entity3 said in response to a question from @entity2 's @entity108			2
his administration will now have to comb through every federal statute , he said , to ensure that federal benefits " apply to all married couples			0
" there are complexities , he noted			0
since some states recognize same - sex marriages and others do n't , the government will need to determine whether a same - sex couple remains married under federal law after moving to a state that does not recognize the marriage			0

" @entity129 " is a personal hero " and " a hero for the world , " @entity3 said			1
" and if and when he passes from this place , one thing i think we 'll all know is that his legacy is one that will linger on throughout the ages			2

he called the trip a " powerful " reminder that " we have to remain vigilant when it comes to the defense of human rights			1
... this is a testament to when we 're not vigilant in defense of human rights , what can happen			1
" " obviously , for an @entity180 , an @entity43 - @entity4 president , to be able to visit this site , i think , gives me even greater motivation in terms of human rights around the world , " @entity3 said			1
