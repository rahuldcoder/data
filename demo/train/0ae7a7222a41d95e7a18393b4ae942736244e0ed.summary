-- this is a moment of terrible tragedy for @entity3 and people of goodwill everywhere following the discovery of the bodies of three teenagers who were abducted and killed while hitchhiking in the @entity9			1
it is also a moment of high danger			2
when an entire nation -- and the entirety of the @entity17 people -- is stunned and in deep mourning , it might be understandable that some among us would call for retribution			1
understandable -- but not necessarily wise			2
what we need is justice and to avoid a downward spiral of violence , not retribution			2
in the @entity17 world , we are all hurting right now , all angry			2
it is as if we have all suffered a death in our own family			0
those of us who are parents are imagining how we would feel if the victims had been our children			0
the funerals of the three teens were unbearably sad			1
as finance minister @entity37 said at the funeral procession of @entity39 , " let us remember that today we are burying a child			0
we are burying a child , who could have also been ours , and therefore he is also ours			0
we are not burying a settler or a soldier in the inevitable battle for this land			0
" opinion : teens ' killing hurts @entity3 , bad for @entity50 at a time like this , it is more important than ever to remember our heritage and our values			1
" justice , justice , shall you pursue , " declares the @entity56 16:20			0
justice means finding those responsible and punishing them to the full extent of the law			0
it also means tracking down anyone who enabled them by planning this operation or by hiding the perpetrators or helping them escape			0
if they acted on orders from the highest levels of @entity74 , as @entity3 prime minister @entity75 has said , they too should be held accountable			1
but justice also means not punishing those who were not responsible			0
measures that simply make more miserable the lives of the 1.7 million people who live in @entity81 and whose lives are already very tenuous should be avoided			1
the same applies for the 2.2 million people who live in the @entity9			2
@entity3 's government doubtless feels a need to provide a tough response , partly to re-establish a deterrence against such heinous acts , partly to satisfy the demands of its own grieving people			1
it should resist the temptation to act just for the sake of acting or from entering into a violent escalation with @entity74			0
@entity3 is justified in responding to rocket attacks from @entity81 but should avoid any offensive that would put millions of civilians , both @entity3 and @entity50 , in the firing line			1
the @entity3 army 's demolition of the family homes of two named suspects without any due process is an unwelcome return to a policy that @entity3 abandoned in 2005			1
as a deterrence , it has never succeeded in the past			2
it is simply a way of punishing people who happen to be related to suspected terrorists			2
worst of all would be to react as @entity3 has responded so many times in the past by announcing a massive new expansion of settlements			1
defense minister @entity119 has already suggested building a new settlement in memory of the teenagers			0
not only would this lose @entity3 the world 's sympathy , it would also weaken the @entity126 and @entity50 president @entity127 , who has been a welcome voice for reason and moderation and whose security forces have maintained cooperation with the @entity133 throughout the crisis			1
additionally , it would drive another stake into the heart of the two - state solution -- which remains the only sane and just way of resolving the @entity3 - @entity50 conflict			1
until that conflict is ended through negotiations , tragically we will see more horrific acts of violence and more martyrs on both sides			0
we are seeing some of the consequences of the collapse of secretary of state @entity150 's peace initiative in april			0
the absence of any movement toward peace has created a vacuum in which extremism can flourish			0
that 's why it is so important for the @entity158 not to walk away , but to remain engaged with both parties			0
this could be a decisive turning point for both @entity3 and @entity50			1
if @entity3 undertakes targeted measures designed to punish those responsible for this terrible crime , the world will be with it , and the crisis will be surmounted			1
if it turns its understandable anger into a general offensive , we could be in for a sustained period of violence claiming the lives of more innocent people on both sides			1
@entity37 , the finance minister , expressed the right policy : " we will find those responsible and we will punish them			2
the real revenge is our ability to bridge the gaps within us			0
" @entity3 pm at teens ' funeral : ' broad moral gulf ' between us , enemy the @entity3 teens killed : promising lives , grieving families			1

deaths of three teens a terrible tragedy for @entity3 and people everywhere
@entity196 : punish the killers but not families , others in a general offensive
expanding settlements , *harming* families has never worked as a deterrence , he says
@entity196 : how @entity3 reacts will be decisive turning point for both @entity3 and @entity50
