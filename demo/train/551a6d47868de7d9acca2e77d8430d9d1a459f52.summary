the news that @entity1 adopted an @entity3 baby has fired up a debate regularly stoked by the likes of @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			2
and everyone has an opinion			0
in the @entity12 in 2010 , black children left the care system at a rate of 24 percent , while white children left at a rate of 43 percent , according to the @entity12 @entity17			1
in the @entity21 , where i live , a black child is three times less likely to be adopted from care than a white child			1
and until recently , @entity21 guidelines on adoption have made it difficult to adopt between races			1
but the policy is changing after @entity31 , the @entity21 's @entity29 said it was " outrageous " to deny a child the chance of adoption because " of a misguided belief that race is more important than any other factor			1
" in the @entity21 , a black child is three times less likely to be adopted from care than a white child			1
indeed , the @entity3 1994 @entity53 " affirms the prohibition against delaying or denying the placement of a child for adoption or foster care on the basis of race , color or national origin of the foster or adoptive parents or of the child involved			2
" read more : adopted kids ' drug abuse risk affected by biological family so , with it becoming ' easier ' to adopt a child from a different race -- does this make it right ? it is a controversial question that i 'm not going to seek to answer within the short confines of this article			1
however , my own experiences of living with a white @entity21 family have been positive and one can argue that this was because i still maintained contact with my birth family via visits to @entity72			1
but not every transracially fostered or adopted child 's experience is as positive			2
having spoken to adults who were fostered or adopted by different races in the past , i hear them speak with a deeply - embedded emotional scar connected with feelings of detachment from their roots and holding onto inaccurate preconceived ideas about their culture			0
indeed , the culturally confused character of my latest novel ' @entity85 ' also embodies this detachment			0
@entity87 's adoptive white family had done everything a good family should do -- they 'd loved , protected and nurtured her - but never had that talk on race			1
and such a talk is crucial within a transracial adoption setting			1
in fact , such talks may be necessary frequently throughout the years			0
i am by no means an authority on cross-cultural or transracial adoption			1
it is an emotive and important subject			0
but whilst a positive outlook is important for anyone embarking on such a journey , the prospective adoptive parent will also need to acknowledge the negativity that could arise and make sure they do n't shy away from confronting it			0
you ca n't behave like the mother in my book , who brushes off her daughter @entity87 's questions after the child is racially abused in the street by saying , " i have ginger hair -- i 'm also different			2
" so , as a multitude of @entity119 stars and average folk seek to adopt children cross racially , the question moves away from the " right and wrongs , " and then becomes : " how best to do it ? " in 2008 , the @entity124 in @entity125 released a study that suggested foster parents of minority children should receive special training and preparation for the challenges inherent in interracial foster care			2
prospective parents may want to consider the following : openly confronting racism carefully examining their own beliefs and attitudes surrounding race and ethnicity educating themselves on skin and hair maintenance for the child include in the family , cultural traditions , customs and foods of the child 's origin			2
living within a multicultural community and allowing the child to attend a racially mixed school			0
this all might seem a lot			0
and it is ! plus there are no guarantees at the end of it			0
but it is important and it should be- - some say parenting is the most important job in the world ! see also : @entity167 parenting fails of 2011 there is no denying adoption is an emotional subject			0
but the readiness of any adult to make such a selfless commitment to a child , is an act that should be commended and viewed fairly -- whatever their culture or race .			0
