-- the @entity1 are enduring the worst floods since records began 120 years ago			1
the situation is being exacerbated by the risk of landmines from the @entity8 war resurfacing			0
already 26 bodies have been recovered , and rescuers expect to find more as flood waters recede			1
even though the intense rainfall subsided monday , the disaster is far from over			0
@entity0 meteorologist @entity14 said flooding in the region will last at least another week -- and in some places , it could get worse			2
@entity18 is no stranger to heavy rain events : the low pressure system currently drenching the @entity1 was detached from the main weather pattern and is known as a " cutoff low			1
" this meteorological event has slowly dumped more than 100 millimeters of rain in only a few days , leaving rivers swollen and towns underwater			1
a cutoff low is similar to an eddy in the curve of a river that becomes isolated from the main current			1
like a curve in a river , a cutoff low begins as a dip ( trough ) in the winds known as the westerlies			1
when one of these eddies becomes cut off from the main westerly flow , the closed circulation can last for two to three days on average			2
in the case of last week , the cutoff low lasted up to four days and dumped two months ' worth of rain			1
during the first stage of a cutoff low , a deep trough of cold air will dip south resembling an upside - down omega - type shape in the jetstream			1
cold air will then start to encircle the low on the west side , as the warm humid air moves north along the east side of the low			2
eventually the warm air will wrap completely around , creating a pocket of cold air within the core of the low pressure system			1
the low will now drift slower than if it was a part of the main jetstream			2
over the course of an average of two to three days -- occasionally as much as 10 or more -- the low - pressure system will merge back with the jetstream as the next dip ( trough ) digs southward and picks up the cutoff low			1
the existence of a cutoff low pattern occurs most commonly in @entity18 , according to a 2004 study of cutoff low systems in the @entity79			1
other areas also mentioned in the study were the eastern @entity83 coast , the @entity84 and the @entity87 - @entity86 region			0
the effect of this weather system is exacerbated in the @entity1 , where rivers are used to move trade and goods			1
@entity94 anchor @entity93 explained how the region is affected			0
" @entity96 , for example , is landlocked			0
historically , the @entity98 and @entity99 rivers are the main commerce line to the @entity101 in the east and to the rest of @entity18 in the west			0
" rivers also supply hydrolectric power			0
you might think , more water means more power , but that is not necessarily the case			0
excessively high water levels -- just like extremely low levels -- affect the efficiency level and energy output			2
many smaller power stations are flooded -- some temporarily , while others are permanently damaged			0
" rivers in the @entity1 also represent the main supply of fresh water			2
" high water levels contaminate water treatment plants leaving thousands without drinking water , " @entity121 explained			0
water is also used for industry so factories , fisheries and agriculture are all affected by these floods , she added			0
