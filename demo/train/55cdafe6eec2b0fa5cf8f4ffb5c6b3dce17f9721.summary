-- divorce is almost always a messy business , but certain settlements between former beloveds can be somewhat absurd			1
here 's a look at some examples of offbeat divorce settlements			1
now that 's a breakup record @entity9 was a tremendous singer , but he was n't always so great at keeping track of his personal finances			1
he spent lavishly , which meant that he often could n't cover his bills			2
he was having particularly big trouble footing the bill for his 1977 divorce from @entity17 , so @entity19 's lawyer worked out a novel settlement : @entity19 would record a new album and give all of the royalties to @entity23 as alimony			1
@entity19 headed into the studio and recorded the double album " here , @entity28 " to fulfill this deal with @entity23			2
unfortunately for @entity23 , critics and audiences did n't love @entity19 's divorce - themed concept album ; although today 's critics praise the album , it was the singer 's worst charting record of the 1970s			1
do n't hassle his attorney , either as part of actor @entity38 's 2008 divorce settlement with ex-wife @entity39 , he got to keep total possession of the nickname " @entity38 " and the catchphrase " do n't hassle the @entity38			1

if only divorce lawyers had their own @entity46 @entity46 laureates may be some of the world 's smartest people , but even they can bungle their divorce settlements			1
take @entity51 , the 1995 winner of the economics prize			0
as part of his 1988 divorce settlement , his ex-wife got half of the funds from any future @entity46 win , so when @entity51 picked up the prize in 1995 , he forked over half of the cash to his ex. @entity51 must have been particularly irritated that the divorce settlement clause actually expired in 1995 , so if he had nabbed the @entity46 in 1996 he would n't have had to share his brainy booty			1
@entity63 could at least take comfort in knowing he was in good company			0
all of @entity67 's prize money from his 1921 win in physics went to his ex-wife , @entity70			2
at least this is equitable @entity73 couple @entity72 and @entity74 had been married for 18 years when they decided to part ways last year			0
@entity77 accused his wife of infidelity , so he decided to take the whole " splitting everything 50 - 50 " concept to its logical conclusion			2
@entity77 had his family come over and cut away half of the couple 's 20 ' x 24 ' house			2
while his wife 's half of the marital home remained standing , he deconstructed his own portion and carried the building supplies back to his parents ' home			1
man really gets his wife 's goat @entity99 @entity98 managed to get his ex-wife 's goat in their divorce			1
when @entity98 and his wife split , he ended up with her pet goat , which he now takes for daily walks through @entity109			1
let us now divide any shared organs earlier this year , @entity113 's dr. @entity112 made an odd request during his divorce : he wanted his allegedly unfaithful wife to return the kidney he 'd given her			1
dr. @entity112 gave his wife , @entity119 , a kidney in 2001 , and as part of the messy divorce he claimed that he would either like the organ or compensation of $ 1.5 million			1
legal scholars were skeptical of @entity112 's request given that a ) organ donation is legally a gift , not a loan and b ) losing her ex-husband 's kidney would have been ruinous for @entity134 's health			1
the court rejected @entity112 's claim earlier this year			2

better than hotel soaps when hotelier @entity141 married the younger @entity144 actress and beauty queen @entity142 in 1942 , the union raised some eyebrows			0
eventually , @entity142 got tired of @entity141 and began sleeping with her stepson , @entity146			0
@entity141 and @entity142 ended up divorcing in 1947 , and she picked up $ 275,000 in the process			0
@entity142 later joked , " @entity141 was very generous in the divorce settlement			1
he gave me 5,000 @entity152			0
writer keeps his ex close prolific @entity156 author @entity155 requested an odd stipulation in his 1949 divorce from his wife @entity159			1
@entity155 's ex got a large alimony , one she later said was comparable to a top executive 's salary during the 1950s , but she had to live no more than six miles away from @entity155 so he could always see his children			0
@entity166 ' timing just a little off in 1980 , @entity166 was in the process of divorcing his fourth wife , @entity169 , when he dropped dead from a sudden heart attack at the age of 54			2
unfortunately for @entity166 ' children , their father had n't gotten around to amending his will to reflect his cooling feelings for @entity177 , and the divorce was not yet finalized			2
as a result , @entity179 inherited @entity166 ' £ 4.5 million ( $ 7.3 million ) estate and the rights to all of his work , while the @entity166 children got a meager £ 750 ( $ 1,213 ) each			0
