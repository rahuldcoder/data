the @entity0 voted 3 - 2 thursday to consider lifting its ban on in - flight cell phone use			1
on the same day , the federal @entity3 and three members of @entity5 took steps to block those calls			1
secretary of transportation @entity8 said in a statement to @entity11 that he is looking into the possibility of banning in - flight calls , citing its aviation consumer protection authority			0
the @entity3 will determine whether allowing calls is " fair to consumers			0
" many people consider the idea of cell phone conversations annoying in the close confines of a plane , and some are casting it as a consumer rights issue			1
" over the past few weeks , we have heard of concerns raised by airlines , travelers , flight attendants , members of @entity5 and others who are all troubled over the idea of passengers talking on cell phones in flight -- and i am concerned about this possibility , as well , " @entity8 said			1
meanwhile , senator @entity37 ( @entity36 ) and senator @entity38 ( @entity39 ) introduced legislation on thursday to ban cell phone conversations on commercial airline flights			1
@entity44 rep. @entity43 , ( @entity45 ) has also introduced a bill that would prohibit in - flight voice communications but allow text messaging			0
those actions come as the @entity0 considers whether it should lift its decades - old ban on cell phones on aircraft			1
are the two government entities working at cross purposes ? perhaps			2
but each cites its individual and independent mandates			0
the @entity0 has banned in - flight calls for technical reasons			2
but new technology has made that ban obsolete , the commission says , and there 's no reason to continue it			2
the @entity3 , which includes the @entity65 , is entrusted with safe air travel , but also with protecting the rights of air travelers			0
phones on a plane : to talk or not to talk ? the @entity0 has been pelted with criticism in the last several weeks after the commission 's new chairman made the announcement			2
" i 'm the last person in the world who wants to listen to someone talking to me while i fly across the country , " @entity0 chairman @entity74 -- who proposed the change -- told a congressional panel thursday			2
" but we are the technical agency , and we will make the rules for the way the new technology works			0
" the current requirement that cell phones may not be used in - flight would actually be expanded to include all bands , said @entity74 , unless airlines install new on - board equipment that prevents interference with terrestrial networks			0
" the proposal would not require airlines to either install such equipment , or to offer mobile wireless services aboard their aircraft " he said			2
" @entity97 would be free , within the confines of the rules of the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) and @entity3 ( @entity3 ) , to make their own decisions			0
we simply propose that because new technology makes the old rule obsolete the @entity0 should get government out from between airlines and their passengers			2
" your view : would allowing cell phones on flights open @entity109 's chatterbox ? " if we move beyond what we do here today and actually update our rules to allow voice calls on planes we can see a future where our quiet time is monetized and seating in the silent section comes at a premium , " said @entity0 commissioner @entity112 , who voted in favor of the proposal			1
the @entity124 , a union that has been leading a campaign against cell phone calls in - flight , promised to continue lobbying against the proposal			1
" as the last line of defense in our nation 's aviation system , flight attendants understand the importance of maintaining a calm cabin environment , and passengers agree , " said @entity124 president @entity129 , in a statement			0
a @entity141 poll released wednesday indicates most @entity142 want silence when they fly , with 59 % saying they do n't want the use of cell phones on airplanes and only 30 % saying they are in favor of lifting the ban			1
a mute button is also a strong option among those polled			0
even a majority of tech - reliant younger respondents , ages 18 to 29 , are against using phones on planes -- 52 % opposed to 39 % in favor			0
the @entity0 is taking public input on the proposal , and an agency statement says officials will consider consumer and stakeholder opinion before taking any final action			1
the agency offers more information on its website , including a frequently asked questions ( faq ) and a means of filing comments online			0
rep. @entity43 told @entity11 that crying babies and snoozing adults cause enough commotion on flights , and cell phone calls will only make matters worse			1
" tap , do n't talk , " @entity43 said			0
opinion : phone calls on planes ? please , no ! what do you think of people using cell phones on airplanes ? please share your thoughts in the comments below or email us at @entity191 .			1

the @entity0 may allow cell phone usage on airplanes
another federal government agency might ban their use in aircraft
a new poll shows most people are against the proposal
texting , not talking , is the way to go , says one member of @entity5
