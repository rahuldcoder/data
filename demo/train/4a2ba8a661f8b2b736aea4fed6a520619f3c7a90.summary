-- echoing an airline chief and flight attendants , @entity2 rep. @entity1 came out saturday against the @entity6 's move to allow small pocketknives on airplanes , calling it unnecessary , counterproductive and potentially dangerous			1
in a letter to @entity6 administrator @entity13 , the @entity11 @entity10 expressed concern about the new policy and asked it be reversed			0
" the attacks on september 11 , 2001 , demonstrated that in the confined environment of an airplane , even a small blade in the hands of a terrorist can lead to disaster , " wrote @entity1 , who is running for the @entity24 seat recently vacated by @entity25			2
" ... in addition , the additional responsibility of assessing which knives meet the new requirements could be a distraction for already overburdened screeners at @entity6 checkpoints , potentially leading to increased wait times and decreased security			1
" knives on a plane ? really ? under the new rules outlined this week , knives with blades no longer than 2.36 inches ( 6 centimeters ) and less than a half - inch wide will be allowed in airline cabins as long as the blade is retractable and does not lock into place			0
razorblades and box cutters are still prohibited			0
the rules also allow passengers to carry two golf clubs , toy bats or other sports sticks -- such as ski poles , hockey sticks , lacrosse sticks and pool cues -- aboard in carry - on luggage			0
@entity13 said the move brings the @entity2 into alignment with international rules and are keeping with his " risk - based security " approach			2
@entity59 , who oversaw the @entity6 from 2005 to 2009 , said the search for knives interferes with the search for objects such as bombs and toxins that can threaten aircraft			2
@entity68 chief backs decision but others have sharply criticized the change , which takes effect april 25			1
they include the @entity73 , a nearly 90,000 - member group that has launched a campaign to reverse the @entity6 's decision			0
the policy is also opposed by the @entity78 , a union representing more than 26,000 officers from 65 agencies			0
and @entity82 ceo @entity81 said friday that he shares the same " legitimate concerns " as his flight attendants			1
@entity82 ceo opposed to allowing small knives on aircraft " if the purpose is to increase security checkpoint flow , there are much more effective steps we can take together to streamline the security checkpoints with risk - based screening mechanisms , " he wrote in a letter to @entity89 .			1

the @entity6 said it would allow small knives onto planes , starting april 25
the agency 's chief says this brings the @entity2 in *compliance* with world norms
@entity2 rep. @entity1 calls the move unnecessary and potentially dangerous
@entity82 's ceo , unions for flight attendants and *federal* *law* *enforcement* also oppose it
