-- for some 100 years , tourists have flocked @entity3 's ostrich family farm in @entity4 , the @entity5 city renowned as the ostrich capital of the world , to ride its long - legged , long - necked birds			1
today , however , @entity3 's @entity10 show farm is devoid of both birds and people after tests showed that a major avian flu outbreak in the region has infected his birds			1
as a result , all of @entity3 's 1,500 ostriches have been culled			1
" we do not have a business at this stage , our business is closed , " says @entity3 , whose farm has been empty eight months now			0
" tremendously frustrated -- it has been a battle of unanswered questions , it has been sleepless nights , it has been staff concerns , it has been financial concerns			0
we still do not have the green light so the sleepless nights and the frustration still carries on , " he adds			0
@entity3 is just one of the hundreds of @entity4 farmers facing tough times after the @entity36 virus was first detected in the region in april -- the strain , officials say , does not pose a threat to humans but could mutate and affect poultry			1
more from @entity43 : agriculture must play ' critical role ' in @entity43 's future since then , @entity5 authorities have imposed an exports suspension of ostrich products and banned restocking until the entire region is declared virus - free			1
in total , 41,000 ostriches have been culled			2
officials say farmers whose animals were culled have received compensation of 50 million rand ( $ 6.5 million ) but warn that the impact on the industry , which accounts for up to 80 % of the world 's ostrich products , is still severe			1
" the industry estimates that it is losing more than 100 million rand ( $ 13 million ) per month which is very serious , " says @entity63 , the spokesman for the @entity65 provincial @entity64			2
" the situation can not continue indefinitely and we very urgently need to try and get the industry back on its feet again , " adds @entity63			0

its industry exports 90 % of its output , generates about 1.2 billion rand ( $ 155 million ) a year and provides direct job opportunities for 20,000 people in @entity4			2

" they still have the ostriches in the farm , they keep on feeding them , they have to keep on paying their workers , " he says			0
that is one of the big issues with the other farmers			0
" late last month , authorities announced that the seventh round of surveillance for the @entity36 virus were negative			0
if the next round of tests also yields negative results , then the government can deem the outbreak to be over -- it is only then that @entity5 can apply to the @entity102 , their biggest importer of ostrich meat , to lift their ban and farmers can start restocking			1
but @entity94 says even if the ban is lifted " it will take at least three years for the industry to recover , " affecting the livelihood of the area 's farmers			2
" these are very rural areas with high unemployment figures so should the industry collapse in those areas it would have a very big , socio - economic impact , " he warns			2

" it is in our blood to do what we do and we will keep fighting for that , " he says			0
" i will not get out of this industry , i will keep fighting until we get birds back on this property and do what we have been doing for more than 100 years , " adds @entity3 .			0
