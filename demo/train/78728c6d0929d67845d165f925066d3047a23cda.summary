-- cycling at the @entity1 has taken a techie turn			2
@entity4 's web site shows messages written by a @entity6 on the @entity1 course			1
not only is @entity8 posting to @entity9 from the race , but a @entity6 -- a robot that writes in water - soluble paint -- is scribing messages onto the road , offering inspiration to the competitors and to cancer survivors			1
the @entity6 takes input from text messages and @entity9 posts sent by the public			1
the robot , a tractor - like device that 's pulled around by a truck , then paints those messages in large yellow letters along the @entity1 course			1
the letters face the riders so they can read them on their journey during the grueling annual race , which ends july 26 in @entity32			0
@entity33 , ceo of @entity34 , a mobile software company in @entity36 , @entity37 , helped design the robot as part of an ad campaign for @entity4			1
he said the @entity6 is part of a trend in art and marketing : digital creations are taking on real - world forms to get noticed and to have greater impact			1
" we have so much clutter and no editorship [ online ] , " he said			0
" you can launch new web sites all the time , but it 's really hard to stand out			0
i think the way to stand out is for people to think you have a real impact on your lives			0
" that sense of true impact is best achieved through real - world manifestations of online art , he said			2
the temporary paint messages are a high - tech take on old traditions at the @entity1 , said @entity66 , a spokesman for @entity4			1
" if you talk to any cyclist , they 'll tell you there 's a longstanding tradition to chalk messages of support , " he said			0
" and what we 've done is taken that insight and bought it to another level , so that someone in @entity79 can participate in the @entity1 and feel a part of something bigger			2
" the @entity6 ad campaign ties in with @entity83 , nickname of the @entity83 , which is devoted to cancer research and was founded by @entity86 cyclist @entity8 , a cancer survivor			1
@entity66 said many of the messages drawn by the @entity6 are from cancer survivors or their friends and family			2
a photo of one road message posted on @entity4 's web site says " my mom climbed over @entity96			2
" another says " if not us who / if not now when			0
" people who send text messages or @entity9 posts will be notified if their notes are chalked onto the road in @entity106 , @entity33 said			1
the robot takes a picture of the words on the road and sends that image , along with gps coordinates , to the person who submitted it , he said			0
@entity33 said the @entity6 was writing about 200 messages per day in the early days of the tour , which kicked off july 4			2
some towns along the route have banned the robot from writing on their streets , but most sections of the course have supported the ad campaign , he said			1
the robot writes its messages in paint that washes away quickly , he said			0
@entity33 declined to say how much the robot cost to build but said the effort is far less expensive than developing a television commercial			0
the @entity6 looks somewhat like a farm tractor and is fitted with 48 nozzles that spray out a mixture of air and temporary paint			0
a truck pulls the robot along the course at about 5 mph , and a person with a laptop sends commands to the device , telling it which messages to spray onto the road , according to @entity145			0
to send a message to the @entity6 , post a message to @ chalkbot on @entity9 , followed by the tag # @entity83 , or text @entity83 , followed by a message , to 36453			1
messages must be 40 characters or less			0
check out this video on @entity4 's site to see the @entity6 in action .			1
