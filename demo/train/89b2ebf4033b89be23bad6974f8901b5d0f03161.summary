" we still have prayers out there			0
we still believe in miracles			0
so do n't send me up the river yet , " @entity2 said in an interview on @entity1 's " @entity10 " tuesday night			1
the 48 - year - old actor will report to @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , thursday to begin serving a three - year sentence for failing to file tax returns			1

@entity2 was acquitted of felony charges			1
the actor conceded he was uneasy about losing his freedom if his appeal to the @entity26 @entity25 fails			0
" i think any man would be nervous if his liberty is at stake , " @entity2 said			2
" i 'm disappointed that the system seems not to be working for me in this situation			1
" prosecutors said @entity2 earned $ 40 million since 1999 but had filed no returns and had been involved in a tax resisters group			1
@entity2 disputed such involvement and said that the failure to file was his advisers ' fault			1
" this is another thing that has been misreported : it has been framed that i was a conspirator and that i was an architect in a scheme by an organization that has been characterized as tax protesters , " @entity2 said			1
" the press has n't reported that i was a client of people who i trusted [ who ] had knowledge and expertise in the areas of tax law that would protect my interests			0
" @entity2 is best known for his roles in the " @entity56 " action films , the comedy film " @entity53 " and the drama " @entity58			2
" last february , a jury convicted @entity2 on the misdemeanor charges , but he was acquitted of more serious felony charges of tax fraud and conspiracy			1
jurors accepted his argument that he was innocently duped by errant tax advisers			1
defense attorneys in court documents suggested that to sentence @entity2 harshly would be to disregard the jury 's verdict			1
but prosecutors , in their sentencing recommendation , said the jurors ' decision " has been portrayed in the mainstream media as a ' victory ' for @entity2			2
the troubling implication of such coverage for the millions of average citizens who are aware of this case is that the rich and famous @entity2 has ' gotten away with it			2
' in the end the criminal conduct of @entity2 must not be seen in such a light			2
" @entity2 suggested he was unfairly singled out by prosecutors			2

" one juror , @entity102 , gave @entity10 a written statement that three other jurors had made up their mind that @entity2 was guilty before the trial began			2
the jury 's verdict was a compromise between those jurors who thought @entity2 was guilty and those who did n't , @entity102 said in the statement			2
" that 's when a deal was made to find him guilty on the failure to file taxes and not guilty on the federal tax evasion charges , " @entity102 said in the statement			0
" we did not think he would go to jail			0
" @entity2 ' attorney , @entity121 , said neither he nor @entity122 had any involvement in preparing that juror 's statement to @entity10 , saying the show 's producers obtained it on their own			1
" we on the defense team never suggested that the media reach out to any of the jurors , " @entity121 said			0
@entity2 contended that some media accounts of his trial have distorted public perceptions			0

" i was never charged with tax evasion			0
i 've never been a tax protester			0
" @entity2 said he has paid his taxes			0
" they claimed that there was a certain number that was owed and that number has been all over that place			0
