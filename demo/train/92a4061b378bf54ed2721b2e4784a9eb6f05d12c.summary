the video clip lasts a mere 35 seconds			2
six men , illuminated by a flashlight , are sitting with their hands tied behind their backs and with various types of blindfolds			2
more men huddle behind them in the dark			2
in front of them is a pit , apparently freshly dug , and on the other side of the pit sits another man similarly bound and blindfolded			2
two seconds into the clip , someone says , " @entity18 ? " " ready ? " at three seconds a man extends his right arm into the light , holding a pistol			2
at six seconds the first shot is fired into the back of the first man 's head			2
the man with the pistol moves decisively , without hesitation , shooting one after the other in the back of the head			2
it would appear he has done this before many times			0
eleven seconds into the video clip , you can hear what sounds like open faucets			0
it 's the sound of blood gushing from the head wounds			0
and the gushing sound gets louder and louder			0
twenty - six seconds after the first shot is fired , a total of 14 men -- some of whom appear to be teenagers -- are dead or dying , some slumping into the pit			0
this video clip was one of a variety recently obtained by @entity54 from @entity56 activists			1
they document atrocities committed not by the regime of president @entity60 , but rather by members of the @entity62 in @entity63 and @entity56 , known as @entity64 , which emerged last year as a major power in opposition - controlled parts of northern @entity56			1
in the areas controlled by @entity64 , public floggings and executions have become commonplace			1
most recently @entity64 has battled other opposition groups in fighting that has left well over 2,000 people dead			1
even @entity75 's leader , @entity74 , has demanded isis leave @entity56			1
the material @entity54 obtained provides a snapshot of the inner workings of @entity64 , a group using methods and tactics not unlike those of the regime that @entity56 rose up against almost three years ago			1
the material provided by the activists was found in a house in @entity86 occupied by one " @entity87 , " or " the @entity63			1
" as is so often the case with members of these radical groups , this is not his real name			0
he abandoned the video clips , as well as the camera they were shot with , when @entity64 retreated from the area during fighting against other opposition groups			1
activists describe @entity87 as an " amir , " a commander , responsible for carrying out justice , @entity64 style			1
he is , in effect , judge , jury and executioner			0
he appears to be the man who carried out the executions described above			2
the other clips include eight interrogations of men , most of whom are members of opposition factions not affiliated with @entity64 , all operating in or around the town of @entity116 , northeast of @entity86			1
it 's not clear whether @entity87 is doing the interrogations , but the strong @entity63 accent of the interrogators leaves no doubt about where they come from			1
no torture occurs on camera , but it 's clear the subjects are under duress			0
they are all blindfolded , and several sweat profusely			0
the line of questioning is persistent , always focusing on the activities and opinions of opposition members			2
not once in the course of the lengthy interrogations is a single question posed about the @entity60 regime			1
in fact , it 's not even mentioned			0
there are veiled threats ; one of the men , who identifies himself as a doctor named @entity147 , is asked if he ever wants to see his two children again			0
another young man , @entity149 , is told to speak the truth to " save himself			0
" he responds by saying , " i will speak the truth , even if i lose my head			0
" @entity64 is clearly worried that many @entity56 view them as unwanted interlopers			1
thousands of young men have flocked from around the world , including @entity158 and @entity159 , to join the fight against the @entity60 regime , and many of the more radical among them have joined @entity64 and other jihadi groups			1
at one point the interrogator demands of the aforementioned @entity149 : " did n't people say @entity64 are strangers ? that they wear " chabounat ? " @entity168 is a derisive term referring to the short jalabiyas , or robes , worn by hard - line @entity172 to copy the attire of the @entity175			1
@entity168 in this case might be the equivalent of petticoats			0
@entity149 wisely claims complete ignorance			0
from the video clips , it appears that @entity87 has made a life for himself in @entity56			1
in a series of clips he is instructing a young woman in a black coat how to use an @entity188 assault rifle and a pistol			0
her face is exposed -- she is not wearing the " niqab , " which completely covers the face and has become de rigueur dress for women in areas controlled by @entity64			1
she speaks with a @entity56 accent			2
he 's also getting around in a late - model black @entity199 suv			0
and in another video clip , he is doing target practice in the garden of a high - walled villa			0
a fancy car , nice house , interrogations and mass executions : meet the new boss in this part of @entity56			1
same as the old boss .			0

videos obtained by @entity56 opposition activists show executions , interrogations
the *ringleader* , @entity218 , may be leader of @entity62 in @entity63 and @entity56
@entity64 is a jihadist group opposed to the regime of @entity56 president @entity60
