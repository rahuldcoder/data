@entity0 -- some terrorism suspects held in @entity5 , @entity6 , will be moved to an @entity8 prison that the federal government will buy to hold them , the @entity3 administration announced tuesday			1
fewer than 100 @entity5 detainees would come to the maximum - security @entity11 , 150 miles west of @entity13 , said @entity15 sen. @entity14 , @entity8			1
@entity16 rep. @entity16 of @entity8 put the figure at 70			2
an executive order issued by president @entity3 called for attorney general @entity19 to purchase the nearly vacant prison and for secretary of defense @entity29 to " prepare the [ prison ] for secure housing of detainees currently held at the @entity24 who have been or will be designated for relocation , and shall relocate such detainees to the [ prison ] , consistent with laws related to @entity5 detainees			2
" the federal government will enhance one section of the prison to make it exceed perimeter security standards at the nation 's only " supermax " prison in @entity38 , according to a letter to @entity8 gov. @entity41 signed by secretary of state @entity42 , @entity29 , @entity19 , homeland security secretary @entity43 and national intelligence director @entity44			1
about 215 detainees are held at the controversial @entity47 detention facility in @entity6 , and finding a place to move some of the detainees was crucial to government plans to close it			1
by closing @entity5 , " we are removing from terrorist organizations around the world the recruiting tool " the detention center symbolizes , said retired @entity57 gen. @entity56 , the national security adviser			2
at a @entity60 briefing , senior administration officials authorized to speak on background said the @entity63 prison would receive @entity5 detainees facing trial in @entity47 courts or by military commission			1
detainees being sent to other countries would travel directly from @entity5 without coming to the @entity47 , they said			0
@entity3 " has no intention of releasing any detainees in the @entity47 , " said the letter to @entity41			0
" current law effectively bars the release of the @entity5 detainees on @entity47 soil , and the federal government has broad authority under current law to detain individuals during removal proceedings and pending the execution of final removal orders			2
" read @entity60 letter to @entity41 ( @entity84 ) however , senior administration officials in said current law would have to change for any @entity5 suspects facing indefinite detention to be transferred to @entity47 soil			1
@entity41 welcomed the plan , saying it would bring badly needed jobs to the region and help serve the national security interest			2
he said @entity8 would charge a fair market price for the prison , which cost $ 145 million to build in 2001			1
" the local community is united in wanting to have this federal prison located in @entity63 , @entity8 , " @entity41 said			1
republicans criticized the plan for bringing terrorism suspects into the country despite questions over the legality of terms of their continued detention			0
" without a vote , a public hearing or a detailed plan , the governor and the administration are moving quickly to force the citizens of @entity8 to accept this risk , " @entity16 said			1
in a statement by @entity114 , the former commander of the @entity116 , which was attacked by @entity117 in @entity118 in 2000 , called closing @entity5 a mistake			0
" @entity121 and the @entity47 people must now stand up and prevent our communities , our justice system and our hard - earned money from being used by the @entity127 to prop up , perhaps , the most dangerous campaign promise ever uttered , " the statement quoted @entity120 as saying			0
an @entity130 group welcomed the development			0
" we applaud the @entity3 administration for taking an important step forward toward closing the debacle in @entity5 , " said former rep. @entity132 , director of the @entity133 to close @entity5			0
" president @entity3 is standing with gen. @entity138 , who has long called for the closure of @entity140 , and standing up to the politics of fear and manipulation , " he said in a statement			0
" it 's time for @entity121 to stop playing politics and join the president in removing this stain from @entity47 's standing in the world , save @entity47 taxpayers millions of dollars and deny @entity117 one of its most potent recruiting tools			0
" the @entity3 administration hoped to close the prison by january but has admitted that it will not meet that goal			2
@entity8 state officials have said the plan would call for housing federal prisoners , including some @entity5 detainees , in the largely vacant maximum - security facility in northern @entity8			1
the letter to @entity41 said federal prisoners from overcrowded facilities elsewhere would be transferred to the @entity63 prison , which also will house @entity5 detainees in the specially secured section			1
the governor and other officials have said that such a deal could provide 2,000 local jobs and up to $ 1 billion in federal money to the area			1
@entity14 , the @entity172 's second - ranking @entity171 , said in november that federal officials indicated that fewer than 100 detainees from @entity5 would be housed in the 1,600 - bed facility			1
they would be in a wing under the control of the @entity178 , while the @entity179 would assume responsibility for the rest of the facility			0
the @entity63 prison was built in 2001 and sat empty for five years because the state lacked the resources to open it			0
despite being built as a maximum - security facility , it houses 144 minimum - security male inmates , according to the @entity189 web site			0
among the @entity5 detainees are five with alleged ties to the september 11 conspiracy , including accused mastermind @entity192 , who will be transferred to @entity193 for trial in civilian court			0
