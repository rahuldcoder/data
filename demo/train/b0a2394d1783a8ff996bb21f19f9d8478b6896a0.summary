the steady drumbeat of preparations for some sort of a @entity4 strike in @entity5 is stirring up old anxieties			1
@entity4 have no appetite for another military campaign in a foreign land			2
@entity5 feels far away ; a tragedy , no doubt , but to many who strongly oppose any kind of intervention , it is simply too removed , too complicated , too foreign to view as an @entity4 problem			1
military action , the skeptics rightly say , has consequences , often unpredictable ones			0
inaction is more dangerous -- potentially riskier and costlier -- than smart , limited intervention			0
@entity5 may seem far away , but every passing day , every calamitous , explosive , hate - infused day , makes it more @entity24 's -- and the world 's -- problem			1
here are five reasons why : 1 ) other dictators are watching : when the president of the @entity4 says the use of chemical weapons is a " red line , " other dangerous regimes pay very close attention to see what he means			1
if that line is crossed -- as is gruesomely visible in @entity5 -- and nothing happens , it sends a clear signal to current and future powers that may threaten @entity4 interests and fundamental international norms			1
the message that @entity24 's warnings can be ignored , that the international community 's warnings can be disregarded , is most welcome in places like @entity48 and @entity49 , whose pursuits of weapons are a threat not just to the @entity4 but to the entire world			1
@entity5 : chemical weapons -- how did we get here ? 2 ) chemical weapons will be used in future battlegrounds : more than 100,000 people have been killed in @entity5			1
that alone should stir the conscience of humanity			0
but there is something uniquely dangerous about the introduction of chemical weapons			1
horrified by the effects of chemical weapons in the battlefield , nations have come together over the years to develop international bans on nerve gases , blister agents , blood agents and choking agents			1
the @entity5 government , by all appearances , used nerve gas to kill hundreds of its own citizens			1
if it passes without a response , this will not be the last time we see these weapons in use -- and not just in a distant battlefield			0
chemical weapons are not only appealing to dictators refusing to relinquish power , but they also could make an appearance in other wars , and they are ideal for terrorist groups seeking to inflict maximum fear			1
@entity92 : stay out of @entity5 's civil war 3 ) the war is spreading , the choices are worsening : the @entity4 has largely kept its distance in the @entity5 civil war			1
two years ago , president @entity98 declared that president @entity99 must go			2
a year ago , he drew his famous red line			2
but any hope that the situation would somehow resolve itself has only produced the worst possible outcome			0
the @entity4 should have provided material and logistical help to the more moderate among the rebels early on			2
failure to do so resulted in today 's terrible dearth of good choices , in which @entity24 wants @entity99 to fall , but the opposition is dominated by extremist jihadists , some of them affiliated with @entity113			2
in the meantime , the war is bursting beyond @entity5 borders			2
millions of @entity5 have fled their homes , straining resources and occasionally raining fire into @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and even @entity124			2
the war threatens to engulf the region			0
the @entity127 remains the most explosive region of the world			0
it produces a big portion of oil supplies and it lies at the crossroads of global commerce			0
this is the last place to allow a wildfire to spread before trying to affect its direction and ultimately extinguish it			0
opinion : why @entity141 intervention in @entity5 will leave chaos 4 ) inaction will hand a victory to @entity99 , @entity48 and @entity145 : the @entity98 administration is telegraphing an attack against @entity5 aimed at punishing @entity99 and sending a message to the world , rather than seeking to change the course of this civil war			1
but the course of the war matters			0
without forceful @entity4 action , @entity99 's latest maneuvers constitute a victory for his regime and its top allies , @entity48 and @entity145			1
giving a boost to this alliance runs counter to regional and global peace and stability			0
@entity48 and @entity145 have a nefarious track record			1
they have carried out a wave of terrorist attacks in @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity24			0
just last week a judge in @entity170 sentenced an @entity48 man to life in prison for his role in a terrorist plot against @entity124 diplomats in @entity177			2
@entity48 and @entity145 agents have been implicated in terrorist plots in @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 and elsewhere			1
even if you do n't care about @entity5 or the @entity127 , handing a victory to this dangerous threesome should worry everyone			2
' red line ' debate : chemical weapons worse than attacks ? 5 ) a new generation of hatred will perpetuate this tragedy : the war in @entity5 has raged for 2Â½ years			1
during that time , it has descended into ever greater levels of brutality and carnage			0
it has also become increasingly sectarian			0
it all started as a peaceful uprising demanding a dictator step down and allow a democratic government representing the different religions and ethnicities in @entity5			0
it is now a hate - filled maelstrom of @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 and others			0
people are being killed based on their community of origin			0
this is how you create hatreds that burn through the ages , enduring for generations of revenge - seeking , and triggering new wars			0
the longer this fire rages , the more likely its sparks will start new fires , far into the future			0
the @entity4 and its friends should strike @entity99 in a way that shows the world will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons , and prove that @entity24 's threats and international commitments have meaning and muscle			1
beyond that , @entity239 should do what it should have done long ago			0
without sending any @entity4 troops into @entity5 , the @entity4 and its allies should find and strengthen the more moderate members of the opposition so they will gain the upper hand against extremists within opposition ranks			2
then they can remove @entity99 from power by wining what is , most assuredly , their war , the @entity5 ' war , but one that is of great consequence to @entity24 and to the rest of the world .			1

@entity259 : @entity4 inaction in @entity5 is risky ; the situation endangers the world
she says *tyrants* are watching after president drew line on chemical weapons
@entity270 : if @entity5 's use of nerve gas is ignored , it will open doors for its use in future
@entity270 : war is spreading , and @entity4 must not let @entity99 , @entity48 and @entity145 win
