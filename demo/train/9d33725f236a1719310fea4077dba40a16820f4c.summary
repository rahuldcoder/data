@entity0 -- with her lashings of butter and flirtations with the camera , celebrity chef @entity2 has charmed her many fans by turning everyday cooking into a more sensual experience			1
as she 's licked her fingers while talking viewers through her recipes , she has earned nicknames such as " domestic goddess " and the " queen of food porn " in the @entity18 media			1
but her successful cooking career has not been mirrored in her recent personal life			2
her 10 - year marriage to millionaire art collector @entity22 collapsed after photos of the couple having an argument at a restaurant emerged in june			1

@entity31 accepted a police caution for assault , and the couple announced they would divorce soon after			0
since then , the trial of the couple 's two former personal assistants -- who were cleared friday of defrauding @entity35 and @entity31 of hundreds of thousands of pounds -- has gripped the media			1

in her own testimony , @entity35 , 53 , confirmed she had taken cocaine half a dozen times , during two periods of her life , and used cannabis in the past			1
but she denied being a habitual user , saying , " i did not have a drug problem , i had a life problem			1
" ' i am not a chef ' her admission of limited drug use may cause some surprise because of @entity35 's connections with the @entity18 political establishment			1
born in @entity0 , she is the daughter of @entity35 , a former @entity88 @entity18 chancellor of the exchequer , or finance minister			1
her brother @entity91 was formerly editor of @entity92 , a @entity18 conservative political magazine			0

the couple had two children			0
in 2001 , @entity105 died after a battle with throat cancer			0
@entity35 went on to contribute to various @entity18 newspapers before writing books			2
in 1998 , she brought out " how to eat , " in which she stated how food was an early love			0
" i am not a chef			0
i am not even a trained or professional cook			0
my qualification is as an eater , " she wrote			0
