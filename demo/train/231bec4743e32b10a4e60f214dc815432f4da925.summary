it 's a question many people inside @entity2 -- and those who watch the country closely around the world -- were asking wednesday : who is killing nuclear scientists in @entity2 ? an explosion on wednesday killed @entity10 , a top official at the @entity12 uranium enrichment plant , @entity2 officials said			1
he is the third man identified as a nuclear scientist to be killed in @entity2 in a mysterious explosion in the past two years			2
a fourth survived an assassination attempt			0
in each case , someone placed a bomb under the scientist 's car			0
@entity2 officials , on state - run media , blame @entity23 and the @entity24			1
" i want to categorically deny any @entity24 involvement in any kind of act of violence inside @entity2 , " @entity24 secretary of state @entity25 said wednesday			1
" we believe there has to be an understanding between @entity2 , its neighbors and the international community that finds a way forward for it to end its provocative behavior , end its search for nuclear weapons and rejoin the international community and be a productive member of it , " she said			2
while @entity23 generally refuses to comment on accusations and speculation , @entity45			2
gen. @entity46 , a spokesman for the @entity47 , said on his @entity49 page wednesday , " i have no idea who targeted the @entity2 scientist but i certainly do n't shed a tear			1
" @entity54 , a former director of the @entity2 department in the @entity47 ' @entity56 , told @entity57 that wednesday 's attack was part of broader pressure being brought to bear on president @entity62 's regime			2
" many bad things have been happening to @entity2 in the recent period			2
@entity2 is in a situation where pressure on it is mounting , and the latest assassination joins the pressure that the @entity2 regime is facing , " @entity54 said			2
with no one claiming responsibility , the killings remain shrouded in mystery			0
@entity2 experts contacted by @entity76 could only speculate			2
" the most likely contender among people who are following this is that the @entity23 are doing it , possibly in cooperation with the @entity2 mujahedin , " said @entity77 , president of the @entity78 and author of the book " a @entity81 : @entity89 's diplomacy with @entity2			1
" " there 's almost no downside for @entity23 , " he said			2
the killings " take out nuclear assets and embarrass @entity2 " by showing that the regime ca n't prevent such attacks , @entity77 said			1
and " if @entity2 retaliates with a violent act , then @entity23 can point to it as a reason to take military action against the regime			1
" @entity100 , resident scholar with the @entity101 , agrees that @entity23 involvement is the most " plausible " scenario			1
and @entity104 , senior associate with the @entity105 , also said the way the attacks took place " would be consistent " with the possibility of @entity23 acting with cooperation inside @entity2			1
@entity77 told @entity76 he does not believe the killings are the work of the @entity24 , and said they do not match the kind of activity @entity24 intelligence would carry out in a country with which there is no declared state of war			1
@entity100 agreed , and gave a different reason			0
" frankly , i do n't think the @entity24 has the human intelligence knowledge , " he said			1
the @entity24 and @entity23 have been the most vocal opponents of @entity2 's nuclear program , although numerous countries have expressed serious concern as well			1
@entity2 insists its nuclear program is for peaceful , civilian energy purposes			2
if @entity23 is cooperating with the @entity127 ( @entity127 ) to carry out attacks on @entity2 nuclear officials , it faces a significant risk , @entity77 argues			1
the @entity24 lists the @entity127 as a terrorist group			2
" @entity23 is a victim of terrorism and pressing other states to take measures against terrorism , " @entity77 noted			2
if it turns out to be collaborating with a group on the @entity24 list of @entity142 , @entity23 's efforts to get other countries to crack down on terrorist groups could be damaged			1
@entity127 , an @entity2 opposition group , has support from some members of @entity145 who say it should be removed from the terrorist list			1
several analysts said they are certain that , whoever is organizing the killings , @entity2 are involved			1
if @entity2 leaders had a " clue " who is behind the killings , " they 'd have stopped this by now , " said @entity151 , @entity152 with @entity153			2
" the incredible thing is that it continues			0
that suggests it is @entity2 doing the deeds , no matter who is the sponsor			0
foreigners are under pretty tight scrutiny in @entity2 these days			0
" but @entity104 , of the @entity105 , said he believes @entity23 agents could be inside @entity2			1
whoever 's behind the attacks knows who the nuclear officials are , and the specifics of their travel plans			0
that could be foreign governments with intelligence assets in @entity2 , @entity104 said			1
but it 's also " conceivable this could be carried out by @entity2 who oppose the government even without the support of outside governments , " @entity104 said			1
the nuclear program " is a centerpiece for @entity2 , a very , very important aspect for this regime , " he said			0
groups inside @entity2 dedicated to overthrowing the regime would have reason to target the program , he said			0
" this is a program which is right at the heart of the legitimacy of this government			0
" @entity100 , of the @entity101 , said there is another " plausible " explanation : that " @entity195 intelligence services " are involved			1
" the assumption that many @entity24 have that the @entity198 , " @entity23 's foreign intelligence unit , " is the most skilled intelligence service " in the @entity152 is " a couple of decades out of date , " he said			1
some intelligence services in the @entity195 world " could have recruited @entity202 " in the region , potentially in @entity206 , to take action against the nuclear program , he said			1
there is also some speculation that the @entity2 regime itself could have been involved in at least one of the killings			0
the first , in january 2010 , left university professor and nuclear scientist @entity214 dead in a car bomb			0
that attack came shortly after major riots against the regime , and many people thought the regime was behind that killing , @entity77 said			0
@entity222 " did not seem to be a particularly valuable nuclear target , " he said			0
some reports suggested @entity222 was an outspoken supporter of the " green movement , " and had helped organize protests , @entity77 said			0
but the man killed in november 2010 , @entity228 , and the one who survived an assassination attempt at the time , @entity231 , were a different story			0
it " would make no sense for the @entity2 to assassinate them , " @entity77 said			0
" they were critical nuclear assets			0
" no matter who is behind them , the attacks do not seem to be reversing @entity2 's efforts , said @entity77			0
" arguably , the incentive for the @entity2 to go forward with what they have has grown , because now they 're under such critical threat , " he said			0
but there are suggestions that the overall pressure being applied against @entity2 , including international sanctions , for its failure to cooperate on nuclear issues is making some scientists wary of adding their efforts			0
@entity2 's semi-official @entity253 news agency earlier this week quoted @entity231 , now the head of @entity2 's nuclear program , describing as " deserters " in a " scientific war " the " scientists who , for the sake of preserving their international connections , refuse to cooperate in ( our ) nuclear projects			0
" the killings of @entity2 scientists have come up on the campaign trail in the @entity24 among contenders for the @entity266 presidential nomination			1
@entity268 , at a debate in november , expressed support for the idea of " taking out their scientists			0
" @entity274 , at an event in october , referred to the scientists turning up dead as " a wonderful thing			0
" @entity10 's killing comes amid growing tensions between @entity2 and the @entity279			0
@entity24 officials say the international sanctions on @entity2 have taken a toll			1
@entity2 earlier this week sentenced a @entity24 ex-marine to death on charges of espionage , despite statements by him , his family , and the @entity24 government that he is not a spy .			1

@entity24 secretary of state @entity292 categorically denies any involvement in @entity2
an @entity23 military spokesman says he does n't " shed a tear " over the reported death
analyst : @entity23 involvement with support from some in @entity2 is the most likely scenario
