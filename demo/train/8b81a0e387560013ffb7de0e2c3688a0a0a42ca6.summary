-- the eastern @entity2 city of @entity3 produces more cigarette lighters and spectacles than anywhere on earth , and has long been seen as an economic trend - setter for the entire country			1
so reports that dozens of factory owners in the city have absconded in recent weeks , leaving workers unpaid and mountains of debt , are seen by some as an ominous sign for the national economy			2
slowing global demand for cheap @entity2 exports , rising production costs and unsustainable levels of debt have combined to crush some of the country 's most savvy entrepreneurs			1
in one tragic case , the owner of a @entity3 shoe factory who owed more than @entity27 ( $ 63m ) committed suicide three weeks ago			0
more than 90 other bosses have run away , according to state media			0
trade fluctuations in @entity2 , the world 's leading exporter , are often seen as indicators of the health of the global economy -- and for some bearish investors , @entity3 's problems are a sign that a hard landing is imminent for the nation			1
this is a dire prospect for the global economy at a time when most of the developed world is facing the likelihood of renewed recession			0
in fact , the city 's troubles are un-likely to trigger a drastic nationwide crash any time soon ; most analysts believe @entity2 is on track for just a gradual slowdown in coming months			1
but events in that city do represent a crucial turning point for the nation			0
" what 's happening in @entity3 is a reflection of the current @entity2 model coming to an end , " says @entity60 of @entity61 about the country 's export - led , investment - driven growth paradigm			1
" @entity2 's economic success over the last 30 years has been built on cheap capital , cheap labour , cheap energy and cheap land but this has now produced huge imbalances and inefficiencies that are causing more and more problems			1
" the change will affect not just inhabitants of the world 's most populous nation , where growth averaging 10 per cent a year for the past three decades has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty			2
it also heralds a structural change that will affect western businesses and consumers long used to ever cheaper @entity2 goods			1
in addition , the shift will hit exporters in both developed and emerging economies that are increasingly reliant on @entity2 's appetite for raw materials to feed its investment and construction boom , which shows signs of running out of steam			1
@entity2 's economic miracle began in 1978 , when the @entity99 launched market - oriented reforms granting farmers limited property rights and permission to sell anything they produced in excess of state quotas			1
this led to soaring agricultural productivity and rural incomes			0
it was followed by reforms encouraging mass migration , industrialisation and investment in a manufacturing sector that became known as the workshop for the world			0
in 1990 , income per capita was 30 per cent lower than the average for @entity120			0
today , at more than $ 4,000 , it is three times greater , according to @entity124 data			0
the unbeatable " @entity2 price " that attracted investors and buyers from all over the world was predicated on an endless supply of cheap , pliant labour ; virtually free land ; cheap and easy credit from state - owned banks ; and heavily suppressed costs for inputs such as power and water			1
but having drastically raised the living standards of almost a fifth of humanity , the formula is increasingly seen as defunct , and a contributor to serious problems including environmental degradation and rapidly rising social inequality			2
" the drivers of @entity2 's meteoric rise are on the wane , " says @entity146 , @entity124 president			1
" resources have largely shifted from agriculture to industry ; as the labour force shrinks and the population ages , there are fewer workers to support retirees ; and productivity increases are on the decline			0
" with its world - class infrastructure and existing domestic and international supply chains , @entity2 will remain a global manufacturing base for some time to come			1
but minimum wages are rising more than 20 per cent a year in many areas , and land is increasingly scarce and expensive			2
in addition , the government is reducing the supply of cheap credit and has moved to liberalise prices for energy and other utilities			2
meanwhile , the flood of investment in new factories , roads , airports and housing estates that has been the main driver of growth looks increasingly unsustainable			2
back in @entity3 , @entity181 , general manager of @entity183 , says times are tough			0
the business , which makes products from plastic bottles to zips , has been squeezed by rising costs and a lack of workers willing to take wages considered generous just a couple of years ago			1
" we are making much less money than before and in - put price rises are so serious it is hard to find many companies that are making money these days , " mr @entity181 says			0
his predicament is partly a result of demographics			0
many experts believe @entity2 's working - age population has already peaked and will decline in coming years , a trend exacerbated by the three - decade - old one - child policy			1
it is also partly the price of success for the country 's meteoric economic rise , which is lifting the prices of almost everything and shrinking the pool of impoverished workers willing to toil in factories or on construction sites for a pittance			0
the country 's leadership is well aware of the distortions that have built up in the economy ; and freely acknowledges time is running out for a model that has served it so well			0
" @entity2 suffers a serious lack of balance , co-ordination and sustainability in its development , " president @entity226 said in a recent speech			1
" we must accelerate strategic adjustment of the economic structure , scientific and technological progress and innovation , and the building of a resource - conserving and environmentally friendly society			0
" @entity242 's latest five - year plan , which runs from 2011 until 2015 , is packed full of vows to increase domestic consumption and wean the economy off its reliance on exports and particularly investment			0
but leaders have been talking for more than a decade about achieving these goals , and in fact the reverse has occurred			2
consumption fell from about 45 per cent of gross domestic product in the late 1990s to an unusually low 33 per cent last year			0
investment has hit a global high of 50 per cent of gdp			0
" when reforms began 30 years ago , the investment rate was around 25 per cent of gdp and the economy grew at around 10 per cent a year , but now we are investing half of gdp for the same rate of growth ; that tells you something about capital efficiency , " says mr @entity60 of @entity61			1
an involuntary shift from the old model appeared possible when the global financial crisis erupted in the west in 2008 , triggering a collapse in global demand for @entity2 exports , which fell by more than a third in the year to march 2009			1
thousands of factories closed and more than 23m migrant workers poured out of cities such as @entity3			0
in response , @entity242 launched an economic stimulus package described by some economists as the biggest monetary and fiscal easing in history as it sought to cushion the blow to exporters			2
state - controlled banks were ordered to flood the economy with cash and local officials told to ramp up investment to jump - start growth			2
the result was a surge in credit - fuelled investment , particularly in residential property			0
in cities across the country , the results can be seen in forests of half - built apartment blocks , stadiums and convention centres			0
to the rest of the world , the stimulus appeared an unqualified success , pushing headline gdp growth rates back up into double digits and stoking @entity2 demand for imports , especially of natural resources			1
but the reliance on debt and investment accentuated all the distortions @entity242 had already identified in its growth model -- and added the prospect of a serious property bubble			1
most analysts agree @entity2 's economy , now the second largest , is today less healthy and more imbalanced than before the crisis , and even more reliant on investment , particularly in property and infrastructure			1
" it 's as if the economy ballooned in weight by eating too much in the way of resources and becoming obese , " says @entity326 of the @entity327 , a @entity328 - based think - tank			0
while the model may be coming to an end , most economists believe @entity2 remains on track for a soft landing in coming months as growth moderates			1
gdp figures for the third quarter , due out on tuesday , are likely to show annual growth that remains above 9 per cent			2
even if a severe slump were to hit , @entity242 would still have the option of loosening monetary policy to revive the economy in the short term , and re-versing steps to cool the red - hot property market and rein in credit made available by the stimulus package			0
but there is unlikely to be a return to the boom years of the previous decade , when inflation remained dormant as @entity257 rose			1
instead , growth will probably be 8 per cent or less , accompanied by persistent price rises -- @entity358 predicts average consumer inflation of 5 per cent from 2011 to 2015 , compared with 2 per cent from 2001 to 2010			2
and now that @entity2 is the global production capital for so many of the world 's manufactured goods , enduring @entity2 inflation will mean higher prices for consumers the world over			1
@entity242 has identified the action it needs to take -- but many analysts believe it must do far more to hasten economic rebalancing towards consumption than its current efforts to provide better social services , build subsidised apartment blocks and encourage minimum wage increases			0
" @entity2 has limited time to effect a radical political and economic shift , " according to @entity377 of @entity378			2
" if this shift does n't start in earnest soon , the @entity2 economy will succumb to a credit and investment bust from which significantly slower growth would follow , and this will be especially sensitive in a @entity2 where incidents of social unrest are increasing significantly in number , intensity and breadth			1

@entity393 hurt by slowing demand for cheap @entity2 goods , rising costs and debt
" @entity2 suffers a serious lack of balance , co-ordination and sustainability in its development , " said @entity226
economists believe @entity2 remains on track for a soft landing as growth moderates
there is unlikely to be a return to the boom years of the previous decade
