-- dear @entity1 , we are under attack			2
we are bought and sold like cattle			0
we are threatened and killed for voicing our dreams			0
when one girl in the world suffers for being born female , every girl in the world is made vulnerable			1
gender - based hate in the most remote corner of the @entity13 threatens the very core of our dignity			0
how can any of us be free while our sisters are slaves in this very instant ? to turn a blind eye to a single girl living in sub-human status is to accept that status for each and every one of us			0
if the girls of the world stay silent , we will protect hate			1
only our collective voice can carry our stories far and wide enough to drive out the oppression of girls everywhere			2
until the day we all have the opportunity to speak up for ourselves , we have to bear witness for one another			0
lift your voice for those who ca n't ! write an open letter about what girls ' education means to you			1
