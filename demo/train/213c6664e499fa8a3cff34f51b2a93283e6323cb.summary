-- it has been 20 years since best - selling crime writer @entity2 began work on her first novel in the series chronicling the cases of forensic analyst dr. @entity7			1
now , both have found celebrity			0
@entity2 's latest novel , " the @entity11 , " places her enduring heroine in a role the author knows all too well , a pop culture celebrity sought - after for her expertise			1
in an interview with @entity0 , @entity2 discussed the challenges of staying fresh , the need for happy endings and the merits of the @entity22 and the movie " @entity24			1
" @entity0 : the title of your new book , " the @entity11 , " has many meanings			1
can you tell me about some of them ? @entity2 : on the one hand , it 's a very direct reference to the fact she 's the chief forensic analyst for @entity0 in this book			1
but while she 's doing the on - air spots , they decide they want her to have her own show and that 's what they call it , " the @entity11 , " which is a reference to a cliché that 's beginning to float around , that there 's one element that she can add that will solve the case like she 's @entity50			2
this becomes very upsetting to her , first of all , because it 's a cliché and the scientist in her does n't think she has a special factor , she 's a scientist			1
it begins to pose problems for her because even some colleagues and friends start to wonder if she 's begun to believe her own legend and make mistakes			2
with her years of experience and high level of visibility and exceptional grasp of the criminal world , she would be asked to be on major shows			2
when someone like @entity75 dies or @entity76 disappears , that 's the obvious thing that would happen			2
people would say , i wonder what @entity7 has to say			1
i 'm trying to put her in the world we live in			0
@entity0 : why did you choose @entity0 ? @entity2 : it would make perfect sense that she would sit on the set with @entity87 or @entity88 and be asked relevant questions from a hard news angle			1
it 's one [ network ] she would go on and there 's lots she would n't go on			1
@entity0 : how have things changed since you published your first novel ? @entity2 : when i was shopping my first book around , it was rejected by the major publishing houses and that was because a lot of people did n't think morgues and labs were interesting , and that 's a huge statement about how things have changed			1
i remember one time , i called my literary agent at that time , and i said i was in a toxicology lab , and she said , i hate talking to you because you 're always in these awful places			0
forensic science was not viewed as cool , as it is today			2
@entity0 : are there any on - air personalities we might recognize in " the @entity11 ? " @entity2 : when she is up at @entity0 for a scene when she 's on a fictitious show , she walks past posters of @entity121 and @entity122 and @entity123 because she 's up on that floor , so i do make real references to people , but the characters , the producers , none are real and they 're not based on anybody i met or know			1
@entity0 : how much of yourself do you see in @entity7 ? over the years , have you grown into her or has she grown into you ? @entity2 : only insofar as we have the same values and sensibilities and perhaps the same approach to solving cases			1
i 'm imposing the way my mind works in terms of connecting the dots , but beyond that , there are huge differences between us			2
she 's a standalone character			2
i would feel very self - conscious and bored if she was a projection of me			0
i have certain things in common with all my characters			0
like @entity149 , i can be a slob and sometimes say stupid things and rush to judgment			0
@entity0 : you 're known for doing a lot of research on the ground to give your stories depth and realism			1
where did your research for " the @entity11 " take you ? @entity2 : i 've certainly been in the @entity0 studios so that 's helpful			1
when i was there over in the last year , i made a mental note of everything i saw while walking around so i could create the studio in the novel			0
i also spent lot of time with the @entity170 , their bomb squad , their emergency unit , the @entity173 , so i could describe the amazing way computers are used to transmit data to police responding to a call			0
i spent time at the @entity170 crime lab , the @entity182 medical examiner 's office , so i can show @entity7 actually working there			1
the scene in the elevator in the beginning and the way people @entity189 loved ones is based on what happens			0
even the technology of the electronic nose , the mechanical sniffer that takes the place of cadaver dogs , is based on things i 've seen			0
my research also included looking into the methods and means criminals are using , like @entity201 , spoofcards and the different ways to disguise ip addresses			0
@entity0 : how has the @entity206 factor affected your research for your books ? @entity2 : i think people are so inundated with this sort of detail that i do n't want to make the story just about forensics			1
the people and their relationships are the heart of my books , the forensics are something they wear like an old pair of shoes			2
i 'll always show you the latest and greatest forensic science and technology , but i ca n't show it all , so it 's very important that i make things interesting in different ways			1
in the early to mid- ' 90s , up to the late ' 90s when i was coming out with new books , i was the only show in town and all of the sudden now they 're everywhere , and i do n't have any problem with that because i do n't own forensics or forensic pathology			1
@entity0 : in your opinion , what has been the greatest change in forensic science since @entity7 started out ? @entity2 : @entity241 has changed our lives forever , just like the @entity244 has changed our lives , there 's no going back to @entity246 or pre-internet			1
i would say both of those			0
the @entity244 has dramatically changed everything because it 's creating a whole new wave of crimes that our laws and the courts do n't know how to deal with			2
dna analysis and the ultra-sensitivity of it : when you 're dealing with some types of dna , you only need three or four human cells to get a dna profile , which is something that ca n't even see with the naked eye , so that helps investigators but it also creates a whole other set of problems			2
they 're saying there will be a point when you can get dna just from someone walking in the room , and you can see the problems if you have 20 people walk into a room and only one did something bad			0
defense lawyers are going to have a field day with that			0
@entity0 : what do you want people to take away from this novel ? i 'd like them to take away an idea of how someone like @entity7 deals with being in the same world you and i wake up to			1
now she has a @entity291 and she has to deal with it , which poses as many problems as it offers benefits			0
i want people to feel happy ending the book			2
we need to feel good right now , there 's a lot to feel bad about and that 's something i decided with the last book , i did n't want people to be depressed when they finished it			1
i used to write very dark books but we lived in happier times			0
now , the goal is to scare you , lead you into suspense but when you finish , i want you to feel happy			0
@entity0 : what current cases in the news fascinate you ? how much attention do you pay to crime and justice news ? @entity2 : i 'm fascinated by the @entity75 situation and the people who disappear and get abducted , all of it fascinates me in terms of the psychology involved and what science might tell us			1
i 'm always frustrated because i love to know what 's behind the scenes			0
i 've been following @entity75 because it seems so unnecessary , an example of people who should 've said no and not taken it upon themselves to solve a problem			0
i 've also been interested in the case in @entity330 with the @entity331 on trial for murder			0
that is intriguing from a forensic standpoint because i think all of us would like to know more about the evidence and what 's there to piece together that could tell us what happened			2
i 'm afraid that because of how much time has passed and how the case was handled that a lot of the answers are gone and the kind of evidence that was collected could have been handled differently , @entity0 : what do you like to watch ? @entity2 : i do n't watch crime dramas			1
i do n't want to subconsciously get ideas from their shows			2
i try to keep my mind blank , and keep the influence of my own research , so i do n't tend to watch crime dramas or crime movies			1
i rarely read crime novels because my work is so steeped in nonfiction , so i try to keep my mind free of those ideas			0
what i watch is the nonfiction , documentary type things , shows that depict real crimes that happened			2
i like the @entity22 and i will watch reruns of " @entity368 " until i 'm 90 years old			0
i like comedy , stuff that 's mindless			0
i do n't watch stuff that scares me or makes me sad			1
there 's enough of that in real life			0
@entity0 : what 's the last movie you saw ? @entity2 : the last movie i saw was a rerun of " @entity24			1
" how 's that to people who think i have this very esoteric repertoire ? i think it 's a hilarious movie			0
... @entity384 , i love his stuff , @entity386 , i really enjoy comedy , especially stuff that 's kind of warmhearted in its own way			0
i do n't like stuff that 's really scary			1
i 've seen so much stuff that 's real			0
blood is always real to me			0
if they ever make a real movie of @entity7 , i may not be able to watch it .			1
