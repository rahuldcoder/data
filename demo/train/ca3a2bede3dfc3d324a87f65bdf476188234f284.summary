@entity0 , @entity1 -- by daybreak , much of this town has already been at work for hours			0
fishermen have long since cast off aboard boats named for their sweethearts and chugged out to sea before sunrise			2
clad in yellow and orange rubber suits , these seafarers drag giant nets across the ocean floor during 12 - hour work days , hauling back the fish they will later bring to market			2
for some 400 years , fishing has sustained communities such as @entity0 along @entity20 's northeastern shores , where thousands of seafood processors , wholesalers , distributors and retailers make a living off the waterfront			1
" it 's kind of the bread - and - butter and the backbone of the community , " said @entity27 , who has scooped up fish off the coast of @entity1 for more than two decades			2
now the federal government is contemplating what for generations seemed inconceivable -- restricting or shutting down most of the cod fishing in the @entity38 , a region that extends from @entity39 up through @entity40			1
a recent government survey found that @entity38 cod , considered a top earner for fishermen in the region , are in far lower numbers than what experts had thought			1
just three years earlier , the government had projected the area was well on its way to recovery after decades of overfishing			2
since then , federal regulators have raised cod catch rates to nearly five times the sustainable level based on what are now reported as overly optimistic and incomplete estimates			1
the new data now suggests the stocks are so depleted that even if the fishing industry were to shut down , codfish would still not recover by 2014 to the levels mandated by federal law			1
beginning in may , that will trigger a legal requirement that fishermen bring in around 22 % less cod than they caught last year			1
but next year is the big one -- gulf of @entity38 cod fishing could face more than an 80 % reduction from prior years ' catches			1
" this is total @entity78 now for the fishery , " said @entity73 , a third - generation @entity0 fisherman and policy director for the @entity75 , an advocacy group for the fishing industry			1
the coming restrictions , he and others say , are based on assumptions that come from data that 's " inherently volatile			0
" " what happens when you do everything right and they still shut you down ? " @entity88 also swim alongside other fish , which means the proposed reductions would impact other industry staples such as flounder and haddock , even though those populations are considered to be far healthier			2
while larger trawlers capable of traveling to more distant fishing grounds are expected to survive , the reductions could cost most of the region 's smaller crews their jobs			2
" we basically have a balloon payment now to make up for those years ( of overfishing ) , " said @entity100 , a scientist at the @entity101 , who worked on the assessment			2
@entity100 and others say a year is n't enough time to make up the difference and meet federal mandates , which he says could signal an end to much of the region 's small - boat fleet			1
environmentalists say depleted stocks show the region needs time to recover			1
" the coastal fishermen are facing an impossible situation through no fault of their own , " said @entity117 , a lawyer with the @entity119 - based @entity118 , an environmental advocacy group			1
" but once those fisheries are gone , that 's it			0
" still , codfish are n't about to become an endangered species , according to @entity128 , head of the @entity130 's fisheries service			0
the coming restrictions are about protecting the overall size of the cod population , which has been at steady but low levels for decades , and complying with federal law			2
confronted with possible drops in domestic supply , industry analysts say @entity20 cod consumers will likely look elsewhere , importing more from countries such as @entity141 and @entity142			1
" it will affect the local fresh market , " said @entity100			2
" but there 's a lot of frozen cod on the market from elsewhere			2
" aboard the @entity148 , a not - quite - paid - off fishing trawler named for @entity27 's wife , talk of cutbacks is a source of anxiety			1
" if they cut half the quota , that 's my last day here , " said crew member @entity155 , hauling back nets from the day 's catch -- a mixture of cod , lobsters and flounder			1
" i 'd have to leave			0
" @entity155 , his face pink from the biting cold of a winter wind at sea , says he 's tired of the uncertainty			2
" i 'm sick of everybody else running my life , my income , " he said			0
" it 's up to them			0
it has nothing to do with me			0
" fishermen say the cod report does n't actually reflect what they 've seen out on the water			1
surveys come from a murky science , they say , that rely on catch records , government observers and random samplings at sea			2
they move , " said @entity73 , emphasizing the difficulty of counting unseen fish in a region the size of @entity195 that nearly spans the length of @entity197			0
" the data they have is ' best available , ' " he said			0
" we 're going to destroy 400 years of fishing based on what 's ' best available ' ? " @entity100 , a former @entity130 scientist , said the survey is " not much different than a weather report " and considers the issue more of an " administrative crisis than an environmental one			1
" but the @entity130 says the work is based on three years of additional data , and includes better technologies as well as records of fish discarded by recreational agencies -- something that was n't tallied in 2008			0
" we just have a much more realistic picture of the stock , " said @entity130 spokeswoman @entity216			0
" the really troubling thing here is the low number of young fish coming in			0
" other factors , she noted , like shifts in water temperature and natural predators , also likely contributed to the depletion of a once cod - heavy region			1
" @entity39 fishing in @entity197 is like cowboys out @entity235 , " said @entity216 , stressing @entity197 's historical ties to the bottom - dwelling ground fish			1
" they do n't call it @entity39 for nothing			0
" her agency 's report has become a hot topic among interests groups and legislators in @entity245 and @entity38 , though especially in @entity119 , where a wooden carving of a codfish still hangs from the @entity248			1
@entity1 ranks second , behind @entity249 , in the number of jobs supported by the fishing industry			1
and @entity38 cod brought in nearly $ 16 million to the regional economy in 2010 , before distribution sales were tallied			1
" when i was a kid growing up , people would ask who your father went fishing with as a way of identifying who you are , " said @entity256 , 62 , owner of @entity257 in @entity0			0
" it 's been a way of life here			0
" recreational fishing on charter boats , like the one @entity256 owns , now account for more than 30 % of the region 's total catch			1
the danger , industry advocates say , is a loss of market share			0
" you ca n't expect the fishery to come back in the same way after taking years off , " said @entity275 , executive director of the @entity75			0
" your suppliers and consumers just go elsewhere			0
it takes years to develop those kinds of relationships , " and marine property owners will eventually want to use their land for something else			0
the issue garnered national attention last year when @entity291 lawmakers petitioned @entity130 to reevaluate its findings			0
" the most recent @entity38 cod assessment threatens to further exacerbate a number of issues our fishermen already face , with potentially disastrous consequences , " sen. @entity293 , @entity1 , wrote in a letter , asking for a new assessment			1
@entity130 declined the request , citing time constraints that prevented it from conducting another report ahead of the 2012 fishing season			1
" the only real solution is more fish , " said @entity216 of @entity130			0
" unless we just decide to make fishing less efficient			0
" agency officials also point out that their assessment had been reviewed by other independent scientists and would likely yield similar results .			0

small - boat fishermen face steep cuts in cod fishing
a survey finds that @entity38 cod are in far lower numbers than experts thought
the new report suggests the stocks are depleted
the local industry could face more than an 80 % reduction from prior years ' cod catch
