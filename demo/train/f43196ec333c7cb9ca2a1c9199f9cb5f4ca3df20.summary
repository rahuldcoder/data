-- on friday , january 18 , 2008 , chess master @entity3 died at age 64 , the same number , @entity0 reader @entity1 points out , as the number of squares on a chessboard			1
@entity1 played chess and developed a friendship with @entity3 from 1992 to 1994 in @entity10			1
no cause of death was given for @entity3 , the eccentric genius who was renowned for his @entity16 defeat of @entity18 chess champ @entity17 in 1972 ; his two - decade retreat from chess ; and his trip to @entity23 in 1992 , in defiance of @entity26 sanctions , for a rematch with @entity17			1
after @entity3 beat @entity17 again , winning $ 3.5 million , he vanished from the scene once more			1
he spent his later life denouncing the @entity26 and moved to @entity30 , where he died			0
@entity0 asked readers to share their memories of @entity3 and his sometimes triumphant , often turbulent life			1
below are a collection of their responses , some of which have been edited for length and clarity			0
@entity42 of @entity43 , @entity44 @entity3 was simply the best ! his aura was the main reason i took up chess , and the more i understood about chess , the more i came to appreciate his sheer genius			1
like many others , i did have a problem with his anti-america , anti-semitic outbursts and views , but his chess playing was pure magic			2
i 'd always hoped and dreamed he would make a final appearance and play @entity60			2
what a match that would have been			0
what a loss of talent			0
@entity68 of @entity69 , @entity70 when i returned home from @entity67 , the game between @entity3 and @entity17 had just started			1
i did not play the game that well , but watching @entity3 play was a welcome home for me			1
he inspired me to learn more about the game , and in so doing , i was able to recover from the war			1
i will always remember that game and what @entity3 has done for me through the game of chess			1
@entity1 of @entity81 , @entity70 in spite of his obvious flaws , he will be remembered as " @entity84 , " a genius on the board and the man who broke through the @entity88			1
i mostly admired him as a chess player and what he did for chess			1
he put chess on the map in the @entity26 and changed the economic opportunities for chess players			2
if it were n't for him , demanding reparation and prizes in the ' 60s and ' 70s , players would n't be making the money they are today			0
he was fanatic about chess ; he was working on chess most of his life , even years and years after he retired			2
his dedication , passion and love for the game , it was his life			2
it was how he expressed himself			0
it 's symbolic that he died at age 64 , for the 64 squares of the chessboard			2
@entity116 of @entity117 , @entity115 @entity3 was a childhood hero of mine			1
his match with @entity17 resounds in my memory like the @entity123 missions , and he inspired me to learn chess			1
his book on the subject [ @entity127 ] was a focused treatment of winning chess games ( using back - rank mates )			1
it was also a wonderful example of " programmed instruction			0
" while i mourn his death , i teach college and would like to believe that a little bit of @entity3 lives on in my classroom			1
@entity138 of @entity139 , @entity140 as a chess player , i 've always been astounded by the mysterious power of @entity3 's play			1
as a chess teacher , i 've always tried to instill his courage and determination in my students			2
surely this is the darkest day in the history of chess			2
@entity150 of @entity151 , @entity152 when i was a young boy , @entity3 was no less than a hero for me			1
i am now 51 years old , and i still have the yellowed newspaper clippings of his famous match with @entity17 in my desk			0
unfortunately , @entity3 obviously suffered from mental illness that progressed as the years passed by and eventually destroyed him			1
his remarks ( ravings ) of support for the 9/11 attackers upon the @entity26 will certainly be as much of a legacy as being the @entity164 hero , and first @entity26 world chess champion three decades earlier			1
@entity3 was a genius , a hero , a villain and a very sick man			1
it 's a shame that no one could reach him many years ago and save him from himself			2
@entity171 of @entity172 , @entity173 @entity3 was my first boyfriend			1
starting about 1955 , i would go to the @entity176 chess club with my father			0
my father would play , and i would drink soda			0
i saw @entity3 a few times there , and we would talk a little			1
( we were both the same age and very shy			0
) i fell in love with him at a tournament at @entity186 , in @entity187			0
we went to the boardwalk together , went on rides and played games of chance			0
his mother was real mad at him when we got back because he was almost late for his game			0
i think it was @entity195 or @entity196 , maybe 1955 or 1958			0
the @entity186 newspaper had a picture of me watching one of his games			0
i wish i could get a copy of that picture			0
we wrote back and forth for a while , and then i got too cool for chess and he got famous			0
one time , a @entity206 friend of mine said i could n't marry him because he was @entity206 and i was n't			0
i wish i could have seen her when he converted			0
i love remembering him in such an innocent time			0
he was just a person , like you and me , with a wonderful gift ( and he was very cute )			0
if anyone can get that picture from the @entity186 newspaper , please let me know			0
i think it was on the front page , because we were only about 13 or 15 , and he won			0
@entity217 of @entity218 , @entity219 what happened to @entity3 was tragic , @entity221 in scope			2
raised in a @entity224 apartment by a single mother , he rose to take on and vanquish single - handedly the @entity18 chess behemoth			2
at age 13 , @entity3 defeated @entity227 in a game now dubbed " @entity229			2
" @entity3 deserved honor , respect and glory for his great chess achievements , not ridicule , exile and shame			1
@entity237 of @entity224 that has to be the greatest loss for all chess players			0
... i learned to play the game when he played @entity242 , and i 've been playing the game since then			0
i 've been playing chess all this time , and it 's all about fun , and @entity3 has been my inspiration			1
just a week ago , as i was trying to inspire some kids from a school to learn to play chess , i mentioned to them that @entity3 was the greatest @entity26 chess player			1
they were fascinated with the story , and it will be really hard to tell them that @entity3 has died			2
it 's a sad day			0
