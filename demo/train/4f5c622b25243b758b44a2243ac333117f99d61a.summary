@entity0 is coming forward as the latest site to be hacked			1
the social network said in a blog post friday afternoon that approximately 250,000 user accounts were potentially compromised , with attackers gaining access to information including user names and email addresses			1
the company first detected signs of an attack earlier in the week , which led to an investigation and the discovery of a larger breach			0
" this week , we detected unusual access patterns that led to us identifying unauthorized access attempts to @entity0 user data			2
we discovered one live attack and were able to shut it down in process moments later , " said @entity20 , @entity0 's director of information security , in a post			0
" however , our investigation has thus far indicated that the attackers may have had access to limited user information			0
" @entity0 has reset the passwords and revoked session tokens , which allow you to stay logged into the service without reentering a password , for all of these accounts			1
affected users will not be able to log in and will receive an e-mail instructing them to reset their password			1
the post does n't go into details about the methods the attackers used , but does refer to a recent @entity45 vulnerability			0
the @entity46 recently warned users about the issue and suggested they disable @entity45 in their browsers unless " it is absolutely necessary			1
" this attack follows major security breaches at the @entity53 and the @entity54 , which were both attributed to @entity57 hackers			1
the @entity53 suspects it was in response to negative coverage of the @entity57 prime minister @entity60 , and the @entity54 said evidence pointed to an attempt to " target the monitoring of the @entity54 's coverage of @entity57			2
" the @entity65 announced late friday that it too had experienced attacks that fit the profile in 2011 , and @entity68 acknowledged that it was targeted but said no computers were compromised			0
while the @entity0 post does not mention @entity57 or blame the hacks on any specific country or group , it does mention the news organization hacks			0
" this attack was not the work of amateurs , and we do not believe it was an isolated incident			0
the attackers were extremely sophisticated , and we believe other companies and organizations have also been recently similarly attacked , " said @entity20			0
a quarter - million accounts is a small segment of @entity0 's 200 million monthly active users worldwide			2
however the company offers tips for all of its users going forward , including using strong passwords that mix numbers and symbols with upper - and lowercase letters , not using the same password for multiple accounts , and disabling @entity45 .			1

@entity0 reports recent attack that may have compromised 250,000 user accounts
the attack is the latest against large sites , including the @entity53 and @entity54
affected users will receive an e-mail instructing them to reset their passwords
@entity0 *recommends* all users have strong passwords and disable @entity45 in their browsers
