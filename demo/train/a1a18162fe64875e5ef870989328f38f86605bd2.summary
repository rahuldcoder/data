-- inventor @entity1 admits he appears crazy -- " but it 's the crazy people who change the world			2
" " some people work on old cars , some do quilting , some collect stamps , i build jetpacks			2
" night after night for 30 years , the @entity14 father - of - two worked on a secret machine in his garage			1
@entity17 was one of the few people who knew about the space - age contraption quietly taking shape at their home in @entity22			2
luckily for @entity1 she was not only " as crazy as him , " but petite enough to be its first test pilot			2
twelve prototypes and $ 17 million later , and what started as a young university student 's hobby could soon be on the market , the first flying machine of its kind ever to be commercially sold			1
" " i wanted to fly to school as a five - year - old , " said the 54 - year - old inventor , who previously worked in marketing in the pharmaceutical industry			1
" i saw ' @entity39 , ' ' @entity40 , ' and the @entity41 when i was young			2
when @entity42 stepped onto the moon , i knew that anything was possible			0
somehow we lost that spirit			0
" everyone that is , except @entity1			0
fabulous flying machines with a wingspan of just over 2 meters , his futuristic flying machine can travel 74 kilometers per hour and soar 900 meters into the sky			1
powered by a @entity56 200 - horsepower engine , it zooms through the air on two giant ducted fans , with enough fuel to last 30 minutes			1
should the pilot let go of the controls , the jetpack will automatically hover on the spot			1
an inbuilt parachute can also be launched in an emergency			0
it might seem like an unlikely design for a man with a degree in biochemistry and physiology			1
but as @entity1 says , building things is just part of the " @entity75 " way -- referring to the nickname for people from @entity14			0
" @entity14 live outdoor lifestyles and by the time i was 20 i could ski , mountain climb , abseil , ice skate , kayak , surf , hang glide and skydive , " he explained			0
" we have a tradition of making what we need , of inventing things			0
so jetpacks are a normal extension for the people who created the jetboat and bungee jump			0
" mission impossible ? @entity1 is now on the search for investors to help get his jetpack , ahem , off the ground			1
the company needs $ 4 million in funding			1
should it succeed , the machine could be available just months later , with a price tag of around $ 150,000			1
but just what will this daring design be used for ? " our first product will be targeted at @entity110 -- fire brigades , the police , ambulance services , along with search and rescue , disaster recovery , and border control , " said the company 's chief executive , @entity107			1
" there will also be an unmanned version capable of lifting 100kg in weight			0
we 've already had interest from many other places , including mining and agricultural companies			0
" there are also plans to release the jetpack to the tourism industry and ultimately to individuals -- though its use will come down to aviation laws in each country			1
new pilots would also be required to undertake a week - long training course			0
cities of the future could we really see people flying jetpacks around our cities in the future ? " the jetpack is well - suited to operate in cities , " said @entity107			1
" without the large rotor blades similar to a helicopter , it can operate in confined spaces			0
" " there is less opportunity at present for personal jetpacks to fly around urban environments , due to regulations			2
but i think this will probably change over time as new approaches of highways in the sky for personal transport are developed			0
" for @entity1 , it would be a little boy 's dream come true			0
" i was three - years - old when @entity162 went into space , four - years - old when @entity164 completed an orbit , nine - years - old when @entity166 went to the moon , and 21 - years - old when i decided to make a jetpack , " he says			1
at 54 , he could be about to fly into the history books himself			2
watch : can this drone get you home ?			0

the ' @entity33 ' could soon be the first commercially sold jetpack
invented by @entity175 , who worked on design for 30 years in garage
looking for $ *4m* in funding to get product onto market
can fly *74kmph* , soar 900m in air , and last 30 minutes before *refueling*
