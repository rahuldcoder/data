-- house speaker @entity1 is facing a huge moment in his career			1
now that the @entity5 has passed the immigration bill , all eyes have turned to the @entity7 , where some right - wing members of the @entity9 are prepared to scuttle the bipartisan deal that has been carefully crafted in the upper chamber			1
according to @entity17 @entity9 @entity16 , " we have a minority of the minority in the @entity5 voting for this bill			2
that 's not going to put a lot of pressure on the majority of the majority in the @entity7			1
" this is a test for @entity1 , a massive opportunity for him to rebuild a languishing speakership			1
at this point , the verdict of history probably would not be very kind to him			2
@entity1 has struggled to move legislation through his chamber , as the recent embarrassing failure of the farm bill showed			1
his biggest victories have primarily been symbolic , like the legislation dealing with abortion that has no chance of passing the @entity5			2
if his goal is to bring together the various factions of his party into common accord behind key legislation , he has repeatedly failed			1
how can @entity1 have any success with immigration ? after watching the collapse of the deal with farm legislation , it seems difficult to fathom how he can stitch together a majority that will stay on board with this bill			1
when the bet is between failure and success , most @entity53 observers would bet on failure			0
yet @entity1 does have some tools at his disposal			1
most importantly , he can work with external organizations to lobby @entity61 , namely , religious and business organizations			0
both these groups have shown strong support for immigration reform and they have considerable clout in gerrymandered districts that president @entity69 can never reach			1
a large number of religious groups , including evangelical christians , have called on @entity73 to pass the reform			2
@entity75 , one of the most influential members of the religious right in recent years and who is the chairman of the @entity79 , said : " as people of faith , this is not just an economic and security issue ; it is a moral issue			0
this bill , while not perfect , is an important starting point to reforming and modernizing @entity88 immigration law so it reflects faith - based principles of compassion for the alien , the primacy of the family , respect for the rule of law , and protecting @entity88 security and sovereignty			2
" this strategy has worked before			0
when @entity100 were filibustering the @entity101 , religious organizations helped the @entity103 administration persuade @entity105 @entity9 senators to vote for cloture			0
business groups , traditionally a driving force for immigration liberalization , can also help @entity1			1
given their immense clout within the party as well as within specific districts , business groups should flex their financial muscle to pressure members into voting yes			0
@entity1 needs to threaten @entity7 @entity9 that he could work out a deal with @entity100 and moderates in the party			1
@entity1 has generally adopted a model of leadership in which he follows the lead of his caucus			2
if enough republicans do n't agree with a path to citizenship and believe that passing this legislation will threaten their majority , then he should follow their demands			0
but another model of congressional leadership is to try to shape his caucus rather than having it shape him			0
as the @entity132 political scientist @entity131 detailed in his book , " leading representatives , " there is a history of speakers , such as @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 , who have taken enormous risks to push their caucus in new directions			2
this is a strategy that could produce historic legislation			2
this is the path that speaker @entity147 took , to the chagrin of many liberals , when he worked with president @entity151 's administration to pass the tax cut of 1981			1
rather than standing in the way of the tax cut , @entity147 decided to sign on and demanded goodies for @entity157 constituencies			0
@entity7 @entity100 , who had little love for @entity151 , had little choice but to join their speaker , knowing that they were going to lose			1
with the case of immigration , @entity1 could enter into a dramatic bipartisan alliance that would leave him with much greater national clout			1
even the threat of an alliance might be sufficient to move enough conservative @entity61 , who sense that defeat is inevitable and decide that they might as well win some credit for the victory			0
finally , there is always the power of pork			0
when @entity103 , as @entity5 majority leader , had to craft a deal over the @entity177 , one of the tools he used to win over @entity181 senators to vote in ways that were helpful to him was to convince @entity184 to support a major water project in @entity186			2
today , the tools of pork are not as voluminous			0
a stringent budget and limits on earmarks have taken away some of the tools that the leadership depends on			0
yet there is still pork to go around			0
while tea party @entity9 allegedly do n't like this , nothing could be further from the truth			0
in 2011 , an investigation by @entity201 found how , despite their rhetoric , tea party @entity9 have made the same kind of demands for money in their districts as others			0
@entity210 's @entity209 , @entity7 majority leader , for instance , pressed for transportation funding in his home state even while deriding @entity73 for its spending habits			1
all these tools offer @entity1 some path and muscle to make the impossible possible			1
if the immigration bill goes down to defeat in the @entity7 it would be a huge blow to those desperately seeking a path to citizenship , to the national standing of the @entity9 and to @entity1			1
his power as a legislative leader would totally vanish , and other than tea party @entity9 , there would be little support for him			0
all speakers face historic turning points , and immigration is @entity1 's			1
the outcome of the debates will overshadow all the budget wars and everything that follows			0
whether the speaker is up to meeting this challenge remains to be seen in the coming weeks			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241 .			2

@entity241 : all eyes have turned to the @entity7 to see if immigration bill will pass
@entity241 : this is a massive opportunity for @entity7 speaker @entity1 to make history
he says @entity1 has several tools to shore up support so the key legislation can pass
@entity241 : all speakers face historic turning points , and immigration is @entity1 's
