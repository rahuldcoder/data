-- we conquered @entity2 last weekend like so many @entity4 bachelorette parties before -- cheap champagne , slot machines , grown - woman giggles			1
we stuck to the city 's party - friendly district , home of a casino , restaurants that specialize in flaming cheese and @entity15 , where we spent a long , crave - denying half - hour forcing ourselves not to order one of everything			1
some pals and soon - to - be family drove five hours to be there			2
my clan has long lived nearby , but some guests had never visited the @entity25 i 'm sure there was nervous laughter on the way in , recognition of decades of terrifying headlines			1
@entity4 has n't heard many kind words since the 1960s , and much of what 's said is rooted in reality			1
it 's a place with money trouble , population trouble , housing trouble , crime trouble ; even the most bright - eyed of the artist - farmer entrepreneurs arriving in the city wo n't deny it			1
it was a merry night , but i know some of our guests left exasperated and disappointed by the view from the expressway and the sense that we should n't stray too far from the well - lit hotel perimeter			2
i left feeling guilty , like i 'd shirked my duties as an ambassador of the @entity53 's greatest city			1
@entity4 has problems , but lack of identity and charisma is n't among them			1
its rise and fall resembles the story of other cities , but on the ground , there 's nothing like it -- exactly the trait that makes any place worth a visit			1
i miss it when i 'm gone and perpetually wish for a few more days to explore			2
but without a guide , our visitors could n't even tell where to start			0
city smackdown : @entity76 , a fine place for ' cast - offs , misfits ' i know what we should have done			1
when everybody arrived , we should 've had a pile of sunshine - yellow @entity83 made potato chips , round paczki from new @entity87 bakery and @entity89 , or maybe @entity88 , waiting			0
we could 've table hopped and ordered often : the @entity92 sandwich at @entity93 's , beef cheek pierogie at @entity95 , barbecue at @entity97 , beer at @entity99 , cheaper beer at the @entity101			1
we should 've poked our heads into each of the 52 rooms at @entity105 and requested the creme brulee , just because			0
there should 've been coneys , those chili - cheese - hot dog monstrosities best consumed on the wrong side of 2 a.m. ( or at lunch , if you 're that kind of hungry			0
) the next morning , we could 've gotten coffee and pastries from @entity115 or detoxed in the worth - the - wait crepe line at @entity117 go to @entity118			0
we should 've sent everybody home with a box of sugared goodies from @entity123 in @entity124			0
maybe we should 've planned the party a day earlier , so we could hit @entity126 , the fridays - only speakeasy			0
the next day , we could 've shopped @entity128 -- the old @entity129 specialty store recently reopened under the name @entity131 it 's still owned by a grandson of the founder , still a wise place to buy cheese			1
we might 've taken the @entity136 , a pedestrian - only greenway , straight to the @entity138			0
in all that concrete , marble and glass , it 's easy to forget it 's a city made possible by water			1
we could 've stared south at @entity145 , or crossed the bridge to @entity147 , the island playland larger than @entity149 , with elements designed by famed landscape architect @entity151 and @entity4 favorite @entity153			1
@entity4 is , unfortunately , perhaps , the artistic home of " ruin porn , " and while @entity156 and the like are worth an ogle , we really should 've stopped in the very - much - alive art deco @entity159 to spin in the lobby			1
we might 've walked up and down the streets of @entity162 and @entity163 to appreciate the glorious old houses , or the sidewalks of @entity166 to see the more modern @entity168 homes			0
we should 've stayed a day longer and gone to the @entity169			0
we could pore over each corner of @entity172 's murals and walk among @entity173 , rembrandts and @entity176 mummies			2
for another view , we 'd stop at the @entity178 , the @entity179 , @entity180 and the @entity181			0
cruising music : @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , repeat			0
we could 've at least driven through the @entity186 , the neighborhood art project by native son @entity188 , helped along by artists such as @entity190			0
we would be smarter to stop and talk to people there ; a few years ago , they generously blocked off the street for my wedding and applauded from their porches			0
i will always believe their neighborhood is a place to celebrate			0
we 'd have to set aside an afternoon for @entity202 books , four floors and a basement that smell like your favorite corner of the library and bedtime stories at grandma 's			2
my uncle calls it " the only used book store where you can go with a list , " but i 've never bothered with one			0
like a casual gambler at @entity4 's casinos , it 's probably better to set a budget and wander			1
what would we miss when we took a break ? games at @entity223 , @entity224 or @entity225 ; shows at the @entity226 or the acoustically stunning @entity227 ; music at the @entity229 , @entity230 or @entity232 's @entity231 ; classic movies ( and real , live pipe organ ! ) at the @entity234 ? the suburbs would be on the someday list -- the @entity237 and its newly born river otters , the glassblowers and re-enactors at @entity241 and @entity244 's geodesic @entity242 at the @entity245 in @entity246			2
when everybody is back with their kids in tow , maybe we 'll make a day of the @entity252 's planetarium			2
one night of partying is too short for this place , or any place			0
i live in @entity257 now , and it too , has a part of my heart			2
i would n't want it , or any of my homes , to be judged on its most dilapidated blocks , its greatest tragedies or the symbolism of its past			0
no city is so obvious			2
so i can understand if our guests drove away shaking their heads , but i wo n't let it happen again			0
they 'll be back in august for my sister 's wedding			2
@entity4 will be entering its most beautiful season , when the wind is warmer and the temperatures cooler			1
we will roll down @entity278 , the grand lane in and out , but we 'll stop often to look around , because this is @entity4 , and that is @entity4 , and this , too			1
