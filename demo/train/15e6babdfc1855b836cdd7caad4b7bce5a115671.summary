-- from wars in @entity3 and @entity4 to the fast - spreading spectre of @entity6 in the @entity7 , it 's no wonder that this week 's @entity8 in @entity9 is being called " the most important gathering of @entity8 leaders in more than a decade			1
" @entity8 leaders arriving in @entity13 will have a host of issues to deal with , so what should we expect ? in short , we should see a return to @entity8 's core mission of facing a re-emerging security threat from the east			1
@entity24 president @entity23 's push in to @entity3 has the 28 - nation alliance focused on action -- and that goes double for @entity8 's new members in the east , including @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			1
but the 65 - year - old alliance 's worries are n't limited to @entity36			2
@entity6 , the terror group that has declared an independent state in @entity38 and @entity39 in recent months , is threatening to spew violent ultra-jihadists on to @entity8 members ' streets			0
and @entity4 , @entity8 's biggest overseas commitment of troops , is in flux , so adjustments are required there as combat troops prepare to depart at the end of the year			2
last -- but by no means least -- as @entity8 looks to its future , it wants to build on its past			1
the alliance will seek to use lessons it has learned in nation - building to create advisory and training teams in a drive to carve out a role as a global security hub			1
return to core mission a rapid or readiness action plan will emerge and will likely include much of the following : 1			1
preparing thousands of troops that can be ready to deploy at 48 hours ' notice			0
@entity68 defense equipment at bases in @entity33 and the @entity71 nations			0
equipping troops for constant rotation through the bases in front line states for as long as needed -- rather than maintaining a permanent force , which would contravene the @entity78 founding act			0
extending measures for air policing of @entity8 states			0
considering an increase in @entity8 's naval presence in the waters around member states			2
the major issues on the table will include : @entity4 this is expected to be the first major topic up for discussion			0
@entity8 's role there will change as @entity94 troops draw down over the next two and a half years			2
the role of @entity97 forces in the country will shift from leading @entity4 troops in the fight to supporting @entity4 in an advisory and training role			0
asymmetric and hybrid threats @entity8 is also expected to discuss the best way to face @entity78 's new hybrid , or asymmetric style of attack -- @entity23 's sending of masked , unidentified " green men " into @entity3 to intertwine with local militias , rather than deploying a traditional invasion force of armored vehicles and tanks			1
the solutions to this challenge may include any of the following : special forces , cyberwarfare , counterinsurgency , greater intelligence gathering , or stronger border security			0
the aim is to reassure those @entity8 nations who feel most exposed to @entity23 's new nationalist - fueled expansionism -- namely @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 -- but it 's also to improve the readiness time with which troops can be deployed to defend @entity8 's interests in the east			1
@entity3 president @entity130 , who is attending the summit , will of course pay close attention to all these details , but as @entity3 is not a @entity8 member it may be of little direct benefit to him			1
the hope , of course , is that @entity23 will see @entity8 's resolve and recalibrate his westward adventurism			1
but nothing so far indicates that 's remotely close to happening			0
in the interim , @entity8 leaders are expected to discuss how they can support @entity3 democracy and strengthen security -- and also explore what further material and economic support they can offer to the war - torn country			1
@entity151 another major item on the agenda will be a discussion about @entity8 's role as a global security hub			2
the alliance is considering using its experience to build up the defense and security capacity of governments in hotspots around the world , using small teams of @entity8 advisers and trainers			1
money all @entity8 nations are obliged to commit 2 % of their gdp on defense spending , but very few do			0
the @entity94 spends 4.4 % of its gdp on defense -- and president @entity175 will be hoping to push the @entity176 to keep closer to their commitment on this issue			0
@entity6 @entity175 is also keen to get @entity8 's support for tackling the growing @entity6 menace emanating from @entity38 and @entity39			2
perhaps indicating how late this issue has raced up the agenda , discussion on the topic may get it best airing at the summit dinner amid the trappings of historic warfare at @entity13 castle			0
given the toxicity pervading discussion around @entity7 intervention , the leaders will likely be hoping they do n't leave the banquet with a bitter after taste .			0
