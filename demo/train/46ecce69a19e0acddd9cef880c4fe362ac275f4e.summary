-- if friday was a day to forget , tuesday was one to remember			2
students , faculty , staff and loved ones did just that at @entity1 on the campus of @entity3 , @entity4 , reflecting on the lives of six of its students			1
" there is a human desire to come together , to reach out to one another for love and for support , " @entity14 president @entity13 told the roughly 20,000 people packed in the stadium , according to campus police			1
" we are here because we want to share memories of the young lives struck down far too soon			1
" @entity25 was one of several speakers at the event late tuesday afternoon , capping a formal day of mourning on campus			1
some represented the @entity31 university , others spoke for religious centers based nearby , and then there was the father of one victim who spoke for his family and two others			1
while two families offered prayers for their sons ' killer , there was only one brief mention -- by a faculty member -- of @entity46 by name			1
he is the only one of the seven killed who did n't attend @entity3			1
in a 137 - page document , not to mention videos and musings on social media , the 22 - year - old hinted that years of rejection and jealousy led him to lash out against beautiful women and popular men			0
relatives of those @entity46 killed described their loved ones as caring , generous and kind			1
they wanted tuesday to be about the goodness the victims represented , not the venom connected to their demise			2
as the family of @entity70 intoned : " may we together create a peaceful world and let hatred be gone with the wind			0
" from stabbings to shootings the 20 - year - old @entity70 was one of @entity46 's roommates and first three victims -- along with 19 - year - old @entity75 and 20 - year -- old weihan " @entity76			1
each was stabbed to death			2
a friend of @entity46 's family said @entity46 recently had a feud with his roommates , complaining to his landlord that they were too noisy and played lots of video games			1
he hinted at his plans for them in his manifesto , writing in apparent reference to @entity75 and @entity70 , " i 'd even enjoy stabbing them both to death while they slept			0
" but @entity46 did n't stop there			1
he then embarked on a shooting rampage friday night , killing two young women -- @entity96 , 22 , and @entity97 , both members of the @entity100 sorority			0
@entity101 recalled tracking his 19 - year - old daughter 's @entity102 , noticing that it was moving -- perhaps to the morgue , along with her body -- though no one was answering			2
the irony , @entity101 said , is that @entity97 was exactly the kind of person who would want to help @entity46			1
she was the person who would reach out to the kids who were n't the popular kids , some of the nerdy kids , some of the kids that were a little bit like this @entity46 kid described himself as			1
" @entity46 did n't stop there , either			2
he went into a deli and killed @entity3 junior @entity124 , who was getting a sandwich			2
there was more chaos and violence that followed			0
but while 13 people overall suffered injuries , the only other person who 'd die that night was @entity46 himself			2
he was found with a gunshot wound to his head , after crashing his black @entity134			0
by then , @entity46 's mother , @entity136 , had seen the e-mailed manifesto as well as disturbing video on his @entity140 page in which her son talked about " slaughtering " women at a sorority house at @entity3 , family friend @entity135 said			1
she and her ex-husband set off from @entity145 to @entity4 , at which point they learned of a shooting			2
later , they learned that their son -- who had a history of mental health issues , and was seeing at least two therapists -- was the one behind it			0
@entity156 's parents frantically searched for son inside the gunman 's head : rejection , jealousy and a vow to kill ' beautiful girls ' victim 's father : ' it 's intolerable ' as he has been ever since his emotional and overtly political speech hours after his son 's killing , @entity124 's father , @entity169 , was the most visible and vocal of the victim 's family members at tuesday 's memorial			1
he began his remarks by reading statements on behalf of the @entity176 and @entity76 families			0
the latter expressed pride in a son they characterized as gentle , kind , loving , peaceful and thankful			0
" good for now , " the @entity76 family wrote , " until we see you in heaven			0
" then , @entity184 spoke for his own family ( even as he stressed , his views are n't those of all the victims ' families )			0
he began by remembering his son as a sweet , if determined young man , someone who would quickly get back up if he was knocked down			0
@entity184 said that his son 's death should not be in vain , imploring people and especially politicians to enact stricter gun control laws			0
he recalling telling a member of @entity199 that their condolences would n't help ; he wanted them to make a difference with policy changes so that there would n't be more parents , like himself , grieving the loss of children to senseless acts of violence			0
he rallied many in attendance tuesday to stand up and chant " not one more " -- the words he had used when addressing reporters shortly after his son 's death friday			0
" it 's intolerable , " @entity184 said friday			2
" we know what 's happening here			0
too many people have died , and it should be not one more			0
" father of shooting victim chastises politicians five revelations from the ' twisted world ' of a ' kissless virgin ' @entity0 's @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 contributed to this report .			1
