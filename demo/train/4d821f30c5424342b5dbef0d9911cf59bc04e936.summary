-- some @entity2 - @entity1 , watching the post-election unrest in @entity2 , say the tug - of - war between the people and their hardline government has come to a head after three decades			1
crowds demonstrated in @entity9 , @entity10 on monday , june 15 over the @entity2 election results			1
" i am absolutely convinced that what we are witnessing is a turning point in the history of the @entity21 , " said dr. @entity12 , professor of @entity13 and @entity14 at @entity15 in @entity16			1
" even if the @entity21 survives this crisis , it will no longer be as it used to be , " added @entity12			1
the contentious election results between conservative incumbent president @entity25 and reformist challenger @entity26 sent many @entity2 protesting in the streets , while others celebrated @entity25 's apparent victory			1
@entity30 , who has taught at @entity31 and @entity32 and identifies himself as an independent , told @entity0 that @entity25 's widespread support in rural areas and small towns was the reason for his win			1
in results announced hours after the polls closed , @entity25 received more than 62 percent of the vote , a figure hotly disputed by @entity26 's supporters			1
with the credibility of friday 's election under scrutiny , how the @entity21 of @entity2 overcomes it and reclaims its legitimacy in the eyes of some of its own citizens and the international community remains to be seen			1
" there is good reason to believe that many if not most of the @entity59 demonstrators are gladly taking an opportunity to safely protest something bigger : their enormous discontent with the entire system as it stands , " said @entity53 , a @entity54 analyst for the @entity55			2
the unstable political , social and economic climate has some scholars questioning the future of the @entity21			2
" they are either going to crack down severely or they are going to cave in -- it could go either way , " @entity12 said of the conservatives who now dominate @entity2 's government			1
many @entity2 - @entity1 say they see this as their opportunity for change			1
" this is the best chance @entity2 have to evolve to a better situation , " said dr. @entity78 , a professor at the @entity79			2
that chance has sparked an unprecedented wave of spontaneous demonstrations not only within @entity2 but also thousands of miles away from @entity84 --- scenes unparalleled since the 1979 revolution			2
" thirty years ago we had the war with @entity89			0
now we have an internal war with our president and the fundamentalists , " said @entity90 , a political analyst who worked with @entity26 when he was prime minister of iran			0
@entity90 , of @entity10 , was among thousands of voters to cast an absentee ballot			0
" this was the first time i voted in 30 years , " said @entity90			0
the enthusiasm that drove record numbers of @entity2 - @entity1 to the voting booths was overshadowed by disappointment when a shortage of ballots prevented hundreds from voting			1
in addition , the election results were announced before many of the voting booths in the @entity1 had closed			1
@entity107 , senior @entity54 analyst at @entity108 's , a provider of defense and security information , said @entity2 's supreme ruler , ayatollah @entity111 , may have miscalculated the mood of the country when he endorsed @entity25 's victory before the country 's election authority made the final call			1
@entity111 has since asked the authority , the @entity119 , to recount some of the votes			0
but @entity26 is asking for fresh elections			0
@entity90 , like many other voters , questions the legitimacy of the election			0
he wants to know where his vote went			0
a student activist in @entity127 , @entity128 , echoed that sentiment			0
" the election volunteer at my voting location said that they had 500 ballots , which was not enough for the thousand or so people that turned out to vote , " said the activist , who wanted to remain anonymous because he plans to visit @entity2 soon			1
for the first time , @entity2 - @entity1 say , the post-revolution generation has seen the power of their unity unfold in masses			1
they say this has given @entity2 at home and abroad hope that reform could be within their reach , if the ruling mullahs are willing to allow it			1
" we are seeing a rise of a new generation of @entity2 who are not taking it anymore , " said @entity12			2
" this is no longer just about this election , this is full - fledged civil disobedience , " he added			2
the divide within the @entity21 has pitted the reformists against the conservatives			2
" the big difference between these protests and the student riots of 1999 and 2001 is that we are seeing senior caliber officials like @entity26 , @entity162 and @entity163 and ayatollah @entity164 supporting the demonstrations , " said @entity107			0
@entity162 is a former @entity166 speaker			0
@entity163 and @entity164 are former presidents			0
some experts say where @entity2 is headed actually has a lot to do with its past			2
" @entity164 made no secret of his disdain for @entity25 ahead of the election , and even back in 2005 when he lost the second round runoff to @entity25 , " said @entity53			0
@entity164 is chairman of the assembly of experts and oversees the 86 - member body , which is responsible for appointing the supreme leader and monitoring his performance			0
behind closed doors , @entity2 's political parties are caught in the middle of a power struggle between supreme leader @entity111 and @entity164			1
@entity164 's role as chairman of the assembly gives him the ability to influence that body 's attitudes toward @entity111 , @entity107 said			0
that could only add more fuel to the political fire and social unrest in the streets , analysts say			0
politics aside , at the end of the day , @entity2 expatriates such as @entity198 , who participated in the historic 1979 protests , feel a sense of deja vu			1
@entity198 , now an @entity205 resident , fled @entity2 with her three children 15 years ago			2
" i want people to have a normal life , " said @entity198			0
" i want them to have freedom			0

some @entity2 - @entity1 believe the @entity21 *possibly* is *eroding*
protests in @entity2 continue after disputed presidential election
*tensions* between @entity2 's *clergy* could be a reason for the unrest , analyst says
@entity2 - @entity1 say they hope more freedom is result of unrest
