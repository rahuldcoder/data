with the book " @entity2 " still flying off the shelves , women are discovering the power of sexual fantasy , some for the first time			1
according to neuroscientists @entity9 and @entity10 , authors of " a @entity12 , " while men tend to have visually driven fantasies , women prefer to fantasize about what a man might do to them			1
for example , the top five female fantasies involve having sex with a stranger , being worshipped in bed , being ravaged in bed , being watched by others and enjoying a threesome			2
in other words , women tend to fantasize about being the object of desire			1
erotica is wonderful , but you do n't need a book to feel sexy			0
in fact , indulging in a little bit of fantasy on your own may be even more effective at spurring both sexual desire and arousal , according to a recent study			1
4 ways to rev up your post-baby sex life researchers at the @entity42 have shown that different forms of sexual fantasy may have a real impact on arousal and desire , particularly for women			1
for their study , published in the @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 randomly assigned 128 women and 98 men to one of four groups , or " arousal conditions			2
" one group completed an imagined social situation exercise in which they imagined a positive sexual encounter and then answered open - ended questions about it			0
the others engaged in typical unstructured fantasy ( imagining sexual situations but not writing about them ) , while others read an erotic story of the researchers ' choice or took part in a neutral exercise ( writing about the room they were in )			2
then they rated their perceived genital arousal ( how they felt physically ) , as well as their " state " desire ( whether they wanted to have sex )			2
the results : the first three groups all reported experiencing increased genital and psychological arousal , as well as higher " state " desire , compared with the neutral group			2
the group who engaged in unstructured fantasy had the greatest arousal			0
interestingly , though , the researchers also measured " trait " desire -- sort of a person 's general set point for sexual desire , once believed to be unchangeable -- and discovered that the imagined social situation exercise group , the ones imagining a positive sexual situation , reported significantly higher trait desire after that exercise			1
sex or money : what makes you happier ? that 's great news for all of us , but particularly for women , who often tend to experience sexual desire in response to the sex they 're already having			1
in other words , you may not feel quite so " into " sex in the beginning , but your desire and arousal grow as the interlude progresses			1
indeed , female sexual response is typically characterized by " responsive desire , " while male sexual response is more likely characterized by " spontaneous desire , " says sex educator @entity120 , author of the " @entity121 to female @entity122			0
" " ' @entity123 desire ' is when motivation to have sex begins after sexual behavior has started : you 're doing something else when your partner comes over and starts kissing you , and you think , ' oh yeah ! that 's a good idea , ' " she explains			1
" ' @entity132 " desire , more typical of male sexuality , works more like this : you 're walking down the street and for no immediately obvious reason you think , " hm			0
i 'd like to have sex ! " as the new study suggests , actively fantasizing about sex is n't just a way to pass the time			0
it can create real changes in your body , moving you from thinking about sex in the abstract to fueling real desire and arousal			0
@entity149 is also a sign of a healthy sex life , and sharing those fantasies with your partner does n't just have the potential to spice things up in the bedroom			2
it also means that you feel secure and confident in your relationship			1
it 's often been said that the brain is our biggest sex organ , and this study only confirms that			0
so , give your brain a workout with a fantasy or two			0
you might be surprised where it leads you			0
