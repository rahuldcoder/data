-- if you grew up in the 70s , 80s and 90s , there 's a good chance that whole portions of your brain are still clogged up with the jingles , catchphrases and slogans that defined a golden era of television advertising			1
but in a new age of digital , on - demand and recorded viewing , when the fast - forward button is a weapon of choice , there are signs the 30 - second tv advertisement could be on its way out , perhaps sounding the death knell for a marketing tool that became part of the cultural landscape			1
it already appears to be happening in some countries			0
in 2009 , @entity29 became the first major economy to spend more on online marketing than on television , with the internet accounting for 23.5 % of all ad money , compared to tv 's 21.9 %			1
this is bad news for tv ad connoisseurs who , as the 30 - second slot evolved from basic product promotion into a sophisticated medium producing cinematic masterpieces and some of the sharpest humor ever broadcast , have come to revere them as works of art. anyone doubting the power of these should cast their mind back to the adverts of their youth			2
there are generations of @entity56 who consider the " @entity60 " a normal way to enter a swimming pool and for whom the words " plop plop , fizz fizz ... " will always mean @entity64			0
likewise few @entity29 of a certain age can listen to @entity67 's @entity66 without thinking of deadpan cigar advertisements			1
nor can they forget the bizarre @entity70 robots that mocked earthlings for peeling potatoes rather than eat instant mash			0
and then there were the @entity77 ads. in a league of their own , these multi-million dollar wide screen epics barely made any reference to the beer they were marketing , instead relying on moodily - lit images of surfers facing tides of white horses , or convicts taming wild mustangs			0
in a post-economic crisis world , big spending on television ads now seems out of place			1
smaller budgets , coupled with new digital viewing habits , have led to numerous predictions about the imminent extinction of the 30 - second slot			2
but in a turnaround that few in the industry predicted , television advertising seems to be enjoying a renaissance , helped by rapid expansion in developing countries and by the platform that was once considered tv marketing 's sworn enemy -- the internet			1
" a lot of research is showing it is on the way back in , and if you look at some of the most successful campaigns of the past year or so , they 're all tv commercials , " said @entity110 , a former creative director at @entity119 who now runs the @entity122 agency			2
statistics produced by the @entity127 data mapping agency show that while worldwide internet advertising budgets will grow 12.5 % annually to $ 117.5 billion by 2016 , tv spending will also rise between 6 % and 9 % annually to $ 243.3 billion			1
" great tv commercials are still the epicenter of a lot of stuff , " said @entity130 , head of @entity132 - based ad agency @entity131			2
" people started inventing tech to avoid advertising so advertising has to get better which is a good thing			0
it puts the onus back on advertising to do better by the consumer			0
not just bombard them into submission , but actually earn their attention			0
inform them , entertain them , and respect them			0
" some internet developments are actually helping drive viewers back to old watching habits			0
the popularity of " double screening " -- using @entity158 or other networking tools to chronicle what they see on tv -- is believed to be boosting the size of audiences watching in real time			0
advertisers can also harness the internet to give tv slots greater impact , allowing them to focus budget on production instead of paying for air time			1
a recent ad by @entity29 dairy firm @entity173 featuring rapping farmers ran once in a primetime slot but enjoyed 1.8 million @entity177 hits			2
while the @entity56 , @entity179 @entity178 , @entity180 and @entity181 are currently the world 's largest television advertising markets , much of the industry 's growth is now focused in developing countries where internet penetration is comparatively low			1
@entity188 , associate professor of media communications at @entity190 in @entity191 and author of " marketing in @entity194 , " says television still counts for up to 80 % of advertising budgets in nations like @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity178 , @entity200 and @entity201			2
" it is still a growth area in these countries , but they are still lacking in terms of expertise and technical abilities , " he said			0
" @entity208 is big and with radio it is the dominant form , and i do n't think we 're going to see what we see in the @entity213 with the internet			1
" but , says @entity215 , chief executive of @entity216 -- the world 's largest advertising group -- this could change as cell phones offer cheap ways to access the internet , even in developing countries , and thus a perfect new platform for advertising			1
" it is true in the @entity213 , internet and mobile new media , social networking is more important from an advertising and marketing services point of view , but the speed of adaptation of the faster - growing markets is going to be greater because mobile has leapfrogged the pc as a cheap form of accessing the internet , " he said			1
such developments are n't worrying the ad men just yet			0
says @entity110 , even as technology advances , advertisers should n't forget that many people still choose to passively consume television in the old fashioned way			0
" people are still sitting there comatose in front of the tv and it 's a really good place to flog stuff to them			2
