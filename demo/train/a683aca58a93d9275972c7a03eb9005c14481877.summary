now 82 , @entity6 is suffering from @entity7 -- a common cause of dementia , a spokesman for his daughter told @entity0 on tuesday			1
and his children say they do n't know where he is			2
a family battle has left @entity6 's children and a judge worried about his safety			1

" if you see him , if you know his whereabouts , if you hear anything about him , please , call the police			2
... this is terrible for his health			0
a man in his condition should not continually be moved			0
he 's probably very afraid , and he 's not getting proper medical care			2
" sisters @entity16 and @entity45 told @entity0 they last visited their father a week ago in the nursing home where he was staying			1
" we spent a wonderful few hours with him there , " @entity45 told " @entity51 " on tuesday			0
" he was able to smile			0
he was able to say , ' i love you			0
' when we said , ' we 'll be back , @entity23 , we 'll be back , ' he looked at us and said , ' when ? ' " she said			0
" there 's so much more meaningful communication we can have with him , and we want him back			2

and he feeds off of that love , and we feed off his love , and we want him back			1

lewy body dementia is the second most common type of progressive dementia after @entity93 's , according to the @entity94			0

daughter @entity45 and her husband , dr. @entity107 , filed the previous conservatorship petition , claiming the retired radio host " has been isolated from his daughters , friends and other family " by his wife			1
in november , @entity101 offered a very different description			2
" these children single - handedly and irreparably shattered the lives of their father , his wife and youngest daughter , the calm of their home and their neighborhood by engaging in uncalled for public demonstrations and personal attacks in the media , " she said in court papers , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity117			1
" they are doing so with a professionally orchestrated media and legal campaign that has disgraced their father and vilified their stepmother			0
" the children " falsely claim that their stepmother is wicked and is keeping her husband prisoner in his home behind closed doors and that they no longer have access to him through no fault of their own , " she added			0
" ... for reasons they know all too well , their presence at this state would be toxic and extremely distressing for @entity6 , @entity101 and their daughter , @entity149 , who have had enough of their cruelty			1
" in december , @entity16 told @entity0 that her stepmother was preventing @entity6 's children from visiting their ailing father			1
" it 's been a very long time			0
we were n't blindsided by this , " she said at the time			0
" this is a man we saw every single week , talked to him every single day on the phone until he lost his voice			0
we are an extremely close knit family , extremely , and his family means more to him than anything , " " we tried everything to get her to let us see him when she stopped bringing him over to the house			0
she had an assistant bring him over to the house so we could see him every weekend			0
my sister went there , knocked on the door and she was escorted off the property			0
" the petition last year said that @entity45 and her husband had been unable to check on @entity6 's health even though her father signed papers in 2007 giving them the power of attorney over his heath care in the event he was unable to make his own health decisions			1
they " have been prevented from exercising their duties " by @entity101 , who has been married to the retired radio host for three decades , the filing said			1
" there is no communication between @entity101 and us and his daughters , " said brother @entity195			2
" we have no knowledge of how he is , what he 's doing , if he 's better , if he 's worse , and we 're scared that we 'll never see him again			0
" @entity6 , who for decades hosted radio music countdown shows " @entity206 " and " @entity207 , " retired in 2009			2
