@entity0 -- thousands of demonstrators bracing for the possibility of a police crackdown stood their ground in the heart of @entity0 on tuesday			1
protesters had masks , protective goggles and plastic raincoats on hand as they camped out on the main thoroughfare leading into the city 's central business district			1
" they 're all ready just in case there is any sort of move by the @entity0 police , " @entity1 's @entity15 reported			1
it 's been more than a day since officers fired tear gas and pepper spray at the crowd			0
at least 56 people have been injured so far in the largely student - led protests , which flared into violence starting sunday , a @entity0 government spokeswoman said			1
the head of the @entity0 government urged protesters to clear roads tuesday , saying they are impeding any emergency vehicles that may need to pass			1
" the main roads are used by fire trucks and ambulances			0
they now have to take a detour , so we urge the society to think about this , " @entity0 chief executive @entity38 told reporters			1
demonstrations began in response to @entity47 's decision to allow only @entity49 - vetted candidates to stand in the city 's 2017 election for the top civil position of chief executive			0
protesters say @entity49 has gone back on its pledge to allow universal suffrage in @entity0 , which was promised " a high degree of autonomy " when it was handed back to @entity47 by @entity57 in 1997			1
@entity38 said tuesday that @entity47 will not back down from its position on @entity0			1
" @entity47 will not compromise to the illegal threats of some people , " he said			2
" based on the basic law , we will be able to have one person , one vote universal suffrage			0
@entity47 's decision is based on and using what the basic law allows them to do			0
" " i understand this universal suffrage is somewhat different to what the public thinks it would be , " he added			0
" but this is based on the basic law			0
we still want to remain peaceful , calm and think what the best is for @entity0			1
" but the protesters , rallying against what many see as the growing influence of the @entity80 on the way @entity0 is run , are so far refusing to budge			1
both protesters and police have been calling for calm , @entity15 said			1
and at the moment , the situation is peaceful			0
chanting protesters are calling for the resignation of @entity0 chief executive @entity38			1
a large orange banner hanging over them , @entity15 reported , says " freedom in the midst of a storm			0
" demonstrators say they 're not going anywhere			0
authorities also do n't seem to show any sign of backing down ; officials in @entity0 and @entity47 say it 's an illegal gathering			1
" the next step really at this stage is very difficult to predict , " @entity15 said			0
@entity38 said the organizer of @entity103 said demonstrators would be asked to stop the protest if it gets out of control			0
" i now urge them to call a stop to this , " @entity38 said			0
" i respect how the public voice their political opinions , but i would like you to take care of the safety of the public			0
" @entity0 protests : in the thick of it what you need to know police action shocks residents the protests have brought widespread disruption to the heart of one of @entity127 's biggest financial centers , blocking traffic on multi-lane roads and prompting the suspension of school classes			1
on tuesday , 37 branches or offices of 21 banks were closed , the @entity132 said			1
it said atm services were also disrupted in some areas			0
police say they 've arrested 89 people since protests began , accusing them of forcible entry into government premises , disorderly conduct in public , assaulting police officers and obstructing police			1
the large - scale demonstrations now taking place grew out of student - led boycotts and protests that began last week			2
the demonstrations increased in size over the weekend after gaining the support of @entity103 with @entity154 and @entity155 , a protest group that was already planning to lead a campaign of civil disobedience later this week against the @entity47 government 's decision			0
images of heavy - handed treatment of protesters by police shocked many residents of @entity0 , where large - scale , peaceful protests are common , but police crackdowns are not			1
@entity1 's @entity168 -- who himself was enveloped in a cloud of stinging tear gas sunday -- said protesters and police appeared unused to the method of crowd control			1
" both sides were appealing for calm , and then the tear gas just exploded in the midst of everybody , " he said			0
" people here have never been hit by tear gas before , and it comes as quite a shock to them -- even the use of pepper spray			2
... this is a big shock for a city that is famed for its law and order			0
" the strong police response appeared to stir thousands more people into joining the demonstrations , swelling the ranks of protesters around the government headquarters and starting new rallies in other key areas of the city , including the densely populated district of @entity200 , which sits on the opposite side of @entity202 from @entity203			1
" they should n't have used tear gas , " said @entity204 , 37 , who works in human resources and was n't protesting			2
" this made people angry			2
" as the sun rose over @entity0 on tuesday , @entity168 reported that groups of pro-democracy demonstrators were sleeping in the street after occupying the main highway in downtown @entity0 for the second night in a row			1
at the main protest site near the government headquarters , a young woman named @entity217 told @entity1 she has no plans to leave			0
" as long as there 's one person that 's still out here on this highway , " she said , " i 'm going to be here			0
" ' @entity227 revolution ' despite the government 's announcement that it had pulled riot police back from the protest sites , smaller numbers of officers remained on guard on the sidelines of the main protest area			2
aside from the clashes with police , the protesters have remained overwhelmingly peaceful			1
people have been picking up trash left at the protest sites , handing out bottles of water and encouraging police officers to put down their weapons and join the demonstrations			1
in the face of tear gas and pepper spray , demonstrators have used goggles , homemade masks and umbrellas to protect themselves			1
how @entity0 remains distinct from @entity47 the abundance of umbrellas among the crowds , shielding people from tear gas and the fierce glare of the sun , has prompted many social media users to dub the movement the " umbrella revolution			1
" @entity266 - man , a leader of @entity103 , told @entity1 's @entity267 that demanding the chief executive 's resignation is a realistic goal that could give @entity0 a window to restart constitutional reform efforts " we should n't look at the democracy movement as a battle			2
it is a war , " he said			0
" as long as the spirit of democracy is alive , we are not and we will not be defeated			0
" ' we had to use force ' fears nonetheless remain about the possibility of a heavier crackdown from authorities			2
both the @entity47 and @entity0 governments have said they consider the protests to be unlawful			1
@entity38 has said police have acted with the greatest possible restraint in dealing with the protesters			2
at least 12 police officers were among the injured , authorities said			2
@entity0 chief executive : raw emotion ' will get us nowhere ' " we gave them enough of a chance to leave , and this included warnings , " assistant police commissioner @entity295 said of protesters at a news conference monday			1
" but when they failed , we had to use force			0
" police fired a total of 87 tear gas canisters on sunday night , he said			0
in an indication authorities do n't expect the demonstrations to end soon , the @entity0 government said it was canceling the city 's annual fireworks display on wednesday , @entity47 's @entity313 , because of the protests			1
" everybody is in completely unknown territory			0
... how these things end , we just do n't know , ' said @entity319 , an associate fellow at @entity321 - based @entity320			0
" a lot will depend on the attitude of the authorities , and whether at some time there will be room for somebody to talk to somebody			0
" what will @entity49 do ? some analysts say they see little hope of compromise between the committed protesters and the @entity80 , which remains notorious for its ruthless suppression of pro-democracy protests in @entity49 's @entity336 in 1989			2
" i see no way the @entity47 government can tolerate what is happening in @entity0			2
greatly fear this will end badly , " tweeted @entity341 , a senior fellow at the @entity343 - @entity342 at the @entity344 , who covered the @entity336 crackdown for @entity1			0
pro-democracy activist and former legislator @entity348 told @entity1 's @entity168 that @entity47 had troops stationed in @entity0 who could clear the streets if ordered to			1
" but @entity0 people , i think , many of them would not be scared			1
i certainly would not be scared			0
and i 've said it before and i say it again , if i see a tank from the @entity47 troops in @entity0 , i would get myself a bicycle and stand right in front of it , " @entity348 said			2
@entity47 authorities appeared to be taking steps to restrict the flow of information into the mainland about what was happening in @entity0			2
state media gave little coverage to the story , and it appeared censors had blocked access to @entity373 after images of the protests flooded the photo - sharing app. @entity378 , a spokeswoman for the @entity47 @entity379 , said monday that @entity49 fully believes in and firmly supports the @entity0 government 's " ability to handle the situation in accordance with the law			1
