@entity0 -- when @entity3 boarded an inter-city bus bound for @entity0 from her native @entity5 friday morning , she did not anticipate the storm it would spark within @entity8			1
the public bus she boarded normally carries @entity11 passengers and travels to an @entity11 neighborhood in @entity0			1
as a matter of custom women sit in the back portion of the bus , because the @entity11 avoid mingling of the sexes according to their beliefs			1
she was the first passenger that morning on the bus and took a seat behind the driver			1
as the bus took on more passengers along its route , an ultra-orthodox man demanded she should sit in the back of the bus as is the custom on that route			2
" i heard him call me ' @entity39 , ' " @entity3 wrote on her @entity34 page , referencing a @entity36 term for a @entity38 woman			2
" he demanded i sit in the back of the bus , because @entity42 men could n't sit behind women ( ! ! ! )			1
" " this is my home town of @entity5 , i live in an @entity8 democracy , people can not tell me where to sit on a bus			1
" an argument ensued and ultimately the bus driver called the police to intervene , but not before a crowd of black - clad ultra-orthodox men had gathered outside the bus			2
" i was starting to get scared , to tell you the truth , " @entity3 recalled			0
" there were like 20 of them , all wearing black			0
most of them were just curious , but they were definitely on his side			0
" @entity3 snapped throughout this disruption , and said she was comfortable knowing that @entity8 law was on her side			1
in a case brought by an @entity8 woman earlier this year , the country 's @entity67 ruled that involuntary separation between the sexes on public buses was against the law			1
the responding police officer tried to talk to everyone and calm things down			0
@entity3 said he asked if she was willing to show respect for the objectors and move to the back of the bus			1
she refused and , after a 30 - minute delay , the bus moved on to @entity0 with her sitting up front			0
a day after posting the account on @entity34 , @entity3 's story was picked up by the @entity8 media , which has been devoting a lot of coverage to the public outcry over the growing political power of the @entity11 in @entity8 , and fears they are forcing the generally secular @entity8 public to adopt their religious standards			1
@entity8 's largest circulation newspaper put her story on its front page with the headline , " they wo n't @entity98 , " and compared @entity3 to the @entity102 civil rights movement 's legendary @entity100			1
on sunday , @entity8 prime minister @entity103 brought up her story in his weekly cabinet meeting			0
" up until this day we have agreed to live in peace with mutual respect by all sectors of the @entity8 society , " he told his government ministers			2
" in recent days we witness attempts to break this coexistence apart			0
today , for example , i have heard of an attempt to move a woman from her seat on a bus			0
i believe we must not allow margins groups to break our common denominator and we must keep our public spaces open and safe for all of our citizens			0
we must find the uniting and mediating ground rather than the things that divide and separate us			0
@entity3 also received a call from @entity8 's opposition leader , @entity127 , who offered her support and called her a symbol of determination against " anti-democratic radicalization that pushes women away from the public space			1
" a spokesman for @entity137 , the transportation company that runs the bus line , told @entity1 in a statement that it " does not deal with seating arrangements " on its buses and that " even if there are population groups that prefer to sit separately due to their beliefs , it is a voluntary choice and does not bind the other passengers			2
" @entity3 describes herself as secular and said she did not ride the bus looking for a confrontation			2
she said what motivated her to write about her experience was not " not to declare the @entity151 as pure evil and the oppressors of human rights and liberties , " but to point out what she sees as societal problem in @entity8			0
" there are a lot of lovely things about religion , but forcing people to choose religion is wrong , " she said			0
" it is wrong to use religion as an excuse to eliminate people 's basic rights : the right for freedom and the right for dignity			0
