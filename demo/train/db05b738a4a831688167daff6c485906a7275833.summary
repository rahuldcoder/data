-- not long ago camel milk was an unfancied staple , the preserve of @entity4 herders			1
however companies in the @entity6 have recently been positioning camel products as the stuff of luxury			1
upscale department stores like @entity13 's @entity12 's now stock camel milk chocolate and it might not be long before camel milk ice cream , cheese , hot dogs -- and even camel leather handbags -- follow suit			1
" currently , we are exporting our camel milk to @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and the @entity34 , with quite positive outcomes , " says @entity20 , the deputy general manager at @entity22 , one of the @entity6 's camel milk producers , and a brand owned by the @entity26 for @entity27 ( @entity28 )			1
in the last few years , @entity22 ' product line has exploded			0
they recently launched the world 's first camel milk cheese , and their herd of camels has grown from a few hundred in 2006 to 4,200 as of today			1
their sister company , @entity43 , @entity46 's own luxury brand of camel milk chocolate , recently developed camel milk gelato			1
" we are pioneers in our field and pretty much anything we do is a ' first - time - ever , ' " says @entity20			0
other brands have started to capitalize on local camel - mania			2
@entity46 coffee shop @entity54 made international headlines with its " camelccinos " and camel lattes , @entity59 style drinks made with camel milk			1
@entity27 meat also features prominently on the menu , which serves up camel fajitas , hot dogs , burgers and salami			1
@entity54 founder @entity67 also created a sub-brand called @entity69 , which will stock @entity46 's supermarkets with camel retail products , including meat ( an industry first )			2
" i said , ok , let 's go global with a camel revolution , and we 'll enter as a pioneer of the @entity84 © , " says @entity67 , who has franchised versions of @entity54 in @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			2
over the hump @entity27 is not the easiest product to work with			2
as a meat , it tends to be lean and tough -- not the most amenable for hot dogs and burgers			0
the milk is also half the fat of cow 's milk -- a quality that makes it ideal for the health conscious but less so when you 're concocting a recipe for chocolate			0
" it 's not easy for chocolate producers , because the fat does affect the taste , " admits @entity100 , @entity43 's general manager			0
" we did a lot of trial and error in product development			0
we have really good , very experienced chocolate makers and without them we would n't have been able to overcome it , but we 're over that hurdle			0
" @entity67 noted he had similar obstacles when crafting recipes from camel meat			2
in the end , he decided to mix the meat with fat from the hump to even out the consistency			0
advocates of camel milk tend to cite its many health properties			1
@entity20 points out that camel milk is not only lower in fat than cow 's milk , it 's three - to five - times higher in vitamin c and easier to digest -- making it a suitable replacement for the lactose intolerant			2
this , he notes , is one reason the product has soared in popularity			0
the advent of camel products was given a boost last year when the @entity137 agreed to accept camel milk imports from the @entity6 ( meat is still pending )			1
since then , @entity140 has expanded its reach considerably			0
" @entity27 milk is a product that is widely unknown in the markets we are aiming to enter , but awareness is steadily increasing , " says @entity20			1
" we are very optimistic that our milk will convince through quality and health benefits			0
we are paving the way			0

@entity27 milk and meat products have become *trendy* in the @entity6
shops sell everything from camel hotdogs to camel milk gelato
camel products are going global ; the @entity137 allowed for camel milk trade last year
