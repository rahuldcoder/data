in a knife fight of a congressional hearing , @entity1 commissioner @entity0 defended his agency , but he sparked an uproar from @entity6 by admitting it destroyed a key hard drive wanted in an investigation , and he did not apologize for the data loss			1
" i do n't think an apology is owed , not a single email has been lost since the start of this investigation , " @entity0 told a dais full of skeptical @entity6 members on friday			1
he argued the @entity1 has done its best to find the emails that originally went missing in 2011			1
those emails are central to an investigation of why the agency targeted tea party and other political groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax - exempt status			1
the hearing by the @entity6 - led @entity26 focused on the week - old revelation from the @entity1 that a hard drive belonging to a former top agency official at the center of the congressional probe , @entity32 , crashed in 2011			1
tens of thousands of her emails saved on it dating to 2009 were destroyed			2
@entity32 and that time frame are critical in the investigation			0
the targeting issue has its roots in the 2010 rise of the tea party and the @entity44 decision , which bolstered the ability of independent groups to engage in political activity			0
@entity32 ran the division in charge of tax - exempt status and is the highest - ranking official directly connected to the targeting so far			0
she has since retired and refused to testify before @entity52 on the matter , citing her constitutional rights against having to do so			0
the @entity26 charged her with contempt of @entity52 for her refusal to speak			0
@entity1 pushes back @entity0 told lawmakers on friday that not only has the agency tried to retrieve the @entity32 emails , but he also pushed back at @entity6 reports that emails of six other @entity1 employees , including a former chief of staff , are missing			1
" it turns out ... that none of ( the chief of staff 's ) emails appear to be lost , " @entity0 said , scolding the @entity6 on the committee			1
" piecemealing out information about a possible problem simply results in press releases and angry letters to me			0
" for their part , republicans were blistering			0
they expressed frustration that has built up for the past week			0
" the @entity77 people have no reason to trust the @entity1 ... on this issue , " said @entity26 chairman @entity75			2
the @entity80 @entity6 pressed @entity0 on whether his agency knows exactly where the destroyed hard drive ended up			1
he replied that he was not sure if there was a serial number attached to the hard drive and that it was destroyed three years ago			1
republicans drilled down on when the @entity1 knew about the hard drive problems			1
time line key the time line from @entity0 was nuanced			0
he said the agency knew in february that there was some kind of problem with @entity32 's hard drive , but that it took until late april or may to determine that the hard drive crash had erased data			1
why did n't he tell @entity52 sooner ? @entity0 responded that the agency was trying to retrieve as many lost emails as possible first but decided to notify lawmakers after receiving a letter from the @entity102 last friday			1
the committee indicated that it had completed its investigation and was doing a final check to make sure the @entity1 had sent every available @entity32 email			2
@entity0 also pointed out that emails about the @entity32 hard drive crash had been included in large bundles of documents , tens of thousands at a time , that the agency sent to congressional committees last fall			1
" we 've provided the information , " @entity0 began to say under questioning by @entity115 @entity6 @entity114			2
" you have not provided us the information ! " @entity114 blasted back			0
" at this point why should anyone believe you ? ... this is the most corrupt and deceitful @entity1 in the history ! " not to be believed the outcry continued , leading to one of the most contentious exchanges of the day			1
" this is unbelievable ! " exclaimed a visibly irate rep. @entity126 , a @entity127 @entity6			2
" the apology should be to the @entity77 people			0
i do n't believe it			0
" @entity0 , whose tone was sharp and defensive at times , responded that he has had a long career in government			0
" and that is the first time anybody has said they do not believe me , " he said			0
" i do n't believe you , " @entity126 repeated			0
" that 's fine , " @entity0 said			0
" we can have a disagreement			0
" @entity147 defended the @entity1 as an agency overloaded with work and underfunded by @entity52 , and accused @entity6 of turning the hearing into a political tribunal			1
" was ( @entity32 's ) hard drive crash a conspiracy ? no , " said rep. @entity154 of @entity80 , the top @entity155 on the panel			1
" the prevailing conspiracy in this matter is that of the @entity6 's desire to stir their base , tie the problem to the @entity26 and keep up this drumbeat until the november election			2
" at one point @entity147 rep. @entity165 of @entity166 gave the @entity1 leader friendly advice to take a deep breath before speaking			2
what 's up with the @entity1 emails ? key questions about the controversy			2
