-- the @entity1 is set to make it easier for more federal prisoners sentenced for crack cocaine offenses to get clemency applications into the bureaucratic pipeline			1
attorney general @entity7 said monday that expanded criteria will soon be put in place , and anticipates a sharp increase in the number of eligible petitioners			1
inmates seeking a reduced or suspended sentence must first ask the department for relief , and those applications are then reviewed by the president			0
the pending changes are the latest step in an ongoing effort to remedy the once - common wide disparity in sentences handed down over powder versus crack cocaine , based on guidelines first enacted by @entity27 more than 25 years ago			1
the issue has been a major policy priority for @entity7 and president @entity30			2
in addition to the clemency angle , the administration has been pushing to give prosecutors more flexibility in certain non-violent criminal cases , and recommending rehabilitation instead of warehousing of prisoners			2
" the @entity43 has indicated it wants to consider additional clemency applications to restore a degree of justice , fairness and proportionality for deserving individuals who do not pose a threat to public safety , " said @entity7 in a videotaped message posted on the department 's website			1
" the @entity1 is committed to recommending as many qualified applicants as possible for reduced sentences			1
" @entity7 : i back a plan to reduce some drug - related sentences the department later this week promised more specifics on the new criteria , including how it will handle an expected flood of clemency requests			1
@entity30 three years ago signed the @entity63 to address the larger issue			0
and last december , he commuted the sentences of eight federal inmates convicted of crack cocaine crimes , concluding those offenses that did not justify such lengthy prison terms			1
the issue has racial overtones , since @entity71 figures in 2006 showed african - americans made up nearly 82 percent of defendants sentenced in federal court for dealing crack , but only 27 percent of those sentenced for dealing powder cocaine			2
in 2011 , federal courts dealt with more than 10,000 cocaine sentences a year , roughly evenly divided between crack and cases involving the powdered substance			1
until the changes started nearly a decade ago , the sentencing guidelines provided for a 100 - to - 1 ratio between the penalties for crack cocaine offenses versus those for powdered cocaine			1
dealing 5 grams of crack meant some defendants could get as much prison time as someone who dealt 500 grams of powder			0
the 100 - to - 1 factor had long been a source of contention between government prosecutors and civil rights advocates , who argued crack dealers were targeted for longer prison terms because that drug is prevalent in urban and minority communities , while the powdered version is more commonly associated with higher - income users			0
actions taken by the president , lawmakers , and the @entity71 -- an independent federal agency that advises all three branches of government on sentences -- served to cut the gap in recommended prison time for offenses involving the two varieties of cocaine			2
in the private sector , @entity118 has fought for changes in mandatory cocaine penalties for years			0
the fair sentencing law changed the 100 - to - 1 disparity between minimum sentences for crack and powder cocaine to 18 to 1			1
the @entity71 subsequently voted to make the reduced crack penalties retroactive , which meant more than 12,000 current inmates are eligible to request reduced sentences			1
previous presidential administrations had argued that @entity27 made a special point of creating the 100 - to - 1 ratio to send a tough message to crack dealers			0
the harsher sentences came after a social epidemic of crack cocaine began destroying many urban areas in the 1980s			2
@entity27 then established guidelines to ensure relatively consistent sentences for federal criminal defendants			0
but the @entity142 in 2005 concluded that while the guidelines are constitutional , they should nevertheless be considered " advisory , " not mandatory			0
judges could consult them as needed when imposing sentences and their decisions would be given deference on appeal , so long as they were not " unreasonable			0
" congressional lawmakers -- republicans and @entity152 -- then went back in 2006 with various bills that eventually reduced the disparity in cocaine sentences			2
nevertheless , said @entity7 , " there are still too many people in federal prison who were sentenced under the old regime -- and who , as a result , will have to spend far more time in prison than they would if sentenced today for exactly the same crime			0
this is simply not right			0
" @entity0 's justice reporter @entity165 contributed to this report .			0

attorney general @entity7 said new criteria would be put in place soon
he anticipates a sharp increase in the number of inmates eligible to apply
