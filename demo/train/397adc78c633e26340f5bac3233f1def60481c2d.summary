@entity0 -- @entity2 was the enigmatic leader of the most enigmatic country on earth			2
much about @entity2 's life was , and is , shrouded in mystery			1
even the year of his birth -- 1942 -- has been contested by knowledgeable sources in @entity10 and @entity11 , who claim @entity2 was born a few years earlier but that his official birth date was pushed back to make him exactly 30 years younger than his father , @entity14 's founding leader , @entity13			1
@entity14 claim @entity2 was born on @entity15 , along the @entity14 border with @entity17 , at a " secret base camp " where his father was leading a guerrilla war against @entity14 's @entity22 overlords			1
almost everyone else believes @entity2 was born in @entity11 , at a @entity25 military camp near @entity26 where his father had gone into retreat with other @entity14 and @entity17 communist guerillas			1
but the myth of @entity2 's guerilla - base birth became full - blown propaganda when he was anointed heir apparent in the early 1980s			1
after seeing instability and communist backsliding in @entity11 and @entity17 following the deaths of @entity36 and @entity37 respectively , @entity13 chose his son as successor to ensure continuity for @entity14 's political system			1
in some ways , the elder @entity2 was all too successful			2
@entity2 led @entity14 not to reform and opening , like his @entity17 contemporaries , but through economic catastrophe , famine and repeated nuclear confrontations with the @entity48			1
through all of this , the rule of the @entity50 , the @entity51 and the @entity2 family has been absolute and ubiquitous			2
when @entity2 took over the reigns of power following his father 's death in 1994 , he had been preparing for succession for more than two decades			2
after graduating from @entity59 in 1964 , @entity2 rose through the ranks of the @entity50 , focusing on culture and propaganda			0
as he candidly admitted to a conference of party workers in 1996 , economics was never his strong suit			0
he enjoyed film and the arts , fine food and drink , and kept late hours , but he was not the unstable and intellectually vacuous playboy of @entity10 propaganda			0
he certainly lacked the charisma and outgoing personality of his father , but foreign officials who met him -- including @entity10 president @entity77 , @entity22 prime minister @entity78 and @entity48 secretary of state @entity79 -- described him as intelligent , well - informed , even charming			0
on the other hand , his country 's reputation for unpredictability and provocation was often well - deserved , as @entity14 went through a series of confrontations with the @entity48 and the international community over nuclear development , and the economic situation lurched from crisis to crisis			2
@entity14 held two nuclear tests , in 2006 and 2009 , in defiance of international condemnation and @entity97 sanctions			0
a year ago @entity14 artillery shelled a @entity10 island in a confrontation over @entity10 military exercises , bringing the two sides to the brink of open warfare			2
at the same time , the economic situation -- though much improved since the famine years of the late 1990s -- remains highly precarious			0
if the outside world saw @entity2 as an enigma and a rogue , his reputation within @entity14 is more difficult to assess			1
of course , internal @entity14 propaganda built up @entity2 as a hero of near - superhuman abilities , venerated by all his countrymen			1
but defectors ' reports suggest the view of @entity2 within his own country is more mixed , and while his father is still widely revered , @entity2 is associated with the trauma of famine and crisis in the late 1990s			0
@entity2 oversaw limited steps toward economic reform in the early 2000s , but these have since been scaled back			0
the composition and direction of the @entity128 leadership is murky			0
@entity2 's son and heir apparent , @entity131 , is even more a mystery than his father was when he came to power			1
it seems likely that in the immediate aftermath of @entity2 's death , @entity14 will be run by a collective leadership , perhaps headed by @entity2 's brother - in - law @entity138 , as @entity131 is prepared to assume official power			1
no one outside @entity142 's inner circle knows what kind of leader @entity131 will be and where he will take the country			0
if @entity14 survives the @entity128 transition and its circumstances improve , @entity2 may be remembered as a leader who guided @entity14 through a disastrous period and prepared the way for reform			1
if things go badly , @entity2 will be seen as the man who oversaw the unraveling of the system his father built and as the face of a failed dynastic communism			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			0

@entity159 : @entity2 's life was so mysterious there was even *doubt* about birth year
@entity165 made @entity2 successor to *forestall* change that followed deaths of @entity37 , @entity36
@entity159 : @entity170 was one of @entity2 's *weaknesses* , and @entity14 suffered *greatly*
*performance* of @entity2 's son could decide the fate of @entity14 's dynasty
