-- it must have been a galling week for the @entity3 president			1
while presiding over a safe , well - run @entity10 , president @entity5 's key foreign policy objective -- to hold sway over @entity8 's place in the world -- has slipped through his fingers			1
at the very moment of his crowning @entity14 glory , @entity5 probably had the second worst week of any world leader -- after @entity16			1
it is tiring to repeat truisms but this is not the @entity20 and @entity21 is not the @entity23 mark ii -- not with 2 % of the world economy and a tanking workforce population			1
yet in spite of such disadvantages , @entity21 still desires respect , seeks attention and makes claims to greatness			1
and in many respects , @entity21 really is a " great " country : historically , culturally and geographically			1
a stroll around @entity34 and @entity35 attests to this			0
so does the character of its people			0
unfortunately , in the eyes of the @entity3 leadership , true greatness requires something more : the ability to dominate in many areas ( technological , military etc. ) , but particularly geopolitically in large parts of the @entity48 and @entity49			1
and in its former empire above all			0
but this need for control over neighboring states is having precisely the opposite of its intended effect			0
it 's too expensive for a start			1
the $ 3 billion it has spent so far in sweet - talking @entity8 to stick with @entity21 is n't coming back			1
and that would have come in handy for much - needed social and infrastructural projects -- and for keeping key officials loyal to the @entity63			0
but far more than money , there 's an even more important reason why attempts at influence are having the opposite effect : in the long run , it ca n't work			1
it is to the @entity72 's immense and rare credit that post-soviet state sovereignty has been a bedrock of policy since 1991			0
the five countries of @entity77 , the three countries of the @entity79 , the three @entity80 , @entity81 and even @entity82 are universally recognized as independent countries			0
true , the @entity72 wobbles at times			0
the @entity85 government has been particularly weak of late in its unwillingness to confront @entity21 in case it desists from enhancing business cooperation			1
but by and large the @entity72 has stuck to this one principle well - at least rhetorically			0
@entity21 , on the other hand , can not bring itself to do this even in words , let alone in actions			2
naturally , everyone is now nervously looking to @entity5 for his next move			2
the press writes about the worst - case scenario , the most extreme course of action possible			0
and since @entity21 did cross international borders in anger in 2008 , this is understandable			2
but @entity8 2014 is not @entity103 2008			0
military intervention in @entity8 would undo @entity21 's methodical work in discrediting the previous @entity107 government in @entity103 and justifying its actions ( protecting ' @entity3 ' citizens ) not to mention its recent diplomatic agility in @entity111			1
these are " achievements " worth protecting			0
reputation matters to @entity21 , as @entity114 showed			2
a @entity3 military response with little certainty of success ( unlike @entity103 ) is a nice fantasy for @entity3 hawks , but it would shatter @entity21 's chances of exerting influence anywhere else			1
so what then ? trade restrictions ? gas cut - offs ? fomenting trouble in @entity127 ? @entity21 does most of these already -- and will continue to do so			2
but there are no fresh moves left			0
@entity21 has lost this round , but it will live to fight another day , even as more and more statues of @entity132 fall in the former provinces			2
the other reason for @entity21 's objection to @entity8 's revolution is that " this could happen to us			1
" the thought that @entity16 's fate -- or @entity141 's or @entity142 's -- could one day be theirs , can not be a pleasant one			0
clearly @entity5 is far from the extraordinarily inept politician that the @entity8 president was			2
but who knows how much ? @entity21 learns fast and is far more secure than @entity8 ever was			2
but all power erodes over time -- in democracies and autocracies alike			0
maybe @entity8 is a mirror reflecting @entity21 's long - or even its medium - term future			1
this has been a bad week for @entity5 , but it was probably a very good week for @entity21			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			0

@entity159 says @entity5 's bad week may be good for @entity21
he says for @entity3 leaders greatness lies in domination
and that is especially true for the nations that were part of its empire
but for @entity21 , that is expensive and *ultimately* can not work
