-- so we 're at a point in the campaign where health care reform is about to go on trial at the @entity7 , unemployment remains high and gas prices are skyrocketing			2
as for the @entity11 presidential wannabes , they 're arguing over , um , an @entity13 metaphor bungled by a @entity15 staffer			1
( " you can kind of shake it up and we start all over again , " @entity15 senior adviser @entity16 told @entity0 this week			1
) sure , the metaphor has a perfection all its own , given @entity15 's penchant for redrawing policy lines			1
it 's just low - hanging fruit , hard to pass up			2
but the picture of two " serious " presidential candidates wandering the trail with an old - school toy as a prop can lead to only one conclusion : this is getting silly			1
the intellectual arguments have been made			2
the differences have been debated			2
and the voters are speaking			2
sure , they 're conflicted : hard - line conservatives and evangelicals will never love @entity15			1
but @entity15 has what appears to be an insurmountable delegate lead			1
he will not sprint across the finish line , to be sure			0
he will crawl across it			0
but he will get there nonetheless			0
if this were another time , the establishment power brokers would step in with a vision			0
they would take the candidates aside , give them the big - picture analysis from 30,000 feet and say : " unite for the sake of the party			2
" then they would take to the airwaves and offer their full - throated endorsements , turning their attention to seeking the defeat of president @entity51			0
consider this : former @entity54 gov. @entity53 endorses @entity15 , but there 's no rally , huge photo op or choreographed endorsement tour			1
one prominent tea party group says , well , i suppose we can live with @entity15 if that 's what we have to do			1
and tea party favorite sen. @entity64 , @entity67 - @entity66 , stops short of endorsing @entity15 but grudgingly allows that " i think we all need to look at this presidential primary and encourage the candidates to do a little self - reflection here -- what 's good for our country			1
" the moves toward @entity15 have all of the enthusiasm and passion of an arranged marriage			1
so what can be done ? answer : not much			0
the next moves are up to the candidates			2
first of all , the old - time power brokers do n't have much to offer anymore			0
the political power within the @entity11 has moved away from any organized structure toward two force fields : the populist guy in the street and the rich guys who can write multimillion - dollar checks			1
the super @entity91 sugar daddies -- simply by virtue of their money -- are the reason the campaigns continue			2
what 's the incentive for @entity98 to get out as long as @entity99 , from his perch in @entity101 , is willing to keep paying for his political ads ? the same goes for @entity104 , @entity105 's man , who gets to dabble in politics from his mountain views in @entity108 , @entity109			1
i bet these fellows have n't had this much fun in years			0
meantime , the newly populist @entity11 grass roots wo n't be told what to do anyway			1
party organizations ca n't deliver them anymore , and @entity15 is n't exactly the guy they were wishing for when the tea party came on the scene in 2010			1
the establishment is in disrepute as far as they 're concerned ; those are the people who bungled the economy			0
" people feel they can make this decision on their own , " @entity125 @entity11 rep. @entity11 , who has n't yet endorsed , tells me			1
" there 's just a lot less party loyalty			0
... we are in a period where people are searching			0
" at some point , though , the search has to end			0
the money men could get tired of writing checks for fewer and fewer delegates			0
the math may become overpowering			0
at some point , the voters will get restless			0
yet the final decisions will have to come from the men running			0
granted , @entity145 and @entity105 do n't like @entity15 much -- and the longer they run against him , the less they like him			1
and often with good reason			0
but here 's the final consideration : " you do n't want the blame for losing , " @entity11 says			1
" it 's one thing to fight the good fight			0
... but look at @entity15 in 2008			1
he knew when to get out			2
@entity15 knew how to end it the right way in 2008			1
after @entity158 , he saw the handwriting on the wall and embraced @entity161			1
and there 's a lesson in that : parties reward the winners , sure			0
but voters like good losers , too			0
knowing how to lose is the hardest part of running			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			2

@entity173 : @entity11 candidates are wandering campaign trail with @entity13 toys
she says neither @entity145 nor @entity105 can win , so why continue ?
in 2008 , @entity15 knew to get out after " he saw the handwriting on the wall , " she says
@entity173 : @entity105 , @entity145 can *prolong* the race , but would they be blamed for a @entity11 loss ?
