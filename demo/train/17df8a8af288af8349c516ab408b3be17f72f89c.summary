-- president @entity1 asserted during monday 's presidential debate that it cost the @entity4 less to help oust @entity6 dictator @entity5 than it did to run two weeks of the 2003 - 2011 war in @entity8 @entity1 , debating former @entity10 gov. @entity9 at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , made the comment while touting his decision to involve the @entity4 in a @entity17 no - fly - zone operation that helped rebels overthrow @entity5 over seven months in 2011			1
the statement : @entity1 : " keep in mind that i , and @entity4 , took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to -- without putting troops on the ground , at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in @entity8 -- liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years			1
fact check : @entity9 , @entity1 and @entity8 the facts : we can attempt a comparison by examining the @entity36 's spending on the two operations			1
the war in @entity8 cost the @entity36 tens of billions of dollars a year , reaching a peak in fiscal 2008 , when the department 's @entity8 obligations reached a monthly average of $ 11.1 billion , according to the @entity43			1
that year covered a good portion of the 2007 - 2008 @entity4 troop surge			0
@entity1 mentioned the cost at the two - week level			0
in fiscal 2004 -- the first full fiscal year of the war -- the department 's @entity8 obligations averaged $ 2.21 billion every two weeks , according to the @entity43			1
that average rose every year through fiscal 2008 , when the average two - week obligation was $ 5.12 billion			1
those are obligations -- basically the amount needed to be paid , and not the actual amount paid to date			0
we give you the obligations because the @entity43 says the @entity36 did n't track actual outlays until fiscal 2009			2
but , the @entity43 's report says that " average obligations for a fiscal year are a good indicator of ongoing operational costs			2
" by fiscal 2011 , which ended shortly before all @entity4 troops were out of the country , the @entity36 's spending had fallen to an average of $ 2.8 billion every two weeks , according to data from the @entity43			1
fact check : is @entity74 's core decimated or growing ? the rate of @entity4 military spending on the 2011 operation in @entity6 was significantly less			1
the multi-country operation to enforce a no - fly zone over @entity6 began on march 19 , 2011 , with @entity4 aircraft and ships helping to disable @entity6 's air defense network and airfields			1
the most expensive phase in @entity6 for the @entity36 appears to have been in march			0
the cost of initial operations through march 28 , 2011 , was estimated at $ 550 million , according to the @entity43			2
by april , @entity6 's air defenses were rendered pretty much useless , so the daily expense of the operation declined precipitously			0
@entity17 took over the operation in april and maintained leadership through the day of @entity5 's death in october 2011			0
the @entity36 said its cost from april 1 through september 30 was about $ 1.1 billion			2
that included daily military operations , munitions , the drawdown of supplies and humanitarian assistance			0
adding the two figures , you get about $ 1.65 billion			0
vice president @entity102 told @entity0 in october 2011 that the operation " cost us $ 2 billion			2
" it 's not clear whether he was referring to only @entity36 expenditures			0
conclusion : comparing only @entity36 expenditures , two weeks of military operations in @entity8 generally appear to have been more expensive than the @entity4 military role in the seven - month @entity6 operation			1
