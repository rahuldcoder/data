@entity13 spokesman @entity19 told @entity2 that the competition has been running annually since 1992			2
" we started very small			2
there were just a few clubs from around the world			2
but we have gone from strength to strength			0
last year the tournament was in @entity1 and sanctioned by the @entity28			1
" @entity19 said there are no professional players involved , but the standard of play is strong and the teams in the top divisions are very competitive			1
although the tournament involves club sides -- rather than national teams , there is still a strong international feel with players from the @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , and @entity51 all taking part			1

but it 's also about providing an environment where people can be free to be who they are			0
" it 's a lot about camaraderie too			0
there are a lot of places in the world where gays and lesbians are n't accepted			0

" it 's very open , we do n't discriminate			0
" he said gay , lesbian , bi-sexual and heterosexual players were all welcome to play			1
@entity19 said he is happy with how the 2009 event is unfolding , despite numbers being slightly down on what was expected -- due to the effects of the recession , swine flu and the upcoming @entity94 in @entity46 which has made attending the football tournament unaffordable for some teams			1
" this year we did n't have as big a global turnout as we hoped for but there have been a lot of challenges -- so we 're pleased to have 26 teams here			2
