-- @entity2 is so often described as the greatest dance actress of her generation , it might possibly be true			1
@entity8 with @entity10 's prestigious @entity9 for over a decade , the @entity6 's presence on a cast list is guaranteed to fill any theater in @entity10 , @entity12 or @entity13			1
her graceful adagio combinations and perfectly formed arabesques may have wowed audiences across the globe , but how would the 37 - year - old fare when parachuted into a dance culture she 'd never encountered ? this was the challenge for @entity2 's " @entity23			1
" over the course of 10 days , the classically trained ballerina traveled from @entity10 to @entity26 to immerse herself in the traditions of @entity29 dance and create a brand - new piece inspired by this meeting of east and west			1
guided on her trip by a local rising star of @entity29 contemporary dance , 34 - year - old choreographer @entity33 , @entity2 said the experience will change how she thinks about performance forever			1
in her own words , this is the story of her journey			2
@entity2 : ballet affects everything i do			1
on a physical level it impacts what i eat and drink , how much i sleep , when i go out			0
but it also affects how i see the world			0
when i read a book , watch television , go to the theater , i think to myself : " how can i assimilate that into my art form ? how would that be translated on the stage into a ballet ? " this is one of the reasons why the thought of traveling to @entity26 was so exciting for me			1
classic ballet is based on very particular notions of beauty , much of which is derived from the @entity66 concept of harmony : nothing too much or too little , all in perfect proportion , everything in a good relation to everything else			2
see also : see @entity26 's hidden culture , before the bulldozers get there but of course , other art forms and cultures have quite different notions of beauty			1
the first thing i noticed about the @entity29 ballet is that it is much more influenced by philosophy than physicality -- there was a lot more emphasis on meaning			2
these ideas are typically expressed with little gestures of the hand or head			0
such movements might not be the most beautiful to my eye , but because they have a shared cultural meaning -- a meaning that is understood by onlookers because it is part of their tradition -- it 's beautiful to them			0
one of the main challenges i experienced out there was trying to understand this complicated and subtle language			0
while i could always admire @entity29 and @entity107 dance from a distance , i felt that i could never really understand the depth of meaning -- and everything that comes with it -- until immersing myself in the culture first hand			1
i discovered that @entity29 ballet is a relatively young art form			2
it was introduced by madam @entity116 during the @entity117 ( 1966 - 76 ) and , until recently , it was used as a form of propaganda for the communist regime -- with communist heroines being saved by communist heroes and so on			0
but that part of history is viewed with mistrust by the younger generation , so at the moment ballet is going through a sort of reinvention			0
what 's really surprising is that the youth of @entity29 are now obsessed with incorporating traditions from before the revolution			2
unfortunately , a lot of that has been lost , and when they ca n't find what they 're looking for , they invent it			0
so what they call classical @entity29 dance is really only 10 or 20 years old and has bits of traditional ballet , a little bit of @entity146 , a bit of contemporary dance , a bit of everything			1
after a mere two days immersed in @entity29 culture , @entity33 and i combined our influences from east and west to create something new : a fusion of dancing cultures			1
see also : keeping the world 's greatest dancers on their toes the piece was choreographed by @entity33			0
he wanted to create something about a philosopher who had a dream and when he woke up he was n't sure what reality was anymore			0
and then i remembered a very famous @entity169 play by @entity170 called " @entity173 " which means " life is a dream			0
" and it was funny that exactly the same saying exists in @entity29 , in @entity169 and in @entity176 , so we thought that it was the perfect fusion , the perfect combination of cultures for the title			1
while the choreography was made by @entity33 , the interpretation was made by me			0
imagine a performance of @entity184 by a @entity29 theater company ; the actors would interpret the text through their traditions and what they know acting is supposed to be , but those words are still , of course , intrinsically @entity193			2
so , in a sense , it would n't be @entity176 and it would n't be @entity29			2
my performance of " @entity173 " is just the same			0
i was doing steps created by a @entity29 contemporary choreographer and i am a classically trained @entity199 dancer , so my interpretation is where the fusion occurred			1
i 'm not going to pretend that in one week i understand all the depth of @entity29 culture or that i can really move my hands like a traditional @entity29 dancer -- that would be @entity208 ve and arrogant of me			1
however , i found that the need for human beings to understand the world through art and story telling is universal ; we just have different vocabularies			0
i like to think that , in the future , my own performances will be enriched by new ways of communicating .			0
