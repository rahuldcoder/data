-- a backpack bomb discovered last week along a martin luther king jr. day parade route in @entity4 , @entity5 , contained a chemical found in rat poison and was packed with little metal pellets , apparently as shrapnel , a law enforcement official said thursday			1
the device was set up to be detonated remotely , the official told @entity0			2
the bomb is being examined in the @entity14 lab in @entity15 , @entity16			1
authorities do n't have a suspect and do n't know whether the bomb was linked to a white supremacist group , the official said			1
before the @entity24 march kicked off last week , three parade workers found the gray backpack on a bench at the northeast corner of @entity28 and @entity29 in downtown @entity4			1
no threat was made before the device was found , and no note was found with the backpack , authorities said			1
the @entity14 said last week it will consider regional neo-nazi activity in its investigation of the backpack bomb			1
two t - shirts were found in the @entity41 - brand backpack , authorities said			1
one shirt says " @entity43 2009 " and the other reads " @entity45 june 25th - 26th 2010			0
" @entity46 , special agent in charge of the @entity14 's @entity4 field office , said last week that authorities know of no link to " any specific group or individuals " and called reports linking the bomb to recent @entity56 activity in a nearby @entity58 town " premature			1
" the bureau is looking into the incident as " an act of domestic terrorism , " and investigators are analyzing " every square millimeter " of the backpack , @entity46 said			2
@entity66 , one of the founders of the @entity68 on @entity69 in nearby @entity70 , @entity58 , told @entity0 last week that he found the timing of the planted bomb and two recent @entity56 activities in @entity70 " just too overwhelming " and suggested hatred was also behind the @entity4 bomb			2
@entity70 is 35 miles east of @entity4			0
but @entity66 had no evidence tying the @entity4 bomb to the two activities in @entity78			2
earlier this month , a handful of neo-nazis protested two @entity82 restaurants with signs saying , " this is white land " and " we want you out of here , " he said			0
then , during the evening of the @entity24 holiday , about 15 neo-nazis demonstrated outside the @entity89 in downtown @entity70 , @entity66 said			0
about the @entity4 bomb discovery , @entity66 said : " it 's clear that it was an attempt to end the march and attack human rights advocates			2
" all three events were going on when there was a reaction by the white supremacists or hate groups in some way , " specifically at the two @entity70 events , @entity66 said			0
" we do n't know who did it , but there was certainly a reaction to human right events			0
" the @entity70 area had been a hotbed of neo-nazi activity through the @entity111 and @entity112 hate groups since at least the 1970s , though the groups were disbanded through criminal convictions and civil lawsuits by 2000 , @entity66 said			1
several bombings in @entity70 in the 1980s , including at the home of a @entity120 pastor and priest who was also serving as president of the human relations task force , were blamed on the @entity112 , @entity66 said			0
the priest was n't injured in that bombing , he said			0
a $ 20,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible			0
the @entity14 is asking the public for information on who might have been seen with the backpack from about 8 a.m. to 9:25 a.m. on the @entity24 holiday , january 17			1
it also is asking for photos or videos taken in the area			0
@entity0 's @entity139 and @entity140 contributed to this report .			0

the backpack bomb also contained metal pellets , the official says
the @entity14 says it has no evidence linking regional neo-nazi activity to the backpack bomb
