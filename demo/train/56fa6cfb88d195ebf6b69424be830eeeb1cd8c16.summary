@entity0 , @entity1 -- even though rising floodwaters were wreaking havoc along @entity1 's @entity8 communities on september 12 , @entity3 and his roommate , @entity4 , felt safe in their upscale home high on a hillside adjacent to @entity11			1
a mile downhill , downtown @entity0 's streets were underwater			0
" we thought there might be some minor flooding in the house , " said @entity3			1
" we 're so high up , we thought there would be nothing to worry about up here			0
" the drama was just beginning			0
in the early morning , @entity4 heard reports that heavy rain was isolating the city of @entity23 , where his sister @entity24 lives			1
he decided to evacuate @entity24 ; her partner , @entity30 ; their 8 - month old daughter , @entity29 ; and two family dogs			1
using @entity32 maps and a familiarity that came from riding mountain bikes in the area , @entity4 told @entity24 , who was reachable only via e-mail , that if she could hike over a ridge behind her home , they could meet at a rock quarry			1
flood death toll rises to seven " i zigzagged farm roads and dirt roads and found my way to the quarry , where i waited for them , quite anxiously of course			0
they eventually found one another , and the four , along with the dogs , crossed overflowing drainage channels and steep terrain to reach @entity4 's truck			1
a soggy , cold but happy @entity4 drove his extended family back to @entity0			1
but not all was well			0
after the rescue , @entity4 and @entity3 worried that their own home was in danger			1
@entity3 had to strip down and dive into neck - deep water to unblock a drain filled with mud and debris			1
@entity4 went outside to assess rising water			1
" the drainage is getting higher , " he said			0
within minutes , their backyard filled with floodwater			0
" there was a 4 - foot wall of water with branches and debris in it , " said @entity4			1
he ran inside and warned @entity24 , @entity30 , @entity3 and his girlfriend , @entity75 , to get out			1
" the latch on the door was creaking , " @entity4 said			1
" everything was about to give , and i knew we were going to get just hurt badly if we stayed any longer			0
" " it happened so quickly and suddenly , " @entity3 said			1
" it went from a very calm , warm and welcoming living room to a disaster in an instant			0
there was roaring and screaming and the sound of an immense amount of moving water and debris			2
" both roommates tried to hold back the @entity92 doors			0
" the force was overwhelming , and in the back of your head , you 're thinking of another slide could be coming down -- something that could be larger , " said @entity3			1
" we just decided in that instant , just to get out , " he said			0
after the initial rush of water , @entity4 and @entity3 went back to collect a few treasured items			1
@entity104 used her phone to shoot video of the flood			2
" i felt a little guilty , " said @entity4			2
" one minute i 'm on the highest of highs , feeling like i helped take care of my family -- the people closest to me -- and brought them to what seemed like a safe , warm place where at least we could be together			2
and then , moments later , i 'm walking around the hillside in the rain , with a towel on a baby , barefoot			2
" two other roommates were out of town during the landslide			0
they all returned to thick mud and ruined furniture			1
last saturday evening , after a grueling day salvaging belongings , an exhausted @entity125 sat down to the home 's @entity128 grand piano to play " @entity133 , " the ' 80s song by the @entity132 band @entity131			1
roommate @entity134 took out her phone and recorded @entity125 ' poignant rendition			2
" it was a beautiful moment in the midst of destruction , " @entity134 said			0
the video has gone viral			2
" it 's whimsical , it 's beautiful , it 's sad , and it touches you in a lot of ways , " said @entity3			2
" i think it explains this whole event			0
this is nature , and nature is beautiful in a lot of ways			0
it 's also incredibly destructive			0
it 's sad , and people are suffering right now			0
" he has been playing on and off for about 10 to 15 years and says he 's never been classically trained			0
@entity3 , an attorney , is modest in the limelight			2
he wants everyone to know that people are suffering in @entity1 , his home state , and he wants them to volunteer their time or give money to a charity like the @entity163			1
" our suffering is very small compared to others in the flood " , he said			0
the music " put a personal face on the flood in a way that flood coverage does n't , and i think that 's why it 's resonated			0

a @entity1 *man* and his roommate feel safe from flooding in their hillside home
