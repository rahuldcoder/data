for the third straight year , @entity0 has ranked fifth in the world for number of international conferences hosted			1
its airport is the busiest in @entity6			2
hotels are bursting to capacity			2
an increasing number of business travelers is arriving each month to @entity13 's capital , many not knowing what to expect			1
despite the cutting - edge technology the city is known for these days , there remain challenges for a first - timer in @entity0			1
traveling from the airport / around the city takes lots of time @entity0 is vast -- far greater than many expect			1
as the largest proper city in the developed world , it 's approximately 10 times the size of @entity30 , and much more crowded			2
what this means for the time - sensitive business traveler is that a lot of buffer time should be factored in -- about 30 minutes , to be safe -- for getting to and from meetings , especially if they involve crossing the @entity38			1
from @entity39 , the express train ( ₩ 8,000 or $ 7 ) runs every 30 minutes and will drop you off at @entity42 , north of the river , near the @entity45 business hub			1
not a lot of travelers seem to know about this for some reason , and trains are usually quite empty			1
@entity39 limousine buses ( ₩ 10,000 - ₩ 15,000 or $ 9 - $ 14 ) are another convenient way to get to most any destination from the airport			2
staffers at the airport 's bus counter are helpful if you tell them where you need to go			0
cabs cost around ₩ 50,000 or $ 48 to get into the heart of @entity61 ( south of the river ) or @entity63 ( north of the river )			0
during morning and evening rush hours , it 's best to take the train			0
the language barrier can throw you the language barrier is particularly frustrating when it comes to addresses and directions			1
unlike the @entity74 ( or most other countries ) , @entity13 historically numbered buildings based on the date they were built in each district , not by location			0
this means buildings next to each other can have completely different address numbers			0
( an initiative to change addresses is ongoing			1
) the best way to get around is to have the address written or printed out in @entity89 to show to taxi drivers who can then input the address in their gps system			0
stay strong while they grumble , and insist they put it in			0
when completely lost , call +82 2 120 , the city 's help center , which has various language assistance options including @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			0
hotel bookings should be based on location due to transit times ( up to 90 minutes to two hours to cross the city during rush hour ) it 's best to choose your hotel based on your meeting locations			0
best hotels , by business hub : @entity113 : @entity0 , @entity114 , @entity115 @entity45 : @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity119 ambassador @entity45 , @entity120 @entity121 ( near @entity123 convention center ) : @entity124 , @entity123 , @entity125 , @entity128 premier @entity126 best hotels if you 're flexible with location : @entity61 ( south of river ) : @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 @entity63 ( north of river ) : the @entity138 , @entity125 , @entity139 , @entity140 4			1
as in , a whole box in @entity13 , the standard business - related introduction involves reverently receiving and returning a business card , bowing and shaking hands , somehow all at the same time			1
when the exchange is done over a meal , it 's common to lay out the business cards of everyone at the table on the table in front of you so that you can remember everyone 's name and position as you talk to them			1
" that 's one of the things that people wish they had known before coming here -- how quickly they 're going to run out of business cards , " says @entity162 vice president @entity161			1
wear nice socks at all times it 's not just a matter of style -- it 's protection against embarrassment			0
many traditional @entity89 and @entity100 restaurants ( popular for business lunches and dinners ) require patrons to leave shoes at the door			1
few local humiliations match having a toe sticking out of an old , dirty sock in the midst of serious business talk			2
be prepared to drink and bow " showing you can drink a lot , hold your alcohol , and still talk intelligently about a subject is important to showing that you are a mature , working business person that 's worthy of trust , " says @entity185 , an investment banker from @entity186 who travels to @entity0 once a month for work			1
" pay attention and you 'll catch on quickly about the ritualism in business drinking			2
also , there 's a lot of only - @entity200 - allowed entertaining that happens afterward			0
" it 's considered rude to let someone pour his or her own drink			2
after toasting , it 's considered polite for younger people at the table to turn their heads to the side when they drink			2

layovers or delays = shopping @entity39 has been voted best airport in the world many times ... for good reason			0
apart from the shiny interior and quirky venues such as an ice skating rink , driving range and movie theater , the intense face - off between its two main duty free retailers , @entity225 and @entity138 , means big discounts for shoppers			0
( our recommended souvenirs include @entity89 cosmetics -- for women and men			0
) @entity238 's series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile			0
however @entity238 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0

business travelers should factor in plenty of buffer time for getting to meetings in @entity0
