@entity0 -- a @entity0 state lawmaker said monday he 's sorry if he offended anyone by dressing in blackface for a @entity6 party , but a colleague says his apology does n't go far enough			1
assemblyman @entity9 wore an @entity11 wig , an orange jersey and had his face painted brown by a professional makeup artist for a weekend party celebrating the @entity18 holiday at his home			1
he told the @entity20 that he was supposed to be " a black basketball player			0
" the @entity23 @entity22 initially tried to dismiss complaints about his costume as " political correctness to the absurd , " but reversed himself by monday afternoon in the face of mounting criticism			1
" anyone who was offended , i am sorry that they were offended , " @entity9 told reporters at a news conference			1
" that was not the intention , and that is really all i can say			2
i just have to reiterate it was @entity6			1
@entity6 is when people get dressed up			1
" but @entity9 's fellow @entity23 @entity22 , assemblyman @entity38 , said the costume was " callous and repugnant			1
" " i do n't think what he has said so far is sufficient , " @entity38 told @entity1			0
" it is a beginning , but we need to have a dialogue with him			2
" he said the use of blackface " brings back the memories of african - americans being reduced to buffoonery just to gain access to the entertainment industry			2
" and @entity52 , deputy national director of the @entity53 , told @entity1 that @entity59 " did n't take into account the history and context of what this is all about			0
" " that is the most disturbing part -- what he failed to think , " @entity52 said			0

during @entity66 , designer @entity65 was photographed in a dress that @entity9 said made @entity65 look like " one of the @entity70 people i represent			1
" @entity65 was convicted of making anti-semitic comments in a @entity73 cafe in 2011 , a crime under @entity76 law			0
" there are many @entity70 groups			0
not all of them dress in an identical fashion , but there was no doubt in my mind when i looked at the entire picture of what @entity65 was wearing that he looked like one of the @entity70 people that i represent , " @entity9 had told @entity1			2
" in light of his past , it was shocking			0
" @entity52 said that given those comments , @entity59 should have been more aware of how his costume would be perceived			0
" part about standing up for one group is to be more sensitive about other groups , especially as a public official , " he said			0
@entity1 's @entity97 contributed to this report .			0
