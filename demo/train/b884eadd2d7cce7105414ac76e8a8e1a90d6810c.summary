@entity1 guru @entity0 is out of prison , but the families of three acolytes who died in a sweat lodge ceremony vow to keep on eye on him if he tries to rebuild his self - help empire			1
@entity0 left an @entity10 prison friday after serving 20 months for the negligent homicides of three followers who sought spiritual breakthroughs but died of overheating in a sweat lodge near @entity15 in october 2009			1
@entity0 was driven friday afternoon from a minimum - security prison in @entity17 , said @entity10 corrections spokesman @entity18			1
he did not stop to talk with the media and others at the prison gate , @entity18 added			2
neither @entity0 nor his representatives could be reached for comment , but he will remain in @entity10 for the next 90 days , @entity18 said			1
the 55 - year - old son of an @entity26 preacher , @entity0 built a multimillion - dollar business as a best - selling author and motivational coach			1
his book , " @entity31 : @entity33 of attracting the life you want , " made him a @entity1 star			2
he was was riding high as he planned his october 2009 spiritual warrior weekend at the 70 - acre @entity38 retreat outside @entity15			2
according to testimony at his trial , acolytes who flocked to @entity38 's red rock foothills were willing to shave their heads , meditate in the desert for 36 hours without food and water and then symbolically die and be reborn in the sweat lodge ritual			1
fifty - five people followed @entity0 into the sweat lodge ; three died from overheating and 19 others were hospitalized after they collapsed , vomited , had trouble breathing , hallucinated , foamed at the mouth or fell unconscious			1
@entity0 was convicted of negligently causing the deaths of @entity54 , 38 , of @entity55 , @entity56 ; @entity57 , 49 , of @entity58 , @entity59 ; and @entity60 , 40 , of @entity61			1
@entity0 was found negligent , but acquitted of manslaughter charges that could have sent him to prison for 30 years			1
relatives of @entity54 , @entity57 and @entity60 vow to keep an eye on @entity0 should he attempt to rebuild the self - help empire that included best - selling books , motivational seminars , speaking engagements and $ 10,000 - a - head weekend retreats			2
they planned to confront @entity0 as he left prison and ask him to sign a " promise " to adhere to certain ethical practices			1
it was not immediately known whether they were able to do so or whether he signed			0
the promise also was sent this week to 160 other self - help practitioners -- including well - known personalities such as @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and dr. @entity86			0
the promise was issued by a new foundation founded in the memory @entity54 , an avid skier , surfer and free spirit who had a large circle of friends			0
her parents , @entity96 and @entity97 , attended @entity0 's trial and founded @entity99 , an organization that educates consumers about the unregulated self - help industry			1
members of @entity57 's and @entity60 's families also are active in the organization , the @entity102 said			2
@entity0 's sweat lodge exercise was based on a @entity108 purification ritual " as old as time itself , " as @entity0 told participants in a recorded pep talk before the ceremony			1
built of willow sticks and tarps , the lodge was 5 feet high and 23 feet across , with a pit in the middle			0
it was pitch - black inside , and people huddled together shoulder to shoulder			0
stones heated to an orange glow -- one for each participant , 55 in all -- were added to the pit at each 15 - minute round			0
@entity0 said the stones were symbolic of earthly ancestors and called them " grandfathers			2
" participants believed the ritual would lead them to powerful spiritual breakthroughs			0
but things started going wrong after a couple of hours			0
according to participants who testified during the trial , @entity0 ignored pleas for help , turning up the heat even as participants keeled over and were dragged from the tent			2
@entity57 quietly hunkered down until she slipped into unconsciousness , according to testimony			0
@entity54 drew her knees to her chest and rocked back and forth , chanting , " we can do it			0
" @entity60 carried one sickened woman out before collapsing next to @entity54			0
@entity0 acknowledged at his sentencing that he was responsible for the deaths , but offered no excuses for his lack of action as the chaos unfolded			1
he and his attorneys maintained that he was n't aware people were dying or in distress , or he would have stopped the ceremony			0
his defense centered on the possibility that toxins in the tarps contributed to the deaths			0
the @entity102 took the occasion of @entity0 's release from prison to draw attention to their organization , holding a news conference in @entity167			1
but their focus really is n't on @entity0			2
they want to honor their daughter 's memory by informing others			0
" i really do n't want to spend much time watching him , " @entity97 said over the telephone			0
" but i feel angry that people knew he was dangerous and it was n't public information			0
" she feels her daughter died needlessly , and that 20 months behind bars was n't enough to bring about a change of heart from a man who , according to testimony at his trial , walked out of the sweat lodge where people were suffering and dying , went to his room and took a shower .			1
