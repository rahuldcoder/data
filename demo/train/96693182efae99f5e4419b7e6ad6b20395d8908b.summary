@entity0 can not be born in @entity1			1
and there 's no place for @entity4 or a @entity5 either			1
in @entity1 , parents have to run by the government any name they want to bestow on their baby			1
and each year , there 's a bevy of unusual ones too bizarre to pass the taste test			0
the country 's @entity14 shared that growing list with @entity17 on wednesday			2
four words : what were they thinking ? in the past 12 years , the agency had to turn down not one , not two , but six sets of parents who wanted to name their child " @entity0			0
" also shot down were parents who wanted to grace their child with the name " @entity5			1
" @entity4 , " too , was rejected			0
specific rules as the agency put it , acceptable names must not cause offense to a reasonable person , not be unreasonably long and should not resemble an official title and rank			1
it 's no surprise then that the names nixed most often since 2001 are " justice " ( 62 times ) and " @entity40 " ( 31 times )			2
some of the other entries scored points in the creativity department -- but clearly did n't take into account the lifetime of pain they 'd bring			0
" oh , come on ! then there were the parents who preferred brevity through punctuation			0
the ones who picked ' " * " ( the asterisk ) or ' "			0
slipping through still , some quirky names do make it through			0
in 2008 , the country made made international news when the naming agency allowed a set of twins to be named ' " @entity65 " and " @entity64 " -- a popular cigarette brand -- and ok 'd the names " @entity68 " and " @entity69			1
" asked about those examples , @entity70 of the @entity71 ( under which the agency falls ) said , " all names registered with the @entity71 since 1995 have conformed to these rules			2
" and what happens when parents do n't conform ? four years ago , a 9 - year - old girl was taken away from her parents by the state so that her name could be changed from " @entity83 does the @entity84 from @entity85			0
" not alone to be sure , @entity1 is not the only country to act as editor for some parent 's wacky ideas			1
@entity90 also has a naming law and has nixed attempts to name children " @entity94 , " " @entity95 , " and the oh - so - easy - to - pronounce " @entity96			1
" in 2009 , the @entity97 contemplated banning unusual names after a host of parents began naming their children after cars or fruit			2
in the @entity106 , however , naming fights have centered on adults			0
in 2008 , a judge allowed an @entity110 school bus driver to legally change his first name to " in @entity113 " and his last name to " @entity114			0
" but the same year , an appeals court in @entity116 ruled against a man -- named @entity118 -- who wanted to change his name to " f --- censorship ! " here is a list of some the names banned in @entity1 since 2001 -- and how many times they came up justice : 62 @entity40 : 31 princess : 28 prince : 27 royal : 25 @entity130 : 10 major : 9 bishop : 9 majesty : 7 j : 6 @entity0 : 6 using brackets around middle names : 4 @entity136 : 4 lady : 3 using back slash between names : 8 judge : 3 royale : 2 messiah : 2 t : 2 i : 2 queen : 2 ii : 2 sir : 2 iii : 2 jr : 2 e : 2 v : 2 @entity146 : 2 master : 2 constable : 1 queen @entity149 : 1 regal : 1 emperor : 1 @entity4 : 1 @entity152 : 1 3rd:1 @entity153 : 1 g : 1 @entity154 : 1 general : 1 saint : 1 lord : 1			1
