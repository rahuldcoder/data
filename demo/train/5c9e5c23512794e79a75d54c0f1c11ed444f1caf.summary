@entity0 , @entity1 -- if you have n't heard the audio clip of high school football coach @entity5 going off , you need to take two minutes out of your life to do so			1
dude is yelling and screaming and you can hear stuff being banged around , and i do n't believe any actor outside of maybe @entity13 could come close to re-enacting the level of passion that is wrapped around each curse word that comes flying out of this man 's mouth			2
it is ^ % $ ^ & ! ! unbelievable			0
but based on that clip -- and the fact @entity5 is smart enough to teach @entity26 precalculus -- if my son played football at @entity22 , i would be perfectly fine with him having @entity5 as his coach			1
unfortunately coach @entity5 resigned this week because , well , this audio clip exists			2
some of the players secretly recorded @entity5 's pregame speech , and one of them posted it on @entity33			1
the actions of the players make me more upset than @entity5 's rant			2
coach was ticked because they were n't playing together as a team			1
what kind of player leaks his coach 's speech to the press ? a selfish one , thus proving his point			2
while i 'm sure it was uncomfortable for some of the players to sit through , i did n't hear anything that was offensive			1
he cursed , he yelled			0
it 's football , not @entity53			2
if this is his only offense , the community should rally around the coach , encourage him to come back and tell the high school players to toughen up			1
they should not punish a man who has poured 25 years of his life into the community or someone who cares so much he talks about being a @entity64 with pride			2
obviously if he 's been a teacher at the school for this many years , he clearly understands the difference between the field and the classroom , otherwise he would have been fired for going the ^ % ^ % * off years ago			2
there is certainly language that i think is unacceptable under any circumstances , but i did n't hear any of that on the clip			0
he did n't use any slurs ; he did n't threaten a player 's safety ; he did n't call the players anything other than apathetic and selfish			1
in some ways , it was one of the most respectful undressings i 've ever heard			0
since the story broke , there 's been a @entity88 page established to show support			0
i 've also seen anonymous quotes from @entity22 players characterizing @entity5 as a " psycho " and noting that was n't his first rant			1
and i 'm sure it was n't , given they had lost four of five games and need to win friday to make the playoffs			0
but funny , i did n't see any quotes that denied @entity5 's assessment of the team 's playing or their commitment to hard work			1
it was as if the players knew they were n't playing up to their potential			1
they just did n't like the way the coach said it			1
and having been around sports my entire adult life , i can tell you a lot of athletes -- on every level -- do not like it when a coach points out their faults			1
there is a line , but @entity5 did n't cross it			0
there are some places in life where boo boos are met with a hug			0
the locker room is not one of them			0
near my home there is a gymnastics school , and plastered on the wall facing the highway it reads " every child is a champion			0
" each time i drive by , i just want to pull over , run inside and tell the kids the truth			0
" @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 ... these people are lying to you -- only one of you can be a champion			0
they do n't hand out three gold medals ... see you later			0
" we are so obsessed with shielding kids from disappointment and discomfort that they have no idea how to deal with life when they leave the nest			0
that 's not parenting , that 's crippling			0
@entity5 's speech may have been shocking , but it may also have been the best thing to have happened to a kid in that locker room because it placed him in a highly stressful , highly confrontational situation , and the kid learned he can handle it			0
i can hear parents now saying , " but this is just high school , " to which i say , yes it is , and @entity5 was trying to teach his players something			1
i hope they reinstate him as coach so he can finish the lesson			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			1

a high school football coach was secretly recorded *chewing* out his players for losing
@entity172 says the coach *resorted* to shouting and *obscenities*
the coach was trying to teach his team an *important* life lesson , @entity172 says
@entity172 : adults who *shelter* children from *reality* are n't doing them any *favors*
