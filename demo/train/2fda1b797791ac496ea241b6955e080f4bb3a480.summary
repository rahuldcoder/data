-- @entity1 , @entity3 's swift military intervention to roll back advances made by @entity6 elements who had hijacked a separatist movement in northern @entity9 , could be a turning point in the ex-colonialist 's relationship with @entity13			1
it is not , after all , every day that you hear a senior official of the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) refer to a former @entity19 colonial power in @entity13 as " a brotherly nation , " as @entity21 , the @entity17 's special representative in @entity23 , described @entity3 on 14 january , while hailing the @entity19 nation 's military strikes in @entity9			1
@entity3 's persistent meddling to bolster puppet regimes or unseat inconvenient ones was often the cause of much outrage among @entity32 leaders and intellectuals			1
but by robustly taking on the @entity35 forces that for many months now have imposed a regime of terror in northern @entity9 , @entity3 is doing exactly what @entity32 governments would like to have done			1
this is because the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) , @entity42 and @entity43 ( @entity43 ) are a far greater threat to many @entity32 states than they ever would be to @entity3 or @entity19			1
see also : what 's behind @entity9 instability ? moreover , the main underlying issues that led to this situation -- the separatist rebellion by @entity9 's @entity51 , under the banner of the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) , who seized the northern half of the country and declared it independent of @entity9 shortly after a most ill - timed military coup on 22 march 2012 -- is anathema to the @entity17 and the @entity60 ( @entity60 )			2
successful separatism by an ethnic minority , it is believed , would only encourage the emergence of more separatist movements in a continent where many of the countries were cobbled together from disparate groups by @entity19 not so long ago			0
but the foreign @entity69 who had been allies to the @entity51 at the start of their rebellion had effectively sidelined the @entity53 by july last year , and have since been exercising tomcatting powers over the peasants in the area , to whom the puritanical brand of @entity77 being promoted by the @entity69 is alien			0
@entity60 , which is dominated by @entity79 -- formerly @entity3 's chief hegemonic foe in @entity13 -- in august last year submitted a note verbale with a " strategic concept " to the @entity83 , detailing plans for an intervention force to defeat the @entity69 in @entity9 and reunify the country			1
@entity60 wanted the @entity83 to bankroll the operation , which would include the deployment a 3,245 - strong force -- to which @entity79 ( 694 ) , @entity90 ( 581 ) , @entity91 ( 541 ) and @entity92 ( 350 ) would be the biggest contributors -- at a cost of $ 410 million a year			0
the note stated that the objective of the @entity69 in northern @entity9 was to " create a safe haven " in that country from which to coordinate " continental terrorist networks , including @entity43 , @entity41 , @entity100 [ in @entity79 ] and @entity101 [ in @entity102 ]			2
" despite compelling evidence of the threat the @entity69 pose to international peace and security , the @entity83 has not been able to agree on funding what essentially would be a military offensive			0
@entity83 resolution 2085 , passed on 20 december last year , only agreed to a voluntary contribution and the setting up of a trust fund , and requested the secretary - general " develop and refine options within 30 days " in this regard			0
the deadline should be 20 january			0

if the @entity69 had been allowed to capture the very strategic town of @entity125 © , as they seemed intent on doing , they would have captured the only airstrip in @entity9 ( apart from the airport in @entity128 ) capable of handling heavy cargo planes , and they would have been poised to attack the more populated south of the country			2
those @entity32 who would be critical of the @entity3 are probably stunned to embarrassment : @entity13 's weakness has , once again , been exposed by the might of a foreign power			1
watch video : @entity3 troops welcomed in @entity9 africans , however , can perhaps take consolation in the fact that the current situation in @entity9 was partially created by the @entity143 action in @entity144 in 2010 , which @entity3 spearheaded			1
a large number of the well - armed @entity69 and @entity51 separatists had fought in the forces of former @entity144 leader @entity149 , and then left to join the @entity53 in northern @entity9 after @entity149 fell			2
they brought with them advanced weapons , including shoulder - launched anti-aircraft missiles from @entity144 ; and two new @entity6 terrorist groups active in northern @entity9 right now , @entity42 and @entity41 , were formed out of these forces			0
many @entity32 states had an ambivalent attitude towards @entity149 , but few rejoiced when he was ousted and killed in the most squalid condition			0
a number of @entity32 countries , @entity79 included , have started to deploy troops in @entity9 alongside the @entity3 , and @entity60 has stated the objective as the complete liberation of the north from the @entity69			1
the @entity69 are clearly not a pushover ; though they number between 2,000 and 3,000 they are battle - hardened and fanatically driven , and will likely hold on for some time to come			0
the question now is : what happens after , as is almost certain , @entity3 begins to wind down its forces , leaving the @entity32 troops in @entity9 ? @entity79 , which almost single - handedly funded previous @entity60 interventions ( in @entity170 and @entity171 in the 1990s , costing billions of dollars and hundreds of @entity79 troops ) , has been reluctant to fund such expensive missions since it became democratic			1
see also : @entity79 waiting for ' @entity174 ' its civilian regimes have to be more accountable to their citizens than the military regimes of the 1990s , and @entity79 has pressing domestic challenges			0
foreign military intervention is no longer popular in the country , though the links between the northern @entity69 and the destructive @entity100 could be used as a strategic justification for intervention in @entity9			2
the funding issue , however , will become more and more urgent in the coming weeks and months , and the @entity186 must find a sustainable solution beyond a call for voluntary contributions by member states			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			0
