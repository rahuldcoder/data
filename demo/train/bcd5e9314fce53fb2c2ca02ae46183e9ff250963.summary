-- a @entity2 advisory committee that has been weighing evidence on whether dye additives in food affect behavior in children will make its recommendation thursday			1
the panel will first listen to testimony from the public and the industry			1
it spent wednesday listening to testimony from doctors and scientists who contend that studies , although small in many cases , do show that some kids begin to show signs of hyperactivity once they are exposed to certain dye mixtures			1
the question is whether the @entity2 committee will urge the agency to strengthen its regulation of the ingredients ? although the committee only makes recommendations to the @entity2 , the agency usually follows those recommendations			1
according to the experts who testified , @entity33 companies already are dropping dyes including @entity35 # 1 , yellow # 5 , @entity37 # 3 and others and substituting natural dyes for them			1
but the @entity40 still allows artificial dyes , mostly for aesthetic reasons , not for taste			1
" why are these dyes in these foods anyway ? " asked @entity44 , executive director of the @entity45 and the @entity46 , a watchdog group on nutrition and food safety			2
" i would push for having them taken out completely			0
but if that ca n't be done , why not warn the public and parents that these dyes could have some effects ? " the idea that dyes in food causes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , or @entity61 , was first noted in " @entity62 , " a book written by dr. @entity64 in 1975			1
the eating style described in the book became known as the @entity67			0
he found if one eliminated artificial food dyes and additives in @entity40 diets , cases of hyperactivity in children would decline			1
but reviews of the data found that the correlation between dyes and hyperactivity were inconsistent			2
although numerous data have been collected on food dyes and hyperactivity in kids over the past decade , critics say the design of the studies has been weak			1
they note many of the studies were performed on small groups -- many involved no more than 25 children			2
they also noted that much of the observation data ( how the child acted ) was reported by parents and not by clinicians			0
and they pointed out that most of the dyes tested were combined into a dye mixture and not tested individually			0
the most recent studies to bring food dyes and adhd back to the public eye was a 2007 project conducted by researchers at the @entity104 in the @entity105			2
it showed that artificial food dyes along with sodium benzoate ( a white crystalline salt used as a food preservative ) increased adhd symptoms in both hyperactive and non-hyperactive children			0
that study was followed up by another paper in 2010 by the same researchers who looked at the connection between food dyes , adhd and histamine , a chemical that 's produced in the brain when the body is having an allergic reaction			2
" we found mixtures of certain artificial colors together with sodium benzoate preservative in the diet increased the average level of hyperactivity in 3 and 8/9 year old children in the general population , " dr. @entity130 , a professor at the @entity132 at the @entity104 , and lead author of the study , testified wednesday			0
" we found mixtures of certain artificial colors together with sodium benzoate preservative in the diet increased the average level of hyperactivity in 3 and 8/9 year old children in the general population			0
" yet , it was noted that when the @entity143 data were unveiled to the @entity144 , a @entity33 version of the @entity2 , the @entity141 found the evidence weak			1
but some groups in the @entity40 say the findings are another reason that dyes should go			1
a recent report issued by @entity152 looked at data from a number of studies related to artificial food dyes			2
@entity44 argued to the board wednesday that artificial food dyes are not safe for humans and can be connected to numerous health problems , including adhd allergies , even cancer " the average child consumes approximately 121 milligrams of artificial dyes a day , " @entity44 asserted			0
" that 's a lot			0
and dye in food is used twice as much as it was in the 1970s			0
these are noted scientific effects			0
there are other factors that could affect child behavior , but if we can take out food dyes as a factor , why not ? "			0

the @entity2 usually follows through with panel 's recommendation
testimony : some studies show some kids show signs of hyperactivity
testimony : @entity33 companies are dropping dyes
the @entity40 still allows them
