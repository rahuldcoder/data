-- @entity1 is n't your typical 23 - year - old			1
on january 8 , 2011 , @entity3 opened fire at a " @entity5 on your corner " event in @entity6 , @entity7 , featuring @entity9 rep. @entity8			1
since he had some medical training , @entity12 ran toward the gunfire to tend to victims , realized @entity8 was shot on the left side of her head and used his bare hands to keep her from losing more blood			1
six people died and 13 people were injured , including @entity8 , who is still recuperating			1
that was @entity12 's first week interning for @entity8			1
he 's been credited with saving @entity8 ' life and recognized as a hero , although he rejects the title			1
since the tragedy , @entity12 's life has n't been the same : it 's involved interviews , meeting the president and first lady , and national fame			1
after graduating from the @entity33 , he was elected to serve on a school board in @entity6 but also travels the country as an inspirational speaker			2
now , in a heartfelt memoir , " they call me a hero : a memoir of @entity45 , " the @entity6 native speaks in detail of the shooting , the experiences that have helped shaped him and why he does n't want to be called a hero			1
@entity12 spoke with @entity0 about the book and growing up gay and @entity49 in @entity7			1
an edited transcript of the conversation is below			2
@entity52 and @entity53 : the new ' @entity54 ' of gun control @entity0 : it 's clear in the book that you are n't comfortable with the word " hero " or the attention , so what challenges did you come across when writing this book ? @entity1 : you know , it 's not easy writing a memoir when you do n't like talking about yourself			1
( laughs ) that was something i had to overcome quickly			0
i was very fortunate in working with young - adult writer @entity70			0
but , when we were writing , she kept having to remind me , " i need you to tell me what it was like and how you felt , " because i was very matter - of - fact and straightforward			0
having to talk about my emotions and having to remember very sad and tragic memories was very tough for me			0
giving up my privacy to achieve writing what i thought was a good book was difficult , but i did n't want to write something and hold back , because that would 've defeated the purpose of writing a memoir			2
@entity0 : what inspired you to write this memoir ? @entity12 : i was first approached to do a memoir right after the shooting , but the pitch seemed opportunistic and contrived and not something i was willing to do , especially considering six people were just killed and 13 were injured			1
i did n't want it to seem like i was taking advantage of something so horrific			0
if it were up to me , i would not be writing a memoir at the age of 21			2
but the idea of public service and getting young people involved came up , and that interested me , because there are n't too many young gay @entity105 authors who are writing about their experiences			2
so that 's why i really chose to work on this project			0
@entity0 : whom did you write book for ? @entity12 : i 've traveled around the country and have met lgbt or @entity105 young people who think they are n't being taken seriously , who are doing amazing work on social issues , who would say to me , " we 're so excited that you 're here			1
we never see people like us working to make this world a better place			0
" i was writing to them			0
@entity3 sentenced to life for @entity7 shootings @entity0 : after the shooting , you were hesitant to do any interviews , but then a friend who helped you with the press said it was important " to show that a @entity49 man saved the day in a state that has been discriminatory toward @entity105			1
" was this what made you change your mind ? @entity12 : someone who is in my shoes who probably should 've never had the opportunity to intern for the congresswoman , because @entity144 are n't expected to do well academically			1
@entity145 made me realize that something positive had to come out of this horrific situation , especially someone who typically would n't be in this position			0
i still continue to do interviews because i think it 's important for people to see " this is the face of @entity7 , this is the face of @entity9 , " and it 's a different face from the one you are used to , but it 's one that 's in every community around this country			1
@entity0 : is it difficult to be @entity49 and gay in @entity7 ? @entity12 : it depends on where you are , sadly			1
for example , i do a lot of driving , and when i 'm in rural @entity7 , i 'll get pulled over a lot but not because i 'm speeding but because of what i look like			1
he 'll say , " you were reported as being suspicious , " and i 'll hand over @entity171 , but then his whole demeanor will change , and he 'll say , " are n't you the guy who helped @entity52 ? " it 's really striking that i went from being a " suspicious driver " to being the " hero " who helped @entity52			2
it 's one of the reasons that i 'm so vocal about staying in @entity7 and doing what i can do here			2
but if @entity144 are n't here to fix these problems , then it 's never going to be done			0
it 'll only get worse			0
the demographics will change soon ; the @entity105 population will soon be the majority , but we need institutions to facilitate that			0
i want to show that we 're here and we care just as much as you do about making @entity7 a better place to live for everyone			2
@entity0 : do you have a five - year plan ? @entity12 : i 'll probably go back to grad school at some point , learn as much as i can from people all over the country			2
whether it 's volunteering at the school board or writing a book , i 'm just making the best out of this horrific situation			0
hopefully inspiring some folks to get interested in their community that otherwise were n't involved			0
unfortunately , there is no grandiose five - year plan			0
there used to be , but things have changed because of what happened on january 8			0
i never thought that i 'd be in the position that i 'm in now			0
making peace with a monster			0
