after thousands of deaths and months of futile attempts to avoid more in @entity6 's fight with @entity8 rebels , leaders on both sides talked past each other wednesday , with one saying direct negotiations were off the table and another suggesting that the war be settled with a duel			1
@entity14 , leader of the self - declared separatist republic in eastern @entity6 's @entity16 , said he challenges @entity6 president @entity17 to a one - on - one fight to end the monthslong conflict			1
regardless of whether @entity14 's offer was sincere , it reflected a serious reality : a war that has spread misery in eastern @entity6 and heightened tensions between @entity26 and the @entity27 is still going on , despite a supposed ceasefire that the two sides signed two months ago			1
" let 's follow the example of the ancient @entity36 leaders and glorious @entity38 chiefs and clash in a fight , " @entity14 said , adding that @entity17 could pick the time and weapons , according to @entity32			2
" the one who wins will dictate the terms to the opposite side			0
" @entity6 's government made no immediate public response			2
but @entity45 did say that two @entity6 soldiers were killed and more than a dozen others were wounded in clashes across eastern @entity6 on tuesday			1
and @entity6 prime minister @entity49 said wednesday that @entity45 would not negotiate directly with the rebels , arguing that a ceasefire deal already had been made and all that anyone needed to do was follow it			1

from mid-april to september 16 alone , the conflict had killed at least 3,500 people and injured at least 8,100 others , according to the @entity77			0
the sides reached a ceasefire agreement in september , but fighting has returned to levels that preceded the ceasefire , a @entity84 security source who has detailed knowledge of the matter told @entity4 earlier this month			2
@entity6 and the @entity27 have accused @entity26 of supporting the rebels by sending @entity26 troops , weapons and supplies			1
