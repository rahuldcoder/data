-- when it was first invented , soda pop was a treat most people had once in a while for special occasions			0
now it 's a daily fixture in @entity8 life -- in bright containers glowing inside vending machines , chugged from 32 - ounce bucket - like containers at self - service stations and served as the default beverage in fast - food meals			1
in today 's carbonation nation , half of the @entity8 population over age 2 consumes sugary drinks daily , according to a report released by @entity22			1
the sugary drinks include sodas , sweetened waters , and energy , sports and fruit beverages			1
not included in the total were diet drinks , 100 % fruit juices , sweetened teas and flavored milk			2
the report states that sugary drinks have been linked to " poor diet quality , weight gain , obesity , and in adults , type 2 diabetes			1
" male teens are the most frequent consumers and guzzle about 252 to 273 calories every day from various drinks , the report says			1
their one - day consumption is more than half the weekly intake suggested by the @entity46 , which recommends no more than three 12 - ounce cans of soda in one week ( equivalent to 450 calories )			2
the consumption of such sugary drinks has increased over the last 30 years , the report stated			1
a 2003 study published in the journal of the @entity55 found that soda drinking for youths between the ages of 6 and 17 was at 37 % in the 1970s and then 56 % in the 1990s			0
this latest research from the @entity60 suggests that from 2005 to 2008 , consumption increased again			1
" if you look at male children , 70 % consume on a given day , " said lead author @entity62 , a @entity60 epidemiologist who specializes in obesity			1
the analysis was based on 17,000 participants who were asked to recall what they ate in the last 24 hours in the @entity69			0
the @entity70 denied that its products fueled obesity : " contrary to what may be implied ... sugar - sweetened beverages are not driving health issues like obesity and diabetes			1
" it pointed to market data indicating that the calories in beverages decreased by 21 % from 1998 to 2008 , while obesity rates climbed			2
it also stated that sugar - sweetened beverages account for 7 % of calories in the average @entity8 diet			1
" that means @entity8 get 93 percent of their calories from other foods and beverages , " the group stated			1
the latest @entity60 research released wednesday also found similar results : kids and teens get about 6.7 % to 8.2 % of their daily caloric intake from the beverages , and adults get about 5 % to 8 %			1
but the extra calories from drinks could add several pounds every year , said @entity98 , a nutritionist			2
" a lot of times , people do n't think of beverages as part of their daily total calories , " she said			2
" when i think about soda drinking -- in general , it provides empty calories			0
it takes the place of more nutritious options			0
" she suggested alternatives like water , sparkling water , tea and skim milk			0
the @entity60 's report found major differences in soda consumption depending on race , sex and income level			1
in every age category , males consumed more sugary drinks than females			1
this could be because males consume more calories than females , @entity62 said			0
in terms of race , black children got about 8.5 % of their total daily calories from sugary drinks , compared with 8.2 % for @entity136 and 7.7 % for white children			1
black adults received 8.6 % of their daily calories from sugary drinks , and the figure was 8.2 % for @entity136 and 5.3 % for whites			1
there was also a direct association between income level and sugary beverage consumption			2
adults living in a family of four earning approximately $ 29,000 per year got 8.8 % of their daily calories from sugary drinks , compared with 4.4 % for those who earned about $ 77,000			1
last year , @entity150 attempted to end subsidizing the purchase of sodas in the food stamps program , saying the benefits were used to fuel a serious public health problem			0
but this month , the @entity8 @entity156 rejected the city 's proposal , citing agency concerns that " the scale and scope " of banning soda would be " too large and complex			2
" the @entity163 has actively campaigned for soda reduction with a stomach - churning ad that likened drinking soda to chugging dollops of fat			0
the recent @entity60 report also found that while half of the population does n't drink sugary beverages , about 25 % consumes amounts of the drinks that total fewer than 200 calories per day			1
about 5 % drink about 567 calories on any given day , which amounts to more than four 12 - ounce cans of cola			0
sugary drinks became ingrained in @entity8 daily life because of effective ad campaigns , fast - food restaurants and increased serving sizes , said @entity185 , executive director of the @entity186			1
but the tides are turning , he said			0
the group announced a campaign wednesday called @entity191 's @entity190 to nationally organize civic associations , minority groups and religious communities to reduce soda consumption			0
" there 's pretty much a consensus among health officials that soft drinks are a major cause of obesity , " @entity185 said			2
@entity203 's government buildings have banned soda , several public school systems have kicked them out of their campuses , and the @entity208 has stopped selling the beverages in its hospitals			0
" there 's a real movement in that direction , and the soda industry recognizes this and is diversifying away from traditional carbonated drinks to bottled water and noncarbonated things like energy drinks and sports drinks , " @entity185 said			2
" the soft drink industry is very nervous and will diversify to maintain their profits			0
" while energy drinks and sports drinks may have fewer calories and less sugar , they enjoy health halos that are not warranted , he said			2
pediatricians : no energy drinks for kids ; greatly limit use of sports drinks dr. @entity234 , director of the @entity235 and @entity236 at @entity237 , said it 's easy to be misled by drink labels			0
" many times , they do n't know , " he said about his pediatric patients who guzzle sugar - sweetened beverages with labels touting vitamins and antioxidants			0
" the marketing is so skewed			0
' get your 100 % vitamin c , juice			0
' they do n't tell you how much sugar is there			0
look at the back , not the front of the package			0
