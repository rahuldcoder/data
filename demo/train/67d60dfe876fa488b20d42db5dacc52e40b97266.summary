-- @entity1 , from his comments to police to the arguments of his lawyers , has steadfastly maintained he should n't be found guilty of murder in the death of @entity8 , contending he shot the teen in self - defense			1
but jurors weighing his fate wo n't hear that from him directly			0
on wednesday afternoon , judge @entity14 asked @entity1 if he 'd made a decision about taking the stand in his own defense			1
" after consulting with counsel , " @entity1 replied , he 'd decided " not to testify , your honor			1
" moments later -- and after @entity21 refused a request from @entity1 's team to dismiss the case before the jury could weigh in -- the defense rested its case			1
that closed another chapter in a case that has transfixed much of the nation on issues such as race and gun violence and set the stage for closing arguments starting thursday and a jury decision as soon as friday			1
what exactly the jury will be deciding , though , is still in question			0
@entity1 , 29 , is accused of second - degree murder in the february 26 , 2012 , death of @entity8 , a 17 - year - old from @entity42 who was staying with his father in @entity45 , @entity46 , neighborhood			1
he was shot dead after an altercation with @entity1 that occurred as he was walking back from a nearby convenience store			1
prosecutors asked the court wednesday to let jurors consider two charges other than murder in relation to @entity8 's death : manslaughter and aggravated assault			1
@entity1 's lawyers objected , saying it should be murder or nothing			1
@entity21 , with @entity46 's 18th @entity61 responsible for overseeing cases out of @entity63 , is expected to decide that matter thursday			0
another point that will be addressed is whether @entity46 's controversial " @entity76 " law -- which gives a person facing a " presumption of fear of death or great bodily harm " extra protections should they respond with force instead of retreat -- can be applied by the jury			0
@entity1 has never denied shooting @entity8			1
but he 's contended that he had to do so to save his own life , portraying himself as the victim and @entity8 as the aggressor			0
but the late teen 's backers insisted the shooting could not be justified , with activists leading widely attended rallies and taking other steps urging authorities to press charges			0
faulting @entity1 for ignoring a 911 dispatcher 's direction not to follow the teen , they believe @entity1 profiled @entity8 because he was black			1
@entity1 trial : it 's about race many of those arguments , on both sides , will likely play out during closing arguments			2
those start thursday afternoon , when @entity99 makes the prosecution 's case for up to two hours			1
defense lawyer @entity102 will make his case , for up to three hours , on friday morning , followed by a rebuttal of up to one hour from prosecutor @entity105			1
then , later friday , the case will be in the hands of the all - female jury			2
lawyer wrestles with foam dummy the prosecution had once stated its intention to call up to three witnesses in the rebuttal phase of the trial			2
but for various reasons -- because the judge ruled they could n't pursue one line of questioning , amid uncertainty if one witness was unavailable and in the other case unexplained -- they did not			2
that means the last witness the jury will have heard from is @entity127 , @entity1 's father			2
he testified -- like his wife , @entity128 , had earlier in the trial -- that he believes it was his son who was screaming on the infamous 911 recording of the altercation that ended in @entity8 's death			0
contrast their testimony to that of @entity8 's mother , @entity138 , who said she was " absolutely " certain that the panicked voice was that of her son @entity140			0
the late teenager 's brother , @entity141 , made a similar declaration in court			0
defense attorneys argue @entity1 shot @entity8 in self - defense after the @entity42 teenager charged him			1
prosecutors argue @entity1 followed @entity8 through his neighborhood and shot him without provocation			2
besides @entity127 , others took the stand wednesday as well in the defense team 's fourth day presenting their case			2
they included a " use - of - force " expert and @entity156 , who spoke of being appreciative of her neighbor @entity1 's support after being the target of a home invasion			2
still , the day 's star may have been a foam dummy			0
@entity102 grappled with the life - size model inside the courtroom , working to show rapt jurors the competing versions of what happened the rainy night @entity8 was killed			1
assistant state attorney @entity105 brought out the dummy in an effort to demonstrate that it would have been difficult for @entity1 to retrieve his handgun from his pocket with @entity8 straddling him , as defense attorneys have argued was the case			1
the fatal gunshot , @entity105 reminded defense witness @entity176 , was fired at a 90 - degree angle into @entity8 's body			0
' raise your voice , not your hands , ' cops urge as @entity1 verdict looms " would n't that be consistent with @entity184 getting off of @entity1 and @entity1 raising the gun and firing it ? " @entity105 asked @entity176 , a use - of - force expert			2
" it could be consistent with any kind of movement ... we were n't there so the info that we have is @entity1 's statement , " he said			0
later , defense attorney @entity102 straddled the dummy himself , pounding the back of its head against the carpeted courtroom floor , demonstrating how he says @entity8 gave @entity1 the head wounds seen in police photographs from the night of the shooting			1
he later asked @entity176 -- a former police officer with extensive training in firearms and self - defense -- if it would have been possible for @entity1 to reach around @entity8 's body to get at a gun located near his hip			1
" yes , sir , " @entity176 replied , minutes before @entity21 called a lunch break			0
earlier , @entity176 testified the apparent fight between @entity1 and @entity8 went on for a relatively long time -- some 40 seconds -- and was clearly marked by a high level of fear and anxiety			0
" i have personally sat there and timed it myself , where it is about 40 seconds of time			0
that 's a very long time to be involved in any type of physical altercation , " @entity176 said			0
" we have a golden rule , " he told defense attorney @entity102			0
" if you have not successfully completed the fight , if you have not won the fight in 30 seconds , change tactics , because the tactics you are using are not working			0
" in trial , it 's a jury of millions @entity232 's @entity231 , @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 and @entity0 's @entity236 contributed to this report .			0

the defense rests their case after @entity1 declines to testify
this comes after rapt jurors watch attorneys *tussle* with a dummy in the courtroom
the judge will mull a request to include a manslaughter *option*
the prosecution will close on thursday ; the defense will do so friday
