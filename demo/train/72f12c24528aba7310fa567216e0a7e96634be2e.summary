-- millions of golf fans around the world were watching on television with great anticipation			0
the 18th - green gallery at @entity6 was packed as a remarkable sporting story was about to be concluded			2
all @entity8 could think about was getting his phone out and capturing the moment			1
" i looked around and thought , ' how nice is that , ' to see the big leaderboard and then see the screen which says ' @entity8 to retain the @entity15 , ' " he tells @entity0 's @entity12 show			1
" i would have loved to take out my @entity16 and take a picture of it			0
" the @entity19 stood over a seven - foot putt to win the @entity21 for @entity22 , which had stunned the @entity24 team by making up a four - point deficit on the final day			1
his opponent @entity26 had already missed his birdie putt to level their crucial singles match , and all the attention switched to @entity8			1
short of his best form for over a year and feeling he had let down a teammate in an earlier match , @entity8 could have been forgiven for having doubts			1
but despite his earlier difficulties , having lost his only other match in that @entity15 when paired with @entity39 in fourballs , @entity8 is adamant that thoughts of failure never entered his mind			1
" honestly i did n't think about missing , i did n't think about the importance of that putt -- i was just very , very happy to be in that position , " he recalls ahead of this week 's rematch at @entity47 in @entity48			2
" i mean some people they are scared of that moment and , obviously i can talk like this now because i made the putt , but i was not that nervous			2
" sure enough , @entity8 walked confidently forward and stroked home the putt with some aplomb before being mobbed by his teammates			1
@entity22 eventually won 14½ - 13½ to retain golf 's most prestigious team competition -- a comeback win that was soon dubbed the " @entity21			1
" for @entity8 it proved a turning point in a career that had seen him win a major and reach no. 1 in the world rankings before a slump in form sent him tumbling down the rankings			2
" it made a huge , huge difference for the future , because i know when it comes down to those crucial situations and when it comes down to making those putts , i have done it before , " he says			2
the improvement in form did not happen overnight and 2013 passed without a tournament victory , but having made the decision to campaign full - time on the @entity83 this year , it was only a matter of time			0
@entity8 's purple patch started with a superb victory at may 's @entity88 in @entity89 -- a tournament known unofficially as " the fifth major " -- and then a stunning eight - shot win at the @entity92 at @entity93 in june			1
the 29 - year - old was simply unstoppable as he broke @entity96 's halfway record for the tournament and kept on stretching his lead			1
it was his second major after 2011 's @entity100 triumph and confirmation of his talents			2
victory also sealed his place in the @entity22 team for september 's biennial @entity15 match against the @entity24 -- his fourth straight appearance having been a captain 's pick by @entity110 in the 2008 match at @entity112			1
@entity8 revealed to @entity0 that @entity113 , the @entity22 team 's skipper for the match at @entity47 in @entity48 , had told him prior to his @entity117 triumph at @entity118 that he was going to be in his lineup as a pick should he fail to qualify by right			1
" he said , ' you do n't need to make anything special , just play your game -- show what you can do			0
show to yourself and then you will make the team anyways			0
' and then obviously it turned out to be a great week for me			0
" with @entity96 claiming the @entity132 and @entity100 titles , two members of the @entity22 lineup will be have three of this year 's four majors between them , but @entity8 knows that the pressures of team golf are completely different			1
" you see the fans singing songs on the first tee , like at a football stadium , it is just brilliant and we do n't really have that usually -- only every two years , " he says			0
for @entity8 , a football fan who cheered @entity19 to " one of my proudest moments " as his national team claimed the @entity147 in @entity148 , this acts as extra motivation			2
" you ca n't wait to go out there and play with your partner , play for the whole team , play for your continent and obviously play for my country , " he says			0
" i played football when i was younger and i loved it			0
i loved that atmosphere , you know , when you play for each other , you fight for the same reason , for the same goal			0
" despite @entity22 appearing to have the advantage on current form , @entity8 will not be taking anything for granted when the action starts friday in @entity48			1
" i think it will be a battle again -- it was very , very tight the last couple of times			0
and that is what is so nice about it -- it 's not like one team shows up and has no chance against the other , " he says			0
" it 's great that you play for the pride -- it 's not about money , it 's not about world ranking points			0
it is fantastic to play			0
