@entity1 's murderous tactics have descended to a new barbaric low			1
last saturday , a bomb strapped to a schoolgirl exploded in the center of @entity7 in @entity8 , killing at least 20 people			2
then , on sunday , two girls simultaneously blew themselves up in a market in @entity12 in @entity13 , killing three and injuring more than 40			2
it is clear that girls as young as 10 ​ are being lined up as suicide bombers to further @entity1 's cause			1
and these new bombings come as @entity1 has also caused outrage around the world with its indiscriminate massacre of innocent men , women and children in the towns of @entity26 and @entity26			1
indeed , new photographs obtained by @entity28 show the devastation of more than 3 , ​ 700 homes , local shops , local churches and their local schools			2
@entity35 , it seems , is sacrosanct			2
@entity36 , @entity37 researcher for @entity28 , said this was the " largest and most destructive " @entity1 assault his organization has ever seen			1
the @entity37 government estimated 150 people were killed , but some widely reported private estimates put the figure as high as 2,000			2
days earlier , on january 4 , 40 boys and young men , ages 10 to 23 , were abducted from a village in the @entity37 state of @entity8			0
this willful destruction of even the most innocent of lives destroys any illusion that @entity1 will try to shield any civilian , however young or however frail , from its ​ attacks and killings			1
as a result , this year is poised to be a year of infamy that could exceed the horrors of the last one			0
in november , for example , at least 120 people were killed in a bomb attack on a central mosque in @entity62 , the principal city of northern @entity37			0
a few weeks earlier , the terror group kidnapped at least 97 people , including many children , during raids on villages in @entity8			1
when earlier in the year they invaded the northern village of @entity70 , @entity1 militants went door - to - door , killing any man , woman or child they came across			1
​ and perhaps most infamously , last year some 220 girls were abducted from @entity76 by @entity1			1
sadly , there has been no news on their whereabouts , meaning none of these families know whether their daughters are safe			0
​ no one knows if his or her daughter has been married off , raped , violated or even whether she is alive or dead			0
every waking hour remains a nightmare for these families			0
@entity1 's ever more violent and ever more vicious abuse of children as weapons of war -- as victims , as slaves and as suicide bombers -- must be addressed , because the threat is only likely to grow			1
after all , the group 's leader , @entity98 , who has a $ 7 million ​ bounty on his head ​ , was seen last week in a video praising the jihadists who killed 17 people in the @entity106 attacks			1
​ @entity107 has described @entity108 as a " religious intellectual , yet also a gangster and vigilante as well as a mad leader			0
" with all this in mind , i am urging the international community to step up its pursuit , exposure and surveillance of @entity1 and to do more to coordinate action against their cross-border incursions into @entity37 , @entity123 , @entity124 and other countries			1
following the kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls in @entity76 , a special initiative for children was launched -- the safe schools ​ plan			1
it was in response to the news that children , fearful of further terrorist attacks , ​ had been staying away from school			1
the idea behind this is admirable -- the notion of safe schools and a universal call for every child to have the right to education , free of fear and intimidation			0
this plan is being put into place , and steps are being taken to fortify and guard schools , to improve security and to create a line of communication between schools and police and army			0
these new initiatives are backed by the @entity159 , passed by the @entity160 to stop the use of schools as military targets and to ensure that they are havens free from exploitation by terrorist groups			0
just as hospitals are regarded as protected under international law , so should schools			0
while better fortifications will of course not ultimately stop the carnage if a terrorist group is hellbent on an attack , the deterrent effect ​ of enhanced security measures offers at least a first line of defense			0
and it also sends the important message to parents that everything possible is being done to make schools safer for their children			1
over the last few weeks , $ 23 million has been raised for safe schools from the international community , and in the last few days the @entity187 and @entity188 have announced further help for the initiative			0
but we are calling on all aid agencies to support this innovative plan , one that could , if applied round the world , help children worried about the threat to their schools , in countries from @entity201 to @entity202			2
it is hard for many of us in the @entity205 to imagine what it is like to be scared even to travel to school , yet too many children around the world confront that fear every day			2
it is time for that to change .			0
