-- in 2013 , @entity0 bookworms turned to the masters			0
we asked our readers to vote on their top 10 favorite books of the year , and the results are filled with literary hotshots and household names			1
from @entity9 to @entity10 to @entity11 , the titles that turn up on our list of readers ' 10 favorite books of the year are going to be familiar whether you consider yourself a big reader or not			1
yet not all the spaces were taken up by the well - known greats : at least one book , " reconstructing @entity22 , " was threatened to be overshadowed by the fall 's onslaught of heavy - hitters , but @entity0 readers had n't forgotten its suspenseful tale			2
another surprise entry was @entity30 's " @entity29 " which , being a 2012 release , we did n't expect to see on a list of 2013 picks			0
but thanks to the numerous readers who wrote in votes for the tough but engrossing novel , @entity30 's work shines for another year			0
