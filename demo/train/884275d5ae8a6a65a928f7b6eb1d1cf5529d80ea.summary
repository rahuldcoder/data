@entity0 -- president @entity4 and @entity6 speaker @entity5 met over the weekend as part of ongoing negotiations on an agreement to reduce the country 's deficit , a @entity3 official told @entity1 late tuesday			1
also @entity4 said tuesday he invited @entity13 and @entity3 leaders from both chambers of @entity15 to the @entity6 for a meeting thursday to discuss deficit reduction and the need to raise the federal debt ceiling			1
@entity4 said he wanted the meeting to " build on the work that 's already been done and drive toward a final agreement " that would address expanding federal deficits and bring congressional approval for increasing how much money the government can borrow			2
senate minority leader @entity28 , who earlier invited @entity4 to come to @entity15 to discuss the issue , will attend the @entity6 meeting , his office announced			1
senate majority leader @entity31 also plans to attend			2
@entity5 indicated that he will take part but warned that @entity15 will not accept tax increases sought by @entity4 and @entity13			2
" i 'm happy to discuss these issues at the @entity6 , but such discussions will be fruitless until the president recognizes economic and legislative reality , " @entity5 , @entity34 , said in a statement			1
he added , " i 'm pleased the president stated today that we need to address the big , long - term challenges facing our country			2
" according to @entity4 , who made an unscheduled appearance in the @entity6 briefing room , talks on deficit reduction over the @entity46 weekend with congressional leaders from both parties made progress , but " we still have to work through some real differences			1
" both parties need to come out of their " comfort zone , " @entity4 said			2
but " this should not come down to the last second			2
" @entity6 spokesman @entity57 later said @entity4 believes that everyone knows the issues involved in forging a comprehensive agreement to reduce federal deficits by as much as $ 4 trillion in the coming decade			1
now it is time make hard decisions , with both sides compromising in order to reach an agreement that benefits the nation as a whole , @entity57 said			0
" the ideal will never become law , whether you 're a conservative @entity6 @entity3 or a @entity72 or the president of the @entity74 , " @entity57 said			1
" you 're never going to get everything you want , because our system does n't work like that			0
" the @entity79 returned to work tuesday , cutting short the planned weeklong @entity46 recess , with its leaders resuming their tough talk on negotiations to cut federal deficits amid a looming deadline to raise the government 's debt ceiling			1
the three - day @entity46 weekend did little to change the rhetoric of recent weeks over deficit reduction talks and the need for @entity15 to increase the amount of money the government can borrow			0
in his opening remarks after the @entity79 reconvened , @entity31 , @entity94 , accused @entity3 of putting the nation 's economic recovery at risk by threatening to oppose an increase in how much money the government can borrow			1
@entity102 , @entity103 , followed @entity31 by accusing @entity13 of wanting to increase spending to solve a deficit problem			0
before @entity4 's invitation , @entity102 repeated an invitation for @entity4 to come to @entity15 and hear from @entity3 why they wo n't support any agreement that includes tax increases			0
@entity31 said his side was willing to compromise but would not allow republicans to put the needs of " a few millionaires and billionaires " ahead of the rest of the country			2
with @entity6 members scheduled to return wednesday , congressional leaders remain at sharp odds over what sort of conditions should be attached to a hike in the current $ 14.3 trillion ceiling			1
@entity3 are refusing to go along with any increase unless it includes deep spending cuts and avoids any tax increases			0
@entity13 are trying to minimize the impact of cuts to social services and are calling for the elimination to certain tax breaks and loopholes benefiting wealthier @entity74			0
@entity135 officials and leading economists have warned of potentially catastrophic consequences if the ceiling is not raised by august 2 , at which point the country could default on its debt obligations			1
among other things , the country could face skyrocketing interest rates and a plummeting dollar			0
increasing the debt ceiling will allow the government to borrow more money in order to pay for spending already accrued			1
given the short time frame , @entity15 and the @entity6 may be forced to agree to a relatively small increase in the debt ceiling covering only a few months			1
such a compromise -- including cuts already agreed to on both sides of the aisle -- would give leaders more time to negotiate serious budget reforms , including possible changes to popular entitlement programs such as @entity160 and @entity161			2
however , @entity4 said he 's opposed to a short - term increase in the debt ceiling			1
" i do n't think the @entity74 people sent us here to avoid tough problems , " @entity4 said			1
the debt ceiling dispute is a " ' unique opportunity to do something big " and put the " economy on a stronger footing for the future			1
" over the weekend , top @entity13 and @entity3 gave no public indication that a potential compromise is in the offing			0
talks led by vice president @entity176 recently collapsed over the tax dispute			0
" the principle of not raising taxes is something that we campaigned on last november , and the results of the election was the @entity74 people do n't want their taxes raised and they wanted us to cut spending , " sen. @entity178 , @entity179 , said sunday on @entity1 's " @entity180			0
" " they do n't want compromise			0
" various frameworks for a possible deal have been floated			0
conservatives demand deep spending cuts , caps on future spending and a balanced budget amendment to the @entity198 in return for their support to raise the debt ceiling			1
both the @entity6 and @entity79 are planning votes on a balanced budget amendment in coming weeks			1
however , with such an amendment requiring approval from a two - thirds majority in both chambers and then ratification by at least 38 states , eventual approval is unclear in a process that can take years			0
for his part , @entity4 has chided congressional republicans for refusing to make " tough decisions " at odds with their conservative base			2
he calls for what he characterizes as a balanced approach to deficit reduction that includes more revenue for education , infrastructure and clean energy , areas he considers critical to long - term economic growth			0
the @entity13 position includes spending cuts elsewhere , including the military , as well as reforms to popular entitlement programs such as @entity160 and @entity161 , the government - run health care programs for senior citizens , the disabled and the indigent			0
@entity3 seek more sweeping entitlement reforms that @entity13 contend would eliminate the safety net the programs were intended to provide			0
@entity1 's @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity242 contributed to this report .			0
