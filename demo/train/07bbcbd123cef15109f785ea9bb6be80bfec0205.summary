-- @entity3 , the @entity5 - winning @entity4 author and anti-apartheid activist , died sunday , her family said monday			1
@entity3 died peacefully in her sleep , according to a statement from her family			1
she was awarded the @entity5 in 1991			1
her literary works , including " a @entity11 " ( 1970 ) , the @entity13 - winning " @entity12 " ( 1974 ) and " @entity14 " ( 1981 ) were cited by the @entity15 as " giving profound insights into the historical process ( and ) help ( ing ) to shape this process			1
" the @entity23 , calling her " @entity4 's grande dame of literature , " responded to her death in a news release			1
" we have lost a great writer , a patriot and strong voice for equality and democracy in the world , " said professor @entity26 , the foundation 's chairman			2
@entity35 , the former @entity4 president who died last december , was a friend of @entity3 's and read her books while incarcerated			1
in her novels , essays and other works , @entity3 was one of the leading voices against @entity4 's apartheid system , which segregated black and white people and led to decades of unrest			1
three of her novels , including " @entity46 " ( 1979 ) , were banned by the government -- a reaction she fully expected , given their subject matter			1
" i knew ' @entity46 ' would be banned because i even put in it ... sometimes scattered little pamphlets in the street , you know , which were swept up			2
but i always picked these things up , and i think i put one almost in its entirety in the book , so that would be enough for it to be banned			2
what else could you do ? " she said in a 2009 interview			2
" @entity46 " was about the child of a white anti-apartheid activist who had died in prison after attempting to overthrow the government			2
it includes a description of the 1976 @entity70 uprising			0
however , she told fellow author @entity72 that her works were n't about politics , but about people			2
" to be a writer is to enter into public life			0
i look upon our process as writers as discovery of life , " she told him in 2012			0
indeed , @entity3 was as praised for her writing ability as she was for her stand on issues			1
her literary voice " is as clear and crisp as @entity90 's , " wrote @entity89 's @entity88			0
" her eye for the betraying detail , for the physical sensations of @entity4 heat and dust , reminds you of the great masters of location : @entity101 's @entity100 or @entity102 ­ a @entity104 ¡ rquez 's @entity103			1
" nevertheless , she never shrank from speaking her mind			0
in recent years , she had criticized what is known as the " @entity107 , " which gave the government great leeway to decide what information should be protected , as well as to prosecute violators			2
the bill , though approved by @entity4 's parliament in 2013 , was n't signed by president @entity114 , who returned it to the legislature			1
@entity3 was born in @entity4 in 1923 , the daughter of @entity119 immigrants			1
she was a thoughtful observer from a young age , noting the inequities of @entity4 society while attending an all - girls , all - white catholic school			1
" i early on began to realize how artificial our life was , " she said			0
but despite her recognition of societal problems , she said she was sometimes reluctant to speak up herself			0
when pondering " @entity46 , " she thought the topic would be better handled by a veteran of activist families			0
" i waited a long time to do it , because i thought , i am not in this , " she said			0
" i 'm neither a parent nor a child			0
i 'm waiting for somebody to write it who would know more about it than i did			0
" nobody did , so i did			0
" @entity3 was married twice			1
her second husband , @entity140 , to whom she was married for 47 years , died in 2001			0
she is survived by two children			0
