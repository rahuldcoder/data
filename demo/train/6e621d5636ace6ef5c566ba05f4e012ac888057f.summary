-- " beware the fury of the patient man			2
" -- @entity3 in january , 1956 , @entity5 president @entity4 was pledging to take over @entity6			1
in the @entity7 , a " sensational new @entity15 , " just days away from cracking the music charts with his first hit , " @entity14 , " was touring with @entity11 and the stars of @entity13			2
@entity16 was preparing to change her name			2
also that month , a fresh - faced @entity7 senator gave @entity19 an autographed copy of his second book , " @entity22 "			2
in that best - seller , @entity23 applauded leaders with the courage to represent " the actual sentiments of the silent majority of their constituents in opposition to the screams of a vocal minority			1
" that " silent majority " was a constituency neither @entity19 nor the country would forget : fifty - six years later , @entity37 is counting on it to win the presidency			1
@entity19 could have thanked @entity23 's hardcover for one of his many resurrections			1
his appeal to the " silent majority " turned around his political fortunes , driving his approval ratings from the mid- 50s to more than 80 %			1
opinion : both parties have a huge race problem his pivotal speech contrasted a " vocal minority " of idealistic but impractical , young , @entity56 protestors , cultural elites and intellectuals with their stodgy parents , older , blue - collar , working - class @entity7			1
until @entity19 drew the silent majority from the shadows , their simmering outrage at the left 's lack of respect for time - tested @entity7 values was undetected			1
political historian @entity66 characterized the split between " what the silent people think " and what the country 's " more important thinkers think			1
" he wrote , " never have @entity7 's leading cultural media , its university thinkers , its influence makers been more intrigued by experiment and change ; but in no election have the mute masses more completely separated themselves from such leadership and thinking			1
" at least , until today			0
by some measures , little has changed since the seminal year of 1969			1
@entity16 remains a powerful symbol of fragile , sexual romanticism			0
the @entity85 world still lusts for the @entity87 territory			0
@entity88 is making more money than ever			0
and we are still fighting the @entity91			0
the division between @entity19 's silent majority , on one hand , and , on the other , @entity93 - leaning young voters , @entity98 stars , academia , the music industry , fashionistas , and news media elites has never repaired itself			1
in the " @entity104 , " @entity103 chronicled how the social ferment of the 60 's not only failed to overthrow establishment culture , but was absorbed by it			1
the counter-culture of the 60s revolution turned into the " @entity110 " of the 80s			0
they settled into entitled consumerism , grew fat and became today 's establishment			2
now the counterculture defines itself by the brands it wears , not the institutions it protests			0
being different today requires the latest iphone and a vanilla , extra-shot latte			0
the counter culture wears a @entity126 swoosh , not a tie - died shirt			0
the @entity128 , born in protest against the war that has defined all future wars , has become a culture of locust - like consumption			0
it devours public and private resources			0
it remains allied against the previous generation 's antiquated ethos of self - discipline , personal responsibility and moderation			2
over five decades , the counterculture became our culture			0
it expanded its home within the @entity147 , finding its identity challenging the quaint social norms of tragically uncool @entity150			0
we are an easy cultural target			2
we are suspicious of all cutting - edge music , abstract art , avant - garde style and trendy thought			0
we advocate unimaginative self - restraint and standards we often fail to meet -- and we get no credit for trying			0
our imperfections are labeled hypocritical , not human			0
and in 2008 , it found its leader , the coolest president ever			2
president @entity164 hangs out with movie stars , makes no decisions without consulting the academic elite and sings like @entity168			1
@entity164 is the president of cool @entity7			1
to oppose him , where did @entity150 turn ? we chose the strait - laced personification of everything @entity164 is not			1
we made ourselves even more dated			0
@entity37 is the chaperone to be eluded at every prom			1
he 's common - sense parental advice , not counter-intuitive academic insight			2
he has stepped down , fresh and perfect , from a @entity180 painting			0
as @entity181 notes in the @entity182 , an emotional outburst from the proper @entity37 is limited to saying " the heck with it			1
" even my own daughter writes that @entity37 's " tendency to say ' shoot ' and ' darn it ' tells us he 's from another generation			1
" being terminally uncool , however , may be the secret of @entity37 's success			1
@entity19 's majority was silent a long time , until aroused by @entity164 , whose self - admitted superiority led him to denigrate their bitter attachment to their values			1
they slept , this quiet group of @entity7 who worked hard , paid their taxes and played by the rules , until awakened by a president who violated their core ethic of responsibility , telling them the cure for too much debt is even more debt			2
and now they are frightened			0
they worry that everything they 've worked for is being consumed , leaving only a bare orchard of fruitless trees and leafless branches			0
they have heard an alarm			0
and now they stand to defend what is plain and boring and true			0
they rise to tell us their values , like the lines on the side of the road , are there for a purpose			0
they are there to keep us straight			0
now it is the silent majority who takes to the streets in protest of their government 's fiscal fantasies			1
they are adults , rising to say that their country 's time - honored values are not luxuries we can discard , but obligations that must be met			2
their children , who think themselves the first generation with the mental capacity to understand the world 's problems , stare at them			2
they confuse their parent 's civility with softness			2
they are baffled to hear that success requires self - discipline -- not just self - indulgence , good intentions and intellect			0
polls say this race is tied			0
the president of cool is suddenly in a tight race against @entity7 's most uncool parent			1
are the " mute masses " @entity19 aroused still a majority ? early turnout and absentee voting data from the @entity274 indicates that @entity150 vote totals are up over 2 % from 2008 while @entity93 totals are down 6 %			2
@entity150 pollsters report republicans are heading into 2012 with a significant advantage in voter interest and intensity			0
no - drama @entity164 has got the cool			1
all @entity37 has is the fury of the patient man			1
if he wins , @entity37 could make being uncool , cool again			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity287 .			1

@entity287 says election may echo old split between cultural elite , silent majority
he says @entity164 is *widely* viewed as the " cool president , " @entity37 is the opposite of cool
@entity287 : could @entity37 's persona be a plus in this year 's election ?
