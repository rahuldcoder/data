@entity0 -- @entity2 weakened to a tropical depression late sunday , the @entity4 reported , but not before dumping vast amounts of rain and causing extensive flooding in @entity9 states			1
the plodding storm had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph -- down considerably from earlier -- as it headed 7 mph in an east - northeasterly direction			1
yet while it winds have died down , @entity2 remained a threat as it moved toward the @entity15 and points to the east and north , with its intense rains producing potential problems especially in already saturated areas			1
by sunday night , state and local officials -- plus the @entity24 page for @entity26 's emergency management division and @entity0 mayor @entity27 -- had reported flooding in numerous @entity26 parishes including @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			1
@entity36 also was hard hit			2
a news release sunday from its emergency management agency pointed to several flooded roads and damaged homes in @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity45 counties			2
and the website for @entity47 , a major utility in the area , showed mostly pockets of power outages as far west as the @entity53 suburbs and as far north as @entity54			2
centered over southern @entity26 , the storm continued to pump out rain -- as much as 20 inches expected in spots through monday night , according to the @entity4 -- as it chugged northward sunday toward the @entity58			1
in an advisory , the center warned , " these rains are expected to cause extensive flooding			1
" the storm had caused numerous headaches , but not the devastation of last week 's @entity65 , which killed more than 40 people and left millions without power			0
nor has it compared with @entity70 , which killed more than 1,000 people in @entity26 , @entity36 and other @entity9 states six years ago			1
@entity72 was one of those directly affected by @entity70 , which killed his mother and granddaughter and caused much of his house to literally float away			0
on sunday , the resident of @entity0 ' @entity79 tracked the storm and prepared for the worst			1
" we 're making sure that we keep up with what 's going on with the storm , so that what happened in 2005 does n't happen again , " he said			0

" in a press conference in @entity0 on sunday afternoon , @entity27 characterized @entity2 as a " very stubborn , persistent , slow - moving unpredictable event			1
" he noted that the storm , by then , had dumped 10 to 13 inches of rain on the city and brought wind gusts of up to 50 mph that caused minor flooding and prompted 60 calls to authorities for downed trees			1
yet @entity0 is otherwise fully functional , with all 24 pump stations in the city " 100 % operational " and just more than 200 people without power , down significantly from saturday , the mayor said			1
the mayor , though , warned residents not to be complacent , especially with continued tornado threats and rain bands that could dump between 2 to 4 inches at a time and cause flash floods			1
" we 're not out of the woods yet , " @entity27 said			0
other @entity9 communities , however , have experienced more severe flooding			2
that includes the city of @entity113 , across @entity114 , which was buried sunday beneath feet of water			0
" normally there is a street here , " said @entity116 , who sent @entity118 videos from flooded areas of the city sunday			0
mailboxes were barely sticking out over the water			0
in @entity32 , water pored over the top of levees and flooded parts of @entity131 , prompting its closure , the parish said in a news release			0
rapidly rising waters also trapped some cattle , which survived after being steered to higher ground			0
coastal residents knew the storm was coming , and many took precautions			0
" we are a sturdy people			0
all @entity143 are willing and able to weather any storm , " said @entity141 of @entity142 , @entity26 , just west of @entity0 , in an @entity118 saturday			1
in its 10 p.m. ct sunday advisory , the @entity4 reported that @entity2 's center was expected to move across southern @entity36 overnight and monday			1
" little change in strength is expected in the next day or so as @entity2 becomes an extra-tropical cyclone , " the center added			1
over time , it is expected to dump considerable rain in the eastern part of the country -- including @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 , where grounds are drenched and rivers are already full after @entity65			0
the hurricane center noted sunday night that " flooding rains ( are ) expected to spread from the @entity9 to the @entity15			1
" " it will ... be a long , slow trip through the @entity164 into the @entity15 , " said @entity1 meteorologist @entity162			0
" heavy rain and inland flooding continue to be the greatest concern			2
" @entity2 " is expected to connect with a cold front moving through the @entity169 today , " @entity162 said sunday			1
" this will bring rain up and down the @entity172 on monday and will cause heavy travel delays for most major metropolitan areas on the @entity176 holiday			2
in addition , the cold front will bring 1 to 3 inches of rain to the already flood - weary @entity180 , including @entity157 and @entity156 , that were hit hard by ( @entity181 ) @entity65			2
" after being in effect for days , all tropical storm warnings for the @entity9 were discontinued sunday night			2
@entity26 gov. @entity184 had urged state residents saturday to " use extreme caution			2

a storm surge of more than 2 feet was recorded just south of @entity207 , @entity26 , at @entity208 , the center said			2
the storm forced oil and gas producers to halt operations in the region amid threats of flooding in parts of @entity26 , @entity36 and @entity195			1
some energy producers evacuated employees ahead of the storm			0
about 60 % of oil production in the @entity9 and more than half of natural gas production have been shut down , according to the @entity223			0
