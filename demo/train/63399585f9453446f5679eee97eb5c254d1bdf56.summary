like a wounded animal lashing out in fury , @entity1 is betraying hints of desperation in its latest video , which purportedly shows the aftermath of the beheading of @entity11 hostage @entity9 , analysts said sunday			1
and if there 's news worse than the apparent brutal death of @entity9 , it 's that we should expect even more vicious videos to come from the group , also known by the acronym @entity1 , said @entity20 of the @entity21 , an anti-extremist think tank			1
" as we see the @entity11 and the coalition making gains against @entity1 , we will find that they try and show that they are still strong , try and show that they are just as barbaric as they have been , and unfortunately one of the things we 'll see is that the videos will become more and more barbaric , " he said			1
" i think it 's a sign of desperation , " he said			0
" i think it 's a sign that they know and feel they are under attack , they 're under siege and they 're struggling			0
" the video , released online sunday , shows the aftermath of a beheading , in which the victim is not clearly recognizable			2
the @entity42 confirmed that the video showed @entity9			0
@entity9 , 26 , who converted to @entity44 in captivity , also went by the name @entity47			0
he went to the @entity48 as a @entity11 soldier and returned as a medical worker , feeling compelled to help victims of war			1
the video does show -- in gruesome detail -- the beheadings of what the group claims are pilots for the @entity60 government , which is also battling @entity1 forces			1
" it ca n't be said enough , " said @entity63 's @entity62			0
" this is the most barbaric they 've done so far			0
" the carefully produced video is clearly " a prize piece of propaganda for them , " @entity62 says			0
it also differs from others produced by @entity1			2
it does n't feature a @entity74 hostage dressed in orange speaking to the camera before his death			0
nor does it name the group 's next victim			0
it is likely in part meant to scare @entity60 and @entity84 into obeying @entity1 ' orders when it comes calling , said @entity20 and retired @entity87 lt. col. @entity86 , a counterterrorism expert			1
" what @entity1 is telling them is , ' when we come in and tell you to do what we tell you , you know what the consequences are if you say no , ' " @entity86 said			2
but it also comes at a time when the @entity11 and its anti-isis allies are claiming their airstrikes and support for ground forces fighting the group are beginning to slowly turn the tide , said retired @entity11 maj. gen. @entity105			1
has @entity1 peaked ? terror group suffers setbacks in @entity84 it also comes during a visit to @entity84 by the chairman of the @entity112 , gen. @entity113			2
" clearly there are no coincidences , " @entity114 told @entity63 on sunday			0
" this is timed very specifically to those activities by the coalition and , i would say , the results of those activities			2
" since beginning airstrikes in august , @entity11 officials have touted successes in disrupting @entity1 communications and logistics , slowing its advances and forcing fighters to disperse into smaller formations			1
last week , president @entity129 said the fight was entering a new phase that would rely heavily on @entity84 ground troops and other local fighters			2
more recently , @entity11 officials have suggested more openness to a role for @entity11 ground forces in the fight			1
in testimony to the @entity138 on thursday , @entity113 said commanders are " certainly considering " the prospect that @entity11 forces might be needed to retake the @entity84 city of @entity143 , currently held by @entity1			1
in sunday 's video , the narrator taunted @entity129 to do just that			0

video in part aimed at local residents , analysts say
video suggests @entity1 is feeling the sting of @entity11 and coalition airstrikes , analysts say
release timed to counter coalition claims that @entity1 fight is succeeding , retired general says
unfortunately , even more barbaric videos are likely , they say
