@entity0 -- the @entity3 is grounding more than 100 planes used to support ground troops in @entity6 and @entity7 because of fatigue cracks in the wings , @entity3 officials said friday			1
aircraft like this @entity10 provide close support to ground troops in @entity6 and @entity7			1
the officials said 127 @entity12 , including some used in the @entity13 , will be grounded until they are each inspected for the cracks			0
" the inspections are a necessary step in addressing the risk associated with a- 10 wing cracking , specifically with thin - skin wings			2
this risk is of great concern to the @entity3 and is representative of a systemic problem for our aging @entity3 fleet , " the @entity3 said			0
the @entity10 , nicknamed the " @entity10 " because of its unique un-aerodynamic look , is one of the @entity3 's older aircraft , having first been delivered to the service in 1975			2
the average age of the @entity12 fleet is now 28 years , but the entire @entity3 fleet has an average age of 25 years , according to @entity3 statistics			1
the @entity3 has more than 400 a- 10s in its fleet			0
the cracks in the older a- 10 a-models and a- 10 c - models were discovered at @entity39 in @entity40 during routine maintenance			2
no a- 10 has had an accident because of the cracks just discovered , according to @entity3 officials			1
the inspection of the 127 planes will give priority to the planes in the @entity6 and @entity7 theaters of battle , officials said			1
the plane was designed as a tank killer , with a front - mounted @entity53 gun that fires 30 - mm armor - piercing ammunition capable of destroying a tank			0
the planes are now primarily used in @entity6 and @entity7 to protect ground troops in close combat situations , flying low and slow and with the ability to target individuals hidden on mountainsides or rooftops			1
last year , the @entity3 grounded hundreds of f - 15 fighter jets after one fell apart during a training mission			0
the culprit was a fatigued longeron , a part that holds the fuselage together			0
numerous f - 15s flying in @entity6 and @entity7 also were grounded until they were inspected , forcing the service to fly other aircraft in their place			2
the @entity74 was also asked to help cover the f - 15 missions during the weeks they were grounded .			0

127 a- 10 @entity77 will be grounded because of fatigue cracks in wings
@entity81 10s first delivered to @entity3 in 1975 ; average age is 28 years
none of the cracks has been *attributed* to accidents
