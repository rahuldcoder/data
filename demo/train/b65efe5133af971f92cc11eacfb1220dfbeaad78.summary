she reached out and grabbed her husband " and is touching him and starts to really choke him like she was really trying to hug him			2

also thursday , first lady @entity171 released an open letter to parents about the shooting			0
" in the days and weeks ahead , as we struggle with these issues ourselves , many of us will find that our children are struggling with them as well , " she wrote			0
" the questions my daughters have asked are the same ones that many of your children will have -- and they do n't lend themselves to easy answers			0

the next step , doctors told reporters thursday , is the removal of @entity3 ' breathing tube			1
she is breathing on her own " with very little support , " @entity130 said , but he was n't sure when the tube might come out			0
@entity3 is " becoming more and more alert at this time , " he said , telling reporters she acts like someone waking up in the morning -- yawning and rubbing her eyes			1

doctors have cautiously described @entity3 ' recovery as going according to plan , so far absent of any complications or issues , and have said throughout that she has been able to communicate when they lessen her sedation and allow her to awaken			2
@entity17 said he was in the room when @entity3 opened her eyes , saying it might have been the " unexpected familiarity " of having close friends visit that perhaps @entity3 was n't expecting			1
" this is the part that doctors , i think , have the hardest time with -- those intangibles in medicine , " he said , referring to the role that family and friends can play in prompting patient progress			2
