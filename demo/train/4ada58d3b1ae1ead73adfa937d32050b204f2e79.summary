@entity0 , @entity1 -- when you say " @entity6 " and then throw in words such as mystique , storied and blessed , you create as many folks rolling their eyes as wiping away tears of joy			1
this has been so throughout the 125 seasons of football for the @entity14 , especially when they are good			0
well , forget about placing " @entity6 " and " good " in the same sentence for a moment			1
with overwhelming losses to supposedly inferior foes on a consistent basis and underwhelming coaches from @entity21 to @entity22 to @entity23 , " @entity6 " has been " mediocre " or less during the last two decades			1
now , with @entity24 in his third year of leading the @entity14 while having the fourth-most victories of any coach among the big boys of college football since 2006 , " @entity6 " is flirting with " greatness " at 7 - 0 despite a monster schedule and all those haters			1
this gets a little confusing			0
after all , no team this side of the @entity35 , @entity37 basketball and the @entity38 is more polarizing than the famous -- or is that the infamous ? -- one that resides among the majestic oaks , maples and pines of @entity44			0
@entity6 can further its return to prominence saturday night , when it takes its no. 5 ranking in the @entity50 standings on the road to no. 8 @entity52			1
not surprisingly , @entity52 head coach @entity53 is calling this the biggest game for his team in 12 years -- maybe ever -- because it 's @entity6			1
it will be televised nationally on @entity57 , and the ratings will be huge , partly because of the game 's magnitude , but mostly because of the staggering number of @entity6 haters and lovers			1
i 'll show you how this works , and i 'll start with a confession : i was born and raised a few punts from the @entity6 campus			2
not only that , i was at the @entity14 's home game last week against @entity71 during their attempt on a heavily overcast afternoon to remain undefeated this late in a season for the first time since 2002			0
they trailed @entity71 by four points deep into the third quarter , but then something happened -- first away from the playing field and then on it			0
the sun burst through the clouds , and as i looked to my left inside the @entity84 press box toward the nearby @entity85 , i saw the brightest of sunlight touching the face of @entity89 on the mosaic that is as high as half a football field			0
they call the @entity93 around here			0
needless to say , @entity6 's offense promptly roared to the end zone after that to take a lead the @entity14 would never relinquish			2
then , after the @entity6 @entity100 finished its eternal playing of the @entity102 at the end , the @entity99 players gathered before the student section for one of @entity6 's slew of traditions			2
the others ? the pep rallies on the friday night before every home game , with a crowd as high as 20,000 at times			1
the public luncheon ( average attendance of 1,500 ) that happens on the friday afternoon before every home game			2
the lighting of candles on campus at the grotto for miracles ranging from game - winning field goals to huge interceptions			0
the @entity124 , featuring those from the @entity6 marching band spending 45 minutes in front of the @entity129 leading cadences and cheers			2
but back to the @entity71 game , when @entity6 players continued a post-game home tradition that happens whether they win or lose			1
after they reached the front of the student section , they joined those who remained from the sellout crowd of more than 80,000 to sing @entity6 's alma mater called " @entity6 , our mother			2
you may roll your eyes now			0
i have n't even mentioned that the whole @entity146 these days is inspired by @entity147 , the @entity14 's senior linebacker from @entity148 with a story built for @entity150 -- you know , like the one about @entity152 , otherwise known as @entity152			1
@entity152 was the @entity6 running back who played for legendary @entity6 coach @entity155 from 1917 to 1920 before his death from a throat infection			1
@entity6 's dynamic coach and player duo inspired the phrase " @entity161 , " and they were immortalized in the 1940 's movie " @entity155 , @entity164			1
" somebody named @entity166 played @entity152			1
to hear political pundits tell it , that role contributed to his earning the right to spend two terms in the @entity173			0
you may roll your eyes again			0
either that , or you can wait to hear more about @entity147 , the undisputed leader of @entity6 's bone - crunching defense			1
before @entity6 went to then - 10th - ranked @entity181 in september , @entity147 's grandmother and girlfriend died in @entity148 within six hours of each other			1
along the way to a 20 - 3 victory , he had 12 tackles , broke up two passes and intercepted the first pass of his four - year @entity6 career			2
after the interception , @entity147 pointed to the sky , with emotion -- the kind he sends through the rest of his teammates			2
" there are a lot of leaders that think a quality of a leader is just to talk , " @entity147 told me after the @entity71 game			2
" i think the strongest leaders are those who not only verbally communicate but communicate by action			0
" exhibit a : with much help from @entity147 , the @entity99 rank second in the nation by allowing opponents just an average of nine points per game			2
they also possess the only defense at the @entity215 's highest level of football that has n't allowed a rushing touchdown			0
@entity147 leads the team in tackles , ranks second in the nation in forcing turnovers ( four interceptions , two fumble recoveries ) and is among the handful of legitimate candidates for the @entity227 , which is college football 's top individual award			0
he would join @entity181 's @entity229 ( 1997 ) as the only person to win the @entity227 as primarily a defensive player			0
he also would help @entity6 break its tie with the @entity233 for the school with the most @entity227 winners ( 7 )			0
( seven trophies also have gone to @entity237 , but two went to the same player			0
) in addition , when it comes to @entity240 and the @entity242 / @entity241 ( formerly the @entity243 ) polls , @entity6 has more consensus national championships than anybody ( 11 )			1
nobody has more consensus @entity164 than @entity6 's 80 , and the @entity99 lead everybody in first - round @entity252 draft picks with 63 and in overall no. 1 @entity252 draft picks with five			0
still , the haters would mention @entity6 has n't won a national championship since 1988			1
in contrast , the lovers would mention @entity147 is n't alone as an @entity99 star these days			1
@entity6 has other splendid players , such as future @entity252 tight end @entity261 , athletically gifted quarterback @entity262 and the speedy 6 - 6 and 303 pounds of @entity263 at defensive end			0
with @entity24 's expertise and the @entity152 's guidance , they are on the verge of turning @entity6 's glory days of the past into those of the present and the future			1
you may roll your eyes some more .			0

@entity6 has n't won a national championship since 1988
however , pep rallies friday nights before home games host crowds of 20,000
coach / player duo @entity155 and @entity152 were immortalized in the 1940 film
today fans are inspired by @entity147 , who played the day his girlfriend and grandmother died
