" it 's still so surreal that i 've walked in shows like @entity59 and @entity57			1
" like anything @entity68 - related , @entity30 's presence in this world has not come without controversy : where models are dodging street style photographers , she 's dodging paparazzi and hit pieces in the media about the distraction her presence brings			1
compared with some of her high - fashion counterparts who can walk upwards of 20 runways during the weeklong event before heading to @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 , @entity30 is still a fledgling in her second season , with three shows thus far			1

" when i was a kid , i could n't have a slumber party for one night without crying myself to sleep and telling my dad to pick me up at 10 o'clock at night , " @entity30 said			2
