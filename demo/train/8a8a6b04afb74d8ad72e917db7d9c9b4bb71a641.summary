-- i am an @entity2			0
when i was growing up in a small town in @entity5 , the @entity3 i lived in cherished diversity and the freedom to worship , regardless of one 's religion			1
people of various faiths resided in my community : protestants , @entity15 , jews , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			2
how a person prayed was never a factor in how we treated each other			0
yet today , @entity17 in @entity3 are viewed as suspect and legitimate targets for surveillance by the @entity28 because of their faith			1
this is not the @entity3 i know , and it is time for the courts to weigh in and ban discriminatory policing by the @entity28			1
let me be clear : anyone who engages in criminal acts should be stopped and brought to justice			0
but the @entity28 can do that without targeting an entire community for blanket surveillance			1
the @entity28 has been spying on @entity3 @entity17 in @entity5 as well as in towns , communities and college campuses throughout the @entity43			1
in @entity45 , for example , the @entity28 visited mosques , schools , @entity17 - owned restaurants and small stores and took photographs and videos of people and their cars , collecting information about ordinary people 's daily lives , clothing and eating habits			1
@entity17 have been a part of @entity3 since the first slave ships arrived			1
we have contributed to our nation 's growth and fought and given up our lives defending it			0
today , we are as diverse as our nation : we are white , black , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			0
we are teachers , doctors , lawyers , engineers , store owners and business leaders			0
we are members of the military and @entity78			0
but living freely as a muslim in @entity3 today has become increasingly difficult			1
in @entity5 and @entity45 , worshipers at local mosques fear that their discussions may be monitored and misinterpreted by police informants			0
store owners wonder whether one of the customers might be an undercover cop looking to eavesdrop			0
parents of college students caution their children about participating in @entity17 student group activities			2
more than 100 faiths and civil liberties organizations have publicly objected to the @entity28 's conduct			1
they are joined by numerous public officials , including 35 members of @entity78			0
@entity98 mayor @entity97 and @entity45 gov. @entity99 have voiced their objections			0
@entity103 of @entity45 , @entity104 of @entity105 and @entity106 of @entity107 have recently introduced a resolution condemning the @entity28 's discriminatory practices and calling for an investigation of the @entity28			1
despite all this outrage , @entity5 , @entity45 , @entity112 and federal officials with an obligation to enforce the law and protect @entity3 have refused to launch an investigation			2
that is why today , victims of @entity28 's spying program have stepped up and filed a lawsuit against the police department , asking a federal court in @entity45 to ban religious discrimination by law enforcement			1
since public officials with direct oversight responsibility have turned a blind eye toward this bigotry , the victims have bravely come forward , turning to the courts as a last resort			2
this lawsuit is about the pervasive and discriminatory policies and practices that commissioner @entity136 and his leadership team have put into motion and that need to stop			2
standing up to the largest police department in the country takes courage , and these brave individuals have done so in order to protect @entity3 's future			1
the plaintiffs in this lawsuit include college students , a military serviceman who has put his life on the front lines in @entity151 and a small - business owner who is also a @entity153 veteran			0
they are ordinary @entity3 just trying to live a normal life , raising their families and supporting their country			2
these plaintiffs are parents , students , business leaders and service members who enrich our communities			0
their only " crime " is that they are @entity17 in @entity3			1
throughout our nation 's history , the courts have often been called upon to protect fundamental rights and defend justice			2
following this well - worn path , @entity3 @entity17 are now raising their voices and knocking on the courthouse door , determined that our system of justice will protect the rights of all @entity3			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			0

@entity177 : @entity17 are targets of surveillance by the @entity28 because of their faith
@entity177 : victims of @entity28 's spying program are stepping up to file a lawsuit
she says living freely as a @entity17 in @entity3 today has become increasingly difficult
@entity177 : it is time for the courts to weigh in and ban discriminatory action by the police
