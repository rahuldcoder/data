-- @entity2 wo n't say much about the next " @entity3 " film , which he is directing â € ” though info about casting and the story has piled up in bits and pieces			1
now a new bit , from @entity2 ' himself : at a @entity11 press conference for " @entity12 , " an entrepreneurial audience member asked the filmmaker about longtime collaborator and composer @entity14 , who has provided the score for most every major @entity2 work			1
the audience member asked : would @entity14 also do the score for " @entity3 ? " the short answer : no â € ” @entity20 , most famous for composing the six other " @entity3 " films , will , probably			1
the longer answer : @entity14 is great ! but so is @entity20 ! ' @entity23 ' renewed by @entity24 for season 3 @entity2 was caught on tape saying this , so it 'll be hard for him to drape it in much mystery , though questions persist : have they had a formal meeting about working together ? requests to both @entity2 and @entity20 for comment were not immediately returned			1
' @entity36 ' : top 4 power list revisited see @entity2 ' full comments about @entity14 and @entity20 below : can you talk a little about @entity14 's music and will he be scoring @entity3 too , or not ? @entity14 is an incredible composer who i was lucky enough to begin working with on @entity42			1
he was doing videogame soundtracks and we started working together then and have done a number of films and television series since			2
he is brilliant and it 's very easy for me to say to him , looking at a scene , " okay , this scene needs to be about the conflict between these characters			0
it 's got to be hopeful but you also have to feel that there 's a tension still			0
" i can say all these ridiculous things and he has to listen and say " okay " and go off and come back and present music that invariably does that but so much more			0
he 's truly one of the most influential members of our crew and i think this score , he just really out did himself , especially with the score for @entity65 's character			2
i think that suite that he wrote was just brilliant			0
again , for @entity3 it is very early days to know but i believe that going forward @entity20 will be doing that film , because apparently he was there long before i was			2
