the @entity1 decision to cripple the finances of the insurgent @entity3 has put the limelight on its influential and respected leader , @entity6			1
based in @entity8 , a tribal area of @entity9 , the group is aligned with the @entity10 and @entity11 and is considered one of the most significant threats to stability in @entity15			1
@entity16 , a senior analyst with the @entity17 , said @entity19 , as he is known to intelligence sources , is the " name , the face " and the " guy with all the clout " in a group that has been a major problem for coalition forces along the @entity15 - @entity9 border			2
" he 's very , very competent , a very capable leader who has really grown the network over the past five , six years , " @entity16 said			2
@entity29 labels @entity9 - based group as terrorists @entity1 intelligence officials believe @entity6 began turning the @entity3 into a " killing machine " in 2007			1
the network -- long regarded as a proxy of @entity9 security services -- is believed to have been behind a slew of attacks			1
one was a 2008 coordinated suicide bomb attack on the @entity40 in @entity41 that left six dead			0
another was a strike in june 2011 that killed 12 at the @entity44			0
a third was an attack on a military base near @entity41 around 10 years after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks that left 77 coalition soldiers injured			0
the @entity6 clan is believed to be holding @entity53 sgt. @entity52 , who disappeared in june 2009 after finishing guard duty at a combat outpost in southeastern @entity15 's @entity57 province , @entity1 military officials have said			1
the @entity10 previously claimed to have captured the soldier but it is possible , because of the close ties between the two groups , that @entity52 was handed over to the @entity3			2
secretary of state @entity62 will notify @entity63 of her intent to formally designate the @entity9 - based @entity3 as a terror organization on friday , @entity29 said			1
individual commanders such as @entity6 have already been blacklisted			2
the @entity1 put a $ 5 million bounty on him shortly after the @entity68 designated him as a supporter of global terrorism			0
but @entity29 's plan to designate the group as a @entity73 and a @entity75 entity would make it easier to pursue those who provide support for the movement			2
@entity6 has taken over leadership of the group from his father , @entity82 -- once considered a @entity1 ally because of his role organizing @entity15 fighters in the war against the @entity87 in the 1980s			2
the elder @entity6 developed a close relationship with @entity10 leaders and @entity90 after the war with the @entity87 , according to writings of journalist @entity93 , one of the foremost experts on @entity11 , the @entity10 and @entity15			2
the @entity3 , a family and a terror group the top leadership is a " family business , " said @entity99 , managing editor of @entity100 , a website that tracks terror - related events and trends			1
along with @entity6 , @entity82 's son @entity104 and brother @entity104 run the network 's extensive financial operation			1
another son , @entity108 , had been the day - to - day operational commander , but last month he was reported killed in a drone strike			0
the @entity10 denied reports of his death , but @entity16 said authorities have confirmed the killing			0
@entity108 's death will " seriously alter " the daily operations , he said			0
" @entity19 will take a little more of an active role " as a result , " picking the slack in the meantime , " @entity16 said			0
@entity6 has been described as the more radicalized and more violent of @entity82 's sons			1
he is " very much into the global extremism of @entity11			0
... he has got those ties ( to @entity11 ) so he tends to be more violent than his father ever was , " according to @entity125 , which cited an unnamed @entity1 intelligence official			0
several security experts and @entity1 military officials say he has extended the @entity3 's reach to countries far from @entity9 and @entity15			1
the group has managed to recruit fighters in @entity133 and @entity134 , for example , according to a november 2010 @entity125 's report			0
since 2001 , global security experts have said the @entity3 's specialty has been bold and complex suicide bombing attacks			1
in a rare interview , @entity6 told @entity141 in 2010 that the group 's fighters were becoming more advanced and that in the future their techniques " will be even better			2
" " at the beginning of this war , the coordination between our fighters was useless , " he said			0
" but there are so many attacks now , we ca n't count them ourselves			0
but it 's still not enough			0
the future will show what i mean			0
" @entity16 said @entity6 is " increasingly seen as a respected figure in the tribal areas			1
" he has the ability to " hold sway with a variety of militant groups harboring different agendas			0
" they pay deference to @entity19 , he said			0
" he 's supposedly pretty sharp and maintains very good relations " with entities ranging from @entity11 and its affiliates and @entity9 's security services , @entity16 said			1
@entity1 and @entity9 intelligence have estimated the @entity3 has between 4,000 and 12,000 fighters			1
adm. @entity172 , the former chairman of the @entity173 , said that the @entity3 acted " as a veritable arm of @entity9 's intelligence			1
" the allegations have strained relations between @entity178 and @entity179 , which have been in an uneasy alliance in the war against terror since 2001			0
the relationship between @entity9 intelligence and the @entity3 goes back to the @entity87 occupation of @entity15 when @entity9 , @entity186 and the @entity1 supported the resistance			1
intelligence officials believe @entity9 still regards the @entity3 as an important tool in countering @entity191 influence in @entity15 and helping shape any future peace process			1
