attorney general @entity0 led federal and local officials tuesday in announcing a massive overhaul of the @entity3 , which has been plagued for years by corruption , excessive use of force , illegal searches and widespread racial discrimination			1
in what @entity0 called the most wide - ranging such agreement in the nation 's history , the @entity9 and @entity3 reached a deal on a consent decree that was filed in federal court in @entity17			1
the deal includes more than 100 recommendations dealing with virtually every aspect of the department			1
" the consent decree requires the @entity22 to make broad changes in policies and practices relating to use of force , stops , searches , arrests , and interrogations , " @entity0 said			1
assistant attorney general @entity31 , who heads the @entity32 and played a key role in the agreement , joined @entity0 and top city officials at a @entity17 news conference			2
" this landmark consent decree is the most comprehensive agreement the @entity32 has ever entered into with a police department , " @entity31 said , " and it will serve as a blueprint for reform for departments across the country			1
" @entity17 cops convicted in post-katrina shootings case if , as expected , a federal judge approves the agreement , it will mark a dramatic day in the police department 's history			0
a @entity9 investigation in the 1990s resulted in a temporary improvement in police conduct , but officials say there was no court - backed consent decree with tough requirements , and the @entity3 slipped back into its old ways of doing things			1
officials said they expect the agreement will stick because of the wide - ranging , detailed requirements including a minimum of four years of federal and court monitoring			1
the sweeping agreement requires detailed documentation of cases in which police use force , and a review of each case by officials in the police department 's @entity74			0
even traffic stops are dealt with in the agreement because of complaints of inappropriate police conduct , and racial profiling			0
officials also said the agreement makes an important change by requiring the videotaping of suspect interviews to ensure there are no longer threats to harm the suspect or his family			0
payment for off - duty security work , which had been a source of department corruption , will be limited and carefully scrutinized			2
one of the most egregious examples of police misconduct stemmed from a fatal shooting at the city 's @entity96 in the immediate aftermath of @entity99 in 2005			0
four police officers shot and killed two people and wounded four others in the incident , but only in the past year did a federal court exact punishment on the officers			1
other police departments , including those in @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 , also have agreed to consent decrees with the @entity9 for controversial policies and patterns of alleged misconduct			2
but officials familiar with the cases say they do not compare with the heavy requirements being placed on the @entity3			2
mayor @entity119 has been fully supportive of federal efforts to clean up the department			0
the federal investigation was launched shortly after @entity119 took office in 2010			0
the probe led to findings in march 2011 that the department was riddled with corruption and suffered from management dysfunction			0
details on how to address the many problems have been hammered out behind closed doors the past several months			0
