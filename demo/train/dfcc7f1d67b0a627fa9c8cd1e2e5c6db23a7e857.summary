@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's been described as the solution to a problem nobody realized existed			1
but that has n't stopped the humble @entity7 from becoming a ubiquitous fixture of stationery cupboards worldwide , with manufacturers @entity10 producing 50 billion each year			1
the sticky yellow squares did not always look destined to set the office supply world alight			0
in fact , it took 12 years from when the technology behind the product was first developed , to post-its hitting the market			1
the story of the post-it -- the self - attaching note that adheres in such a way that it can be removed without causing damage -- begins in 1968			0
@entity25 , a chemist for the giant multinational @entity26 company @entity10 , was attempting to develop a better adhesive			2
" it was part of my job as a researcher to develop new adhesives , and at that time we wanted to develop bigger , stronger , tougher adhesives , " he said			0
" this was none of those			0
" what he came up with were microspheres , which retained their stickiness and had a " removability characteristic , " allowing attached surfaces to be peeled apart easily			0
for years he struggled to find a use for his invention , preaching the merits of his creation to unreceptive colleagues			0
" i got to be known as ' mr @entity48 , ' because i would n't give up , " he said			0

@entity55 had been in church for choir practice , grappling with a regularly occurring problem with his hymnbook , when he had his " eureka moment " -- " the one where you get the adrenaline rush , " he says -- regarding the way @entity25 's microspheres could potentially help			1
during his wednesday night choir practice , @entity55 would bookmark his hymnbook with pieces of paper -- but by sunday morning they would have fallen out			2
" i thought what i need is a bookmark that would stick to the paper without falling off and but not damage the sheets , " he said			0
when the team started writing messages on the notes to communicate around the office , they realized the full potential of the idea			1
" i thought what we have here is n't just a bookmark , " said @entity55			2
" it 's a whole new way to communicate			0
" not everyone saw the value in the idea , says @entity55 , but the team continued to lobby for their idea and eventually in 1980 , after extensive market testing , @entity10 released the product on to the market			1
from that point , the post-it was unstoppable			0

it spread " like a virus , " said @entity55			1
" it was always a self -- advertising product , " he said , because customers would put the notes on documents they sent to others , arousing the recipient 's curiosity			1
" they would look at it , peel it off and play with it and then go out and buy a pad for themselves			0
" @entity25 says that like many winning innovations , the post-it was a product nobody thought they needed until they did			2
" it 's like having a cell phone with a camera on it , " he said			0
" who would have thought that would have been useful for anything but you ca n't buy one these days without a camera or music on it			0
" the make - up of the post-it 's adhesive strips remain a closely guarded secret , protected by the patents on microspheres			2
" because we did n't patent it , we did n't have to tell people how we make it , " said @entity55 , whose car license plate reads " @entity7 "			1
" this is a product that looks so simple but is very high tech. " people wrongly assume the co-inventors of the post-it must be extremely wealthy , he said , but they have had great careers out of the invention , and he now enjoys a " comfortable retirement			2
" the real satisfaction though , says @entity25 , is seeing a product they created embed itself in the culture -- featured in films , office mosaic pop - art and the daily lives of millions			0
" you see these computers ( in movies ) that are just festooned with post-it notes , " he says			1
" the fact that the post-it notes just exploded as a product is more than i could ever hope for			1

more than 50 billion of @entity10 's post-it notes are sold every year
hit product reached market 12 years after it was invented
@entity10 *employee* , @entity55 realized potential of @entity7 in church
once the product was released in 1980 , it spread " like a virus , " he recalls
