-- a federal judge on friday denied a stay of execution for a @entity5 man who raped and murdered a 15 - year - old , but gave him a choice of whether to die by single injection or the state 's recently revised three - drug method			1
if the execution proceeds as scheduled on wednesday , @entity11 could become the first person to be executed in @entity5 since 2006 , when legal challenges arose prompting the state to revise its lethal injection procedure			1
he could also become the first inmate to be put to death in @entity5 's new lethal injection chamber , which was modified to meet requirements to come out of the review			1
if , however , @entity11 elects to be executed by a single injection of sodium thiopental and the state refuses , a stay of his execution will be ordered , @entity23 district judge @entity22 wrote in a decision issued today			1
read the judge 's ruling ( @entity32 ) @entity22 noted that present litigation had nothing to do with " the wisdom or morality of the death penalty " but rather , the narrow issue of whether the 56 - year - old was entitled to a stay of execution			1
" the passions that surround these issues are deep and entirely understandable , but they have little to do with the limited legal question presented here , " he wrote			0
" the court is painfully aware that however it decides a case of this nature , there will be many who disagree profoundly with its decision			0
the moral and political debate about capital punishment will continue , as it should			0
" @entity11 was sentenced to death in 1982 for the rape and murder of @entity60 , who was walking to @entity61 in @entity62 when @entity11 pulled her into an orange grove , according to court documents			1
he raped and strangled her with her own shoelace and took her school identification cards and books			0
later that evening , he looked up her family in the phone book and called their home , the documents state			0
" @entity75 , mrs. @entity60 , @entity76 is n't home from school yet , is she ? " court documents quoted him as saying			2
" you will never see your daughter again			0
you can find her body on the corner of @entity84 and @entity85			0
" he also placed a call to police directing them to her body			0
during the investigation , three witnesses identified @entity11 as being near the scene of the crime			2
police also found @entity60 's school books and newspaper articles about her death in @entity11 's home , and clothing with semen stains in @entity11 's work locker			1
during the penalty phase of @entity11 's trial , his lawyer presented psychiatric evidence suggesting that he had emotional problems , including sexual maladjustment and dysfunction and claimed he was remorseful			1
the jury deliberated for three hours before returning a death verdict , according to an opinion issued september 19 by the @entity113			0
@entity11 had exhausted all his state and federal appeals and habeas corpus issues , according to the @entity117 , when he petitioned the court last week to join the case that led to an overhaul of the state 's execution procedures , which took effect august 29			1
among the changes , according to the @entity124 : the revised three - drug method , which includes new directives on how to prepare and administer the mixture ; a new selection process and training program for members of the " lethal injection team , " which consists of groups including the security sub-team , the intravenous sub-team and the infusion sub-team			1
the state also built a new execution facility at @entity138 , home of @entity5 's male death row , with a bigger death chamber and observation room that separates guests of the condemned inmate from witnesses related to the victim			2
@entity11 argued that , until the court had an opportunity to conduct a full review of the regulations , no executions should proceed , according to @entity22 's opinion			1
lawyers for the state argued that the defense failed to show the new regulations created " a demonstrated risk of severe pain , " as required by the most recent @entity23 @entity158 decision to test lethal injection protocol , @entity159			2
they also argued that the regulations had come about after years of review and public hearings , and in direct response to issues raised by the @entity158 , and expressed concerns over deviating from them			2
@entity22 wrote that allowing the condemned inmate to choose which injection protocol to use would address that concern			0
" allowing a condemned inmate to make such a choice is consistent with @entity113 authority in cases arising both in @entity5 and elsewhere , " he wrote			0
@entity5 's last execution was on january 17 , 2006 , when @entity173 was put to death for three counts of first - degree murder with special circumstances			2
from behind bars , he had helped orchestrate a deadly armed robbery at a convenience store .			0

if it proceeds , @entity11 's execution will be first since lethal injection review
federal judge gives @entity11 choice between single injection or three - drug injection
@entity11 was sentenced to death in 1982 for rape , murder of 15 - year - old @entity60
execution will be first in lethal injection chamber *designed* to meet new regulations
