the sun is not yet up over the desert , but already 50 horses and riders are gathered at @entity5 's @entity4 in @entity6 , half an hour 's drive from the capital @entity9			1
they are gathered to compete in a 120 - kilometer ( 74.5 - mile ) endurance race , the likes of which are held here most weeks			1
masked riders gaze steely - eyed into the desert as their horses crest their necks and paw the ground , eager to get the race under way			1
the starter counts down in @entity20 , and the horses and riders surge over the starting line , galloping into the pitch - black desert with their high - held tails streaming behind them			1
hot on their heels a fleet of @entity30 hares after them across the sand , the glare of their headlights creating a moving oasis of light			0
these are the support vehicles from which the owners , trainers and managers can observe the race in progress and shout instructions			0
today , the horses will complete laps of a 30 km ( 18.6 miles ) course , stopping for checks at the end of each lap. any horse deemed unfit to continue the race will be eliminated at each check point			1
they will travel at speeds of up to 40 km per hour ( 25 mph ) for around eight hours			0
of the 50 who started the race , fewer than a quarter will complete it			1
most of the horses are pure - breed @entity60 who are revered in @entity62 culture , prized for their beauty , intelligence and , above all , their endurance			1
it was the @entity67 horse that formed the genetic blueprint for the modern racehorse , with every modern thoroughbred tracing its dna to just three " original " oriental stallions imported to the @entity73 in the 18th century			0
some say the @entity67 horse was a gift to mankind from @entity75			0
the ancient breed is supremely well - adapted to the unforgiving desert terrain of the @entity78			1
many of these animals are ex-racehorses , gradually trained and brought up to fitness to compete in endurance races			0
although the sport is ancient in its origins , today 's races are as professional as they are competitive , with horses conditioned to the peak of fitness and subject to rigorous veterinary inspections both during and after the race			1
at each stage 's completion , the horses are doused with water and their heart rates measured			1
a team of veterinarians inspects each horse thoroughly before it is allowed to continue the race			0
the number of competitors is gradually whittled down until only the very fittest are left to contest the final laps			2
@entity105 is taken seriously in this part of the world : many of the horses are owned by members of the @entity5 and @entity112 families			1
one such owner is @entity114 , ruler of @entity112			0
his son @entity115 is a champion endurance rider in his own right who is competing here today			2
" i 've been riding since i was 11 years old and doing endurance since 2006 , " he said during an inspection			0
" some people in my family are more into flat racing ( his father owns one of the most important thoroughbred racing operations in the world ) , some are more into endurance racing			2
i actually started with polo but then i was attracted by endurance and i loved it			0
hopefully i will be doing it for the rest of my life			0
" unfortunately for @entity115 , he and his striking grey horse are eliminated after the penultimate lap. but is it one of his compatriots from @entity112 who claims first place in a sprint finish with another rider			2
they are among only a handful of riders to complete the grueling course			1
the enduring appeal of such a sport is easy to understand ; physically and strategically demanding , it is also an expression of the extreme respect with which horses -- particularly @entity67 ones -- are treated in this part of the world			2
@entity155 were told that if they treated these precious horses with love and respect , they would be handsomely rewarded , both in their earthly life and beyond			2
while the winning rider accepts this congratulations from the crowd , his horse -- a magnificent chestnut with the dish - shaped face and high tail carriage characteristic of the breed -- is handed to a team of grooms to be looked after			0
with a last look back over his shoulder as he is led away , the horse flares his nostrils and whinnies , a final call to the desert from whence he came .			0

the ancient *tradition* of desert racing continues in the @entity182
the 50 horses and riders set off , completing laps of the 30 - kilometer course
the horses are given thorough medical checks after each lap to ensure they are *healthy*
only a handful of the horses competing make it to the finish line in @entity5
