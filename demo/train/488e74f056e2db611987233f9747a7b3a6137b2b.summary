how quickly it 's all over			1
and yet , already , begun again			0
this sunday 's " @entity7 " marks the end of yet another season and we tried for a soft landing in @entity6			1
i 'd like to thank veteran field producer , @entity9 ( hopefully you follow his exploits on @entity12 ) , for heroically volunteering the use of his mighty buttocks for our carefully crafted @entity16 - inspired cold open			0
i sent him and the crew to @entity19 with every intention of depicting the place as a blight on paradise , but the boys apparently had a wonderful time			1
i stayed behind that day , lounging about @entity26 , @entity28 's former sanctum sanctorum , where he wrote all the @entity16 novels , getting familiar with the feeling of owning a grotto and drinking many excellent rum punches			1
thanks also to @entity33 , owner of @entity26 , creator of @entity34 , legendary mentor to @entity36			0
man with a plan and a vision			0
the show concerns itself , among other things , with who " owns " paradise			1
increasingly , everywhere -- whether @entity46 , @entity47 , the @entity48 or @entity6 -- people who grow up adjacent to water , to idyllic views , lovely beaches , traditional architecture , can no longer afford to live there			1
their homes , their neighborhoods are , in the modern economy , the harsh reality of present day , " undervalued			2
" traditional ways of life , like fishing , seem quaint anachronisms when the simple fact is that you can make a lot more money carrying a golf bag for a tourist , or making blender drinks at @entity19			0
is that a bad thing ? so many places i look -- even in @entity75 , we see a transition to a service economy			1
like the @entity6 fishermen we talked to , moving away from the things we once did			1
we are increasingly a nation in the business ( in someone else 's words ) of " selling each other cheeseburgers			2
" are there any bad guys in this equation ? i do n't know			0
@entity6 has a harsh past and an uncomfortable present			1
in spite of its spectacular and captivating beauty , it is a place that 's easy to romanticize			2
but one should n't , i think , do that			0
like a lot of our shows , we come to no neat conclusions			0
only more questions -- which is , i suppose , conclusion enough			0
we are already well underway shooting another season			2
hope you liked this one			0
