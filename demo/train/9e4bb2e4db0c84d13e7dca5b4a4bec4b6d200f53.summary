-- prince @entity1 went back to school this week			1
to @entity6 , to be precise , where he will undertake a tailor - made , 10 - week course in agricultural management			1
when he completes the course , new father @entity1 wo n't have earned a degree ; he wo n't walk out with a doctorate or a masters ; in fact he wo n't receive any formal qualifications at all , but he will have gained a beginner 's knowledge of how to manage the @entity15 -- a vast Â £ 760 million ( about $ 1.25 billion ) entity established in 1337 to provide a private income for use by the reigning monarch 's eldest son , which @entity1 will inherit when prince @entity21 becomes @entity22			1
as with most matters relating to the monarchy his enrollment has had a polarizing effect : the news was met with staunch criticism amid a smattering of praise , with some university students declaring he 'd been given a " free pass " because of his royal status			1
others went so far as to describe his admittance as an " insult " to those already studying at @entity6			1
not surprisingly , people have been quick to jump on the critical band wagon without taking a moment to actually understand exactly what it is he 's doing at the university			0
but since when has receiving further education of any description been something negative ? the type of course @entity1 is undertaking is open to pretty much anyone who has the money to pay for it -- land owners , company executives , the posh set			1
is it an elitist course ? perhaps			0
but who could argue that @entity1 does not hold an elite position ? entry for this particular program is not reliant on past grades or previous academic records			1
professor @entity63 of @entity6 's @entity64 told the @entity65 : " whether they have any a-levels at all is no more relevant than the price of tea in @entity70			1
" @entity1 's course was organized by the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) , whose patron is the @entity74 , himself a former @entity6 graduate			1
@entity21 has been clear regarding his concerns for the welfare of @entity79 's countryside , and it would appear @entity1 is keen to educate himself and continue his father 's mission			1
surely it is better that he learn how to do it properly of his own initiative than screw it up down the line because his a-level results did n't live up to the @entity6 ideal			1
it 's no secret that @entity1 would like to delay leading a full royal life for as long as possible			1
that may be hard to comprehend for those slogging away to make ends meet on the minimum wage , but perhaps understandable given that there is no retirement age in a job that calls for a lifetime of service to crown and country			0
rather than attending lectures and seminars and writing essays on economics and land economy , i expect @entity1 would rather bolt to @entity107 with the @entity108 in the coming weeks for what has become something of a traditional winter break -- as would many of the hoi polloi , no doubt			1
but having completed service in all three branches of the @entity79 military , performed his first investiture on behalf of the @entity118 , and represented the @entity118 for the first time at a state visit , @entity1 is now preparing more extensively for the role he will one day fulfill			2
his royal engagements have been stepped up , and he and the @entity123 will undertake a tour to @entity125 and @entity126 in april			0
furthering his education is the natural next step			0
personally i would rather see @entity1 fork over private funds in preparation for his future role than squander said funds on @entity135 cocktails at @entity136 , the royals ' perennial favorite nightclub			2
wherever there are fortunes and family firms , there are heirs to fortunes and family firms			0
the children of both @entity146 and @entity147 have joined their respective family businesses and done exceptionally well			0
why ? because they learned their trade beforehand			0
others have enjoyed all the benefits of wealth and a globally - recognized family name only to stumble out of nightclubs and make sex tapes			0
surely it can only be a good thing that @entity1 has gone back to school			2
his course is being paid for privately , not through the public purse			0
he 's putting in the work , and ultimately the @entity79 countryside stands to benefit from what he learns			0
i imagine @entity166 would have been mighty chuffed to have a second heir to the throne walking its hallowed halls			0
the city of @entity6 is certain to enjoy a rise in tourism due to its famous pupil			2
interest in the university itself will increase , and perhaps inquiries about higher education in general will spike			0
to me , it seems perfectly fitting that the @entity181 actually attend @entity6			2
he could have hightailed it to @entity6 , @entity184 , of course -- but then people really would be up in arms			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			0

prince @entity1 began an agricultural management course at @entity6
