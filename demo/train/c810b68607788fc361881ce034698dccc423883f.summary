-- president @entity1 reacted with fury when major legislative pillars of his @entity4 were declared unconstitutional by a @entity5 anchored by four ideological conservatives			1
he lashed out at the justices , accusing them of practicing crass politics disguised as constitutional law			2
seventy - five years ago last month , @entity1 proposed his ill - fated court - packing plan that would have allowed him to stack the court with new appointees sympathetic to the @entity4			1
will history be repeated this term when the @entity16 court decides the constitutional fate of president @entity19 's signature legislation , the @entity18 ? the justices will hear five - and - a - half hours of arguments over three days , march 26 - 28 , on the healthcare law and deliver their judgment by the end of the term			1
if the court strikes down all or part of the law , @entity19 , like @entity1 before him , will almost certainly denounce the court 's decision			1
after all , he has already had practice in publicly criticizing the court			0
at his 2010 @entity34 , with the justices sitting directly in front of him , he accused the court majority in the @entity39 decision of reversing a century of constitutional law to open " the floodgates for special interests ... to spend without limit in our elections			2
" besides the willingness of both @entity1 and @entity19 to criticize the court , there are other parallels between the two @entity51 presidents			1
both came to office as liberal reformers who envisioned a large role for the federal government in promoting the nation 's welfare			0
but in defending their policies , they revealed their very different political styles and temperaments			0
during his first term , @entity1 , a supremely confident , aggressive politician , proudly brandished his liberalism as a blunt instrument against his sworn conservative enemies in the business community , whom he labeled " economic royalists			2
" for most of @entity19 's first term , the cool , controlled president has downplayed his liberalism , seeking to bring conservative lawmakers to the bargaining table , without notable success			1
only in the past few months has he been willing to aggressively confront his political opponents			0
there also are notable parallels between the two chief justices , @entity78 and @entity16 , separated by 75 years of @entity80 history			0
both were brilliant lawyers appointed to the court by @entity84 presidents			0
and both inherited formidable conservative blocs of justices whose judicial opinions demonstrated a hostility to the policies of the @entity51 presidents in office			0
in the 1930s , the four most conservative members of the court , known as " the four horsemen , " consistently voted to strike down far - reaching @entity4 economic legislation			0
the @entity16 court 's most conservative justices , @entity100 , @entity101 , and @entity102 , all appointed by @entity84 presidents , have voted together on polarizing issues ( such as campaign financing in @entity39 ) in favor of corporate interests			2
the conspicuous differences between @entity1 and @entity19 are matched by the leaders of the two courts , chief justices @entity78 and @entity16			1
neither @entity16 nor , perhaps , anyone else who has served on the modern court , could rival @entity78 in the breadth of his career			0
@entity78 was appointed chief justice by president @entity117 in 1930 after a distinguished career as a lawyer , investigator of special interests , reform governor of @entity122 , @entity5 justice and secretary of state			1
his only failure in public life was his narrow defeat as the @entity84 candidate for president in 1916 by the incumbent , @entity130			0
more significantly , @entity78 , unlike @entity16 , could not be easily categorized by the interests he advocated			0
as a lawyer , he defended large corporate interests but also five socialists who had been expelled from the @entity136 because of their political convictions			0
as chief justice , @entity78 was a centrist , often appearing to split the difference between the two warring conservative and liberal factions on the court			0
he wrote opinions upholding some @entity4 statutes , but also voted with the majority to strike down the @entity145 and the @entity146			0
at the same time , @entity78 burnished his longstanding reputation as a stalwart civil libertarian , writing groundbreaking opinions protecting freedom of the press and association			0
in contrast , @entity16 earned a reputation as a fierce advocate on behalf of conservative causes before his appointment to the court by president @entity158 in 2005			2
and as chief justice , he has aligned himself consistently with the most conservative members of the court			0
the balance of power on the @entity16 court in closely divided constitutional cases has not resided with the chief justice , as it did with the @entity78 court 's centrists , the chief justice and justice @entity169			1
instead , the pivotal vote has usually been cast by justice @entity171 , who often , but not always , sides with his more ideologically conservative brethren			0
if the justices divide along conservative - liberal lines on the constitutionality of the federal healthcare law , @entity171 , not @entity16 , will likely determine the outcome			1
@entity19 's recent boldness in confronting his @entity84 opponents , as @entity1 routinely did throughout his presidency , suggests that he , like @entity1 , will attack the @entity16 court if it throws out his major policy initiative , the @entity18			1
but however aggressive his attack , he is not likely to emulate @entity1 in proposing a court - packing plan to add justices more to his liking			1
most historians have rated @entity1 's court - packing plan as one of the worst mistakes of his presidency , a judgment that will not be lost on @entity19 , a careful student of @entity80 history			1
even if the justices uphold the healthcare statute , the @entity16 court may well be a central issue in the fall presidential campaign			2
both @entity19 and his potential @entity84 opponents have said that the 2012 presidential election will be about the future direction of the country			1
the @entity80 @entity5 will play a prominent role in that future			2
the victor in the november presidential election may have the opportunity to appoint one or more justices to the @entity5 ( four justices are older than 70 )			1
if there are vacancies during the next presidential term , the president 's appointments are likely to determine the future direction of the court and of the nation			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			2

@entity5 will hear case on @entity19 's healthcare law this month
@entity224 : case *recalls* the furious *battle* between @entity1 and the court
in both cases , president 's prime *achievements* came under judicial review
@entity219 : @entity5 's future direction could be decided by november election
