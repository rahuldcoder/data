" we are determined to prevent @entity1 from acquiring nuclear weapons			1
" so said president @entity3 on friday at the annual general assembly of the @entity5			2
as presidential sentences go , it 's an artfully constructed one			0
it 's not a statement about @entity1			1
it 's not a statement about nuclear weapons			2
it 's a statement about the president 's feelings			0
as such , the statement arrives with a built - in loophole			0
" ( @entity19 ) e have imposed the most comprehensive , the hardest - hitting sanctions that the @entity1 regime has ever faced			1
" that sentence , from the same speech , is likewise literally true			0
the president has somewhat tightened the sanctions already in place when he entered office			0
so yes , the sanctions now in place are the " hardest - hitting " the regime " has ever faced			0
" on the other hand , despite the tightening , the sanctions remain pitifully inadequate to the job			0
@entity1 's most crucial import is gasoline , because this oil - producing nation can not refine enough gasoline for its automobiles			1
gasoline imports to @entity1 are supposedly sanctioned			2
despite sanctions , @entity1 has increased its imports of gasoline over the past 90 days , according to news reports			1
as sanctions fail to bait , the options on halting @entity1 's nuclear program get uglier			1
somebody ( @entity50 ? @entity1 dissidents backed by @entity49 ? ) is carrying out a campaign of violent sabotage against @entity1 's nuclear program			1
on november 12 , a huge explosion leveled an @entity1 missile base near @entity55			2
@entity1 acknowledged the explosion killed several dozen people , including the head of its missile program			1
by some reports , the dead included a team of visiting @entity63 missile scientists			0
two weeks later , another huge explosion was heard near @entity65 , site of an @entity1 uranium enrichment facility			2
this time , however , the @entity1 regime offered no statement or details on the explosion			0
if any @entity73 government knows anything , that government is not sharing its information			0
over the past few years , there have been numerous reports of the assassination of @entity1 nuclear scientists , including one shot dead on a busy street by a motorcyclist in july			1
some foreign policy analysts suggest a policy of " containment " and " deterrence " of @entity1 's nuclear weapons			1
that policy seems incredibly unrealistic , given the @entity1 regime 's long history of reckless adventurism , including terrorist operations on the soil of ( among others ) : @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity50 , @entity49 , @entity100 , the @entity101 and the @entity102			2
but even if containment and deterrence were realistic options , the situation has moved far past that point			0
there 's a covert war being waged apparently over the @entity1 nuclear program			1
@entity1 is waging a brutal irregular campaign of its own : it 's suspected of being behind an assassination attempt against the @entity49 ambassador to the @entity102 ; it has given aid to @entity117 's @entity116 and to @entity118 in @entity98 and has aided insurgents in @entity120			2
and @entity1 's nuclear ambitions have unleashed a cycle that will not be stable -- that is much more likely to end in open conflict than in a standoff			1
yet there is a leader pushing a plan that could end the cycle without war : @entity102 sen. @entity131 , @entity132			2
for a year , the freshman senator has been urging a new approach to sanctions , an approach that truly would force an @entity1 rethink			2
the @entity131 plan , co-sponsored by @entity139 , @entity140 , would impose sanctions on the @entity1 central bank , in effect severing @entity1 from the entire global payments system			1
specifically , the @entity146 amendment would forbid any @entity102 financial institution to deal with the @entity1 central bank -- or to deal with any financial institution that does so			1
every bank would find itself confronted with a stark threat : if you do business with @entity1 , you will lose access to the largest financial market on earth			2
these sanctions would collapse the central bank of @entity1 and shove the @entity1 economy onto a barter system for all external transactions			1
the @entity146 amendment passed the @entity161 100 - 0 as an amendment to the @entity163			0
on friday , it passed the @entity165 and will now head to the president 's desk for his signature			0
the @entity3 administration has opposed @entity170 for fear of roiling world oil markets			0
@entity1 exports 2.5 million barrels per day			0
to put that figure in perspective , the @entity174 from @entity175 ( a decision on which the @entity3 administration has just postponed ) could have added 700,000 barrels per day to world exports , alone substituting for almost one - third of @entity1 exports			1
@entity183 and @entity99 have capacity to increase their production quickly and substantially , and of course the @entity102 government has 727 million barrels in the strategic petroleum reserve , more than ample to deal with supply shocks			0
still , to respond to administration concerns , the @entity146 amendment now empowers the president to issue waivers on both national security and economic grounds			0
most observers expect the president to sign the @entity163 legislation with the @entity146 amendment -- and then seek to evade the amendment 's requirements			1
he will certainly have the authority to do so			0
this evasion will however come at a political price			0
the central bank sanctions in @entity146 begin to bite hard six months out --- i.e. , about the time of the @entity206 and @entity207 conventions			1
if the president is then granting waivers to banks that want to do business with @entity1 , that action will be visible and politically costly			0
the utmost irony here is that detractors in the administration and in the foreign policy establishment criticize @entity146 as a form of confrontation with @entity1			1
in reality , @entity146 is the last and best chance for regional peace : the last best hope to avoid the horrible choice of either using force to stop @entity1 -- or acquiescing as @entity1 gains the power to wage nuclear terror against its neighbors and the world .			1

@entity231 : @entity3 talks of *commitment* to @entity1 sanctions , but they are not strong enough
he says " covert war " over @entity1 's nuclear program more likely to end in conflict than in standoff
@entity242 : plan for sanctions on @entity1 central bank would sever @entity1 from global payments system
@entity242 : @entity3 should support @entity146 plan -- best and last chance for regional peace
