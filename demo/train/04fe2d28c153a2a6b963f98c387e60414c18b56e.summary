-- for years , the @entity1 has been pursuing a workable ray gun that could provide a leap ahead in ship self - defenses			1
now , with a series of tests of a system called the @entity9 , or @entity10 ) , it may be one step closer to that goal			1
@entity13 ( @entity13 ) , the service 's technology development arm , announced today that @entity10 had " successfully tracked , engaged , and destroyed " a drone in flight , during an over-the - water engagement at @entity19 , @entity20			1
it 's certainly not the first time lasers have shot down an unmanned aerial vehicle -- last year , the @entity24 zapped several drones with beam weapons in a series of tests at @entity29 , @entity20 , -- but this test brings an additional bit of realism -- and an extra technical challenge			0
laser beams can lose strength as they move through the moist , salty sea atmosphere above the sea , so the @entity1 needs directed - energy weapons that can work effectively on ships			1
the @entity10 is essentially a laser upgrade to the @entity41 ( @entity42 ) , a.k.a. the @entity44 gun , a radar - guided autocannon that is already installed on @entity1 surface combatants			1
according to @entity13 , the system tested ( shown here ) fired a laser through a beam director installed on a tracking mount , which in turn was controlled by a @entity53			0
that 's the basically same system that controls the @entity44			0
it represents a possible next step for the @entity44 system , which is currently limited by the range of its 20mm autocannon ( @entity61 , manufacturer of the @entity44 , is also marketing a missile system to replace the gun )			2
the @entity44 is a last line of defense against sea - skimming anti-ship missiles and hostile aircraft , but the laser would n't replace the gun completely			0
theoretically , directed energy weapons would increase the range of the system , but you would still have the gun as a backup if the laser fails to do the job			0
@entity10 might also have other applications : land - based @entity44 guns have been used to shoot down incoming rockets and mortars in @entity81 and @entity82 , and a laser @entity44 could -- theoretically -- avoid the problem of the " 20mm shower " ( unexploded rounds falling back to earth )			2
