-- if this is one of the perks of being a crooked stockbroker , then perhaps it 's not such a bad career choice after all -- just ask @entity6			2
@entity10 flute in one hand , lobster in the other , the @entity8 actor was the picture of outrageous excess when he played the lead role in @entity17 's " @entity16			1
" and the jewel in his corrupt crown ? a 45 - meter superyacht called @entity21			2
but the high life is n't just for the cinema screen			0
in fact , you could be sailing the seas on the very same boat that appeared in the @entity29 - nominated film -- if you can stump up $ 125,000 a week to charter her			1
featuring a hot tub , cocktail bar and enough bedrooms to accommodate 10 guests , the lavish vessel -- called @entity37 -- was used to depict the real - life yacht owned by infamous stockbroker @entity39			2
in the real world , @entity21 sank in 1997 after @entity39 ordered the captain to sail her into a storm off the coast of @entity45 , while supposedly high on drugs			2
but if you want to retrace @entity6 's ostentatious footsteps -- without the near - death experience -- you can now charter the yacht , which will tour the @entity51 from april			1
@entity52 struck why would someone fork out hundreds of thousands of dollars to rent such a vessel ? " i imagine it 's much like being in the presence of the actual movie star -- you will get to sit where they did , walk where they did , maybe even look at memorabilia if the crew were allowed to take pictures , " says @entity55 , editor of search site @entity56 , which features @entity37 and other film boats			1
" it adds something extra special to that charter			0
i guess it 's similar to how restaurants that are frequented by a-listers are always very popular with us mere mortals			0
" from @entity77 to @entity78 of course , @entity37 is n't the only big - screen vessel available for hire			1
fancy cruising the high seas like @entity82 on a mission to save the world ? elegant 56 - meter @entity85 -- which @entity77 sailed in 2012 film " @entity86 " -- could be yours for a mere $ 96,000 a week			1
then there 's @entity89 , the 52 - meter yacht on which @entity78 performed a tabletop striptease for @entity93 in the 1996 film aptly titled " striptease			1
" what goes on in @entity89 , stays on @entity89 , particularly if you 're paying $ 165,000 per week to charter it			1
an african queen if you 're looking for a big - screen boat , without the big price , then look no further than the @entity100			1
the rickety steamboat ferried film legends @entity105 and @entity106 down the @entity107 in the 1951 classic , " @entity100			1
" the ramshackle eight - meter wooden vessel was saved from the scrapyard almost a decade ago , and now attracts film buffs from across the @entity111 for joy trips at the more reasonable price of $ 49			1
" people will drive eight hours to get here , just to ride her			0
they 'll go out in rain , thunderstorms			0
they 're just so desperate to go on - board , " says co-owner @entity119 , who runs river cruises in @entity121 , @entity122			0
" a lot of people say it was the first movie they ever saw in theaters , so the boat means a lot , to a lot of people			0
i think she 's as much a star of the film as @entity106 was			1
" lights , camera , action but before a yacht even graces the big screen , it needs a dedicated team of cameramen to brave the elements			0
for @entity147 creative director @entity146 , that often means hanging out of a helicopter to get the perfect shot			0
" to get the best aerial shots you need a good pilot , it 's very important			0
the more they understand the shot i 'm after and know how to maneuver the helicopter , that really helps , " he says			0
" there are not many restrictions , other than your imagination			0
" and much like the " @entity16 , " it seems the only restriction to living out your cinematic sailing dream is how much you 're willing to pay			2
