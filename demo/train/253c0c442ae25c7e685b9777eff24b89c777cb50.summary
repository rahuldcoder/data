at a coming - out party for its upcoming @entity3 console , @entity0 leveled its guns at rival @entity7 's @entity6 device and fired until the chambers were empty			1
during a press event monday night at the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity0 hammered home key points about its new gaming system : sharing games will be free			1
if people want to sell used games , that 's fine			2
and a near - constant internet connection , meant to monitor game usage , wo n't be required			0
in other words , the @entity3 will do many things the new xbox apparently can not			2
oh , and the @entity3 will sell for $ 399 -- $ 100 less than the @entity6			1
both consoles are expected this fall in time for the holiday shopping season , setting up a battle for the hearts , minds and wallets of the gaming community			2
a big point of contention among gamers is that @entity7 's new @entity6 will require an online check - in every 24 hours ( less than the " always - on " mode gamers expected ) and will only allow games to be resold at selected retailers			1
games may be shared only among a limited number of friends and family members			0
@entity7 's daily check - in is designed , in part , to make sure users have n't resold , traded in or given away a game they 've already downloaded on their consoles			1
the idea is to prevent more than one person from effectively owning a game that was purchased only once			0
after rolling out a list of new games , @entity49 , president and ceo of @entity51 , essentially went down a laundry list of complaints about the new xbox , which had been showcased earlier monday , and promised the opposite			0
" in addition to creating an amazing library of new titles on @entity3 , we 're equally focused on delivering what gamers want most without imposing restrictions or devaluing their @entity3 purchases , " @entity49 said			1
" for instance , @entity3 wo n't impose any new restrictions on the use of pre-owned games			1
" that announcement got a loud and sustained round of applause from an @entity11 crowd not always easy to impress			1
" i guess that 's a good thing , " a smiling @entity49 replied			0
in game - console terms , digital - rights management is a code that allows users to access a game 's content			1
it 's designed to assure developers and publishers that only the person who paid for the game , and close family and friends , can play it			0
@entity0 and @entity7 are n't the ones that would benefit from @entity90 , or used - game restrictions			1
game publishers want to make sure they are getting paid for their work , and that includes the secondhand market			0
in the weeks leading up to @entity11 , @entity7 had sought to calm gamers ' concerns with a series of blog posts that some felt nibbled around the edges of rights - management issues but never offered definitive answers			1
@entity0 then was conspicuously quiet in what , now , appears to have been an orchestrated effort to lower the boom at @entity11			2
witness the " @entity108 " released shortly after the presentation			0
it 's 22 seconds long and features only " @entity111 , " a man handing a disc to another man			0
that cheeky video had racked up more than 1.5 million views on @entity117 in less than 24 hours			0
@entity7 did not immediately respond tuesday to a request seeking comment			0
but online pundits were quick to praise @entity0 for landing some blows against its rival			0
" as crude as it is to declare a company the ' winner ' of @entity11 , it 's hard to see @entity0 's presentation today as anything but a pr coup ... , " @entity123 , senior gaming editor at @entity126 content partner @entity124 , wrote monday			1
" among some of the most influential and hardest - to - please gamers on the @entity137 , @entity0 is now the savior company that can do no wrong			2
they should enjoy the ride , which will last just as long as it takes for them to do something wrong			0
" writing for @entity144 , @entity143 takes a longer view			0
@entity0 's move is meant to preserve the future of disc - based games , at least for now , while @entity7 stands ready to kill discs entirely , moving to an almost entirely digital model , he said			1
playing to what 's already comfortable for gamers was clearly part of @entity0 's strategy , @entity143 said			2
" @entity0 is just betting that the good will of gamers will be enough to cut @entity7 's ambitions short , " he wrote			1
" and @entity7 has some big ambitions , not just to be the best game console , but to serve as the central hub of all living room entertainment			0
" it 's a gambit on @entity0 's part , one that 's going to make the console wars even fiercer			2

@entity0 goes for gamers ' hearts with @entity169 announcements
@entity3 will allow sharing , selling used games
announcement draws sustained cheers from gaming crowd at @entity11
@entity7 's @entity6 has digital - rights restrictions
