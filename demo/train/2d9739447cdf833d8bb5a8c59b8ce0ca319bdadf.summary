-- diplomacy and coalition building			2
individuals working for the whole			0
president @entity5 on tuesday stressed that 's how the @entity7 prefers to solve some of the world 's most complicated issues , particularly those in the @entity12 world			1
speaking at the @entity13 , and then at a @entity15 event in @entity16 , @entity5 repeatedly tried to drive home the value of conversation rather than force			1
tuesday began with @entity21 saying it had fired missiles into the @entity24			1
within hours of that claim , @entity5 took the podium at the annual gathering of @entity29 member nations and discussed the threat of @entity21 obtaining a nuclear weapon			1
the five big issues at the @entity13 this week " let me be clear , " the president said			1
" @entity7 wants to resolve this issue through diplomacy , and we believe that there is still time and space to do so			1
" but that time is not unlimited			1
" a nuclear - armed @entity21 " is not a challenge that can be contained , " he said , adding that the scenario would " threaten the elimination of @entity43 , the security of @entity24 nations and the stability of the global economy , " and trigger " a nuclear arms race in the region			1
" the @entity7 " will do what we must to prevent @entity21 from obtaining a nuclear weapon , " @entity5 added , without saying specifically what that meant			1
yet , echoing his 2008 campaign slogan , @entity5 told the @entity13 that he was " hopeful about the world we live in			1
" @entity5 confronts @entity21 , @entity59 at @entity29 @entity5 also offered world leaders details about @entity7 ambassador @entity61 , who was killed this month when a mob overtook the @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65			1
" @entity67 was born in a town called @entity69 , @entity70 , the son of a lawyer and a musician , " he began his speech			0
@entity61 joined the @entity74 and taught @entity75 in @entity76			0
he loved the people of @entity78 and the @entity79 , and spent his life trying to improve their lives			0
@entity61 was like so many foreign service workers who make tremendous personal sacrifices because they 're passionate about building " bridges across oceans and cultures , " @entity5 said			1
" i tell you this story because @entity61 embodied the best of @entity7			1
" that means that the attacks in @entity64 , which also killed three other @entity7 , " were attacks on @entity7			1
" the violence was " an assault on the very ideals upon which the @entity13 was founded , " he added			0
read the full text of @entity5 's remarks once again , @entity5 mentioned diplomacy , saying the attacks offended " the notion that people can resolve their differences peacefully ; that diplomacy can take the place of war ; and that in an interdependent world , all of us have a stake in working towards greater opportunity and security for our citizens			1
" ' deeper causes ' he said he wanted more conversation about " the deeper causes of this crisis			0
" adding more guards at embassies around the world is n't a solution , and neither is banning an @entity124 film that incited the chaos			0
the way forward , the president said , is to make sure everyone understands that @entity7 represents the freedom to say anything and express views that some might find distasteful or offensive			1
" as president of our country , i accept that people are going to call me awful things every day , " he said			2
" and i will always defend their right to do so			0
@entity7 have fought and died around the globe to protect the right of all people to express their views -- even views that we disagree with			2
" the future should be determined by people like @entity61 and not by his killers , @entity5 said			2
time : why @entity64 attack will blind the @entity7 the best way to do that , he said , must be international coalition building			1
@entity5 tried to drive that home not only at the @entity29 but at an afternoon @entity15 event , also in @entity16 , where he spoke about ending human trafficking			1
earlier , he had signed an executive order to stem the crime , which he said victimizes more than 20 million people worldwide			0
" human trafficking ... must be called by its true name : modern slavery , " @entity5 said			1
the order makes it possible to provide more tools and training to federal prosecutors , law enforcement , immigration judges and transportation officials , among others , to identify and assist trafficking victims			0
a $ 6 million awards challenge , supported by @entity172 and @entity173 , to local communities to develop solutions to curb trafficking is also part of the order			0
there will also be several groups trying to formally measure and track human trafficking in the @entity7 so that money can be precisely allocated to combat it			1
@entity5 said human trafficking " distorts markets " and " endangers public health and fuels violence , " he said			1
" this is a no - brainer , " the president said			0
" this is something we should all agree on , " whether one is a @entity194 or @entity195			0
@entity5 spoke directly to trafficked people			2
" in the darkest hours of your lives , you may have felt utterly alone , " he said			0
" @entity199 and optimism that statement echoed a theme running through @entity5 's @entity13 speech : hope			2
despite all of the world 's tragedies and wars and struggle , @entity5 told @entity29 members , he 's optimistic			1
" i am hopeful about the world we live in , " he said			0
he listed a string of reasons			0
the @entity215 war is over			0
he noted that the @entity7 continues to hand over control to locals in @entity221 , and will bring all troops home in 2014			2
" @entity223 has been weakened and @entity224 is no more , " @entity5 said			2
some people have praised the @entity5 administration 's drone strikes that have killed terrorists , though the program remains highly controversial			2
and the @entity231 operation that resulted in the death of the @entity233 represents a major victory during @entity5 's tenure			2
the president reminded listeners that it 's been less than two years since a vendor in @entity240 set himself on fire to protest government corruption , triggering the so - called @entity244			0
" i 've seen hard choices made ... to put more power in the hands of citizens , " he said , pointing out that the @entity7 has supported transitions toward more open societies in the @entity12 world			2
yet a war still rages in one @entity12 nation			0
in the past year and a half , 26,000 people have died in @entity59 , according to groups fighting to oust president @entity257			0
@entity259 's regime has been accused of torturing children , shooting unarmed protesters and going door to door in some villages , killing whole families			0
@entity259 says that terrorists are behind the deaths			0
the regime " must come to an end , so that the suffering of the @entity59 people can stop , " the president said , " and a new dawn can begin			0
" @entity5 : every nation can tackle slavery			2

at @entity29 , @entity5 stressed the need for diplomacy to solve international issues
but he warned , regarding @entity21 , that time for talking " is not unlimited "
@entity5 : @entity7 " will do what we must " to prevent @entity21 from obtaining a nuclear weapon
