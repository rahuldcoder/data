@entity0 -- memories of his own service in @entity5 and the destructive nature of combat are never far from the mind of defense secretary @entity9 , the first former enlisted man to lead the @entity10			1
" every @entity5 veteran understands , " @entity11 told @entity1 's @entity12 during an interview outside his office in the @entity10			1
" any veteran who has ever served in a war understands that , and i think we should never forget the consequences of war			0
" decades after the @entity24 conflict in @entity5 , @entity11 is using the power of his office to help some of the most troubled veterans of that war get the second chance he feels some deserve			1
he is essentially ordering the @entity10 to open the books and allow some veterans of that war with less than honorable discharges to be classified as suffering from post traumatic stress and allow that to be a considered factor in their discharge			1
related : @entity9 reunites with @entity5 platoon commander the move could potentially allow thousands of veterans who did not qualify for disability pay because of their discharge status to finally be compensated			1
for @entity11 , who served as a senior official in the @entity45 during the early years of the @entity47 administration , the time has come to address an issue overshadowing veterans of his war , that has really only come to the forefront recent years			0
" i just really felt , as i always have , that they deserve a little break here lets take another look , " @entity11 said of the policy change			0
" i think a lot of people were treated unfairly because there was no recognition of @entity63			1
" it is a recognition that many feel is long overdue			0
" in our generation , there was the term the ' crazy ' @entity5 vet , " @entity66 , a @entity67 who fought in @entity5 , said recently			1
" you know , guys shooting up gas stations , and robbing stores , and , you know , going off and killing people			0
that was the impression of @entity5 veterans when they came back			1
" @entity66 has spent his career advocating for veterans of that war and trying to shine a light on a mental condition that was not recognized and may have unfairly penalized some of those who came home			0
" it was just seen an as aberration , it was not seen as something that was a natural result of being in combat , and that 's why so many @entity5 vets are so alienated , " @entity66 said			2
with most @entity5 vets now in their sixties and seventies , time is a precious commodity			2
and with high rates of homelessness , depression and suicide among the group , the drumbeat for this recognition has grown louder			2
@entity1 visited a facility in @entity107 , @entity108 taking care of more than 500 homeless veterans , many of them from @entity5 who are still struggling from that long ago war			1
" i used to have nightmares when i came home and pretty much blocked it out of my mind , " said @entity114 , a resident of the facility who was sent to @entity5 when he was 19			2
he is glad the government is looking to do more for some of his buddies			0
" i think it 's great because you know we were drafted , we were forced to go , " he said			0
some forty years later , the man who runs the @entity10 , fully understands the challenges his fellow veterans faced after coming home			1
" no one was ever told about what you would be dealing with or any kind of reaction to war , or the horrors of war , " @entity11 said			0
and with the job , came an opportunity to address an oversight affecting many of his fellow veterans " i think it 's a responsibility i have , " @entity11 said			0
" i think that any @entity5 veteran who had the privilege of holding this job that i have would do the same thing , and i just think it 's an obligation i have to those i served with			2

defense secretary @entity9 has directed the @entity10 to *reassess* @entity5 era discharges
the move could allow veterans who were never *diagnosed* with @entity63 the ability to claim some *benefits*
homelessness and suicide among @entity5 veterans has led to calls for change
