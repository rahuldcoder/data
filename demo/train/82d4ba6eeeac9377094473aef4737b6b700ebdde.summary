@entity3 the serious escalation of fighting in @entity2 is pushing president @entity5 closer to the proxy war with @entity7 that he has long sought to avoid			1
that prospect is increasing as the @entity9 openly accuses its former @entity11 foe of sending tanks and troops in unmarked uniforms across the border into eastern @entity2 , boosting separatists in their battle against @entity19 's beleaguered forces			1
the revelations are sharpening @entity5 's dilemma as his @entity22 considers whether to send " lethal " weapons , including anti-tank and anti-mortar systems to the outgunned @entity2 armed forces			2
@entity5 's nominee to become the next defense secretary , @entity28 , bolstered that idea during his confirmation hearing on wednesday			0
@entity28 said he was " very much inclined " to support sending what the administration calls " lethal " defensive arms to the @entity2 government			1
" we need to support the @entity2 in defending themselves , " he said			2
such a step could take the worst @entity38 confrontation since the @entity11 into a new and unpredictable stage			0
in effect , @entity3 would be sending weapons to be used against @entity7 forces at a time when the @entity44 is increasingly hostile to the @entity45 and has shown it is ready to escalate a showdown			1
there is no guarantee that funneling sophisticated @entity9 armaments into the conflict could be decisive , and the gambit could antagonize @entity53 , @entity7 's increasingly isolated and hard - to - read leader			1
in a sign of possible administration push back against @entity28 's remarks , the top @entity56 general @entity55 told the @entity60 in an interview on thursday that arming @entity2 could spark a " more strident " reaction from @entity7			1
@entity22 spokesman @entity63 meanwhile offered what appeared to be a rebuke of @entity28 on wednesday , saying " a decision like this will be made by the commander - in - chief , " in a reminder of where power over national security lies in this administration			0
the @entity9 also wants to avoid a complete breakdown in ties and a return to the great power competition of the @entity77 era , partly because it needs @entity7 help on key strategic issues , including nuclear talks with @entity81 , the chaos in the @entity83 and in @entity84			1
@entity85 , who served as national intelligence officer for @entity7 and @entity87 at the @entity9 @entity88 from 2010 until last year , said that arming @entity2 would prolong a conflict @entity19 can not win outright			1
" this proposal will not deter @entity53			2
so it is both insufficient but it also is dangerous , " @entity91 said			0
" dangerous because it could take us in a direction that we have not thought about and those consequences are quite real			0
" he went on : " @entity53 has so far been willing and demonstrated an ability to escalate despite the breakdown in relations with @entity102 and the @entity9 , despite the economic fallout , despite the sanctions , despite the price of oil			1
" but the idea of arming @entity2 is nonetheless on the table because its armed forces have suffered heavy defeats in eastern regions to separatists which have been well supplied by @entity113 and apparently bolstered by @entity7 troops			1
secretary of state @entity115 significantly hardened the @entity9 tone on the conflict after arriving in @entity19 on thursday to meet president @entity118			2
" we can not close our eyes to tanks that are crossing the border from @entity7 and coming into @entity2 , we can not close our eyes to @entity7 fighters in unmarked uniforms crossing the borders , and leading individual companies of so - called separatists into battle , " @entity115 said			1
the top @entity9 diplomat also said that modern weapons , including rockets were flowing across the border into eastern @entity2 in breach of a peace deal signed by @entity7 , the @entity19 government and separatists last year			1
since then @entity7 - backed forces have seized large swathes of territory on eastern @entity2			1
since the start of the conflict , the @entity9 has sent military aid including night vision goggles to @entity2 , but stopped short of sending lethal items			1
but @entity115 and national security advisor @entity146 are now open to considering a change of policy , officials tell @entity4			0
the aim would be to increase the military cost for @entity7 's activity in @entity2 in a bid to convince the @entity44 to seek a diplomatic way out			1
the push to arm @entity2 got another boost this week with a report by a group of eight influential foreign policy scholars -- including several former senior @entity5 appointees			0
the group called on @entity5 to spend $ 3 billion over three years to arm @entity2 with lethal defensive weapons			0
@entity5 insists that the @entity163 sanctions , which have hammered @entity7 's economy , are exacting a painful cost for @entity7 's moves in @entity2			1
but while that price is high , it has yet to change @entity53 's behavior in a conflict which started with the annexation of @entity172 last year			0
that reality is fueling calls on both sides of the aisle in @entity177 for tougher @entity9 action			0
" the only thing that deters @entity53 is a show of strength , " @entity180 rep. @entity179 told @entity4 on thursday			0
@entity185 sen. @entity184 , meanwhile , said @entity53 was a " schoolyard bully " picking on the weakest member of the class			0
" it 's time to provide @entity2 the ability to defend itself , " she said			0
administration officials insist that no decisions have yet been made to increase @entity9 assistance to @entity2			1
@entity22 officials declined to comment on the president 's deliberations for this story			0
those urging @entity5 to go ahead with an effort to arm @entity2 argue that he must make the point that flagrant violations of international order perpetrated by @entity53 in @entity2 are unacceptable			1
" a person like @entity53 understands power , " said @entity203 , @entity5 's former ambassador to @entity56 , who joined the group of prominent scholars , who also included former @entity206 deputy secretary of state @entity207 and @entity209 , who is often spoken about as a possible secretary of defense for @entity211			0
" our unwillingness even to contemplate providing defensive weapons sends a signal that we are not particularly serious about @entity2 's capacity to defend itself or in upholding these fundamental rules of international order , " @entity203 said			0
the group called on @entity5 to provide equipment including drones , secure communications facilities , armored humvees , as well as light anti-armor missiles , to target @entity7 armored vehicles			0
" only if the @entity44 knows that the risks and the costs of further military action are high , will it seek to find an acceptable political solution , " the report warned			0
the authors said that the @entity45 faced a critical moment with @entity7 -- saying that if @entity113 succeeds in dismembering @entity2 , it could be emboldened to undermine the security order elsewhere in @entity102			1
" it might tempt president @entity53 to use his doctrine of protecting ethnic @entity7 and @entity7 speakers in seeking territorial changes elsewhere in the neighborhood , including in the @entity241 , provoking a direct challenge with @entity56 , " the report warned			2
the new moment of confrontation with the @entity44 was also reflected in @entity5 's new national security strategy which was released on friday			0
" we will continue to impose significant costs on @entity7 through sanctions and other means while countering @entity113 's deceptive propaganda with the unvarnished truth			0
we will deter @entity7 aggression , remain alert to its strategic capabilities , and help our allies and partners resist @entity7 coercion over the long term , if necessary , " the @entity22 strategy said			0
the serious deterioration of @entity7 - @entity9 relations can be seen by comparing the document to the previous national security strategy , released in 2010 , which speaks of cooperation with " allies and partners around the world , including @entity7 and touts the achievements of @entity5 's first term " reset " of relations with the @entity44			1
as he ponders whether to risk worsening the relationship with @entity7 still further by arming @entity2 , @entity5 could face resistance on the world stage			2
@entity275 chancellor @entity274 , the most powerful @entity102 leader , has already made clear @entity275 will not supply weapons to @entity19			0
@entity274 , who will meet @entity5 at the @entity22 on monday , arrived in @entity113 on friday with @entity278 president @entity277 , seeking to convince @entity53 to sign on to a ceasefire in eastern @entity2 and a long term peace plan			2
some @entity7 experts believe a move to arm @entity2 could backfire , and play into @entity53 's conspiratorial mindset			1
@entity284 , an expert on @entity7 and @entity56 at @entity285 said that @entity53 could also swiftly increase @entity7 assistance to rebels in a bid to lock in quick battlefield gains			2
he said it would be six months to a year before a @entity9 operation could have a measurable effect on the situation on the ground in @entity2			2
" the moment @entity53 thinks this weaponry is coming in , he could dramatically escalate things in a very dangerous way to take advantage of the current window , " he said .			2

@entity9 considering sending arms to @entity2
but critics fear move could escalate @entity9 - @entity7 showdown
no one knows how @entity53 would respond
