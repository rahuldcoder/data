-- @entity1 and @entity2 announced this week that they would shrink their dealer base in the @entity4 @entity1 will close 789 dealers			1
@entity2 announced the closing of 1,100 dealers			2
@entity1 will close 789 dealers , leaving them with approximately 2400 stores in the @entity4 @entity2 announced the closing of 1,100 dealers and hopes to be at a size of 3,600 dealers at the end of 2010			1
while @entity1 dealers will be " forced out " by june 9 , @entity2 is positioning for a smoother closing of its stores , with each shutting down when it runs out of inventory			1
unlike @entity1 's announcement , @entity2 's list of closing dealers will not be made public , leaving that decision to each dealer			1
what happens to my @entity2 or @entity1 vehicle warranty ? your warranty is valid through its term , regardless of where you bought your vehicle			1
in march , president @entity29 announced that the @entity4 government would provide the backing for @entity1 and @entity2 vehicle warranties under the " @entity33			1
" can i take my vehicle for service and warranty work to another ( surviving ) dealer ? yes , but make sure it 's a certified dealer			2
if you 're going to take your @entity1 , @entity41 or @entity42 vehicle in for warranty work , you can do so at a closing dealership until june 9			1
after that time , @entity1 will no longer pay those dealers for warranty work			2
@entity2 vehicles will receive service and warranty work at closing dealers until they shut down			2
will there be good deals on these vehicles ? the @entity1 dealerships to close will have about 44,000 units on hand , or roughly what @entity1 , @entity41 and @entity42 sell across the country every 2 - 3 weeks ( using april 's sales numbers as a guide )			0
there will be deals , but be warned that if those 44,000 are n't sold before june 9 , @entity1 will work to redistribute them to other dealers			1
whether the best deals will be had before or after june 9 is likely negligible ; if you 're interested in a @entity1 , @entity41 or @entity42 product , you will save a lot of money on a new purchase right now			1
one important factor to keep in mind is that approximately 10 % of those remaining units are 2008 vehicles			0
be careful the car you 're looking at has n't been sitting on the lot inactive for too long ; cars actually do " rot			0
" @entity2 's dealer announcement is a different story , since the company is n't releasing the names of the closing dealers			2
dealers who chose to disclose their shutdown may provide better deals			0
@entity84 autos : why do cars rot on the lot ? how many people and jobs are affected by closing dealers ? the impact on communities will be significant			0
since dealers typically employ about 50 people and contract with a handful of suppliers ( consider the business that sells paper or office furniture to each dealer ) , there will be impact within the community			0
some economists , however , believe that the impact will be less than expected , since dealers typically have a high turnover rate and technician jobs were in a short supply already			0
but , the related aspects of dealer closings are certain : think of the little league baseball teams and charities that receive funding from do - gooding dealers			0
even real estate is affected ; car dealerships usually set the market for commercial real estate in smaller communities			0
when those go empty , the entire city feels the pain			0
@entity84 autos : pressure to buy @entity4 why were these dealers chosen ? both @entity1 and @entity2 have expressed interest to shrink their dealer base			1
@entity128 officials cite various data points related to choosing these dealers , but the main one is performance			0
@entity2 said that the average dealer of the 1,100 affected only sold 35 cars in all of 2008			2
@entity1 cites similar numbers , with half their closing dealerships selling less than 100			0
but , even after these reductions by @entity1 and @entity2 , they still have more dealers than other manufacturers			1
using april 2009 's sales data as a proxy , @entity140 has approximately 95 dealers per 1 point of market share in the @entity4 , while @entity1 has 256 and @entity2 will have 172 ( at the end of 2010 )			1
this means that , effectively , @entity140 is able to sell more vehicles per dealership			0
@entity84 autos : fate of the @entity2 brands can dealers do anything about this ? typically , dealers would have protection under state franchise laws against such events			0
however , in @entity1 's case , those franchise laws are not applicable since the company declared chapter 11 bankruptcy			0
@entity1 dealers can ( and likely will ) protest the process by which they were chosen ( sales volume , number of brands in the store , the area in which the dealership operated )			2
but after june 9 , the selected @entity1 , @entity41 and @entity42 dealers will have to take down their signs			1
@entity2 dealers will likely organize their own group , but details of that are unclear at this time			0
@entity84 autos : are extended warranties worth it ? even after cuts , do the big three still have too many @entity4 dealers ? some companies need fewer dealers to sell the same amount of cars : @entity1 of dealers : 2411 market share : 9.4 dealers per 1 pt. market share : 256 @entity190 of dealers : 3723 market share : 15.7 dealers per 1 pt. market share : 237 @entity195 of dealers : 3600 market share : 20.9 dealers per 1 pt. market share : 172 @entity0 : six cars to save the big three @entity200 of dealers : 1304 market share : 12.4 dealers per 1 pt. market share : 105 @entity204 of dealers : 1470 market share : 15.4 dealers per 1 pt. market share : 95 market data shown reflective of april 2009 , courtesy of @entity211			1
@entity1 dealer total is effective june 9 ; @entity2 dealer total is estimate for end of 2010 .			1

@entity1 and @entity2 announce they will shrink dealer base in @entity4
@entity1 dealers will be " forced out " by june 9
your warranty is valid through its term , no matter where you bought your car
you will save a lot of money on a new vehicle purchase right now
