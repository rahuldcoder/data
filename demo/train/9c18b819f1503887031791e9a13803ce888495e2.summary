@entity1 , @entity0 -- hoopla surrounding @entity4 , the techie festival that wrapped up here tuesday , has exploded in recent years			1
the event is famously known for helping to boost @entity7 in 2007 and @entity8 three years later , giving it a rep as a launching pad for new digital tools			0
fresh - faced startups converge on @entity1 , hoping to get venture capital and buzz			2
it 's one of the reasons attendance at @entity4 this week swelled to an all - time high of 30,621 , up some 25 % from last year			1
it also has created big expectations			2
one of the most commonly asked questions among attendees here is , " what 's the coolest new thing you 've seen ? " " that hype has been good for growth			2
but it 's also proved to be a double - edged sword , " said @entity28 , director of the festival , in an interview here tuesday			1
" people expect something to launch here friday and be as big as @entity36 by sunday			2
there are things here that may not hit the mainstream for a couple of years , because they 're not fully developed			0
" @entity43 has gotten so big and diffuse that trends can be hard to quantify			1
but if you go to enough panels and talk to enough people , some themes start to emerge			0
here are five takeaways from the past five days : hardware , not software as digital tech went social and mobile , recent years at @entity4 have been all about social apps			1
two years ago the buzzword was group messaging ; last year it was " social discovery " apps such as @entity57 , which let you know when people who share your interests are nearby			2
but this week , @entity43 has been acting a little more like @entity63 , the annual electronics gadget show			2
@entity65 , which makes desktop 3 - d printers , made headlines by unveiling a device that scans small three - dimensional objects so they can be replicated in a printer			1
also getting buzz was the tiny @entity73 " life blogging " camera , which clips to a shirt or jacket and snaps a picture every 30 seconds ; and the @entity79 , which plugs into a computer and lets users interact with the machine by waving their hand			0
" we 've had a much more hardware and gadget focus than we 've had before , " said @entity28 , who thinks the new wave of gadgets may catch on because of their simplicity of use			1
much of the talk at @entity4 was about uses for a gadget that was n't even officially shown here : @entity96 , the @entity98 - connected eyewear that @entity99 expects to roll out later this year			1
yes , 3 - d printing is a thing @entity65 was n't the only company in @entity1 that makes 3 - d printers , which can produce objects from computer models by layering thin sheets of molten plastic			1
@entity108 was here with their @entity111 printer , which they marketed by having a man walk around @entity1 wearing it around his neck			0
several @entity43 panels also explored the promising future of 3 - d printing , expected to be a hot tech trend in coming years			1
" i think the 3 - d printing stuff is still a little too complicated for most of us , " @entity28 said			1
" but the next generation of this technology will be simpler to use			0
that 's always the key here : the @entity43 crowd is full of first adopters , but can your mom use it ? " @entity131 , the next entrepreneurial frontier with the shuttering of @entity136 's space shuttle program , many feared the exploration of outer space would wane with it			0
instead , innovators have leaped into action , sometimes aiming even higher than government agencies have ( at least publicly ) dared			0
that enthusiasm was on ample display at @entity4 this week			1
at least 15 panels focused on private space travel during the festival			1
entrepreneurs proposed everything from a @entity153 fly - by that would launch in 2018 to building new , privately owned modules on the @entity152			2
someone even proposed a multibillion - dollar reality show following prospective astronauts training for a one - way mission to @entity153			2
@entity158 , the ceo of private company @entity159 , hosted one of the most popular keynotes of the week			2
he detailed his company 's recent mission to the @entity152 and showed a never - before - seen video of a reusable rocket designed to one day blast capsules into space and then safely land itself			2
he said he wants to see humans on @entity153			0
" i would like to die on @entity153 , " he joked			0
" just not on impact			0
" big , large , enormous data @entity173 , the scientist behind the data - driven @entity175 computational search engine , told a @entity43 audience that " in the modern world , everyone should learn data science , " or mining large databases for useful patterns of information			1
@entity185 , the @entity186 data guru who got a flood of press when he correctly predicted results in all 50 states during last fall 's presidential election , hosted a keynote in which he said data - crunching could have useful applications in the public sector , such as studying incarceration data to reform the prison system			1
most government agencies collect reams of data but it gets ignored because of bureaucracy , said @entity185			0
" but we should understand that it 's hard to take this big data and turn it into progress , " he said , no doubt splashing cold water on the many startups seeking to scour databases , such as @entity7 stats , for lucrative products			1
on the flip side , a @entity213 professor showed how combining online data with facial - recognition software could reveal a surprisingly detailed dossier on a person , including an educated guess about their social security number			1
more celebrities ( human ones , too ) ! when compared to its glitzier siblings , the @entity43 film and music festivals , @entity4 has until recently been low in celebrity wattage			1
let 's face it , tech geeks do n't walk the red carpet much			0
but as more famous people embrace technology -- everyone wants to look smart -- @entity43 is attracting bigger names with only tangential connections to the tech industry			0
this year 's event featured talks by @entity242 host @entity241 , former vice president @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 , mayor @entity246 and hoops star @entity247			0
this trend is not an accident			0
" there are a lot of people here , and it makes it easier ( on us ) if you can get someone like a @entity241 who can fill a big room , " @entity28 said			0
however , the biggest celebrity at @entity43 was n't even part of the official programming : viral web star @entity261 , who posed for photos in the @entity265 and drew lines of fans around the block			0
that just goes to prove : you can launch the cleverest app in the world , but cats still rule the @entity98 .			0

the @entity4 festival wrapped up tuesday after five days
festival director : " we 've had a much more hardware and gadget focus than *...* before "
other trends : 3 - d printing , private *spaceflight* , mining big data
festival attendance swelled to an all - time high of 30,621 , up some 25 % from last year
