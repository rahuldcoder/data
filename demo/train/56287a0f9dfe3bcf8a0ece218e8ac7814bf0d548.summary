-- the @entity2 's highest selling newspaper may be embarking on a giant cover up -- much to the delight of its critics -- and putting an end to a tradition opponents see as sexist and outdated			1
the @entity9 's topless model on @entity10 has been a tradition since the 1970s			1
a photo of a bare - breasted young woman along with a corny caption was the newspaper 's way of giving its largely male readers a break from the often depressing news of the day			2
page 3 quickly became part of @entity9 's brand , making the transition from black and white photos to color , then onto the paper 's website			1
page 3 models often support @entity9 's campaigning journalism and are taken on tours to meet serving military			1
nudity in newspapers is not the exclusive domain of the sun. the press and advertising campaigns will often use flesh to draw in the eyeballs in parts of @entity41			0
but now @entity9 's owner @entity42 -- in one tweet -- has raised the specter of a world without @entity10			1
@entity42 said : " @ kazipooh page three so last century ! you maybe right , do n't know but considering			2
perhaps halfway house with glamorous fashionistas			0
" @entity42 later tempered this , saying it was the editor 's call			2
but it was music to the ears of campaigners at " no more @entity10			2
" the campaign was started by @entity58 when she realized the day after @entity59 won @entity61 gold in the heptathlon for @entity63 last summer " the largest female image in @entity9 was of a young woman showing her breasts			2
" on april 1 , it had 88,000 signatures supporting an end to @entity10			2
the @entity9 sells 2.28 million copies a day and has many more readers as each copy sold is read by friends or family			0
a spokesperson for @entity76 said : " in a @entity80 survey commissioned last october almost two thirds of @entity9 readers voted to keep the page 3 format and notably it has more than seven million readers daily of which 45 per cent are female			1
it remains the @entity2 's biggest selling newspaper which means its formula -- brilliant journalism , entertainment , outstanding sports writing -- and page 3 , is working			1
" the @entity80 survey also found readers of most of the other national papers were more likely to favor an end to the @entity9 's @entity10			1
meanwhile , the @entity2 media landscape is changing after the @entity95 into phone hacking			0
@entity9 staffers have been arrested , its sister paper @entity98 was closed by @entity42 and codes of conduct are being imposed on the media			1
the emphasis is on ethics , and that might not sit well on @entity10			0
one anti-page 3 campaigner , @entity105 , told @entity0 : " it 's exploitative , it 's from the 1970s , and the girls back then were very young they were putting in the newspaper			2
they 're not much older now			0
but it really feels very outdated , that kind of sexism			0
" others have tried before			0
@entity114 was a leading @entity115 mp when in 1986 she tried unsuccessfully to push through legislation that would have outlawed topless models in newspapers			0
in 2007 , @entity114 tried again , only for @entity9 to launch a " @entity119 " campaign with models being driven by bus to pose outside to the former mp 's home			1
in the @entity2 , topless and nude model magazines are largely restricted to the top shelves of stores where children ca n't reach them			1
only a couple of newspapers containing nudity are put on bottom shelf			0
elsewhere in @entity41 , different standards apply in different markets with topless models used on advertising hoardings for everything from soap to sweaters			0
some of the @entity2 's @entity10 models have used their exposure as launchpad for other careers			1
@entity144 , perhaps the best - known of them , had a string of pop hits			0
and @entity148 , another pin - up of the 1980s , became an actress in long - running @entity2 shows like " @entity151 " and " @entity152			0
" but even @entity148 , voted by @entity9 readers in 2005 as the best page 3 girl ever , said : " it 's time for it to go			1
i really think things have moved on so far with the internet and with everything else that i do n't feel that we really need that in our national newspapers anymore			0

campaigners hope @entity2 's biggest newspaper will stop *publishing* topless model photos
@entity42 , owner of @entity9 , tweeted the page 3 girl might be outdated
even one former model now says it is time for @entity10 to end
the @entity9 uses its models in journalism campaigns and marketing
