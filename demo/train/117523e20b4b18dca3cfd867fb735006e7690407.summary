-- it 's hard to imagine a more powerful indictment of a government 's behavior than the one just handed down by a @entity6 panel tasked with investigating human rights in @entity8			1
in a 372 - page report , the @entity9 on @entity8 outlined harrowing claims of " extermination , murder , enslavement , torture , imprisonment , rape ... and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation			1
" after years of flouting international pressure over its nuclear program , it 's unclear whether these latest allegations are any more likely to alter @entity25 's behavior			0
and while there has already been speculation over how things might play out differently this time , many analysts remain skeptical about the prospects for change			0
will @entity32 please stand up ? @entity32 is widely seen as having more leverage over @entity8 than any other country , not least because it is a vital source of resources			1
@entity32 supplies its neighbor with virtually all of its fuel needs and some 80 percent of all its imports			2
" @entity32 holds the very survival of the @entity46 ) regime in its hands , " argues @entity39 , deputy assistant to the vice president for national security affairs in the @entity43 administration			1
" @entity8 's access to energy , food , and finance is heavily dependent on @entity32 , " says @entity39 , now ceo of the consultancy firm @entity48			1
" @entity53 also has decades of relatively close party - to - party and military - to - military relations with @entity25 , which should be a great advantage in terms of understanding and influencing @entity8 's leadership			1
and of course @entity32 is home to hundreds of thousands of @entity8 migrants ( perhaps more ) who earn a living in @entity32 while bringing currency and goods back to @entity8			1
" but as @entity65 , a @entity66 specialist at @entity68 's @entity67 , argues , @entity53 is unlikely to back a push for more sanctions anytime soon			0
" the @entity32 government has already contested the key findings of the @entity9 's report , " @entity65 says			1
" it 's highly unlikely that @entity53 will support targeted sanctions " aimed at members of the regime			2
" it would be nice to see the five members of the @entity83 talks express support for the report , though there 's little chance of @entity32 doing this , " agrees @entity78 , author of " @entity79 : @entity8 , past and @entity89 " and a former director for @entity92 affairs at the @entity93			1
so what 's behind @entity32 's reticence ? as the @entity97 notes , @entity32 has generally resisted the imposition of tough international sanctions on its neighbor in hopes of " avoiding regime collapse and an influx of refugees across their shared 800 - mile border			1
" and @entity32 's @entity106 was certainly quick to dismiss the possibility of taking action over the commission 's findings			1
" of course we can not accept this unreasonable criticism , " @entity111 quoted @entity113 spokeswoman @entity112 as saying			0
" we believe that politicizing human - rights issues is not conducive towards improving a country 's human rights			2
" anyone else , then ? @entity65 says that individual countries can -- and have -- applied their own targeted sanctions against @entity25			0
but he adds that such measures have had a limited impact because of what he describes as the growing trend of the @entity8 regime toward conducting more of its commercial activities inside of @entity32 with private companies as partners			1
" @entity32 authorities deem these commercial activities to be benign economic , development - related interactions , " @entity65 says , noting that under prior @entity132 sanctions resolutions , @entity6 member states are n't prohibited from engaging in economic development and humanitarian assistance activities with @entity8			1
" this clause constitutes a loophole that directly benefits the regime through its current configuration of commercial activities with private @entity32 companies			1
" what about the @entity145 ? so , if @entity32 is unwilling to press @entity8 more , could the @entity145 act ? " the @entity145 should double down on a strategy of supporting defectors and refugees , barring access to the global financial system for officials complicit in crimes against humanity , and presenting a clear moral choice for the regime -- immediately cease these atrocities or face the consequences , " says @entity146 , managing director of @entity147 and co-founder and former executive director of @entity145 - based @entity150 in @entity8 , a non-governmental organization			1
in practical terms , @entity39 adds that a crucial step for the @entity145 would be doing more -- directly , with allies , or in support of allies -- to get more truthful information into and out of @entity8			2
" this may sound overly simple or inconsequential , but it is n't , " @entity39 says			0
" @entity8 may have the most manipulated and politically pulverized population in history			2
we need to increase access to the truth within @entity8 and also raise the international profile of the crimes against humanity within @entity8			2
" and if nothing else , the @entity6 report may have done just that , according to @entity181 , director of the @entity182 at the @entity183			1
" everybody who studies @entity8 already knew this , " @entity181 says			2
" but simply having this cataloged by the @entity6 makes it difficult to ignore			2
in that sense , i think the report is important			0
" could @entity46 be prosecuted ? in addition to issuing a scathing report , the commission said it would refer its findings to the @entity195 or possible prosecution , adding that it had also sent a letter warning @entity46 that he could face prosecution for crimes against humanity			0
other options it said were on the table included the establishment of an ad hoc tribunal by the @entity6			2
however , prosecution by the @entity195 requires the support of the permanent members of the @entity93 , and @entity32 has already effectively ruled this out			2
" we believe that taking human rights issues to the @entity195 is not helpful to improving a country 's human - rights situation , " @entity32 's @entity106 said tuesday			1
@entity39 suggests this should not come as a surprise			0
" when it comes to issues like those contained in the latest @entity221 human rights report , it 's extremely unlikely that @entity32 would expend any effort to influence @entity8 behavior			1
to the contrary , @entity53 is most likely to thwart any effort to expose and punish human rights abuses			0
" do n't expect an @entity227 here the last possibility is arguably the least likely to occur			2
@entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 may all have experienced some form of the @entity227 , but @entity181 says that @entity8 is unlikely to witness anything similar			1
" people are too atomized , " he says			0
" there 's no way for people to organize -- there is no institution other than the government or leadership			0
" this point was underscored by the commission 's report , which dedicated a section to violations of freedom of thought and expression			2
" state surveillance permeates the private lives of all citizens to ensure that virtually no expression critical of the political system or of its leadership goes undetected , " the report said			0
" citizens are punished for any ' anti-state ' activities or expressions of dissent			0
" @entity46 showed his regime 's capacity for ruthlessness in quashing perceived opposition with the execution of his uncle late last year			1
@entity268 was seen by many as the second-most powerful figure in @entity8			0
but @entity46 turned on him , claiming that @entity268 tried to overthrow the government			0
" as our @entity83 detected and purged the @entity277 , counterrevolutionary factionalists at an opportune time and with a correct decision , the party and revolutionary ranks were further consolidated and our single - hearted unity was solidified to the maximum , " @entity46 was quoted as saying in his @entity273 's address			0
@entity181 says the highly public nature of @entity268 's execution was likely in part prompted by a desire by @entity46 to consolidate his position			0
" he wanted to make clear he is n't going to be pushed around			0
" the question now is whether this mindset will inform @entity8 's response to this week 's @entity6 report			1
" they 've already condemned it as a conspiracy , " @entity78 says			0
" @entity8 could use this and the upcoming @entity145 - @entity297 exercises as a pretext for some sort of provocation			1
" " that would n't be surprising			0
of course , the provocations would already have been intended , " he says			0
" but this gives them a way to blame others			0

the @entity6 report on harrowing conditions in @entity8 is unlikely to change much
@entity32 and its desire to avoid a flood of refugees is a major *roadblock* , experts say
an ' @entity227 ' - like event is unlikely because of regime 's *stranglehold* on dissent
