-- @entity2 's peaceful life in @entity3 , @entity4 , was shaken this past march when she witnessed a military convoy heading at full speed and against traffic on one of the city 's important avenues			1
the lawyer had taken an alternate route to get home sooner and be with her 7 - year - old son			2
it had been a difficult day in @entity3 , the capital of @entity17 state : seven people had been killed and four police officers were injured in a series of firefights that caused alarm throughout the city , the state attorney general 's office said			1
a few yards from reaching her home , she was stopped at a military checkpoint			2
" when i parked i saw at least six soldiers in front of my car , getting out of their vehicle and aiming at me , asking me to get out			2
one came close to my door and i heard a sound i had never heard before , apparently of a weapon when you take the safety off			2
few times in my life had i felt so scared , " she said			2
after an inspection , the soldiers told @entity2 that they were looking for a vehicle similar to hers and that she was free to return home			2
" usually , the presence of the army does not make me nervous at all , to the contrary			2
but that day , i really thought they were going to shoot at me , " she said			2
" i 've never seen the city so empty			2
" two days later , a soldier died and another was injured in a confrontation with suspected drug traffickers , after four cartel roadblocks were reported in various parts of the city , according to the attorney general 's office			1
@entity3 , with some 700,000 residents , is a colonial city that until recently was known for its auto industry -- @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 have plants there -- and construction			1
however , the situation has changed progressively until the city has reached notoriety for other reasons			0
according to a report from intelligence company @entity70 , the @entity71 and @entity73 cartels formed the @entity74 , an alliance combating the @entity76 cartel , and launched an offensive to control the trafficking routes in @entity4 's northeast			1
" there were pacts here , and now those pacts are broken and a battle has begun between various criminal groups for this territory			0
this is evident , " said @entity86 , the @entity87 bishop of @entity3			1
the @entity17 attorney general 's office declined to let any of its officials be interviewed to give their version of escalating violence in the region			0
" this was something that has been coming for a while , not only the dispute for control of the territory for the routes , but also for control of the population , through terror , ( and ) control of the economy , " said @entity94 , director of the @entity95			0
in the four years of @entity110 's term so far , more than 34,612 drug - related killings have been recorded in @entity4 , of which 659 happened in northern @entity17 , according to the federal government			1
of these , a little more than 3 % occurred in @entity3			1
like neighboring states @entity113 and @entity114 , all on the @entity117 border , @entity17 has seen peaks in violence associated with the capture or killing of important trafficking leaders who had influence in the region			0
" the people in the city are afraid			0
it can be felt in the streets , homes , with friends			0
all the conversations are about security now , " said @entity132 , a young graphic designer who lives in the city			0
the day after the confrontation between security forces and the presumed drug traffickers , a rumor surged on social media that there would be a curfew in @entity3 , something that was denied by gov. @entity143			1
" even then the city took its precautions and that false curfew turned into a real curfew , " @entity144 said			0
" the city was deserted from five in the afternoon			0
there were few people in the streets , and after seven at night , it looked like a ghost town , shops closed , with little traffic			0
" he added , " i think this is just the beginning of the violent acts			0
other nearby cities , like @entity159 , the capital of @entity113 , also started like this and now are cities where they live a climate of strong violence			0
" another indicator of the growing insecurity in @entity3 and the rest of @entity17 is the increase in the number of disappearances in the past two years , the majority believed to be linked to organized crime			1
from 2007 to january 2011 , the @entity95 , in coordination with @entity174 for our disappeared of @entity17 , documented 118 disappearances , of which 91 presumably were related to organized crime , according to a report by the organization			1
the report indicates that the average age of the victims is 30 , the majority are men , and five of them were minors at the time of their disappearance			0
only one out of the 118 cases has evidence that the objective of the disappearance was kidnapping			0
there was never a request for ransom from the others			0
another characteristic of the disappearances in @entity17 is that they happen in groups			1
only 17 of the victims disappeared individually , and in 23 cases it is alleged that there was involvement by police or the military , the organizations reported			1
the state attorney general 's office declined to comment on the disappearances			1
@entity3 could be considered a refuge for the @entity76 , the @entity117 consul in @entity159 , @entity214 , said in february 2010 in a diplomatic cable published by @entity217			1
the cable is full of doubt about the effectiveness of the @entity4 military in the fight against organized crime			1
in another cable from 2009 , the consul writes that the security model implemented in @entity17 by then - gov. @entity226 was inadequate , and described them as " baby steps			0

firefights have been recorded in @entity3 , @entity4
two cartels have united to fight a third in the area , an intelligence firm says
more than 100 disappearances have been reported in recent years
