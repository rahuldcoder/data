@entity1 , @entity0 -- a @entity4 company is offering a rare chance to holiday on a mega-yacht once used by a @entity8 star and her husband -- and thanks to the recession it 's actually affordable			1
the 100 foot @entity12 was chartered by @entity8 star @entity13 and her husband @entity14			1
@entity17 - based mega-yacht rental business ceo expeditions usually charges around $ 100,000 a week to charter their 100 + foot yachts , however , they have introduced a deal waiving the charter fees -- so guests will only need to pay for the running of the vessel			1
the move to make such vessels more affordable comes as the recession continues to put pressure on the luxury holiday and mega-yacht industries			1
although the costs of crew and luxury food are n't extremely cheap , it is expected this move will open up the recession - hit market to many more potential holiday - makers			2
one of the company 's mega-yachts , @entity39 -- a 100 foot vessel which @entity8 actress @entity13 once chartered , now costs less than $ 3000 per day			1
normally it would attract an additional $ 49,500 charter fee for a week 's use			2
at the $ 2950 per day special rate four people can stay on the @entity39 -- but with the maximum six on board ( $ 450 extra per person ) , the cost per person is a slightly more achievable $ 642			2
the price includes full crew , premium wines , gourmet food prepared by a private chef , amenities such as kayaks , hot tub , fishing / crabbing / shrimping equipment , and even a @entity59 for guest use			0
according to the company , @entity13 said of her charter holiday : " we had an absolutely enchanted time aboard the @entity39			1
a more beautiful yacht does not exist			2
" there is one small catch with the deal -- the boat is based in the @entity71 islands , and any cruises to other destinations will attract an additional charge to cover fuel costs			0
the company 's owner , @entity76 , said in a statement that the deal was largely due to the impact of the recession			1
" travel is down , agents and brokers need deals , so rather than just a few full price charters , we decided to stay busy , put more people to work , and help island tourism by doing charters at cost			0
" since we started chartering 10 years ago , we have been looking for a chance to provide our ' expeditions to the @entity93 ' in the @entity94 at a price any luxury traveler can afford - this recession provides that opportunity , " he said			0
@entity99 , director and sales broker at international yacht company @entity101 , said the charter market was n't a complete disaster , so he was surprised to see such a discount			1
" i would n't have expected to see that			0
we are seeing discounts on average of about 25 percent			0
although , some people are trying interesting gimmicks to inspire new business , " he said @entity99 said that ceo @entity113 's fleet is n't among the biggest or most luxurious on the market , and that this deal appeared to be clever marketing stunt			0
he felt that other larger vessels still warranted their greater price tags .			0

@entity4 mega-yacht charter company waives *massive* $ *50,000* charter fees
the impact of the recession is reason given for the discounted deal
a yacht chartered by @entity13 can now be rented for under $ 3000 a day
