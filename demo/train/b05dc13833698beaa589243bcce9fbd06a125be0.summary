-- middle - aged men who take steps to improve their heart health by eating better , getting more exercise , or taking cholesterol - lowering drugs may end up improving their sex lives as well , according to a new analysis of existing research			1
nearly 1 in 5 men in the @entity11 has difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection , a condition known as erectile dysfunction ( @entity16 )			1
the new study , which appears this week in the @entity18 , suggests that @entity16 drugs such as @entity20 are n't the only solution and are n't always enough to address the problem , says coauthor dr. @entity23 , @entity24 , a cardiologist at the @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27			0
" if you do take care of your lifestyle — eating right , exercising , losing weight — you respond much better to the @entity20 , the @entity32 , the @entity33 , " @entity23 says			0
by the same token , he adds , if these drugs become less effective " that should be a sign that ... you need to take care of your lifestyle			0
' " @entity0 : 7 ways to treat erectile dysfunction @entity16 is troubling enough by itself , but to make matters worse it 's also a known harbinger of heart disease			1
the arteries in the penis that expand during an erection can become weakened and clogged with cholesterol in the same way as the arteries that surround the heart			2
this is why @entity16 often shows up three to five years ahead of life - threatening cardiovascular problems such as heart attack or stroke , especially in younger men , @entity23 says			2
" the common denominator is blood flow , " he explains			0
" if you look at a guy in his 40s who has erectile dysfunction and then you compare [ him ] to another guy in his 40s who does n't have erectile dysfunction , the guy with @entity16 is about 50 times more likely to have heart disease			1
" despite this well - established link , there has been little research into whether addressing risk factors for heart disease ( such as unhealthy cholesterol numbers ) can also reverse @entity16 the studies that have been conducted have been relatively small and have looked at a single location , which means they may not apply to the population as a whole , @entity23 and his colleagues say			1
@entity0 : 10 heart - healthy rules to live by to clarify the effect of heart - healthy lifestyle changes on @entity16 , the researchers combed through the medical literature for placebo - controlled clinical trials in which men with @entity16 modified their lifestyles or began taking cholesterol - lowering statin medications			1
the analysis was funded entirely by the @entity25			0
in the end they focused on six studies that included a total of 740 men and were conducted in the @entity11 , @entity97 , @entity98 , and @entity99			2
in all of the studies , which ranged in length from two months to two years , heart healthy regimens and better cholesterol numbers were associated with modest but measurable improvements on a survey that rates erectile function on a scale from 5 to 25			1
the average improvement in sexual function seen in the pooled studies was three points , one point shy of the threshold experts consider " clinically important			0
" for some men , especially those with more persistent cases of @entity16 , a change of that magnitude would be negligible			0
for those with mild or occasional @entity16 , however , it would translate into noticeable improvements in sexual function , the researchers say			2
@entity0 : erectile dysfunction ? try losing weight dr. @entity126 , @entity24 , an associate professor of urology at the @entity128 , in @entity129 , says that the close relationship between heart health and sexual function " has n't become the public health message that it should be			1
" doctors and other experts need to do a better of job of informing the public that a healthier heart often means better erections , adds @entity126 , who studies the link between heart health and erectile function but did not participate in the new research			1
" that 's the first thing i talk about with all the guys that come in now , " he says , referring to the @entity16 patients he sees in his urology practice			0
" ' are you watching your diet ? what kind of exercise program are you on ? ' just putting these men on the @entity16 medications ... probably is n't enough to get optimal results			2
" @entity0 : the best foods for your heart even if they 're told that it may improve their @entity16 , getting men to change their lifestyle and lose weight is no easy task , @entity23 says			0
he stresses , however , that even small and simple lifestyle changes — such as eating at least five servings of fruits and veggies daily — can make a big difference			0
but the " real key " is exercise , @entity23 says			0
just 10 minutes of vigorous exercise three times a week " does a whole lot to improve your heart function [ and ] blood vessel function , " he says			1

nearly 1 in 5 men in the @entity11 has difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection
erectile dysfunction is also a known harbinger of heart disease
doctors should inform the public of this connection , researchers say
exercise is key for heart health and blood vessel function
