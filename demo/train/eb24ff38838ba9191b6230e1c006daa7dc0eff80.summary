-- at over 1500 meters above sea level , the picturesque setting of @entity2 inspires those attending the @entity5 to take a step back and look at the big picture			1
if there has been one common thread that has run through this @entity12 @entity11 for the past decade and half , it has been the love affair the corporate world has had with fast - growing emerging markets			1
one would have been hard pressed to find a chief executive in the halls here who was not bullish on the developing world			2
but @entity2 2014 may bring an end to sweeping generalizations , as those here representing the @entity24 become more discerning in their hunt for growth			1
@entity27 , director of the @entity28 at @entity29 sees it as the next phase of an economic evolution			0
" some of these emerging economies are well managed , others have some fairly miserable politics , some have good growth prospects , others fairly mediocre , " @entity27 said in interview with @entity0			1
" so i think that it 's good to scrutinize to get much more detail and fine grain in one 's analysis			0
" as an institution , the @entity5 was quick to embrace the shift of growth to the @entity48 and the rise of @entity50 and @entity51			1
in the early 1990s here in @entity2 , i bore witness to leaders of @entity51 being welcomed on stage signaling the start of economic reforms			1
@entity59 and @entity60 were here what as well after the @entity61 broke apart			0
those major forces of globalization sparked a decade - long drive by chief executives to direct their investments to the developing world			0
nearly a quarter century later , today 's emerging markets can be divided into the tortoises and hares			1
large , populous countries such as @entity51 , @entity72 , and the @entity73 shows signs of racing ahead			1
but those that have been slow to reform like @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 have lagged behind			0
with growth that fell from recent highs , all three of the latter countries bore witness to intense protests with citizens disgruntled about decisions made at the top			2
@entity27 says this trend is not limited to the developing world , but it is more pronounced now with growth a third if not half of what it was just a few years ago			2
" we see in just about every country throughout modern history that politics can interfere with the good economic policy and that 's certainly happened in many of the major emerging economies , " said @entity27			2
2014 may turn out to be a tricky year to navigate with the @entity103 in the mix. the @entity105 estimates $ 64 billion was pulled out of emerging markets between june and august of last year due to anxieties over the tapering of government bond purchases by the @entity111 central bank			1
@entity112 , chief executive of the @entity113 , said even the fastest growing region , @entity115 , was hit by the trimming of financial support			0
" @entity115 and other parts of the world over the last six to nine months have suffered because of that , not purely because of that , but have suffered			0
they will need to re-balance and their equilibriums restored , " he said in an interview from the bank 's headquarters			0
as this takes place , the pursuit of growth continues			2
@entity115 continues to impress as a market of some 600 million consumers			0
the @entity73 , according to the @entity105 , is projected to grow 6.5 % this year			2
but from a demand perspective and the building out of infrastructure , the @entity134 continent seems to create the most excitement			0
" what we can see in other @entity115 countries that is terrific , it 's true , but let 's not forget about @entity134			0
@entity134 is a continent where we think a lot of developments are going to happen , " said @entity144 , executive director of the @entity146 - based @entity145			0
so while leaders of the emerging markets try to find their footing after a bumpy 2013 , it will be those atop this mountain who need to decide how much risk they are willing to take in search of growth			1
