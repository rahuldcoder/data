@entity0 -- they came seeking justice as the sun rose tuesday over a courthouse in the heart of downtown @entity0 made famous by its celebrity trials -- @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10			2
but there were almost as many definitions of justice as there were justice seekers			0
some shouted " murderer ! " as the defendant , @entity17 , arrived at the @entity18 for the start of his involuntary manslaughter trial in the death of pop superstar @entity22			1
" dr. @entity17 , " corrected @entity24 , a supporter of the defendant			1
" he has earned that title			0
" so began the long - anticipated trial of the personal physician accused of causing the death of one of the most famous people in the world			1
more than 100 people from @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , as well as the far - flung suburbs of @entity0 , crowded into the dingy courthouse plaza , jockeying for a chance at one of just six courtroom seats , or to say their piece in front of television cameras			1
some read psalms , some handed out sunflowers , some chanted " justice for @entity22 , " and many of them carried signs , transforming a wall outside the courthouse into an international billboard			1
" @entity55 loves @entity22 , " one sign said			1
so do the @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 , according to the signed posters taped to the wall			0
a doctor in a while coat preached about safe ways to administer anesthesia			2
a @entity22 impersonator preened for the cameras			1
" even in death , @entity22 can draw a crowd , " said @entity66 , a @entity0 civil rights activist who grew up in @entity22 's hometown , @entity68 , @entity69			1
@entity66 was the force behind the " @entity73 " to support @entity22 when he was acquitted in @entity74 of child molestation charges in 2005			1
@entity76 , 31 , came from @entity35 and was rewarded by winning the lottery for one of the courtroom seats available to the public			1
she has been a @entity22 fan since she was 7 and wore black jeans , a red shirt , a black armband and aviator sunglasses in honor of her idol			1
" for me , it represents the first time i saw him in person , " she said , explaining her get - up , which was vaguely reminiscent of @entity90 look during his " history " tour			0
" it also represents blood , because we think he was murdered			0
" she pounded a closed fist over her chest			0
that sentiment is shared by many of @entity22 's fans , although @entity17 is charged with the less serious offense of involuntary manslaughter			1
he is accused of giving @entity22 a lethal dose of the powerful anesthetic propofol to help him sleep as the pop star prepared for his comeback " @entity113 " concerts in june 2009			1
defense : @entity22 caused his own death murder also is a major theme for the group " @entity119 , " which was out in force on tuesday , leading the crowd in chants of " @entity123 " as @entity22 's family walked into the courthouse			1
@entity126 , one of the group 's outspoken leaders , also won a seat for the trial 's first day			2
she has attended every pretrial hearing , and was tossed out of court last week during jury selection after getting into a staring contest with @entity17			2
she said she had n't slept			0
like her idol , " i experienced insomnia last night , " she said			0
" i have been a fan my whole life			0
this is my passion , to work for @entity22			2
" court officials warned @entity126 she would have to cover up her t - shirt in court			0
if she flashed her " @entity119 " logo , she 'd lose her seat and be banned for the rest of the trial			0
@entity148 , 49 , wanted a seat so badly she could n't sleep			0
she has been a @entity22 fan since she was 8			2
" i remember ' @entity150 , " she said			0
alas , the lottery gods did not smile on her tuesday			0
@entity153 and @entity154 of the fan group " @entity152 " handed out sunflowers , hoping to lead a respectful vigil on the courthouse steps , complete with songs and prayers			0
but they were upstaged by a @entity22 look - alike			2
they started with " @entity164 , " but the voices soon waned , and @entity22 impersonator @entity166 stepped in with his version of " @entity170 , " complete with @entity22 's distinctive yips and squeaks			1
" they 've turned it into the @entity166 show , " @entity153 groused			0
" this is really serious			0
it 's not the time for a @entity22 impersonator			1
" it was a time for the real one , their @entity22 .			2
