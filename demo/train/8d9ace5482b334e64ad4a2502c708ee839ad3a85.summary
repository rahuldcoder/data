his sentencing starts on october 13 , the judge said after granting him bail			1
there is no minimum sentence for culpable homicide in @entity1 law , so it will be up to the judge to decide			2

shortly after the verdict , his uncle said they were relieved that he was convicted of a lesser charge , but there were " no victors " in the case			1
" it wo n't bring @entity16 back , but our hearts still go out for her family and friends , " @entity52 said			1
@entity16 's mother , june , told @entity59 that @entity5 got the wrong verdict			1
" she died a horrible death , a horrible , painful , terrible death and she suffered , you know ? i ca n't believe that they believe that it was an accident , " @entity63 said			1
weapons charges in the shooting from the car 's sunroof , @entity11 said the state failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt			0
she said she did n't find the state 's witnesses persuasive , and their versions of events differed			1
in the second charge , @entity5 was found not guilty of having illegal ammunition at his house			2

in the restaurant shooting , she said the state had proved its case			0

letting the world know @entity11 presided impassively over the high - profile trial for months			0

@entity5 did not intend to kill his girlfriend , she said , accepting his defense that he thought he was defending himself from an intruder			2

he pleaded not guilty to murdering her in his home on @entity110 last year , saying the killing was a tragic mistake			0
but in grabbing his gun and heading toward the supposed threat , @entity5 " acted too hastily and used excessive force , " @entity11 ruled thursday			2
" his conduct was negligent " and not what a reasonable man would do in the circumstances -- not even a disabled one , she said			0
defense arguments that his upbringing " in a crime - riddled environment and in a home where the mother was paranoid and always carried a firearm " might explain his conduct that night , but " it does not excuse the conduct , " @entity11 said			0
" the accused had reasonable time to reflect , to think and to conduct himself reasonably , " she said			0
not guilty of murder @entity11 on thursday found @entity5 not guilty of murder , premeditated or otherwise			2
she said the prosecution had failed to prove its case that @entity5 and @entity16 argued on the night of the killing , and that the @entity138 track star then shot her in a rage			1
@entity11 was not persuaded by the testimony of neighbors who said they heard shouting , screaming and shots			0
the neighbors ' stories do not match the timings on phone records the night of the killing , she concluded , saying : " technology is more reliable than human perception and human memory			0
" she said she believed media coverage had contaminated testimonies , and that state witnesses were in and out of sleep the night of the killing			0
she knocked down other key aspects of the state 's case : the fact that @entity16 took her phone and locked herself in the bathroom allegedly out of fear for her safety , phone messages between the couple that showed some rocky patches , and stomach contents that might suggest the victim ate later than @entity5 said			1
@entity5 wept softly during the reading of the lengthy verdict			1
