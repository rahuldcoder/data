-- managing @entity1 demands as much of our diligence in infection control practice as @entity5 did			2
and though @entity1 may , in theory , be less contagious than the airborne sars or @entity9 respiratory syndrome viruses , it is spread through direct contact with infected body fluids or organs and has been demonstrably and tragically more fatal			0
the @entity5 experience in @entity14 , though harrowing at the time , has helped us better prepare			2
in 2003 , 224 people in @entity17 were diagnosed with @entity5 , and 38 people died			1
@entity5 , which stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome , had originated in @entity20 and became a worldwide epidemic			2
no longer are highly infectious diseases a world away			0
we have become more sensitive about just how global any infectious disease can be , and that it 's easy enough to " import " a disease			0
@entity5 also reminded us that many infections may be spread and acquired by patients , visitors and staff in health care settings			1
after @entity5 , that sensitivity translated into planning and implementation for the eventuality that a patient with another infectious disease may present at our door			2
we are ready with protocols in place , in particular for adequate screening with the travel history of new patients , providing health care providers with personal protective equipment and ongoing training in its appropriate use , and ensuring rigorous environmental cleaning practices for all patient care areas			1
we regularly engage our health care providers on the critical importance of knowing how to appropriately put on and remove personal protective equipment			1
we have the advantage of learning from experiences in @entity55			0
many of the centers that have been set up for dealing with @entity1 patients there now use a buddy system to help ensure that everyone puts on and takes off personal protective equipment in the safest way possible , and we are going to be implementing that policy here			1
the @entity5 experience also increased our emphasis on proper hand hygiene			1
one can not just rely on the barriers like personal protective equipment			1
we need to also rely on the important and fundamental practice of cleaning one 's hands			0
proper hand hygiene includes washing with soap and water , or use of an alcohol - based hand wash rub , before and after each patient contact			1
we and other facilities across the country conduct regular audits for hand hygiene compliance			1
planning and implementation require resources and expertise , and there is no question that after @entity5 , nationally and federally , our government acknowledged and addressed the need to strengthen our public health services			2
hospitals were given additional resources to ensure they had appropriate infection prevention and control infrastructure , including adequate isolation facilities across the country			0
hospital accreditation standards and guidelines were also substantially bolstered to ensure adequate attention to infection prevention and control			0
more policies were developed to address these kinds of wide - impact infectious diseases scenarios			0
@entity5 also taught us the importance of communication , consistent messages , and accountability for dealing with these types of wide - impact events , and of making everyone aware -- both internally to patients and staff , and externally to the community served by the hospital -- of the situation and what measures were being implemented			1
today , our lines of communication are much more open			0
we began a planning process months ago in collaboration with public health agencies for the eventuality that an @entity1 patient may present at our hospital			0
it is not an eventuality we look forward to , but given the lessons we have learned , we are better informed and prepared .			0

@entity5 *killed* 38 people in @entity17 ; *dr.* @entity129 says there were lessons learned
he says staff learned to screen patients and to suit up with protective equipment
the rules of good hand hygiene also become vital in dealing with disease , he says
