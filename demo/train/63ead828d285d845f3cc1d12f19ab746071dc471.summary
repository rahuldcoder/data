" " i am so sad that the next 15 - year - old kid in a garage someplace in @entity19 , that plugs into his @entity20 and wants to turn it up to 10 , will not have anywhere near the same opportunity that i did , " @entity1 said			1

" @entity1 blamed a lack of industry support , piracy and a lack of appreciation for " the creators			1

@entity47 did not die of old age			0
it was murdered , " he said			0
