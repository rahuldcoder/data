" @entity2 " might not be so amazing , judging from some early reviews of the anticipated may 2 sequel			1
the @entity4 - directed feature again stars @entity6 actor @entity5 as the web - slinging @entity7 and his girlfriend , @entity8 , as on - screen love interest @entity9			1
a sequel to 2012 's franchise reboot " @entity13 , " " @entity14 " is supposed to pack in even more suspense and star power			1
@entity17 plays the villain @entity18 , @entity20 is @entity21 , and @entity22 is the @entity23			1
yet on @entity24 , " @entity2 " is on the wrong side of " fresh			1
" " i 'm sorry people , the most i can go with is ' adequate , ' " says @entity29 's film critic , @entity28			2
" i would call this movie ' the @entity31			2
the problem , at least according to @entity28 , is that all the villains , who were supposed to add thrills , instead make the movie " top - heavy			2
" the @entity37 's @entity36 , too , thought the sequel added up to " an unforgivably long assemblage that never coalesces into a compelling story			2
" and over at the @entity42 , critic @entity41 was straightforward			2
" how bad is this one , though ? amazingly so , " he critiques			2
" villainy abounds , but the villains are strident contrivances			0
@entity7 flies , but does so dutifully , without joy			0
" @entity49 's @entity48 tried to be more measured , noting that " there 's a lot riding on ' @entity2 , ' not just commercially ( although there is that ) but also as a signpost of what lies ahead			1
" " thankfully , " the review continues , " director @entity4 's dizzy , slickly enjoyable sequel gets a ton right			0
it 's a @entity59 spectacle that manages to deftly balance razzle - dazzle , feel - it - in - your - gut slingshot moments of flight and believable human relationships			0
there 's psychological weight to go with all of the gravity - defying , webslinging weightlessness			0
" the @entity70 ' @entity69 was also kinder to @entity7 , thinking the movie moved along " nicely ... until a late , badly handled turn for the grim			0
" the saving grace for @entity74 and a few others was the starring actors			0
@entity8 , @entity69 writes , " brightens " the sequel , while @entity5 , " who 's making a career out of playing delicate flowers , fits the role , suit and moist sniffling fine			1
" if @entity5 checks out the @entity70 ' review , he might not be pleased with the verdict but will probably appreciate the attentiveness to his sensitive side			1
as the 30 - year - old actor told @entity89 at " @entity2 's " @entity91 premiere , personality traits he may have felt insecure about actually come in handy when he portrays @entity7			1
" i think my gifts , weirdly , are the things that i thought i should 've been ashamed of as a kid , " @entity5 said			1
" sensitivity , vulnerability , a very ' feeling ' nature , you know ? qualities that boys are n't allowed to really have growing up			1
" after trying to downplay those characteristics as he came of age , it eventually dawned on @entity5 that those are actually qualities that would help him in his career			1
" they 've led me to playing @entity7 , " he said			0
" the wonderful thing about @entity7 and what makes @entity7 a great hero is his compassion , his humanity , his sensitivity , his care and love for others , his need to protect others and his ability to have empathy for others			0
and i think that 's @entity7			0
that has nothing to do with @entity7			0
@entity7 has the skill , but @entity7 has the heart			0

" @entity2 " opens friday
most reviewers are n't impressed
but they say the leads , @entity8 and @entity5 , perform well
