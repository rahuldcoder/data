strict building codes and the preparedness of millions of @entity3 who live along an arc of volcanoes and fault lines likely kept the death toll -- only six by wednesday afternoon -- low after an 8.2 - magnitude earthquake rumbled offshore and prompted a tsunami , observers said			1
officials said four of those whose deaths were blamed on the quake late tuesday that triggered landslides , power outages , and a tsunami suffered heart attacks , while two others were crushed			1
" they 're a seismically active region of the world and they are very good at implementing their building codes similar to @entity28 , " @entity20 , a @entity21 - based geophysicist at the @entity22 told @entity23 on wednesday			1
he added , " because of that , you would see less damage than in other places that have poorer building codes ...			0
that 's probably one of the reasons there have n't been as many casualties as there could have been from a magnitude earthquake of this size			1
" nearly 928,000 people were evacuated , said @entity43 , director of @entity3 's office of national emergency			1
more than 2,500 homes sustained serious structural damage in the region around the northern port city of @entity53 , the mayor of @entity47 , @entity48 , told reporters			1
most of the homes were built with poor workmanship through government subsidies , @entity48 said			0
@entity47 is about a mile from @entity53 , 60 miles southeast from the epicenter of the quake			1
a 7.6 - magnitude aftershock struck the region late wednesday			1
there was no immediate word on damage or injuries			0
@entity3 president @entity67 , who toured the region wednesday , praised local authorities for responding in an " exemplary manner " to a powerful earthquake and the tsunami that followed			1
" this is a great example to all of us that when we work together in an adequate manner and we when we follow the plans that have been established in the region , we work well , " @entity67 said			0
@entity3 is in one of the most earthquake - prone regions in the world			1
the country sits on an arc of volcanoes and fault lines circling the @entity86 known as the " @entity87 , " according to @entity88 , a geophysicist at @entity89 in @entity90 , @entity28			1
this area sees frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions			0
since 1973 , @entity3 has had more than a dozen quakes of magnitude - 7.0 and above			1
@entity88 said tuesday 's quake occurred as the fault line along @entity3 's coast has constantly shifted in the last 140 years			1
in recent weeks , this area has seen a cluster of activity -- something like 50 to 100 smaller quakes			0
then , late last month , a 6.7 - and a 6.1 - magnitude quake struck			1
the keys to surviving the big ones @entity3 has over the years implemented strict building codes and rigorous evacuation plans , experts said			0
" people are more familiar with them , " @entity20 said of the temblors			0
" they , in general , know what to do as part of their daily lives , plus the building codes are fairly well - enforced in @entity3			2
it 's in their culture			0
" in february 2010 , about 500 people died when an 8.8 - magnitude earthquake hit			1
that quake was so violent , it moved one whole @entity3 city about 10 feet west			1
one month earlier , the importance of strict building codes was underscored when @entity126 , @entity127 , was hit by a magnitude - 7.0 earthquake that leveled 70 % of the @entity127 capital 's structures and killed at least 230,000 people			1
" that 's actually a perfect example of the differences in building codes and enforcement in two different regions , " @entity20 said			0
" any place that has a magnitude 7 or an 8 is going to have some kind of damage			2
however , the building codes play a large part in the damage and destruction that is seen , as well as the casualty level			0
population density plays an important part as well -- but the building codes are really what can save lives in areas that have large earthquakes			0
" in a 2011 report , the @entity154 credited @entity3 's " strict building codes " with playing " a large part in protecting people			0
" " the key to surviving high magnitude quakes is to live and work in seismically safe buildings , while being aware of how nature around us can also change , " @entity159 , @entity154 special representative of the secretary - general for disaster risk reduction , said in the report			1
the report found that @entity127 's quake , which struck closer to the surface than in @entity3 , was " no match for the homes and buildings			2
" " in @entity127 , in addition to [ lack of strict ] building codes , you have a population that does n't have a regular historical experience of large quakes like this , " @entity20 said			0
" last time there was a quake in @entity127 that size was 100 plus years ago and they do n't have large regular seismic activity plus the building codes are not there			2
" he added , " in @entity3 , they 're better prepared			0
whether it 's in their mind every single moment of the day , i 'm sure it 's not			0
but in general , their infrastructure and their population is much more prepared for it			0
" @entity197 , an expert in disaster management at @entity199 in @entity200 , praised the @entity3 's disaster preparedness , saying an estimated 500,000 people participated in a drill in may 2012 in the coastal region of @entity205			0
" the government of @entity3 has been working hard to improve the awareness of people living along the coast to the threat from tsunamis and on what to do if one is approaching , " @entity197 said in a statement			0
" several tsunami drills have taken place since the tsunami that killed an estimated 500 [ - plus ] @entity3 in february 2010 and recent earthquakes in the region have helped to keep the threat firmly in people 's minds			1
" @entity3 's big quake is not @entity28 's fault , scientists say inmates turn themselves in after temblor in @entity3 on tuesday , landslides damaged roads in some regions			1
power and phone outages were reported in others			2
the tsunami following the quake was similar to " high tide , " @entity48 added			1
@entity67 huddled with regional authorities as images broadcast from the affected region showed deep cracks across paved roads and a crumpled coastline strewn with beached boats			0
@entity67 said @entity3 faced the " first emergency hours very well " and defense minister @entity244 said things were calm on wednesday			1
he said the military had been dispatched throughout the quake zone to ensure safety			2
some 300 relief personnel were deployed in @entity53 , which has a population of more than 200,000 , @entity244 said			1
of 293 inmates who escaped from prison in @entity53 , 131 had turned themselves in voluntarily			1
although the temblor was powerful , geologists say an even larger quake could be lurking			2
" this magnitude , 8.2 , is not the large earthquake that we were expecting in this area , " said @entity88			2
" we 're expecting a potentially even larger earthquake			0
" it could be tomorrow			0
or it could come in 50 years			0
" we do not know when it 's going to occur , " he said			0
the quake struck around 8:46 p.m. local time and had a depth of 12.5 miles , the @entity22 said			2
the @entity268 issued several warnings but canceled them by early wednesday			2
@entity270 watches initially extended as far north as @entity272 's @entity271 were called off as well			0
tsunami waves of more than 6 feet washed ashore on the coast of @entity275 , said the center 's @entity276			2
@entity278 saw 7 - foot waves			2
an earthquake of the scale that struck tuesday night is capable of causing tremendous damage			0
so if the initial reports stand , @entity3 may have dodged a catastrophe			0
on march 16 , a 6.7 - magnitude quake struck about 37 miles west - northwest of @entity53			1
a 6.1 - magnitude quake hit the same area a week later			1
@entity3 quake : this was big but a bigger one awaits , scientist says			2

7.6 - magnitude aftershock strikes late wednesday
quake triggered small landslides , cut power and generated a tsunami
president : " the country has faced these first emergency hours very well "
about 300 prisoners escaped in the northern port city of @entity53 , but 131 *surrendered*
