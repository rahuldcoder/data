" her new life in @entity1 began after the @entity26 ruled last year that @entity3 should be returned to her biological parents , @entity15 and @entity16 , known in @entity1 as @entity27 and @entity28 respectively			1
the decision ended a six - year custody battle			1
@entity3 was born prematurely while her parents were in @entity32 , on temporary work visas			1
unable to cope financially , they decided to give her up temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet			0
that 's when @entity38 and @entity39 stepped in and agreed to take temporary custody of @entity3 , when she was 4 weeks old			1
the @entity41 said they made a verbal agreement with the @entity43 to take care of @entity3 until she was 18			1
but the @entity43 dispute that			0
they wanted their daughter back soon after her first birthday and eventually went to court to have their parental rights restored			0
after a bitter legal battle , the @entity43 finally prevailed and @entity3 was returned to her parents			1
@entity3 was given a six - month transition period to adjust to her biological family before the @entity43 left the @entity53			1
now back in @entity1 , @entity3 is still finding it hard to adjust			1
her biological parents have separated since returning to their homeland			1
@entity16 relocated her family from @entity58 , @entity1 , to @entity0 -- a sprawling mega-city on the banks of the @entity61 with a population of 32 million			1
like most of @entity1 's big cities , it 's heavily polluted			0
during the winter , the sun rarely breaks through the heavy brown smog			0
@entity68 says the marriage is over			0
@entity16 appears shaken when asked about her husband and why she packed up and left , with @entity3 and her younger brother and sister -- @entity73 , 8 , and @entity74 , 6			1
" a lot of things were not what i intended and not what i had hoped , " said @entity16			1

asked why , she said , " i do n't know			0
it 's just a feeling in me			0
" now a single mother , @entity86 has enrolled all three children in a boarding school during the week			0
a tough decision , she says , but necessary -- especially for @entity3 , who was a straight - a student in the @entity53 but now struggles because she ca n't speak @entity1			1
" i know @entity53 people say i am bad , i take the kids to school , this is not good			0
but in @entity1 , the @entity1 people do n't think so			0

she lives with her children in a small , two - bedroom apartment ; it 's clean and sparsely furnished			2
@entity86 bought a new piano for @entity3 and @entity74 , who are both taking lessons			2
the apartment and school are both paid for by @entity16 's brother , a wealthy businessman			2
life is difficult , she says , but she has no doubt that despite @entity3 's struggle to fit in , the little girl is still better off with her in @entity1 rather than living in @entity108 with the @entity41			1
" in @entity1 one single mother take three kids -- for me , it is very hard			0
but i love my kids , mother 's love from my heart , " said @entity16			2
