authorities in the @entity2 movie theater massacre found an ar - 15 rifle drum magazine friday capable of carrying 100 rounds , and the police chief said thousands of rounds of ammunition for various weapons had been bought online in the weeks prior to the shooting			1
police took suspect @entity11 , 24 , into custody friday after they say he set off two devices and sprayed the theater with bullets from an @entity16 , a 12 - gauge shotgun and at least one of two .40 - caliber handguns police have recovered			1
investigators are confident that @entity11 acted alone , police said			2
@entity21 , @entity2 , police chief @entity22 said friday night that @entity11 had purchased four guns at " local metro gun shops , " and bought over 6,000 rounds of ammunition through online transactions			1
assessing what authorities have pieced together about the shooting and the weapons recovered , @entity28 told reporters , " as far as we know , it was a pretty rapid pace of fire in that theater			1
" life and death decisions within @entity21 theater @entity42 , ceo of @entity43 of @entity44 , @entity45 , told @entity46 earlier that his company had a receipt matching @entity11 ' name and his @entity21 address			2
the receipt showed that @entity11 bought an $ 106.99 @entity52 urban assault vest , a $ 52.99 @entity54 triple pistol magazine , a $ 52.99 @entity56 magazine pouch , and a $ 77.99 @entity58 silver knife			2
with shipping costs , the total bill came to $ 306.99 , according to a copy of the receipt provided to @entity46			0
the firm sells equipment to military and police personnel -- as well as weekend warriors , @entity42 said			2
the gear that the firm believes it sold to @entity11 is manufactured by a company called @entity72 , a " popular brand in tactical circles , " @entity42 said			0
" we were pretty shocked to have discovered it , " @entity42 said			2
families of victims receive tragic confirmation " oh , my @entity83 , we could n't believe it " was how one of the company 's owners reacted , @entity42 said			0
@entity11 paid for a two - day air delivery when he placed the order on july 2 , which would seem to indicate he wanted the materials in a hurry , @entity42 said			0
purchasing a 100 - round magazine for an @entity16 is unusual , weapons experts said			1
the @entity16 is designed for easy reloading			1
" even without the grand - sized mags , many people who are practiced can reload in 1Â½ to 2 seconds , " said @entity93 , a @entity94 attorney and security and firearms expert			1
@entity93 said a crowded theater offers an ideal location for a gunman -- particularly one armed with a shotgun -- to target dozens of victims			1
a large room such as a theater -- where people are seated in rows -- makes moviegoers easy targets , even for an inexperienced shooter , @entity93 said			1
investigators focus on suspect 's apartment screaming , panicked moviegoers scrambled to escape from the gunman , who wore a gas mask and randomly shot as he walked up the theater 's steps , witnesses said			2
" the very nature of theaters makes them perfect killing zones , " said @entity93			0
a shotgun would do more damage among a tightly packed theater audience because its ammunition comes out of the weapon in a reverse funnel shape and would disperse across a wider area , according to @entity93			1
in a theater scenario , he said , " so many people 's heads are lined up next to each other that if you fire down these rows of people ... one blast is going to kill or seriously injure 10 or 15 people , depending on a number of variables			1
" an @entity16 nonmilitary model , @entity93 said , shoots one bullet at a time and that bullet " may go through two people			1
" theater shooting unfolds in real time on social media no weapons expertise would be necessary to execute an attack such as the one in @entity21 , said @entity93 , a former @entity152 @entity93 agent			1
" any idiot can do it			0
" @entity11 was apprehended outside his white @entity156 parked in the back of the theater , police said			1
three of the weapons were in the car and one was left at the scene inside the theater , said authorities			2
@entity93 offered these details about the weapons police say were used in the attack : -- ar - 15 rifle : a rifle that commonly fires bullets .223 inches in diameter			1
originally manufactured by @entity172 before its patent ran out , but now also made by others			0
cost : around $ 900 and up			0
its military version is a machine gun , which allows a shooter to fire continuously by holding the trigger down			0
the nonmilitary @entity16 is a semi-automatic which shoots one bullet at a time , with each squeeze of the trigger			1
ammunition magazines for the @entity16 commonly hold five to 15 rounds			1
@entity21 police chief @entity28 said friday night that investigators had determined the suspect bought more than 3,000 rounds of ammunition for the rifle			1
as for the 100 - round rifle drum and the weapon 's firing capability , @entity28 said he did not know whether the rifle was fully automatic or sem - automatic but " even if it was semi-automatic , i 'm told by experts that with that drum magazine , he could 've gotten off 50 to 60 rounds ... within one minute			0
" -- 870 @entity201 12 - gauge shotgun : one of the most popular shotguns in history			0
it can be modified to have a short or long barrel			0
@entity28 said the suspect had purchased 300 rounds for the shotgun			1
-- .40 - caliber @entity210 handgun : common weapon for police			1
similar in size to other popular handguns			0
@entity28 said some 3,000 rounds of ammunition for the two @entity217 had been bought through online purchases			1
opinion : can we feel safe in a crowd anymore ? the attacker also used tear gas in the attack , according to police			2
tear gas and smoke bombs would " add to the panic " and make victims less likely to be able to defend themselves against an attacker , @entity93 said			0
the dozens of wounded victims in the attack could well have been hit by ricocheting bullets			0
" once bullets hit a wall , they tend to ricochet down a wall , but they do n't bounce like pool balls like a lot of people think and like the movies show			0
they follow the last surface they hit , " @entity93 said			0
carpeted walls , which are common in movie theaters would reduce the risk of ricochets , said ballistics expert @entity249			2
bullets that have first passed through objects such as theater chairs might cause worse wounds			0
the bullets start tumbling after they first penetrate the object			0
a tumbling bullet will tear more flesh when it hits , he said			0
gun debate renewed after shooting crime scene investigators will likely pay close attention to the location of ammunition shell casings and bullets to learn more details about the attack			2
they also will likely document the locations where victims fell to determine the trajectory of the bullets			0
