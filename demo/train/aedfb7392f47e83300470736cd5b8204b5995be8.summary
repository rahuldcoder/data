her native language is a @entity72 dialect mixed with some @entity14 and @entity5 words			1
but bit by bit she explained the series of events that ended with @entity2 being abandoned with a stranger in @entity26			1

@entity10 says she spent three or four days in the hospital			0

" i did n't know the language			0
the doctors said something like ' go away ' and i grabbed the baby and got out , " she said			0
@entity10 said she took care of her baby for the next seven months , breast - feeding her while her husband picked odd jobs harvesting fruit and vegetables			2
times were so hard that the couple said they spent many nights sleeping on the streets of @entity87 or bedding down in nearby olive groves , with the newborn			2
seven months after @entity2 was born , the @entity42 were hired to pick oranges for a few days at a farm near the @entity26 town of @entity117			1
there @entity118 met a woman who realized she was desperately poor and unable to care for @entity2			1

" she gave me her phone number and when we got back in @entity5 we telephoned her			0
we tried to call but the phone was switched off , " she added			0
