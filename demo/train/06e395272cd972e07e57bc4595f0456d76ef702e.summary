-- the @entity2 17 disaster is a poignant reminder of the randomness of fortune and misfortune			1
but it also serves as a prelude to an emerging security environment marked by irregular warfare , proliferated high - end technology and complex economic and energy dependencies that will complicate decision - making among allied nations and confound coherent approaches to grand strategy			2
indeed , the tragedy has underscored the challenges of a new era in which the line between state and nonstate actors is increasingly blurred			1
from @entity29 to @entity30 , @entity27 to @entity28 , nonstate militias and separatists wage shadow wars using sophisticated technologies that were formerly the monopoly of states			1
this new era is particularly apparent in the case of @entity35 , allegedly downed by a @entity37 sa - 11 surface - to - air missile fired by @entity28 rebels			2
the downing , which killed all 298 people aboard , is a reminder that small groups -- often exhibiting less restraint than state actors -- can acquire high - tech weaponry of great lethality and precision , which can be deployed so quickly people may not have time to make measured decisions			1
as technology continues to progress and spread , this challenge will become even more acute			2
with the proliferation of unmanned and , particularly , autonomous systems that will reduce the role of human input , it will be even easier to imagine senseless acts of irreversible killing , either to achieve a political cause ( terrorism or insurgency ) or out of sheer happenstance and miscalculation			2
once missiles and armed drones strike their target , neither the casualties nor the consequences can be undone			2
the blurring of state and nonstate actors may also increase the difficulty of determining who is responsible , as can be seen in the ongoing @entity35 investigation			1
ironically , in the era of big data , governments may find it harder to identify -- or at least to prove with a sufficient degree of confidence -- who actually pulled the trigger in a given act of armed aggression or political violence			1
recent events in @entity87 provide further evidence of these developments			0
while most observers believe that @entity92 used a mini-submarine to sink a @entity95 corvette , the @entity96 , in march 2010 , some were unwilling to be convinced even by an exhaustive international forensic investigation			0
) conspiracies and propaganda -- disseminated across ever - expanding social media platforms -- fill the void , leaving people to believe what they want			0
escalation may be more likely and deterrence may be more susceptible to failure under such conditions			1
one chilling possibility is that a future attack , perhaps involving a nuclear device , might trigger an interstate war without definitive proof of who really instigated the fateful first blow			0
in an instant war , moreover , once conflict appears to have started , there may well be an incentive for some actors to " use it or lose it , " particularly in the absence of an existential threat of mutual assured destruction			0
in addition to the challenges highlighted by the @entity128 jet downing , the emerging security environment will be characterized by an unprecedented level of globalization and connectivity			0
and while the dark side of globalization has long been identified , the connectivity that fuels our century also threatens us			0
in an era of increasingly capable cyberwarfare capabilities that can be executed by nonstate actors and individuals , malicious and potentially lethal attacks may be facilitated through the @entity142			1
many of these may be difficult or even impossible to trace back to specific entities , and even when attribution is possible , the political costs of a response may be high			1
the recent controversial move by the @entity150 to indict five members of @entity153 's military on charges of cyber-espionage demonstrates the challenges of imposing costs on a subset of actors without upsetting other and often larger goals , such as cooperative @entity153 - @entity150 relations			0
the convergence of these factors will complicate the difficulty of alliance decision - making in the years to come , as differing threat assessments , dependencies , interests and standards for international involvement lead states to pursue competing policies , as in @entity173 's decision to deliver @entity175 warships to @entity37 despite broader @entity177 calls for an arms embargo			0
there are many lessons to be learned from @entity182 's tragic end over @entity28			0
but perhaps one central takeaway is that we are witnessing the end of an era of traditional state power , and entering a new era that could place us only a few short missteps away from cascading into more lethal and disruptive conflicts			1
join us on @entity192 / @entity191 .			0
