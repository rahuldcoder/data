@entity0 -- president @entity4 plans to nominate retired air force lt. gen. @entity5 to be the new director of national intelligence , a senior @entity3 defense official confirmed to @entity1 friday			1
@entity5 , now a top @entity8 intelligence official , would replace @entity9 , who resigned at the end of last month			1
the announcement will be made saturday at the @entity13 , the official said			1
if confirmed , @entity5 will become the nation 's fourth @entity14 in the last five years			1
the position was created after the september 2001 terrorist attacks to oversee the 16 agencies of the @entity3 intelligence community			1
@entity5 , who retired from the @entity20 in 1995 after a 32 - year career , served as head of the @entity23 from september 2001 to june 2006			1
he has served as the under secretary of defense for intelligence since april 2007			2
some political observers have indicated that @entity5 's prospects for confirmation on @entity28 , however , are questionable			1
@entity30 sen. @entity29 , the @entity31 head of the @entity32 , recently said the " best thing for the @entity3 intelligence community is to have someone with a civilian background in charge			2
" the ranking @entity37 on the @entity32 , @entity39 sen. @entity38 , said he has reservations about @entity5			1
" i believe he is too focused on the @entity8 issues and he has tried to block out efforts to give more authority to the @entity14 , " @entity38 said			1
@entity38 's counterpart on the @entity13 side , rep. @entity45 , @entity47 , also said he believes @entity5 is the wrong person , because he is " not forthcoming , open or transparent " with @entity48			1
@entity9 , a retired admiral , was pressured to resign as @entity14 because of differences with the @entity13 over the scope of his role and turf wars with cia director @entity53 and other members of the intelligence community			1
one source familiar with @entity9 's situation said that from the very beginning , " the @entity13 did not have the same view ( as @entity9 ) of what the @entity14 should be			1
" that might be the crux of the problem			0
the law that created the position of @entity14 after the 9/11 terrorist attacks is too " ambiguous , " said @entity67 , a former congressman who pushed @entity48 for intelligence reform			2
@entity69 , the co-chairman of the @entity70 , recently told a congressional hearing that " the role of the @entity14 is not clear ... and as long as you have the ambiguity , you 're going to have these agencies fighting for jurisdiction and power			0
" the @entity14 needs to be empowered with the budget and personnel authorities to lead the community , otherwise , the director is merely a coordinator , @entity69 said			0
some question whether it is possible to change the law , considering the difficulty @entity48 had in getting the original agreement			0
@entity38 said @entity48 must act to give the @entity14 clear budget authority and chain of command within the intelligence community			2
@entity29 has called on the president to define the @entity14 role and then work with @entity48 to make it law			0
@entity69 said a fix is needed now , that it ca n't wait for the longer - term legislative correction			0
@entity45 says changing the law is not the answer			0
" if you have great people working together , even in a mediocre structure , they can make things happen			0
more strengths and authorities in the law does n't guarantee success , " he said			0
there does seem to be widespread agreement on one needed component : presidential action in support of the @entity14			0
@entity69 said the " burden is on the president now to clarify who is in charge of the intelligence community -- where the final authority lies on the budget , personnel and other matters			2
" rep. @entity122 , the chairman of the @entity123 , recently wrote a letter to @entity4 urging him " to remove obstacles which may have formed a stumbling block for others who held the @entity14 position			0
" @entity130 , the president 's chief counterterrorism adviser in the @entity13 , recently said the administration is trying to ensure the intelligence community is " integrated well and orchestrated well " by the @entity14			2
" we want to make sure the @entity14 's role is clear and is able to optimize the contributions that the intelligence community makes on a daily basis , " @entity130 said			0
@entity1 's @entity137 and @entity138 contributed to this report			0
