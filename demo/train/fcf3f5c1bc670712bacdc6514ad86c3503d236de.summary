editor 's note : join @entity2 for his weekly sound - off segment on @entity4 at 11:10 a.m. et thursday			1
if you 're passionate about politics , he wants to hear from you			0
a nationally syndicated columnist and @entity9 - based radio host , @entity2 has said he will vote for @entity10 in november			2
he is the author of " listening to the @entity11 " and " speak , @entity12 ! a @entity14 's view of @entity15			0
" visit his web site for more information			0
@entity2 says gov. @entity18 talks tough but ducks a lot of difficult questions			1
( @entity4 ) -- do you know what was so great about @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 ? they were three of the biggest trash talkers in the history of the @entity29 , but they had the game to back it up			0
somebody should tell that to gov. @entity18			1
sen. @entity35 's vice presidential running mate has been running around the country , firing up her -- yes , her , and not necessarily @entity35 's -- loyal supporters by blasting sen. @entity10 for " palling around with terrorists " and demanding that the @entity15 people know exactly when he learned of the past of 1960s radical @entity41			0
she has stoked the crowds by saying , " this is not a man who sees @entity15 the way that you and i see @entity15			0
" we all know what that is designed to do : portray @entity10 as a foreigner who is n't as @entity15 as she			2
or @entity54 - pack , the hockey mom , soccer mom , @entity58 mom , @entity60 dad and the other coded words she uses regularly			0
but what is truly pathetic is that @entity18 talks tough , but is really scared of facing her own issues			1
since she is good at proclaiming that the @entity15 people need to know who @entity10 is -- an attempt to paint him as a shady figure who might occupy the @entity68 -- the @entity15 people deserve to hear @entity18 answer if her husband , @entity70 , a former member of the @entity71 , agreed with its founder , who wanted to secede from the union			2
is there anything more anti-american than wanting to sever ties with the country ? send @entity2 your questions and listen to his program on @entity82 and @entity4 , thursday at noon et. it 's critical that @entity18 answer questions about whether she disagrees with @entity35 's criticism of the @entity88 administration 's decision to remove @entity89 from the terrorist nation list			1
she spoke in favor of it			0
are they on the same page or not ? the @entity15 people deserve to hear from @entity18 as to why she did n't say a word to rebuke the hateful , pathetic and degrading comments made at rallies featuring her , such as when someone in the crowd called @entity10 a terrorist , someone else shouted , " off with his head " and others suggested he is a traitor			1
lastly , do n't you think the self - described maverick needs to own up to what really happened with the firing of the commissioner in @entity112 ? she was declared by a special investigator to have been within her rights in firing the commissioner , but she was blasted for abuse of power and violating the state 's ethics act			1
so what did she say in a conference call with @entity112 reporters -- who were not allowed by the @entity35 camp to ask follow - up questions ? that she was cleared of all wrongdoing , legally and ethically			1
she repeated over and over and over an absolute lie , and we are supposed to say , " hey , it 's all fine			0
we love her hockey mom schtick			0
do n't worry about that abuse of power thing			2
" well , after having to deal with vice president @entity135 being accused of beating the drum for war by berating and pushing our intelligence apparatus to match his political views on @entity141 , do n't you think we should really care about someone who has been accused in a report , authorized by @entity144 and @entity145 , of using their power and influence to get their way ? sure , her supporters will say she 's talked to the " media			2
" she was questioned by @entity153 , @entity154 and that self - described journalist -- yes , he really called himself that -- @entity157 's @entity156			0
@entity18 has done interviews with @entity160 's @entity159 and @entity162 's @entity161 , and local tv folks			1
but why is she so scared of @entity165 's @entity164 ? and why is she so fearful of @entity4 ? does she somehow think that our big guns like @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 are just too tough in asking questions ? my goodness , @entity174 has actually done more interviews about playing @entity18 than @entity18 has done about being @entity18 ! hmmm			1
@entity35 , sen. @entity176 , @entity10 and @entity177 , sen. @entity178 , @entity179 and even @entity35 's 95 - year - old momma and @entity18 's daddy have all done interviews with @entity4 , sharing their thoughts on the campaign			1
but @entity18 ? not a whisper			2
it 's clear that @entity18 really is n't a true frontier woman			1
see , when you tote a gun , carry a big stick and spit fire , you are n't afraid to take on all comers			0
so , @entity18 , if you want to talk big on the campaign trail to those audiences that do n't talk back , go right ahead			1
but if you truly are the maverick politician you say you are , come on and talk to us soft , coddled , elitist journalists			0
surely we are n't as tough as the moose you like to take down with your @entity200 - protected hunting rifle			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .			0
