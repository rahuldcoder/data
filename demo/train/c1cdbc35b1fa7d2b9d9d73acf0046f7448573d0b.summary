-- the @entity2 classic , a venerable stalwart in the world of consumer technology , may be getting the axe along with its cousin , the @entity2 shuffle , according to a blog that focuses on @entity11 news			1
citing an unnamed source , the @entity12 is reporting that , in addition to unveiling the @entity15 next week , @entity11 plans to discontinue the more dated versions of its music player in favor of sleeker models like the @entity20 and @entity21			1
the blog notes that @entity11 teased a " product transition " during its most recent earnings report			0
saying only that the source is not an analyst , @entity25 says the rumor makes sense			0
