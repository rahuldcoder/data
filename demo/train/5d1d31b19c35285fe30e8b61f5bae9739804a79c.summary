" we 're terribly sorry , " spokeswoman @entity10 told @entity11			1
in a statement , the company explained that " the volume of air packages in our system exceeded the capacity of our network immediately preceding @entity20 so some shipments were delayed			1
" " we know how hard it is for everyone to receive their holiday packages , and we 're working around the clock to resolve this issue , " @entity10 said			1
behind the scenes , perhaps -- but @entity4 stuck to its plan to make no deliveries on @entity20 , angering some customers			1
" thanks for totally screwing us and lying about it all day , " @entity32 posted on @entity33			0
he was responding to a @entity4 tweet in which the company vowed " every effort to get packages to their destination			1
" on the company 's @entity43 page , @entity41 wrote that she ordered her sons ' gifts on december 9 , but the packages have sat in @entity48 , @entity49 , since december 18			1

we expect that air volume to be delivered between tomorrow and friday			2
" the company considered @entity20 deliveries as an emergency measure , but " after much thought and consideration " decided not to ask drivers to work on the holiday			1
" they 've pulled in extra hours			0
we did a lot of sunday deliveries , which we normally do n't do			2
it was n't a decision that we came to lightly			0
" asked why the company underestimated the volume of air packages it would receive , @entity10 noted that previous severe weather in the @entity86 area had already created a backlog			1
then came " excess holiday volume " during a compressed time frame , since the period between @entity90 and @entity20 was shorter than usual this year			1
add to that the consumer trend of doing more shopping online , she said			0
" all of this culminated to become the perfect storm , so to speak			0
" @entity97 responds online retailers are damaged by @entity4 ' mistake			1

some customers received messages from @entity97 alerting them of the " failure in the @entity4 transportation network			1
" in the message , the company offered to refund shipping charges and provide gift cards			1
@entity97 representatives could not be reached for comment immediately			2
" we have a relationship with @entity97			2
we will definitely work with all of our retailers , " @entity10 said			0
" we 're going to make good on our service commitments			0
what that exactly entails i do n't know , but we 'll work with them to maintain that relationship			0
" after january 2 , the day the industry processes returns , the company will examine what happened and gauge its contingency planning and losses , she said			0
weather has caused delays in previous years			0
