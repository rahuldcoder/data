-- @entity2 's @entity1 has been a carnival of color -- but this was a monochrome affair in @entity7			1
a dour goalless draw against @entity9 is unlikely to prevent the host nation from qualifying for the next stage but this game will soon be forgotten			1
even with @entity14 at the helm , the face of @entity2 's @entity1 challenge , it rarely looked like finding a way past a determined and stubborn @entity20 side			1
and when @entity2 did managed to create a chance , it found @entity9 goalkeeper @entity23 in irrepressible form			1
" there was a chance here , a chance there , it was very tight , " @entity2 coach @entity25 told reporters			1
" it was n't a question of us evolving or not ( from the last game )			0
we 've been playing this way for 20 games , we are up against good teams , we need to understand that			2
" it was n't a good result , a victory would have qualified us			0
we need to respect other teams			0
" after the thrilling excitement of the last week 's 3 - 1 win over @entity46 , those packed into the stadium in @entity7 may have expected another action - packed affair			2
instead , what transpired was a rather turgid affair as @entity2 failed to find the fluency which eventually put @entity46 to the sword in @entity55			1
@entity9 , winners in its opening game against @entity59 , showed little sign of being overawed by the occasion and came close to opening the scoring when @entity64 's effort was tipped away by @entity65			1
it was n't until midway through the first half that @entity2 fashioned a real opportunity -- but when it came it needed a wonderful save by @entity23 to keep @entity9 level			1
@entity70 , sporting his freshly sprayed silver hairstyle , escaped down the right and his cross was headed towards goal by @entity14 only for @entity23 to scramble across goal and tip the ball away			0
with the first half drawing to a close , @entity2 once again carved open the @entity20 defense			2
a free kick into the penalty area was chested down by @entity81 into the path of @entity83 but his effort was blocked by the onrushing @entity23			0
whatever coach @entity25 said at the interval appeared to galvanize the host nation for a few minutes at least with substitute @entity88 , on in place of @entity90 , adding a new found impetus			0
it was @entity88 who created the opening chance of the half , crossing for @entity14 at the far post only for the ball to be taken off the forward 's toes by a @entity20 defender			0
but any hopes that @entity2 would begin to grow into the contest appeared unfounded			2
instead , it was @entity9 which looked the more threatening of the two teams with @entity105 and @entity106 both roaming menacingly towards the @entity108 goal			1
but while @entity14 remained on the field , @entity2 still possessed a man capable of producing magic			2
it was the 22 - year - old who was denied by @entity23 once again , this time the @entity20 blocking @entity14 's fierce drive from inside the penalty area			0
@entity2 , having replaced the anonymous @entity115 with substitute @entity116 , began to crank up the pressure with @entity9 visibly beginning to tire			1
unbeaten in its previous 38 matches on home soil , @entity2 rarely looked like losing but nor did it appear able to find that elusive goal			0
that frustration was increased with five minutes remaining when @entity81 's powerful header was blocked on the line by @entity23 with the @entity108 captain looking certain to score			0
@entity125 , the left - back , then embarrassed himself by attempting to gain a late penalty with a dive which won him few admirers			0
@entity131 went close at the other end , forcing @entity65 into a smart save as both side 's failed to find a breakthrough			0
@entity2 's next game takes place on june 23rd against @entity59 while @entity9 will take on @entity46 .			1
