-- what a veteran traveler you are			1
you 've already hiked up to @entity3 and climbed up and down the thousands of stairs of the @entity5			1
we bet you 've also stood awestruck before the @entity7 and the @entity8			1
you 're a regular @entity9 , who co-founded @entity11 travel company more than 40 years ago			1
like you , he 's visited most of the world 's major wonders and almost everything else worth seeing			1
@entity9 and fellow world explorer @entity16 , head of the @entity18 , are always looking for hidden places to discover			1
by all means , they say , visit @entity22 and the @entity7			2
go there and check them off your bucket list			2
but do n't you want to explore places everyone has n't already seen ? that 's why @entity0 asked @entity16 and @entity9 , a @entity18 board member , to pick some hidden gems to explore			1
these are spots where we hope you wo n't always share your trip with thousands of other travelers			2
" who has n't seen pictures and read about @entity22 in @entity37 ? " @entity9 told @entity0			2
" but @entity38 ? it 's an unknown , and discovering an unknown is always a delight			2
" ditto for the @entity8 in @entity43			2
nobody 's disappointed when they see the @entity8 for the first time , but they 've seen pictures of it			2
it 's popped up in tv programs and movies so often , that actually seeing it is no surprise			2
@entity54 , however , is going to be totally unexpected			2
" let the crowds swarm the world 's best - known marvels			1
the lesser - known @entity18 sites below can be found in the same countries -- without the crowds			1
and two spots are still on @entity9 's bucket list			2
that 's right : even the co-founder of @entity11 has n't yet been to these picks in @entity43 and @entity66			1
maybe you can beat him there			2
some of the more undiscovered spots require long and bumpy bus rides through the mountains , while others are located near luxury hotels			0
no matter which you choose , they will knock your ( hiking ) boots off			0
@entity76 , @entity77 called the " @entity78 of @entity79 " in @entity77 , the more than 20,000 - kilometer @entity5 was built from the third century @entity80 to the 17th century @entity81 on @entity77 's northern border and is the world 's largest military structure			1
prefer to see a more complete picture of ancient @entity77 life ? book a high - speed rail train ticket and take the 700 - kilometer ( 435 - mile ) journey southwest from @entity89 to @entity90 in just four hours			0
( the regular train trip can take anywhere from 10 to 14 hours			0
) @entity76 is a stunning @entity93 city from the @entity95 and @entity94 ( 1368 - 1911 )			0
nearly 400 of the 4,000 existing @entity97 - era courtyard buildings are still intact , as is a 6 - kilometer city wall			0
the city was a center for @entity77 's banking industry in the 19th and 20th centuries , and some of the imposing buildings are evidence of the city 's wealth			0
" @entity90 is such a magical place given the incredible urbanization in @entity89 and @entity109 and the fact that every other @entity77 city has lost its wall , " says @entity16			0

" 7 fascinating cities of destruction @entity117 , @entity66 many visitors to @entity66 fly into @entity119 and hop on a quick flight to @entity121 to explore the 15th century @entity122 of @entity3 , perhaps the most stunning structure standing from the @entity124			1

the @entity133 archaeological site , located about 250 kilometers ( 155 miles ) north of @entity119 , seems to have been a religious and ceremonial pilgrimage center for the @entity136 religious world			1
" it is distinguished by a highly organized platform - mound - and - plaza architecture that includes precocious use of finely cut and worked stone facades as well as an intricate , graphic , baroque and instantly recognizable ' art ' style executed in stone , pottery , bone , shell and gold , " says @entity16			0
" it also represents one of the earliest manifestations of @entity152 , where power was legitimized through a belief in the small elite having a divine connection			0
" " the monumental center of @entity133 itself was clearly a very significant place , and its elaborate architecture places it among the most impressive temples of its time , anywhere in the world			1
" take an eight - hour bus ride from @entity119 to the northern town of @entity167 , and it 's another bumpy three - to - four hour bus ride from @entity167 to @entity133			0

" unlike the better known @entity204 and @entity205 sites of @entity169 , this place is a bit of a mystery			1
" while the houses have evidence of lovely art and sculpture , the homes themselves are made of unfired mud brick and present a challenge for conservationists			0
@entity218 's newest @entity217 @entity54 , @entity43 one of the most well - known and admired structures and examples of @entity221 in the world , the @entity8 is a marble mausoleum built in the 17th century by the @entity225 emperor in memory of a beloved wife			1

a three - hour drive from @entity22 , it 's well - known for bas reliefs documenting the period 's history			0
