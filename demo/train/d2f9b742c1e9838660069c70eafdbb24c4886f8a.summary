@entity0 , @entity1 -- one of my first jobs in @entity1 was teaching @entity5 through songs on @entity7 , @entity1 's national television station			1
that was in 1979 , when the @entity10 was just coming out of the tumultuous @entity11			0
ordinary @entity1 still wore drab @entity13 tunics , and top officials debated whether the foreign cultural influences seeping into @entity1 were " spiritual pollution			2
" still , the @entity7 station producers wanted to use national television to popularize @entity5 language , and they wanted a light program			1
i was recruited to join a group of amateur musicians to produce " @entity24 , " a series of 30 - minute specials to complement its weekly program , @entity5 on sunday			2
along with three @entity1 performers , i would strum my guitar and sing @entity5 songs , including " @entity30 " , " @entity31 " and " @entity32			1
" viewers learned new words , grammar and syntax as they learned the songs			0
station producers closely vetted the lineup of songs and narration we prepared			2
they vetoed a few , including @entity45 's " @entity44			1
" we produced 10 shows , which aired for weeks and replayed many times			0
we became local celebrities , occasionally recognized and stopped in @entity0 's shops and alleys			0
even today , the odd @entity0 resident occasionally stops me and says he or she first learned @entity5 through my tv show			2
" it opened a new world to me since you guys were always in costumes and staged the shows differently , " recalled @entity55 , who watched the show as a @entity0 high school student			0
" i remember you clearly because you usually played hero or prince - like role			0
until the launch of ' @entity5 on sunday , ' i did not have the opportunity to watch people speaking @entity5 without any @entity1 translation			1
" @entity5 -- and other foreign languages -- were virtually taboo when i first arrived in @entity1 in 1971			1
years earlier , foreign - language books were burned or impounded as " poisonous weeds			0
" only authorized translators and academics dared to use @entity5			2
president @entity77 's @entity1 visit in 1972 caused a brief " @entity5 craze "			1
the late premier @entity79 , who had lived abroad in his youth and spoke a bit of @entity5 and @entity82 , encouraged this and even launched a program where young children of @entity1 elite were sent to the @entity87 to live with families and attend local schools to learn @entity5			1
some @entity1 schools taught @entity5 , but students ' vocabularies were limited to rudimentary greetings ( " how do you do ? " ) and political slogans ( " long live chairman mao ! " )			1
when the @entity11 reached another xenophobic height in the mid- 1970s , @entity5 again became politically incorrect			0
@entity5 regained popularity after chairman @entity13 died in 1976 and @entity99 launched his economic reforms and opened @entity1 to the outside world			2
in today 's @entity1 , @entity5 is king			1
" it 's important to get a good job and even just get information from various sources , " says @entity103 , a 19 - year - junior at @entity104			0
" it gives me an advantage in a very competitive environment			0
" more than 400 million @entity1 , about a third of the total population , are studying @entity5 , says @entity114			2
@entity1 's rapid economic growth and the boom in global trade and tourism have made fluency in @entity5 a much - valued commodity			1
small wonder that pushy parents in @entity0 are willing to fork out 300 rmb ( $ 45 ) for a six - hour @entity5 course in schools who have hired native speakers from the @entity87 , @entity127 and other @entity129 countries			0
" they want to learn another language to be more adaptable to an increasingly global world , " says @entity130 , an @entity87 college graduate who came to @entity1 to teach @entity5			1
" it 's usually upper middle class and elite families sending their children to private lessons and taking adult lessons			0
" an @entity5 language teaching industry has flourished , involving universities , foreign - financed training institutes and countless private language schools			0
the market for @entity1 's @entity5 teaching business , experts estimate , has doubled in the last five years to over $ 3 billion			1
however , experts say , the quality of teaching varies widely , citing the need to set up a credit - rating system			0
the rush to learn @entity5 has also created a shortage of good @entity5 teachers , especially native speakers			1
@entity130 , who taught in a private language school in @entity0 for four years , says that compensations for teachers vary widely			0
most legitimate companies offer from $ 1,200 to $ 1,800 per month ( before taxes ) for a 40 - hour work week			0
they also cover visa fees , paid national holidays and an end of contract repatriation bonus			0
however , she tells @entity2 , the rates of pay vary from city to city -- @entity5 teachers in @entity172 or @entity173 are paid less than those in @entity0			1
in some cases , @entity5 teachers are given housing allowances and reimbursed for medical expenses but , @entity130 says , these have to be negotiated in contracts			1
@entity5 - teaching has apparently become a popular if not lucrative profession in @entity1			2
who would have thought ? when i was recruited to teach @entity5 songs on @entity1 tv , we did not negotiate nor signed a contract			1
i was all too glad to be paid the equivalent of $ 10 per program and fed steamed pork buns during the taping .			0

in 1979 , @entity7 producers sought to use national television to popularize @entity5
@entity45 's " @entity44 " was among vetoed songs
@entity5 had been virtually taboo when @entity198 first arrived in @entity1 in 1971
@entity200 to learn @entity5 has created a shortage of good @entity5 teachers
