-- reports of a possible cease - fire in @entity3 brokered by @entity4 emerged tuesday , but without a more farsighted approach that addresses the dysfunctional dynamic within @entity9 politics , any truce is unlikely to be any more durable than previous ones			1
this latest @entity12 offensive marks the sixth major military operation against @entity3 since @entity12 withdrew its soldiers and settlers in 2005 , and the first since the massive military campaign known as " @entity18 " four years ago			1
@entity19 secretary of state @entity20 was headed to the region tuesday to join @entity4 's negotiations for a truce			0
@entity4 -- as the only other party with a direct stake in @entity3 's stability and one of the few capable of talking directly to all key actors -- is best placed to play the role of peacemaker			2
there will be cease - fire			0
but events in @entity3 have strained already tense relations between @entity4 and @entity12 , prompting @entity4 president @entity36 to withdraw his ambassador in @entity38 while dispatching his prime minister to @entity3 in a show of solidarity with @entity42			1
with the @entity45 administration openly siding with @entity12 , @entity19 - @entity4 ties have also been damaged			0
opinion : message of @entity3 violence -- @entity42 ca n't be ignored @entity12 says its offensive is aimed at ending rocket attacks from @entity3 once and for all			1
@entity42 wants to see an end to the five - year @entity3 blockade and the reopening of its borders			1
in reality , neither @entity12 nor @entity42 is likely to get what it wants because neither side appears to have a clear endgame			1
there is no way to eliminate @entity42			2
and even if its rocket - launching capabilities are destroyed , which seems unlikely , this war will only fuel its drive to rearm , just as it did after @entity18			0
until the underlying grievances of both sides can be addressed , we should only expect the cycle of violence to continue			1
like @entity12 , @entity4 has an interest in reining in @entity42 and preventing weapons smuggling from its territory into @entity3 , which further destabilizes the already volatile situation in the @entity75			1
despite the strong ties between the @entity78 - led government in @entity79 and @entity42 , itself a @entity78 offshoot , the @entity4 are unhappy with @entity42 ' moves in both @entity3 and the @entity75			1
for any truce to hold , it must also include other stakeholders , namely @entity86 president @entity85			1
@entity42 is likely to emerge from this most recent conflict militarily weakened but politically strengthened , earning the respect and sympathy of both @entity9 and @entity90 across the region			1
for @entity85 , however , the opposite is true			0
the crisis has highlighted his powerlessness and growing irrelevance , even sparking new @entity97 protests in the @entity98			0
@entity85 and his @entity100 - dominated leadership in the @entity98 have little to show for their rule except 20 years of failed negotiations and a feckless and bankrupt authority			0
but the fact that @entity4 is also the primary mediator in internal @entity9 talks aimed at healing the split that has crippled the @entity86 since the brief civil war of 2007 presents an opportunity to rehabilitate @entity85 while reining in @entity42			1
despite its record of violence , @entity42 has also shown it can govern effectively and play pragmatic politics			2
the natural tension between governance and resistance is also reflected in the internal struggle between hard - liners and pragmatists within @entity42			2
opinion : ' @entity121 ' spreads dust of war across @entity124 @entity4 , along with @entity126 governments such as @entity127 and @entity128 , would like to wean @entity42 from its relationship with @entity130 , which supplies it with weapons and other support			2
the @entity12 offensive makes this more difficult , however , and will only embolden the most militant elements within @entity42			1
linking @entity9 reconciliation to a cease - fire arrangement will also give the @entity4 an additional leverage point over @entity42			2
any cease - fire will of course have to bring an end to rocket attacks on @entity12 from @entity3 or anywhere else as well as tougher action by @entity4 on weapons smuggling through the @entity3 tunnels			2
but for this to work , @entity42 ( not to mention ordinary @entity147 ) must also get something , particularly with respect to the blockade			2
because neither @entity12 nor @entity4 trust @entity42 to police the border , reopening @entity3 's border crossings will require a return of @entity85 ' @entity86 there			1
but because this requires @entity42 ' consent , it can only happen in the context of @entity9 reconciliation and the re-emergence of a unified coherent @entity9 polity			2
in this way , not only does everyone get something , each actor has a stake in the others getting something as well			0
such an arrangement will be extremely difficult but not impossible			0
one primary obstacle is @entity12 and @entity19 opposition to @entity9 reconciliation or anything that might be seen as strengthening @entity42			0
this self - defeating policy has been disastrous for @entity9 and @entity12 alike as well as a spectacular failure ( which may also help explain @entity12 's offensive )			0
@entity42 has more international legitimacy than ever , while the blockade of @entity3 is crumbling bit by bit			1
while @entity85 ' @entity86 teeters on the verge of financial ruin , the emir of @entity128 is showering @entity42 with hundreds of millions of dollars			1
the crisis is only intensifying this trend as @entity3 plays host to one @entity90 leader after another			0
in the end , @entity9 unity may be the only way to save @entity42 from itself and rescue @entity85 from political oblivion			0
@entity100 and @entity42 do not have to share the same policies or even be in the same government , but they do have to find a way to share the same political space			0
in other words , they do not have to play on the same team , but they do have to agree on the rules of the game			0
some will argue that bringing @entity42 into the game would deal a fatal blow to the peace process with @entity12			1
yet even without @entity42 the peace process is already dead			1
in any case , we will never know since a weak , ineffective and unrepresentative @entity9 leadership by definition will have neither the mandate to negotiate a conflict - ending peace deal with @entity12 nor the ability to implement it			1
the idea that @entity12 could negotiate with one set of @entity9 while making war on another , always questionable , is now totally untenable			0
opinion : new dangers in familiar @entity3 violence such a " grand bargain " will not be easy , and is certainly not without risks			0
but the risks of continuing to ignore realities are far greater			0
the extent to which @entity12 and the @entity9 , along with the @entity19 and its allies , understand this will determine whether this will be the last @entity3 war or simply a prelude to the next one			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity231 .			0

@entity231 : any @entity3 truce wo n't last without a more farsighted approach
@entity231 : reality is @entity42 is here to stay , and grievances of both sides must be addressed
conflict makes @entity42 politically stronger , while @entity86 is weak , he says
@entity231 : the two must be reconciled , *cooperate* and be included in peace process
