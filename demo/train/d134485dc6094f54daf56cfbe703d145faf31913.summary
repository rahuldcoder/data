in college was not part of my life plan			1
i simply needed some science credits , and military science met the " science " requirement for liberal arts majors			1
it also looked a lot like gym class , which i was quite confident i could do without too much trouble			0
i am very glad that i was wrong about the whole thing ! @entity3 is about presenting you with challenges and testing you -- physically , mentally and emotionally			0
i jumped out of perfectly good airplanes , rappelled , solved problems and met some amazing people the 32 years i have served my country			1
i would not trade one minute of it ! yes , along the way , i encountered people who made snap judgments about me because i was shorter than them , a woman or an @entity28			1
they decided i did not measure up , but i chose to ignore them and believe in myself			0
my family is full of people who are intelligent , resourceful , strong and stubborn -- traits i inherited and i am certain are the reason i have been able to succeed in life and to overcome people who put obstacles in my path			1
one of the most affirming moments in my life was the day i was promoted to brigadier general			2
the look of pride in my father 's eyes is something i will never forget			2
if my mother had been alive , i know she would have had the same look			0
my father served in the @entity50 in the 1950s when he was denied the opportunities i have enjoyed			1
men and women like him -- my mother , aunts , uncles , grandparents and great - grandparents -- suffered disappointments and indignities so that i could have choices and opportunities			2
so , this is not about me			0
it is about realizing their dreams			1
it is about opening doors for others			0
it is about living fearlessly every day			0
