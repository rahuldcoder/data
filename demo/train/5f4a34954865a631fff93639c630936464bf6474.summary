-- it was a great weekend to be a director named @entity3			2
not only did @entity3 's " @entity4 : retribution " become his fourth straight " @entity4 " film to debut atop the chart ; @entity8 's drama " @entity9 " had one of the best opening weekends of all time in limited release			1
in first place , " @entity4 : retribution , " the fifth entry in the stalwart horror / action franchise , earned $ 21.1 million — 21 percent less than 2010 ′ s " @entity4 : @entity17 , " which began with $ 26.7 million			1
this is the first time that a " @entity4 " movie has earned less than its predecessor			1
the original @entity4 earned $ 17.7 million in 2002			1
" @entity4 : @entity21 " grossed $ 23.0 million in 2004			1
" @entity4 : extinction " scored $ 23.7 million in 2007			1
notably , " retribution , " which is being distributed in @entity28 and @entity29 , also sold the fewest tickets of any of the " @entity4 " films in its opening weekend			1
@entity30 , who is distributing the $ 65 million @entity33 ( @entity3 's wife ) vehicle under its @entity36 division , is n't worried , though			2
" @entity37 " franchise 's international prospects have grown substantially over the last decade , and with a $ 50 million international start this weekend , " retribution " has a good shot at finishing ahead of @entity17 's $ 296 million worldwide cume			2
audiences issued the film a " c + " @entity46 grade @entity48 's @entity28 re-release " @entity51 " made a more modest splash in second place with $ 17.5 million			1
though the family film , which was converted into @entity28 for less than $ 5 million , was expected to top the chart , @entity51 was unable to match the numbers of @entity48 's recent @entity28 re-releases " @entity56 , " which debuted with $ 30.2 million in september 2011 , or even @entity57 , which began with $ 17.8 million earlier this year			1
ever since " @entity56 's " successful @entity28 run , which added $ 94.2 million to its total , studios have been eager to capitalize on the low - cost high - return @entity28 re-release strategy			2
@entity64 : @entity64 raced to $ 43.5 million earlier this year			2
@entity65 garnered $ 57.9 million domestically — and $ 343 million worldwide			0
next up , @entity48 will re-release " @entity72 " ( out dec. 19 ) , and next year will bring @entity28 re-releases of two more star wars films , as well as @entity68 and @entity69 — and those are just the films we 've already heard about			0
yet @entity51 's softer - than - expected weekend reveals that audiences may be losing interest in the gimmick rather quickly			1
when all is said and done , " @entity51 " will prove a financial boon for @entity48 , even if it finishes in the same range as " @entity57 , " which took in $ 47.6 million			2
conversion costs were minimal , and for the " @entity81 , " merchandising is far more lucrative than theatrical earnings			0
" @entity51 's " solid box office run will keep the film 's characters ( and appeal ) alive as audiences wait for the recently announced @entity88			1
@entity90 's $ 14 million demonic effort " @entity91 " grossed $ 5.8 million in its third weekend , a drop of just 38 percent			0
the " @entity96 " film , which stars @entity94 and @entity95 , has held up much better than equivalent horror titles and has now earned $ 41.2 million total			0
two other holdovers rounded out the @entity100			0
in fourth , @entity103 / ' bootlegging crime drama @entity101 fell 30 percent to $ 4.2 million , lifting its total to $ 30.1 million after three weeks			0
in fifth , @entity107 ' @entity106 earned another $ 3.0 million , giving the creepy kid flick $ 49.3 million after a full month in theaters			0
@entity4 : retribution -- $ 21.1 million 2			1
finding nemo -- $ 17.5 million 3			0
the possession -- $ 5.8 million 4			0
@entity101 -- $ 4.2 million 5			0
@entity106 -- $ 3.0 million further down the chart , two movies made impressive debuts in limited release			1
@entity117 , the buzzy financial thriller starring @entity119 , grossed $ 2.1 million from 197 theaters , yielding a terrific per theater average of $ 10,508			0
the film opened on @entity123 this weekend as well			2
