the @entity0 -- the proud , pioneering group of @entity2 fighter pilots and service personnel -- lost two more members last week			1
@entity6 and @entity7 both died in @entity8 on january 5			1
their deaths were confirmed by @entity11 , @entity6 's nephew			2
the two men , who were lifelong friends and born within six weeks of one another , were 91			2
" they were friends before they joined the @entity14 , " said @entity11			2
( the different spelling is deliberate , he said , a product of family tinkering			2
) " they did n't go to school together , but in the black community in @entity8 , mostly everybody knew everybody			1
" there are no concise numbers for the total number of @entity0 , the first @entity28 - @entity27 military aviators in the @entity27 service corps			1
the group is generally said to consist of anybody who went through the " @entity32 , " the @entity34 program established to train african - americans for the war effort , according to @entity0 , a group devoted to the history of the @entity38			1
@entity0 's historic love story " the @entity0 included pilots , navigators , bombardiers , maintenance and support staff , instructors , and all the personnel who kept the planes in the air , " the group 's website states			1
famous airmen include @entity52 , who became the @entity54 's first black general			0
their story was told in the 2012 @entity57 - produced film " @entity58			1
" @entity59 , a historian of the @entity38 , estimates that there are 200 known survivors left of the @entity32 , though the number may be higher			1
there are just 20 left in the @entity8 chapter ; three have died in the past three months , said @entity59			1
given that trainees went through the program from 1941 to 1949 , it 's a safe assumption that any survivors are in their 80s or older today -- and like other @entity2 veterans , their numbers are dwindling			0
as of july , about 1 million @entity2 veterans were still alive , of the 16 million who served			2
according to the @entity74 ( @entity75 ) , about 400 die every day			0
" these guys and gals are in their 90s , " observed @entity76 , a leader of the @entity78 @entity77 , another organization devoted to spreading the word about the @entity0			1
@entity59 said that one airman he knows of is 105 , the oldest known living airman			0
@entity6 trained as a mechanic and was crew chief of a plane called @entity90 's @entity89 in 2011 , he had a chance to sit in the @entity92 red - tailed @entity92 that the @entity78 @entity77 takes across the country , the first time he 'd sat in the cockpit of a @entity92 in decades , @entity85 's newsletter observed back then			2
what 's more , " he was wearing the same jacket he wore " in a 1944 photograph of himself in the plane , the newsletter said			0
@entity76 recalls that @entity6 had a spring in his step , hopping into the cockpit like a much younger man			0
@entity76 flew the plane in to @entity104 , where " @entity108 , " as @entity6 was called , was one of many who visited it			0
@entity11 , the nephew , said his uncle was proud of his service , though " he did n't talk about it much			0
" just 19 when he enlisted , @entity6 saw the brutal segregation of @entity113 -- much different than the culture he left in @entity8 -- and the bombing of an @entity117 airfield where he was stationed			1
he also saw the 1944 eruption of @entity119 , the last time that famed volcano blew			0
he spent his post-military career as a skycap at @entity125 and @entity126 airports			0
@entity7 was a supervisor for the @entity127			0
a call to his son , @entity129 , had n't been returned at publication time			0
their example , and that of so many others , is important to acknowledge , said @entity59 , who served 22 years in the @entity135			0
" they made it easier for me , and i 'm trying to make it easier for others , " he said			0
" the passing of the @entity0 makes our mission all the more important to carry on so their story is not lost but continues to serve as a legacy of inspiration , " said @entity85 administrator @entity140			1
