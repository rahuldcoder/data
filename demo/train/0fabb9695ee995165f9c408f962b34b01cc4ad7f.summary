@entity0 -- a hotly debated measure that offers a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who came to the @entity6 as children won approval wednesday from the @entity9			1
the 216 - 198 vote , mostly on partisan lines , sends the so - called @entity12 to the @entity13 , where it was uncertain if supporters had the votes to overcome a certain @entity17 filibuster against it			1
the @entity19 -- or @entity12 -- would create a path to citizenship for immigrants who entered the @entity6 illegally as children under the age of 16 and have lived in @entity6 for at least five years , obtained a high school or general education development diploma and demonstrated " good moral character , " according to a @entity27 fact sheet			1
even then , only a six - year conditional status would be awarded , and before moving to the next phase , the students would need to meet additional requirements -- attending college or serving in the military for at least two years , and passing criminal background checks			2
proponents , including president @entity37 and @entity39 leaders , say the bill offers legal standing to young people brought to the @entity6 who have bettered themselves and served their new country , while opponents claim it is a form of amnesty for illegal immigrants			1
before wednesday 's @entity27 vote , education secretary @entity46 and homeland security secretary @entity47 joined congressional democrats at a news conference to urge @entity51 to pass the bill			1
" these are not the individuals that are a threat to our public safety or our security , " @entity53 said			0
" this is an area where ... our nation 's immigration laws have not kept up with our nation 's needs			0
" the @entity27 has touted the bill as a measure that will strengthen the nation 's military and its economy			1
a potential beneficiary is @entity71 , a soon - to - be law school graduate with a 3.8 average who wants to serve in the @entity6 military			1
under current law , @entity71 wo n't even be able to hold a job after he graduates , much less enlist			0
he is in the country illegally after being brought to @entity79 from @entity80 as a child			2
" all i want is the opportunity to serve my country and to give back to the country that has given me so much , " @entity71 said			0
" ... we 're not a problem			0
" however , rep. @entity88 , @entity89 , said the bill could grant amnesty to more than 2 million illegal immigrants			1
" @entity95 amnesty is not the only problem with the @entity12 , " said @entity88 , the ranking member of the @entity93			1
" the bill allows illegal immigrants to receive in - state tuition at public universities , placing them ahead of @entity6 citizens			1
the bill also is a magnet for fraud			0
" the @entity27 disputed that the bill will give amnesty , noting in a fact sheet that " it requires responsibility and accountability of young people who apply to adjust their status under the @entity12 , creating a lengthy and rigorous process			1
" it also points out that @entity12 beneficiaries would not be eligible for federal grants , such as @entity115 , to attend college			2
" undocumented youth adjusting to lawful permanent resident status are only eligible for federal student loans which must be paid back , and federal work - study programs where they must work for any benefit they receive , " according to the @entity27			1
" this is not some dream road , easy - picking concession of the @entity51 , of the government , to @entity6 citizenship , " said rep. @entity125 , @entity126 , who delivered an impassioned plea on behalf of the measure			1
i 'd like to see you get through college without a @entity115			0
no government assistance ... no health care			0
nothing but your own faith and your own determination and your own work to get you through school			0
and nothing but your own work , your own determination to join the military			0
" beneficiaries will receive in - state tuition in their state of residence , the same as any student , he said			0
the @entity155 has said the measure would cut the federal deficit by $ 1.4 billion and increase government revenues by $ 2.3 billion over the next decade			0
young people who do not fulfill the act 's requirements will lose their legal status and would be subject to deportation , according to the @entity27 fact sheet			2
@entity12 applicants would be responsible for paying the processing fees associated with their applications , and would be subject to " rigorous criminal background checks and reviews			2
" @entity12 beneficiaries would not be able to petition for legal status for their family members until after they had satisfied all the requirements			2
they would also be subject to waiting periods			0
" the bottom line is that it would take many years before parents or siblings who previously entered the country illegally could obtain a green card , " the @entity27 said			2
@entity1 's @entity182 and @entity183 contributed to this report .			0
