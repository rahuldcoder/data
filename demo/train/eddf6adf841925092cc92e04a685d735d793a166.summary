the recent fighting in @entity1 has posed a serious challenge to prime minister @entity3 and his government , raising questions about his ability to hold the country together amid a rising insurgency			2
@entity10 secretary of state @entity9 said sunday that the @entity10 will help the @entity1 government in the battle against @entity14 - linked fighters in western @entity1 , but he stressed it wo n't send troops			1
here are five questions about the deteriorating situation : 1			0
i thought the @entity1 war was over			2
why is there still fighting ? well , actually last year was the deadliest since 2008			2
the number of dead reached its worst levels since the height of the @entity1 war , when sectarian fighting between the country 's @entity28 majority and its @entity31 minority pushed it to the brink of civil war			2
those tensions continue to be fueled by widespread discontent among the @entity31 , who say they are marginalized by the @entity28 - led government and unfairly targeted by heavy - handed security tactics			2
@entity3 tells troops not to strike @entity41 neighborhoods @entity31 anger has made it easier for @entity14 - linked militants to recruit and operate while eroding the public 's cooperation with security forces			1
violence has flared in recent days because of the arrest of a @entity31 lawmaker in @entity51 and the dismantling of protest sites by the army in @entity41 and @entity51			0
@entity31 have rejected the authority of the government , and some @entity31 officers in the army have deserted to fight @entity1 forces and attack police stations and prisons			2
now fears are mounting that national elections in april will bring more violence and descend into civil war			0
wait , i thought @entity14 was on the run ? now they control parts of @entity1 ? the @entity10 made impressive gains in weakening the so - called " core @entity14 " leadership in @entity72 and @entity73 , but affiliate groups , specifically in @entity1 , are gaining strength			1
since the 2011 withdrawal of @entity10 troops , the @entity31 - led group tied to @entity14 , known as the @entity79 ( @entity79 ) , has staged a comeback amid @entity1 's growing sectarian tensions and launched a series of bloody attacks on government buildings and personnel , killing thousands of civilians			1
@entity79 has been working doggedly to exploit the security vacuum across @entity1			2
conflicting reports say @entity79 this weekend captured the western city of @entity41 and took control of most parts of the principal capital of @entity51			0
@entity1 troops are now battling insurgents in both places for control			0
@entity41 and @entity51 were pretty important to the @entity10 during the @entity1 war			0
is n't the @entity10 going to help ? both were important battlegrounds for the @entity10 during the @entity1 war			0
@entity41 was an insurgent stronghold until @entity10 @entity100 fought their bloodiest battle of the war in 2004 to drive militants out			0
in @entity51 , the @entity10 supported the " awakening , " in which tribal leaders turned on @entity14 and aligned themselves with @entity10 and @entity1 forces to secure @entity107 province			1
that was a turning point in the war			0
now that @entity10 troops are all out of @entity1 , @entity109 is not eager to go back in			0
@entity9 said sunday the @entity10 would help the @entity1 in their fight against @entity14 , but " this is their fight			1
" @entity9 : we 'll help @entity1 but not send troops 4			0
what does @entity116 have to do with it ? the international community has long been concerned about spillover from the civil war in @entity116 , and the conflict is clearly helping to fuel violence and tensions in neighboring and tensions in @entity1			1
@entity79 was formerly known as @entity14 in @entity1 but was renamed to reflect its growing ambitions in @entity116 and @entity128			1
their goal is to establish a single @entity79 state , or caliphate , based on sharia law			0
anbar province shares a 400 - mile border with @entity116 and because of the power vacuum there , @entity79 fighters move back and forth between the countries and mount attacks on both sides of the border			1
but with recent setbacks in @entity116 , @entity79 has increased its attention to @entity1			1
i heard these @entity79 guys are in @entity128 , too ? this region is a mess			0
there are signs @entity79 may have its sights on @entity128 as well			0
the group said it carried out a suicide bombing on thursday in a @entity154 - controlled southern suburb of @entity155			0
and it warned about more attacks against @entity154 if it continued to send fighters to @entity116 to defend @entity116 president @entity159 against the rebels			2
weak governments in @entity1 , @entity116 and @entity128 have helped @entity14 gain strength , and now @entity9 calls @entity79 " the most dangerous players in the region			1
" @entity1 , @entity116 and @entity128 are all seen by many experts as proxy wars between @entity167 and @entity168 , a @entity31 nation			1
a full - blown civil war in @entity1 , in addition to @entity116 , could further increase sectarian tensions and destabilize the region			1
still out there and growing -- @entity14 on the rebound @entity10 sending missiles , drones to help @entity1 government			1

last year was the deadliest year in @entity1 since 2008
security void in @entity1 has *allowed* @entity14 - linked groups to strengthen
@entity14 - linked groups are mounting attacks on both sides of @entity1 's border with @entity116
