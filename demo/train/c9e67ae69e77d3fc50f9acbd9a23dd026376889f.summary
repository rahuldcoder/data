some rulings are victories for the defense			0

district attorney @entity229 described the scene in a @entity5 courtroom in may , saying @entity11 became " angered and increasingly agitated , particularly after mr. @entity224 smiled and did not apologize			0
" prosecutors : bump , spilled drink led to double homicide @entity11 's friend tried to calm him down , and the pair walked outside and eventually entered a second club across the street , the prosecutor said			1
court documents identify that friend as @entity242 , who would go on to accuse @entity11 of shooting him in the eye in an incident that would take place seven months later			0
( if @entity242 testifies during the trial for the murder of @entity1 , he can not talk about allegedly being shot by @entity11 , the judge ruled )			1

investigators found evidence they believe links him to the 2012 slayings while investigating the death of @entity1			1
as for the @entity1 case , @entity11 's lawyers contend the circumstantial evidence has gaps			1
" there 's certainly a lot of what i would call smoke			0
there 's no doubt about it , " defense lawyer @entity291 said during a june 16 hearing			0
" but that 's not probable cause that he committed murder			0
and you ca n't just throw a bunch of stuff against the wall and say that 's good enough			0
" now , a jury will decide			0
there is a gag order prohibiting the defense and prosecution from commenting on the case			0
@entity11 's lawyers and mother declined to be interviewed , but both predict he will be cleared			0
it 's a possibility that haunts @entity1 's loved ones			0
" that 's my biggest fear , " @entity315 , @entity1 's former coach and mentor , said			0
