it 's a common error , but one that leaves those with an affinity for @entity4 shaking their heads : the @entity8 country known for its coffee and flower exports is @entity11 , not @entity12			1
now , a group of marketing - savvy @entity11 , spurred by the government 's public relations arm , have launched a social media campaign to set the record straight			1
@entity11 is where famed artist @entity18 hails from ; @entity12 is a university in @entity21			1
the coffee you drank this morning might be from @entity11 ; your outerwear might have been made by @entity12			1
and so on and so on			0
the campaign is picking up steam ahead of its official unveiling on wednesday evening during @entity28 in @entity21			0
a facebook page for the campaign has been gaining upwards of 1,000 followers a day with a flurry of humorous and creative photos bringing attention to the @entity11 / @entity12 confusion			1
the campaign is lighthearted , but has a serious mission behind it -- to use the spelling lesson as a door for people to reacquaint themselves with modern @entity11			1
organizers hope the effort eventually will parlay into real economic opportunities , be it through tourism or foreign investment			0
" people outside of @entity11 , especially in the @entity53 , have a wrong impression of what @entity11 is , " said @entity49 , a vice president of colombia - based @entity50 , a digital services company with many @entity53 clients			2
the @entity59 country 's image often is associated with drug lords such as @entity61 and guerrilla violence , and many foreigners remain unaware of the changes that have taken place , @entity49 said			0
even positive things @entity11 is known for -- such as the coffee and flowers mentioned earlier -- do not paint a complete picture , he said			2
" today , @entity11 is much more than coffee and @entity61			2
more than @entity71 even , " @entity49 said			0
when @entity50 joined forces with public relations firm @entity73 to work on a presentation for @entity28 , the country 's own official brand , @entity77 , asked them to use the platform to promote @entity11			1
they agreed , and the " it 's @entity11 , not @entity12 " campaign was born			1
it is the first of many @entity83 messages that the group will put out			0
the goal is to have fun with it and create an entry point for foreigners to explore their country , @entity49 said			0
@entity11 in recent years has made strides against drug cartels , though the country remains a top supplier of cocaine to illicit markets			2
the government continues to wage a war against the @entity99 guerrillas , though the two sides are currently in peace talks for the first time in a decade			0
the two sides have been at war since the 1960s , and @entity11 president @entity105 has said he wants talks wrapped up by november .			0

group of @entity11 have started a campaign to clear up a spelling confusion
lighthearted campaign has gained plenty of followers
but the goal of the campaign is to share @entity11 's *successes* with the world
