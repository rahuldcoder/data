@entity0 -- @entity2 on wednesday blocked a @entity4 effort to repeal the health care law passed last year			1
the party - line vote , with all 47 republicans in favor and 51 democrats opposed , meant the procedural motion failed to get the necessary 60 votes to pass			1
two @entity8 did n't vote			2
while the @entity4 - controlled @entity13 previously succeeded in passing a bill to repeal the health care overhaul on jan. 19 , the @entity2 defeat wednesday means a total repeal of the measure by @entity18 is dead for now			1
the @entity2 vote involved a @entity8 challenge to a @entity4 amendment that would repeal the health care law			1
because the nonpartisan @entity23 has said the health care reform law will lower the deficit , @entity8 argued that repealing it would increase the deficit			1
the democrats therefore invoked a point of order against the @entity4 amendment under budget rules that limit the ability of @entity18 to increase the deficit			0
that forced @entity4 to try to waive the budget rules in this case , with the motion requiring 60 votes in the 100 - seat @entity2 to pass			2
the threshold proved out of reach for the @entity4 , who hold 47 seats			2
using the budget argument was a way for @entity8 to say they voted for fiscal responsibility			0
senator @entity46 , @entity47 , said before the vote that supporting the @entity4 amendment would be " irresponsible " and " reckless			0
" " the amendment will significantly worsen the deficit , " @entity46 said , noting that senators from both parties are calling for getting deficits and debt under control			0
senate minority leader @entity57 , @entity58 , the amendment 's sponsor , responded that the public will understand that the vote was really against the repeal of health care reform			1
" only in @entity0 could you argue with a straight face that starting a new trillion - dollar entitlement program " was a way to save money , @entity65 said			0
while a repeal of the entire health care law wo n't move forward , @entity2 joined @entity4 in voting for the elimination of a rule , scheduled to take effect in 2012 , that would require businesses to issue form 1099s to any individual or corporation from which they buy more than $ 600 in goods or services in a year			1
most liberals and conservatives view the rule as an unnecessary burden on private - sector employers			0
wednesday 's vote amounted to a push by @entity4 to get @entity8 opposition to a full repeal on the record in the form of votes against the amendment			1
@entity8 concede the health care overhaul can be improved , but they oppose rolling back benefits for consumers			1
" we 're not going to go back and fight the battles of the last two years , " @entity98 press secretary @entity97 said wednesday			0
" we 're not going to go backward			0
we 're going to move forward			0
" overall , the @entity4 oppose the increased government role in regulating health care , claiming it will impinge on individuals ' right to choose care options			2
@entity8 say the law will better control skyrocketing health care costs and expand coverage to millions of people currently lacking health insurance			1
the push for an outright repeal is one of several strategies currently being pursued by the @entity4 leadership in order to undermine support for the law			2
@entity2 @entity4 also introduced legislation tuesday that would allow states to opt out of key provisions of the new health care law			1
specifically , the bill would allow state governments to opt out of the so - called " individual mandate " requiring everyone to obtain health care coverage by 2014 or face penalties			2
it would also allow states to ignore new mandates regarding employer - based coverage , insurance benefits and an expansion of @entity135			0
the motion was introduced one day after a federal judge in @entity138 issued a sweeping ruling against the law , siding with 26 states that had challenged the measure and setting up a likely @entity144 challenge in the months ahead			0
a federal judge in eastern @entity146 has also found the health care law unconstitutional , while two other federal judges , one in western @entity146 and one in @entity150 , have ruled the opposite			1
twelve other federal judges have dismissed challenges to the law , according to the @entity98			0
@entity1 's @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 contributed to this report			0

new : all 47 republicans vote for repeal , while @entity8 unite to defeat them
the @entity4 *proposal* fails on a procedural vote
the @entity2 eliminates a *tax* rule associated with the health care law
