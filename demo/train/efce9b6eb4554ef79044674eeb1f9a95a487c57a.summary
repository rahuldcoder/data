@entity0 -- five people were convicted of multiple manslaughter and causing personal injury saturday over the deadly wreck of the @entity7 cruise liner off the @entity9 coast last year -- but only two may serve any prison time under the plea bargain accepted by the judge			1
the convictions , the first in the case , came after judge @entity17 accepted their plea bargain saturday morning			2
the five were originally co-defendants with the cruise ship 's captain , @entity23			1
but he is now being tried separately on charges of multiple manslaughter in the wreck and abandoning ship			2
court proceedings in his case began this week			1
thirty - two people died when the @entity7 , a luxury liner carrying 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members , struck rocks off the @entity9 island of @entity36 on january 13 , 2012			1
another 150 people were injured in the evacuation of the ship -- 65 of them seriously			1
the injuries include partial paralysis , amputations and , in one case , blindness			0
under the deal , @entity45 , @entity46 ' emergency manager in @entity47 , was sentenced to two years and 10 months in prison and @entity50 , hotel director of the @entity7 , was given two years and six months			1
@entity45 spoke on the phone and by radio to @entity53 the night of the crash between impact and evacuation , and @entity50 was in communication with @entity45 on @entity53 's behalf that night			0
@entity53 's first mate @entity58 , who was the officer on the bridge and in command of the ship when it went off course , was handed a sentence of one year and 11 months ; third officer @entity64 , who was second in command to @entity58 at the time , received 18 months ; and helmsman @entity66 was sentenced to 20 months			1
those three were also convicted of causing a shipwreck , or maritime disaster			1
audio recordings played to the court showed that helmsman @entity66 misunderstood @entity53 's directions to turn moments before the ship ran aground			1
lawyer : ' we will appeal ' in @entity78 , sentences less than two years do not generally have to be served in prison except in some cases of homicide , but not in manslaughter			1
as a result only @entity45 and @entity83 are n't likely to serve any time in prison , although they would first have to exhaust the appeals process			0
the prosecutor backed their plea bargain requests and all five are on the prosecution witness list for the trial of @entity53 in @entity94 , the @entity95 city nearest the site of the wreck			1

" it is unthinkable that these lives and the damage to the island are worth two years or less , " he said by phone			2
" we will appeal this to @entity78 's highest court			2
" @entity53 also asked wednesday for a plea bargain in exchange for a sentence of three years and five months in prison , but the request has not yet been decided			1
however , the prosecutor adamantly opposes it so there is little chance it will be accepted			0
the next hearing in @entity53 's case is scheduled for september 23 , but the judges could rule officially on his plea bargain sooner			0
night of chaos @entity53 faces three criminal charges : involuntary manslaughter for the 32 deaths , causing a maritime disaster and causing personal injury to 150 people who were badly hurt in the accident			1

some crew members helped passengers and then jumped overboard , passengers said			0
remaining crew members seemed helpless to handle the melee			0
the case against @entity53 centers on several questions , including why it took him more than an hour to issue an order to abandon ship and why the captain allegedly left the vessel before all passengers had abandoned it			0
given the complicated nature of the case , his trial could drag on for a year or more			2
the prosecutor presented the court with a list of 357 witnesses wednesday			0
running in tandem with the criminal prosecution are numerous civil suits against @entity53 , which can be heard at the same time			0
this means more than 250 civil parties are also represented in court			0

nearly 500 workers are involved in an operation led by @entity177 to remove the wreck while protecting the marine environment			0
@entity177 and @entity46 said earlier this month that they hope to be able to rotate the vessel to a vertical position in september			0
they will then be able to assess whether it can be refloated and towed away			0
