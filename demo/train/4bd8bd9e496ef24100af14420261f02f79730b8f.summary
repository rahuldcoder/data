@entity6 will withhold content from a neo-nazi account at the request of @entity11 authorities , the first time it has put into action a policy of local censorship it adopted in january and a step that will probably reignite debate over freedom of expression on the @entity16			1
@entity17 , @entity6 's general counsel , tweeted the company 's decision thursday : " we announced the ability to withhold content back in jan. we 're using it now for the first time re : a group deemed illegal in @entity11			1
" big brother still watching : internet censorship on the up but although @entity6 , hailed by many as a powerful enabler of free speech , is taking its first step toward limiting hate speech , some groups say it still has a long way to go			1
the @entity33 has said it " lags far behind " other social media networks in setting clear standards over racism			0
a barrage of anti-semitic abuse prompted by a series of hashtags in @entity41 has highlighted the problem there in recent weeks , with the @entity44 adding its voice to the concerns raised by the @entity33			0
" when free expression crosses the line into speech that society recognizes as an affront to individuals ' human dignity and as thinly veiled calls for violence , then the service provider has a responsibility to establish acceptable boundaries , " @entity33 national director @entity47 said			2
" it is time for @entity6 to set some boundaries			2
" incitement against people , particularly for racial reasons , and advocating the overthrow of democracy became illegal in @entity11 after the fall of the @entity69 dictatorship			2
authorities there strictly enforce anti-propaganda measures handed down against hate groups			0
the neo-nazi club @entity74 used its website for racist and anti-democratic propaganda			0
the site has disappeared from the @entity16 , but the group 's @entity6 feed is still visible in the @entity80			1
in its role of enforcing the ban on the group , police in @entity82 , @entity11 , sent a fax in late september to @entity6 's headquarters in @entity88 announcing that the group 's " accounts in social networks have to be closed immediately			1
" @entity6 's response falls short of the @entity11 demand			1
in another tweet , @entity17 indicated that @entity6 would selectively deal with the feed : " never want to withhold content ; good to have tools to do it narrowly and transparently			1
" the tweet includes a link to a support page explaining how @entity6 can withhold content from view in specific countries			1
police who carried out raids on @entity74 confiscated computers , far - right paraphernalia and weapons , the @entity109 for @entity111 state said in a statement on september 25			2
the group , which had been known about since 2008 , was " dissolved with immediate effect			0
any activity or the building of a substitute group is not allowed , " it said			0
the extremist group 's @entity6 feed includes links to another far - right group 's website			1
it stops abruptly on september 25 , the day of the police raids			0
@entity111 interior minister @entity125 told @entity126 by e-mail thursday that he welcomed the swift reaction by @entity6 and other @entity16 companies			1
" this is a very important step			1
for far - right extremists especially , the @entity16 has become more important as a communications and recruiting platform			0
there is only one goal during the fight against far - right extremism , and that is to undermine and stop the spreading of this inhuman ideology			0
" @entity140 , a spokesman for @entity141 , stressed the company 's transparency over its action			2
@entity145 , chief executive of @entity146 , a @entity147 - based group that promotes free expression , said that what is key is who is making the decision about censoring content			2
@entity6 's action came in response to a request from @entity11 based on its laws barring hate speech , rather than being driven by the company itself , she points out			1
where @entity6 and other websites face a difficult balancing act is where countries ' laws overstep the boundaries of free expression , she said			2
" different countries have different laws about hate speech			0
we , as a freedom - of - expression group , would say ' put restrictions on speech where there is a clear and direct incitement to violence			2
' otherwise , we would always argue for fairly limited controls , " she said			0
@entity6 's move will probably feed into a wider debate in the digital world about the " privatization of censorship , " @entity145 said			1
" there 's a big issue about what do we want web hosting companies and internet service providers to do , " she said			0
" we do n't ask telephone companies to censor what you , or i or anyone else is saying on the phone			0
" if we were to ask or even pass regulation saying all these web hosting services had to vet and moderate everything on their site , when there are billions of things on the site , it would completely close down the ability of the @entity16 to operate as it does , as a wonderful place for free expression and swapping of ideas			0
" on the other hand , if companies such as @entity6 respond instead to government requests or court orders over specific content , " that 's a way of managing it without putting a complete chill on the whole @entity16			1
" as an example of the challenges @entity16 companies face , @entity145 points to @entity220 's recent troubles in @entity221 , where the company 's top executive was arrested for not taking down online videos that government officials said violated the @entity228 country 's election law .			0
