-- the driver hired to deliver an adopted @entity3 boy from the @entity5 airport to the @entity3 education ministry last week said he was " shocked like a crazy man " when he realized what was happening			1
seven - year - old @entity9 was sent back to @entity3 alone by the @entity11 family that adopted him because of what they said was violent and psychotic behavior			1
@entity15 said the child was in " a good mood " during the two - hour ride thursday morning , drawing pictures and playing with his @entity21 toy most of the time			2
but near the end of the ride , he cried , saying he missed " @entity24 , " @entity15 said			0
it was his adopted grandmother , @entity26 , who bought @entity9 a one - way ticket on a @entity29 flight from @entity30 to @entity5 and arranged for @entity15 to meet him there			1
@entity15 provided @entity0 with a copy of his e-mail exchanges with @entity26			0
" i am interested in hiring you for a pick - up from @entity37 ( @entity37 ) to the office of the @entity39 on monday april 12th , " @entity26 initially wrote to @entity15 , according to the e-mails			1
@entity15 responded with an extensive e-mail that included references for his work as a professional driver for foreign visitors			0
his fee would be $ 120 , he said			0
when @entity26 later sent an e-mail to say she had booked a flight that would arrive on thursday morning , she gave no hint that the passenger would be a child , @entity15 said			2
" i had not big plans so i can meet you at @entity37 , " @entity15 wrote back to her			2
" where are you going to stay in @entity5 ? " it was not until wednesday that @entity26 told him his passenger would be a young boy who would be escorted through the airport by an airline employee carrying an envelope with two envelopes inside it , according to the e-mails			1
" one is an envelope for the @entity39 , @entity64 , 11 , @entity5 , " @entity26 wrote			0
" the other envelope will be addressed to you			0
@entity66 will be your payment in @entity68			0
" @entity26 instructed the driver to take the child inside the ministry and give the envelope to the receptionist			2
when @entity15 and the boy arrived at the ministry , he knew something was " terribly wrong " when he realized that no one was expecting him			1
when several women came down to investigate why he was there , they opened the envelope intended for the ministry			2
" i am sorry to say that for the safety of my family , friends and myself i no longer wish to parent this child , " wrote @entity81 , the adoptive mother			0
an angry phone call to the @entity88 followed , with @entity15 talking to @entity26 first , complaining that he had been deceived , he said			1
although the driver 's duty was completed , he said , he stayed with the boy throughout the day as they waited for juvenile authorities to pick him up			1
while they waited , @entity9 used his pencils to draw " a beautiful house " with only one small door			0
he also drew another boy who he said was @entity99 , his 10 - year - old friend , according to @entity15			1
at the end of the day , just before the boy was taken to a special hospital , he gave his driver two gifts			2
he handed him the @entity29 wings he was given on the plane and a picture he had drawn while waiting at the ministry			1
@entity15 said the experience has left him sad and depressed			0
but the most difficult thing , he said , has been the negative comments made in the @entity3 media reports , some suggesting that he is partly to blame for the boy 's plight			1
he said he wanted people to know that he had no idea his passenger was an adopted child being returned to @entity3			1
the incident sparked outrage in @entity3 and the @entity88 and threatens to bring a halt to adoptions between the two countries			1
top officials from the @entity125 plan to travel to @entity5 this week to push @entity3 to allow adoptions by @entity88 families to continue			1
" we were certainly shocked , as was everybody , about the return of the child , " said @entity128 , principal deputy assistant for @entity88 consular affairs			1
" we are hoping to work with the @entity3 to continue the adoptions of children			2
" @entity26 said friday that the boy " had a hit list of people he wanted to hurt			0
" no. 1 on that list : his @entity88 mom , @entity26 said			2
the last straw , the adoptive grandmother said , came last week when the family caught the boy trying to start a fire in the home			2
a @entity3 psychologist who visited the boy friday in a hospital in @entity5 , where he was under evaluation to check his health , described him as " very friendly " and communicative			1
@entity152 said she saw no aftereffects of psychological trauma , but " he does n't quite understand why he 's here			0
" when children are adopted abroad , there are normally several stages of adaptation , including one involving cultural shock , in which children can start behaving aggressively , she said			0
normally , children get over the stage after several months , she said			0
in @entity164 , @entity11 , where @entity26 lives , a criminal investigation is under way , though authorities said they do n't know whether any laws were broken in the case			0
sheriff @entity169 said authorities are still trying to work out a meeting with @entity26 and her mother			0
@entity125 officials told him they are not aware of any federal laws broken either , @entity169 said , adding that officials in @entity164 are trying to unseal the boy 's adoption records to research the adoption			0
@entity179 , attorney general for the district , said officials have not determined whether the case constitutes child abandonment , but if there was , it took place at the airport in @entity30 , where the boy boarded the plane			1
@entity81 did not respond to requests for comment .			0
