-- these are hard times in the @entity2			0
the government released its annual report on income , poverty and insurance coverage last week			1
the median income in the @entity2 in 2010 was $ 49,445 , which is 2.3 % lower than it was in 2009			0
but that 's just the median			0
to understand how bad things really are , we need to look at poverty			1
to qualify as below the poverty line , you have to be really poor			1
a single person under the age of 65 has to earn less than $ 11,244 to be considered in poverty			1
that 's significantly less than a full - time minimum wage job			0
a single mother with a child has to make less than $ 15,030 to be considered in poverty			1
the percentage of people who met these criteria increased to 15.1 % in 2010 from 14.3 % in 2009			0
it 's gone up steadily since 2007 when it was 12.5 %			0
what really hurts , however , is exactly who in @entity2 qualifies as living in poverty			2
because of the social safety nets in place , relatively few people over 64 are very poor ( 9 % )			2
@entity38 , on the other hand , suffer greatly			0
about 22 % of @entity2 under 18 live in poverty			2
let me say that again : more than one in five children in the @entity2 is living in poverty			1
children account for more than one - third of all such people in the @entity2 right now			2
think about that when we talk about how to save money in the future			1
i 'm a health services researcher , and incredibly invested in how we reform the health care system of this country			0
it 's why i 'd also like you to focus on the plight of the uninsured			0
in 2010 , the report said , the number of people in the @entity2 who lacked insurance for an entire year was 49.9 million			2
this is the largest number of people without insurance since the passage of @entity65 and @entity66			1
almost all of these people are below 65			0
( pretty much every @entity2 over 65 is on @entity65 , after all			0
the percentage of @entity2 who were covered by private health insurance decreased again -- to 64 % ; the number of people covered by employer - provided health insurance dropped to 55.3 %			1
where did all of these people go ? lots of them went to the government , as the number with @entity66 coverage increased to 15.9 % and those with @entity65 coverage increased to 14.5 %			1
unemployment is on the rise			0
more people are losing or unable to get private insurance , and turning to our safety nets for coverage			1
most of the benefits and improvements of the @entity96 -- the large @entity66 expansion , the exchanges , the mandate , the subsidies -- wo n't go into effect until 2014			1
( an early feature of the act that has already gone into effect has allowed hundreds of thousands of young people under 26 to remain on their parents ' insurance , and this group has fared better			2
) this is the truth we face as we talk about how to reform the health care system : some claim we need to depend on the private market more and more , but it 's shrinking and unable to cover those who need it			2
some want to cut @entity66 funding , but it 's responsible for covering more and more @entity2			1
it 's important to face reality			2
of the 75 million or so children in the @entity2 right now , more than one third are covered by @entity66 ; an additional 10 % or so are uninsured			1
when we talk about cutting @entity66 funding , we 're talking about making things worse for these children			1
there 's no getting around that			0
i know that there 's a deficit problem , and i know that it 's important to get a handle on entitlement spending			0
but we ca n't ignore that right now @entity66 is one of the cheapest insurance programs around			1
people seem to have forgotten , but the reason the @entity96 puts 20 million more people in @entity66 is that it was cheaper than putting them in the exchanges to get private insurance			1
moreover , about 5 % of @entity66 enrollees account for more than 50 % of all @entity66 spending			1
that spending is almost all on elderly and disabled people			0
it 's unlikely these people will be cut from @entity66			1
poor children ? poor adults ? far more likely			2
there will be hard decisions ahead			0
no one can deny that entitlement spending , especially health care spending , is unsustainable on its current path			0
we must be able to look at the budget and talk about areas where we might spend less			0
that will inevitably lead to some groups getting less than they did before			0
yet , as voting blocs and advocacy groups defend their piece of the pie , let 's not forget those who can not speak for themselves			0
the ranks of the poor are growing			2
they 're populated with children			0
and they depend on @entity66 for their health care in increasing numbers			1
let 's not sacrifice their future while we 're trying to save it for the rest of us			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			1

@entity181 says rising poverty numbers show one in five children *affected*
he says this reality must be faced when *deciding* how to save government money
he says more ca n't *afford* private insurance but must rely on @entity66 , which faces cuts
@entity181 : @entity193 on safety net is growing and we must *perserve* it
