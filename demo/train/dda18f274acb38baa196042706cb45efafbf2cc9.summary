@entity0 , @entity1 -- on tuesday , asteroid 2005 @entity3 is scheduled to pass near @entity4 , slightly closer than the moon			1
if you 've seen the " asteroid " ( 1997 ) or " @entity9 " ( 1998 ) movies , you know why people pay attention to what @entity13 calls " potentially hazardous objects " : a large asteroid hitting the @entity4 could cause global catastrophe			1
@entity3 will not hit the @entity4 anytime soon , certainly not in the next 100 years , according to @entity13 's @entity18			1
still , collisions of space rocks with the @entity4 must have happened many times over its 4.5 billion year history because the surface of the moon , our near sibling , is pitted with crater impacts left undisturbed by earthly weather , volcanoes , erosion or vegetation			1
follow space and science news on @entity35 @entity36 , a planetary scientist at @entity37 , estimates that asteroids the size of @entity3 come this close to the @entity4 about once every 100 years , and one this large hits the @entity4 only every few 100,000 years			1
2005 @entity3 ( its name derives from the year and month in which it was found ) is big compared to you and me but moderately sized for an asteroid , about 400 meters across ( four football fields ) , and very small compared to the @entity4 or the moon			1
let 's try a size analogy : if the @entity4 were a medium - sized house , the moon would be a large car about half a mile away ( nine football fields )			1
the asteroid would be a tiny pencil point dot ( like the thinnest lead you can buy for a mechanical pencil ) that never gets closer to the earth - house than about seven football fields away			2
this is much smaller than the asteroid reputed to have killed the dinosaurs and created the @entity65 near the @entity66			0
that asteroid was probably 25 times bigger across and more than 15,000 times bigger in volume			0
it was still small compared to the @entity4 or the moon -- about the size of your pinky fingernail in the house - car - pencil point analogy -- but big enough to wreak the global havoc of mass extinction			1
fortunately , large asteroids like the dinosaur - killing one 65 million years ago are very rare , so the chance of an impact from such an asteroid is quite small			1
in the late 1990s , @entity13 started a census of large asteroids -- larger than about 1000 meters ( 10 football fields ) across			0
that census is about 90 % complete , with some 900 known large asteroids and fewer than 100 not yet accounted for			0
none of the known asteroids is currently on a collision path with the @entity4			1
smaller asteroids are much more numerous , so even though they do n't individually cause as much damage , they are more likely to impact the @entity4			1
the chance of serious harm to the @entity4 depends on these two competing factors : how many and how big			2
the danger , as in the @entity98 story , comes from the middle , from asteroids small enough to be plentiful yet big enough to do damage			0
@entity3 is that " just right " size			0
a similar asteroid hitting @entity4 could seriously damage a city or cause a tsunami			1
if a large asteroid were found to be heading toward @entity4 , scientists and engineers have ideas about how to deflect it , perhaps using gravity or explosives			1
the farther away the asteroid , the smaller the change needed in its trajectory , and thus the easier it would be to avoid a collision			2
recent results from @entity13 's @entity121 infrared satellite suggest there are 20,000 space rocks with diameters between 100 meters and 1,000 meters			0
tracking these down will not be easy			0
it 's " like trying to detect a candle at the distance from the moon , " @entity126 , @entity121 project scientist , said in a press conference last month			0
nine years ago , @entity13 asked a team of scientists to make recommendations about how a census of smaller asteroids could be done			2
their report , issued in 2003 , estimated there are roughly 500,000 near - @entity4 objects with diameters of 50 to 100 meters ( comparable to one football field ) , with an estimated impact frequency of one every thousand years			2
scientists think the famous tunguska event of 1908 , an enormous explosion that flattened 80 million trees over 830 square miles ( 2/3 the size of @entity147 ) in @entity148 , was caused by an impact from an asteroid or meteorite about 50 to 100 meters in diameter			2
the force of this explosion was roughly 1,000 times larger than the nuclear bomb dropped on @entity155			0
the 2003 study recommended @entity13 search for potentially hazardous objects larger than about 140 meters across , or about 1/3 the size ( 1/9 the weight ) of @entity3			0
looking for smaller objects would be prohibitively expensive and would not result in a large gain in overall safety			0
however , stopping at 1,000 meters -- for which the present census is reasonably complete -- was deemed insufficient to protect the planet			0
searching for near - @entity4 asteroids can be done with telescopes on the ground and in space , observing at optical and infrared wavelengths ( like @entity121 )			1
in recent years , @entity174 has provided some funding for two sky - watching projects , @entity178 ( the first telescope has been deployed ) and @entity181 ( so far , in the design phase )			0
scientists know there is far more to asteroids than danger ; they are the material out of which the inner rocky planets in our solar system ( @entity4 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 ) formed			1
understanding the composition of asteroids , as well as their size distribution and shapes , yields important information that theories of planet formation have to explain			2
@entity3 is thought to be very black , as if it were made of carbon , like charcoal			0
because it is passing relatively nearby , the next few days will provide a gold mine of data for scientists			1
for them , especially , the porridge is not too hot , not too cold , but just right			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			2

a *midsized* asteroid will pass by @entity4 on tuesday
@entity209 : no need to worry about this one , but risk of asteroid collision is real
she says asteroids have collided with @entity4 and moon , sometimes *disastrously*
@entity209 : next few days will provide a gold mine of information for scientists
