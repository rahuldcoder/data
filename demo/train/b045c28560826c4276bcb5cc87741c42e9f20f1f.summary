-- desperate times call for desperate measures			0
after a humbling @entity8 defeat at the hands of lowly @entity10 , and with the reigning @entity12 champions a distant seventh in the @entity5 table , @entity6 have broken the bank to bring in @entity14 from @entity15			1
a club record fee of £ 37.1 million ( $ 61 million ) was confirmed by the club late saturday after the @entity18 passed a medical and agreed personal terms			1
the fee trumps £ 30.75 million ( $ 51 million ) that @entity6 paid @entity22 for @entity23 in 2008			2
@entity24 : how not to appoint a football manager in a statement released on @entity6 's official website @entity14 said : " i am thrilled to be joining @entity6			2
i have enjoyed some very happy years at @entity15 but the time has come for a new challenge			0
" @entity6 is the perfect place for me and i am excited at the chance i have to be part of the next phase in the club 's history			1
" @entity15 is a top club and i have many friends there but you can not turn down the chance to join @entity6			1
i look forward to helping the manager and the team be successful in the coming years			0
" manager @entity42 praised the 25 - year - old describing him as " one of the finest playmakers in the game today " while drawing attention to his impressive haul of 32 goals and 28 assists during his previous two seasons at @entity51			0
" i have been impressed with the excitement he has shown to be part of the new @entity6			0
i know our fans have admired @entity14 for some time now -- he has always played well against us -- and i know they will be delighted to see him in the red of @entity6 , starting on tuesday			1
" @entity14 's signing provides a much - needed fillip for a beleaguered @entity42 who is enduring a nightmare start to his @entity64 tenure			1
@entity42 , 50 , was the man chosen by the @entity6 hierarchy to replace @entity66 , the legendary @entity67 manager who retired in may after 26 years trophy - laden years at the helm having ensconced the club firmly at the pinnacle of domestic and @entity72 football			2
but elimination from both domestic cup competitions and a disastrous defence of the club 's league title -- @entity6 sits 14 points behind leaders @entity80 -- have exposed the weaknesses in @entity6 's squad and led to suggestions former @entity85 manager @entity42 ca n't cut it at football 's top table			1
@entity42 will be relieved to have finally secured the signature of a high - profile transfer target , following failed pursuits of star names such as @entity93 and a reported bid for @entity95 during the summer window			0
@entity6 's challenge has not been helped by injuries to key attackers @entity100 and @entity101 , with the latter casting a shadow over the early days of @entity42 ' by allegedly agitating for a move away from the club			2
the signing of @entity14 will bolster @entity6 's attack and the @entity109 playmaker will be hoping he can propel his new team into the latter stages of the @entity112 and , in the process , secure his place in @entity116 's squad for the @entity117 in @entity118			1
@entity6 's participation in next season 's @entity112 is in doubt , with the team six points off fourth place and the final qualification spot for @entity127 's elite competition			0
@entity42 ' decision to plunge into the january market is at odds with the philosophy of his illustrious predecessor			0
" buying in january has seldom been a route we have taken , " @entity66 said in december 2011			0
" unless a player we have always been interested in comes along ... it is not suitable for us			0
" @entity15 's decision to sell @entity14 has also been questioned			2
@entity14 has been voted @entity15 's @entity138 in each of the past two seasons , but he has found himself an increasingly peripheral figure since @entity142 's second spell as manager of the @entity51 club began in june			1
the former @entity146 player has started just 11 of @entity15 's 22 league matches , with @entity142 deeming @entity14 surplus to requirements in his bid to win a third @entity5 title with the @entity153 club			1
