-- @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 , and now @entity5 and @entity6			2
the decade - plus duration of @entity9 's confrontation with @entity10 offers lessons not only on how we battle extremist ideology but also how we should calibrate our expectations			1
the traditional goal in warfare is simple : defeat the adversary by destroying its will and capability to pose a threat			0
force the adversary to capitulate			0
with a nontraditional foe , it 's not clear that we need to limit ourselves to traditional measures of victory			2
we know by now that in no cases have the adversary 's radical ideology been defeated			2
the most striking successes , such as @entity34 's evisceration of the @entity36 organization and @entity39 forces ' push against @entity40 in @entity3 , have only limited the reach of @entity10 but failed to fully stem the flow of recruits to @entity45 affiliates or squelch the ideology that underpins its festering			1
we have too many reminders of the resilience of this particularly violent ideology to think that it can be eliminated			2
despite counterterrorism successes , @entity36 in @entity34 still lies dormant and remains potentially dangerous , as recent @entity34 arrests show			0
in @entity3 , @entity40 has been pushed out of large swaths of territory and its leader killed , but it is nowhere near finished in @entity58			0
@entity60 successes in @entity61 were stunning but have not come close to defeating @entity10 in the @entity62			0
despite these lessons , commentators across the political spectrum speak today about the defeat of an even larger , more geographically diverse , and more brutal adversary , in @entity5 and @entity6 , as if somehow the lessons of the durability of @entity45 ideology has proven brittle in other , equally complex , battlefields			1
we need to manage not just our expectations			0
our rhetoric , too , matters more than we think			0
when we declare that we will defeat @entity77 , what do we mean ? what is a sufficient condition to declare victory ? unless we define that condition , we risk involving ourselves in yet another unending conflict			1
we can not aim to eliminate @entity83 jihadism			2
not in one year or two , and probably not in one generation or two			0
the events of the past years -- both our combat in @entity6 and the instability ushered in by the @entity88 -- have created new grievances and vast ungoverned ( or ungovernable ) spaces in a region that is better armed than any other place on @entity93			0
there is a more modest way forward , though , and one that has proven successful without overreaching			0
how about rolling back @entity77 gains , confining it in and preventing the flow of fighters both into the battle area and back , as one goal ? yes , and that has already begun			1
simply showing to its local adversaries that @entity77 is n't invincible , that it folds under pressure , is an early win			1
and it is n't just @entity9 airpower that can accomplish this			0
@entity112 in @entity114 's outskirts , @entity111 in @entity5 , the @entity110 in northern @entity6 , have begun to push back and have had early successes			0
this will be a long , tough battle , but @entity77 has made too many enemies and has too few friends to succeed in the long term			1
truly degrading the @entity77 menace will involve eliminating the minds who manage the operation			1
the leaders , including not just @entity77 leader @entity126 , but also his so - called ministers , media advisers and field commanders , need to be killed or captured			1
most of their supporters , including @entity133 and @entity9 recruits to @entity5 and @entity6 , will die on the battlefield , but @entity45 's ideological sympathizers typically also turn their attention to building cells that can attack @entity139 targets , as we have witnessed in @entity34 , @entity4 and the tribal areas of @entity2			1
for that reason , selective , carefully targeted strikes in @entity5 will help decrease the risk here at home			0
elimination of every @entity77 leader and commander is too all encompassing a goal , and it 's unnecessary			1
we can take a page out of the @entity153 book by using the lessons of the standoff campaign against @entity45 's leadership remnants that has worked so successfully along the @entity2 - @entity1 border			1
were there @entity9 boots on the ground ? no. were the selective strikes effective ? absolutely			0
@entity2 's @entity153 region offers other important lessons			2
gains against the entrenched @entity45 network there did n't come overnight			1
likewise , @entity9 's years of engagement against key targets in @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 provide a blueprint			0
this new fight against @entity77 similarly will take patience , careful intelligence work , persistence and time			1
commitment to disrupting the group over time will eliminate the leaders who have the vision and capability to sponsor this kind of plotting			2
if we can find ways to keep those terror leaders on the run , that will shift their focus from plotting to survival			0
so , we should start the campaign with an achievable definition of victory and a reasonable expectation about what that will take			1
we want to degrade @entity77 so its ability to attack us and our interests is minimized , and to aid allies -- particularly @entity6 and @entity199 governments who are willing to commit even limited forces			1
we have to ensure that this does n't become @entity9 's war again			0
along with our allies , we want to free the people who now come under the cruel @entity77 boot			1
defeat of @entity77 may come			2
in the meantime , a good dose of degrade will be more than sufficient .			0

@entity210 , @entity211 : ideology - driven adversaries are hard to eliminate
@entity210 , @entity211 : our confrontation with @entity45 offers *strategies* on fighting @entity77
they say we need an achievable definition of victory , such as confining @entity77 gains
@entity210 , @entity211 : fight against @entity77 will take patience and careful intelligence work
