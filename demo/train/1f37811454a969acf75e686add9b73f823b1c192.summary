-- it 's fitting that @entity2 would be making political headlines the same month that reviews started tumbling in for the new book " @entity6 : why @entity7 became @entity8 "			1
both @entity2 and @entity7 are cautionary examples of what happens when journalists drop their skepticism to embrace a source who says what they want to hear			1
the @entity8 of " @entity19 " lore , revered by two generations of young reporters , was a shadowy but selfless g - man with intimate knowledge of the administration , who reluctantly but decisively chose to reveal corruption going all the way to the top of the @entity26 , out of a sense of decency and patriotism			0
what @entity30 reminds us in his new book is that @entity7 , who was outed as @entity8 in 2005 not long before his death , was motivated by the much baser impulse of wanting to get the @entity37 director fired so that he could take his place			0
in the process , @entity7 allegedly spread misinformation to @entity42 reporters and committed his own indecent and illegal abuses of power , including overseeing the burglarizing of various anti-war groups			0
you 'd think that @entity50 journalists would n't need reminding that sources have their own tawdry motivations for using the press , but when the subject is as important as the criminal venality of @entity56 -- or better yet the irreplaceable role of the fourth estate in safeguarding democracy -- then there is a disincentive to treat corroborators with the skepticism they deserve			0
it detracts from the story journalists want to tell			0
which brings us to @entity2			1
the @entity2 , as he was reliably referred to when his pronouncements were mostly limited to the financial pages , has become the general - interest media 's ( and president @entity72 's ) go - to billionaire for quotes , policy ideas , and other bon mots			1
why ? because he 's a rich dude who -- like his new fans -- wants his fellow rich dudes to pay more taxes			0
@entity2 has been making his crowd - pleasing calls to tax the rich for more than a decade now , but it was his 2006 announcement that he would give away most of his massive wealth -- or " claim checks on the activities of others in the future , " as he put it -- that triggered a journalistic standing ovation that shows no sign of abating			1
during the financial crisis in september 2008 and the ensuing wave of bipartisan bailouts , @entity2 was routinely treated as an almost impartial voice of wisdom and calm , advocating the @entity98 ( @entity98 ) , the stimulus , a mortgage - restructuring plan , and increased spending on high speed rail			1
left out of most press accounts : he profited enormously from every one of these programs			0
as @entity107 put it in a recent excerpt from his new book , " @entity110 , " @entity2 's @entity105 , beginning that fall , began buying up large chunks of @entity112 and @entity113 on extraordinarily favorable terms , in addition to its growing stakes in @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , and the @entity121			2
" all told , " @entity107 wrote , " @entity98 - assisted companies constituted a whopping 30 % of @entity2 's publicly disclosed stock portfolio			2
" as of july 2009 , @entity2 's investment in @entity112 alone had already netted him $ 2.5 billion			2
( @entity2 has objected to @entity107 's critique , pointing out in an interview with the @entity127 that @entity98 was passed after his investment in @entity112 and under the @entity130 administration which he said he did n't support : " anyone , he said , could have invested in banks or other stock based on statements by @entity137 chairman @entity136 that the @entity138 would ' do whatever it takes ' to help the ailing financial system			1
" ) earlier this month , an @entity72 administration foreclosure settlement increased the potential value of @entity2 's @entity118 holdings by $ 154 million in a single day			2
the man who has become the left 's favorite billionaire in the service of bashing plutocrats could be perceived as the single most successful crony capitalist in the country			0
this does not mean , as @entity154 gov. @entity153 said earlier this week , that @entity2 " should just write a check and shut up			1
" it 's a free country , and @entity2 's recommendations should ultimately be weighed on their own merits			2
but on that score , it 's worth noting that @entity2 has profited one hell of a lot more than the country that was supposed to benefit from all these @entity2 - approved bailouts and stimuli			2
he gets billions ; we get a big coulda - been - worse ! meanwhile , even the sitting treasury secretary acknowledges that the country 's fiscal trajectory is " unsustainable , " with no solution in sight to the bailout - exacerbated problems of debt and entitlement - commitments			0
i 'm not one who thinks that @entity2 needs to write a $ 10 billion check to the government in order to prove his policy sincerity			1
but it is worth noting that his big 2006 media breakthrough came not by pledging his fortune to the @entity183 , but to private charity			0
it 's clear which vehicle he finds the most effective use of his personal money			0
which suggests an ultimate test for raising the federal tax burden in a way pleasing to @entity2 , @entity72 , and most of the fourth estate : are we currently getting our $ 3.8 trillion worth of services ? has the rapidly increasing price tag of government -- from $ 1.9 trillion in @entity199 's last proposed budget -- come with a commensurate increase in quality ? if not , then we need to be cutting and improving government , not having it swallow up more of the private sector			1
if so , then that 's an argument the media should be having , instead of just uncritically high - fiving a billionaire with massive vested interests			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			0

@entity154 gov. @entity153 says @entity2 " should just write a check and shut up " about tax rates
@entity212 says the media tends to view @entity2 as a selfless sage on policy matters
he says the billionaire has a vested interest in many of the actions government takes
