it is spacious , contemporary and livable			0
there are stainless steel appliances , hardwood floors , and the bedrooms are painted a soothing green			1
stately columns convey " comfortable suburban			1
" a savvy realtor could market it as " @entity9 " model or " the retreat			0
" but when the owner of a super-energy efficient house in the @entity16 suburbs is the @entity18 government , you bet the name will leave you scratching your head			1
the welcome mat reads : " @entity22 , " or @entity23			0
built on the campus of a national technology testing site , the " @entity26 " is the nation 's newest science lab. government scientists and engineers will use the 2,700 square - foot home as a test - bed to develop ways to measure products , materials and systems that make a house energy efficient and green			1
they aim to demonstrate that an attractive home for a family of four can be " net - zero energy " -- meaning it produces as much energy annually as it consumes			1
" what we wanted to do was show that it 's possible to do in homes typical in size , with the aesthetics and features of a home in a metropolitan area , " said @entity44 , chief of the @entity46 's @entity45			1
buildings are an often overlooked part of the @entity18 quest for energy independence , @entity44 said			2
residential buildings consume 22 percent of the nation 's energy and commercial buildings eat up another 18 percent , he said			1
making homes more efficient , proponents say , will help reduce the country 's dependence on energy imports and cut greenhouse gases blamed for global warming			1
turning up the heat to drive down carbon emissions and energy bills @entity44 and other experts say that ways to measure systems in the complex environment of a home are lacking			1
their solution : this project			0
the " @entity87 " was built using commercially available products and constructed to exacting specifications to make it air and water tight			2
it bristles with state - of - the - art technology , including photovoltaic panels on the upper roof to convert sunlight to electricity and solar thermal panels on a lower roof to heat water			2
three types of geothermal systems use ground temperatures to heat the house in the winter or cool it in the summer			1
radiant heating is embedded in the floors			2
both conventional and high velocity duct systems distribute air			2
the house also has a " smart " electrical system			2
" i 'd love to live in this house			1
it has all the amenities , " @entity44 said , adding that it will be " extremely comfortable			0
" but who will actually live in it ? meet " the @entity115 " -- a " virtual family " scientists created to help simulate the impact of real people on the house			1
the " @entity115 " simulate two working adults and children , ages 14 and 8			0
devices in various rooms will mimic them , emitting heat and humidity at appropriate times , while sensors record conditions			0
" every movement of their lives has been scripted			0
lights will go on and off ; showers will take place , " said @entity44			0
" appliances will be turned on and off just as a family of four would use them			1
" " the reason they 're not real people is we want to have control , " he said			0
" with real people , we all live randomly , so it 's very difficult to have this control in place			1
" meanwhile , scientists in the detached garage will monitor conditions			0
@entity149 : can the @entity150 really go green ? approximately $ 2.5 million has been spent on the house using federal stimulus money			2
as a condition of the stimulus funds , almost all of the house was built using @entity18 materials and products			2
the lone exception -- a ventilation device in the basement -- was made in @entity162			0
no similar device is made in the @entity18 , the laboratory said			0
what will happen to the house once tests are completed ? " i do n't think that we 'll ever be finished with this facility , " said @entity44			0
he envisions new energy technology " for the next three or four decades			0
" and he suspects that the research will allow homebuilders to advertise a house 's energy efficiency			1
" buildings will have an energy label on them much as cars have a ' miles per gallon ' label today , " he said			0

stainless steel appliances , hardwood floors , and columns convey suburban comfort
' @entity26 ' is aimed at energy efficiency and is the nation 's newest science lab
a virtual family of four will ' live ' in the house and will test *climate* , water and other systems
