@entity0 is a tough place , something that 's especially so for its millions of poor , of course , but also for the country 's middle and upper classes , and foreign visitors			1
but no matter their status , everyone in the greater @entity11 area on january 12 , 2010 , was witness to unspeakable horror , when at least 200,000 died in a massive earthquake			1
tragically , much of the carnage resulted not from what was a large but still not catastrophic geologic event , but from widespread poverty and poor construction standards that turned entire blocks of buildings into death traps			2
and this week , as the country has been marking the anniversary of one of the most deadly disasters in human history , the grinding misery of the hemisphere 's poorest country is once again being reflected upon			2
there 's still plenty to think about			2
for a start , @entity0 still has the highest infant mortality and unemployment rates in the hemisphere , as well as the lowest life expectancy and daily income			1
compounding this problem is the persistent " brain drain , " which is seeing large numbers of the nation 's young and brightest -- a would - be middle class -- leave the country			2
meanwhile , there is political gridlock , which is hampering the ongoing recovery , with the continuing stalemate prompting the december resignation of another prime minister			1
still , despite the challenges , there are some signs of hope			2
for a start , the economy has been growing , helped by the current government 's focus on the tourism and education sectors			0
and despite continuing problems with widespread hunger as earthquake - related nongovernmental organizations continue to exit , agricultural reforms are making a difference			1
but perhaps one of the best reasons for optimism comes from the @entity73 people themselves			0
back in 1991 , novelist @entity74 published a book about @entity0 with the apt title @entity77 on @entity78			1
yet while the people of this troubled country will readily acknowledge the nightmare , they also manage to find much joy in their lives , and visitors often comment on the preponderance of broad smiles that seem so contradictory to the local circumstances			0
indeed , although poor , the nation has a beautiful landscape and long coastline , and is remarkably rich in traditions , culture , history and a mix of languages and connections to @entity98 , @entity99 , the @entity100 and elsewhere			0
history has shown repeatedly that people and nations can rise from disaster and experience unprecedented success			0
the @entity106 and the economic recovery of @entity108 after @entity109 come to mind , as does postwar @entity111			1
more recently , there has been the dramatic physical recovery of so many of the areas pounded by the 2004 @entity116 tsunami			1
so , how can we help the people of @entity0 ? of course , the support of the international community is essential , something that has been in evidence to an impressive degree in @entity0 , even acknowledging that numerous commitments were not fulfilled			1
but as the @entity128 crisis in @entity98 has shown , throwing resources into a hotspot is far from sufficient -- those wishing to help must consider the resources and capacities of the country in need to assist with the planning , execution and monitoring of help			0
affected peoples are always going to be a critical piece of determining what will work , so health and development interventions and investments must consider and defer to them from the start			0
after all , even the best ideas and innovations , especially those prepared at a desk thousands of miles away , wo n't be effective without strong local guidance			0
unfortunately , one of the critiques of @entity0 's recovery has been that well - meaning foreigners flooded in and imposed their ideas , too often ignoring locals ' wishes and ideas			1
still , two projects in post-earthquake @entity0 demonstrate how local input can be instrumental in producing results			1
for example , under the leadership of the @entity73 government , a range of partners have assisted with the annual distribution of effective , mostly donated drugs to help prevent the spread of four parasites that can cause disfiguring , disabling and even deadly tropical diseases			0
a critical aspect of the success of these efforts has been the @entity175 's use of local community leaders to organize , promote and distribute the drugs in their communities			0
indeed , with some training , promotional materials and a deep knowledge of their communities , the leaders ' success at engaging the participation of fellow villagers far surpassed expectations			0
as a result , during one nationwide campaign since the earthquake , drugs were delivered to an unprecedented 86 % of @entity0 's 10 million people -- no other recorded intervention in @entity0 appears to have encompassed so many residents			1
another project of note has been one working to fortify @entity73 salt with iodine for the first time , a life - changing public health intervention long used throughout much of the rest of the world			0
local marketing teams have managed to instill awareness among more than 80 % of salt purchasers of the iodized product			0
this measure is undertaken particularly with fetuses , infants and prepubescent teenagers in mind , and helps in the development of brain tissue -- a health benefit that will have a long lasting , positive impact on the country 's physical , educational and therefore economic health			0
five years after disaster struck , much remains to be done			1
but by working with the local community , a growing global economy and the steadfast spirit of the @entity73 people offer hope that this island will one day offer a recovery success story that will be remembered in the history books .			2
