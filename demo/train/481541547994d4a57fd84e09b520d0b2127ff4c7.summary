-- right now , @entity1 is @entity2			1
it 's not just " @entity4 , " on which he plays chemistry teacher - turned - meth mogul @entity5 , grabbing headlines as it hurtles toward its finale			1
it 's the sheer ubiquity of the actor , who 's proven himself to be versatile , good - humored and clamorously in demand			2
when rumors surfaced about the " @entity4 " star playing @entity17 in the next " @entity19 " movie , they created an instant internet firestorm -- and seemed utterly plausible			1
when @entity21 was looking for a " @entity29 " dance partner on his widely seen @entity24 tribute show , of course he chose @entity26 ( plucking him out of a @entity28 interview )			0
he appeared in recent episodes of " @entity31 " ( as @entity5 ) , " @entity32 " ( as @entity35 's physician , dr. fist ) and " @entity36			1
" he even made a guest appearance in @entity39 's parody of " @entity4			1
in the last two months alone , @entity1 's been covered with debris on the cover of @entity43 , looked dapper on the @entity44 and been the subject of a profile in @entity47			1
he 's on the stage			0
he 's starring in " all the way , " a play about @entity51 by the @entity53 winner @entity52 ( " @entity54 " )			0
producers are eyeing the play , which premiered in @entity57 this week , for a @entity59 run			0
he 's got two movies scheduled for this year , " @entity62 " and " @entity63			0
" last year he appeared in six : " @entity64 , " " @entity65 , " " @entity66 3 , " " @entity67 , " " @entity68 " and " @entity69			0
" all this @entity26 has n't gone unnoticed			0
when " @entity69 " director @entity71 requested @entity1 for the film two years ago , producer @entity70 quickly agreed			2
" yeah , we should , " he told @entity71			0
" we 're the only movie coming out next year that does n't have him in it			0
" too much @entity26 ? hardly			0
he 's known as a loyal friend and hardworking colleague -- and utterly unflappable			1
as writer @entity83 observed in his @entity44 profile , the writers of " @entity82 " frequently tried to throw @entity1 off balance			2
but @entity1 , as the show 's daffy dad , @entity86 , approached all manner of humiliation -- tighty - whities , bee attacks , nude roller - skating -- with the same casual steadiness he now brings to @entity5 ( though , admittedly , without the menace )			1
photos : memorable moments from ' @entity4 ' " @entity82 " was @entity1 's breakthrough , but he 'd been a regular visitor on tv screens for almost two decades			1
indeed , he was a familiar face even when his name was unknown , appearing in commercials for such brands as @entity107 's potato chips ( opposite @entity108 ) , @entity100 and @entity101 ( hey , it was a good living			0
) in his tv and movie roles , he generally appeared as authority figures : cops , soldiers and the like			0
he played two different astronauts in @entity117 productions : @entity118 in " @entity119 ! " and @entity120 in " @entity121 " and later " @entity122			0
" ( @entity1 and @entity117 share another connection : @entity1 's wife , @entity124 , was one of @entity126 's bridesmaids at her 1988 wedding to @entity117			2
) but @entity1 could show vulnerability when necessary			2
that 's what prompted " @entity4 " creator @entity131 to cast @entity1 as @entity5 in the first place			1
@entity131 , a former " x-files " writer , remembered a @entity26 performance in an " x-files " episode called " drive			0
" @entity1 's character was a bigoted creep , but the actor made him sympathetic			1
now he -- as the " @entity4 " catchphrase has it -- is the one who knocks			2
on sunday , @entity1 is up for his eighth @entity142 as an actor -- he'a had three nominations for " @entity82 " and five for " @entity4			1
" he 's won three times for his portrayal of @entity5 , and given the attention surrounding him , he 's the odds - on favorite for a fourth			1
he definitely has fans in his corner			0
" they need to rename the @entity142 the @entity26 , " wrote a commenter named @entity154 on @entity155			2
that probably wo n't happen -- but it does n't need to			0
the actor is secure in his work : currently shooting a new version of " @entity162 , " scheduled for next year , and ready for more if he wants it			2
it 's a far cry from the wounded @entity5 , who once lamented , " there was some perfect moment that passed me right by			1
" for the man named @entity1 , the perfect moment is right now .			1

with many projects , upcoming " @entity4 " finale , @entity1 is man of the moment
@entity1 is known as loyal friend , hardworking colleague , unflappable actor
the actor is favored to win an @entity142 for his portrayal of @entity5
