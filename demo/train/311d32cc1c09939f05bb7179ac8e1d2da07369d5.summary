in the automotive world , good things often come in fours			0
four doors , four - wheel drive and , in one corner of @entity6 , four of the planet 's finest motoring museums			1
and you do n't even need a car to visit them			2
@entity6 's premium motoring brands can be seen the world over , but only in @entity14 and @entity15 , where their manufacturers -- @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 -- have established the museums in their honor can their legacy be fully appreciated			1
between them , the collections based in a magic motoring triangle that connects the cities of @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 , are a priceless showcase of automotive history			1
the hundreds of cars , trucks and motorbikes on display range from the pioneering creations of @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 through to the futuristic prewar designs of @entity41 and on to the high - tech vehicles of the modern era			2
for car enthusiasts -- or simply anyone interested in the technology of modern transport , global brand values and remarkable architecture -- these state - of - the - art museums create a touring " golden triangle " that can be covered in a couple of days using @entity27 or @entity28 as a base			1
innovation , engineering excellence , historic achievement and a sense of style are some of the factors that exemplify the vehicles on display			0
@entity64 aluminum body an example is the first exhibit a visitor encounters at the @entity68 in @entity27 : the ethereal aluminum body shape of the 1939 @entity70			1
clearly the forerunner of all porsches , this tiny streamlined prototype was designed as a long - distance racing coupe by company founder @entity41			0
after @entity76 , it was the first car to carry the family name , ahead of the @entity20 no. 1			1
not far from the @entity70 is a car that began @entity20 's long association with the @entity82 24 - hour race in @entity83			1
in 1951 , a 1.1 liter @entity20 356 sl coupe bearing the number 46 competed in the race , winning its class and finishing 20th overall			1
between 1970 and 1987 , @entity20 was the outright winner 12 times at @entity82 , and added another four wins in the 1990s			1
the massive collection at the @entity93 , also in @entity27 , includes such historical masterpieces as the @entity95 of 1885 , the first @entity97 motor car of 1892 , the supercharged @entity19 roadsters of the 1920s and 1930s , through to the quirky high - speed transporter built to carry the @entity102 sports racer to the track			1
on one wall of the museum stands the 1939 six - wheeled @entity107 world record car , originally fitted with a 44 - liter v12 engine that was designed to reach a speed of 600 kilometers per hour ( 372 mph )			2
plans for a record attempt were undone by the advent of @entity76 ; the car was mothballed and its engine removed			2
@entity19 ' racing heritage is prominent , culminating in a spectacular lineup of its @entity118 grand prix and sports racing cars			1
outside the museum , a bronze statue depicts five - time world champion @entity123 driver @entity122 standing next to his 1954 @entity126 grand prix racer			0
@entity17 , created by engineer @entity39 in 1910 , consolidated its brand in 1932 when it joined with @entity129 and @entity130 to form @entity131 under the " four rings " emblem			0
flowing silver masterpiece examples of all these marques can be found at the @entity140 , along with @entity17 's @entity82 - winning sports racers , the @entity136 rally championship cars and the " @entity137 " @entity131 1000 @entity142 one highlight of the @entity17 display is a flowing silver masterpiece known as the 1937 @entity147 racing car			1
the car on show is a modern recreation of the @entity147 that @entity6 driver @entity152 took to a speed of more than 400 kmh on the @entity156 - @entity155 autobahn in october 1937 , the first time the mark was reached on a normal road			1
@entity152 was killed in 1938 during a similar speed attempt on the same road			0
in @entity28 , most people arrive by subway to @entity162 , which is a showroom and delivery center for its contemporary @entity18 , @entity166 and @entity167 brands			1
a pedestrian bridge links this with the silver bowl - shaped @entity170 across the road			0
the museum pays homage to the company 's aero engine origins and to its @entity123 racing endeavors with @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 , but primarily features a superb range of prewar and postwar @entity18 saloons , roadsters and coupes , along with its current crop of high - technology vehicles such as the i8 concept car			1
highlights include a roadster and coupe versions of the classic 1939 328 model , while curiosities such as the 1955 @entity194 bubble car enliven the display			2
between them , the four museums can easily soak up four days of visitor time , particularly if the factory tours are included			1
@entity27 or @entity28 makes a great base			1
they are two of @entity6 's most liveable and appealing cities -- easy on the eye , great transportation systems and not too expensive			1
the business - style hotel chain @entity206 , for example , offers rooms close to the main stations for € 60 to € 80 ( $ 80 - $ 107 ) outside peak season			0
if time permits , @entity6 's other great auto museum , @entity214 's sprawling @entity213 , lies 600 kilometers north of @entity28 in the city of @entity216 , about an hour by train west of @entity218			1
@entity28 to @entity218 takes about six hours by car or train			1
getting there @entity222 ( @entity222 ) train services link @entity28 and @entity27 in a little over two hours , while @entity29 is 40 minutes by train from @entity28			1
