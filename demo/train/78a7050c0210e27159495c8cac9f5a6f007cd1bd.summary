@entity13 , engineering , science , and technology ( @entity18 ) academy : welcome to @entity0 at @entity19			2
@entity20 student : today , we are very glad and appreciative of the teachers who are striving to make us the best and prepare us for a promising and productive future			1
@entity13 : and remember , we are accepting no excuses in our journey to be the @entity18 @entity26 , @entity27 : thanks to the students at @entity19 for getting things started today as @entity0 kicks off @entity31			1
let 's get to it			1
first up : @entity4 @entity36 @entity37 : first up , the @entity4 military is increasing its attacks on rebel forces , and at least one witness says it 's " like revenge			1
" this comes after a @entity45 airstrike reportedly killed part of @entity4 leader @entity48 's family			1
@entity48 has controlled @entity4 for 42 years			1
rebels want him out of power ; they 're fighting against his government and military			2
@entity45 , the @entity45 , is leading an international operation to protect @entity4 's citizens			1
@entity4 authorities say one of colonel @entity48 's sons and three of his grandchildren were killed in sunday 's airstrike			1
government officials say @entity48 and his wife were in the house when it was targeted , but that they 're all right			2
@entity45 says it does n't target individuals , just military - related locations			1
@entity45 commanders added that they regret any loss of life during @entity4 's ongoing civil war			1
pope @entity71 @entity37 : the late pope @entity73 can now be called " blessed , " which means he 's one step away from becoming a saint			1
the pope -- the position -- serves as the head of the @entity80			2
and @entity73 served as pope from 1978 until his death in 2005			2
in the catholic faith , in order to be beatified -- that 's when you 're declared as " blessed " -- a person has to be credited with performing a miracle			1
becoming a saint requires two miracles			2
some people have been critical of how @entity73 handled some issues in the @entity80 while he was pope			2
but more than a million people came out to the @entity5 on sunday for the beatification ceremony led by the current pope , @entity95			2
@entity73 performed more than 1,300 beatification ceremonies while he was pope , a very popular pope to this day			2
@entity98 @entity37 : their names are still @entity100 and @entity101 , but from now on , you can call them the @entity104 and @entity101			2
those are the titles that @entity106 's prince @entity100 and @entity101 were given after their royal wedding last friday			1
it was not what you 'd call a small ceremony			2
the couple tied the knot at @entity114 in front of family and friends			2
but people around the world tuned in to watch , and huge crowds showed up in @entity121 for a chance to see the bride and groom			2
they will be going on a honeymoon , although they are n't saying where			2
but they 're not leaving for a while			2
after a quiet weekend , prince @entity100 was headed back to his job as a search and rescue pilot			2
@entity130 @entity131 , mayor of @entity133 , @entity6 : my heart 's broken			1
there 's no way you can walk on these streets where i have grown up , and the 93,000 citizens that i represent , and see the pain in their eyes , the look of what has happened to us			1
this has clearly been a dark hour for me personally , and for our city			2
i believe that we will come out of this stronger , and a new day will dawn for the city of @entity133			2
@entity150 @entity37 : the mayor of @entity133 , @entity6			1
his city was hit hard by severe weather and tornadoes that whipped across the southern @entity155 last week			0
churches across the state of @entity6 held a day of prayer yesterday for the victims and survivors			1
authorities say more than 330 people were killed across six states ; that made it the second deadliest tornado outbreak in @entity155 history			0
president @entity168 went to see some of the damage in @entity133 on friday			0
he declared major disasters in parts of @entity6 , @entity172 and @entity173			1
that declaration will give money to help with the recovery efforts			0
weather anchor @entity178 was also in @entity133			0
he gives us a closer look at what the president saw			0
( begin video ) @entity178 , @entity184 : this is @entity6			1
it 's my home state , the heart of @entity189 , and after suffering the worst tornado in its history , this place will never quite be the same			1
when it comes to damage , it 's so incredibly random			1
one house will have a wall completely ripped away , part of a roof			0
this one , on the other side of these trees , was actually lifted up and pushed completely off its foundation			0
and then right across the street on this side there 's nothing there			1
now , before the twisters struck , this truck was in perfect condition			0
but after experiencing winds , possibly as high as 300 miles per hour , this vehicle has been reduced to rubble			0
and since this story began , we 've been down countless streets , been in many neighborhoods , and still , we 're seeing the same stuff			0
near and far , there 's just destruction			1
from houses to trees , just devastation			1
here in @entity133 though , things are slowly getting back to normal			0
you look across @entity227 and you see some construction crews trying to put things back together			0
all around them , plenty of damage			0
but things like that can get fixed			0
for the people who lost loved ones , though , life will never be the same			0
( @entity238 ) shuttle @entity239 @entity37 : this is not where @entity242 is supposed to be right now			0
the shuttle was supposed to launch last friday			0
@entity245 called that off because of concerns about the heating system			0
next possibility was today , but that 's off too			1
a power problem is what 's causing the other delay			1
the @entity242 crew and support staff were allowed to go home			0
officials have n't set a new launch date , but they say it wo n't be any earlier than next sunday , may 8th			0
@entity260 @entity261 , @entity27 : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs. @entity264 's class at @entity265 in @entity266 , @entity267 ! what is this person operating ? you know what to do ! is it a : a ) @entity276 , b ) steadicam , c ) teleprompter or @entity277 ) boom mic ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! this is a @entity280 , which helps eliminate shaking for hand - held cameras			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! career connections @entity37 : we 're putting the @entity280 in focus today because our @entity285 segment is back ! our own @entity289 is here to give you the scoop			1
@entity289 ? @entity292 , @entity27 : well , the title pretty much speaks for itself ! we 're trying to help you connect with careers that interest you			0
@entity33 , what gave you the desire to become an anchor ? @entity37 : uh , i was a better talker than listener			0
@entity302 : well , @entity0 's @entity303 knew he wanted to be a professional cameraman from the time he was young , like middle - high school age			1
he learned a lot from the work of @entity308 , who invented the @entity280 in the 1970s			1
and now , he 's following in @entity308 's footsteps			1
( begin video ) @entity311 , @entity312 : a good operator makes @entity280 look good			1
@entity314 , @entity0 anchor : the breakdown is a monumental shutdown			0
@entity318 : @entity280 was originally designed for film			1
basically , it 's a vest that has an arm that comes around			1
and i attach this arm that has springs loaded into it			0
the camera attaches to it			0
the springs take out all the load of the camera and me walking around , so it balances it out ; makes it nice and smooth			0
we have two minutes until we are live			0
right now , we 're in the middle of a break and i 'm getting time cues in my ear from master control			0
unidentified @entity0 director : her mic			0
@entity342 , @entity343 : you are at the international desk , where we bring you the world up to the minute			0
unidentified @entity0 director : go @entity348 them			0
@entity318 : so , the director is telling me , " @entity303 , i need this shot			0
" and then he 'll explain whatever shot it is , either the anchor at a wall or i 'm doing a bump shot			0
and all a bump shot is is just a beauty shot of the studio			0
unidentified @entity0 director : go ! standby to bump everything down , please			0
@entity318 : well , that 's what happens when the president takes over : our shot gets killed			1
no big deal ; happens every day			0
the best advice i was given is to volunteer and always ask questions if you do n't understand what something is			1
( @entity238 ) before we go @entity37 : well , you heard @entity303 , a friend of mine , talk about directors a lot			0
you can watch our @entity285 segment on directors at @entity381 ! well , we hope you saved enough room for today 's before we go segment , because it is gon na leave you stuffed			1
between the tomato , cucumber , lettuce and bread , you 're looking at a five pound burger ! and more than three pounds of that is meat			0
a restaurant in @entity392 offers its diners a challenge : if they can get it down in 2 hours , the burger 's free			1
free food versus massive heartburn ? goodbye @entity37 : there 's a debate you can really sink your teeth into			1
and you knew it could only show up in our beef - fore we go segment			2
there 's an a-bun - dance of puns we could make about this story , but we 've already eaten up all of our time			2
just one more thing : this show goes out to our friends at @entity414 in @entity415 , @entity416			0
