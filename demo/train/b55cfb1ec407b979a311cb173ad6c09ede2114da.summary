a jury awarded a 92 - year - old man $ 1.9 million in compensatory damages for the death of his wife			1
the jury of five women and one man deliberated for slightly more than a day before deciding on the amount , attorneys for both sides said			2
the jurors put the total award at $ 5.3 million but found that @entity22 was only 36.5 percent responsible for the lung cancer that plaintiffs said killed @entity26 's wife			1
@entity28 herself was deemed 63.5 percent responsible , the attorneys said			1
@entity31 's attorney @entity30 said the jury found a design defect and a breach of warranty			2
@entity22 announced that it plans to appeal the case , one of thousands of " @entity45 progeny " cases , named after a 2006 @entity3 @entity41 decision that decertified a class - action lawsuit against the tobacco industry			1
that case involved dr. @entity45 , a @entity46 pediatrician and smoker who served as the lead plaintiff in the class - action suit			0
the decertification decision let former class members file lawsuits individually , and thousands did			0
the @entity3 @entity41 also allowed some factual findings about smoking causing disease be taken from @entity45 case and applied to the progeny cases " so plaintiff 's attorneys do n't have to start from square one in each of these cases , " said @entity58 , a lawyer for the @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61			2
the industry has balked at that			0
" today 's verdict is the result of a severely prejudicial trial plan , " said @entity68 , @entity69 senior vice president and associate general counsel , speaking on behalf of @entity22 , in a written statement			1
" from beginning to end , this case was marked by legal rulings that should be reversed on appeal , including allowing this jury to rely almost exclusively on findings by a prior jury that have no direct connection with the plaintiff in this case			0
" so far , six of the eight @entity86 cases that have gone to trial have come back with a plaintiff 's verdict , said @entity58			0
" another bunch are in the pipeline ready for trial this year , " he said			0
about thursday 's verdict , he said , " this is certainly a clear indication that tobacco litigation is alive and well			1
" @entity30 said his firm has more than 150 @entity86 cases			0
" we 're more than happy to keep trying them , " he said .			0
