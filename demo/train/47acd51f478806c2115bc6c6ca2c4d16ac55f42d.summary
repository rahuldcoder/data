-- thirteen years after putting on the adamantium claws , @entity1 is still carving up the box office as the most iconic super-mutant , @entity5			1
since opening on july 26 , @entity5 , @entity1 's fifth outing as the ornery x-man , has grossed $ 307 million worldwide			1
it 's not exactly @entity11 money , but it 's more than enough for @entity13 to want to keep @entity1 in the @entity15 fold			2
as the @entity5 's post-credit sequence teased , @entity1 will time - travel for a cameo in next year 's x-men : @entity19			1
but will that be the end of @entity1 's run ? the 44 - year - old has played @entity5 longer and more frequently than any actor has ever been associated with a comic - book hero , but his current deal is about to expire			1
now the @entity26 claims that @entity13 is offering @entity1 $ 100 million for him to keep slicing and dicing for four more x-men movies			1
them 's a lot of chicken breasts ! @entity1 's spokesperson dismissed the report , but the future of @entity5 is worth some analysis , from both @entity1 's and the franchise 's points of view			1
the @entity39 actor , who earned his first @entity41 nomination for last year 's @entity42 , has n't made any @entity44 - like comments about returning to the character			2
when he spoke to @entity0 earlier this year , he was noncommittal , but the door was certainly open : " i 'm not sure			0
i was n't even sure after the first [ stand - alone ] film if i would do another			0
i wo n't say never , because i 'm still loving it			0
but there would have to be a pretty compelling reason			0
" that " pretty compelling reason " might be introducing @entity5 to some new super-friends , like the @entity11			2
the razor - sharp comic - book character first appeared in a 1974 @entity54 comic and he later joined forces with the @entity11 in print			0
the only thing standing in the way of some x-men / @entity11 movie synergy is studio politics			0
( @entity13 licenses the @entity15 characters from @entity63 , which is now owned by @entity64			0
) when asked recently about that crossover opportunity by @entity66 , @entity1 was more than enthusiastic , claiming that he 'd even inquired to @entity63 about that possibility			2
" i understand at @entity63 they 've got @entity11 , they 've got a lot of big things going on , but at some point i just find it almost impossible that there 's not a way to bring @entity77 , all the @entity11 characters , @entity5 , the @entity15 characters , @entity74 , and somehow get them in together , " he said			2
" i 'm in for it , i 'm totally up for it because i think that would be really exciting for fans across the board			0
" @entity0 : @entity1 on what it 's like being at @entity85 playing @entity5 does come at a cost , however			1
first , there 's the physical demands that require @entity1 to be incredibly jacked			2
it looks great for this particular superhero role , but not every character he plays needs to be so shredded			0
in fact , being so buff might disqualify him from certain movie parts			0
when the @entity5 was temporarily shelved after director @entity94 left the project in 2011 , @entity1 expressed some frustration because his body was primed for one role only at that moment			1
re-upping for another movie — or four — means more chicken - heavy diets and multiple daily trips to the gym			0
the other cost is time			0
the x-men movies are huge productions that block out months of an actor 's calendar			0
making another long - term commitment to the franchise also means saying no to other , slightly more nuanced characters that come down the pike			0
and as a capital - a actor , @entity1 is in his prime , at the perfect leading - man age when glorious good looks are knocked slightly askew by just the right weight of world - weariness			1
since joining the @entity15 , he 's mixed in a few interesting performances — the @entity120 , @entity121 — but you ca n't help but wonder about all the roles he had to turn down because @entity124 had to be fed. ( psst , @entity125 and @entity126 ... ) @entity13 will certainly make it worth his while , but does @entity1 really want to be 49 or 50 and giving a variation of the same @entity5 interview where he 's describing his calorie intake ? from @entity13 's point of view , though , extending @entity1 for additional films is a no - brainer			1
as the @entity5 producer @entity135 said , the idea of eventually replacing @entity1 , or perhaps rebooting the franchise with a new actor " feels somewhat blasphemous			1
" @entity5 existed in the pages of @entity63 comics and the imaginations of fans everywhere , but @entity1 is @entity5			1
it 's a cinematic character he created , and like @entity145 and @entity77 , it 's now impossible to imagine one without the other			0
of course , @entity5 is an immortal of sorts who is n't supposed to age ; @entity1 , despite all evidence to the contrary , does n't have that ability			1
at some point , @entity13 could ask , " are we running the risk of our @entity5 being the equivalent of @entity159 's @entity158 in @entity156 ? " but times have changed ; look no further than @entity145 , who will be 50 when @entity11 2 comes out in 2015			2
i ca n't imagine @entity1 would get soft around the middle ; besides a more grizzled @entity1 better suits the haunted comic - book character			2
the big headline yesterday was the $ 100 million figure that the @entity26 threw out there			1
it may have been conjured out of thin air , but it 's not a ridiculous amount			0
in fact , i 'd argue that @entity1 as @entity5 for four more x-men movies is worth every penny to @entity13			1
there might be some sticker shock to the $ 100 million figure , but paying the star of am established superhero franchise $ 25 million per picture is hardly unprecedented			1
( @entity145 famously took home $ 50 million for @entity11			2
) in fact , compared to the reports of what @entity182 is going to throw at @entity44 to return as @entity184 , $ 25 million per for more @entity1 almost seems like a discount			1
best of both worlds , i 'd like to see @entity1 return as @entity5 — but just once more , maybe twice			1
one more big @entity15 movie , and then an @entity11 crossover that could pit him opposite @entity145 's @entity77			0
let those two actors ride off into the sunset together			0
a four - film commitment on movies of this magnitude , on the other hand , has a way of stretching over another decade , and @entity1 is too talented an actor to have 20 years of his prime dominated by a cartoon character , no matter how iconic			1

" @entity5 " has grossed $ 307 million worldwide
@entity1 would have to train his body for more films
there is *speculation* the actor could snag $ 100 million for the role
