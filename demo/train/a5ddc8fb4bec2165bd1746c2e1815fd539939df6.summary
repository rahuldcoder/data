-- it 's a lot more difficult than you might think to find good parents in fiction : perhaps unsurprisingly , a lot of fiction deals either with the lack of a parent -- being a cardinal rule of children 's fiction to ditch the parents -- or a parent 's complete unsuitability for the role			1
but there are a few out there , parents who make you think , " @entity21 , i wish my parents were like that			1
" here 's our totally comprehensive , really scientific overview of good parenting in fiction : 1			1
@entity27 -- " @entity28 " by @entity29 the widowed father of @entity31 and @entity32 , @entity27 is one of the great heroes of @entity35 literature			1
steering his young children along the path of moral rectitude is hard in the @entity39 , and when @entity41 , a lawyer , unsuccessfully defends an innocent black man from charges that he raped a white woman , it becomes even more difficult			1
but his own belief in rightness , morality , and good , even in the face of an unfair world , is communicated to his kids -- and to the world			1
his impact on the legal profession , especially in the @entity39 , was also profound : the @entity55 , part of the @entity57 , was founded to serve the legal needs of the poor and named after a fictional lawyer who " epitomizes the type of professional , and person , lawyers strive to be			1
@entity64 and @entity63 -- " @entity65 " by @entity66 tesseracts are real and @entity68 and @entity70 's scientist father has disappeared into one -- it 's up to these two brilliant but socially awkward children to save him			1
when it was published in 1962 , " a wrinkle in @entity81 " was a sci - fi gift to all those nerdy kids out there for whom " @entity79 " had n't been invented yet			2
and the @entity70 parents -- beautiful and smart microbiologist @entity63 and tesseract physicist @entity64 -- made being scientists seem so cool			1
who would n't want parents like that ? 3			1
the @entity89 -- " @entity91 " series by @entity90 @entity91 wanted them to adopt him -- and we would n't mind either			0
though @entity91 was already remarkably well - adjusted for a child who 'd been forced to sleep in the spider - filled cupboard under the stairs , his friendship with @entity96 and his family showed him what a loving family really looked like			1
@entity104 was kind , fiercely protective of her children -- her battle with @entity108 in the final book was immensely satisfying -- and knits a mean jumper			2
@entity111 was slightly bumbling , loves @entity113 stuff , and still a kid at heart			0
best of all , they loved each other as much as they loved their children			2
@entity0 : 10 things you might not know about @entity91 4			0
marmee -- " @entity121 " by @entity122 marmee is the glue that holds the " @entity121 " together through the @entity125 and their father 's long absence			0
kind and charitable , she 's their moral compass , their comfort in troubled times			0
without her , the four girls , @entity135 , @entity68 , @entity136 and @entity121 , are lost			0
mr. and mrs. little -- " @entity140 " by @entity139 interspecies procreation is typically cause for concern , but not for mr. and mrs. little			1
when their son , @entity147 , was born a mouse , the kind , though perhaps a bit dense , @entity146 treated him just like any other member of the family			0
a member of the family who had a long tail , whiskers , slept in a cigarette box and could climb up lamp cords			0
@entity160 and @entity161 -- " @entity162 " by @entity163 though @entity163 's stories of growing up in the @entity166 , now @entity167 , in the mid to late 19th century are actually autobiographical , the books tend to be found in the children 's fiction part of the bookstore , so they make the list			1
@entity161 was a true pioneer with a serious case of wanderlust : he could build a house by hand and skin a rabbit , but still remained a gentleman , kind , courteous and upstanding			0
@entity181 , a true pioneer 's wife , instructed her children to treat others with care			2
mr. and mrs. @entity187 -- " @entity191 " series by @entity190 @entity192 , age 8 , is a bit of a handful			1
her imagination -- and she 's got lots of it -- often gets her into situations , like the time she went to school with her pajamas under her clothes because she was pretending to be a fireman			0
or the time she put her doll in the oven			0
or the time she squeezed an entire tube of toothpaste into the sink			0
her parents , @entity211 and @entity212 , meanwhile , are real parents , who have to deal with real things like quitting smoking , having children young , getting laid off , and 8 - year - olds who accidentally dye themselves blue			1
and they even get in fights , like real parents do			1
but throughout it all , they manage to remain patient and affectionate with their children ; they 're not perfect , but they 're pretty good			1
@entity221 and @entity222 -- " @entity223 " by @entity224 when brother and sister @entity221 and @entity222 of the @entity228 farm decide to adopt a boy from a @entity231 orphanage to help out around the farm , they were n't expecting @entity233			0
@entity233 ( with an ' e ' , of course , since it 's ever so much more distinguished ) was a redheaded 11 - year - old , covered in freckles and though extremely clever , sometimes a bit too imaginative , definitely melodramatic and possessing an almost magnetic attraction to getting into scrapes			0
shy @entity221 immediately loves @entity233 , enchanted by her incessant chatter and her creativity , while @entity222 , strict and somewhat prim , takes awhile to warm up			0
but when she does , her devotion to @entity233 is unparalleled and she keeps the sometimes flighty redhead on firm ground			0
@entity0 : all about @entity233 ( of @entity228 ) 9			0
@entity247 , @entity248 the @entity249 , and the wolves -- " @entity251 " by @entity252 after they save him from becoming tiger @entity257 's meal , @entity253 and @entity254 raise the hairless man - cub mowgli as one of their own			0
but it 's up to @entity247 the sleepy bear and @entity248 the panther to teach the boy the @entity265 -- thereby becoming the coolest godparents in the world			1
the @entity268 -- " @entity270 " by @entity271 , and @entity269 so , the @entity268 were actual people , not fiction , and this charming book , published in 1948 , is a biography written by their children			1
but -- and we mean this as a compliment -- the parents are so lovely as to almost seem made up			2
@entity280 and his wife , @entity281 , are world - famous efficiency experts whose studies in time and motion changed the way people worked			0
if @entity271 had his way , it would have also changed the way people raised children , especially after their incredible fecundity produced 12 children			2
having an even dozen children meant that the @entity268 could apply some of their expertise in their @entity296 , @entity297 , home			2
hilarity ensues , as does an overwhelming sense of warmth and happiness			0
the two children wrote a follow up book , " @entity309 , " recounting what happened after @entity271 's death in 1924 , which left @entity281 with house full of children , the youngest just 2 years old , and a business to run			2
mother @entity281 manages to keep it all together , with good humor and warmth , and the book manages to stay away from the maudlin			2
