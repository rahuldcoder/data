@entity0 , @entity1 -- a federal appeals court ruled tuesday that federal investigators ' seizure of drug - test results of more than 90 major league baseball players five years ago was illegal			1
@entity8 has admitted using a " banned substance " during the 2001 - 2003 seasons			0
the decision recommended new guidelines for computer searches to prevent investigators from using information about people who are not named in a search warrant but whose private data is stored on a computer being searched			1
investigators looking into steroid use by professional baseball players obtained search warrants and subpoenas for the drug tests results on 10 major league players , but they took the results on 104 players			1
the @entity29 sued for the return of the seized results , while the government argued investigators should be able to use them since they were " in plain sight " along with the other results during the search			2
the appeals court 's decision says such a standard for computer searches would be dangerous to everyone 's privacy as protected by the @entity43 's @entity42			1
" seizure of , for example , @entity47 's e-mail servers to look for a few incriminating messages could jeopardize the privacy of millions , " wrote the 9th @entity45 judges			2
the judges noted that " some players appear to have already suffered this very harm as a result of the government 's seizure			0
" the decision referred to news reports published earlier this summer that quoted " lawyers with knowledge of the results " saying that players @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity8 and @entity65 were among those testing positive for performance - enhancing drugs			2
@entity8 has admitted using a " banned substance " during the 2001 - 2003 seasons			0
the tests were conducted in 2003 under a collective bargaining agreement between @entity29 and the players ' union			0
" urine samples were to be collected during the first year of the agreement and each sample was to be tested for banned substances , " the court said			0
" the players were assured that the results would remain anonymous and confidential ; the purpose of the testing was solely to determine whether more than five percent of players tested positive , in which case there would be additional testing in future seasons			0
" the test results were taken in 2004 during searches in @entity1 and @entity90 -- the company that kept the results -- and another company that stored the urine samples .			1
