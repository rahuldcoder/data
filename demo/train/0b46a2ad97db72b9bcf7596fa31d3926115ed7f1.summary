-- an olympic gold medal is no guarantee of subsequent success as a professional boxer , but it meant the world for @entity6			1
however , that did not stop the @entity8 from selling the coveted super heavyweight prize he won 16 years ago at the @entity11			1
" it was absolutely a highlight in my life and also a highlight for the country because @entity8 in 1996 for the first time traveled to the @entity18 as an independent country , " the 36 - year - old told @entity0			1
" we collected a lot of medals and we got ninth place worldwide , so we got in the top 10 , which was a great achievement by the athletes			0
" @entity6 will attend friday 's glittering opening ceremony for @entity28 as the holder of four of the five recognized heavyweight belts			2
unlike his @entity18 successor , @entity33 's @entity32 champion @entity31 , he has a formidable record in professional boxing , winning 58 of his 61 fights -- 51 by knockout			0
video : @entity40 's boxing master class he and his brother @entity41 -- who holds the heavyweight division 's other title , the @entity45 belt -- have dominated the elite class for the last five years			2
but it was one of their many interests outside the ring that convinced @entity6 to auction off his gold medal -- so the proceeds could boost the coffers of the charitable foundation they set up the same year he fought his way to @entity18 glory			1
" i did sell the medal in march and 100 % of the funds , which is $ 1 million , went to the @entity64 -- we care about education and sport , that is the key in any children 's life , " @entity6 said			1
" if they have knowledge they can succeed with that in their adult life and sport gives them the rules -- how to respect your opponent , how to respect the rules			0
" it is always in life like that , you go down but you have to get up , and sport gives you this great lesson			0
" @entity87 vs. @entity88 ? that 's just handbags - watch the women at the @entity18 @entity6 's most recent defense of his quartet of titles came against @entity95 @entity94 in @entity96 two weeks ago , when the @entity8 stopped his 40 - year - old opponent in the sixth round			1
and though he has penciled in another fight before the end of this year , @entity6 has yet to secure an opponent			1
" i 'm a seasoned fighter and that means i have to stay busy , so i fought twice this year and by the end of the year -- november , december -- i 'm going to defend my titles again , " he said			0
" i do n't know who is going to be the next opponent because i just fought recently			0
" one of @entity6 's most recent victories came against former heavyweight champion @entity87 in @entity107 last year , and though the @entity108 retired after the fight he recently returned to the ring to beat compatriot @entity88			1
@entity87 has repeatedly said he wants to fight @entity41 , but @entity6 would n't be drawn on whether the pair would finally square off in the ring , saying his brother 's political ambitions would be his main focus after his bout against @entity117			2
" it 's very difficult to follow the wishes of @entity87 -- he 's going to fight @entity41 then he 's not , he 's retired then he 's not , " @entity6 said			2
" there is a lot of controversy back and forth , and to make it clear @entity41 is going to defend his @entity45 title in @entity125 on september 8 against @entity117 and we ca n't look beyond that			0
" @entity128 of all he has to win the fight , then he 's going to have parliamentary elections because @entity41 is a politician			0
" he 's hopefully going to get enough percentage and pass the line to get to the parliament of @entity8 , so then we 'll see how it goes with @entity87 and the fight			0

@entity6 tells @entity0 his gold at the @entity11 is one of his career highlights
current @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity145 champ took gold in the super heavyweight division in 1996
the 36 - year - old auctioned his medal for $ 1 million to help his charitable foundation
@entity6 says he will fight again before the end of this year
