@entity0 -- having to skip cancer therapy twice in the last two months due to a lack of drugs normally available through @entity7 's national health system , 45 - year - old @entity2 says a new fear has entered her life			1
" i have been battling cancer for the last six years			0
now i ca n't find the drugs i need			2
ensuring i get my treatment every two weeks is a matter of life and death for me			2
" @entity2 is one of thousands of @entity16 trapped in a vicious circle involving a cash - strapped government unable to pay its bills			1
she spoke as some international pharmaceutical companies have limited supplies to @entity7 , and increased fears of a parallel export trade as wholesalers and pharmacies look for cash			1
diagnosed as the sick man of @entity28 , @entity7 is in its sixth year of recession and hugely in debt , struggling to put its finances in order			1
while servicing a massive bailout loan to its lenders , the @entity35 , the @entity36 and the @entity37 , the state owes pharmaceutical companies and pharmacies around 2 billion euros ( $ 2.6 billion ) through accumulated debt , health minister @entity33 admits			1
the president of @entity7 's @entity43 , @entity44 , who is also the vice president of @entity7 , warns that " companies are heading towards a dead end			1
it is impossible to run a business when there is no cash flow to plan ahead			0
" there are legal limitations to ensure that drugs can not be treated like any other commodity : pharmaceutical companies are legally bound to continue to supply hospitals with so called " critical medicines , " which include those dealing with life - threatening diseases such as @entity60			1
but patients and @entity62 , including @entity63 , which supports women with breast cancer , said they receive calls on their helplines from panic - stricken people who ca n't get hold of the medicines they need			2
what really went wrong in @entity7 ? under the current @entity16 system , customers can buy some critical medicines from pharmacies and are later reimbursed by the state			1
at state pharmacies and hospitals they can get the medicines directly			0
this means poorer customers are " guaranteed " immediate access to " critical " drugs , but if there are shortages at state pharmacies and hospitals then this excludes access for people who ca n't pay upfront			2
thirteen companies have been investigated , with eight of those found to have reduced supplies , according to the national drug regulator 's president @entity96			1
the firms involved have yet to be identified , but the list is understood to include large multinational corporations ; they are expected to face heavy fines , @entity96 said			2
@entity102 estimates shortages of 200 medicines out of a total of 12,500 available in @entity7			1
an export ban on 60 drugs has been issued to ensure a sufficient supply in the internal market			2
@entity111 spokesperson @entity110 said the company is withholding some non-critical drugs until it is paid the 200 million euros it is owed by the @entity16 state			1
" we are insisting that the public hospitals fulfill their contracts and this is something we do in any country , " he said			0
" we are withholding medicines until they meet their obligations			0
" @entity7 has among the cheapest medicines in the @entity35 and has just announced further price drops			1
this makes drugs more affordable at a time when a rising number of unemployed @entity16 have lost their health - care coverage but it comes with side - effects : supply problems , and an increase in " parallel export trade			1
" after years of mismanagement and overspending the health ministry is under pressure to make cuts to the social funds which cover the cost of most drugs			2
@entity140 , general secretary of the @entity141 , described the new price list as " infuriating			0
" " some prices are artificially low to show expenditure cuts to @entity7 's lenders , " @entity143 said			1
" the move could push pharmaceuticals to further reduce supplies to @entity7 because of low profits			1
the companies only care about money , not people			2
" " the low prices mean that it is about three times cheaper to buy a box of aspirin in @entity7 than it is in @entity160 " , said chemist @entity154 , " but it increases parallel trade			1
" wholesalers are legally allowed to sell medicines to other @entity28 countries , including at higher prices , as long as they can guarantee sufficient supply for the @entity16 market for three months			1
but increasingly wholesalers , and sometimes pharmacies , break the rules and sell larger quantities than they are allowed to other @entity35 markets in search of a quick profit			0
as cash becomes scarcer in @entity7 , more and more people turn to this kind of trade			1
" the state is so late with our payments so we keep delaying payments to wholesalers , " says @entity154			0
" but increasingly they no longer accept credit			0
and we do the same			0
all transactions of goods are now upfront , so people have to look outside @entity7 because there is no money here			1
" deputy health minister @entity192 said the current shortage of medicines in the @entity16 market is artificial			1
@entity192 blamed wholesalers and pharmacies for exporting large quantities of drugs destined for @entity16 to wealthier @entity35 countries to increase profit			1
this parallel trade has long been an issue			0
it is a fundamental problem of any free trade area , such as the @entity35 , where movement of goods is not only legal but encouraged			0
@entity7 is a poorer country , and medicines there have always cost less so wholesalers have always sold them for more outside the country			1
this is also the case with @entity213 and generally the countries of the south			0
and what is happening in the health sector is indicative of what is happening in all facets of @entity16 life			1
the country is turning into a cash economy			0
with no money to go around @entity16 now face shortages and despair			2
paying for the drugs herself , even in cases of emergency , is not a viable option for patients like @entity2 , who works in education in the public sector			2
with her cancer treatment costing 2,500 euros a month -- but a gross monthly salary of just under half of that -- it is impossible for her to cover her medical bills			0
" my husband and i also have two children to support			0
his business as a fishmonger has also dropped because of the financial crisis as people eat less fresh fish to save money			0
" in the center of @entity0 , in one of a handful of state pharmacies , people are looking for prescription drugs that hospitals no longer have in stock			0
number 371 , later introduced as 75 - year - old @entity258 , gets up from her orange plastic chair to reach the counter only to be told that her diabetes medicine is no available , and she should come back in a few days			2
" but i must take it today			0
this is not something that can wait , " she says			0
this is the third of the five such authorized pharmacies in @entity0 that she has traveled to that day , desperate to find her much - needed medication			0
" i used to be a social worker			0
i have paid my contributions all my life and now that i am old my pension has been slashed to almost half and my country is leaving me to rot			0
" many of those waiting in line offer similar accounts , echoing the frustration over what they see as the breach of a social contract			0
a team of officials representing @entity7 's creditors is currently in @entity0 , assessing progress and planning ahead			2
the pharmaceutical budget is on the agenda after being severely slashed last year			2
austerity has been applied as the main treatment for @entity7 's many ailments and further cuts may be ahead as forecasts show that the country 's economy is expected to contract by a further 4 to 4.5 % this year			1
but without growth @entity7 remains on life support , dependent on its creditors			1
the government is optimistic that growth is around the corner , and that recovery will be visible within the year , with investors and depositors regaining confidence as talk of an exit from the eurozone has subsided			0
the much anticipated bank recapitalization , expected to be completed in spring , will be a first , much needed , boost			0
it will take some time before the effects of cash injections become visible to ordinary @entity16 people like @entity2 , who wake every day to the fear of not being able to find life - saving drugs			1
until then they will carry on tasting the bitter medicine of austerity that opinion polls suggest most believe has been applied in such strong doses as to kill the patient .			0
