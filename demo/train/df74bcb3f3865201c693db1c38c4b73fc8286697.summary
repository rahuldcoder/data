-- violence between competing unions at @entity4 's mines is threatening to weaken @entity4 's largest economy			1
on wednesday , the world 's top platinum producer , @entity6 , suspended all of its operations in @entity10 , @entity4 due to " intimidation " of its workers			1
striking workers are also halting operations at some gold mines			1
the move follows strike - related violence at @entity19 's marikana mine in august that left 44 dead			1
what triggered the violence ? the 34 miners in the @entity19 mine in @entity24 , @entity4 , died after police opened fire on a gathering of thousands of machete - armed workers striking for higher wages			1
the shootings came after deaths earlier in the week , including those of two police officers who were hacked to death			2
the violence exploded when police shot at striking rock drillers in the " @entity40 " area of the marikana mine			1
tensions have been high in part because of the presence of competing trade unions , the @entity44 ( @entity45 ) and the @entity46 ( @entity46 )			1
read more : @entity47 launched into mine shootings the mine , about two hours northwest of @entity50 , is operated by @entity19 , which is listed on both the @entity51 and @entity52 , and is the world 's third largest platinum producer			2
the bulk of its 28,000 employees work at the mine , and around 23 % belong to the @entity45			1
the violence has prompted some people to draw parallels with the country 's days of apartheid rule , which ended in 1994			1
@entity4 's president , @entity64 , has opened an inquiry into the incident			1
what is behind the conflict ? rivalry between the @entity45 and the @entity46 is widely blamed for feeding the violence			1
the @entity45 , which has expanded rapidly this year at the expense of @entity46 , is seen as the more militant union and has been linked to aggressive tactics to win wage increases			1
it has gained ground in an environment where workers have been dissatisfied with improvements in quality of life since the end of apartheid , particularly for those in the lower wage brackets			2
at @entity24 , 3,000 rock drill operators at the mine stopped work as they tried to force an increase in their wages , from @entity91 , 400 ( $ 648 ) a month to zar12 , 500 ( $ 1,500 ) a month			0
tensions increased over the following days , with @entity45 president @entity93 declaring the members were prepared to " die here " if necessary			1
the stand - off later escalated into violence , leaving 34 dead , 78 injured and 259 arrested on various charges , according to @entity4 national police commissioner @entity99			1
the violence follows other fatal incidents including a six - week strike at @entity103 ( @entity104 ) in february , which left three dead , and an attack on @entity106 in august which also left three people dead			2
the push for higher wages comes after the @entity45 was " clearly emboldened " by a strike at @entity104 ' @entity114 mine in february which resulted in a 125 % increase in wages , analysts at @entity109 noted			1
the outcome set a " problematic precedent for platinum companies in @entity4 , " @entity4 analyst @entity117 said			0
@entity121 , analyst at @entity122 , said the emergence of the @entity45 " represents the single biggest risk to the platinum sector , particularly as many of the incidents in which the @entity45 has been implicated have involved violence			1
" according to @entity117 , however , violence at @entity24 could prove to be detrimental to the union 's aggressive recruitment strategy			1
who is to blame for the marikana shootings ? while union rivalry is being blamed for the friction , it is unclear who triggered the first shots at @entity24 , which is one of the country 's bloodiest incidents since the end of apartheid in 1994			1
police have said they were bringing in barbed wire to fence the miners , and used tear gas and stun grenades to disperse them			2
according to @entity150 , a militant group of strikers then fired on police who said they were forced to use " maximum force " to defend themselves			2
video from the incident shows police shooting for some minutes at protesters , kicking up dust			0
when the dust clears , several bodies are shown lying on the ground			0
the video appeared to show the police response was " very forceful , " @entity121 said			0
the @entity164 said that policemen randomly shot into the crowd with rifles and handguns			0
" there is also evidence of their continuing to shoot after a number of bodies can be seen dropping and others turning to run			0
this is reminiscent of the @entity178 massacre in 1960 , " the institute said			0
in a press conference @entity99 said it was not a time for placing blame , but " a time for us to mourn			0
" late last month , a regional prosecutor charged 270 of the platinum miners with the murder of their colleagues , who are believed to have been shot by police			2
however , the charges are being dropped			0
what do the unions say ? the two implicated unions , accused of trying to outdo each other in negotiating wages , denied instigating the clashes			1
@entity45 general secretary @entity195 told @entity0 the union could not be blamed			1
" we are a peaceful organization and we do not condone violence , " he said			0
@entity195 said police initially shot at the protesters from behind , although when asked if they shot first he said : " i was not there , " adding : " the killing of those people was not necessary			0
" he said @entity93 's reference to being prepared to die was in response to fears the police would attack			2
@entity207 , head of the @entity46 , said monday that its members were under siege			2
" our members have been attacked , and that can not be said to be clashes or rivalry , it is pure criminality , " he said			2
is the government tarnished ? the @entity46 is a close ally of the country 's ruling @entity222 and its inability to stop the violence and weakened role is expected to drag on @entity64 , according to @entity117			1
the immediate impact is likely to be @entity64 's pitch for re-election to head the party in december , he added			1
re-election is " significantly less likely " @entity117 said			0
while there is no formal challenger to the role yet , this could spur the emergence of one , he added			0
people are no longer willing to sit and wait around for the @entity222 to deliver , @entity117 said			2
" they are becoming more and more impatient and they 're becoming more and more violent as a result			0
" what is the impact on @entity19 ? @entity19 has so far missed out on around $ 75 million in lost production , and the workers have n't been paid for a month			0
the company said last week that a " peace accord " had been signed , but key unions had not agreed to the deal			0
@entity19 acting ceo @entity249 said the company and unions have agreed to " negotiate to address the wage demands within a legal framework			0
" he added , " we simply ask that those negotiations happen in an environment free of intimidation and violence			0
" the company has previously announced its chief executive @entity259 had been diagnosed with a serious illness and was in hospital			0
it was unrelated to the mine incident			0
@entity0 's @entity264 contributed to this story			0
