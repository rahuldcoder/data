however , taking @entity24 at her word , i am optimistic and hopeful for the first time in more years then i care to admit			1
" the 31 - page decision , released monday , questioned " the process by which the petitioner 's conviction was obtained " and suggested that because of the " vast moral panic " about child sexual abuse that was prevalent in the late 1980s and early ' 90s might have led police officials to cut corners in their investigation			2
in unusually strong language , the 2nd @entity62 decision stated that " ... the police , prosecutors and the judge did everything they could to coerce a guilty plea and avoid a trial " and said there was a " reasonable likelihood " @entity21 was " wrongfully convicted " of sexually abusing children			1

" if i went to trial , i was doomed , " he said			0
the court decision stated that although by law the court could not overturn @entity92 as it was filed too late , it suggested that the @entity12 prosecutor 's office reinvestigate the case			0
