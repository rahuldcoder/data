@entity0 , @entity1 -- after years of trying to put the past behind it , @entity1 has created a truth commission to investigate crimes committed during a painful period in history known as the dirty war			1
hundreds of people disappeared or were killed during a 20 - year military dictatorship that ended in 1985			1
violent student protests and an armed underground movement were squashed in brutal crackdowns			2
some 9,000 people were jailed and tortured			1
among them was a young leftist guerrilla , @entity17 , who went on to become the current president of @entity1			1
@entity17 inaugurated the commission in may			1
" @entity1 deserves the truth			1
the new generations deserve the truth , " she said at a ceremony in @entity23			1
" above all , those who lost friends and relatives and who continue suffering as if they were dying again every day deserve the truth , " she said as she choked back tears			1
a blanket amnesty law drawn up during the dictatorship means the commission wo n't launch any trials			1
but some @entity1 hope it could be a first step toward having that law abolished , something that has already happened in neighboring @entity39 and @entity40			1
torture victims have long fought for a change to the law			0
@entity44 was jailed in 1972 along with her husband at a @entity0 police station once known as @entity47 , a notorious torture center			2
" that 's where my cell was , it was ' @entity52 , ' " @entity44 said as she walked around the now - reformed police station			0
" from what i remember , i was tortured for 15 days			2
" teles and her husband were militants of the underground @entity56			0
she said police brought in their children , ages 4 and 5 , to pressure them			0
" when ( the children ) saw me , they said , ' @entity61 , why is @entity63 green and you 're blue ? ' " @entity44 said			0
" i looked down at my body and realized i was so bruised that i was blue all over			0
" @entity44 pointed to the second - story rooms where she said she suffered waterboarding and electric shocks and spent hours in a device called the " parrot 's perch			0
" " i spent days without any hope of surviving , " she said			0
" but the fact that i can come here and speak and not be jailed ... i think that 's progress			2
that 's a political victory			0
" the seven - member truth commission has been given two years to investigate human rights crimes			1
it has unprecedented access to former prisoners , military leaders and archives			1
@entity86 , one of the commissioners and a former diplomat at the @entity89 , said the group hopes to expose information that has been hidden for the last 27 years			0
" we are trying to reconstruct the chain of command of the decisions to kill or torture , " @entity86 said			0
" something that 's not clear or transparent at this moment			0
" the government has had to overcome outright hostility from retired military brass , and the commission is now grappling with the possibility that some of the archives may have been destroyed			1
but @entity86 is optimistic the commission will help @entity1 come to terms with its past and a legacy of impunity in some institutions			1
" there are some practices by state agents , like torture or summary executions , that need to be stopped , " he said			0
" the report , the work of the truth commission , will be a collaboration to deal with this terrible legacy			1
" many @entity1 agree that exposing the truth is a way of exacting justice			1
@entity125 was 9 years old when his father , the editor - in - chief of a tv station , was killed while in jail			0
military officials called it a suicide			2
but @entity125 said he believes his father , @entity133 , was tortured and killed , a theory that archives have supported			1
@entity125 said he does n't want revenge , but he does want the perpetrators to be known			0
" to be held accountable by society , " he said , " that 's the most important thing			0
" more and more @entity1 are calling for the same			2
a group of young activists has started organizing protests outside the homes of former military rulers to denounce them to their neighbors and society at large			2
" these people who are living the good life like nothing happened , i want to see them excluded , " @entity125 said			0
" that 's my biggest wish			0
