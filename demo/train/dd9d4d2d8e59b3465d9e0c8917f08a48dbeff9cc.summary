-- when you 're the head of one of the biggest broadcast networks in the world , the last thing you want to hear from your teenage daughter is that they do n't want a tv in their home			1
" that was n't gon na fly			2
not for one minute , " says @entity11 , co-chair of @entity12 and president of the @entity12 / @entity14 , after her daughter moved to college and snubbed the idea of taking the ubiquitous tube			1
" i said to her : ' @entity21 , television has been very very good to you			1
you will have a television if i have to nail it to your wall			1
' " and it was one of those ' @entity29 , you do n't understand			2
i watch everything online now			2
' " @entity11 might be one of the most powerful people in television -- overseeing @entity33 , @entity34 , and @entity35			1
but when it comes to predicting trends , her two children have always been ahead of the pack			2
" i 've always said , if you want to know what the future is , ask a nine - year - old because they 're just so adept , " said the 56 - year - old , who @entity41 named the 18th most powerful woman in business			1
" what they taught me was to be less parochial , less conventional , to be more daring			2
they were so free to experiment with technology			2
i remember my son putting a piece of liquorice into the vcr and not understanding why he could n't see it on the television set			1
" the future of television " create what 's next , " has become @entity61 's motto , and under her leadership she 's steered the company through a brave new world where watching television is no longer about families gathering around a hulking black box in the corner of the room			1
indeed , in 2005 she got a call from @entity73 's @entity72 -- " i thought , ' that 's cool , i 've always wanted to talk to @entity72 ' " -- about a new piece of technology , the video @entity77			2
" as i held the video @entity77 in my hand i thought , ' i really like this			2
' i was watching an episode of @entity82 -- the sound was pristine , the quality of the picture was excellent			0
" no one knew that that would be the beginning of probably the biggest moment in our television group -- this move towards technology that would make our content available wherever you are , on whatever device you 're holding at that moment			1
" under @entity61 , @entity12 / @entity14 became the first media company to put television content on new platforms -- eventually selling videos on @entity101			1
it 's something we now take for granted as we watch our favorite programs in the palm of our hands			0
in 2006 , it also became the first network to stream full episodes online , winning an @entity109 for technical innovation			0
day in the life not bad for someone critics initially said did n't have enough experience for the top job at @entity12 / @entity14			1
funnily enough , @entity61 agrees			0
" i knew they were right , " she said , joining the company in 1996 after working 12 years at @entity118 's @entity117 in various executive positions , and later as chairman and ceo of @entity122 for three years			1
" i did n't have the experience			0
but i really did n't care what people said because i was so excited to lead @entity14 , " she says , adding : " my strategy was to go in and learn			1
" today , @entity61 heads almost 10,000 employees , overseeing 107 channels in 166 countries			0
this is a woman who rises at 4.30 am every morning , receiving anywhere between 300 and 500 emails each day -- " i read through them quickly , and i delegate well , ' she says			0
@entity29 's the word growing up in @entity138 , @entity61 's mother was a teacher , her father a school principal , and she describes her mom as both her first mentor and a " powerhouse			0
" her dream job as a child was to be a ballerina and later an actress			0
@entity61 received a masters in education from @entity150 , before landing a job at @entity118 in the early 1980s , and in 1993 moved to @entity122 " going to @entity152 and working for @entity153 was like being handed a saddle and given a horse and just told to ride , go fast , " she says			0
" there was tremendous creative freedom			0
" family first her " favorite job , " however is being a mom to @entity21 and son @entity160 -- who is autistic			0
it 's a job she says she could n't do without the help of her husband and " absolutely magnificent " father of her children , @entity166 , who lives with her in @entity168 , @entity169			0
when it comes to caring for @entity160 , she says : " do n't be the martyr , do n't be the hero parent , talk openly about it			0
because i found that the more i talked about it , the more people came up to me and would whisper : ' my child is autistic			1
' and i realized that some people felt that there was a stigma and i thought : ' oh , i do n't feel a stigma			1
' " so does @entity11 " have it all ? " " is it hard to work and have kids ? absolutely , " she says			1
" and look at how many tens of millions of mothers do this in this country every single day			0
you know to me , ' having it all ' is having your love			0
