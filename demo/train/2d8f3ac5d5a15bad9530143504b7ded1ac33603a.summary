come the end of sunday , one lucky golfer will go home at least $ 10 million richer			1
that same man may also pocket another cool $ 1.44 million , depending on whether he manages to win the @entity5 's season - ending @entity4			1
some $ 8 million will be on offer to the elite 30 - man field at @entity10 's @entity9 course , and a handful of those players will be hoping to grab the bumper jackpot bonus for being top of the @entity16 playoffs standings			1
@entity17 did so last year , taking home $ 12.5 million from the final four tournaments after winning the decider			1
the @entity21 circuit can potentially make instant millionaires at 34 of its sanctioned events -- 35 if you count the $ 990,000 on offer to the winner of the @entity26			1
but it was not always so and prize purses have come a long way in the past two decades -- especially since the advent of a certain @entity32			2
. " the tour when i started in 1956 was for about $ 650,000 total purse for 40 tournaments , " recalls @entity33 , one of professional golf 's pioneers -- a man who was something of an unsung hero compared to the well - marketed " big three " of @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			1
" it started growing in ' 58 and we grew along with it , " @entity33 told @entity46			1
" it took @entity40 about 12 years to become a millionaire			1
i was the second millionaire and it took me 14 years			1
" now 82 , @entity52 can look back on a 45 - year playing career in which he won three major titles and 51 @entity5 events -- putting him seventh on the @entity21 circuit 's all - time list			1
but it says something about the development of the game that the most money he ever won came in his final victory on the seniors ' @entity66 -- a $ 60,000 first prize			1
" i played about 45 years and i won $ 7 million			1
if i 'd played 45 years from , say , 1960 on i 'd have made a couple of hundred million			1
" in order to start out as a professional , @entity52 had to go into considerable debt , borrowing $ 15,000			2
" i had no money to start with , my wife had no money			2
i had a three - year contract and at the end of three years i paid back the people who 'd advanced me the money and gave them a large percentage ( reportedly 30 % ) of what i won , " he says			1
" i had a small sum in the bank , a little house and i owned a ' 57 @entity85 and i was on my way			0
" known as " @entity87 " due to a strict diet of organic meat and vegetables that slimmed him down to a more athletic figure , @entity52 set about his golf career with the discipline he had learned in a four - year stint in the @entity21 navy			1
" it was really a different time of training and building one 's life			2
there was n't a lot of money available			0
you had to stay with it , " he says			0
" i approached golf tournaments the same way -- i was never worried about majors , i just wanted to play the best i could each week			1
i was n't like @entity41 -- he geared himself to winning majors and he played for the majors			2
i wanted to play every week			0
i always played for my family			0
" a devoted family man and devout @entity116 , @entity52 says he still has a " close relationship " with the military			0
in the 1960s he visited @entity21 troops ( " hitting golf balls off aircraft carriers " ) at bases in @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126			2
even now , he is giving back to the armed forces through his charity work -- in the past three years @entity52 's golf facility operations company has helped raise more than $ 1.1 million for the @entity131 veterans project via the " @entity133 " event			1
last month 's staging , held at 110 of the 150 courses run by @entity136 -- the largest domestic operator in the @entity21 -- brought in $ 725,000			1
@entity52 says the abolition of conscription in the early 1970s has led to some of the @entity21 ' present social problems			0
" there was a time when it was mandatory , they had a draft			0
young people spent a certain amount of time in the military and it gave them a wonderful base to launch their lives by , " he says			0
" they got their feet on the ground , they understood what life was all about and they could make a decision as to what they wanted to do -- stay in the military or get out and follow something else			2
" when that was abolished , that 's when we started having problems with our young people			2
i think it was a wonderful program and it helped young people to build their talents , skills and abilities to go into society and be productive and carry on for their lives and education			0
i think we missed a lot when that was stopped			0
" while golfers these days earn massive amounts of money , they also give a lot back -- this year the @entity5 's total charitable donations have reached almost $ 2 billion , dating back to 1938			1
everyone from world no. 1 woods to your average tour pro seems to have a cause celebre , and @entity52 believes they are a breed apart from their fellow athletes in other sports			0
" most of them do a lot of charity work			0
i had my own tournament for 22 years and we 've given over $ 3 million to kids , " he says			1
" everybody seems to have something they 're involved in -- they 're raising funds and they 're grateful for the life they 're leading and they 're willing to share what they earn			2
" other sports are nowhere near as close to this			0
i think it 's a top class of people who play the game			2
they have the chance to be involved with all the big companies and are very interested in helping people			0
" despite the recent years of economic hardship , @entity52 says his company has actually grown -- taking over struggling public courses in 24 states and turning them around			1
" everybody is having problems right now and they 're looking for ways to keep afloat , " he says			0
" there are a lot of courses that have gone to grass , they 've shut down			0
" @entity52 says the secret to his business success is down to traditional values			0
" we run our courses as if we are dealing with family -- all of our clients and clientele we deal with like they 're family			2
when you deal with people that are family you deal differently than if you 're in business , " he says			0
" we develop this wonderful relationship that if you come to one of our courses then you feel wanted and you want to come back			0
" @entity33 , who has achieved so much for so long , hopes that he can continue " to be of service to my fellow beings through the game of golf			1
" " recently i gave a lecture and a gentleman came to me and asked how i 'd like to be remembered			0
i 'd never been asked that before , so i thought for a few seconds , and i said i want to be remembered that i had a great love for my fellow man			0
