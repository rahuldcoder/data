@entity0 , @entity1 -- on friday in @entity0 's @entity5 , 5,000 members of the public were served a free hot curry , free apple juice and an array of fresh groceries			1
the lunchtime feast , dished up by volunteers -- including the @entity12 and the mayor of @entity0 , @entity14 and -- was made entirely from ingredients that otherwise would have been wasted , such as fresh but cosmetically imperfect " wonky " fruit and vegetables that fail to meet the supermarkets ' strict cosmetic standards			1
the event demonstrated how easy it is to reduce the unimaginable levels of food waste both in the @entity24 and internationally , and how governments , businesses and individuals can all help to change the way waste has become rife in our globalized food chain			1
putting on an event of this scale has involved hundreds of volunteers and numerous partner organizations and charities			0
before the event , over 300 volunteers have given their time to wash , peel , chop , cook and serve the delicious curry			0
the ingredients themselves have been sourced from farmers who donated several tons of vegetables and fruit			0
during the event , @entity47 , a charity which serves up community meals made from surplus food , put on cookery demonstrations in the @entity52 led by popular @entity24 chefs			1
tons more food donated by farmers was passed on to @entity56 , a food redistribution charity that feeds vulnerable people who may not otherwise eat a square meal			1
in addition , around a ton of surplus apples was delivered to @entity5 so that passersby can press them to make fresh juice			0
@entity65 brought along four pigs to eat the leftover apple pulp			0
feeding 5,000 people is a challenge , but according to my calculations , if we could hypothetically save all the food wasted across the @entity24 on any one day , there would be enough to feed 60 million people ( i.e. , the entire nation ) and still leave some over for tea - time			1
the aim of these activities is to demonstrate that everybody can gain by tackling food waste			2
the food we buy and eat is part of an international food supply chain			0
in straitened times it becomes ever more important to address the chronic problem of wastage in food production on farms , in factories , in supermarkets , restaurants , and in homes all across the world			1
saving food really does help alleviate hunger , in rich countries as in poor ones			0
tackling food waste is also good for the environment			2
in my book , waste : the @entity102 ( 2009 ) , i calculated that 10 % of all greenhouse gas emissions come from producing food that no - one eats			2
waste has become so endemic to food production , that we now take for granted attitudes and practices that our ancestors would be appalled by			2
for example , until 10 years ago , pigs in @entity112 were often raised on a diet of food scraps			0
today , however , @entity112 livestock is raised on a diet of soya imported from @entity119			0
soya is expensive for farmers , and its cultivation contributes to the destruction of the @entity125 rainforest			0
because pigs fed on specially - grown soya no longer eat waste food , this creates the further problem of how to dispose of food waste			2
@entity133 currently sent to landfill , for example , decomposes into methane , a greenhouse gas 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide			1
the answer , as the event on friday aimed to demonstrate , is to bring common - sense back into the food chain : eat what you can , redistribute what you ca n't , feed food not fit for humans to pigs , and only then turn to other waste solutions , such as composting or anaerobic digestion			1
we , the public , have the responsibility , and the power , to demand change			0
80 % of consumers in the @entity24 want businesses to cut food waste , and @entity159 is urging everyone around the world to sign the pledge calling on food businesses , governments and citizens to stop wasting so much food			1
food businesses , restaurants and retailers are being urged to sign up to the @entity170 and commit to tackling waste			1
we all have a role in ending the global food waste scandal			2
the opinions in this piece are solely those of @entity176 .			0

@entity0 event aims to feed 5000 people using food normally considered to be waste
edible food is often thrown away by businesses , restaurants and retailers
@entity133 sent to landfill decomposes into methane , which is 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide
