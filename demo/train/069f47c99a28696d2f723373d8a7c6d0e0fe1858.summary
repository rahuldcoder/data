-- behind every great woman -- is another great woman			1
@entity4 ' success at last year 's @entity5 catapulted her to fame , fortune and glory			1
the first black woman of any nationality to win gold in the individual all - around gymnastics event , the teenager was hailed as the face of progress , an all - american star and the nation 's newest celebrity			1
but that is just the tip of a story which takes in divorce , financial peril , racism and a mother 's fight to give her daughter the opportunity she so badly craved			1
fighter @entity30 may not be as limber and supple as her teenage daughter , but nobody can doubt her strength			1
" my mom has influenced me so much , " @entity34 told @entity0 's " @entity36 " documentary			1
" she 's taught me how to be a fighter and i love her so much			1
i do n't know if this journey could be possible without her by my side supporting me			1
" @entity34 ' battle to become an @entity44 champion began at the age of six when she began to copy the moves of her older sister , @entity47			1
inspired by watching @entity48 , the first @entity49 gymnast to ever qualify and compete in an @entity44 , @entity34 set her heart on emulating her heroine			1
along with her mother , @entity48 provided another strong role model during a difficult childhood where @entity34 ' parents divorced and money was scarce			1
" i loved @entity48 , " @entity34 said of the 1996 @entity58 gold medalist			1
" we did a couple of events together and she 's just a such a joy to be around			1
she inspired me to do bigger and better things			1
" i find that funny now because i remember when i was younger and i looked up to my role models			1
but now the tables have turned and i 'm the role model			1
" i love girls , parents , whoever it may be , coming up to me and saying , ' you inspire my daughter			1
' " struggle the 17 - year - old is aware that life will never be the same following her performances in @entity77 -- having overcome difficult circumstances , she is now a bankable star			1
one of four children at home , her gymnastics was at the heart of the family , with her mom supporting her financially at every opportunity			2
even when @entity30 suffered a negative reaction to prescription medication and was forced to leave her job at a bank in 2009 , she managed to find a way to support her daughter			2
while @entity34 ' father @entity92 remained a stranger for much of her childhood , @entity30 was there when it mattered , especially once her daughter became a global superstar			2
but protecting @entity4 -- nicknamed " the @entity4 " due to her acrobatics -- from wider attention was quite a different proposition			1
in a world where social media presents an instant opportunity for people to make a judgment , @entity34 found out the hard way when @entity107 went berserk with criticism of her hair style			2
it was an episode which infuriated @entity30 , who was left bewildered by the abuse at her daughter			2
what it did do , however , was add further backing to @entity34 ' assertion that female gymnasts are at a far higher risk of criticism than their male counterparts every time they wander into the arena			2
strength " @entity125 women have to do a lot more than the men , " said @entity34 reflecting on the criticism			2
" we 've got our hair and makeup to do			2
the men can just go out there but we have to get ready			2
" when we 're looking spot - on nobody even notices			1
they just say , ' oh , she looks good , ' but when you look horrible then everyone is like , ' whoosh			2
' " you just handle it and be yourself			2
you do n't want to let people tear you down			2
you just kind of make a joke out of it , laugh at it			2
" there 's always the next time , always another awards show red carpet that we can look fabulous at			2
you 've just got to learn from it and be yourself ; do n't focus on the negative comments			2
i want to just focus on the positive			2
" the gold medals soon silenced those trolling @entity34 online , with her achievements transforming her from a potential star to a global superstar			1
but her journey to the very top was a long and often arduous route , taking @entity34 away from the comforts of home and family			2
from the age of eight , she trained at @entity165 in @entity166 -- a club which had provided the @entity125 national team with 10 members since 1995			0
so intense was her schedule that she was forced to undergo home schooling while her mother worked nights to provide extra funds for the tuition			1
it was there that she began to blossom , winning national titles and competing on the international stage as she began to show glimpses of what was to come			0
but @entity34 ' relationship with her coaches began to deteriorate following a wrist injury in 2009			0
mocked it was a tough time for the teenager , who in the past has spoken about how she was mercilessly mocked both for her appearance and her race by fellow teammates			0
the combination proved too much for both @entity34 and @entity30 , who decided that the future lay away from @entity166 and in @entity192 , @entity193			0
for the first time , @entity34 would be away from the woman who had inspired her and fought for her opportunity to pursue her dream			0
it was a difficult time for the youngster , who moved in with a host family in @entity193 -- the @entity203			0
" at first i was really excited , " @entity34 recalled			0
" i was ready to take on the journey but my mom and sister came with me for a week and when they left i was just miserable			0
" i was so sad leaving my family			0
i had a time where i said that i needed to suck it up and put on my big girl pants			0
" this was my decision			0
i knew i had to go to the gym and work very hard , because i think in the gym i was kind of giving up a little too			0
i decided to push myself			0
" dreams and push she did -- both mentally and physically , @entity34 began to reach the heights of which she had only dreamed years earlier			0
working under the gaze of @entity221 coach @entity220 , the man who helped @entity222 win gold at @entity224 in 2008 , @entity34 spent four to five hours in the gym every day			1
it was a grueling workload , with @entity34 adapting to the @entity221 method of coaching rather than the technique she picked up in her formative years in @entity166			0
" it is a bit different , but i love @entity220 's style , " she said			0
" he corrected my technique and the quality of my gymnastics , and him and his wife @entity238 have shaped me up into this amazing gymnast in a year and a half			1
" champion the hard work has certainly paid off			0
gold on the uneven bars at the 2010 @entity245 catapulted @entity34 into the limelight before she took silver in the beam at the @entity125 junior nationals			1
she was part of the @entity125 team which won gold at the @entity253 before a stellar 2012 placed her at the forefront of the national consciousness			1
four gold medals , one silver and one bronze all arrived within 12 months before @entity34 produced a magnificent exhibition at the @entity125 @entity261 to win the all - around competition			1
alongside @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 and @entity266 , @entity34 helped the @entity125 women 's team win gold in @entity77 -- the first time the nation had triumphed in female gymnastics since that team including @entity48 in 1996			1
the team , dubbed the " @entity273 , " brought a zest and flair to the @entity44 which captured the imagination of gymnastics fans not just in @entity77 but across the world			1
" we had this girl power , " @entity34 recalls			0
" we just said , ' let 's be sassy , ' and we bonded really well , meshed together and it was amazing			0
" i think people should definitely be paying attention to women 's sport because we can do a lot of things			0
" we 're very powerful , strong minded and whenever we want something , we go out there and fight			0
i definitely think people should pay more attention			0
" celebrity @entity34 has had no shortage of attention following those triumphs			1
now she is one of the most instantly recognizable figures in @entity125 sport , hosting awards nights , speaking at events for kids and modeling on the catwalk			0
sponsors have quickly realized the value of @entity34 ' success -- @entity307 , @entity308 and @entity309 are among the firms to have signed deals with her			0
" it 's very fun , " said @entity34 about her new - found lifestyle in front of the camera			1
" i love doing photo shoots and commercials , it 's really fun			0
they like to keep it exciting with a lot of energy			0
i have a blast doing all this stuff			0
" but with the whole fame thing , i just try to take it one step at a time			0
it can be difficult to handle everything at once with celebrity , the gym and school			1
" so when i 'm at school i think about school , when i 'm at the gym i think about the gym and when i 'm outside and traveling i think about that			0
i do n't like to cram myself with everything			0
" role model young she might be , but @entity34 is wise beyond her years			0
aware of her influence on her peers and younger following , she is as keen as ever to inspire those who seek to replicate her success			1
whether it be by hosting kids ' awards , motivational speaking or just taking time to sign autographs , this is one woman who is desperate to make a difference			0
" i have this platform and i love using it , " she added			0
" some girls or moms come up to me and say , ' you inspire my daughter , ' or ' @entity4 , you 've inspired me to do great things			1
' " i just want to help them believe in themselves and i want them to know that anything is possible if you set your mind to it			0
