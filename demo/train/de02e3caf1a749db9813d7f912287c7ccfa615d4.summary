-- when two important countries appear to be goading each other into a dangerous and meaningless war , it can be useful to take a deep breath , lay the rhetoric aside for a moment , and go back to basics			1
the past several weeks have seen a sharp increase in the three - decade war of words between the @entity11 and @entity12			1
@entity12 has held maneuvers in the critical @entity14 , combined with threats to interrupt commerce there			2
the @entity11 has lost its third drone over @entity12 , and unnamed parties are conducting an unprecedented covert campaign of cyberwar and assassinations inside @entity12			1
@entity12 says it has broken up a @entity11 spy ring and has condemned a @entity11 citizen to death			1
president @entity25 launched @entity11 sanctions against @entity12 's oil industry by executive order in the election year of 1995 ; at that time , @entity12 had not a single centrifuge turning			1
after a decade and a half of the @entity11 and the international community 's escalating sanctions , @entity12 has more than 8,000 centrifuges spinning and a substantial stock of low - enriched uranium			1
this is the very definition of a failed policy			0
the @entity39 in december passed a defense authorization bill that included provisions intended to bring down the @entity42			0
although president @entity44 expressed reservations , he signed it into law			0
this latest @entity11 sanctions package is openly intended to deprive @entity12 of its oil revenues			1
by prohibiting other countries from dealing with @entity12 's banks , it is intended to prevent @entity12 from selling its oil			2
that is the equivalent of an act of war -- a financial blockade of @entity12 's oil ports that would deprive @entity12 of more than half its budgetary revenues			1
we should not be surprised that a country faced with economic warfare would remind the world that it , too , can create mischief			0
@entity12 can not close the @entity14 for a prolonged period of time , but it is capable of impeding oil traffic out of the @entity68 for many months			2
the loss of its own oil exports would be the trigger for such action , which would drive up the price of oil to unforeseeable levels and risk a wider regional war			0
a war with @entity12 would not be surgical , brief , or one - sided			1
as memorably noted by gen. @entity79 , if you like @entity80 and @entity81 , you will love @entity12			2
it is a huge country , well - defended , with a fierce sense of nationalism			0
no air campaign , even if prolonged , will end the problem			0
regardless of how a conflict begins , it is most likely to end with lots of boots on the ground			0
a squad of special forces will not do the job			0
paradoxically , the quickest way to insure that the @entity12 decide to go for a bomb may be to bomb them			2
the most predictable result of a military strike would be @entity12 's withdrawal from the @entity100 and the ejection of @entity103 inspectors and cameras that watch every step of the @entity12 enrichment process			1
@entity12 has a dreadful leadership			2
the surest way to rally the @entity12 people around this corrupt and repressive system is for an external power to attack it			2
in the past few days , we have been reminded by secretary of defense @entity113 that @entity12 has made no decision to actually build a nuclear weapon			1
at the same time , secretary of state @entity119 , while denouncing @entity12 's decision to proceed with its deep underground enrichment facility near @entity118 , has forcefully reiterated the @entity11 call for @entity12 to return to the nuclear negotiating table			1
in the midst of all the saber - rattling and the clamor of an election year , what is there to talk about ? a good place to begin would be the original @entity11 offer to swap 20 % - enriched fuel plates , to be used in @entity12 's research reactor , for @entity12 enriched uranium			1
the fuel plates were originally a gift from the @entity11 to be used in the production of medical isotopes			2
@entity12 tentatively agreed to such an offer in 2009 , only to withdraw it in the face of domestic opposition			0
it later accepted the proposal in writing , guaranteed by @entity143 and @entity144 , only to have it rejected by the @entity11 in 2010			0
@entity12 has since signaled its willingness to resume discussions without preconditions			0
@entity11 policy has been one of pressure leading to negotiations			0
@entity12 has also pursued a dual - track policy of threats combined with offers of negotiation			1
these policies have resulted in the prospect of a war that would be disastrous to all			0
what we need right now is a crisis exit ramp			1
perhaps this is the moment to explore the negotiating track that both sides say they prefer			1

the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			0

@entity172 : @entity12 and @entity11 are goading each other and need to step back
sick : sanctions to stop nuclear *program* in @entity12 , set in 1995 , have failed
he says war with @entity12 would not be won with *aerial* campaign and would be *catastrophic*
we need an exit ramp , he says , and must explore the negotiating track both sides say they prefer
