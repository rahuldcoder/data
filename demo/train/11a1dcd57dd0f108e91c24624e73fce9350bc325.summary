@entity0 -- in one ill - fated fundraiser , @entity2 managed to offend @entity4 , latinos and some of the same people he 's counting on for support if he wants to unseat president @entity9			1
it is n't the first time @entity2 's oratory fumbles have put his campaign on its heels , handed opponents material to push the stereotype of him as an out - of - touch businessman and provoked members of the party 's conservative base to question his worthiness as their standard - bearer			1
" everybody has the same reaction : ' dumb , dumb , dumb , ' " said @entity26 , director of the @entity28 's @entity27 , adding that @entity2 's gaffes reinforce a sitcom - like caricature of the candidate			1
opinion : what 's wrong with @entity2 after the tape , recorded during a may 17 private fundraiser at the home of @entity39 executive @entity38 , made the rounds on monday , @entity2 convened a hastily scheduled news conference monday night in which he said his comments were " off the cuff " and " not elegantly stated			1
" however , he defended the main message of his remarks , saying he that while he could have made them " more clearly , " he said he was trying to point out the differences between his and @entity9 's campaigns			1
@entity51 pundits gloated and were content to let @entity2 's words speak for themselves			1
" i mean , i do n't think @entity51 had much to say at all			0
i mean , there was n't much left to say , " @entity51 strategist @entity53 said on @entity1 's " @entity54			2
" " look , i mean , i think that , you know , big picture , this is a -- was a devastating moment for governor @entity2 , potentially fatal , as people start to focus on this campaign			2
" narratives at work another @entity51 strategist said that @entity2 's comments played into the two narratives that they have pushed : " first , that he does n't care about the middle class			1
well , thanks for the help , @entity77 , " @entity70 , a @entity1 contributor and a senior adviser in the leading pro-obama super @entity73 , said on @entity1 's " @entity74			0
" " on the second front ... in order to give big tax cuts for the rich , @entity2 is going to have to raise taxes on the middle class			2
well , when you 're claiming to wealthy people that 47 percent of @entity87 do n't pay federal income tax , i think a lot of those people , retirees , working class folks are going to listen to that and think , ' @entity84 , i guess the @entity51 are right			0
i guess he does want to raise the taxes on the middle class in order to help the rich			0
' " @entity98 strategist @entity97 , who served in the @entity99 , said the comments would wound @entity2 but it would n't be a fatal one			1
video threatens @entity2 campaign " you can understand while he tripped over his words , it probably was n't characterized the best way			2
i think we can all agree with that , " she said on " @entity54			0
" " you can understand what he was trying to say			0
do we have a systemic problem in this country when you have almost 50 percent of people not paying any federal income taxes ? and he 's running on a platform that would fundamentally change the tax code so that you lower the base , broaden the base and lower tax rates across the board			0
" reaction from other conservatives was mixed			0
while some some applauded @entity2 's comments , others saw them as reinforcing why they questioned his legitimacy			1
@entity1 contributor and conservative blogger @entity131 tweeted : " dammit ! i 'm just now seeing these @entity2 secret videos			2
we need that guy on the campaign trail ! " others , such as @entity139 columnist , @entity138 , wrote " @entity2 's comment is a country - club fantasy			1
it 's what self - satisfied millionaires say to each other			0
it reinforces every negative view people have about @entity2			2
" and conservative commentator @entity148 , a frequent critic of @entity2 , called the remarks " stupid and arrogant			2
" " it 's worth recalling that a good chunk of the 47 percent who do n't pay income taxes are @entity2 supporters â € ” especially of course seniors ( who might well " believe they are entitled to heath care , " a position @entity2 agrees with ) , as well as many lower - income @entity87 ( including men and women serving in the military ) who think conservative policies are better for the country even if they 're not getting a tax cut under the @entity2 plan			2
so @entity2 seems to have contempt not just for the @entity51 who oppose him , but for tens of millions who intend to vote for him , " @entity148 posted on the @entity168 on tuesday			2
@entity2 campaign responds a @entity2 adviser tried to put the comments in context : " what he 's saying is there are people out there who do n't pay taxes , unfortunately , " @entity174 , a senior adviser , said on @entity1 's " @entity175 " on tuesday			1
" they 're in a position where they 're dependent on government , and those individuals are -- those @entity87 are voting for @entity9			2
they 're in his backyard			0
and so those are people that i 'm not going to be able to reach with my 20 percent tax cut or my cuts in spending because they would be concerned			0
it 's not going to impact them getting a 20 percent tax cut			0
they do n't pay taxes			0
" @entity2 's comments were recorded by a hidden camera and posted monday afternoon on the left - leaning news websites @entity201 and the @entity202			1
@entity2 argued nearly half of @entity87 will vote for @entity9 because they rely on government support			1
adding to his argument about entitlement , @entity2 said his " job is not to worry about those people			2
" he also joked about wishing he had @entity210 heritage and talks about a @entity213 factory his former firm purchased			0
a clip released tuesday morning showed @entity2 questioning the prospect of ever reaching peace between @entity218 and @entity4 , calling a path to a solution in the region " almost unthinkable to accomplish			2
" " i 'm torn by two perspectives in this regard , " @entity2 is shown saying in a clip that only shows only the candidate speaking and does not include any questions that may have prompted his remarks			1
" one is the one which i 've had for some time , which is that the @entity4 have no interest whatsoever in establishing peace , and that the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish			0
" opinion : how @entity2 really feels about the @entity98 with two weeks until the first presidential debate and less than two months before the election , the timing could n't be worse , political experts say			1
the @entity2 campaign had banked on its convention last month to make a favorable introduction of @entity2 to the electorate , a large part of it just beginning to pay attention to the election			1
but a @entity1 / @entity246 poll conducted after the convention showed @entity2 gained only a 1 % rise in the polls while @entity9 gained three to four times that much following the @entity51 ' convention			1
@entity2 's acceptance speech was largely overshadowed by a rambling , off - the - cuff monologue by actor @entity253 , which preceded it			1
last week , @entity2 was criticized by @entity51 and @entity98 alike for an aggressive and politically charged response to violent attacks on @entity87 embassies in @entity259 and @entity260			1
after the attacks , @entity2 in a statement said , " it 's disgraceful that the @entity9 administration 's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions , but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks			1
" series of gaffes over the weekend , @entity273 posted a story that detailed tensions within @entity2 's campaign and on monday the campaign launched a new effort to inject energy and fresh policy details with a series of speeches and advertising			1
" there 's been a bit of bad luck involved in some of it , " said @entity284 , chairman of @entity286 's political science department			0
" it 's not a surprise that these blunt remarks are going to be made in front of this type of audience			0
here 's a guy who 's trying to work on his image about caring and this does n't help him at all			0
" @entity2 has been plagued by a series of gaffes during his presidential run			1
he joked with unemployed workers in @entity304 in june 2011 that he , too , was also unemployed			0
in january of this year , he told a crowd of supporters that he likes " being able to fire people " in a talk about insurance companies			0
he went on to say that if someone did n't provide adequate services , he liked to be able to find someone else who would			0
but critics took the first part of the quote used it to paint him as a venture capitalist focused only on a company 's bottom line			0
controversial video shows candid @entity2 in a february interview , @entity2 told @entity1 that he is " not concerned about the very poor , " citing the safety net in place by the @entity87 government and said that his primary focus is the middle class			0
but it was the first part of the sentence that critics pounced on as evidence of @entity2 's elitism , while conservatives said the safety net he talked about only encouraged a welfare state			1
later that month , at a campaign stop at the @entity336 @entity335 race , @entity2 told a reporter that while he might not follow the sport as closely as the most ardent fans , " i have some great friends who are @entity335 team owners			2
" and at an event in @entity342 , he tried to prove he was behind the @entity87 automotive industry by saying that he drove a @entity344 and a @entity346 pickup and that his wife , @entity349 , " drives a couple of @entity348			0
" defenders sought to defuse the controversy by pointing to @entity9 's comments during the 2008 @entity51 primaries about " bitter " people who " cling to guns or religion			1
" but those comments came long before the general election and did little to harm him with voters			0
@entity2 's comments will serve as a distraction in coming days but there 's still opportunities for him to get back on track with a weak economy and high jobless rate			1
" he 's a tough campaigner @entity2			2
... i do n't think one should rule him out , " @entity284 said			0
" the fundamentals are still a problem for @entity9			0
" @entity369 : weigh in about @entity2 i 'm the 47 % but - you 're wrong @entity2 ! 4,000 millionaires in @entity2 's ' 47 % ' @entity373 , @entity374 , @entity375 , @entity376 , @entity377 and @entity378 contributed to this report .			1

@entity98 presidential candidate @entity2 's verbal gaffes have once again *stymied* his campaign 's *ability* to control the narrative
*democrats* were *gleeful* , while @entity98 left scrambling after @entity2 's comments
less than two months before the election , @entity2 's *challenge* is to steer clear of speaking slip ups ; *hammer* @entity9 on the economy
