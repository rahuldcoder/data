the @entity0 plans to launch two stationary " blimps " at 10,000 - feet in the air next week to better protect the @entity2 from cruise missiles and other possible air attacks			1
it 's part of a three - year test by the @entity8 of the so - called @entity9 , which is designed to work with already - existing air defense technology			1
the tethered large balloons , called aerostats , carry technology that will almost double the reach of current ground radar detection , officials said			0
the @entity9 manufacturer , @entity18 , says the system can provide radar coverage to an area the size of @entity23			2
it will " increase decision time available to respond efficiently and accurately for the defense of the @entity2 , " @entity8 said			2
the @entity9 system -- which stands for @entity27 -- has no firing capability			2
any response to missile attacks would still come from ground missiles , ships and airplanes , according to @entity8			0
the balloons will fly above the @entity0 's @entity35 in @entity36 and do not carry any cameras			1
" it 's not for surveillance , " said @entity8 spokesman @entity38			1
" it 's simply for the detection of cruise missiles			2
" the 242 - foot - long aerostats will be tethered to the ground by 1â…› - thick " super-strong " cables , according to @entity18			0
the tethering system is designed to withstand 100 mph winds and had no problems in 106 mph winds during testing , the company said			0
the helium - filled aerostats can stay aloft for up to 30 days at a time , making it five to seven times cheaper to operate than using aircraft for the task , @entity18 says			0
@entity8 says the @entity9 system will be crewed by 130 personnel at the @entity36 base			1
the agency is working with the @entity62 so the balloons wo n't impede air traffic , @entity38 said			0
weather permitting , a launch is planned for monday , just in time to aid @entity8 in its most important december task			0
" we fully intend to take the information gathered by the system and use it to track @entity70 , " @entity38 said .			1

@entity0 will test balloons around @entity2 that *guard* against cruise missiles
it 's a three - year test of the @entity9 system and doubles radar capabilities , @entity0 says
" it 's not for surveillance , " just for cruise missiles , @entity8 spokesman *explains*
@entity8 also will use the system to track @entity70 on @entity85
