a full moon hung just right in the night sky as the fierce @entity2 faced the encroaching @entity4 troops in the spring of 1863			2
though they were outmanned and outgunned , the momentum of the war seemed to be on the side of generals @entity9 and " @entity12 " @entity10 in @entity11			1
but the tide turned in the @entity14 not long after @entity10 's own men inadvertently shot him that may night at the battle of @entity17 in @entity11			1
and for that , say two researchers , @entity19 can thank that full moon			2
it 's an intriguing concept put forth by astronomer @entity23 and researcher @entity24 from @entity25 in a study appearing in this month 's issue of @entity28			2
they say that when the men of the 18th @entity32 fired upon @entity10 , the whitish lunar light likely obscured the target			1
they did n't know it was him			0
in other words , they say , a moon phase is partly responsible for the molding of a nation " dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal , " as president @entity44 put it in the @entity46			2
the two reconstructed the scene of the shooting using moon phases and maps , and published the results 150 years after the incident			0
moonlight or no ? history seems divided on whether or not the moon shone bright that night , the researchers say , but they back up their hypothesis with recorded anecdotal accounts			1
" @entity61 was shining very brightly , rendering all objects in our immediate vicinity distinct ... , " one confederate captain wrote years later			0
" @entity61 poured a flood of light upon the wide , open turnpike			0
" @entity10 rode out with a party of officers on a scouting mission to see if the @entity70 could find a way to cut off @entity4 troops , according to the @entity73 , which cares for the nation 's @entity14 battlegrounds			1
they were shot as they returned			0
@entity78 and @entity24 say that a @entity70 officer spotted them in the moonlight and ordered his men to open fire			1
@entity10 was wounded in his left arm , which had to be amputated , according to the @entity85 , where @entity10 taught			1
he died from complications on may 10 , 1863			0
his arm was buried separate from the rest of his body			0
the @entity90 went on to win the @entity17 , but without @entity10 , took a decisive blow in july 1863 at the bloody @entity92 , often thought of as the turning point of the war			1
back lighting if @entity10 's reconnaissance party was riding in bright moonlight , then his own men should have recognized them as they returned from the @entity4 's side , but @entity78 and @entity24 say they did not -- for good reason			1
" the 18th @entity101 was looking to the southeast , directly toward the rising moon , " they said			0
it stood at " 25 degrees above the horizon " at the time , just at the wrong angle			0
" the bright moon would 've silhouetted @entity10 and his officers , completely obscuring their identities			1
" the @entity70 infantrymen likely thought their own men returning were @entity4 cavalrymen on the approach			1
" our astronomical analysis partially absolves the 18th @entity101 from blame for the wounding of @entity10 , " @entity78 says			1
it comes too late for the man who gave the order to fire			0
maj. @entity119 died at age 27 -- just two years after the end of the war			0
" his family believed his death was a result of the depression and guilt he suffered as a consequence of having given the order to fire , " the @entity85 site says			0
@entity12 may have appreciated the @entity25 researchers ' hypothesis , not only because it would have alleviated the conscience of the men who took his life			2
before joining the @entity70 , he was a science professor .			2

general @entity10 was shot at the battle of @entity17
the angle of the moonlight proved *fateful* on may 2 , 1863 , an astronomer says
it obscured the view of his own men , researchers say
@entity70 infantrymen *mistook* him for the enemy and opened fire
