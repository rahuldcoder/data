@entity0 -- a new @entity3 order aimed at preventing infiltration in the @entity5 is sparking angry condemnations in the @entity7			1
the order , which will take effect on wednesday , poses a threat to thousands of @entity11 who will now be considered illegal under the new regulations			2
the new order is in fact an amendment to an existing order from 1969			0
it extends the definition of an infiltrator to " a person who is present in the area and does not lawfully hold a permit			0
" the order threatens those defined as infiltrators with deportation or imprisonment of up to seven years			0
it is unclear from the wording of the document -- signed six months ago by the commander of the @entity3 in the @entity5 at the time , maj. gen. @entity33 -- exactly who would fall under the new provisions			1
clauses in the order state that " a person is an infiltrator if he is present in the area without a document or a permit indicating his lawful presence in the area without reasonable justification			2
" a permit would be a document " issued by the commander of @entity3 forces in the @entity51 and @entity52 area or someone acting on his behalf , or issued by the authorities of the @entity56 , " according to the document , using the @entity56 terminology referring to the @entity5			1
the human rights organization @entity59 and nine other rights groups urgently appealed to the @entity56 defense minister , demanding postponement of the implementation of the order that the groups said " will turn all residents of the @entity5 into criminals			1
" chief @entity7 negotiator @entity68 said in a statement : " these military orders belong in an apartheid state			1
extensive in scope , they make it infinitely easier for @entity56 to imprison and expel @entity11 from the @entity5			2
they are an assault on ordinary @entity11 , and an affront to the most fundamental principles of human rights			0
" he added , " these orders have the effect of turning @entity11 into criminals in their own homes , while directly undermining the efforts of @entity11 to run their own internal affairs			2
they also open the flood gate for @entity56 to target foreign - born spouses , foreign workers , and even @entity56 citizens as ' infiltrators ' , as well as anyone participating in demonstrations in support of @entity7 rights and against @entity56 's occupation			1
" @entity68 said the order reveals " the invidious design behind @entity56 's settlement policy			0
" the fewer @entity11 there are in the @entity5 , including in occupied @entity0 , the more settlers there will be			0
@entity56 's endgame is not peace			0
it is the colonization of the @entity5			0
" an @entity3 spokesman told @entity1 : " the purpose of the order which was signed by the ... central command and which is scheduled to become affective on april 14th , is the extradition of those residing illegally in @entity51 and @entity52			1
this is a preexisting order which has no change with regard to who is illegal or illegal			1
there was a correction to ensure judicial oversight of the extradition process " .			0

rights groups say order turns all @entity5 residents into criminals
@entity7 negotiator : " these military orders belong in an apartheid state "
