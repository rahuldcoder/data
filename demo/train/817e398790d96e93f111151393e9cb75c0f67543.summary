-- @entity1 lives in the @entity2 , but his wife and three daughters are in @entity5			0
he has not been able to see them for seven years			0
@entity7 lives in @entity8 , but his grandmother , who raised him after his mother passed away , lives in @entity11			0
he has not been able to see her for more than two years			0
both long to visit their loved ones , but they can not -- they were placed on the no - fly list years ago			1
@entity1 and @entity7 do n't pose , have never posed and have never been accused of posing any threat to an airplane 's safety			2
unfortunately their stories are not uncommon			0
since 9/11 , the @entity22 government has placed thousands of individuals on the no - fly list			1
they have tried to pull themselves out of this kafkaesque web			0
the government has created a so - called trip process for challenging one 's placement on the no - fly list			1
you fill out an online form with basic information such as your name , birthday and flight number , and wait for the standard response : the agency has completed its review , and " no changes are warranted at this time			0
" but there is hope for change for people who are stuck on the list without reason : a federal court in @entity49 ruled this summer that the trip process was unconstitutional and criticized the government for failing to provide people with a meaningful opportunity to contest their no - fly list designation			1
in response to the court decision , the government stated this month that it would reform the process in an " endeavor to increase transparency			2
" these changes are long overdue			0
the no - fly list has existed for more than a decade in a shroud of secrecy with little accountability and even less oversight			1
and as @entity7 's and @entity1 's stories illustrate , the lack of an effective redress mechanism has had a devastating impact on individuals and their loved ones			0
but improving the redress process is only the first step			0
it is imperative also to look at the way watch listing authority is being abused			0
according to @entity1 and @entity7 , @entity78 agents privately offered an alternative option to get off the list			2
the @entity78 -- which in the post 9/11 - era measures success by the number of informants it can list -- told them if they were to spy on their neighbors and community , they might get off the no - fly list			1
as the clear project and the @entity91 alleged in a recent lawsuit , @entity78 agents repeatedly pressured @entity1 , @entity7 and two other men in this manner			0
" i do not want to become an informant , but the government says i must in order to be taken off the no - fly list , " @entity7 told us			1
" how can the government tell me that the only way i can see my family again is if i turn my back on my community ? " the @entity78 's response to the lawsuit has been , among other things , that its agents should be immune from suit			2
but that agents might be able to abuse the no - fly list in this manner is no surprise			1
recently , the government 's internal guidelines for placing someone on the no - fly list and other watch lists were leaked to the public , revealing for the first time just how prone to abuse the secretive list can be			1
two things are clear from the 166 - page document : first , nearly anyone can end up on the no - fly list , as the criteria for placement are shockingly broad and ill - defined			1
second , the decisions of agents who nominate people to the list are accorded a significant amount of deference			0
the government recently admitted in a court filing that the screening center rejected just 1 % of nominations last year			2
the no - fly list has expanded exponentially under such permissive rules			1
according to documents obtained by the digital magazine @entity144 , under the @entity146 administration , the number of people placed on the no - fly list has shot up to 47,000 people , a tenfold increase since the president took office			2
no one questions the need to secure aviation safety -- but stories such as @entity1 's and @entity7 's should give us all pause			0
there is a need to examine seriously the way in which law enforcement agencies are so easily able to abuse a powerful tool such as the no - fly list			1
while creating a more robust redress mechanism is an important first step , until the rules governing placement on the no - fly list are reviewed , and officers held accountable for unlawful tactics , we will all remain vulnerable to the whims of law enforcement agents .			1

writers : two men find themselves on @entity22 no - fly list for no *apparent* reason
writers say government rejected men 's challenge of status but gave option to spy on others
@entity187 says it will reform process , but authors say it must also address abuse of list
no - fly list a powerful security tool , and officials must be accountable for its use , they say
