-- all the talk at @entity2 has been about which drought would be broken			1
would world no. 1 @entity4 win his first major in five years ? could @entity6 complete his 18 - year quest for a major title ? no - one talked much about @entity10 , on his own personal mission to end a @entity13 quest that began in 1991 at @entity14			1
but at the 20th time of asking , the man known as ' @entity10 ' produced some of the most dynamic golf of his career to electrify the galleries and finally wrap his hands round the @entity22			1
four birdies on the final six holes saw @entity10 surge up the leaderboard , his last on the 18th green prompting tears as the enormity of his achievement sunk in			1
starting the day five shots off the lead he won his fifth major at a canter , three clear of @entity34 's @entity33 in second , with @entity6 joint third and @entity4 in a share of sixth			1
no wonder the 43 - year - old told the gallery at @entity2 it was his finest ever round , a glittering career now only lacking one of the four golfing majors , the @entity43			1
" it 's an amazing feeling , " @entity10 told a press conference			1
" i hit some of the best shots i 've ever hit , putted better than i 've ever putted			2
" i needed to show up and play some of the best golf of my career and that 's what i did			2
it 's a day i 'll always cherish			2
" i was behind the whole day			2
the putt at 13 was going to make the day go one way or another			0
it 's very hard to make birdies here			0
" i had to compose myself up to 18 because when i walking up to the green i realized this championship was in my control			0
that 's when i started to get emotional			0
" it 's a special moment to be a part of the history this championship			0
this has been the biggest challenge of my career to capture this trophy			0
" day three : woods hunting @entity6 the clear skies and bright sunshine that graced the opening three days of the 142nd @entity13 were absent by the time the final round began to form a decisive shape			1
as the majority of spectators alternated between the final two groups , @entity10 was steadily , and stealthily , winding his way through the field under a blanket of cloud on the @entity82 coast			1
he reached the turn at two - under , by which time the frontrunners had begun to shed shots			1
slowly but surely , the galleries got wind of his charge and made a beeline for @entity10			1
it was the 13th where the momentum swung his way , a birdie putt sparking a run that was to end with him posing for photos with the @entity22 as the main grandstand was enveloped in late afternoon gloom			0
another birdie on 14 moved him one shot behind then leader @entity99 , before two perfect blows to the par five 17th saw him infused with adrenalin as he seized the outright lead for the first time in the @entity104			1
by this time @entity99 had carded four consecutive bogeys , the same run that saw him relinquish the lead 12 months ago at @entity107 to allow @entity109 @entity108 to claim his second @entity13 title			1
another @entity10 birdie on the final hole saw him punching the air , hugging his caddy @entity114 and breaking down as he realized he 'd finally landed the one crown he was n't sure his game was equipped to deliver			1
it was his second victory in a week after he won the @entity118 and goes some way to repairing the desolation he felt after losing out on the @entity43 crown to @entity123 's @entity122 at @entity124 last month			0
for home hoppe @entity6 , the final day only served to reinforce the widely - held notion that his game is n't sturdy enough to close out a major championship			1
leading by two as he teed off in front of a supportive crowd at 2:10pm local time , he managed just one birdie and carded five bogeys			0
it meant he ended a 62nd major without topping the leaderboard , extending an unwanted record that weighs heavily around his neck			0
" i did n't play that badly -- probably not so well at seven , eight or nine , " he explained to reporters			0
" @entity10 must have played really well for five under par this afternoon , especially with a breeze going			1
that is a special finish in a major championship			0
" woods too will rue missed opportunities as he goes in search of the 15th title that will end his half - decade without a major championship			2
three birdies were canceled out by six bogeys and he could only watch from the 14th green as , only 30 yards away , @entity10 marched up the 17th on his way to a pivotal birdie to a rapturous ovation from the crowd			2
i played well , " @entity4 told reporters			2
" i could just never get the speed right today			0
" i had a hard time adjusting to the speeds			0
they were much slower today , much softer			0
i do n't think i got too many putts to the hole today			0
" i really had a hard time and left myself a couple of long lag putts early on when [ the wind ] was really blowing , and left them way short and did n't make those putts			2
