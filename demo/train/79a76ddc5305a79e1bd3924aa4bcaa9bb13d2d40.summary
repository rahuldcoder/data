@entity0 -- a key @entity3 negotiator said sunday that president @entity4 should drop his push for a government - funded public health insurance option because the @entity3 will never pass it			1
president @entity4 at a town hall meeting earlier this week pushing his health care reform plan			1
@entity11 sen. @entity10 of @entity12 said it was futile to continue to " chase that rabbit " due to the lack of 60 @entity3 votes needed to overcome a filibuster			1
" the fact of the matter is there are not the votes in the @entity3 for a public option			2
there never have been , " @entity10 said on " @entity23			2
" his comment signaled a shift in the health care debate , with @entity4 and senior advisers softening their support for a public option by saying final form of the legislation is less important than the principle of affordable coverage available to all			1
at a town hall meeting saturday in @entity37 , @entity4 said the public option is just one of many issues critical to successfully overhauling the ailing health care system			1
" all i 'm saying is ... that the public option , whether we have it or we do n't have it , is not the entirety of health care reform			1
this is just one sliver of it , " the president said			0
asked sunday if @entity4 would accept a bill lacking a public option , @entity49 spokesman @entity48 said the president insists on more competition in the health insurance marketplace to offer consumers better choices			1
" the bottom line ... is : do individuals looking for health insurance in the private market have choice and competition ? " @entity48 said on the @entity64 program " @entity65			2
" " if we have that , the president will be satisfied			0
" @entity70 secretary @entity69 echoed @entity48 , telling @entity1 's " @entity75 " on sunday that a final health care bill will include competitive choices for consumers in one form or another			1
" there will be a competitor to private insurers , " she said			0
" you do n't turn over the whole new marketplace to private insurance companies and trust them to do the right thing			0
we need some choices and we need some competition			0
" opponents of overhauling the health care system argue the @entity11 proposals under consideration by @entity90 go too far and will lead to a government takeover of the health care system			1
" we have the best health care system in the world , " @entity96 sen. @entity95 of @entity97 told " @entity23			1
" " we need to expand it			0
we do not need to destroy it			0
" at issue is how to provide coverage for an estimated 46 million uninsured people while reversing a climb in health care costs			1
@entity11 proposals passed so far by @entity49 and @entity3 committees include a public insurance option , mandates for people to be insured and employers to provide coverage , and an end to insurance companies refusing to cover pre-existing conditions			1
most republicans oppose the public option and requirements for employers to provide coverage			0
they also call for limits on medical malpractice lawsuits -- something @entity11 generally do n't favor			2
however , the two parties generally agree on a number of provisions contained in the @entity11 bills , including increased efficiency in @entity127 and @entity128 and focusing on preventive health programs			2
@entity10 is one of six @entity131 members -- three @entity11 and three @entity96 -- who are negotiating a compromise health care bill that would be the only bipartisan proposal so far			1
instead of a public option , the negotiators are considering a plan proposed by @entity10 to create nonprofit health insurance cooperatives that could negotiate coverage as a collective for their members			1
@entity10 said such cooperatives would provide the competition sought by @entity4 and @entity11 leaders to force private insurers to hold down costs and improve practices			1
the government would put up initial funding to provide required reserves but would have no other role , he said			0
" it 's not a public plan at all in terms of government running it , " @entity10 said			2
@entity95 called the cooperative idea a " step in the right direction " and " a far cry " from other proposals , adding that @entity4 and @entity11 leaders have " read the tea leaves " from town hall meetings around the country			1
however , @entity11 rep. @entity164 of @entity165 told @entity1 it would be " very , very difficult " to support a bill that lacked a public health insurance option			1
" without the public option , we 'll have the same number of people uninsured , " @entity164 said in a " @entity75 " interview			0
" if the insurance companies wanted to insure these people now , they 'd be insured			0
" she added that " an option that would give the private insurance companies a little competition " is " the only way " to be sure that insurance is available to low - income people and people without employer - provided coverage			2
meanwhile , leaders of organizations representing @entity189 's doctors and senior citizens defended the proposed health care overhaul that their groups had opposed in past years			2
dr. @entity193 , president of the @entity195 , and @entity196 of @entity197 -- formerly the @entity197 -- told " @entity23 " a comprehensive overhaul sought by @entity11 was necessary			2
" there are some moving parts that if you just do one and do n't do the other , you 're going to have unintended consequences , " said @entity193 , head of the nation 's largest doctors ' advocacy group			0
@entity196 , executive vice president of policy and strategy for the largest senior citizens ' advocacy group , said properly addressing excessive health care costs and waste requires addressing both health insurance coverage and how health care treatment is delivered			1
both men rejected accusations that a health care overhaul would bring rationing of health treatment based on bureaucratic measures such as cost and economic productivity of patients			2
" there 's a myth that rationing does n't occur right now , " @entity193 said , noting that some companies currently deny coverage for pregnancy as a pre-existing condition			0
" that 's why this bill is so important , " @entity193 said			0
" it gets rid of rationing happening right now " and leaves decisions to patients and doctors			0
@entity193 also condemned claims by some @entity96 that a provision in one @entity49 bill would lead to so - called " death panels " encouraging euthanasia of senior citizens			0
" that 's absolutely wrong , it 's a falsehood , " he said , adding that the provision was intended to provide government support for consultations between patients and their doctors			0
spreading of the " death panel " rumor by some conservative commentators and some @entity96 politicians prompted emotional opposition at town hall meetings across the country			0
@entity3 negotiators on a compromise bill say they have dropped the provision from their proposal due to potential misinterpretation of the intent .			0
