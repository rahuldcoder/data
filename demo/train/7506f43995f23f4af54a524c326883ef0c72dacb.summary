-- it has now been certified officially : @entity2 is special , at least in the eyes of ratings agency @entity4 's			2
according to @entity4 's , @entity2 is the only country in the eurozone which still deserves the prized @entity7 rating with a stable outlook			1
nine other countries , together accounting for more than half the euro area 's gdp , were downgraded at least one notch			2
given that these countries also provide more than half of the financing of the eurozone bail out fund ( the @entity18 ) it was only logical that this institution also lost its aaa rating			2
one could be tempted , following the downgrades , to conclude that most euro countries just can not get their fiscal houses in order			2
but the opposite is closer to reality			0
the average fiscal deficit for the euro area was only about 4 % of @entity10 in 2011			0
this is projected to fall to about 3 % in 2012			0
this is much lower than the double digit figures for the @entity35 and @entity36 fiscal deficits for 2011 , which are expected to persist through this year			0
@entity37 -- hit with a two - notch downgrade -- is actually expected to structurally balance its 2012 budget			0
" excessive " deficits are thus unlikely to be the root cause of the problem ( at least apart from @entity43 )			0
the motivation for the downgrades given by @entity4 's actually cites the excessive attention given to fiscal austerity as one principal reason for the downgrading of a whole swath of euroland			1
@entity43 debt talks to resume so why the downgrade ? is there really such a lack of capital that the remaining deficits , which look modest in comparison to other developed countries , can not be financed ? the answer is surely no. there are enough savings within the monetary union area to finance all public deficits of the eurozone 's members			1
this is because euro area savers are usually loath to invest in foreign currency ; and most regulated intermediaries such as investment fund have little choice but to invest in government securities in euro			0
further , @entity76 's investment funds and insurance companies can not all put their money in a bank account where yields are close to nothing			1
this is a key reason why reaction in the markets was so muted after the downgrades			1
so what is @entity4 's afraid of ? one major problem is @entity76 's regional split of savings habits			1
those in the north -- @entity2 and the @entity93 , for example -- have an excess of savings			2
but the area 's investors dare not cross the @entity98 to spend their money in the southern countries such as @entity37 , @entity100 and @entity43 ( and maybe soon @entity101 )			0
this is why @entity37 funding costs have gone up so dramatically while the same time , the @entity2 government can collect money from investors when it issues short term paper			0
the collection of savings within national pools means the capital markets have ceased to function in the euro area			0
the @entity113 is the only institution able to recycle northern @entity76 savings through the euro area			1
the @entity113 has thus become the " central counterparty " to most north - south lending in @entity76			1
by doing so it has prevented a collapse of the banking system			1
but the @entity113 has its limits too			1
the @entity113 can not single - handedly substitute for all private cross border lending			1
the downwards spiral will continue until these markets begin to function again			0
this should be the main priority of @entity76 's leaders			1
the fiscal compact might be useful to prevent the next crisis a generation down the road , but this will not be very useful if the euro does not survive the present one			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity137			2

@entity137 thinks the eurozone 's public finances are still in shape despite downgrades
@entity137 regards @entity76 's regional split of savings habits as one of the key problems in the crisis
the @entity113 has prevented a collapse of the banking system , but it has its limits
