@entity0 , a former @entity1 executive who sparked a firestorm of controversy on @entity4 , apologized sunday for her " needless and careless tweet " about @entity6			1
@entity0 apologized " for being insensitive to this crisis -- which does not discriminate by race , gender or sexual orientation , but which terrifies us all uniformly -- and to the millions of people living with the virus , i am ashamed			1
" she added that she is a native of @entity16 and was upset that she had hurt so many people there			0
" i am very sorry for the pain i caused , " she wrote			0
media company @entity21 " parted ways " saturday with @entity0 after the tweet , which read : " going to @entity16			1
hope i do n't get @entity6			0
i 'm white ! " " the offensive comment does not reflect the views and values of @entity21			1
we take this issue very seriously , and we have parted ways with the employee in question , " an @entity21 spokesman said in a statement			1
" there is no excuse for the hateful statements that have been made and we condemn them unequivocally , " he said			1
" we hope , however , that time and action , and the forgiving human spirit , will not result in the wholesale condemnation of an individual who we have otherwise known to be a decent person at core			0
" the tweet @entity0 sent before she left friday for @entity45 , @entity16 , went viral and created a social media firestorm			1
the incident -- @entity48 called it " the tweet heard round the world " -- was a glaring reminder that every word uttered on the internet can be heard by seemingly everyone on the @entity52 , sometimes with serious consequences			1
@entity0 was the head of corporate communications for @entity21 , the media company chaired by @entity60 that operates websites such as @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			1
her whole job revolved around communicating with reporters -- which made her @entity4 comment about @entity16 all the more shocking			2
@entity0 was in @entity69 and about to begin a long vacation in @entity16 when she wrote the message			0
her @entity4 account was relatively obscure when she posted it -- fewer than 500 people were following it			0
but the message went viral on friday , unbeknownst to @entity0 , who apparently did not have internet access on her flight			1
websites such as @entity79 and @entity80 highlighted @entity0 's account , and soon it had thousands of followers -- and thousands of harsh replies directed at it			0
others said they felt sorry for @entity0 , regardless of how offensive her @entity4 message was , because she had n't had a chance to defend herself during the 12 - hour flight			1
as @entity4 observers parsed through her public posts , many were disturbed by her previous messages			0
( " i had a sex dream about an autistic kid last night , " she once wrote			0
) her account was a laundry list of banal complaints about poor customer service and other apparent indignities			0
" it seems she has left a trail of casual racism across social media on her various travels , " @entity102 , a writer for @entity103 , opined			2
still , @entity102 wrote , " it was hard to ignore a disturbing feeling in the mob 's response " to the @entity4 messages " and something creepy in the trial by social media that was going on in her absence			2
" on friday afternoon , with hours to go before she landed , another corporate communications representative for @entity21 issued a statement that tried to address the online controversy			1
" this is an outrageous , offensive comment that does not reflect the views and values of @entity21 , " the company said			1
" unfortunately , the employee in question is unreachable on an international flight , but this is a very serious matter and we are taking appropriate action			2
" the statement led many to believe that @entity0 would be reprimanded or even terminated when she landed in @entity16			0
parody accounts started to appear on @entity4 and @entity134 that portrayed @entity0 as a mean , bitter person			0
on friday evening a @entity4 hashtag , # @entity137 , became a running commentary about @entity0 ; some people observed that she 'd have to put her crisis communications expertise to the test to save her own career			2
meanwhile , other @entity4 users started scoping out @entity0 's past messages and flagged other questionable comments she 'd made before , like this one : " i ca n't be fired for things i say while intoxicated right ? " all of those messages disappeared , though , early on saturday , when someone -- presumably @entity0 -- deleted her @entity4 account			2
@entity21 had no immediate comment about how or why her account was removed			1
some good does seem to have come out of the incident , at least			0
advocates for @entity6 relief set up websites to encourage donations ; one of the sites read , " the aids epidemic is bigger than a tweet from a person in @entity1 if we want real change , we need to think beyond @entity0			2
let 's turn that anger into something tangible			0
