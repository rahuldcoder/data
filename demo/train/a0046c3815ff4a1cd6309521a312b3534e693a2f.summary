this is truly one of the few things we agree on			0
in fact , a new @entity0 poll released earlier this week found that @entity1 has only a 10 % approval rating			1
when you think that 10 % of @entity9 believe @entity1 is doing a good job , you have to ask yourself one question : who are these people ? ! ( imagine this asked with true @entity15 exasperation			1
) @entity1 is so dysfunctional that dictators in other countries are probably pointing at it as an example of why you should never have a democracy			1
yet , somehow , about 30 million @entity9 are looking at what @entity1 is doing and thinking : " i like what i see			1
" if you actually think @entity1 is doing a good job , something is terribly awry in your life			1
people in your family need to stage an immediate intervention			2
i was so intrigued by these people who have such horribly low standards ( where were they when i was still dating ? ) that i went on to social media to find them			0
i posed questions on @entity34 and @entity35 asking if anyone is among this exclusive club known to me as the " @entity38			0
" what was the response ? no one admitted to it			0
but a few offered theories regarding who these people could be : " it 's probably friends and family of @entity1 , " @entity47 posted on @entity34			1
" ten percent of @entity9 are in a coma ? ! ? ! " @entity53 tweeted			0
i 'm pretty confident he 's not related to sen. @entity55			0
@entity56 tweeted a cynical but possibly accurate view : " some people just want to watch the world burn			2
" how could it be that no one knows who these people are ? could it be that those who said they approved of @entity1 were kidding ? perhaps the pollster asked , " do you think @entity1 is doing a good job ? " and they responded : " fabulous , " but they meant that sarcastically ? because all i can say is -- if you do know people who actually believe @entity1 is doing a good job , please watch over them carefully			1
these are the type of people that lead to warning labels on products like bleach that state " do not drink " and on blow dryers that read : " for external use only			0
" let 's get back to the real issue : @entity1			2
besides mocking it with lines like , " @entity1 is now less popular than syphilis , " what can actually be done to remedy the situation ? some say we should impeach or recall @entity1			2
well , you ca n't			0
the @entity93 only provides one procedure to remove members of @entity1			2
want to guess who decides on when that happens ? yup , it 's @entity1			2
it takes a two - thirds vote of @entity1 itself to expel a member			1
the only people who think that @entity1 would vote themselves out of a job that pays $ 174,000 a year plus health benefits are the 10 % of @entity9 who think @entity1 is doing a good job			1
can we realistically hope that since the congressional approval rating is so low that there will be a big house cleaning in the 2014 midterm elections on its own ? unlikely			1
even in 2012 , when @entity1 was riding " high " with an abysmal 18 % approval rating , did we see many members of @entity1 booted ? nope			1
in fact , 90 % of the members of @entity1 who sought re-election in 2012 won			1
the reality is that congressional districts have been crafted ( aka gerrymandered ) by state legislatures in an often grotesque fashion , rendering a large number of congressional seats uncompetitive			0
consequently , congressional reps have the freedom to be more unbearable and less compromising than ever before			0
so what else can we do ? some call for term limits -- which i think is a great idea -- although you never know if the same politicians would just be voted in again			0
and to implement that , we would have to amend the @entity9 @entity93			0
there are two procedures to do that : @entity1 starts the process by passing a resolution in support of the proposition with a two - thirds vote			1
@entity141 n't gon na happen			0
the other method is by way of a @entity144 called by two - thirds of the state legislatures			0
that is a possibility if a large grassroots movement emerged , but it 's challenging			0
not one of the 27 amendments to our @entity93 were enacted by this procedure			0
the easiest way is to effect change is to pledge to collectively put aside partisan politics and vote only for candidates in the 2014 primaries and general election who run on a platform of going to @entity1 to work in a bipartisan manner for our common good			1
it 's time we send home those people who would want the world to burn because it helps them get on tv and furthers their own political ambitions			2
if we do this , then one day we might have a @entity1 that not only has an approval rating above most venereal diseases , but one we can actually be proud of			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			2

@entity0 poll shows @entity1 has only a 10 % approval rating .
@entity178 asks " who are these people ? " and goes in search of them
nobody admitted to being a " @entity188 , " but lots of people speculated on them
@entity178 : vote out the bums who burn down government to advance their careers
