@entity0 -- @entity2 has clamped down on information once publicly available on listed and state - owned companies , hurting the effort of @entity7 investors and companies to gauge whether to invest in -- or short - sell -- @entity11 firms			1
first reported by the @entity13 , the @entity12 now requires company permission before accessing records such as financial reports and shareholder information			1
companies that sell credit reports -- which give companies a quick read on the background of the firm they are considering doing business with -- have been hindered , said @entity26 , managing director of @entity27 , an international business risk advisory firm in @entity2			1
" they are restricted now			0
they can not include personal identity information about individual shareholders or financial data from the last three years , " he said			0
" there is a major impact as many companies consume thousands of these reports every year , and that kind of information is no longer there , and it is not possible to get a reliable credit rating on this or that business partner without knowing how it 's performing financially and who owns it			0
" many believe the move may be in part a backlash against hedge funds like @entity52 , which prominently took down @entity11 timber company @entity53			1
the hedge fund has led similar short - selling crusade against other @entity57 - listed @entity11 firms such as including @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 , as @entity62 reported			1
all were delisted after @entity64 ' withering reports , with the exception of @entity58			0
but the information clampdown also comes at a sensitive time for @entity11 leadership as it readies for its once - a - decade transfer of leadership at the top as president @entity72 and premier @entity73 , who are both in their final year of office			2
also in the backdrop is the public rise and fall of @entity78 , a rising star who was dismissed as @entity80 chief of @entity81 , the biggest metropolis in @entity83			2
his right - hand man and former top cop @entity84 spectacularly sought refuge in an @entity57 consulate apparently fearing for his life and allegedly holding incriminating information on his old boss			0
his wife , @entity91 , is also being investigated on suspicion of murdering @entity93 businessman @entity92 in a " conflict over economic interests , " according to state media			0
subsequent reports suggest @entity78 's family was worth millions of dollars through business dealings and powerful political connections			0
difficulties getting access to information on companies " began at the beginning of this year , and it became a lot worse after the @entity78 scandal , " said @entity26 , who is founding president of the @entity102 in @entity83			1
" the people offering due diligence services to multi-nationals considering relationships with @entity11 companies are finding certain information to complete the picture is now missing when they are assessing a company for investment purposes , " he said			1
" this is a handicap to people investing in @entity83 right now			2
it is linked to the political atmosphere of this year 's leadership transition period , which has made @entity83 more tense , and the gathering of legitimate business information more sensitive			0
" the move to limit public information on companies comes after the april arrest of 1,700 suspects in a widespread crackdown on the illegal selling of personal information , the @entity127 reported , including an official in @entity137 who sold large amounts registered company information			2
@entity141 , which provides commercial information on businesses for credit checks , suspended its @entity146 - based market research company , @entity145 , earlier this year after allegations after a @entity11 report it illegally collected information on 150 million people , the @entity140 reported .			1

@entity83 now requires company permission before accessing *detailed* records
background checks on potential @entity11 investments have been hindered
some say move is in *response* to hedge funds who are shorting @entity11 companies
