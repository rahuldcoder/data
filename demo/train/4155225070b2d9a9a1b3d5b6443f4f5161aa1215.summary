-- vulgar comments , some laced with racial epithets			1
threats to him and his family			0
all of this and more -- stretched out over a season and a half -- proved too much for @entity10 , 24 , to bear , which is why he left the @entity12 last week , his lawyer said			1
" @entity10 endured harassment that went far beyond the traditional locker room hazing , " the attorney , @entity13 , said in a prepared statement			1
" ... these facts are not in dispute			2
" the comments , through the intermediary , break a silence from the offensive lineman who walked out after an incident in the team 's cafeteria and has n't been back since , according to @entity12 head coach @entity26			1
days later , @entity27 suspended @entity28 , 30 , for conduct detrimental to the team			0
rumors and news stories flew quickly in the days to come , including a well - publicized voice mail in which @entity28 reportedly calls @entity10 a racial epithet and threatens his life			1
@entity28 , @entity10 , and the @entity37 's future some also questioned the toughness of @entity10 , a @entity39 graduate who was in his second @entity37 season , especially as it came out that he might be seeking help for emotional issues			1
but @entity13 stressed : " @entity10 's toughness is not an issue			1
" " @entity10 started every game with the @entity12 since he was drafted in 2012 , " he said of the second - round draft pick			2
" at @entity39 , he was the anchor for @entity49 's ' smash mouth ' brand of football and he protected ( then - @entity39 , now @entity52 quarterback ) @entity54 's blind side			2
" the issue is @entity10 's treatment by his teammates			1
" @entity13 then outlined some of that treatment , including @entity10 's reaction to it			1
@entity10 tried " to befriend ... teammates who subjected him to the abuse with the hope that doing so would end the harassment " -- something that @entity13 called " a textbook reaction of victims of bullying			1
" it did n't work , the lawyer said			2
instead , there was more taunting , " a malicious physical attack on him by a teammate and daily vulgar comments , " and a threat of a group sexual assault against @entity10 's sister			1
" eventually , @entity10 made a difficult choice , " @entity13 said of @entity10 leaving the @entity12			1
" ... @entity10 looks forward to getting back to playing football			1
in the meantime , he will cooperate fully with the @entity37 investigation			0
" dolphins quarterback : @entity28 saw @entity10 as ' little brother ' @entity10 on leave ; @entity28 suspended that investigation is one part of the still evolving saga centered on @entity10 and @entity28 , plus more generally on the @entity12 team and the culture in @entity37 locker rooms			1
commissioner @entity95 has tapped veteran lawyer @entity96 -- who participated in a 2012 investigation of alleged sexual abuse at @entity99 and one that led to the change this year in who heads the @entity103 players union -- to lead the @entity37 's investigation			1
@entity13 , @entity10 's lawyer , also has a lengthy background in sports and law			1
that includes five years working for the @entity37 , being part of a top sports agency and serving as a top official for the @entity113 trading card and memorabilia company			0
besides continuing to work in the @entity117 law firm 's @entity115 out of @entity118 , @entity13 is also the executive director of the @entity119 , which represents " the interests of nearly 500 assistant coaches , " according to his official profile			2
@entity13 did n't immediately return a @entity0 request for comment friday on a potential conflict of interest , especially given a report from the @entity128 , a @entity129 newspaper , that @entity27 coaches asked @entity28 to toughen up @entity10 after the latter missed a voluntary workout			1
his client , @entity10 , is still on the @entity12 roster			2
@entity28 is the lone player suspended as a result of this ordeal , though @entity13 's statement alleges multiple players mistreated @entity10			1
@entity0 reached out multiple times to @entity28 but has n't received comment			0
but he did talk to @entity0 affiliate @entity141 outside a doctor 's office in @entity143 , @entity129 , on tuesday , saying , " you know , i 'm just trying to weather the storm right now			0
" @entity28 has a history of run - ins			0
they include a much - reported suspension from the @entity152 football team and his release by the @entity37 's @entity154 in december 2009 after an in - game argument with then - head coach @entity156			0
more recently , in 2012 , a volunteer at a golf tournament accused @entity28 of inappropriately touching her with a golf club , according to a newly disclosed police report			0
no charges were filed , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity162 , which first obtained the police report			0
@entity28 , @entity10 , and the @entity37 's future teammates : @entity10 , @entity28 seemed close @entity13 's comments about @entity10 seeking out friendships with some of his alleged tormenters did n't come from nowhere			1
rather , it is an apparent explanation for why a man would appear friendly with the same people who were allegedly abusing him			0
@entity12 quarterback @entity172 said wednesday that @entity28 considered @entity10 a " little brother " -- one who " messed with him but ... was the first one to have his back in any situation			1
" and the closeness appeared to be mutual			0
" i think if you had asked @entity184 a week before who his best friend on the team was , he would have said @entity28 , " @entity172 said			0
on the field , @entity28 would be " the first guy to stand up for @entity10 , " the quarterback said			2
and " outside of football , who was together ? @entity28 and @entity10			2
" describing @entity10 as a quiet guy who made a few jokes but was mostly business , @entity172 said " there were no warning signs " that something like this -- which he called " mind - blowing " -- was happening			2
@entity198 , another member of @entity27 's offensive line , similarly said he saw @entity28 and @entity184 as buddies , not bully and victim			0
" they hung out together , " @entity198 said			0
" they did a lot of stuff together			0
so if ( @entity10 ) had a problem with the way that ( @entity28 ) was treating him , he had a funny way of showing it			2
" @entity12 owner @entity211 has publicly insisted that the team takes " this situation seriously " and that he is " committed to creating a professional ( work ) environment			0
" and @entity26 , the club 's coach , says he 's ready to implement change if the @entity37 investigation finds his staff at fault			0
" if this review reveals anything that needs to be corrected , " he said , " we will take all necessary measures to fix it , to ensure that this does n't happen again			0
" @entity0 's @entity227 and @entity228 contributed to this report .			0
