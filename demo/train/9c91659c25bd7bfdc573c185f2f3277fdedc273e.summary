-- since the december 14 mass killing in @entity3 , we 've seen a lot of finger pointing			0
discussion of possible explanations is often neither civil nor constructive , and based on a closed - minded and entrenched belief that those who disagree with us have their facts wrong			2
the victims in @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 -- all killed or wounded by gun violence -- deserve better			1
there are two major ways we can zero in on facts and foster a more informed discussion			0
the first is to further develop and meaningfully consider high quality scientific research on violence prevention and mental health			1
the second is to create more opportunities for public policy discussions that incorporate this research			1
politics : new @entity35 , new push for gun laws the scientific literature regarding violence prevention is considerable			1
yet important research that focuses on gun violence has been shut down for political purposes			1
the @entity43 once considered gun violence a public health issue			1
the science agency had the freedom to ask important questions : does having a gun in the home make a family safer ? do concealed carry laws increase or reduce gun fatalities ? but in 1996 , the @entity54 pressured its many supporters in @entity35 to put the squeeze on the @entity43 by cutting funding that went to gun research , with the stipulation : " none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the @entity43 may be used to advocate or promote gun control			1
" gun - related research ground to a halt			1
in 2009 , scientists funded by the @entity68 looked into whether carrying a gun increases or decreases the risk of being shot in an assault			2
in 2011 , @entity73 rep. @entity72 inserted a provision into a funding bill that extended the @entity43 restrictions to the rest of the @entity78 , ending that similar research			1
even @entity80 has been touched by the @entity54 : the new health care law restricts doctors ' ability to collect data about patients ' gun use			1
" criticizing research is fair game , " drs. @entity87 and @entity88 wrote in opposition in the @entity90 last month			2
" suppressing research by targeting its sources of funding is not			2
" science and engineering research can answer important questions			2
for instance , can we cost - effectively engineer firearms to be used solely by the registered owner ? what 's the best way for law enforcement agencies to share gun violence data ? does media attention focused on the killers encourage copycat crimes ? does better access to mental health services reduce criminal activity ? some findings could lead to policy choices that are n't yet on the table or help determine where we should best focus our attention			1
republicans and @entity121 alike are warming up to the idea that adequate research can lead to more informed policy decisions			2
former rep. @entity125 , the @entity127 @entity126 who led the charge against the @entity43 in 1996 , recently expressed regret for suppressing firearm safety research			1
just as important , how do all these pieces of the puzzle fit together ? having an informed debate means relying on credible syntheses of expert studies			0
to come up with answers , scientific organizations , such as the @entity138 , could convene independent panels to piece together what is known and what is not known and to evaluate various policy options			2
the commission set up after the 2010 @entity145 oil spill is one such example			0
analysis : guns and the law when independent experts who are free from conflicts of interest come together in good faith to study an issue , they can have a profound and constructive influence on government policy			1
at a more basic level , national and state legislative committees should hold more hearings designed to study evidence rather than using hearings as theater to advance a political point of view			0
nongovernmental organizations , including the one where i work , can redouble their efforts to bring scientists and policymakers together			0
this is especially important after the demise of the @entity175 , a research office within @entity35 that , until the mid- 1990s , provided independent analyses on issues up for congressional debate			1
in the absence of a reliable base of information we can all agree on , we guess			0
we interpret the facts to suit our beliefs			0
we put our faith in the institutions or individuals we trust , whether it 's the @entity54 , religious leaders or gun control groups			1
and we keep on having the same broken debate			0
of course , the evidence can only take us so far			0
moral , economic , legal and political arguments can and should carry weight			0
but robust research can set the baseline for a discussion and help us make the best decisions for society			0
the more polarized , caustic and poorly analyzed an issue , the more intractable it becomes			0
we need to develop venues for rational discourse about research that is resilient to political pressures			0
more robust partnerships among scientists , policymakers and the public can help us work together to address critical challenges , even after they fall from the headlines			0
vice president @entity211 is leading a task force to address our country 's problem of gun violence			1
one critical step the task force should embrace is to lift restrictions on the research public health scientists can do			0
and we can all reject attempts to discredit evidence that challenges our beliefs			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .			2

@entity225 : we need scientific research on gun violence to inform policy
@entity225 : the @entity54 pressured @entity35 to end gun violence research at @entity43
researchers free from conflicts of interest should work with policy makers , he says
also , we must open our minds to findings that disagree with our beliefs , he writes
