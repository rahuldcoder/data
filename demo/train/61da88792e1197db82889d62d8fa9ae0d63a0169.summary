-- it used to be safe to say that most of us do n't go looking for crime on our vacations , but that 's not true anymore			2
crime fiction travel , a juicier version of the well - worn literary pilgrimage , is a popular way for people to see the world			0
" a lot of people read crime fiction in advance of visiting a new city			0
once there , i think it 's natural to see how the real place aligns with the one on the page , " says best - selling crime novelist @entity17 , whose main character @entity18 is a reporter turned private investigator living and working in @entity21			1
a sense of place is vital to creating realistic crime fiction , but writing about a place people know and can visit presents challenges , notes @entity17 , a former @entity32 reporter			2
" if you want to write about a real place , you better get it right , or you 'll hear about it , " she says			0
when authors succeed , their books and characters can become forever linked with the locations in which the books are set			0
here are five destinations whose local authors get it right			0
grit on wry : a dinner with @entity48 and @entity49 @entity21 thanks to her @entity18 series , including the @entity53 - winning " @entity52 , " @entity17 has become an ambassador for her home city of @entity21			1
when the city hosted the annual @entity58 in 2008 , a self - guided tour of " @entity17 's @entity21 " was developed for fans who wanted to see the sights the way @entity62 sees them			1
one destination is the @entity65 neighborhood where @entity62 lives , and even manages to detect crime while bedridden , " @entity68 " style , in 2011 's " the girl in the @entity70			2
" other tours cover neighborhoods north and south of @entity21 's @entity73 in downtown @entity21 and include local landmarks such as the @entity75 , which @entity17 mentions in most of her books			1
among the qualities that endear @entity62 to fans are her unabashed love of food and her loyalty to her favorite neighborhood haunts			1
they include the @entity84 and @entity86 's @entity85 in @entity65 , @entity87 south of the @entity73 and @entity88 , where @entity17 recommends the crab pe			2
author uncovers thrilling world of ' @entity92 ' @entity93 , @entity94 @entity94 and the mind fills with images of bucolic farms and snow - covered mountains			1
crime novelist @entity99 , who also works as a death investigator for @entity94 's @entity102 and as a detective for the @entity104 ( @entity94 ) @entity105 , sees those things and others			1
his police detective protagonist @entity108 is more than likely to gaze out at the @entity109 near @entity93 and find a body floating on the surface , as was the case in @entity99 's 2007 novel " chat			1
" @entity93 , @entity108 's home turf , embraces its position as @entity94 's fictional crime center and the entire state of @entity94 embraces @entity99			1
at 12 @entity119 , including @entity120 on @entity121 near @entity93 and @entity122 on @entity123 between @entity124 and @entity125 , a new lending library program lets visitors pick up a print or audio edition of an @entity99 novel to enjoy while they travel and to return when they 're done			0
lodging packages with an archer mayor / mystery fiction theme are available in @entity93 , @entity125 , @entity133 and @entity134			0
the @entity135 takes place in october			0
the past year has not been kind to @entity93			0
a fire severely damaged the historic @entity139 hotel and much of the town 's @entity140 , and rains from @entity143 flooded the downtown area			2
but @entity94 's natural beauty remains unblemished			1
@entity146 , @entity147 five years ago @entity148 retired his @entity146 detective @entity149 when the fictional character reached mandatory retirement age for @entity147 police			1
yet after 20 years and 18 @entity155 novels , @entity148 and his hard - driving detective had become indelibly linked to @entity146			2
since 2000 , @entity156 has offered two - hour guided walking tours that start at @entity149 ' favorite pub , the @entity159 , and incorporate readings from the @entity149 novels plus mentions of other local writers , @entity163 and @entity164 among them			1
@entity148 has his own interactive @entity149 ' @entity146 map at his website , and he recently updated his @entity148 's @entity146 app , available on @entity168 and @entity169			1
one reason for this flurry of activity is the hotly awaited return of his detective			2
" @entity149 : standing in @entity178 , " a new @entity149 novel , will be released in the @entity176 in november and in the @entity177 in january 2013			1
@entity148 fans visiting @entity147 in september should also take advantage of @entity181 , an annual program that offers access to buildings and sites not usually open to the public			2
the scheme inspired @entity148 's 2008 stand - alone art heist novel " @entity181			2
" a tv adaptation of that novel , starring @entity191 , is in production			0
@entity193 , @entity194 @entity195 helped devise the tours based on his no. 1 ladies ' detective agency novels that have been run by @entity198 since 2003			1
the novels , which feature @entity200 , a " traditionally built " woman of unspecified age , are so charming and gentle it might be surprising to learn that many of the characters and places mentioned in them are drawn directly from real life			1
stops on the tour vary but typically include @entity200 's house on @entity210 ( a private residence ) , her birthplace in the village of @entity212 , and a visit to the " orphan farm " where @entity200 meets @entity215 and @entity216			1
( @entity217 and @entity218 are the formal terms of greeting and respect for women and men , respectively , in @entity194			0
) the full - day tours have changed over the years as more books have been written — the newest in the series , " the @entity227 " was released in april — but the core tour stops come from the earlier books and a cup of @entity200 's favorite red bush tea is always on the itinerary			1
half - day tours , walking tours and two - day tours that include a visit to the @entity237 also are available			1
@entity238 we can thank @entity238 for the current popularity of crime fiction tours ; the country is rife with them			0
even the beautiful , tiny fishing village of @entity245 in the @entity247 region of @entity238 , which typically sees its population drop to 1,000 individuals in the off - season , now receives a steady of flow of visitors who want to see the locations mentioned in @entity257 's best - selling @entity256 novels , starting with " the ice princess			0
" @entity260 's inspector @entity259 is resentful about working in @entity261 , a small city in the @entity263 region of southern @entity238 that he considers a backwater			0
yet visitors now flock to @entity261 from all over the world for the " in the @entity269 " self - guided tour			0
( you can follow the route by map or by app. ) the tours feature locations from the books and from both the @entity278 and @entity176 tv series based on them			0
( " @entity280 , " starring @entity281 , will air on @entity282 " in september with episodes based on " an event in @entity285 , " " @entity286 " and " @entity287			0
" ) not surprisingly perhaps , the most popular crime fiction tours in @entity238 are the @entity290 tours based on the @entity291 by @entity292			0
the @entity293 sells maps for self - guided @entity295 and conducts two - hour guided tours focusing largely on the residential @entity298 neighborhood where fictional journalist @entity299 works and where fictional computer hacker @entity300 lives			2
it hardly matters that @entity299 and @entity300 do n't " work " or " live " in a real sense ; " @entity306 " and its sequels made them real enough for travelers to want to visit them			0
