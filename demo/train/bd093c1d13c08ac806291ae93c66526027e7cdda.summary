@entity0 -- up , up and away			0
way away -- to the moon , in fact			0
@entity4 launched an experimental spacecraft early friday that is scheduled to orbit the moon before returning to @entity8 , a first for the country 's ambitious space program and considered a precursor to a planned mission to the moon			1
the unmanned spacecraft was launched by a @entity17 rocket from the @entity18 in @entity19 , western @entity4 , state media said			1
it is @entity4 's first lunar module capable of returning to @entity8 and the mission 's main technical challenge will be making sure the spacecraft slows down enough to re-enter @entity8 's atmosphere safely			1
too fast and it could overheat or become difficult to track and control , @entity28 , chief designer of the lunar exploration program , told the @entity30			0
it is expected to take around a week to fly around the moon			0
the spacecraft will end its mission by landing on the grasslands of @entity36			0
the mission tests technology that will be used in a more ambitious launch , scheduled to take place in 2017 , when an unmanned lunar probe will go to the moon , collect soil samples and return home			1
@entity4 astronauts have made five manned space flights on a series of @entity48 " modules , with the latest mission in 2013 completing a successful manual docking with the @entity52 space station			1
last december , @entity4 put a lunar rover -- known as the @entity54 -- on the moon but it has been plagued by mechanical troubles , the @entity30 said			2
on course for the moon ? @entity59 , a professor at the @entity60 , said the lunar orbiter marks a step forward in the capabilities needed for a potential manned lunar program , which while under discussion has n't been officially approved yet			0
" it 's significance is not only in demonstration of technical abilities , but in a continued political will to achieve its space goals over long periods of time â € ” which is what @entity4 has that the @entity76 currently lacks			2
" while the @entity76 has pulled back its space program , other countries are trying to match or surpass @entity4 's accomplishments in what some observers have called an @entity83 space race			1
in september , @entity84 became the first @entity83 country to send an orbiter around @entity87			0
political symbolism @entity4 sent its first astronaut into space in 2003 and has made rapid advances in the intervening decade			2
despite this , its space program is still yet to achieve capabilities reached by the @entity76 and then @entity95 decades ago , says @entity96 , director and senior fellow at the @entity99 - based @entity98			2
with little economic or military advantage , its value , he says , lies in how the space program shapes @entity4 's perception of itself -- a conspicuous display of national power and wealth that asserts @entity4 's return to confidence and authority			1
" we could ask if @entity4 is following an outdated recipe for superpower status , " he writes in a blog for the @entity111 in the @entity112			0
" in terms of the global effect of the manned program , there might be some truth to this			0
but for the domestic audience that is the chief concern of @entity4 's leaders , the space program produces invaluable results			1

new : @entity4 launched an experimental spacecraft on friday
new : the spacecraft will orbit the moon before returning to @entity8
mission tests technology that will be used in a more ambitious space mission
@entity4 's space program hopes eventually to send a man to the moon
