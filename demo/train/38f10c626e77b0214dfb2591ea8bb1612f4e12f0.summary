editor 's note : @entity2 is a senior policy analyst in the @entity3 at the @entity4 , a @entity5 - based think tank that seeks innovative solutions across the political spectrum			1
@entity2 says @entity8 have no choice but to increase the amount they save			1
@entity5 ( @entity11 ) -- as the economy slows , millions of @entity8 will cut their budgets to stay afloat			1
this generates conflicting impulses : if i skip that morning coffee and granola , will my thriftiness put my local coffee shop out of business ? will that force @entity8 's granola farmers to lay off workers ? what 's a budget - conscious , patriotic and hungry girl to do ? not to worry , saving a few dollars now will not prolong the recession			1
and , more important , spending all your discretionary income will not end the recession			0
it 's true that @entity36 ' " @entity35 " suggests that , even while saving is beneficial to an individual , too much aggregate savings could deepen an ordinary recession			1
but in these extraordinary times , where banks and not just businesses are in desperate need of cash , this economic rule may not fully hold			0
more important , individuals need savings to be prepared for unanticipated expenses and income losses , especially now			2
the reality is that there is no bailout coming to you			0
and those getting the bailout might not be willing to lend to you , anyway			0
so now is the time to save			0
the money you save is your own personal safety net , what you tap when you have an unanticipated expense like a car repair or when you 're between jobs , as many @entity8 find themselves nowadays			1
the past decade has seen @entity8 saving at historically low levels ; we 've substituted plastic for the piggy bank			1
but the days of cheap and easy access to credit have come and gone			0
we all need to save not because we want to but because we have to			0
for decades , our country 's economy has flourished , but it relied too heavily on debt - driven consumer spending to power its growth			2
excessive household debt , coupled with stagnating incomes and little to no personal savings , now places @entity8 in a precarious position			1
compared with the 19 other major industrialized economies , the @entity8 ranks dead last for personal savings			1
that 's right , in 2003 , the @entity8 was the least thrifty nation among the @entity82			1
why is it important that we save more as a nation ? savings offers us the protection we need to make it through hard or uncertain times and to pay for important future needs such as a home , education or adequate retirement			2
savings also creates pools of capital for investment purposes ( who will fund the next neighborhood coffee shop ? ) and to keep interest rates low			2
it appears the current recession has scared us back to saving ; we are no longer spending all of our disposable income			2
to ensure that the hopeful trend continues , government and employers should adopt a new generation of savings policies that are both innovative and simple			1
common sense , along with research from the emerging field of behavioral economics , tells us why we are n't saving more already : 1 ) we like instant gratification whether it 's iphones or our paychecks , we want everything , and we want it now			2
we are so short - term - oriented that many of us would rather have a fatter paycheck now than set aside some of that happiness , even if the funds will be greater in the future			2
2 ) we tend to procrastinate once we start something ( or fail to start something ) , it 's really hard to change course			0
and we 'd prefer a hassle - free world			0
who does n't , right ? when it 's hard just to figure out how to start saving , most people wo n't			0
however , the flip side is that when it 's easy to start saving , a lot more people will			0
think about current retirement savings			0
how many of us would open an account and make regular deposits if an employer did n't take it right out of our paychecks ? when it comes to savings , we need someone to save us from ourselves			1
smart savings policies should be automatic and utilize smart pre-made choices , or defaults			0
it would require action to not save			0
of course , this type of policymaking underscores the importance of making the default choice a good one ( an adjustable - rate mortgage with no down payment would be an example of a bad default )			0
employers can easily help their employees save for a rainy day , leveraging the payroll system and direct deposit to automatically send a small percentage of their paychecks to a savings account			1
this type of unrestricted savings is especially valuable for individuals who have limited liquid assets and who may otherwise be forced to meet emergency cash needs with high - cost payday loans			1
a truly transformative savings policy to broaden the base of @entity8 savers would encourage it from birth with @entity177			1
these " start in life " accounts would be " seeded " up - front with a modest initial deposit ( $ 500 ) , progressively funded for children born into lower - income households and restricted for specific asset - building uses like higher education , purchasing a home or starting a small business			0
for the economic health of the next generation , the @entity8 should join the @entity190 and @entity191 , and others who are offering such lifelong savings accounts , and get some skin in the thrift game , too			1
we know it 's plenty hard to save ; it feels a lot like we 're taking away what we 've rightly earned			0
taking advantage of windfall payments such as tax refunds is important , and so is removing the temptation to spend all of that refund			1
tax filers can pre-commit a portion of their refund before it reaches their pocket to up to three accounts ( including savings accounts ! ) with @entity213 form 8888			1
having accessible savings is critical to our personal and economic security			0
we must reorient the savings policy discussion to include the needs of shorter - term savers and consider policy that would make savings automatic and universal at birth			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity8 saves less than nearly all big countries
she says crisis is forcing an increase in savings by @entity8 families
@entity232 - @entity2 : government , firms should automatically encourage saving
she says you can *designate* part of a tax refund to go into a savings account
