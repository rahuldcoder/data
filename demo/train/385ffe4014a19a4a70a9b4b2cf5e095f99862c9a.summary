he horsey danced his way to the top of the @entity4 music chart -- and @entity6 domination may not be far behind			1
@entity14 's viral " @entity13 " hit the top spot sunday , marking the first time that a @entity10 singer has climbed the @entity12 singles chart			1
in the @entity6 , @entity14 remains at number 2 , behind @entity16 in the @entity17 100 as of monday morning			1
@entity17 has a @entity18 on its website , on whether he 'll reach the top spot			1
and this weekend , the @entity21 inmates of the @entity22 , famous for their performance of @entity25 's " @entity24 , " gyrated and air lassoed their version of " @entity13			1
" the catchy tune that launched what seems like a thousand parodies , has likely replaced @entity32 's " @entity31 " as the most lip synched song this year			0
psy : my video 's more popular than me ! last week , " @entity13 " snatched the @entity38 for the " most liked " @entity40 video ever			2
it has over 335 million views and dominates the @entity43 in the @entity6 , @entity12 , @entity44 and several @entity46 countries			0
tributes continue to flood @entity40 with performances by the @entity50 's marching band , a @entity52 flash mob and a @entity10 - @entity6 mother primly dancing alongside her son in what 's called " @entity56			2
" and yes , even a parody from the @entity10 government			0
whether you 're sick of " @entity13 " or ca n't get enough of it , @entity14 seems ubiquitous -- popping up on " @entity61 " and @entity63 's @entity62 , and signing with @entity65 's manager			2
@entity14 's song -- about the wannabe style of the affluent neighborhood of @entity13 in @entity69 -- has been sliced and diced with theories about what it means about wealth and class in @entity75 , and questions about whether @entity14 embodies the stereotypes about @entity79 masculinity			1
psy is a slight departure from the usual @entity10 pop stars , who are typically svelte , impeccably dressed and very serious about their dance moves			0
instead , it 's @entity14 , a portly man who likes to mimic @entity86 and @entity87 performances while wearing sparkly leotards , who broke into the @entity91 pop psyche			0
" i think foreigners think i 'm funny , the way @entity10 people think @entity96 and @entity97 are funny , " he told @entity92 .			0

" @entity13 " hits top spot in @entity4 singles chart , first for a @entity10 singer
the song , made famous through @entity14 's viral video , is number 2 in @entity17 chart
