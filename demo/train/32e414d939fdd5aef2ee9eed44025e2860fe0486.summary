the suspect , maj. @entity10 , remained in intensive care at @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity1			1
in a statement issued monday night , the @entity3 said its investigation so far " indicates that the alleged gunman acted alone and was not part of a broader terrorist plot			1
" thursday 's shooting left 13 dead , 12 of them @entity9 soldiers , and 42 wounded			0
read more about the victims @entity10 , a @entity9 - born citizen of @entity24 descent , was a licensed psychiatrist who joined the @entity25 in 1997			1
he was promoted to major in may and was scheduled to deploy to @entity26 sometime soon , but had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military			0

a neighbor was charged with criminal mischief after that complaint			0
but the @entity3 disclosed that @entity10 came to its attention as part of an unrelated terrorism probe in december 2008 , when agents reviewed " certain communications between @entity43 and the subject of that investigation			1
" the intercepts " raised no red flags , " with no mention of threats or violence that would have triggered a @entity9 terrorism investigation , senior investigative officials said monday			0

@entity68 , who left the @entity9 in 2002 and is believed to be living in @entity69 , was the subject of several federal investigations dating back to the late 1990s , but was never charged			0
military officials told @entity2 on monday that intelligence agencies intercepted communications from @entity10 to @entity63 and shared them with other @entity9 government agencies			2
but federal authorities dropped the inquiry into @entity10 's communications after deciding that the messages warranted no further action , one of the officials said			1
according to the @entity3 , investigators from one of its @entity84 determined " that the content of those communications was consistent with research being conducted by @entity43 in his position as a psychiatrist at the @entity91 [ in @entity67 ]			1
" @entity10 was first an intern , then a resident and finally a fellow at @entity91 before moving to @entity0			1

fbi director @entity101 has ordered a review of the matter , the @entity3 said			2
the independent commission that investigated the 9/11 attacks found @entity63 was a " spiritual adviser " to two of the hijackers in that plot , @entity111 and @entity112 , while @entity63 was at the @entity66 mosque and earlier , in @entity107			1

" the quiet , very peaceful person coming in and out of the mosque , i could n't believe he could have done this , " @entity134 told @entity2			2
three senior investigative officials , who insisted they not be identified by name because of the sensitive nature of the ongoing federal investigation , told reporters in @entity67 that @entity10 was never nominated to be on a watch list			2
he was able to purchase weapons legally and had done nothing to justify even a preliminary investigation , they said			0
in addition , @entity10 had a security clearance at the " secret " level and received good performance reviews , they said			2
nonetheless , they continued to examine his communications with the cleric in @entity69 for several months as a precaution			0
authorities have not identified a motive in thursday 's attack			2
but at @entity0 the post commander told reporters he has ordered his officers to " immediately take a hard look and make sure if there 's anybody out there struggling			1
" " @entity10 was a soldier and we have other soldiers ... that might have some of the same stress and indicators that he has , " lt. gen. @entity166 said			2
" we have to look across our entire formation , not just in a medical community but really look hard to our right and left			0
that 's the responsibility for everybody from the top to the bottom to make sure we 're taking care of our own			0
" @entity25 officials have voiced concern about jumping to any conclusions about @entity10 's motive , warning about a possible backlash against @entity29 soldiers			1
but several witnesses , like pvt. @entity187 , who was wounded in the hip during the attack , reported @entity10 shouted " @entity190 " -- @entity191 for " @entity192 is great " -- which @entity120 terrorists have used as a battle cry			1

" the @entity25 leadership at @entity0 will " take a very hard look at ourselves and look at anything that might have been done to have prevented this , " @entity166 said monday			2
