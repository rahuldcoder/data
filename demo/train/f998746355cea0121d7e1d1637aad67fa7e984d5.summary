-- sen. @entity1 should be toast by now			1
she 's a @entity2 in @entity4 - leaning @entity3 , voted for @entity5 and is under fire for skipping a meeting of the @entity8 to attend a campaign fundraiser -- a no no in a state with a large military presence			1
her @entity4 opponent , @entity13 , is also trying to tie her to the @entity17 administration 's uneven @entity15 response			0
yet @entity1 is surprisingly strong going into next month 's election , slightly ahead in most polls at a time when other southern @entity21 are in serious danger of losing their seats			1
her durability is cheering @entity21 in an otherwise miserable year and giving the party a playbook for how to make @entity3 competitive during the 2016 presidential election			1
" @entity3 is a political fulcrum on which the nation 's politics balances , " said @entity29 , a @entity30 state senator			1
potential 2016 contenders are paying close attention to this year 's @entity8 race			1
@entity37 will join @entity1 at a @entity39 rally on saturday			1
sen. @entity40 , a @entity41 @entity4 , has campaigned in the state for @entity13 to win , @entity1 will have to solidify the coalition from 2008 that helped @entity17 spring a surprise and become the first @entity2 to win @entity3 in a presidential election since @entity46			1
the president won the state by turning out record numbers of @entity50 along with young , well educated voters moving to @entity39 and the high - tech " @entity52 " of @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			0
but that base thinned in 2012 , returning the state to @entity4			0
" it may be that @entity3 becomes a bona fide swing state , " said @entity59 , a political scientist at @entity60			1
@entity1 is hoping to rev up the base by lambasting @entity13 , who is currently the state house speaker , over his unpopular legislature 's policies on education and women 's issues			1
she ca n't afford for any democrats to stay home , as often happens in midterm elections			0
opinion : 4 ways @entity21 have already won the midterms @entity50 turnout -- which could diminish without @entity17 on the ballot -- will again be crucial and @entity21 are furious about new voter registration laws which they say discriminate against their core supporters			2
winning the @entity3 battleground wo n't be easy â € ” or cheap			1
the @entity8 race is attracting a record amount of outside money -- $ 55.7 million , according to the @entity84			0
a @entity86 analysis of data collected by @entity89 / @entity88 found @entity90 have been deluged by nearly 80,000 television ads in a preview of what could be an even costlier presidential campaign in two years time			0
the intensity will only increase in 2016 if each party thinks the state is up for grabs			0
for @entity4 , maintaining their grip on @entity3 is vital			2
they would have a hard time finding a path to the @entity104 without it			0
" this notion that it used to be a deep red state that is now going @entity30 ... is just not an accurate picture of reality , " said @entity105 , president of the open market @entity107			0
" @entity3 is likely to be highly competitive , but i do n't see it turning blue , " he said , noting that the state has in the past sent both staunch conservatives like @entity115 and liberals like @entity117 to the @entity8			2
@entity4 see a 2014 victory in @entity3 as a crucial bulwark against @entity30 encroachment on the coastal south in 2016			1
a loss now would inevitably spark tough questions about the party 's viability in national elections			2
@entity13 campaign sources say they learned the lesson of @entity17 's mighty turnout machine in 2008 and have spent a year building a field operation			2
they believe the infrastructure left behind by @entity17 has frayed and see the state @entity30 as disorganized			0
but the @entity1 campaign says it has enrolled 10,000 volunteers to identify supporters and make sure they vote			1
but the @entity15 outbreak is transforming the contours of the race , underscoring how quickly the state 's political ground can shift			0
@entity4 are slamming @entity1 for finally backing an entry ban for citizens of west @entity50 nations afflicted by @entity15 after she earlier adopted the @entity104 position that travel restrictions would not work			2
her delayed flip flop showed a " lack of leadership and an unwillingness to stand up to president @entity17 when he is wrong , " said @entity13 spokesman @entity151			0
@entity1 is staying focused on the party 's core issues , calling @entity13 " abysmal " on women 's issues and " spineless " on global terror			1
" at every step , he 's fought for policies that are taking our state backwards , " @entity1 said in a debate in which she positioned herself a moderate			1
her survival strategy relies on making @entity13 a bigger bogeyman than @entity17 , so she slams him as the enforcer of the @entity4 power monopoly in @entity54 , and distances herself from the president by backing the @entity168 pipeline and opposing trade deals			0
while she is a sitting senator running for re-election , @entity1 is in effect making @entity13 the incumbent and has infuriated republicans by charging the @entity13 - led legislature slashed $ 500 million in education funding			2
@entity4 believe they 've blunted that line of attack with a series of ads but @entity1 is keeping it up -- hoping that criticizing @entity13 on education will be potent in a state that prides itself on its university system			2
@entity1 has also lacerated @entity13 on contraception and goaded him into dismissing a federal equal pay bill as a " gimmick			0
" her efforts opened a gender gap of 12 percent among women voters , according to a @entity190 poll			0
" women voters will be the key to her victory in november , " said @entity191 , national press secretary for @entity192 , which has poured $ 3 million into the race .			0

@entity1 is slightly ahead in most polls going into next month 's elections
@entity1 's strength could *provide* @entity21 a playbook for winning @entity3 in 2016
@entity37 will campaign with @entity1 on saturday
