-- two astronauts conducted a spacewalk saturday to address an ammonia leak in the @entity5 's cooling system , a mission that ended with @entity8 optimistic the potentially major problem had been fixed			1
in addition to inspecting the site of the leak , @entity8 astronauts @entity9 and @entity11 removed and replaced a 260 - pound pump controller box , @entity8 explained			1
afterward , @entity9 and @entity11 could n't detect any sign of a leak -- which might have been manifest , in this case , as ammonia snow flakes -- when space agency officials back on @entity21 ran the new pump			1
still , @entity8 noted that the area needs to be monitored long - term to prove that the problem has been fixed			2
" no leaks ! " tweeted @entity25 of @entity26 , the space station 's commander , who choreographed the spacewalk			2
" we 're bringing @entity11 & @entity9 back inside			0
... this is an amazing place & time			0
" the entire spacewalk took 5 hours and 30 minutes -- an hour less than expected			1
first detected early thursday morning , the leak was causing ammonia to enter space at a rate of 5 pounds per day , @entity37 , @entity8 's space station program manager , told reporters friday			1
ammonia is used to cool the solar arrays that provide electricity to station systems			2
the discovery spurred teams at @entity8 , over a busy 24 - hour stretch , to go into " a full - court press to understand what the failure is " and how to address it , @entity8 flight director @entity44 said friday			1
that set the stage for the spacewalk involving three of the space station 's six - man crew			1
the leak was in a cooling loop in a solar array that has leaked before , and astronauts tried to fix it in november			2
it 's unclear whether the leak detected this week was the same one or a new issue			2
the ammonia coolant for the power channel , one of eight used to supply electricity to the station , would likely have run out by late friday morning had it not been shut down , @entity8 said			0
" it is a serious situation , but between crew and experts on the ground , it appears to have been stabilized , " @entity25 tweeted thursday			0
still , the space station 's crew -- which also includes three @entity77 cosmonauts -- were never in danger because of it , @entity8 said			0
moreover , the agency has said the rest of the orbiter was otherwise operating normally			0
both @entity11 and @entity82 are scheduled to leave the space station at 7:08 p.m. et monday with @entity77 cosmonaut @entity84 , and @entity8 said friday that the spacewalk would n't affect those plans			1
@entity9 and @entity77 cosmonauts @entity88 and @entity89 will stay behind			0
they 'll eventually be joined by @entity8 astronaut @entity90 , @entity77 cosmonaut @entity91 and @entity93 astronaut @entity92 , who are due to launch aboard a @entity77 soyuz spacecraft on may 28			0
@entity0 's @entity95 contributed to this report .			0

2 astronauts did a spacewalk to address ammonia leaking from the @entity5
they inspected the site of the leak and replaced a pump controller box on the orbiter
afterward , *initial* tests showed no sign of a continuing leak , which was *spotted* thursday ,
3 of the 6 men involved in the *5Â½* - hour spacewalk are set to leave for @entity21 on monday
