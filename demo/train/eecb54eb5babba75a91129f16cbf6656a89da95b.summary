space and back might just be the answer			2
@entity12 - based space travel company @entity11 says it plans to offer a trip to the edge of space in a luxurious eight - seat capsule for $ 75,000 per ticket			1
it 's somewhat more affordable considering @entity3 charges $ 250,000 , which also includes three days of training and two and a half hours in space			0
the capsule will be lifted by a high altitude balloon that will rise up to about 30 kilometers ( 98,425 feet or almost 20 miles ) and stay aloft for two hours before returning back to @entity20 , according to a company press statement			1
quiz : do you have the smarts to be a space tourist ? that is not as high as @entity6 's jumping point ( 128,100 feet or around 39 kilometers ) last year but much higher than one can usually reach -- the average altitude for commercial flights is about nine or ten kilometers above ground , or 30,000 to 40,000 feet			1
" passengers will be among the few to have seen the curvature of the @entity20 with their own eyes , " the statement touted			0
" they will be able to gaze at the astounding views , the blackness of space , the brilliance of stars and the thin veil of atmosphere enveloping our planet			0
" the first flight is planned for 2016			0
component testing has already begun and sub-scale testing will soon be carried out as well , the company says			0
the space capsule will be developed by @entity50 , which is developing technology for @entity52 , a 501 - day mission around @entity54			1
