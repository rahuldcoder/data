@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity7 police questioned four members of the @entity5 national cricket team after allegations surfaced that gamblers fixed part of a match against @entity1 , the manager of the @entity5 team said sunday			1
they arrested a different man in connection with the allegations late saturday			1
the investigation comes after a @entity7 tabloid newspaper reported that two @entity5 players deliberately bowled " no balls " -- a foul -- while playing against @entity1 in @entity0 last week			1
a " no ball " is when the bowler -- the equivalent of a pitcher in baseball -- steps over the line as he throws the ball			2
the batting team gets a run when that happens			1
a chance lost for @entity36 's cricketers ? the @entity7 tabloid @entity37 posted what it said was a video of an undercover reporter meeting with a man identified as @entity42 , who tells the reporter exactly which bowlers would bowl " no balls " and when , then lays out 14 thick stacks of bills on a table			1
the video of the meeting -- which the newspaper said took place wednesday , the day before the match between @entity36 and @entity1 began -- is intercut with clips from the following two days , where the players perform as @entity42 said they would			1
the tabloid also says the alleged ringleader pocketed 150,000 @entity7 pounds ( @entity59 $ 232,800 ) in the scam			2
@entity0 's @entity61 said a 35 - year - old man was arrested late saturday on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud bookmakers			1
a source familiar with the investigation named him as @entity42			1
without identifying the suspect by name , @entity0 police said sunday in a brief statement that the 35 - year - old man was released on bail " until a date in the future			1
" no date for a hearing or further proceedings was given in the statement			2
no players or team officials have been arrested , the @entity77 said sunday			1
but police questioned team captain @entity82 , manager @entity80 and two other players , @entity80 told reporters sunday			1
he did not name the other two players at the news conference , but @entity7 's @entity87 earlier reported that he had said they were bowlers @entity88 and @entity90			2
police refused to confirm to @entity2 who was being questioned			2
team captain @entity82 said @entity36 gave 100 percent throughout a match			1
" we have given our best , " @entity82 said after his team lost to @entity1			1
the team manager refused to comment on the report that @entity5 players intentionally committed three fouls during the match			2
" no allegations are true until they are proved either way , " said @entity80			2
" so that this point in time they are just allegations			0
let 's wait until the case is complete			2
" @entity1 beat @entity36 in the four - day match at @entity110 , which ended sunday afternoon , after the scandal broke			1
@entity36 's president @entity114 ordered an investigation into the scandal , his spokesman said sunday			1
he directed the chairman of the @entity118 to submit a preliminary report " immediately , " @entity120 said , adding that @entity114 asked to be kept informed about any @entity7 investigations as well			0
@entity122 , @entity37 's cricket correspondent , told @entity2 that the tabloid did not " drive these events ... these events were going to happen regardless of whether the @entity37 was involved			0
" but , he said , staffers believed the story was in the public interest			0
" it 's a legitimate story to get to the bottom of something that 's been plaguing our sport , " he said			0
" ... it 's swirled around , and the innuendo 's been there			0
" " people need to know this is going on , " he said , " what they 're watching when they 're paying money to go to sports events ... it 's not always what they believe it to be			0
" however , @entity151 , president of the @entity152 , told @entity2 that while he is " shocked " at the news , " no proof has been given of the involvement of these players in the match - fixing issue " and he has seen no concrete evidence against the cricketers			2
he said if evidence does surface , an investigation will be launched			2
it is the second allegation of corruption directed at the @entity36 cricket team this year			1
the @entity77 's anti-corruption unit was set up in response to allegations against the captains of @entity36 , @entity170 and @entity171 in 2000			1
all three were banned from the game for life			0
@entity37 does not allege that gamblers fixed the results of the match -- only that specific moments in the match were fixed , a practice known as " spot - fixing " rather than " match - fixing			0
" betting on cricket matches is legal in @entity1			0
international and local cricket officials will not be issuing further comment " as this is now subject to a police investigation , " the council said in a statement			1
a @entity61 spokesman told @entity2 the arrest came in response to information provided by the newspaper			0
@entity193 , a cricket expert and the @entity7 editor for @entity197 's @entity196 website , told @entity2 on sunday morning that since a major scandal involving match fixing between @entity170 and @entity171 in 2000 , things appear not to have changed much			0
" what we 're discovering is that corruption has never gone away , " @entity193 said via telephone from @entity0			1
" it 's resurfacing this year -- during the 10th anniversary of the biggest scandal ever to hit cricket			0
" @entity193 said though it remains to be proven , it appears this newest scandal could be on par with the scandal from 10 years ago			0
he added that cricket 's many aspects of play and rules make it susceptible to betting			0
and in a five - day test match , such as the one under way between @entity36 and @entity1 at the @entity222 's cricket ground , there are a lot of possibilities for placing bets that players can manipulate			1
" if you were going to invent a game that you could corrupt -- it would be cricket because you can bet on every aspect of the game , " he continued			0
for example , there are up to 2,700 deliveries per game and if a gambler were to plop down $ 10,000 on the 827th delivery , predicting it correctly , the payoff for that particular bet could be handsome			0
" we believe this is really huge , and could be affecting other areas of cricket , " @entity122 said			0
the @entity37 report was co-authored by @entity245 , a controversial figure in @entity7 journalism who has exposed several previous scams			0
he was responsible for a report in may that revealed duchess of @entity253 @entity252 offered to sell access to her former husband , prince @entity255			0
according to the @entity7 @entity87 , the tabloid 's reporters were able to gain access to the alleged ring by posing as " @entity261 businessmen			2
" @entity2 's @entity267 , @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 and @entity266 contributed to this report .			0
