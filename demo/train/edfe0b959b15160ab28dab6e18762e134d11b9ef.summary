the stated purpose for a meeting of @entity2 in @entity3 on friday was simple : recap the last year and discuss 2014 lessons that will apply in 2016 's presidential election			1
the much - talked about and more interesting purpose , however , was the realization that the pre-campaign that has existed around a likely @entity10 candidacy for the better part of two years is soon coming to an end			1
in the hallway , ballroom and press briefing room of the @entity20 meeting , dozens of top flight democrats , many of whom would make up the roster of a @entity10 campaign , came together to discuss the future of what appears to be a likely run			1
" they are pretty certain , " @entity26 , the president of @entity27 and a possible @entity10 campaign manager in 2016 , said when asked whether session attendees thought @entity10 would run			1
though many of the speakers at the strategy session regularly inserted caveats like " if she runs " or " hypothetically " into conversations with the press , the feeling of nearly everyone in the room was that @entity10 is almost certainly running for president and will likely declare early in 2016			1
" you can derive that by looking at what she has been doing , " said @entity42 , the political director of @entity10 's 1992 campaign and a longtime @entity45 adviser			1
" i think she has been doing everything you would do if you were going to give a serious look to running			0
" @entity42 added that the reason many of the @entity2 were in a @entity3 ballroom on friday was because of those movements by @entity10 , who for the last year has headlined high profile speeches , stumped for @entity2 across the country and written a much ballyhooed book			1
" a lot of people are taking their signals from that , " the @entity62 - based political consultant said			0
" that is one of the reasons this gathering is taking place			0
" but just as certain as the attendees were that @entity10 would be running in the near future , many were equally as certain that her campaign would face challenges and would have free reign of the @entity79 field			1
@entity2 openly worried about @entity10 's campaign finding a message in a changing political landscape and holding on to a @entity79 electorate that was burned by stinging defeats in 2014			1
" if 2016 happens with a 2014 electorate , we are not going to be successful , " said @entity85 , a senior ready for @entity45 adviser and former @entity88 campaign aide			2
" i think the big pitfall for @entity2 is we have not yet figured out a message on the economy that resonates with working class voters			0
... that is , for me , at least the biggest concern out there			0
" strategists from important presidential states like @entity100 and @entity101 also raised concerns about her frontrunner status and their respective states ' tendency to gravitate to fringe , dark horse candidates			2
" @entity100 has a very healthy contrarian spirit			0
it has a very healthy underdog spirit , " said @entity110 , a @entity10 organizer in the @entity100 who joked that he sometimes has dreams ( read : nightmares ) of ( independent @entity113 ) @entity114 toying with a presidential bid			1
" that is what we have to keep our eye on , " he added			0
similar concerns were raised by @entity123 , a longtime @entity10 confidant and aide from @entity101			1
" @entity125 is not a message , it is not something you can run on			0
and in @entity101 , we have a long history of ( frontrunner ) train wrecks , " @entity123 said , noting that despite the @entity10 's long history with @entity101 , many young voters do n't remember that			2
@entity123 , a longtime @entity10 supporter who was with @entity10 when he filed his presidential bid papers in 1991 , added : " as i caution all presidential candidate in @entity101 , taking @entity101 for granted is very dangerous			1
last time i believe @entity45 had an almost 30 - point lead in the polls in our state in the summer and that lead melted like an ice sculpture on the mall in @entity145 in july			1
" @entity10 went on to win the @entity101 primary in 2008 , but by a slim 3 %			2
but @entity10 supporters were also buoyed on friday by that fact that the @entity79 field has been partially frozen for the last year because of their actions			1
prospective candidates like former @entity153 gov. @entity152 and @entity114 have been entertaining bids , and former @entity156 sen. @entity155 declared this week he was launching an exploratory committee			0
but other than that , very few democrats are lining up to take on @entity10 and that was evident in the fact that many @entity10 advisers on friday looked more towards the general election than they did a @entity79 primary			2
" a tough thematic will be , ' a time for change , ' and you can shove a lot under that thematic , " said @entity165 , a @entity10 friend who elevated @entity166 when he signed on as an adviser			2
" if ( the @entity173 ) put up the right ticket -- and they 've been known not to -- but if they put up the right ticket , it could come down to be very , very hotly contested			0
" potential @entity10 campaign staffers also lined the speakers list and hallways of friday 's event			2
@entity180 , the executive director of the @entity181 ; @entity26 , the president of @entity27 ; and @entity183 , a political operative who worked for @entity10 in 2008 , have all been rumored as likely picks for @entity10 's top campaign job			0
@entity180 and @entity183 avoided the press room altogether but sat on a panel in the closed press main ballroom , while @entity26 spoke with reporters but would n't entertain questions about her future with a @entity10 campaign			1
" i 'm not going to talk about any conversations i may or may not be having with a candidate who may or may not be running , " the women 's group leader stated emphatically to reporters			0
not everyone was talking about future jobs , though			0
@entity200 , a friend of @entity10 from his days in @entity201 , was quite gleeful when he thought about not working on another campaign			0
" if she decided to run , and she wants me to do something , i will do what i can , " @entity183 said with a smile			0
" if she wants me to go to the beach and work on my garden , i will go do that			0

supporters met to discuss the past year with *nod* to future @entity45 presidential run
they spoke in hypotheticals , but acknowledged all signs point to @entity10 run
while *hopeful* , many expressed concerns that @entity10 could face in a presidential race
