-- @entity1 promised monday to restore @entity3 foreign policy to a traditional role dating back decades , based on exerting global influence through military and economic power , in a major speech two weeks before he debates president @entity8 on international issues			1
in the address at the @entity11 , @entity1 argued that @entity8 is failing to provide the global leadership needed and expected by the rest of the world , especially key allies such as @entity16			1
@entity1 cited recent protests and violence in @entity20 countries , including an attack on a @entity3 diplomatic compound in @entity23 that killed the @entity3 ambassador and three others , as examples of a worsening security situation that he blamed on @entity8 's policies			1
" it is our responsibility and the responsibility of our president to use @entity3 's great power to shape history â € ” not to lead from behind , leaving our destiny at the mercy of events , " the @entity40 presidential nominee said , after earlier declaring that " unfortunately , this president 's policies have not been equal to our best examples of world leadership and nowhere is this more evident than in the @entity45			1
" poll shows @entity1 tied with @entity8 after debate @entity1 's running mate , rep. @entity48 of @entity49 , offered a similar criticism on monday at a campaign appearance in @entity52			1
" if you look around the world , what we are witnessing is the unraveling of the @entity8 foreign policy , " the conservative @entity59 chairman said , later adding that " if we project weakness abroad , our adversaries are that much more willing to test us , to question our resolve			1
" in response to @entity1 's speech , @entity64 spokesman @entity63 told reporters that the @entity40 candidate 's positions are in most cases similar to @entity8 's policies , while former secretary of state @entity72 accused @entity1 of repeatedly shifting his views			1
" i watched the speech with great interest trying to figure out what governor @entity1 's policies really are , " @entity72 said on a conference call with reporters set up by the @entity8 campaign			1
" this is , i think , the seventh speech he has given on foreign policy over the years , but i think i have come out more confused because he has changed his mind on a number of different issues			2
" in specific policy examples , @entity1 called for the @entity3 to join allies in ensuring that rebels fighting government forces loyal to @entity95 president @entity94 get the military hardware they seek			1
however , he stopped short of calls by some conservatives for @entity99 to directly arm the rebels			0
" in @entity95 , i will work with our partners to identify and organize those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat @entity94 's tanks , helicopters , and fighter jets , " @entity1 said			2
he noted that @entity112 is sending weaponry to @entity94 's forces " because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat for them			0
" " we should be working no less vigorously through our international partners to support the many @entity95 who would deliver that defeat to @entity112 -- rather than sitting on the sidelines , " @entity1 said , making a change from the advance text of the speech that originally called for working " with " international partners			2
" it is essential that we develop influence with those forces in @entity95 that will one day lead a country that sits at the heart of the @entity45			0
" the @entity8 administration has limited direct aid so far to non-lethal support such as communications equipment			0
in addition , the @entity3 is vetting rebels and working with @entity137 and @entity138 to make sure weapons go to preferred groups			2
@entity8 ad : @entity1 is ' reckless ' with foreign policy administration officials have expressed concern about giving weapons to unvetted rebels for fear that the arms could fall into the hands of terrorists			1
@entity1 also criticized @entity8 's overall approach to the @entity153 uprisings in the @entity45 and the @entity16 - @entity155 conflict			1
he argued that last month 's attack on a @entity3 diplomatic compound in @entity158 , @entity23 , that killed @entity3 ambassador @entity159 and three other @entity3 " should not be seen as random			2
" instead , @entity1 said the violence " was likely the work of the same forces affiliated with those that attacked our homeland on september 11th , 2001 , " making a change from excerpts released in advance that described the attackers as likely the same forces from 9 / / 11			0
the recent assault in @entity158 , which took place on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on @entity175 and @entity99 by @entity176 , is under investigation by @entity3 officials , with no formal word yet on exactly who was behind it			0
in the @entity3 , the intelligence community believes it was " a deliberate and organized terrorist assault carried out by extremists " affiliated with or sympathetic to @entity176			0
the @entity8 administration has been criticized for initially blaming the attack on protests over an anti-islam film produced in the @entity3 , then acknowledging it was a terrorist attack			2
@entity1 's @entity191 makeover while @entity1 sought to distinguish himself from @entity8 on foreign policy , specific proposals he cited remained similar to what the administration is doing			1
for example , he called for ending military operations in @entity198 by the end of the 2014 , the same date set by @entity8 and @entity201 , and warned of unspecified steps to stop @entity112 from developing a nuclear weapon			0
@entity8 has said all options remain on the table for preventing an @entity112 nuclear weapon			0
in one distinction , @entity1 said monday that under his leadership , " the @entity3 and our friends and allies will prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons capability , " which differs from @entity8 's pledge to stop @entity112 from getting a nuclear weapon			1
nuclear capability refers to the process of being able to develop a nuclear weapon -- a lower threshold than @entity8 's reference -- and @entity1 's language matched that of his former business colleague , @entity16 prime minister @entity222 , on the issue			1
polls show @entity8 gets higher marks than @entity1 on foreign policy , and the former @entity228 governor hurt his international credentials on a three - nation trip this summer that included a high - profile gaffe in which he questioned @entity233 's preparedness to host the @entity234			1
@entity236 remarks : @entity1 foreign policy speech @entity1 also angered @entity155 leaders with a reference to cultural differences as a reason for differing levels of prosperity between @entity16 and the @entity155 territories			1
in addition , a secretly recorded video of a private campaign event in may showed @entity1 casting doubt on the possibility of reaching a two - state solution in the @entity45 with independent @entity16 and @entity155 states			0
on monday , @entity1 pledged to recommit his administration to seeking the two - state solution and blamed @entity8 for what he called a negotiation process that has " devolved into a series of heated disputes at the @entity257			2
" " in this old conflict , as in every challenge we face in the @entity45 , only a new president will bring the chance to begin anew , " @entity1 said			0
" i know the president hopes for a safer , freer , and a more prosperous @entity45 allied with the @entity3			0
i share this hope , " he said			0
" but hope is not a strategy			0
" undecided : what will sway them ? @entity1 also has faced negative headlines over his quick response to the @entity158 consulate attack			0
soon after word broke of the violence , he fired off a statement that was criticized as inaccurate and premature			0
seeking to remind voters of @entity1 's past gaffes , the @entity8 campaign released a new ad in @entity279 , a battleground in the november 6 election , that characterized the @entity40 challenger as " reckless " and " amateurish " on international affairs			1
the 30 - second spot features news clips of what the commercial calls @entity1 's " gaffe - filled " trip to @entity290 , @entity16 and @entity291			1
" if this is how he handles the world now , " the narrator in the new ad says , " just think what @entity1 might do as president			0
" responding to the ad , a @entity1 campaign spokeswoman said @entity8 was the one who had " weakened " the @entity3 standing in the world			2
@entity8 's mixed week on sunday , @entity1 foreign policy director @entity301 told reporters that the candidate 's foreign policy seeks the traditional @entity3 role in global affairs dating to the end of @entity308 " @entity1 's vision is to restore influence and to support our friends and allies to move the @entity45 onto a path of greater liberty , greater stability , and greater prosperity , " @entity301 said			1
" it 's a restoration of a strategy that served us well for over 70 years			0
" what would you ask @entity323 , @entity48 ? referring to the @entity3 perspective after @entity308 , @entity301 said that " we saw the need to have a military that no one would challenge			2
" he also cited the need to have strategic allies around the world as part of what he called a full spectrum of power " so we do not have to face again the horrors of war			0
" @entity1 and @entity8 will debate foreign policy on october 22 in @entity340 following their second debate in @entity175 on october 16			1
on thursday , vice president @entity323 and @entity1 's running mate , rep. @entity48 of @entity49 , will hold their only debate of the campaign			2
