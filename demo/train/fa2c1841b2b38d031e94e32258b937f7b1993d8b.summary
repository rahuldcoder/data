editor 's note : @entity2 , the @entity4 , @entity5 - based host of a nationally syndicated radio show , hosts a television show designed to help viewers save more , spend less and avoid getting ripped off during these tough economic times			1
the show airs at noon and 4 p.m. et saturdays and sundays on @entity11			0
@entity2 says , " the only smart move is to pay your debt down or pay it off entirely			1
" @entity4 , @entity5 ( @entity15 ) -- i 've been getting many calls from listeners who are outraged or perplexed by the actions of their credit card issuer			1
the issuing banks are raising interest rates by 20 percent or more -- even if the individual has good credit , has never been late on a payment or has n't even had any change in their credit standing			1
this is happening across all income levels			0
it 's even affecting successful business owners and moderate to wealthy individuals			0
@entity33 recently spotlighted one small business owner who had a card that went from nearly 8 percent to 26 percent , even though nothing changed with his finances or payment history			2
@entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 are among the big issuers arbitrarily jacking up rates in the face of what they often cite as a " continually changing business environment			0
" in fact , the @entity48 reports 37 percent of banks have increased their interest rates			1
the reality is that the banks are fearful of the high rate of credit card default , and they know they 've got you if you 're among the 70 percent of @entity57 who carry a month - to - month balance			1
the good news here is that there are new rules coming that will stop the banks from retroactively raising the rate on existing balances you already carry			1
the banks will still , however , be able to raise the rates if you stop paying as well as on all future purchases			1
but what stinks is that these rules wo n't go into effect until july 2010			2
that gives the banks plenty of time to lobby members of @entity79 and get this pending legislation overturned			2
for right now , the problem with banks jacking up the rates is that they 're making it tougher for someone who might have been able to pay at 5 percent but could never pay at 30 percent , for example			1
so they 're setting you up for failure , and they 're shooting themselves in the foot at the same time			0
the only smart move is to pay your debt down or pay it off entirely			2
and do n't assume you 're a sitting duck if your credit standing is decent			0
you can always shop around for a card that has a lower rate			2
try looking at web sites such as @entity101 or @entity102 to find the best rates			0
i also have a special warning for you if you 're buried in debt and thinking about using one of those debt - negotiation firms that advertise all over the @entity110 and late - night tv			0
do not believe these people about their ability to negotiate with your credit card company and reduce your outstanding balance by 50 percent or more			1
these con artists get you to pay them money as a retainer and then tell you to stop making all payments while they negotiate on your behalf			2
but they 're rip - off artists through and through			0
many banks wo n't even take a phone call from these people anymore because they 're on to their game			2
that leaves you scammed out of your retainer fee while your bills continue to pile up			0
there is a better way to address your debt			0
try calling your credit card company and telling them you 're in over your head			1
you may get blown off , or they may work with you			0
if you do get the cold shoulder , go to @entity136 -- the @entity137 -- and find a local affiliate who can help you come up with a debt - conquering plan for free or very low cost			0
you did n't get into credit card debt overnight , and you wo n't get out of it overnight ; the recovery is going to be a slow step - by - step process .			1
