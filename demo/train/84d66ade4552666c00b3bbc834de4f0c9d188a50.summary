@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity6 loyalists who had been holding journalists in @entity0 's @entity8 for five days " essentially just capitulated " upon realizing that most of the rest of the city had fallen to rebels , @entity2 's @entity3 said after his release wednesday			1
their release ended what some were beginning to fear was a hostage situation for the three dozen journalists who had been kept inside the blacked - out hotel as fighters loyal to the @entity19 fought their way into the @entity1 capital			0
chance , a senior international correspondent for @entity2 , said " the reality slowly dawned " on their guards that @entity6 's government was collapsing			1
" they really believed that @entity6 was coming back , that he was beating the rebels , " chance said after his release			1
" that 's what the government line has been on this all along			0
" but as the rebels advanced through the city and overran @entity6 's @entity35 on tuesday , " it became more and more obvious that there was nothing really outside of the hotel that was in @entity6 's control			1
" wednesday , the guards handed over their weapons and told the journalists , " we 're going to let you go , " chance said			1
the release was coordinated through the @entity46 , which , along with the @entity47 , provided cars to drive them out			1
@entity2 producer @entity49 said the men who held them " really did not know what the scenes on the streets of @entity0 were like			1
" shortly before the guards gave up , she said , one guard asked a companion , " you were out there -- tell me , what 's really going on ? is it what they are telling us ? " chance called the experience a " nightmare , " saying the journalists wept with relief after their release			1
the " die - hard @entity6 loyalists " who held them thought they were @entity72 spies , he said			2
on tuesday , one shouted " i suppose you 're happy now that they 're killing @entity1 , " he said			0
the reporters had been bandying about " all kinds of paranoid scenarios " about what would be done to them , like being used as human shields or executed " by some lunatic hard - liner , " chance said			2
but in the end , all were released unharmed			0
" everybody 's been hugging each other , " chance said			0
" people who have been living cheek - to - jowl for the past five days , sleeping in the corridors , wondering whether we were going to make it -- it 's all very emotional , " he said			0
@entity95 : are you in @entity1 ? share photos chance had described on @entity99 the process of going free , piling into a car with other journalists , and driving away from the hotel that had become a virtual prison			2
" i can see the @entity19 rebels			0
we are nearly there ! " he wrote , followed a moment later by : " @entity8 crisis ends			2
all journalists are out ! "			0
