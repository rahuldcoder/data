@entity0 -- if you are parked in front of your tv to watch the @entity5 , you only saw a fraction of what happened at the annual music awards show sunday			1
in fact , 70 of the 81 trophies were handed out in a pre-telecast ceremony in the @entity12 , next to the @entity13 where the last 11 @entity5 were presented between a record 20 star - studded performances			1
plenty of action takes place backstage where the winners go to talk after they leave the stage , as well			2
there were hints backstage that the @entity23 , which claimed the best country album @entity5 , may be veering into other music genres			1
" i love great music of all different kinds , " @entity23 said			1
" we 're just getting started			0
one project ahead is an acoustic album , @entity30 said			2
" we really control all of our destiny now and all of our rights to everything we do now , so we can really experiment , " he said			0
he especially enjoyed the @entity5 performances of @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 , @entity30 said			1
@entity30 used the @entity5 weekend to develop relationships with other artists			1
" my rolodex got strong this weekend , " he said			0
after @entity46 won her sixth @entity5 , the latest for best country solo performance , she made it clear backstage that she 's sticking to country music and would never cross over into pop music			1
" i love that world , " @entity51 said			0
" i love the people in it			0
i love making country music that anybody can get into			1
if it ever crosses over , then it does it on its on			0
i do n't think i can see myself making a pop album			1
" we learned backstage why @entity62 teased the dream about the " @entity64 " he was wearing when they accepted their @entity5 for best rap / sung collabotation			1
" i would like to thank the swap meet for his hat , " @entity62 said in his acceptance			0
" he was just digging on me , " @entity71 explained backstage			2
" yeah , we do that			0
" the trigger for the kiddng was that @entity62 's wife , @entity75 , had just said she wanted the hat			2
and in fact , he bought the cap at a swap meet in @entity80 , @entity81 , he said			0
@entity71 also revealed he would fly to @entity82 soon to work on an album with @entity85 , who shared the collaboration grammy with him			2
" hopefully we can get another @entity5 together , " he said			1
the televised presentations target pop , country , urban , rock , and rap categories , leaving the jazz , gospel , classical , @entity94 and other categories to the pre-show			1
the @entity97 was far from full , because many of the 754 individual nominees and their teams were on the red carpet or still getting ready for the big show while the pre-show was under way			2
but if you were there for the pre-show -- or watched it streamed online -- you would have heard @entity38 , @entity107 , @entity62 , @entity85 , @entity108 , @entity75 and @entity109 win @entity5			1
you still would not have seen them , however , because those stars were not present to accept			0
you would have seen @entity112 making an effort to appear excited and surprised as she accepted a @entity5 for best song written for visual media			1
she won it because she was a co-writer of " @entity117 , " a song made for " @entity120 " film			0
" this is unbelievable ! " @entity112 exclaimed			0
it was her sixth grammy in her young career			0
@entity125 ' @entity124 also took the pre-telecast stage to accept the @entity5 for best historical album			1
he co-produced " @entity131 , " a resurrection of an abandoned @entity125 album project from 45 years ago			2
he hinted that the @entity125 have " a lot of stuff in the can that has n't been heard " and that the group would " try to get an album together " this year			2
@entity124 , 70 , appeared frail , requiring two men to walk on each side backstage			0
@entity139 , another major star from the past , was there to accept a @entity5			1
@entity141 called it a " big upset " when she beat first lady @entity142 , former president @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 in the best spoken word category			0
" i keep thinking there must be a punchline here , " @entity141 joked			0
" an ex-president and the first lady and three lesbians walk into a bar			0
" @entity141 won for narrating " @entity154 : my autobiography			0
" it was just her second grammy after nine nominations in eight different categories			0
" i made a choice to be a songwriter and not be part of the circus all the time			0
i do n't do popular music because that 's not what i 'm good at , " @entity141 said backstage			1
@entity166 was there to get her 10th @entity5 , the latest for best @entity169 album given for " @entity170			1
" " i did n't expect this , " @entity166 said			0
" jazz legend @entity173 took home his 20th @entity5 out of 36 nominated			2
the latest for best jazz instrumental album , given to him for " @entity176			0
" @entity177 , the bass - playing jazz singer whose best new artist win upset @entity181 fans two years ago , was present to win two more grammys in the pre-telecast			1
@entity184 , 28 , won for best instrumental arrangement accompanying vocalists and for best jazz vocal album for " @entity188			0
" @entity107 , whom @entity184 also beat two years ago for best new artist , may now wish he had been there because the rapper was awarded his first @entity5 after 13 nominations			1
then again , he also lost twice sunday when @entity62 and @entity85 beat him in the best rap song and best rap performance categories			2
@entity109 was a no - show to pick up his grammy for best traditional pop vocal album			2
it was awarded for his " @entity200 " album			0
while there are plenty of household names announced in the pre-show , it is also the chance for the @entity207 to honor people who perform important jobs for the music industry			2
for example , @entity211 won a @entity5 for writing the best album notes			1
he composed the notes for an album of @entity217 music , " @entity218 : the @entity219			1
" @entity220 , the art director for " @entity221 : the @entity223 , " won a @entity5 for producing the best boxed or special limited edition package			1
while this may seem to be the most unglamorous of all @entity5 , @entity220 said the category was important for " recognizing the role packaging design plays in these days of downloaded music			1
