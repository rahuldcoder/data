-- president @entity3 has written yet another letter to @entity6 's @entity5 and , by all accounts , his missives remain unrequited			1
it is not a pretty sight -- the commander - in - chief of the planet 's mightiest army , the leader of the world 's largest economy -- sitting down at his desk , chin in hand , trying to come up with just the right words to persuade the @entity20 to make nice with @entity21 , time and again , even after his letters prompt a combination of silence and scorn			0
it is good that @entity6 and the @entity21 are talking			1
but this is another matter altogether			0
a letter is not needed to maintain communications			0
the two countries are already engaged in high - level negotiations , with a make - or - break deadline fast approaching on a nuclear deal			1
the sad fact is that @entity3 's words seem to provoke exactly the opposite of their intended reaction from @entity20 , the man who will ultimately decide if there is a nuclear deal			1
@entity20 has been crystal clear in expressing barely restrained contempt for @entity3 and his rhetorical advances			2
@entity3 is not a very good negotiator , at least when it comes to @entity6			1
@entity3 has many strengths , but bargaining does not appear to be one of them			2
the fact has been evident in @entity52 , where he scored a few major legislative victories , but has mostly seen his agenda blocked			0
the blockers are @entity56 and they surely bear much of the blame , but , as many have pointed out , other presidents have proven more effective at negotiating with the opposition			0
after watching @entity3 's first press conference after the midterm election , @entity62 's @entity61 wondered if @entity3 even knows how to negotiate			2
that is a scary question to ponder when the @entity21 is on the verge of cutting a deal aimed at preventing @entity6 from developing nuclear weapons , when @entity71 nuclear inspectors say @entity6 is refusing to answer questions about " possible military dimensions " of its nuclear program , and as the @entity21 and the so - called @entity76 negotiating with @entity6 steadily reduce their demands on @entity6 's nuclear enrichment			1
as @entity3 has said repeatedly , a bad deal with @entity6 is worse than no deal at all			1
the question is whether @entity3 's negotiating missteps are just that , missteps that can be corrected by crafty negotiators , or signs that he is so eager for a deal that he will lower the bar on what he considers as an acceptable agreement			1
@entity3 has focused on repairing relations with @entity6 since he was a presidential candidate , making all the statements and gestures that should have warmed @entity94 to a new future in an @entity3 presidency , if @entity6 had had any interest at all			1
as a candidate he called for direct talks , and in his first inaugural speech he famously declared " we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist			0
" then , just after taking office , he went to @entity107 and gave his conciliatory speech to the " muslim world , " vowing a new era in ties			0
@entity20 's reaction should have been enough to have @entity3 cross out the @entity5 from his list of pen pals			1
" beautiful speeches , " @entity20 declared , " can not change the fact that @entity116 ... hate @entity21 from the bottom of their hearts			0
" a few months later , when @entity6 took to the streets and were brutally suppressed , @entity3 , who had just issued another conciliatory gesture , initially refrained from airing criticism			1
the @entity20 later excoriated the @entity21 president , blaming the pro-democracy protests on @entity21 and " zionist " plots , not on discontent with the regime and its version of theocratic democracy			0
and yet , the missives from @entity3 kept coming			2
and still they traveled in just one direction			0
maybe the president should have sent a self - addressed stamped envelope			0
at least then the disdain might have remained private			0
the problem is worse than an epistolary cold shoulder			0
every letter from @entity3 seems to contain a concession that goes unreciprocated			2
@entity6 came to the table as the result of stern economic sanctions steadily enforced by @entity3 , and he deserves full credit for that			1
but it 's not clear whether his personal interventions have helped the cause			0
amid reports that the @entity151 is already proposing to allow @entity6 a level of nuclear enrichment that would have been unthinkable in the recent past , the most recent letter crossed another line , reportedly suggesting a linkage between a nuclear agreement and cooperation between @entity52 and @entity94 in fighting the @entity159 , also known as @entity160			1
@entity3 denied there is a link , without commenting on the letter			2
when thinking about @entity160 , @entity165 and @entity6 , we should remember that even though @entity160 is viewed as a threat by both @entity52 and @entity94 , @entity6 's goal is to fortify @entity165 dictator @entity168			1
the @entity21 and @entity6 share their enmity with @entity160 , but their larger goals are in conflict			2
and that 's just on @entity165			0
@entity6 is viewed as a threat by @entity21 's allies in the @entity177 world , not to mention by @entity178 , which it continues to goad and threaten			2
in apparent response to last month 's letter , @entity20 's website carried an article saying @entity6 does not need @entity21 help fighting @entity160			1
the @entity21 has not done very well in the fight , it said , whereas @entity187 , with @entity6 help , is scoring victories against @entity160			2
the timing of @entity3 's new letter is disconcerting , to say the least			1
the recent drop in oil prices has put @entity6 in a serious bind			0
this could be a moment of strength for @entity21 and @entity198 negotiators , a moment to show just how much @entity6 has to lose by insisting on maintaining significant portions of a nuclear program that @entity21 , @entity198 and many @entity177 countries believe was developed for the purpose of building nuclear weapons			2
@entity52 already gave up the objective of seeing the nuclear program dismantled			0
the question now is how many months away from a bomb @entity6 would agree to stand in exchange for a lifting of sanctions			0
@entity6 has played an expert game			1
@entity20 's ability to nix any deal he does not like looms constantly over the talks , strengthening @entity6 's hand			1
the @entity21 leader , on the other hand , could use some help .			0
