while their countrymen prepared to attend to the @entity4 ideals of " citius , altius , fortius " -- faster , higher , stronger -- two @entity1 thrillseekers traveled to @entity6 to put at least one of those to the ultimate test by scaling the as yet unfinished @entity9 in the city 's financial district			1
the climbers were the same men who made headlines last year when they scaled the @entity14 at @entity15 , @entity16 -- and later apologized when they were accused of disrespecting the ancient monuments			1
they recorded their exploits in @entity9 with forehead - mounted cameras , and the resulting footage , which shows their adrenaline - fueled journey from break - in to summit , is breathtaking			1
the video , uploaded to video sharing site @entity26 , shows two masked men wearing hoodies talking urgently in @entity1 as they scope out the boarded - up construction site , before slipping in			1
under the cover of darkness , they make their way up to the roof of the skyscraper			0
the climbers , @entity37 and @entity38 , are n't new to this type of extreme freeclimbing			0
their blogs show images of climbers clambering over sites including buildings , mines and dams across @entity48 , the @entity49 and @entity50 and @entity51			1
@entity53 's blog shows a climber with a camera atop one of the pyramids outside @entity58			0
@entity38 told @entity59 that he was " not scared " when climbing this kind of structure , although it was an " usual situation " for him to undertake this kind of climb			0
peering over the side , the upper floors of the distinctive , 492m @entity65 and the neighboring @entity67 ( 421m ) can be seen in the video , peeking through low lying clouds			0
from their vantage point on top of the unfinished building , @entity38 and @entity53 look down on the skyscrapers -- the height of the new construction dwarfing its neighbors , which had previously dominated @entity9 's skyline			1
undaunted , the pair then swing out onto a crane and continue clambering skywards			0
cutting back and forth between the daredevils as they ascend the crane , the wide angled cameras show the yawning chasm beneath their sneakered feet -- neither man appears to wear any safety gear			0
upon reaching the very top of the crane , one examines his hands , grimy from the long climb , and the pair high - five each other before taking the ultimate @entity95 profile pic - one unlikely to ever be replicated			2
the 2073 ft ( 632 m ) @entity9 , when completed , will be the second - tallest in the world , after the @entity99 in @entity100			2
when the crane jib climbed by the men is factored in , the total height scaled is estimated to be 650m			2
@entity37 's blog says that the pair waited until the @entity107 holidays , when construction teams had left the site .			2
