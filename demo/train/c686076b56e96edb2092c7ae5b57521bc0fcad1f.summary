a @entity1 couple has reached out to the @entity3 to help save their twin 3 - year - olds			2
@entity6 and @entity7 both require a liver transplant to survive			1
the problem is that their father , @entity10 , can donate to only one of the pair			1
@entity10 and his wife , @entity14 , have taken their search for a second donor to social media , establishing a @entity20 page , @entity21 for our @entity22 , which has garnered more than 5,000 likes as of monday afternoon			2
the @entity26 , @entity27 , couple also has a blog , one more potato in the @entity30 , about their lives with nine children , four of whom are adopted			2
" we need people to come forward , people who are willing to be assessed to be live liver donors , " @entity34 told @entity35 on sunday			1
" things could turn around very quickly on us , and their condition could get worse			2
" the twins were adopted from @entity43 in november 2012 , when they were 18 months old			1
the pair are afflicted with @entity46 syndrome , a genetic disorder that causes liver damage because of bile duct abnormalities , according to the @entity51 's @entity50			1
among other issues , the ailment causes the twins to itch severely -- enough that they scratch while they sleep , creating sores			1
the @entity57 ask interested parties to contact the following : @entity59 ( @entity60 ) living @entity61 416 - 340 - 4800 ext. 6581 and specify that you are willing to be assessed to donate to either @entity63 or @entity64 ( date of birth may 14 , 2011 )			2
you can also go to this website or print the @entity68 and fax it to 416 - 340 - 4317			0
" when we went to @entity43 , before we went , we knew that they were very ill , and we knew it was liver - related , " @entity10 told @entity35			1
" we said , ' all right , we 're committed , and we 're going to move forward with the hope that everything is going to be ok			0
' " the @entity57 have been updating their @entity20 page since establishing it december 26			0
what 's needed , they say , is someone who meets the following qualifications : 1 ) be older than 18 and younger than 60			0
2 ) be in good overall health and physical condition			0
3 ) have a compatible blood type : a or @entity82 ( rhesus factor positive or negative does not matter )			0
4 ) have a @entity84 of less than 35 to be worked up for consideration and no greater than 32 at the time of surgery ( transplant )			0
livers do regrow , but a donor would have to be in a hospital for several days and take another few weeks to recover			0
in the meantime , the @entity57 and the girls ' doctors are monitoring the situation			1
if things take a turn for the worse , the twins ' doctor dr. @entity96 told @entity35 , the girl who will receive @entity10 's liver will be chosen based on immediate need			1
" i think we will make the decision based on facts and keep it as dispassionate as possible , " she said			0
" we feel comfortable making this decision			0

the twins need liver transplants , or they *'ll* die
the girls are afflicted with @entity46 syndrome ; their father can help just one
