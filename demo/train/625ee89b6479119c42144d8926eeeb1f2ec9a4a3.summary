-- as a politically active @entity2 invested in this year 's election , i was surprised by my own response to the first presidential debate : i was bored			1
but not for all the reasons the pundits are talking about			2
to be sure , president @entity9 's lackluster performance and @entity11 's free rein over the moderator led us into the weeds of policy without a compass			1
but that was n't the only reason the candidates did n't speak to me			0
the debate was supposed to be about domestic issues , but focused exclusively on economic policies and health care plans			1
as a @entity2 , or a member of the generation born in the 1980s and 1990s , i care deeply about the economy and health care			1
my generation faces crushing educational debt of $ 904 billion in 2012 , up from $ 241 billion a decade ago ; many of us do n't have health insurance ; and we face an unemployment rate that , at 12 % , is 50 % above the national average			1
but we also want our leaders to connect the dots			0
opinion : a plea to millennials -- get out the vote among my own @entity2 friends , we do n't debate economic reform without addressing the immigrant labor force			1
we never discuss health care without also grappling with women 's rights			1
and yet , the candidates wednesday night managed to debate fine points of policy while missing the big picture			1
we ca n't build a moral economy or health care system without considering the major social challenges of our time : civil liberties , immigration , women 's rights , domestic extremism and climate change			1
none of these issues was even mentioned in the debate			1
the failure to speak clearly and consistently to our generation 's concerns about the world we will inherit has consequences in this election			1
in the 2008 election , @entity68 made up 17 % of the electorate and voted 66 % for @entity9 , compared with 32 % for @entity71			0
we were responsible for @entity9 's decisive seven - point victory , accounting for 80 % of @entity9 's national popular vote margin over @entity71			1
our generation now makes up 24 % of the electorate and could make up the deciding vote again , but only if we make it to the polls			1
we are not nearly as engaged this election season as the last time around			0
we lag behind older voters in interest in the election and intention to vote			0
only 18 percent of us under 30 are following this election closely , down from 35 % four years ago			0
just 63 % of those of us registered say we will vote , down from 72 % last time around			0
while these numbers hold for both young @entity89 and @entity90 , a dip in voter turnout is most consequential for @entity9 , who leads among our peers			0
why are we losing interest ? let 's put this election in context			2
for the majority of us who voted for @entity9 , electing the president in 2008 felt like changing the course of history			0
opinion : who are millennials ? our generation came of age in the shadow of catastrophe -- the aftermath of 9/11 , the genocide in @entity114 , @entity115 and its aftermath , the wars in @entity110 and in @entity111 , and a faltering economy			2
we had hoped that the historic election of our first @entity120 - @entity119 president , a candidate who embodied our diversity in being and breath , would initiate a new era that broke from @entity125 - era politics			0
instead , the president inherited a punishing economic recession and @entity90 obstructionism that made even modest reforms challenging			0
even worse , his administration continued some @entity125 - era national security policies he promised to end , from indefinite detention at home to drone warfare abroad			0
as a result , @entity68 i know have become disillusioned about national political change , turned to local politics and community engagement instead and focused on getting through tough times			2
still , many , like me , are not giving up			0
this election year , i 've sobered up about the meaning of hope			0
@entity145 requires action beyond casting a vote ; it requires holding our elected leaders to task			0
the president repealed @entity150 , came out for marriage equality and created a program that allows undocumented youth to live and work legally in the @entity119 i believe that @entity68 can be critical of the political process and still have faith that incremental change is possible if we organize before and after @entity158			2
opinion : why this election is so personal of course , it 's difficult to organize if our candidates are not even discussing our concerns			2
no matter who we support , let 's ask that our candidates debate all the issues that determine the future of our nation			1
no one has more at stake than the generation who will inherit it			2
