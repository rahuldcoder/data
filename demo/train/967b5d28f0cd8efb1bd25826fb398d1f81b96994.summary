-- sure , your third - generation @entity1 is great and all , but after tuesday 's announcement of @entity5 's @entity4 and @entity1 4 , perhaps you wish you could trade - up			1
or maybe you feel like you do n't have a choice if you want it to retain any value			0
well , you 're in luck if you want to trade it in			0
@entity11 is not the only option anymore â € ” there are an increasing number of sites that let you sell your " old " device and put that cash toward a new one			1
a lot of these sites work the same way : enter the information about your device , including its condition and original packaging			1
the site gives you an estimate of how much your gadget is worth , and if you accept , they send you a pre-paid shipping label ( sometimes a box , too )			0
the main differences between the various sites are how much the prices vary			2
some of these sites also ask for more details than others , which can benefit you if you have a flawless device			1
gazelle you might know of @entity39 from its television commercials			1
the company experienced a deluge of customers this past february who were trying to sell their ipad 2s after @entity5 's announcement of a mysterious event on march 7 ( which turned out to be the unveiling of the third generation @entity1 )			1
for the third generation @entity1 with @entity53 and @entity54 , the site offers $ 260 if it 's in good condition ( visible signs of use ) , $ 300 for flawless condition ( looks like it 's never been used ) , and $ 90 if it 's broken ( does not turn on or has serious damage )			1
@entity62 with this site , you type in the device you have and then select any damages , including : damaged or defective screen , bad battery , or does not power on			2
for the @entity69 32gb @entity53 , the site would pay $ 294 â € ” so long as the device powers on			0
and do n't count your device out if it 's damaged â € ” for a @entity5 new ipad @entity72 with a damaged or defective screen you can still get $ 172			1
@entity75 this site offers $ 507 for the @entity1 with @entity53 and @entity54 with only a few scratches and in good working condition , in the color white with no engraving , and if you include the power cord			2
what 's useful about @entity75 is it gives you more options to tell them about the amazing ( or maybe not so amazing ) condition you 've kept your device in , which can earn you more cash			0
