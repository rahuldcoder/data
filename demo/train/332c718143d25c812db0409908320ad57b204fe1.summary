-- the nation 's news media are sure to cover the one - year anniversary of the mass shooting at @entity5 extensively on saturday			1
but for the most part , these news organizations say they will acquiesce to the requests of local community members and not report from @entity10 , @entity11 , the town where @entity12 killed 20 first - graders and six adults at the now - demolished school on december 14 , 2012			1
the massacre was the second - deadliest school shooting in @entity19 history			2
@entity0 said in a statement that while it " plans to cover the one - year anniversary across our networks and platforms , we are respecting the wishes of the families , and we are not reporting from @entity10 on saturday			1
" similarly , an @entity28 spokeswoman said in an e-mail that " @entity30 is respecting the town 's wishes and our broadcasts have no plans to be in @entity10 for the anniversary			1
" other television networks issued almost identical statements when contacted			0
such decisions are exceptionally rare for news organizations and underline the tension between the necessity of covering tragedy and respecting the people who are being covered -- in this case , parents with dead children and their neighbors			1
what really makes schools safer ? in the run - up to the anniversary , @entity10 officials said they hoped the press would not descend on the small town , stirring debate about what reporters should and should not do			1
" we are wishing fervently that those many persons who wish us well , and the media , will allow us this time to be alone and quiet with time for personal and communal reflection , " said @entity58 , the town 's first selectman , a role similar to that of mayor			0
but the job of journalists is , at times , to document such reflection and share it with the public			0
the @entity71 said it will provide " respectful coverage " of the anniversary saturday , " as we have since @entity74 of @entity10 's tragedy			1
" " as a news cooperative , owned by some 1,400 daily newspapers across the country , and as a provider of news and information to hundreds of other customers worldwide , @entity71 also recognizes its obligation to report on how @entity10 is coming together to mourn and heal , " a spokesman for the news organization said			1
many news organizations visited @entity10 ahead of the anniversary to conduct reporting to televise and publish on saturday			1
@entity88 was among those , and the network signaled this week it would not have a camera crew in the town saturday			2
" we are sensitive to the families ' concerns and will cover the anniversary in the least intrusive way possible , " said @entity93 , director of special events for @entity88			0
@entity10 residents plead for privacy newspaper and online journalists are generally able to maintain low profiles on sensitive assignments , with notebooks and cell phones the only necessary tools of the trade			0
television journalists , on the other hand , are more often accompanied by intrusive cameras , microphones and trucks			0
like the national networks , local television stations in @entity11 have said they will avoid using @entity10 as a backdrop for live shots			2
@entity119 , an editor of the book " @entity121 : principles for the @entity127 , " wrote in a @entity123 blog post friday that it " would be wrong to leave the anniversary itself unnoticed , " but that such coverage can and should be done with sensitivity			0
" we live in a media world of excess			0
with self - discipline , restraint and a sense of service to our audience -- rather than to our ratings or web metrics -- journalists should be able to provide meaningful stories a year after @entity10 , " @entity119 wrote			2
" and possibly such efforts can set the tone for future tragedies			0
" @entity19 school violence fast facts			0
