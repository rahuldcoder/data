-- chief warrant officer @entity1 survived the 2009 massacre at @entity3 , @entity4 , with two bullet wounds to his back			1
the slugs left him with nerve damage that numbs his left arm and leg and sends streaking pains " shooting up and down my back			2
" and it 's left invisible scars as well -- post-traumatic stress that has hurt his ability to perform his duties as a computer specialist and left him unable to feel safe in his own country			1

i really do , " said @entity1 , who served in @entity21 four times and in @entity23 once			2

prosecutors will start presenting their case against maj. @entity33 on tuesday in a court - martial at @entity3 , outside @entity35 , @entity4			1
@entity1 , who escaped the gunfire only to go back into the processing center in an attempt to tackle @entity33 , will be one of the witnesses against him			1
" i had escaped without being wounded , " @entity1 said			2
" i got about fifty meters ( yards ) in the parking lot , and then i said , ' i ca n't let him get away with this			2

i just knew that i could n't let him get away			0
" @entity33 , an @entity25 psychiatrist , is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted murder			2
prosecutors hope to show that the devout @entity50 had undergone a " progressive radicalization , " giving presentations in defense of suicide bombing and about soldiers conflicted between military service and their religion when such conflicts result in crime			0

meanwhile , @entity1 copes with his pain and stress by taking near - scalding baths and running , including a roughly 70 - mile jaunt from @entity3 to @entity84			1
