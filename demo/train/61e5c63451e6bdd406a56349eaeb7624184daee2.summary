@entity0 -- the cause of a deadly @entity3 subway crash last month remains a mystery , with one problem identified by investigators persisting even after engineers replaced a key part that was believed to be faulty , a top @entity3 official said tuesday investigators are shown at the crash scene in @entity0			1
nine people were killed in the june 22 accident			1
at a congressional hearing , @entity15 said @entity3 replaced a device that was " fluttering , " signaling the presence of a train one moment and not the next			1
" you 'd think that that would remedy the issue , that ... we would have solved the problem , " said @entity15 , chairman of @entity3 's board of directors			1
" in fact , the new device ... continued the same fluttering as the former device			0
" " we 're left with a very compelling mystery as to what is going on here , " he said			0
the @entity35 , which is leading the investigation , acknowledged that @entity3 's system of detecting trains continues to have unexplained , intermittent failures			1
" sometimes it 's working ; sometimes it 's not , even with those changes , " @entity35 member @entity40 told a @entity42 committee			1
" we 've walked back the cable to see if there might be some cabling issues			0
there 's a lot of challenges here and we 're changing out some components and trying to identify what the problem is , " she said			2
@entity3 has said it will operate the subway trains on manual control until officials have identified and fixed the problem with the automatic train system			2
nine people were killed and scores were injured during the june 22 crash just north of the @entity64 's @entity63 station			1
at tuesday 's hearing , a passenger on one of the trains gave a dramatic description of the accident			2
@entity71 of @entity72 , @entity73 , said he had just put down his newspaper and closed his eyes to relax when he heard a screeching sound , someone yelling and " one of the loudest bangs i 've ever heard in my life			0
" @entity71 said in the impact , he hit the seat in front of him			0
when @entity71 peered into the forward-most car , he saw extensive damage			0
the floor of the car had collapsed " accordion - like , " he said			1
" we could hear the people at this point in the first car , " he said			2
" and it was pretty chaotic			0
they were screaming ; they were upset , " he said			0
but the collision had jammed the doors between the cars , making it impossible to reach victims in the front car			2
it was n't until he got off the train that he realized the first car was thrust into the air , he said			0
@entity104 , the @entity0 's @entity106 delegate , chided the @entity35 for making prohibitively costly safety recommendations while ignoring cheaper , common sense solutions , such as putting the newer , more robust rail cars at the front and back of trains			1
" over and over again , you said , ' do the impossible , ' " @entity112 , a @entity113 , said , referring to @entity35 recommendations that @entity3 replace older cars with sturdier new ones			1
" why did n't the transportation board at least recommend this rather low - tech , low - cost step ? " @entity40 said the @entity35 's role is to push for safety improvements			1
" we do make recommendations , ms. @entity104 , and we do n't have to pay for them , so we recognize that frustration , " she said			2
" but our charge is not to [ consider costs ]			0
our charge is to recommend what we think is in the best interest of the safety community			0
we are the conscience and the compass of the transportation industry , and they [ transportation providers and regulators ] get to decide if and how they implement it , " @entity40 said .			0
