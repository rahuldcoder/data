@entity0 -- an international custody battle over a 70 million - year - old dinosaur skeleton ended monday with the fossil being repatriated to @entity5 after having been illegally smuggled , handed from owner to owner multiple times and sold at auction			1
the " nearly complete " skeleton of a @entity11 -- also known as a @entity13 bataar -- was turned over to representatives of the government of @entity5 by the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) and @entity19 attorney 's office in a @entity0 repatriation ceremony			1
" this is one of the most important repatriations of fossils in recent years , " said ice director @entity21			2
" we can not allow the greed of a few looters and schemers to trump the cultural interests of an entire nation			0
" " after a year - long legal adventure and the worldwide publicity , the @entity34 indeed became a hero dinosaur at home in @entity5 , " said @entity31 from the office of the president of @entity5			1
" ( we ) are very grateful to all the organizations and individuals who helped make it happen			0
" under @entity5 law , dinosaur fossils are property of the @entity5 government and exporting them from the country is a criminal offense			1
according to court documents , the dinosaur skeleton was imported into the @entity19 from @entity51 on march 27 , 2010			1
largely inaccurate import documents listed the bones ' country of origin as @entity51 , while several paleontologists say @entity58 bataars have been recovered only in @entity5			2
the skeleton , standing 8 feet tall and stretching 24 feet in length , also was incorrectly described as various fossil reptile bones and other broken bones			0
@entity19 authorities gained possession of the skeleton after a self - described " commercial paleontologist " from @entity66 pleaded guilty in december 2012 to smuggling and other charges			2
as part of his plea agrement the defendant , @entity69 , agreed to forfeit the bataar skeleton , as well four other dinosaur skeletons			0

the auction house disregarded the restraining order , and it was sold to an undisclosed buyer in @entity0 for $ 1.05 million on may 20 , 2012 , contingent upon the outcome of any court proceedings instituted on behalf of the @entity5 government			1
in the following months , investigations by @entity19 authorities and paleontologists determined the skeleton was from the western @entity117 in @entity5 , uncovered between 1995 and 2005			1
the @entity19 attorney 's office for the @entity120 filed action to seek forfeit of the bones , which were eventually seized by @entity16 's @entity124			1
@entity126 @entity19 attorney @entity125 said monday , " cultural artifacts are part of the fabric of a country 's history , and it is immensely satisfying to play a role in their return			1
