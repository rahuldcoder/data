@entity0 , @entity1 -- after agreeing in principle to hold talks on reopening their joint industrial complex , @entity3 and @entity1 are haggling over the date and time of the potential meetings			1
the proposed talks are the clearest sign yet of an improvement in the severely strained relations between the two sides after @entity14 set off months of unsettling tensions with a long - range rocket launch in december followed by an underground nuclear test in february			1
the @entity3 broke the impasse between the two sides over the @entity19 -- a major symbol of cooperation between the two countries where @entity23 halted activity in april -- by issuing a proposal on thursday for talks			1
it said that " the venue of the talks and the date for their opening can be set to the convenience of the south side			0
" @entity1 reacted quickly and positively to the offer , noting that it had been " continuously " seeking talks on @entity19 since the @entity3 shut it down			1
the @entity1 's unification minister , @entity37 , suggested the two sides hold ministerial - level talks in @entity0 on wednesday			1
on friday morning , the @entity3 expressed appreciation for the @entity1 's response			1
it said it thinks that " working contact " between the two governments is necessary before ministerial talks , proposing that the lower - level meeting take place in @entity19 on sunday			1
it also said it would meet a request from the @entity1 to reopen on friday the @entity50 liaison channel in the border area of @entity52 , an important line of communication between the two sides that the @entity3 cut off as tensions flared earlier this year			1
@entity1 officials did n't immediately respond to the @entity3 's latest statement friday			1
the shuttered @entity19 complex is one of the main casualties of the recent period of fiery threats and provocative moves by @entity14			1
in early april , @entity65 's regime began blocking @entity1 from entering the manufacturing complex , which sits on the @entity3 's side of the heavily fortified border and houses the operations of more than 120 @entity1 companies			2
@entity23 then pulled out the more than 50,000 @entity14 who work in the zone 's factories , saying it was temporarily suspending activity there			0
the last @entity1 in the zone left last month			0
the @entity14 decision to halt operations surprised some observers , since @entity19 was considered an important source of hard currency for @entity65 's regime			2
the proposal for talks regarding the complex indicates that " maybe the cost of closure of @entity19 is greater than they had anticipated , " said @entity87 , a senior analyst for the @entity88 covering @entity89			0
at the same time , @entity87 said , @entity14 's key ally , @entity96 , which has expressed displeasure with some of @entity23 's recent behavior , may not have been " as generous as the @entity14 have been expecting in terms of aid , assistance , trade and investment			0
" the @entity3 's menacing rhetoric against the @entity100 and @entity1 hit a fever pitch in march and april after the @entity102 voted in march to slap tougher sanctions on the regime and amid @entity100 - @entity1 military drills in the region			2
the @entity102 sanctions were in response to the @entity3 's third underground nuclear test , which took place in february			0
the @entity100 - @entity1 military exercises have since ended , and @entity23 has toned down the frequency and intensity of its threats			0
@entity14 's behavior suggests it was willing to " go to the brink and try to rattle " new @entity1 president @entity117 and other governments , @entity87 said			2
" but i do n't think that really happened , " he said			0
" @entity1 and its allies in the international community demonstrated their resolve and unwillingness to back down in the face of @entity14 rhetoric			2
" the @entity3 's statement thursday also proposed that the potential talks cover other issues besides the @entity19 complex			1
it mentioned the possibility of resuming cross-border tours at @entity134 , a @entity14 resort where a @entity1 tourist was shot by a @entity14 soldier in 2008 after allegedly walking into an off - limits area			2
@entity23 said the talks could also include " humanitarian issues " such as " the reunion of separated families and their relatives			0
" the @entity14 proposal did not , however , mention anything about the @entity3 's controversial nuclear and missile programs , which lie at the heart of the tensions surrounding @entity14			1
@entity65 's regime chose a symbolic date on which to make its offer of talks			0
june 6 is @entity153 in @entity1 , when citizens commemorate those killed while fighting to protect the country , including during the @entity157 in the early 1950s			0
@entity2 's @entity158 reported from @entity0 , and @entity159 reported and wrote from @entity160 .			0

new : @entity14 proposes " working contact " in @entity19 on sunday
new : it also says it will reopen a communications channel severed during recent tensions
@entity1 has suggested ministerial talks in @entity0 on wednesday
the @entity3 offered the talks to *discuss* the shuttered industrial site and other issues
