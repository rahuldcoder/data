@entity0 -- with the rollout of @entity4 -- the portal for enrollment in the new @entity8 health care exchanges -- getting hammered by critics and users , @entity1 's dr. @entity2 sat down with @entity12 secretary @entity11 for an exclusive interview			1
here are @entity2 's takeaways from the interview : 1			0
full speed ahead i was surprised to learn just how extensive the concerns were before the october 1 rollout			2
congressional investigators claim that just weeks before the planned rollout , more than two - thirds of insurers had concerns about the system being viable by october 1			2
just days before the launch , the website crashed while being tested with just a few hundred people logging in , according to the @entity28			0
despite all that , the @entity29 decided to move forward			0
when i pressed @entity11 on this point , she said , " we moved forward because millions of people have been waiting for health care insurance , " and they did n't want to delay any longer			1
@entity11 on the spot over @entity8 rollout she made that point a few times : a few weeks wo n't make that much of a difference given that open enrollment lasts until the end of march , and that millions more people could have health insurance by that time			1
@entity46 did n't know ? according to @entity11 , president @entity46 was not aware of any significant problems until a " couple days " after the website had been launched			1
the @entity8 is touted as a signature achievement for the @entity46 administration , and it surprised me that the president was not being kept up to speed -- according to @entity11 -- on the concerns around the rollout			1
@entity11 : obamacare website rollout problems blindsided president 3			1
@entity57 late to arrive @entity11 said in order to get the website running smoothly , she has asked that contractors bring in their " best and brightest , " their " a-team			1
" i was surprised that the @entity57 had n't been assembled earlier , given the magnitude of the @entity8 , and the challenge of setting up the website			2
when i pressed the secretary on this point , she just said that she wants new eyes and ears , and to put all hands on deck , working toward a solution as quickly as possible			0
open to delaying fines ? @entity11 did not back down on the individual mandate , which requires people to have health insurance or pay a fine			1
i asked how it was possible that people could face a fine , if they had tried to sign up and were unsuccessful			0
at that point , it seems she might have left the window open to a delay , saying only : " i do n't think that that really is the question right now			2
" " the issue is will people be able to sign up for affordable health care in the six - month open enrollment period ? and i think the answer is absolutely yes			1
" whether or not this issue comes up again is unclear			0
for now , the @entity67 said the individual mandate is here to stay			1
administration to kick off effort to encourage enrollment 5			0
falling on her sword ? finally , i asked her about the calls for her resignation			0
over the past few days , her friend , sen. @entity104 , as well as 2012 @entity106 vice presidential candidate rep. @entity105 , have raised the possibility			0
while not giving a decisive no , @entity11 again reinforced the mission of this task , saying it was the most important job she has ever had			2
she also reinforced that she served at the pleasure of the president .			0

@entity11 said they pressed on with rollout because they did n't want to delay access to health care
fact that president @entity46 was n't being kept informed on biggest *domestic* program was a surprise
" a-team " being called in now amid rollout *debacle* instead of involved much earlier
@entity11 says individual mandate will not be delayed despite website issues
