@entity0 -- a @entity3 writer filed a criminal complaint tuesday against embattled former @entity6 chief @entity5 , alleging attempted rape , according to her attorney @entity8			1
@entity9 , 32 , filed the new claim just as a separate @entity12 case against the @entity3 financier appeared to be on shaky ground			1
a @entity5 lawyer in @entity3 said he had filed a counterclaim against @entity17 for " false declarations			1
" @entity3 prosecutors are expected to review the complaint and determine whether there is enough evidence to press charges			1
though the alleged attack occurred in 2003 , the statute of limitations on attempted rape is 10 years			1
in an interview with the @entity3 news - magazine @entity28 , @entity9 said she decided to act because she was fed up with being labelled a liar , having not previously filed a criminal complaint			1
@entity9 said @entity5 's alleged assault had been widely discussed in light of the charges he faces in @entity12 and she now had a chance to tell her own story and be listened to			1
" if i want one day to put an end to this hell of the past eight years , it has to go to court , " she told the magazine			1
asked about the delay in coming forward to report the attempted rape , @entity9 said it was difficult for all women in this situation			2
she added that she had been reluctant to go over and over the details , when all she wanted to do was forget about it			0
it was even harder to face that prospect when the she knew that the attempt would likely fail , she told @entity28 , because no - one would believe the word of a young writer over a powerful figure like @entity5			2
asked if she had concerns about repercussions for bringing the complaint now , @entity9 told @entity28 she feared reprisals because she was a thorn in the side of the former @entity6 chief on tuesday , her attorney told @entity1 that the alleged attack had taken place with " extreme violence			1
" the new legal fireworks came after questions arose about the truthfulness of a housekeeper who alleged that @entity5 , 62 , attacked her in his @entity12 hotel suite in may			2
@entity9 said the decision to file the complaint had been taken with her lawyer in mid-june and had not been affected by the sudden crumbling of the case against @entity5 in @entity12 , according to her interview with @entity28			1
one of @entity5 's lawyers in @entity12 , @entity77 , on monday declined to comment on the allegations in @entity3			1
@entity9 's mother , @entity80 politician @entity79 , said shortly after the housekeeper 's accusations were splashed across front pages around the world that her daughter had been attacked by @entity5 in 2003 but that she had discouraged her at the time from filing charges against him			1
@entity79 , a member of parliament , said she cautioned @entity87 not to file a police report at the time for fear it would hurt her journalism career			0
on tuesday , she said she had not realized before how much her daughter was affected by the alleged incident			2
" at the time , i never thought that it had traumatized her to such a point , " she told @entity1 affiliate network @entity93			0
@entity9 " expects to be destroyed " after filing the complaint against @entity5 , her mother added			1
but she must " find the combative instinct that is needed to withstand the shock and say to herself , ' ok , i must do this and i will carry it out , ' " @entity79 said			0
@entity5 was never charged in connection with the alleged attack on @entity106			0
but in light of the charges against @entity5 after the alleged incident at a @entity111 hotel in @entity12 , @entity8 said a few weeks ago that he and @entity9 had considered filing a complaint			1
@entity8 said the cases were not connected			0
" i do n't see any reason why these two cases should be joined , because either the prosecutor has enough elements to condemn @entity5 in the @entity118 -- and if he does , he should do it -- or he needs to bring two cases together to get a conviction , " he said in june			0
" in that case , we do not want to participate , " he added			0
@entity5 's attorney in @entity3 , @entity125 , did not respond to requests for comment on the allegations in may			1
@entity79 recently pulled out of the @entity130 presidential primaries			0
@entity5 had been a front - runner for the party nomination until the @entity12 arrest , and suggestions that the case was floundering have revived talk of his chances in next year 's presidential elections			1
@entity79 described herself last week as " the woman who embarrasses the @entity130			0
" " i am ... a sort of collateral damage in the @entity5 affair			0
i knew for a long time that my political career was sealed with this bomb , but i did n't imagine that this bitter past could be revived so violently , " she wrote friday on the @entity145 website , referring to the alleged attack in @entity12			1
in may , @entity79 said that in 2003 , her journalist daughter had interviewed @entity5 in his office in the @entity152			2
however , after the interview , @entity9 received a text message from @entity5 , saying he was not happy with the interview and asking if he could speak with her again , @entity79 said			2
after @entity9 arrived at the address @entity5 had sent her , he locked the door to the room they were in , took her hand and grabbed her arm , according to @entity79			2
@entity9 told him to let her go , and the incident ended with the two struggling on the floor , @entity79 said			1
@entity9 managed to escape the apartment and locked herself in her car , where she called her mother			2
@entity79 said she arrived about an hour and a half later to find her daughter still locked in the car and looking " roughed up			0
" the heel of one shoe was broken , @entity79 recalled			0
but @entity79 told her daughter not to file a complaint out of concern that she would become known as @entity5 's victim			2
@entity1 does not typically identify sexual assault victims , but @entity79 said her daughter gave permission for her name to be disclosed			0
in @entity12 , the prosecution 's case against @entity5 has been shaken in recent days after sources revealed that the housekeeper at the @entity111 hotel had been less than truthful with investigators			1
within two days after the alleged attack occurred , she spoke by phone with a boyfriend in an @entity189 jail in a recorded conversation			0
a source with knowledge of the investigation told @entity1 that the housekeeper said " she 's fine and this person is rich and there 's money to be made , " as originally reported by @entity197			0
the 32 - year - old immigrant has admitted to prosecutors that she lied about her whereabouts following the alleged attack , the details of an asylum application and information she put on tax forms , according to documents filed in court friday by prosecutors			1
prosecutors said friday that the woman also admitted to lying about being a victim of a gang rape			0
in angry remarks delivered outside the courthouse , the woman 's attorney , @entity211 , acknowledged problems with his client 's credibility			2
but the bottom line , he said , is that she was attacked			0
" that was true the day it happened , and it is true today , " @entity211 said			0
" she has described that sexual assault many times to the prosecutors and to me			0
and she has never once changed a single thing about that account			0
" on tuesday , the attorney for the alleged victim 's announced that she had filed a libel lawsuit against the @entity232 and five of its reporters , after the newspaper reported that the woman was a prostitute			1
the woman has accused the newspaper of publishing articles with false and defamatory information in the effort to bolster sales			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity232 , @entity244 , responded to the lawsuit tuesday , saying " we stand by our reporting			2
" meanwhile , the indictment and charges against @entity5 -- including criminal sexual acts and sexual abuse -- still stand			0
and though he is now free to travel in the @entity118 , a judge said authorities have continued to withhold the @entity3 financier 's passport			1
after the charges were filed against him in @entity12 , @entity5 resigned as director of the @entity6			1
@entity1 's @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 and @entity261 contributed to this report .			0
