@entity0 -- a @entity0 billboard that focused exclusively on @entity4 abortion rates was taken down because of concerns for public safety , said @entity7 , spokesperson for @entity9 - based @entity8 , on thursday			1
the billboard was erected by group opposed to abortions			1
the billboard was attached to a building that houses the restaurant @entity16 's kitchen			1
some of the wait staff , @entity7 said , were being harassed by patrons who objected to the billboard			1
in addition , a scheduled protest friday by people opposed to the billboard prompted public safety concerns , which led to the company 's decision			1
@entity7 said the controversy surrounding the billboard did not factor into the company 's decision to take it down			1
" we accepted the copy in accordance with our policy , " @entity7 said			0
" we believe in people 's right to advertise , [ we ] thought it [ the copy ] was ok , [ and ] we stand behind that decision , " @entity7 said			0
the sign , paid for by the organization @entity41 , reads : " the most dangerous place for an @entity4 is in the womb			1
" the billboard , about a half mile from a @entity47 facility in @entity50 's @entity49 neighborhood , featured an african - american girl			1
" they 're attacking women for choosing abortion while simultaneously destroying family planning , " a spokeswoman @entity52 of @entity53 said before the billboard was taken down			1
" their hypocrisy is as large and as obnoxious as this billboard			1
" but @entity62 , a pastor and @entity41 board member , told reporters at a news conference on wednesday that " it 's hard to celebrate @entity67 " with abortion " hanging over our community			2
" " @entity71 is outpacing life in our community " and he said the billboard 's message is meant to be a " provocative " way to illustrate the problem			2
african - americans have high abortion rates compared with other demographic groups , according to @entity80 , a spokeswoman for the @entity81 , a @entity0 - based research center for sexual and reproductive health			1
the disparity is in part attributed to a " lack of adequate services " in many black communities , which " has resulted in more unintended pregnancies , " @entity80 said			0
according to the @entity41 website , the move is an attempt " to raise public awareness of life issues through advertising and raise truths about life issues to educate and empower individuals			2
" the sign was part of a national campaign where more billboards will appear over the next couple of months across the country , @entity41 spokeswoman @entity98 said			0
calls to @entity41 and @entity53 were not returned thursday evening after news of the billboard 's removal broke			2
@entity109 , @entity110 president , released a statement thursday in support of the billboard			2
" @entity41 says it wants to raise public awareness of @entity47 's war on black people			0
good for them , " he said			0
critics say the message is misleading			0
" the issue is here they are doing a campaign , targeting one group of women and making them feel guilty and shameful about family choices that they are making , " @entity52 said			0
" you ca n't take a woman and lift her out of her experience			0
" but the rev. @entity131 , another @entity41 board member , told reporters something needs to be done about abortion in the black community and this is " calling attention to a dramatic event			0
" " this is a truth and tragedy , " he said			0
@entity62 said " the child ( in the billboard ) was selected for her innocence			0
