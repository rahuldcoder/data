-- @entity2 secretary - general @entity1 has said in a letter to the @entity4 that the international mission to destroy @entity7 's chemical weapons is unprecedented and that the team faces many grave dangers			1
the joint mission , made up of personnel from the @entity12 and the @entity2 , is tasked with overseeing the elimination of all @entity7 's chemical weapons by the middle of next year			1
@entity7 began destroying their country 's chemical weapons program sunday under the oversight of an advance team of inspectors from @entity12 , the world 's chemical weapons watchdog , and @entity2 security personnel , @entity1 said			1
@entity7 personnel used " cutting torches and angle grinders to destroy or disable a range of items , " the @entity12 said			0
" this included missile warheads , aerial bombs and mixing and filling equipment			0
" a second team of experts will be sent to @entity7 to " augment the advance team " of experts in the country , the @entity12 said tuesday			2
it did not give a date for their deployment			0
in his letter , sent late monday , @entity1 set out the three phases of the mission : establishing an initial presence and verifying the @entity7 government 's declaration of its stockpiles ; overseeing the destruction of chemical weapons ; and verification of the destruction of any and all chemical weapons - related programs or materials			1
opinion : @entity7 's other crisis the teams going into @entity7 , which include security and medical personnel as well as the weapons inspectors , will have a support base in @entity62 where they can train for and plan their operations , the letter said			1
at the moment , an advance team of about 35 personnel is on the ground in @entity7 , but their numbers will eventually expand to about 100 , @entity1 said			2
they face a " dangerous and volatile " environment , particularly in urban areas such as @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 , the secretary - general warned			2
" heavy artillery , air strikes , mortar barrages and the indiscriminate shelling of civilians areas are commonplace and battle lines shift quickly , " he said			0
given that environment , the mission " will establish a ' light footprint ' in @entity7 , only deploying to @entity7 those personnel whose presence is necessary in the country to perform their tasks , " @entity1 said			2
a civilian " special coordinator " will head the mission and report back to @entity1 and the director - general of the @entity12 , @entity89			0
@entity89 told a session of the @entity12 's executive council tuesday that the developments so far " present a constructive beginning for what will nonetheless be a long and difficult process			0
" tight deadlines the @entity4 resolution that authorized the mission set a deadline of mid- 2014 for @entity7 to destroy its chemical weapons or face consequences			1
under the resolution , the international weapons inspectors must by november 1 complete their initial inspections of all @entity7 chemical weapons and storage facilities and complete the eradication of production and chemical mixing facilities			1

but , he said , the final phase of the mission " will be the most difficult and challenging			0
" over the period of eight months , the team is expected to " support , monitor and verify the destruction of a complex chemical weapons programme involving multiple sites spread over a country engulfed in violent conflict			1
" this includes about 1,000 metric tons of " chemical weapons , agents and precursors that are dangerous to handle , dangerous to transport and dangerous to destroy , " he said			2
the inspectors will sometimes have to cross front lines and move through areas controlled by armed groups hostile to the joint mission 's objectives , @entity1 added			1
the time frame for the phase would be ambitious in the most peaceful of circumstances , he said , but the current conditions make it " an operation the likes of which , quite simply , have never been tried before			0
" @entity7 commitment is key , says @entity1 @entity7 , which has said it will cooperate with the international mission , has made a declaration of its chemical weapons sites			1
@entity1 said the success of the joint mission would " first and foremost " depend on a " sustained , genuine commitment " from the @entity7 government to fulfill its obligations under the @entity157 and cooperate with the inspectors			1
he also called for any states with influence over the various sides in the conflict to support the international mission and ensure the safety of its personnel			0
the only way to bring an end to the " appalling suffering " of the @entity7 people and end the crisis is through a political , not military , process , @entity1 added			0
@entity172 secretary of state @entity171 and @entity174 president @entity173 discussed @entity7 in a 15 - minute conversation tuesday on the sidelines of the @entity177 in @entity178			2
the pair spoke about the @entity2 resolution on destroying @entity7 's chemical weapons , according to a senior @entity183 official , as well as the need to move forward on scheduling peace talks in @entity186 , @entity187 , involving all parties in the conflict			1
@entity7 foreign minister at @entity191 : ' there is no civil war ' there has been some skepticism over whether @entity7 will give up its entire chemical weapons arsenal			1
a defected @entity7 brigadier general , @entity197 , told @entity0 's @entity198 last week that in addition to four secret locations within @entity7 , the regime is currently transferring chemical weapons to @entity203 and @entity204 , an allegation that the commander of the opposition @entity207 , gen. @entity208 , also recently made to @entity198			1
@entity203 and @entity204 have denied the claims			0
the @entity2 resolution , which capped a month of dramatic diplomacy , was based on a deal struck between the @entity172 and @entity174 that averted an @entity172 military strike over allegations the @entity7 government used sarin nerve gas in an august 21 attack on a @entity71 suburb			2
@entity172 officials said at least 1,400 people died in the attack			0
@entity7 denied responsibility , blaming rebel forces			0
