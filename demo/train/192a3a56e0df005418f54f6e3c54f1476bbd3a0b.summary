-- a @entity2 sheriff 's deputy has been fired for liking his boss 's political opponent -- on @entity5			1
now @entity6 is fighting back in court , arguing that a " like " should be protected by his @entity8 right to free speech			1
it 's a case that could settle a significant question at a time when hundreds of millions of people express themselves on @entity5 , sometimes merging their personal , professional and political lives in the process			2
according to court documents , the case began when sheriff @entity19 of @entity20 , @entity2 , fired @entity6 and five other employees for supporting his rival in a 2009 election			1
@entity6 's offense ? clicking the omnipresent @entity5 thumbs - up to follow the page " @entity27			1
" @entity19 , of course , won re-election , leading to the firings			0
free - speech advocates argue that the " like " should have been clearly protected by @entity6 's right to freedom of expression			1
but a @entity37 @entity36 judge in @entity2 ruled differently saying , in effect , that free - speech protections do n't kick in when someone does n't actually say something			1
" liking a @entity5 page is insufficient speech to merit constitutional protection , " judge judge @entity45 wrote in his may ruling , because it does n't " involve actual statements			1
" @entity6 is appealing that ruling in the @entity50			2
the appeal was filed last week , and the sheriff 's lawyers are expected to respond by next month			1
@entity6 's advocates argue the judge 's definition of free speech does n't match existing law			1
" the judge is wrong in the sense that the @entity5 button actually says the word ' like , ' so there are actually words being used , " said @entity59 , a senior staff attorney with the @entity60 , which has filed a brief supporting @entity6 's appeal			1
" and there 's a thumbs - up symbol , which most people understand means they , literally , like something			2
" @entity5 itself also has weighed in with a brief to the court , saying that a " like " for a political candidate is " the 21st - century equivalent of a front - yard campaign sign			2
" " a campaign endorsement in particular need not be elaborate or lengthy to constitute political speech , " the site 's lawyers wrote			0
" @entity6 need not have published a detailed analysis of the competing candidates ' platforms for his speech to warrant @entity8 protection			1
his endorsement of his preferred candidate is enough			0
" with the @entity90 in full swing , the @entity60 's @entity59 compared it to another wordless moment -- the two @entity37 sprinters who defiantly raised gloved fists in a " black power " salute on the medals stand during the @entity98 in @entity99			1
" they did n't say any words , " he said , " but they clearly sent a message			0
" @entity104 is a professor of @entity105 at @entity106 and author of 2007 's " speechless : the erosion of @entity110 in the @entity111			0
" he calls the argument used in the lower court ruling " ridiculous " and " on its face absurd			0
" @entity104 believes if the appeals court upholds that judgment , it could make it much easier for employers to clamp down on their workers ' speech on social networks such as @entity5 and @entity125 as well as on personal blogs and other sites			2
" if , as a lot of people expect , the appeals court overrules this and says this is obviously protected speech , then it may be that this case does n't really establish a great amount of new law , " he said			2
" that 's the outcome a lot of people might expect			0
" but if it goes the other way , then it really does change things , at least in the legal realm			0
that would have , potentially , a significant effect			0
" @entity104 notes that the @entity2 case is the latest in a string of legal disputes that have arisen between employers and employees based on the increasingly popular use of social media			2
last year , gadget - review site @entity152 sued @entity154 , a former employee , for taking with him a @entity125 account he built while at the company to promote his work for other sites			0
and , last year , the @entity159 weighed in on behalf of an ambulance driver who had been fired because of a negative @entity5 post about the company for which he drove			2
the board said the company 's policy , which prohibited negative comments by its employees on the @entity169 , was too broad			0
in february , the two sides settled the case			0
" i think that employers are often too concerned about his stuff and about their employees , " @entity104 said			0
" ( social media ) has just become so common , so ubiquitous			0
" it 's not clear how long it will take @entity6 's case to move through the court system			1
after the sheriff 's lawyers respond , @entity6 's attorneys will get one more chance			1
then , the court could take several months to hear further arguments and , ultimately , issue a ruling .			0

@entity2 deputy says he was fired for liking sheriff 's opponent on @entity5

@entity37 *district* judge ruled his @entity5 " like " was n't protected by @entity8
