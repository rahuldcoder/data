for the most part , train terminals are desperate places			0
they 're an unavoidable evil linking us to somewhere else -- but not before assaulting us with tepid coffee , drafty waiting rooms and smelly , ugly ticket halls			0
@entity10 's @entity9 , which turns 100 this month , is a glorious exception			1
but it 's not just its iconic opal - faced clock ( a century old and valued at more than $ 10 million ) , flawless marble staircases ( modeled on those in the @entity16 ) and gleaming chandeliers ( fitted with 35,000 custom - designed , low - energy light bulbs ) that lend @entity9 a sense of golden age grandeur			1
the terminal -- not station , never station -- also has a fascinating history , with stories to rival @entity10 's better known , pointier landmarks			2
listen : @entity9 's 100th birthday 1913 : grand opening while trains had been running in and out of @entity10 since 1871 , it was n't until the completion of @entity9 in 1913 that @entity32 had itself a world renowned transportation icon			1
the @entity35 family constructed the 48 - acre site ( the little polished brass acorns adorning every clock and light fixture reflect the family symbol ) , inadvertently triggering a 20 - year @entity42 construction boom that added the likes of the @entity44 and @entity45 to the city 's skyline			2
if it were n't for @entity9 , all those 1990s disaster movies would have looked very different			2
1942 : a president rolls in at 200 feet , @entity9 boasts the deepest basement in @entity32			1
this is where some of the terminal 's shadiest secrets are concealed			2
among them is a hidden platform connecting a presidential getaway train to an area beneath the @entity60 hotel			0
the secret platform was constructed for @entity62 during @entity63 the polio - suffering president 's armored carriage was specifically designed to limit lateral movement , allowing him to travel while keeping his disability secret from the @entity70 public			1
so why is it still a rusty relic beneath @entity9 , rather than a museum showpiece ? simple : it weighs 142 metric tons -- you try moving it			2
1944 : winning the war another of the terminal 's great subterranean secrets is @entity82 -- a hidden basement and the deepest accessible underground point in @entity10			1
not that you 'll ever go there -- the existence of the area was officially denied by the building 's owners until the late 1980s and it does n't even appear on the original blueprints			2
so what 's the big secret ? the room -- named after @entity9 's @entity96 location -- houses a series of rotary converters , which , back in the 1930s , provided the power that electrified the terminal 's 63 tracks			1
during @entity63 , these tracks linked thousands of shaven grunts and other instruments of war to the ports that would ship them out to the front lines			0
despite @entity9 's strategic significance , however , a bucket of sand tipped into one of these converters would have been enough to bring the terminal -- and 80 % of the country 's eastbound military movement -- to a standstill			1
this vulnerability was nearly exploited by a pair of @entity122 saboteurs in november 1944 , but their plot was scuppered by an @entity126 manhunt			1
commuters join celebrities for @entity9 's 100th birthday 1957 : to infinity ( but not much further ) a small hole in the ceiling of the main concourse , just near the constellation of @entity135 , is an unlikely legacy of the space race			1
the hole was left behind after a @entity139 rocket was hoisted up inside the terminal in an attempt to get the @entity70 public excited about space exploration			1
so eager was the government to counteract anxiety around the @entity148 @entity147 launch , that it forgot to check whether the rocket would fit in the building			0
1968 : demolition looms by the late 1960s , the growing popularity of interstate highways and air travel had taken a toll on the country 's railroads , leaving @entity9 a stinking , hobo - infested eyesore			2
it was condemned to be demolished until the @entity159 stepped in to declare the building a historic landmark			0
@entity9 was saved , but there was still the problem of what to do with the guys and gals using the @entity168 masterpiece as their own personal living quarters and latrine			2
rather than force out the homeless , city officials addressed each and every member of @entity9 's homeless community on a case - by - case basis			1
the vast majority ended up in permanent housing			0
1990 : a green role model while these days you 'll do well to walk more than half a @entity10 block without tripping over some sort of green waste initiative , back in the early 1990s , @entity10 was chugging out as much co2 as everyone else			0
setting an example for contemporary recycling programs , @entity9 overnight became the biggest recycling plant in the @entity70 when it introduced newspaper bins in 1990 , collecting five tons of waste in its first day			1
however , not everyone loved the scheme			0
when the @entity194 noticed the introduction of the bins coincided with a hefty dent in sales ( thanks to commuters salvaging dumped papers rather than buying their own ) , they reacted swiftly			0
since 2001 , they 've been paying a significant fee each year to maintain craftily designed bins that prevent people from removing discarded papers			0
1998 : a lick of paint @entity9 's mid- 1990s makeover took 12 years to complete			1
during this time everything from light bulbs to the gigantic ceiling skyscape were painstakingly scraped , scrubbed and polished back to their prewar glory			0
but what do you do when the quarries from which you procured your original marble have closed ? order them to be reopened , of course , and , while you 're at it , pull masonry technicians out of retirement to make sure everything is properly prepared and fitted			0
this goes some way to explaining why the whole restoration project cost more than $ 160 million			0
2000s : top of the shops of the 700,000 people who pass through @entity9 every day , an estimated 10,000 do n't have a ticket			2
they 're not fare dodgers , they 're shoppers , who together shell out $ 150 million every year on lattes , oyster dinners , macbooks and more			0
the terminal houses 50 shops , 20 casual eateries and five restaurants and cocktail lounges			0
in terms of spend per square foot , that makes the terminal the most commercially successful shopping center in the @entity70			1
2008 : a viral hit @entity9 has been immortalized in scores of @entity248 movies -- credits include " @entity255 , " " @entity256 , " " @entity257 " and , um , " @entity258 " -- but by far its most memorable theatrical moment came when drama collective @entity251 scared rush hour commuters with this incredible stunt			2
more than 200 of the group 's " agents " froze perfectly still , in unison , for five minutes , giving everyone else the impression that they 'd just stumbled upon some cataclysmic rift in the space - time continuum			0
the result ? more @entity269 views than @entity270			0
2012 : storm savior while its 100 - year history has seen it take on the role of everything from government propaganda auditorium to glitzy shopping mall , @entity9 remains a transportation hub , and an efficient one			1
just as it did on 9/11 -- when , despite all other transport networks shutting down , it had the city evacuated by 2 p.m. -- @entity9 played a key role in getting @entity32 to safety ahead of october 's superstorm @entity283			1
very rarely has the terminal 's marble concourse looked as cavernous as it did when the last @entity287 train fled to higher ground -- probably not since the @entity289 declared @entity9 open almost 100 years previously , in fact			1
@entity291 : photos from the centennial celebration 2013 : 100 up on february 1 , 2013 , this grand dame of the railway world celebrates its 100th birthday			0
a brass band will play on the main concourse , actors , poets and celebrities will swan around and shops and restaurants will adopt a 1913 pricing strategy -- including 6 cents for a loaf of rye bread from @entity307 and $ 2 for silk scarves from @entity309			0
@entity9 , 87 e. 42nd st. , @entity32 ; open daily from 5:30 a.m. -2 a.m. ; @entity311 details about centennial celebrations can be found online .			1

@entity9 's opening turned @entity32 into a world renowned transport icon
@entity122 sabotage event in 1944 *foiled* by the @entity126
today , terminal is as much a *tourist* destination as a transport hub
per square foot , it 's the most commercially successful shopping center in @entity70
