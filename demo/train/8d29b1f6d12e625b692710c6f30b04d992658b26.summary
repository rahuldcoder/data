-- former hostages held at the @entity2 in @entity3 are hoping the @entity4 for " @entity8 " boosts their efforts to be paid reparations for the ordeal			1
" ' @entity8 ' was a great motion picture ; it was a great story			1
but it 's only part of the story , " says former hostage @entity11			2
unlike the six whose escape to the @entity18 @entity2 was featured in the movie , he was one of the 52 who were held for 444 days in the @entity22 embassy			1
he and other former hostages believe @entity3 has never been held accountable for the episode and should have to pay each of them restitution			1
" we feel that we should be entitled to some compensation , " he said			0
@entity11 said that during his captivity , he spent four days in solitary confinement			0
at the end , he was so desperate that he slashed both wrists with a broken drinking glass			0
" my shirt , pants , and shoes were soaked in blood , " he said			0
" i was prepared to die			0
" attorney @entity39 , who has represented the hostages in court for years , is seeking about $ 4 million apiece in damages			2
coming soon : @entity3 's response to ' @entity8 ' " they were beaten ; they played @entity49 roulette with them , they stood them up against walls as if they were killing them in mock firing squads , " he said			1
" they destroyed in many cases not only their bodies , but their souls			1
" @entity11 was hospitalized and survived the grueling ordeal			2
but even today , he said : " i still have occasional ( and sometimes not so occasional ) nightmares and flashbacks			0
in my most common nightmare , the deal made to release us has been rescinded , and we have to go back into captivity			0
" even now , he said , " i get feelings of panic and claustrophobia sometimes			0
it 's never really behind you			2
" the hostages were released in january 1981 under a set of agreements , the @entity76 , which stipulated that the hostages could not sue @entity3 for damages			1
but for years , many of them have sought compensation anyway , arguing that an agreement made under duress at gunpoint is not valid			0
@entity0 called and e-mailed @entity3 's mission to the @entity86 for comment but did not receive a response			1
the @entity89 , however , has argued against breaking the agreement , saying that if the @entity22 were to renege on the @entity92 deal , the decision would call into question @entity22 's commitment to honoring all its other treaties and agreements as well			1
@entity97 , @entity18 ' hero ' in hostage crisis , dies " the @entity22 government remains deeply grateful to the former hostages for their service to their country , and expresses its sympathy for the suffering they experienced during their ordeal , " the @entity89 said in a statement			1
" as an essential condition of their release from captivity , however , the @entity22 agreed in the @entity76 to bar claims by the former hostages against @entity3 from @entity22 courts			1
although we understand their frustration , we are bound by this commitment and must continue to honor it			0
" the courts have sided with the @entity89 , and in 2012 , the @entity120 declined to hear the hostages ' appeal			2
now the group is pushing @entity124 for an alternative			0
instead of being compensated with @entity3 government money , which sits in frozen accounts , they propose using money collected from fines against companies caught violating the embargo against @entity3			1
" even though these fines will probably not come directly from the @entity3 , " says @entity11 , " i think it will to some degree right a wrong			1
" as part of their efforts to persuade lawmakers , the group is assembling a package of testimonials from the former hostages			2
one former hostage who will not be able to tell @entity124 his story : former @entity146 agent @entity145 , who committed suicide in october			0
he was beaten in his cell and subjected to mock executions during captivity , and after his release , he became a recluse and an alcoholic , according to @entity39			0
" in reality , his life was taken from him 33 years ago , " he said .			0

" @entity8 , " about the rescue of six @entity22 hostages from @entity3 , wins @entity4
