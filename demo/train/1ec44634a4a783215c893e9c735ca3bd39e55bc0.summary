-- @entity1 stunned @entity2 2 - 1 tuesday to leave the @entity4 leaders struggling to qualify from @entity5 of the @entity6			1
@entity7 put @entity1 ahead in the first half before @entity9 equalized for @entity11 's men , who have failed to repeat their sublime domestic form in @entity14 competition			2
@entity7 scored the eventual winner just after the break to leave @entity1 second in the group behind @entity19 , who beat @entity21 3 - 1 to clinch their passage to the last 16 knockout stage			1
it was a pulsating encounter in @entity1 's @entity26 stadium , with the most intense drama reserved after @entity28 's @entity7 , a reported transfer target for big - spending @entity2 , had beaten @entity30 with a low shot to put his side 2 - 1 ahead			1
@entity2 pushed forward in desperate hope of an equalizer but a mistake by @entity36 let in @entity37			0
his shot beat @entity30 , it thumped the post and bounced clear			0
@entity40 hit @entity41 for six in @entity42 @entity43 played in the ever dangerous @entity9 but @entity44 did superbly to block the shot , while at the other end @entity30 denied @entity47 , who was clean through			0
finally , a brilliant move between @entity49 and substitute @entity50 gave @entity9 a further opportunity , but he headed over			0
@entity2 , who were beaten 2 - 0 by @entity19 in the infamous match in which @entity54 allegedly refused to come on as a substitute , must now beat the @entity57 giants in their final group match at the @entity59 to have any chance of going through			1
but a @entity1 victory over @entity21 in their last fixture would see the @entity64 club advance with @entity19 regardless of that result			1
@entity19 made no mistake in their @entity67 as @entity68 and @entity69 put them 2 - 0 up inside 24 minutes			2
@entity70 pulled one back for the visitors before @entity68 , with his second , wrapped up the win			0
@entity2 's illustrious city neighbors @entity76 are also making heavy weather of qualifying from @entity79 as they were held 2 - 2 at home by @entity81			1
they fell behind to a @entity83 own goal at @entity84 before a neat header from @entity86 , playing in place of the injured @entity88 , saw the home side level			0
when @entity90 put @entity92 's men ahead in the second half after a spell of intense pressure they looked set to wrap up the victory to take command of the group			0
but a casual clearance from @entity76 goalkeeper @entity100 led to @entity81 's equalizer as @entity103 's cross slammed into @entity104 and fell to @entity106 veteran @entity105 , who gratefully accepted the chance			2
@entity81 and @entity76 are level on nine points , but the @entity110 side will go through as the group winners if they beat @entity113 minnows @entity112 in their final group game in @entity115 next month			2
they have a better head - to - head record with @entity76 , who must gain at least a point at @entity120 side @entity119 to qualify for the last 16			0
@entity119 , who beat @entity112 3 - 2 on tuesday , will go through with a win over @entity76 .			1

@entity1 beat @entity2 2 - 1 in @entity6 @entity5
@entity7 scores twice to sink @entity4 leaders
@entity19 seal passage to last 16 with 3 - 1 win over @entity21
@entity76 held 2 - 2 at home by @entity81 in @entity79
