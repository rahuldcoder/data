-- walking into one of @entity3 's infinity rooms is like walking into a completely different universe			1
the door shuts behind you , and suddenly you find yourself surrounded by what appears to be a galaxy of shimmering leds			0
the scene is beautiful , in a surreal , space - age fairy tale sort of way			0
but it 's also a little jarring in its intimacy ; it 's almost as though you 've been instantly transported from a whitewashed gallery into @entity3 's buzzing , obsessive mind			2
it 's a strange place to inhabit , if only because you get the sense that what goes on inside @entity3 's mind is very different than what 's happening inside , say , your neighbor 's , or your colleague 's			2
the @entity25 artist has lived in a @entity25 mental institution since the 1970s , when she checked herself in after a particularly stressful stint in @entity28			1
but @entity3 's struggle with obsessive compulsive disorder and other mental anguishes is not a shameful secret			1
in fact , it 's the opposite			0

for as long as @entity3 has been an artist ( she 's currently in her mid- 80s ) , she 's been obsessed with polka - dots			1
a result of hallucinations she 's had since childhood , the shapes are plastered across her paintings , on her clothes , and incorporated into her trippy infinity rooms			2
it 's not hyperbole to say they are everywhere			0
including her newly opened show at the @entity57 in @entity28			1
in " i who have arrived in @entity66 " , @entity3 continues the motif with 27 new paintings and two infinity rooms , all covered in dots of varying shapes and sizes			1
the colorful large - scale paintings covered in eyes and dots are beautiful works in their own right , but the real reason most people will trek to the @entity75 gallery and wait in the 4 - hour line is to see @entity3 's brilliant mirrored infinity rooms			1
@entity78 from @entity79 on @entity80			0
@entity3 has been making these magical boxes since the 1960s , when she first lined a small room with mirrors and filled it with polka - dotted phallic shapes , creating what i like to imagine a brothel in the dr. @entity90 universe might look like			1
her newest room , " the souls of millions of @entity98 , " is more along the lines of her beloved " @entity93 , " a mirrored infinity room that showcased hundreds of warm - hued leds at the @entity96 last year			0
read more : mind - blowing portraits made of test tubes and pushpins in her new room , @entity3 has again suspended multi-colored @entity95 from the ceiling at varying lengths that reflect off of the mirrored walls and shallow pool on the floor in a strobe light pattern that repeats itself every 45 seconds			1
just down the street at the gallery 's connected space is another infinity room , " @entity114 , which this time is filled with brightly colored inflatable sculptures covered in polka dots that shoot up from the floor and hang from the ceiling like technicolor tentacles			0
the artist says the kaleidoscopic rooms are her attempt to investigate life , death and infinity , and if you 're prone to existential pondering , it 's easy to see that connection			2
contemplating the infinite does have a way of drudging up those " what 's it all mean ? " feelings			0
but for most people , being inside @entity3 's glimmering universe is simply a brief reprieve from a dulled world they left on the other side of the door			2
for a moment , you can almost forget about the line waiting outside , the 360 degrees of mirrors and ultimately , yourself			0
but just for a momentâ € ” because there 's no way you 're leaving without taking a selfie			0
i who have arrived in @entity66 will be at @entity152 through december 21 read more from @entity0 : powerful photos go @entity155 's @entity154 how a @entity156 hacked @entity157 to find @entity158 the @entity159 of @entity160 from space a @entity162 - saving contraptions 11 @entity164 to stream in 2014 subscribe to @entity0 for less than $ 1 an issue and get a free gift ! click here ! copyright 2011 @entity168 .			0
