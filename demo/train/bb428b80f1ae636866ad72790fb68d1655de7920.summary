@entity2 @entity0 was more than a landslide win for congressional @entity4 -- it was a historic moment for black @entity4 in particular			1
come january , newly elected representatives @entity7 of @entity8 and @entity9 from @entity10 along with sen. @entity11 -- who won election to the @entity14 seat he had been appointed to -- will make up the largest number of black @entity4 serving in a single @entity16 since @entity17			1
changing demographics -- a growing @entity20 population in particular -- spell trouble for @entity4 national candidates and the party is eager to broaden its appeal to minorities to help them win the presidency in 2016 and beyond			1
the key question is whether these three conservative politicians from red states can help woo more black voters to a party that has struggled to attract them for decades			1
" ( @entity4 ) made black voter engagement a top priority by committing time , talent and resources across the country in pivotal states and urban centers			1
the midterm results are the beginning fruits of that labor , " said @entity39 , a spokesperson for the @entity40 , who acknowledged there was still much more work to be done			0
a racial controversy over a speech a top a @entity50 @entity4 gave to white supremacists while a state politician in 2002 , could make that work harder			1
and it 's not clear that simply having a black candidate draws more black voters , said @entity1 contributor and polling expert @entity57 , pointing to the two @entity14 races in @entity60 , where both @entity61 , a white @entity4 , and @entity11 were running			1
@entity11 brought in 10 % of the black vote to @entity61 's 6 %			2
" that tells me that having a black @entity4 on a ballot gets a handful of votes , " @entity57 said			1
" it may increase the @entity4 share of black vote by low single digits			1
" the @entity4 's focus so far has been more on biography than ideology -- finding black candidates who fit the conservative mold but have a compelling story that could appeal to blacks			1
@entity7 , the @entity78 former mayor of @entity79 , @entity8 , first made a splash on the national stage as a speaker at the @entity83 in 2012			0
she stressed her background as a child of @entity87 immigrants who arrived in @entity88 with $ 10 in their pocket and raised her with an ethos of self - reliance			2
arriving on @entity92 for new members ' orientation shortly after @entity95 , @entity7 stressed her desire to represent everyone , regardless of race or gender			0
" all the issues that we face in this country , they 're not black issues , they 're not white issues , they 're not gender - specific , they 're people issues and i 'm doing everything i can to get the decision making closest to people , " she said as she made her way to the welcome reception			1
her campaign to become the first black @entity4 woman ever elected to @entity16 focused on conservative principles like local control of education and blasting @entity120			1
@entity11 , who is the first black senator elected in the @entity121 , has focused on issues like tax reform , expanding school choice and reigning in government spending			2
but he has also addressed the historic nature of his election			0
" in @entity60 , in @entity88 , it takes a generation to go from having a grandfather who is picking cotton to a grandson in @entity16 , " he wrote in a series of tweets			1
" we are thankful for those trailblazers who came before us and said the status quo was not enough			0
" he added : " we have too many young people being trapped in poverty because other people are defining them with low expectations			0
" campaign ads for @entity9 , a former @entity144 officer from @entity145 , emphasized issues like securing the border and his respect for conservative values that he said would help create jobs			0
he is the first black @entity4 @entity151 have ever sent to @entity16 , but he told @entity1 , his victory went beyond race			1
related : @entity4 agenda for @entity16 " it 's exciting , " @entity9 said outside new member check in station at a @entity92 hotel			1
" when my parents moved to @entity145 in 1970 , there were houses they were n't allowed to get because of the color of their skin and now they have a son , you know , who 's in @entity16 , and to me this is a victory for the voters of @entity10 and the voters of my district that have gotten beyond skin color			1
" @entity9 was elected with the help of white and @entity20 voters , while @entity7 and @entity11 won with support mostly from white voters			1
black turnout for certain @entity4 candidates this year hit double - digits in @entity179 ( 12 % ) , in @entity180 , @entity60 and @entity181 ( 10 % ) and in @entity182 , where @entity4 gov. @entity183 won 26 % of the black vote			1
it 's news @entity4 are applauding as a sign the party is making inroads with black voters , whose strong @entity191 leanings are well documented			1
potential presidential hopeful sen. @entity192 , @entity193 , believes that the @entity4 could attract blacks in even bigger numbers			2
" if @entity4 have a clue and do this and go out and ask every @entity199 for their vote , i think we can transform an election in one cycle and that does n't mean that we go to a majority of @entity199 votes in one cycle but i think there 's fully a third of the @entity199 vote that is open to much of the message , because much of what @entity191 have offered has n't worked , " @entity192 told @entity196			2
that 's wishful thinking , analysts say			0
while the election of @entity7 , @entity9 and @entity11 is a good sign for republicans as they try to broaden their base , it 's important not to read too much into their wins , said @entity224 , director of the @entity226 's @entity225			2
" obviously , he 's dreaming , " @entity224 said , of @entity192 's goal of capturing one - third of the black vote			2
" i just do n't think it 's practical to spend a lot of time and money on the @entity199 - @entity199 vote because it 's so heavily @entity191 and so intensely @entity191			0
look at the intensity of @entity199 support and it 's very high			0
" in the last two presidential elections , more than 90 % of black voters supported the @entity240 , @entity241 , who also happened to be black			1
but even in 1972 , the most recent low - point in terms of black vote share , the white @entity240 @entity242 got a whopping 82 %			2
one big problem is the perception that the @entity4 is not as open to minorities			2
a september analysis by @entity250 , the @entity50 editor for the nonpartisan @entity251 , found that in 1950 , 98 % of @entity50 @entity191 and 97 % of @entity252 were white men			0
by this year , 89 % of @entity252 were white men			0
just 47 % of @entity191 , by comparison , are white men			0
" they won by getting white voters , " said @entity255 , national editor for the @entity251			0
" if @entity4 do n't have policies that attract minority voters , then having candidates who are minority is n't going to be enough			1
" @entity192 is one exception on the policy front , a @entity4 whose focus on criminal justice issues like incarceration rates and other matters , like school choice , appears aimed at drawing black support			1
while that outreach is significant , it 's not clear he is speaking for anyone else in his party , said @entity275 , a @entity1 senior political analyst and editorial director for the @entity277			0
so for now , it seems that the biggest impact these black @entity4 may be having is on white @entity4			1
" here is what we see happening throughout the country , people are aligning their votes for values and voting for candidates who are not of their own complexion , " @entity11 told @entity1 's @entity280 the day after the election			0
meanwhile , the @entity291 , which is dominated by @entity191 , is ready to accept the new class of black @entity4 with open arms and say they could help improve bipartisanship			1
" i 've reached out to congratulate all of the newly elected @entity199 members of @entity16 on their win , including @entity299 and @entity9 , and to invite them to join the @entity291 , " said @entity291 chair rep. @entity295 , @entity296			1
" government is most effective when both parties work together for the greater good of the country			0
i have no doubt that all of the new members of the @entity291 will bring their own unique perspective and skills , further solidifying our strength as a caucus			0
" @entity7 , @entity9 and @entity11 are being sworn in as the @entity4 deals with a controversy over majority whip @entity315 's 2002 speech to a white nationalist group run by former @entity318 leader and neo-nazi @entity319			2
the then - state - representative has apologized for speaking to the group and said he did not know about it 's racist leanings			0
house speaker @entity325 , @entity326 , and majority leader @entity327 , @entity328 , have thrown their support behind @entity315 and rep. @entity331 , @entity332 , an @entity199 who is also the only @entity240 in the @entity332 congressional delegation has also come to his defense			0
congresswoman - elect @entity7 released her own statement of support			2
" i believe he should remain in leadership			0
there 's one quality that he has that i think is very important in leadership , and that 's humility			0
and he 's actually shown that in this case , " @entity7 said on @entity346 's " @entity345			0
" " he 's apologized , and i think that we need to move on and get the work of the @entity199 people done			0
" still , @entity1 political commentator and @entity4 strategist @entity351 acknowledged the controversy could complicate the party 's efforts to expand its appeal to minorities heading into 2016			2
" it certainly presents challenges anytime you are a party like ours that has demographic challenges and is trying to overcome those demographic challenges , " @entity351 said			0
" this will be an element in that conversation			0
what 's important is that we address it head - on , and that we continue to promote an agenda that is going to attract more @entity199 voters , that 's going to attract more @entity20 voters , that 's going to attract more @entity199 candidates to run within our party			2

the new @entity16 will feature three black republicans , a record
republicans reached double - digit support from black voters in some states
but experts say the @entity4 has a long way to go before it attracts a large percentage of black voters
