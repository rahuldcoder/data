on july 17 , 1984 , president @entity0 signed into law the @entity2 , which withheld a percentage of highway funds from any state that did n't raise the minimum drinking age to 21			1
the week before , @entity0 had declared ice cream a " nutritious " food			1
perhaps that 's a hint that politicians do n't always know what 's best for your health			2
thirty years later , there is a group of people with @entity17 and @entity18 who take issue with the drinking age			1
they say , from a scientific standpoint , that the law may target the wrong teen behavior			1
solving one public health crisis the law came into being to solve a serious public health problem			1
before the minimum drinking age law , 16 - to 20 - year - olds were the most common drunken drivers			1
when the drinking age was raised , the number of fatal crashes involving a young driver dropped significantly , from 61 % in 1982 to 31 % in 1995			1
it went down more for that age group than any older age group			2
but while the law did have a significant impact on drinking and driving , it did not stop kids from drinking			1
in fact , it may have made drinking even more appealing to teens , whose brains naturally seek out risk more than adult brains do -- without considering what the consequences might be			1
a survey of students at 56 colleges across the country just a couple years after the legislation passed found that " significantly more under - age students drank compared to those of legal age			1
" this study concluded that " the increase in purchase age appears to have been not only ineffective but actually counter-productive , at least in the short run			2
" the definition of adulthood is not clear - cut when it comes to science			2
" there 's no magic that happens physically to someone when they are 21 as compared to age 18 , " said dr. @entity74 , a professor of pediatric neurology at @entity76			2
the @entity77 ( @entity78 ) says that drawing a single line between adolescence and adulthood under the law is at odds with developmental science			1
they say adolescence usually begins at about age 10 and ends around 19 , but really it depends ; maturity is based on an individual 's experiences			2
developing brains current data from the @entity94 on @entity95 and @entity96 , the two official surveys that monitor such topics , suggest that roughly 65 % of college students ( generally aged 18 to 22 ) drink alcohol in any given month			1
most of the college students who choose to drink are binge drinking , according to a study out of @entity102			1
seven out of 10 are consuming five or more drinks in a row			0
binge drinking can have a damaging impact on a developing brain			1
evidence suggests that heavy exposure to alcohol can cause irreversible brain damage and cognitive deficits , including memory problems			0
scientists say the teenage years are one of the most important times for brain development , next to infancy			1
neurons in the brain are growing and strengthening , connections are developing to allow the brain to transmit information faster and allow the brain to process more complex thoughts , and the brain goes through a kind of pruning process to eliminates synapses that are infrequently used			1
all this brain development has a huge impact on a person 's development and mental well - being			0
it also means that young people have lapses in judgment during this time period as they try to figure out how to be adults			0
the limbic system , the part of your brain that is involved in processing social and emotional information , develops early in adolescents			0
but the prefrontal cortex , the part of the brain that involves judgment , impulse control and abstract thought and the ability to anticipate the consequences of your actions , is n't fully shaped until your late 20s			0
mimicking behavior @entity155 , associate professor of psychology at @entity157 , has spent her career trying to understand what happens with the typical adolescent brain			0
@entity155 argues that if anything , in terms of biology , the age limits on driving and drinking should be flipped			2
" if i were queen for the day , i would move the drinking age to 18 and maybe not let them drive until they were 21 , at least not with other people besides your parents in the car , " @entity155 said			2
she likes the idea of graduated driver 's license laws that slowly let young drivers have more responsibility as they get more practice in the car			0
this is based on the theory that they will learn how to avoid accidents as they gain experience			0
the statistics back her up			0
before states introduced graduated licensing systems during the first six months of solo driving , newly licensed drivers were about eight times more likely to be involved in fatal crashes than more experienced drivers			0
" we all know adolescents are obsessed with learning from their peers			0
... adolescents learn based on experience			0
they are not good at learning abstractly ; that 's what changes a lot between 18 and 21			0
when you get older , you can learn from reading stories about people and by really feeling for other people			0
" @entity155 believes that society could use the way young people learn , to help them learn how to drink responsibly at an earlier age			2
if drinking were less of a clandestine affair , perhaps a teen 's peers could model more appropriate behavior for younger participants			1
she says it 's important to learn how to behave around alcohol			0
" find me a business dinner that you will go to where you are not offered alcohol , " @entity155 challenged			0
" in our society , you do need to know what do around it and how much you can handle			0
" @entity227 teens miss prom after passing breathalyzer tests @entity230 : get real , lower drinking age to 19			1

thirty years *ago* , @entity0 signed the @entity2
scientists say the law makes drinking more appealing to teens
younger drinkers binge drink more often , which can hurt developing brains
