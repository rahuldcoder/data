-- take a close look at the icon that @entity3 created for their new @entity5 app and you 'll notice a few things			1
it points out the location of @entity3 headquarters at 1 @entity11 , but the red pin has been replaced by a blue line , one that leads away from their main building and suggests that you make a hard right through the median to jump onto the freeway			1
from a tactical point of view , in their growing fight against @entity23 , rushing out a new map application made sense			0
but the app itself is clearly worse than the one it replaced , and an audience used to constant improvements and refinements is n't happy			1
meticulous attention to detail , once the hallmark of the @entity3 brand , seems to have been pushed aside for corporate competition , leaving everybody wondering what 's next			1
maps is the most obvious misstep , but it is n't the only one @entity3 has made recently			1
there has been a trail of failures and dead ends the past few years that people do n't talk nearly as much about			0
they include @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and the ongoing mess that is the desktop version of @entity53			0
and @entity54 is clunky because it 's about trying to change the way we work , whether we like it or not			0
so what happened , and what does it mean for the future of the most successful technology company of our lifetime ? opinion : @entity3 seems to have gotten a little bit lost what @entity67 saw was that the true promise of technology was to combine software and hardware in a way that would create a rich user experience			1
instead of giving users what they were asking for , he succeeded by constantly giving people things they did n't even know they wanted until they held it in their hands			0
now everyone has come to expect a certain kind of perfection and showmanship from @entity3 that can only happen when you 're revealing things that are so new and different that users find themselves gasping in surprise and delight			2
@entity3 has been able to do that for quite a while with a brilliant visionary at the helm			2
but having totally redefined the consumer electronics landscape , @entity3 now finds itself without a creative leader and caught in the expectations of its own success			2
as users become more comfortable with the devices they have , there 's a justified sense of entitlement that the application they 've come to rely on will continue to provide the functionality they 've come to expect			0
to put it another way , discovering that there 's no longer transit directions when you 're looking to find the bus home is never a nice surprise			0
despite some neat new features , the @entity113 lacks any of the usual big ideas that take out the sting			0
instead , the new operating system cleans up some dirty corners and puts on a fresh coat of digital paint to get ready for bigger changes down the road			0
but slow and steady wo n't win the race			0
when it comes to incremental steps , @entity23 , @entity125 and @entity126 are all experts at software that may not start out great , amazing or different but clearly improves through iteration			1
and @entity23 is busy buying companies like @entity133 and @entity134 to quickly corner the market on rich , valuable data in a way that @entity3 will never be able to			2
without the ability to launch a new platform as bold as the @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 , it gets harder and harder for @entity3 to truly innovate			1
the problem is n't that @entity3 is failing to do what it has always done , it 's that its ability to " think different " might go away			1
while @entity3 , under the guidance of @entity150 , will continue to create its beautiful , crafted combination of hardware and software for at least another decade , that will no longer be enough to continue to take the risks they need to in order to wow the world the way they have since @entity67 showed us the @entity141 11 years ago			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			2

@entity164 : the new @entity5 app on @entity142 is clearly worse than the old one
@entity168 : maps is an obvious misstep , but it is n't the only one @entity3 has made recently
he says incremental steps can not substitute for boldness , like the creation of the @entity141
@entity168 : @entity3 's real problem is that its ability to " think different " might go away
