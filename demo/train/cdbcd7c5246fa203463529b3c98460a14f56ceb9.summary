it is an old @entity1 maxim that everyone flees from failure			0
when a big movie bellyflops at the box office -- like " @entity7 , " which has pulled in a cringe - inducing $ 62 million in the @entity9 in its first three weekends , barely a fourth of the film 's $ 250 million budget -- usually everyone involved tries to get as much distance as they can from the film , as quickly as they can get it			1
everyone 's hoping to salvage not only their careers , but their psyches as well , especially when that much blood , sweat , and treasure has been invested in a passion project that 's become a media punching bag			0
apparently , no one told @entity29 this is how he 's supposed to behave			1
when @entity32 caught up with the actor a few hours before he was embarking on his global press tour for " battleship " -- his second effects - laden big budget studio picture this year -- the 30 - year - old said he had " absolutely no regrets " about his first big screen starring role			1
" i would do ' @entity7 ' again tomorrow , " he says forthrightly			1
" i 'm very proud of ' @entity7			1
' box office does n't validate me as a person , or as an actor			0
" @entity29 understands that the sci - fi adventure 's financial failings -- while it 's pulled in over $ 230 million worldwide , @entity45 still expects to lose $ 200 million on the film -- are clearly " unfortunate , " if for no other reason than it 's a virtual certainty that director @entity51 's planned two sequels will never see a greenlight			1
" i 'd love to go do ' @entity7 2 , ' " he says			2
it 's just s * * * ty i do n't get to work with the [ ' @entity7 ' ] family			2
it really was a special thing			0
" but @entity29 is n't dwelling on the past			2
" i 'm going to keep working , " he says			0
@entity29 points out that after @entity35 , he 's got @entity59 's " @entity58 " coming out in july , and then he 'll likely start shooting the @entity61 drama " @entity62 " for " @entity35 " director @entity63 in the fall			2
" it 's an exciting time , " he says , and he clearly means it			0
