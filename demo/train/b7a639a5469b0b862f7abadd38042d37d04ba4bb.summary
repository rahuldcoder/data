@entity9 bowed out of the @entity6 after suffering one of her worst career defeats			2
@entity9 was thrashed 6 - 0 6 - 2 by @entity14 's @entity13 in her last - eight match on tuesday while fellow @entity16 @entity1 overcame 19 - year - old @entity4 1 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 2			1
it could have worse for former world number one @entity9 as @entity13 had a match point to mark her first @entity21 quarterfinal by dishing out the dreaded double bagel			1
@entity9 survived and she saved three more match points in the 12th game of the second set before her resistance crumbled completely with a netted forehand			0
it was her heaviest loss since she went down 6 - 1 6 - 1 to @entity29 in the fourth round in @entity31 in 2007			2
@entity9 , playing only her second tournament since a 10 - month lay - off because of a shoulder injury , was bidding to reach her second semifinal following a run to the 2007 last four			0
the @entity16 star , whose ranking slumped to 104 in the world during her time off the tour , had won both her previous matches against the pint - sized , 20 - year - old @entity13 and both were on clay			2
but @entity13 was in complete control , breaking in the first , third and fifth games of the opening set			0
the @entity47 was then quickly 1 - 0 ahead before receiving a code violation for taking too long between points			1
it did not throw her off her stride and she was soon flat out on the dirt surface of court @entity54 in celebration			0
@entity1 was given the runaround in the first set and was at one stage being held at 4 - 4 in the second , but recovered her poise on @entity63 court			1
ninth seed @entity4 had beaten @entity1 at @entity65 earlier this year and had also won three titles in 2009 , in @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity31			2
she played an almost perfect first set in just 23 minutes , but @entity1 then found the form that had seen her lose just five games in her run to the quarters opening a 4 - 1 lead in the second			1
@entity4 fought back to make it 4 - 4 but @entity1 rallied again to take the set -- and break in the opening game of the third			1
world number one @entity1 , who has yet to win a grand slam , finished the stronger to wrap up victory in an hour and 52 minutes			0
