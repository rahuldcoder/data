-- each day more than 55 million students attend the country 's 130,000 schools			2
each day , parents and guardians entrust some 7 million teachers with the education of our children			1
and on a normal day , that is all we expect teachers to do -- teach			1
but on those not - so normal days we are reminded that for six hours a day and more , five days a week , teaching is not the only thing teachers are charged with doing			1
on those not - so - normal days , we are reminded that teachers are also asked to be surrogate parents , protectors , heroes			1
monday was one of those not - so - normal days			2
the nation watched in horror as a 2 - mile - wide tornado with winds up to 200 mph tore through @entity24 , @entity25			1
as sirens blared and the ground shook , the full force of the twister hit @entity30 around 3 p.m. it was full of students , young scared children who had nowhere to hide as the tornado ripped off the roof , sending debris everywhere			2
heroes or just doing their jobs ? teacher save lives during tornado " we had to pull a car out of the front hall off a teacher and i do n't know what her name is , but she had three little kids underneath her , " a rescuer said			1
" and that teacher was not the only one whose body shielded children from harm			1
a couple of years ago , as state and local officials were looking for ways to cut spending , a study from the @entity58 emerged in 2011 , asking a provocative question : are teachers overpaid ? using abbreviated metrics -- such as comparing private sector employees ' sat and @entity70 scores with those of teachers -- the study 's co-author @entity75 said the findings suggested that " years of education could be an overestimate of cognitive skills			1
" a counterintuitive and insulting proposition			0
but in retrospect that should n't be too surprising considering @entity84 's doctoral dissertation advocated keeping out immigrants with low @entity86 , which he maintained are lower than those of the " native white population			0
" he also co-authored an attack on immigration reform for the @entity75			0
and he resigned as the group 's senior policy analyst shortly afterward			0
nevertheless , as educators in @entity98 voted to strike and benefits such as tenure came under scrutiny , the question that study proposed sparked a national conversation and helped turn 2012 into a year in which teacher - bashing became a popular past time			1
but when i think of the importance of teaching in this country , when i think about the heroism demonstrated in @entity25 , i find it impossible to overpay teachers			1
we can certainly talk about the realities of the economy , debate the best method to evaluate effectiveness and discuss the drawbacks of unions			0
but anyone who characterizes teachers as overpaid is forgetting what we entrust them with each and every day			1
inside a tornado - ravaged school on a normal day , you do n't think about that too much			1
but on a not - so - normal day , that is all you can think about			1
@entity130 , a mother of four , died trying to protect 6 - year - old @entity131 as @entity132 terrorized the halls of @entity131 in december			0
when police found the two victims , @entity130 was still holding @entity136 in her arms			0
and five other educators did not run away from the threat but gave their lives trying to protect students , trying to protect children			0
how do you overpay for that ? obviously no parent or guardian drops their children off at school thinking tragedy is going to happen			2
but perhaps we should be grateful that if something terrible does happen , that there are these angels in the building who will do right by our kids			2
who will give anything -- sometimes even their lives -- to protect them in our absence			0
one of the @entity163 teachers reportedly was lying on top of six students in a school bathroom to shelter them from the horrific storm			0
i 'm sure that is not in the job description			0
so yes , it is fiscally responsible for a community to talk about loss of tax revenue and budget deficits			0
but we ought to be careful not to vilify this profession while doing so			0
teachers are not glorified babysitters with summers off			0
their profession fuels all others , and on a normal day that is amazing enough in and of itself			1
but on a day that 's not so normal , we hope and pray that they are willing to do much more			2
and time and time again , in the face of terrible tragedies , we have learned that many of them do			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			2

@entity193 : @entity25 tornado another case where teachers tried to shield kids from harm
@entity200 : a report saying teachers are overpaid , union problems led to a lot of teacher bashing
@entity200 : how could you overpay a teacher who risks or loses her life to shield kids ?
we should not vilify teachers , he says . even on a normal day , what they do is amazing enough
