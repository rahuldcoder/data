-- the growing push to restrict the collective bargaining rights of government employees has reached the far - flung state of @entity5			1
there , a @entity7 state lawmaker has introduced legislation that would strip many public employees of the right to collectively bargain for hours , benefits and working conditions			2
state employees could still collectively bargain for wages under the legislation			0
the bill exempts firefighters , police officers and emergency medical technicians , who , according to @entity20 of the @entity21 , are prohibited from going on strike			0
the bill 's sponsor , state representative @entity24 , @entity25 , said his legislation mimics a measure that was passed by the @entity30 earlier this month , signed into law and is now the subject of a lawsuit			1
" it is the @entity30 arrangement , " @entity24 told @entity0			1
@entity24 said that his bill , like the @entity30 measure , is aimed at curbing state costs			1
similar bills to limit collective bargaining rights also are pending in @entity41 and @entity42			1
opponents of the bill give the measure little chance of passing this session			1
that 's because the 2011 session of the @entity49 is roughly two - thirds over , they said			1
also , opponents said , @entity5 lawmakers have been focused on controversial legislation to roll back the state 's oil and gas tax on profits earned by petroleum companies in the state			1
@entity24 said he does n't necessarily disagree that his bill probably wo n't pass this year			2
" this is such a union state , " @entity24 said			0
" but if you just decide that it does n't have a chance that guarantees the public will never know about it			0
you have to build , build , build and ultimately if you do enough building , you 'll end up with a house			0
" @entity67 minority leader @entity66 , @entity68 , said @entity24 's bill " would be a particularly onerous thing to drop on state employees			2
" @entity66 said public employees are still smarting from a 2005 overhaul of the state 's retirement , pension and health care system			0
@entity66 called the switch " a disaster " in a state that has a difficult time retaining qualified teachers and police officers			0
" i can not tell you how wrong she is , " @entity24 said			0
" we have teachers lined up to teach here because we pay a decent wage			0
" @entity24 agreed with @entity66 that the bill would face tough sledding in the @entity90 , where , unlike the @entity93 - controlled @entity67 , the balance of power between @entity7 and @entity92 is evenly divided			1
@entity66 , nevertheless , said the @entity92 minority leadership is taking the bill seriously			0
@entity24 said he thinks he can get his bill to the @entity67 floor for a vote and and that , if it gets that far , the measure could get passed out of the chamber			2
because the 2011 session is the first year of a two - year session for the @entity49 , the bill would not have to be reintroduced in 2012			2
state representative @entity104 , @entity105 , who is the @entity67 minority whip , wondered whether the proposed collective bargaining bill for @entity5 public employees could spark as fierce an argument as @entity30 's , which prompted 14 @entity92 to leave the state in an unsuccessful effort to kill that bill			1
" if the @entity92 flee here , " @entity104 said , " we 'll have to go to @entity113			0

new : @entity93 lawmaker says his collective bargaining bill faces tough sledding
the legislator said his bill mimics @entity30 measure
opponents say there 's not enough time in the legislative session to pass the bill
