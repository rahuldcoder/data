-- things are looking up for entrepreneurs in the @entity3 as a new breed of crowdfunding is emerging to help bring life to innovative ideas from the region			1
based on popular @entity11 sites like @entity12 and @entity13 they aim to connect everyone , from engineers in @entity16 to creatives in @entity18 , with a new way of funding			1
@entity21 is one such site that allows someone to post a " project " like an album , a book or an invention , which the public can then pledge money to			1
each project must fit into one of the platform 's categories and be accompanied by a video , a biography of the project owner and a series of " gifts " to incentivize potential backers to pledge money			1
in line with regional sensitivities , banned projects include anything to do with alcohol , politics , violence , religion and pornography			2
@entity49 , 21 , is the platform 's founder who has been involved with tech start - ups since he was 16			1
" there are many projects in the @entity55 world that do n't have the right connections ( to ) fund them , " said @entity49			0
" we are trying to market these projects through strategic partnerships			1
" currently entrepreneurs from 22 countries across the @entity3 and @entity62 can post a project on the site			0
projects include an album launch , a documentary and a new take on the toothbrush			0
globally , crowdfunding is seeing explosive growth			1
in 2012 , the market grew 81 % to $ 2.7 billion , according industry researchers @entity73			1
but in the @entity3 the concept is only just catching on			0
a lack of financial support and , crucially , mentorship is something that @entity49 believes is holding back creative projects and nascent start - ups in the region			0
for @entity83 , ceo of @entity85 , and one of four venture capital funders behind @entity88 , the true potential of @entity55 crowdfunding is the connections and exposure it provides			1
" there is definitely a funding gap , but that 's not the biggest gap			1
access to early - stage money is actually now increasing in the @entity3			0
" this kind of platform for the @entity3 is something that will push the ecosystem of innovators forward , " he added			2
" it will help democratise creativity			0
" @entity49 believes the key to making this happen is education and outreach because some " creative communities are not very tech savvy ... and they do n't know about the opportunity they can have from crowdfunding			2
" another crowdfunding platform to emerge in the region is @entity118 - based @entity117			2
a non-profit social enterprise , it aims to link up low - tech manufacturers -- who , in @entity16 , are often slum - dwellers -- with artists , scientists , engineers and product designers who can help them innovate in their businesses			0
once a prototype of a new product has been made , it can be posted on the site , allowing customers to pre-order			0
@entity134 , 49 , is a potter @entity136 has helped			1
seven years ago , @entity134 who crafts everything from pots and bowls to decorative earthenware , moved to using cheaper fiberglass instead of clay to make food and water coolers			0
studies have shown that inhaling fiberglass can cause lung problems , according to the @entity147			0
@entity136 connected @entity134 with an artist and a physicist to design an eco-friendly clay cooler for food and drinks			1
the new design , based on an ancient water cooler known as a " qolah " made with an innovative clay mix , can cool water in 12 hours in summer and two in winter			0
@entity159 has sold his new product on @entity117			0
" i always worked on clay since ( i was ) 12 years old , but lately given the drop in demand , i shifted to fiberglass			0
" the designers brought by @entity136 have shown me new designs and i was convinced to try ( them )			1
hopefully , they will bring back the clay industry to the market , " he said			2
the platform was set up in 2012 by @entity171 , 24 , with funding from the @entity173			2
according to @entity175 , basic manufacturing makes up almost 90 % of the @entity171 market , and is increasingly under pressure from other manufacturing bases , especially in @entity179			2
" we try to work on this link from the open innovation part of the website ( to the crowdfunding part ) ... to try to market innovative products that are coming from @entity171 minds , " he said			1
@entity136 is a politically neutral organization , says @entity175 , but the security situation after the recent military coup that removed @entity191 as @entity16 's president did paralyze work			1
" we hope the month of @entity194 ( the annual month of fasting and prayer for @entity197 ) will bring all the disputing parties together from their narrow political interests and focus on the nationwide interest of the people and the economy , " he said			0
" this is what really matters			0
