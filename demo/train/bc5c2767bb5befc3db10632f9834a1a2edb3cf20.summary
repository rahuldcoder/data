-- in many ways , @entity1 makes for an unassuming rebel			0
his mission is seemingly innocuous			0
he merely wants to educate the swarms of college - aged @entity7 refugees who have been forced to abandon their studies while fleeing @entity7			1
" the universities in @entity7 are basically like prisons for students , " says @entity1			1
" they capture or arrest anyone who opposes the regime			0
on the other hand , universities outside the country often do n't accept @entity7 students , or the students ca n't pay the fees or speak the local language			1
" to some , it may seem like access to higher education is hardly a priority for the 2.5 million refugees that have fled @entity7 since the conflict started three years ago			1
to @entity1 and his fellow academics , however , it is a seminal component in one day rebuilding a broken country			1
" if ( the students who left their studies ) come back to @entity7 ignorant and illiterate , they wo n't be able to help their country , " he says			1
a former law professor from @entity38 , @entity1 joined other faculty ousted from the ravaged country to start offering lectures to students in liberated regions inside @entity7 , and in neighboring countries			1
in 2013 , he set up the @entity45 , an academic institution housed in an apartment building in @entity47 , a @entity48 town near the @entity7 border			1
it offers 13 majors , including law , psychology and business			0
the university is mainly funded by @entity1 himself , and a host of academic volunteers donating their time and expertise to the cause ( @entity1 gives them a one - time payment of $ 1,500 when they sign up )			1
any student with the means contributes $ 280 per semester for their education			1
" the amount is mainly symbolic , " admits @entity1			0
" it barely covers 10 % of expenses			0
" it 's difficult to discern how many @entity7 have had to abandon their studies since the conflict started , though , according to @entity74 , an associate professor at the @entity75 , and the co-author of a study on @entity7 's refugee university students in @entity79 , the number likely exceeds 100,000			1
" our major concern is that the longer this conflict goes on , the more you 're creating a lost generation of college students , " he says			2
' studying is holy ' today , @entity7 's universities -- like many of the country 's social institutions -- are , essentially , collapsing			1
@entity74 estimates they 're operating at 50 % capacity , hampered by security issues , fleeing faculty , and broken - down infrastructure			2
often , he notes , students have to cross battle lines just to attend classes			2
male students -- who were once exempt from military service -- are now pressured into it			2
for those reasons , there is little impetus for those inside the country to continue their schooling			0
it 's a marked change from how education was treated in recent decades			2
" i think something that is often lost on people who are only coming to think about @entity115 post-conflict is how important education was as a place where different minorities and genders mixed			2
@entity7 was a place in which education could be accessed by anyone who received the requisite score on an exam , " says @entity120 , a human rights consultant and co-author of @entity74 's study			1
" there 's long been a deep commitment to education , and it 's not just window dressing			2
historically providing educational access was considered one of the things the @entity136 did really well			0
" for those students forced to give up their schooling , their commitment to higher learning has n't diminished , even if their opportunities to pursue it have			2
on a research trip to @entity145 refugee camp in @entity79 last april , @entity74 recalls meeting a group of female engineering students who smuggled their computers out of the country			2
" we asked them how supportive their parents were , and if they would let them go abroad to study			0
one woman said , ' in our house , studying is holy			0
' " overcoming obstacles ? the challenges facing those who want to continue their education are fierce			0
" they range from the prosaic , like not having a transcript , or maybe just having a photocopied one , to the substantive , like having to choose between tuition and taking care of family , " says @entity74			0
neighboring countries do n't always make it easy			0
@entity79 , for instance , is hostile to refugee institutions that risk becoming permanent			0
in @entity48 , there 's the added barrier of language			0
on top of everything else , space is limited , both at foreign universities , and at the @entity45 , which can accommodate little more than 800 students -- a fact that keeps @entity1 awake at night			0
" i regret that i 'm not able to accept the whole @entity7 student body , but we do n't have the capabilities			1
we could only do that if we had more funding , " he says			0
furthermore , the refugee population , of both students and faculty , is disparate , with many still stuck in @entity7			1
to remedy this , @entity1 offers lessons via @entity193 , @entity194 and email			0
interestingly , many of @entity7 's fragmented student population seem to have a singular focus , according to @entity120 : returning home one day			1
she says this is evidenced by the fact that courses at the @entity45 are taught in @entity202 , not @entity48			0
she also cites the fact that several thousand @entity7 refugees in opposition - held areas of @entity7 and in neighboring countries rallied to take the high school exit exams based on the revised 2011 @entity7 curriculum			1
according to @entity120 , several hundred students chose to take the exit exams recognized by the @entity7 opposition government in exile in @entity214			1
" the primary reason to sit for @entity7 exams outside of @entity7 is because you think you can go back and use them there , especially when it is not clear who outside of @entity7 will recognize the results , " says @entity120			1
watch : @entity224 refugees plant their own vegetables			0

by some estimates , 100,000 @entity7 have had to abandon university
*analysts* say education will be the *key* to rebuilding @entity7
students in @entity7 risk *harassment* , jail time and death to go to school
a new institution run by academics in exile hopes to save @entity7 through education
