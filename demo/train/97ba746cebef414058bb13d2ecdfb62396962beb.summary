@entity0 , @entity1 -- there 's an innocence to @entity6 , she says			1
the actress , who has starred in " @entity8 " and " @entity16 , " wanted to tap into her childlike side for " @entity10 , " a new animated film about an @entity13 astronaut who lands on a faraway planet that has much in common with 1950s @entity15 -- except for the aliens			1
" i love that kind of throwback to a more of innocent time and a simpler time and more conservative , " she told @entity2			0
" there 's something just kind of attractive about that , those kinds of qualities to me , and i just thought it would be fun			2
" " @entity10 , " which also features the voice work of @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , opens friday			1
@entity6 sat down with @entity2 to talk about the film , the challenges of voice work and the difficulty of finding good roles for actresses			1
the following is an edited version of the interview			0
@entity2 : why did you choose to do something animated ? @entity6 : i think i chose this part because i 'm kind of a kid at heart and i really thought the story was so sweet and fun			1
... i was n't doing anything			0
i was able to work in town , at home in @entity0 , which is so rare			0
@entity2 : you could probably wear your pajamas to work			0
roll in , no hair and makeup			0
i just always wanted to be a voice in some great movie where some little girl loves my character			1
@entity2 : did you get to meet [ your co-stars ] when you were doing the voices ? @entity6 : i never saw them , never met them			1
i mean , i know @entity30 , i 've known @entity30 for a long time			0
i met @entity31 before , but i never saw them once			0
it was such an interesting experience to be there by yourself kind of going through it			0
but ... it goes fast			0
you 're there , it 's fast , it 's fun			2
@entity2 : who 's your character ? @entity6 : i play @entity80 , who is this lovely 16 - year - old girl			1
... she 's insecure about boys but also has a sense of confidence for herself , very independent , and is not listening to what the government is saying about this alien [ the @entity89 ] who 's landed on her planet			2
she is standing up on her own two feet , thinking for herself			0
... so she 's , you know , she 's trying to find out who she is as a woman			1
@entity2 : you do have a strong female character and it 's such a good role model for young girls			2
is it hard to find that in films today ? @entity6 : it is			1
i mean , honestly , it 's just rare to find a story about a woman 's experience , about a young girl 's experience			2
for some reason nobody wants to make those movies			0
and it 's really hard because there are so many talented women and there are not enough projects for everybody to really blossom and explore			1
so it 's quite competitive because there 's a small amount of material			2
@entity2 : is it hard for @entity125 to write those kinds of roles ? @entity6 : i do n't know what it is			1
i 'm still trying to decipher that .			0
