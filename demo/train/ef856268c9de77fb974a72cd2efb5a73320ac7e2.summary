-- @entity2 fans holding out hope they 'd see the company 's next great gadget on monday were disappointed			1
at the keynote address for the company 's annual @entity8 , software was king			0
for owners of the 800 million iphones , @entity14 and ipods that run the company 's @entity17 operating system , the biggest news may have been the rollout of its latest version , @entity21 8			1
due to be released this fall , the new system will update lots of existing features and add some new ones			1
so , here 's a first look at eight key features of @entity17			2
health @entity2 has been pushing fitness and health apps , such as the one associated with @entity33 's @entity32			1
with @entity29 , they 're taking it a step further			1
basically , @entity29 pulls together data from different health - related apps into one place , creating a comprehensive profile for the user			1
it also lets the users send health information to doctors at selected hospitals			0
it 's easy to see this being a prominent feature when ( and if ) the long - rumored @entity49 arrives , which could include sensors that track the wearer 's steps , heartbeat and other vital signs			2
@entity55 even if it 's not the expansive home - automation system that some rumors suggested , @entity55 is a step toward turning your smartphone into a remote control for the connected devices in your home			1
@entity2 has partnered with lots of third - party folks ( but notably not @entity66 , founded by former @entity2 designer @entity67 and recently purchased by @entity68 ) on the app. by pulling all of those apps ' abilities together in one place , @entity55 will let users control their garage doors , locks , lights , cameras and thermostats with their phone			1
obviously , some third - party hardware will be required -- at least for now			0
new tricks for @entity82 the @entity84 's famous voice assistant , @entity82 , only got a quick mention monday			1
but she 's learned a couple of new tricks			0
on @entity17 , users who plug their @entity84 into their car will be able to wake @entity82 up by voice without having to touch their phone			1
less distraction on the road sounds like a good thing to us			0
and you 'll be able to ask @entity82 to identify the song you 're listening to , using technology from the @entity100 app. ' @entity101 ' in messages this is a simple little feature , but tons of folks following our live blog of the @entity2 event seemed to really like this one			1
in messages , " @entity113 " will let you mute conversation threads that you 're a part of without having to leave them entirely			0
so , if your buddies are nailing down that karaoke outing while you 're at work , you can make them hush -- while leaving other threads active -- and come back to the chat later			0
@entity119 @entity68 may be the tech giant most associated with predictive text , but @entity2 's giving it a go with @entity122			1
the keyboard feature presumably will make sending messages quicker by guessing what you 're writing before you finish writing it , letting you tap and move on to the next word			0
phones on @entity130 already have this			0
but @entity2 promises that @entity119 will learn your language habits , including how you text in different message threads			1
so for example , it may predict one word in a work - related thread ( " time for my next meeting " ) , another with your party - time buddy ( " time for my next beer " ) and a third in texts with your mom ( " time for my next visit " )			0
interactive notifications with this one , @entity2 catches up on another feature already used by @entity130 owners			2
interactive notifications let you respond to things such as text messages , @entity152 posts in which you 're tagged and appointment reminders without leaving the app you 're currently using			0
to @entity2 's credit , their version looks pretty smooth			1
it even lets you tap to reply with a voice recording , image or video without abandoning that killer level of " @entity163			0
" family sharing up to six members of a family will be able to share their @entity168 purchases across different devices , meaning you and your brother no longer have to pay $ 6.99 each for " @entity172			2
" the catch is you 'll have to use the same credit card for all those purchases			0
it 's @entity2 's way of preventing overly liberal interpretations of the word " family			2
" this new feature also will let relatives more easily share calendars , photos , reminders and the like			0
@entity185 @entity2 will now offer more storage for all your photos and videos in the cloud with access to them from any device			2
the @entity185 also will include a " smart " editing feature that lets users slide their finger to adjust multiple effects at the same time			2
for example , the app will allow you to tweak light , contrast and color on photos , with every adjustment automatically updated across all your devices .			0
