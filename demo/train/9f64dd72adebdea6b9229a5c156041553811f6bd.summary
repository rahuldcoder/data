-- the accused terrorist who said he was tortured into making a false connection between @entity4 and @entity5 has died in a @entity7 prison , human rights monitors said tuesday			1
@entity8 featured @entity10 's claim in a presentation to the @entity12			2
@entity10 's allegation that @entity5 agents trained @entity4 operatives in the use of chemical and biological weapons was " pivotal " to the @entity20 administration 's case for the 2003 invasion of @entity5 , said @entity22 , a counterterrorism adviser for the @entity24 - based @entity23			1
" he 's a fairly significant figure in the counterterrorism world , and his testimony i would say provided the linchpin for the invasion of @entity5 , " she said			2
then - secretary of state @entity8 featured @entity10 's claim in the dramatic presentation he made to the @entity12 just weeks before the invasion , citing it as evidence of ties between @entity5 dictator @entity36 's government and the terrorist network responsible for the 2001 attacks on @entity39 and @entity40			1
@entity42 recanted his account after the invasion , and no other evidence supported the story , the @entity41 reported in 2006			1
@entity42 's death was first reported by a @entity7 newspaper over the weekend and confirmed by @entity23 researchers monday , @entity22 said			1
the newspaper report said he had committed suicide , and the group is asking @entity7 to conduct a " full and transparent " investigation into his death			1
researchers from the @entity39 - based organization were " stunned " to discover him in a @entity7 prison in april during a fact - finding mission to the @entity62 country , @entity22 said			0
the @entity24 did not transfer @entity10 to the @entity64 prison camp with other top @entity4 captives in 2006 , and @entity40 had never confirmed what happened to him , she said			1
when prison officials pointed out @entity10 to the researchers , he refused to talk to the group			2
he told them , " where were you when i was being tortured in @entity24 jails ? " @entity22 said			0
" he got really angry and walked away , " she said			0
the @entity7 newspaper @entity74 reported sunday that @entity10 , born @entity75 , had committed suicide in a prison cell in his native country			1
he had been getting regular visits from his family , the last one in late march , the newspaper reported			0
" upon discovering his body , the police and a doctor were dispatched to the prison immediately to start the investigation , " @entity74 reported			0
in @entity40 , @entity88 spokesman @entity87 said the @entity24 was investigating the report , but had no immediate comment			0
" i have to refer you to the government of @entity7 for any details regarding the matter , " he said			0
@entity42 had trained @entity4 operatives in @entity96 and was captured in @entity97 in late 2001 , according to the @entity41 report			1
after the invasion of @entity5 , he said his statements connecting @entity5 to @entity4 had been made in response to threats by @entity24 interrogators and by beatings at the hands of intelligence agents in @entity107 , where he was transferred in 2002			1
" i think he would be able to tell us more about the secret @entity111 prison program and the rendition program , " @entity22 said			0
@entity42 told the @entity111 in 2004 that he had made up the story " in order to gain better treatment " and avoid being shipped to @entity107 , the @entity41 reported			2
@entity107 denies wrongdoing , but was widely believed to have tortured prisoners in its custody , according to an april report from the @entity121			0
as early as february 2002 , the @entity24 @entity122 warned that @entity10 " was likely intentionally misleading his debriefers , " the @entity41 report states			1
the @entity111 supported @entity10 's account , but added language to its january 2003 assessment noting that he would not have had first - hand knowledge of any weapons training , according to the committee			2
the @entity20 administration argued that the invasion of @entity5 was necessary because @entity5 was concealing chemical , biological and nuclear weapons programs from international inspectors and could have shared those weapons with terrorists			0
no such stockpiles were found after the invasion , and the independent commission that investigated the 2001 attacks found no evidence of a collaborative relationship between the two entities			0
@entity0 's @entity143 contributed to this report .			0
