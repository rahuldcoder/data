a police captain also testified thursday about finding two photos of a nude girl on a cell phone belonging to @entity18			1
rape allegations engulf town consent vs. non-consent the case will hinge not on consent but rather on whether @entity18 and @entity30 knew that the girl was too impaired to know what was happening the night of the alleged attacks , prosecutor @entity151 said in opening statements wednesday			1
six witnesses for the prosecution testified wednesday , saying the alleged victim appeared to be drunk : stumbling , swaying and throwing up			0

she described the girl as a " mess , " wearing her stained shirt inside - out			2
on cross-examination , @entity30 's attorney , @entity139 , asked the witness whether her view of what had happened that night had been framed by the tweets and social media posts she had seen about the victim and whether what she had seen in those messages made her angry			2
another witness , a 17 - year - old friend of @entity30 's , said on cross-examination that while the girl appeared drunk , he did not believe she was unaware of what she was doing			1
the boy also told @entity18 ' attorney , @entity195 , that he had n't seen the girl drinking and had not witnessed @entity123 involved in any sexual contact with the girl			1
