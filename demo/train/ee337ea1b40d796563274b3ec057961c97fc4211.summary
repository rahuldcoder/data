another @entity1 political showdown took shape tuesday as the @entity3 passed a @entity5 plan that would extend the payroll tax cut and speed the process for government approval of the @entity10 oil pipeline			1
the bill , approved on a 234 - 193 vote largely on party lines , now goes to the @entity14 , where it was unlikely to pass due to strong opposition from @entity18 leaders			2
and the @entity19 says president @entity20 will veto the plan if it reaches his desk , setting up further brinksmanship with @entity24 scheduled to leave @entity1 for its holiday recess at the end of the week			2
" this @entity24 needs to do its job and stop the tax hike that 's scheduled to affect 160 million @entity32 in 18 days , " @entity19 spokesman @entity27 said in a statement after the vote			1
" this is not a time for @entity1 republicans to score political points against the president			0
" the impasse involves a convergence of major issues , including the payroll tax - cut extension and a spending bill that must pass in order to keep the government funded after friday			1
@entity20 and @entity14 majority leader @entity42 , @entity43 , agreed that @entity24 must not go home for the holidays without extending the payroll tax cut that saves working @entity32 an average of $ 1,000 a year , @entity19 spokesman @entity27 told reporters			1
without spelling out a specific order of necessary steps , @entity27 made clear that @entity20 wants @entity24 to approve both a payroll tax plan and the broad government spending bill			1
@entity14 @entity5 leader @entity53 of @entity54 characterized the @entity18 stance as a threat to delay action on the spending plan until a compromise is reached on the payroll tax cut measure			1
that could cause a government shutdown after friday , @entity61 warned			0
@entity27 , however , insisted that @entity24 has plenty of time to act on all of the outstanding measures , and called for a payroll tax extension free of the pipeline provision			1
earlier , speaker @entity69 and other @entity3 @entity5 leaders told reporters that the payroll tax measure to be voted on later in the day had bipartisan support and would create jobs while also preventing a tax increase for @entity32 workers next year			1
when the vote came , 10 @entity77 joined 224 republicans voting for the bill , while 14 @entity5 joined 179 democrats voting against it			2
asked about opposition by @entity77 who say they will reject the @entity3 measure , @entity69 said : " the @entity14 will have to do whatever they have to do			2
" the pipeline , which is currently in limbo as the @entity88 considers objections from environmentalists , would bring oil from @entity93 's oil sands in northern @entity94 to @entity95			1
more on the pipeline showdown the @entity88 recently said its decision on the @entity10 would be delayed until 2013 to allow examination of environmental issues raised by critics , a move republicans labeled as political , to put off the issue until after next year 's presidential election			0
@entity3 majority leader @entity104 , @entity105 , said the payroll tax cut measure does exactly what @entity20 has been calling for by providing tax protection for working class @entity32 while creating new jobs through the pipeline project			1
rep. @entity112 , @entity113 , offered a colorful take on what will happen if @entity42 blocks the @entity3 plan , as threatened			0
" if sen. @entity42 wants to hold up the jobs bill , he will go on @entity119 's naughty list , " @entity112 said			0
@entity42 and other @entity77 argue the pipeline project requires more study and should not be fast - tracked as part of a political calculation by @entity5			2
on tuesday , @entity42 said @entity5 must compromise with @entity77 instead of trying to push through proposals intended to appease conservatives in their caucus			2
" speaker @entity69 had to add ideological candy coating to his bill to get rebellious , rank - and - file @entity5 on board , " @entity42 said , adding : " they are wasting time catering to the tea party when they should be working with @entity77 on a bipartisan package that can pass both houses			1
" the @entity3 @entity5 proposal would both change the process and shorten the time frame for the government to approve the proposed pipeline from @entity93 to @entity95			1
but monday , the @entity88 said that would make it impossible for it to complete needed environmental , national security and safety studies			0
" in the absence of properly completing the process , the department would be unable to make a determination to issue a permit for this project , " the @entity88 said in a written response to questions about the measure			0
@entity69 dismissed the @entity88 's warning later monday , saying the pipeline had been under review for three years and , " all the work has been done			0
" " the only thing arbitrary about this decision is the decision by the president to say , ' well , let 's wait until after the next election , ' " @entity69 said			0
" the @entity32 people want jobs , and this is as close to a shovel - ready project as you 're ever going to see			0
" the @entity3 @entity5 measure extends the payroll tax cut for one year and renews aid for the unemployed , while cutting back the maximum length of jobless benefits from the current 99 weeks to 59			1
the bill also allows states more flexibility in distributing unemployment assistance , permitting states to require those applying to submit to drug tests or show they are pursuing a high school degree , if they do n't have one			0
the bill would also avoid a scheduled cut in pay for @entity188 physicians for two years , a provision known as the " doc fix			0
" to pay for the bill , @entity5 leaders use a series of spending cuts , including freezing pay for federal employees and members of @entity24 , eliminating a child tax credit for those in the @entity32 illegally , and increasing @entity188 premiums for those who earn more than $ 80,000 annually			2
the pipeline issue is just one part of the problem for @entity77 who disagree with " central elements " of the @entity5 bill , including the length of the unemployment insurance extension , the proposed cost offsets and the weakening of some environmental regulations			2
@entity27 said tuesday the spending cuts go deeper than levels agreed to in august in the deal negotiated by @entity24 and the @entity19 to raise the federal debt ceiling			2
democrats led by @entity20 have been pushing for the payroll tax cut extension ; republicans initially opposed the plan but have now signed on			1
however , the parties are at loggerheads over how to pay for it as well as the political optics over who should get credit , as an election year approaches			0
as a way to garner support from reluctant conservative republicans , who voiced concerns about the impact of the payroll tax cut on @entity233 , @entity5 leaders insisted on keeping the provision aimed at moving toward approving the pipeline project within 60 days			1
@entity14 @entity77 have begun working on a new bill of their own after @entity5 blocked progress on their previous proposals that included a surtax on income over $ 1 million			1
meanwhile , in the other big bill @entity24 needs to get done before funding expires , @entity242 chairman @entity241 told reporters off the @entity3 floor monday that negotiators have worked out a deal on the year - end spending bill that wraps nine remaining bills into one package			0
the @entity54 @entity5 said there are some " policy riders " in the deal , but he declined to get into any specifics on which ones , saying he wants the staff to finish writing the legislation before he talks about any details			0
but @entity241 said it is taking some time to " cross the @entity263 's " so the bill would not be posted online monday night , which puts off the @entity3 vote to thursday at the earliest			0
@entity241 was confident the @entity3 would pass the bill , saying , " we 'll get it done by " friday			0
according to two senior @entity3 @entity5 leadership aides , @entity42 has told @entity69 he would hold up the spending bill until both sides negotiate a compromise on the payroll tax cut bill			1
asked about a potential government shutdown , @entity272 @entity271 of @entity273 said @entity24 may need to pass a short - term spending measure to prevent a shutdown if the parties fail to reach agreement on the various unresolved issues , including the extension of both the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits			1
@entity27 also said tuesday that a continuing resolution on spending is a possible short - term solution to provide more time to work out a deal on the payroll tax measure .			0

" @entity24 needs to do its job and stop the tax hike , " the @entity19 says
the bill now goes to the @entity14 , where it is unlikely to pass
@entity5 are linking the payroll tax to a *controversial* oil pipeline from @entity93 to @entity95
@entity77 accuse @entity5 of playing politics with a tax cut they *traditionally* support
