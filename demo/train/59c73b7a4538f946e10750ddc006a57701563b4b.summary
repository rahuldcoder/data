-- @entity1 considers himself the " lightning rod " for @entity3 , which has been beset by internal strife over the past several months			1
and while friday he wanted to talk about the release of @entity6 documents he said showed " compelling evidence of war crimes " committed by @entity11 - led coalition and @entity13 government forces , @entity1 faces both professional and personal challenges			1
in an exclusive interview friday with @entity0 , the @entity3 editor - in - chief dismissed reports of internal disputes within the organization , chalking them up to a small handful of disgruntled employees who had been suspended			1
@entity1 , who is being investigated by @entity23 authorities in two separate cases of rape and molestation , would not discuss its potential impact on the organization			1
since the july publication of the @entity31 , a massive , searchable database containing more than 70,000 classified documents about the @entity34 , some in the mostly secretive group of volunteers have quit , citing disagreements with the way the group conducts business and @entity1 's personality and style			1
" this organization does not let anyone hang out to dry , " @entity1 said friday			1
" we always expect tremendous criticism			0
it is my role to be the lightning rod ... to attract the attacks against the organization for our work , and that is a difficult role			1
" " on the other hand , " he said , " i get undue credit			0
" some of the attacks have come from within @entity3			1
@entity59 , a longtime volunteer and spokesman for @entity3 , quit last month			1
he told @entity0 that @entity1 's personality was distracting from the group 's original mission : to publish small leaks , not just huge , splashy ones like the @entity31			1
@entity66 ' new spokesman @entity65 said the material @entity3 publishes is far more important than the organization or @entity1 , and it has tried to convey that			1
" in the history of @entity3 , nobody has claimed that the material being put out is not authentic , " he said			1
when he left @entity3 , @entity59 said the site was flooded with new submissions from several countries that have not been published			2
" there is now more information than can be handled , " @entity59 said			0
in the past few weeks , a large number of new volunteers have joined @entity3 to replace volunteers who have left , he said			2
@entity3 may be down , he said , but it 's far from out			2
money has also been an issue			0
last week , a @entity85 company that had been collecting donations for @entity3 ended its relationship with the organization			2
examining leaks is " a very expensive process , " @entity1 said in august			2
shortly after the @entity31 leak , prosecutors in @entity23 announced that they are investigating @entity1 in two separate cases of rape and molestation			1
" there is reason to believe that a crime has been committed , " @entity96 , @entity23 's director of public prosecutions , said in a statement last month			2
" considering information available at present , my judgment is that the classification of the crime is rape			0
" she said more investigation is necessary before she can make a final decision			0
@entity1 has maintained he 's innocent and told the @entity109 television network @entity108 the accusations were a " smear campaign			2
" this week , his application for residency in @entity23 was rejected because it failed to fulfill all the requirements			0
a @entity23 immigration official declined to elaborate			0
@entity1 , who is mercurial in interviews , answered @entity0 's questions friday about strife within @entity3 , but repeatedly declined to answer questions about the rape and molestation investigation and what the allegations may mean to the organization			1
" this interview is about something else			0
i will have to walk if you are , " @entity1 said			0
" if you are going to contaminate this extremely serious interview with questions about my personal life			0
" moments later , @entity1 walked off the set in @entity132			0
" ok , sorry , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity133 contributed to this report .			0
