for 17 - year - old @entity1 , sunset brings fear			1
" people prowl around the camp at night , " she says , sitting on her straw bed in the makeshift camp she is forced to call " home			1
" refugees have been fleeing fighting between renegade militia groups in eastern @entity11			1
" when i 'm alone in my shelter at night , people come by and pull up the blanket over the door			1
they look at me , and wo n't answer when i ask who they are			1
" just four weeks ago , @entity1 was forced to flee her village in the east of the @entity11 , walking 24 hours to get to @entity22 camp , on the outskirts of @entity25 town			1
she had been raped by two rebel militia men who attacked her while she was working in the fields			1
" each one took me , " she says			2
" i stayed for one week at home , bleeding			2
then my father threw me out because he thought i was pregnant and carrying an enemy child			1
" @entity1 's story is run of the mill here			2
the pain she feels does not mark her			2
for the past two months a steady stream of adults and children has been arriving here , trying to escape the vicious fighting between renegade militia groups that seems , once again , to be engulfing parts of eastern @entity11			1
around 40,000 are now crowded into @entity22			2
another 136,000 have fled to other camps around @entity25 and into @entity44 , and the numbers are continuing to rise			1
the all - too - familiar cycles of destruction , rape and violence that have plagued this vast country for the past ten years , leaving more than four million dead , seem to have returned			1
in september last year , to much fanfare , the country held its first democratic elections			1
observers hoped that for the first time , @entity11 's history of bad government and rebellious factions could be put to rest			1
but for those living in the still - lawless east , there has been no such relief			1
" many of us have never re-found life , " says @entity63 , the secretary of @entity65 camp , five minutes drive from @entity22			1
" people are suffering terribly			2
the soldiers come and burn our houses , separate families and kill			1
it is getting worse and it is very frightening " he stands behind a battered table - there are no chairs - in a small hut he uses as the camp 's headquarters			2
" it 's not safe for us here			2
we 've had cases of cholera , dysentery , and there 's no medical centre			2
the facilities here are terrible			2
this camp has been here for five months and it was only last week that we got a water pump			2
" even basic shelter is still a problem for the 16,000 living here			2
" two - thirds of the families still do n't have plastic sheeting to protect them from the cold and the rain , " says @entity63			0
" and there are n't enough clothes			0
we try to protect the children , but it 's difficult , especially when they 're going out into the village to try to earn money			0
they are being exploited inside and outside the camp			0
it 's very frustrating not to be able to act			0
" a straw pole among the kids at the water pump affirms @entity115 worries			0
" look at me , i 'm dirty , " confides eight - year old @entity116 , a square - shouldered little boy wearing a filthy grey t - shirt			0
" we get wet when it rains , " adds 12 - year - old @entity119 , who lives , as do most in the camp , under a cramped shelter made of branches and banana leaves			0
" and we 're just hungry			0
we have to start our life every day without eating or drinking			1
" the biggest complaint , however , is boredom			0
" we do n't do anything , " says nine - year - old @entity129 , chewing a piece of plastic			0
" we want to go to school , we want school desks and books and uniforms			0
but there is nothing for us			0
" @entity139 is a social worker with aid organisation @entity140 , which is working with children in the camps around @entity25			1
" we help look after children who have been separated from their families , listening to their stories , helping them to get medical care , trying to trace their parents , " she says			0
" sometimes you ca n't believe the stories you are hearing			0
these children have gone through so much			0
many of the children we are working with have been forced to fight as soldiers , both boys and girls			1
they are captured in their villages by militia , tied up and sent to kill on the front line			1
" she breaks off to talk to a teenage boy who has arrived at the tent door , clearly ill , his face running with sweat			0
when she returns , she continues			1
" after more than ten years of fighting it feels like the country is on the brink again , and it ca n't be allowed to happen			1
the international community has a responsibility here , to make sure all the military leaders come together to find a peaceable solution			0
" she waves her arm towards the door			0
" these kids are desperate to be at home with their families , going to school , and to be responsible for their own lives			0
they tell me they want to be pilots , doctors , even drivers with big cars			0
if steps are n't taken now to calm this conflict , they 're going to be the biggest victims			0
" all the names of the children in this article have been changed to protect them from persecution			0

fighting continues between militia groups in eastern @entity196 of @entity11
life in refugee camps in the east of the country is harsh and *dangerous*
a *generation* of child soldiers is growing up among violence
