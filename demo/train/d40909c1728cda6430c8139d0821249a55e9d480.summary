-- the @entity3 will not conduct a civil rights investigation in the case of a teenager found dead in a rolled - up mat at his southern @entity9 high school , a spokesperson for that agency said wednesday			1
@entity10 , 17 , was discovered dead last january 11 headfirst in a rolled wrestling mat in the @entity13 gymnasium in @entity14 , @entity9			1
the @entity3 's criminal division is aware of concerns about @entity10 's death , but after reviewing the investigative file , it determined there is not " sufficient indication of a civil rights violation to authorize a civil rights investigation , " according to the agency 's spokesperson			1
" we have discussed this matter with @entity27 attorney @entity26 , and his office is continuing to monitor and evaluate this matter , including the second autopsy report , " the spokesperson added , referring to @entity27 attorney @entity26 whose jurisdiction includes @entity14			0
that second autopsy report , which was obtained by @entity0 on tuesday , found that @entity10 died as the result of " unexplained , apparent non-accidental , blunt force trauma			1
" this report directly contradicts an autopsy conducted by the @entity39 that determined that @entity10 's death was the result of positional asphyxia			1
the @entity43 ruled that his death was accidental			2
questioning that cause of death , @entity10 's family sent copies of the second autopsy report to the @entity39 , the @entity27			1
attorney for @entity9 's @entity52 and @entity53 -- as well as the @entity3 's criminal division -- for review			2
" i want to do the right thing by the people and the county and all concerned ; i 'm just not sure we have enough information , " @entity13 coroner @entity60 said earlier this week			0
" i 'm not about to refute anybody 's findings because i 'm not a doctor			0
" on may 1 , a judge granted the @entity68 ' request to exhume their son 's body in order to conduct -- at their expense -- the independent autopsy			0
that autopsy , done on june 15 , found @entity10 had suffered blunt force trauma to the right neck and soft tissues " consistent with inflicted injury			1
" " this is unexplained -- most very , very likely inflicted , as opposed to something he caused himself , inflicted by another -- and therefore needs to be investigated as an open homicide investigation , " said dr. @entity80 with @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity83 , who conducted the autopsy			0
he characterized authorities failure to pursue the case as " mystifying			0
" the initial patient care report , written by @entity94 with he @entity95 on the day @entity10 was found , pointed to " bruising ( on ) the right side jaw			2
" yet a january 25 report from the @entity14 - @entity99 cited " no signs of blunt force trauma on @entity10 's face or body			2
" the autopsy results released may 2 by the @entity39 identified " no significant injuries			1
" speaking earlier this week , @entity26 said his office has been working on @entity10 's case " for some time , " though it had not launched a formal investigation			0
" there are some members of the community that question the result , " @entity26 said			0
" i want to make sure members of the community and the family and everyone involved has confidence in my work and my decision			0

@entity10 , 17 , was found dead in a rolled - up gym mat at his @entity9 high school
authorities ruled his death accidental , said he did **n't** have " significant injuries " before dying
the family questioned the ruling , ordering an autopsy that found " non-accidental *...* trauma "
@entity3 does **n't** find " sufficient indication of a civil rights violation "
