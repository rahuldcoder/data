this week , house speaker @entity0 announced that the @entity1 will not consider immigration reform this year			1
despite growing numbers and increasing political influence of the nation 's @entity7 population , the @entity1 leadership has chosen to show it disrespect			2
here is some context : last year , 409,849 human beings -- mothers , fathers , sons and daughters -- were torn from their families and deported			0
millions have been exploited , forced to live in unrelenting fear of workplace raids and criminalized as they seek a fair pathway to citizenship			2
an entire generation of immigrants , the majority of whom are immigrants of color , are relegated to second - class status			1
sadly , many of the same corporations that build the country 's correctional facilities also build and run prison - like immigrant detention facilities			0
since the @entity33 and @entity34 of 1996 , which cuts off long - standing policies of pardoning eligible immigrants who were at one point undocumented , and since 9/11 , even the path to legality and recognition as human beings with equal rights has become an illusion			1
the breakdown of our democratic values does not end there			0
the path to equal representation in our democracy — our fundamental right to vote — must also be urgently addressed			2
on june 25 , the @entity50 struck down the formula of the @entity52 needed for the federal government to protect rights in states with long histories of discrimination			0
just two hours after the decision , @entity58 announced it would reinstate its strict voter id law			0
this law had already been struck down by the @entity62 as discriminatory against @entity63 and @entity64 -- groups significantly less likely to have the limited forms of government - issued photo id required under the law			0
@entity70 has followed suit by purging its voting rolls , ensnaring former immigrants who are now citizens despite the lack of measurable non-citizen voter fraud			2
under the purge procedure , @entity70 's immigrant communities may be at risk of getting hit with letters questioning their citizenship status , hearing dates , requirements to show their papers and the costs of replacing lost documents			0
the state renewed this intimidating attempt to scare off communities of naturalized citizens , despite having settled a discrimination claim brought over a similar purge in 2012 by @entity92 , @entity93 , other national voting rights groups , and @entity70 - based @entity7 and @entity97 @entity96 community groups			1
in state after state across the country , voter id and other " show me your papers to vote " laws , laws that disparately impact immigrants of color , are being pursued at an alarming rate			1
given our nation 's long history of racial discrimination , it is perhaps not surprising that there is a great backlash against inclusion and equality as the face of our nation changes and the immigrant population grows dramatically			0
restrictions on voting rights based on race have been going on since formerly enslaved black @entity64 first became " citizens " and eligible to vote			1
but disenfranchisement is not the @entity96 way			0
true democracy is impossible if millions have no road map to become citizens , and if those who are citizens have their voting rights challenged at every turn			1
for a true and just democracy , we must dismantle any ethnic and racial barriers to citizenship and voting rights			1
only when each person , regardless of race or ethnicity , is allowed to equally participate will our fundamental notions of citizenship and democracy -- and indeed , the @entity138 -- be realized .			2

@entity146 : @entity0 says @entity1 wo *n't* take up immigration reform
she says this is shameful ; a generation of immigrants live in *shadows*
promise of equal rights also hurt by @entity158 laws that tend to target *people* of color , she says
*writer* : for a just democracy , we must dismantle racial barriers to citizenship and voting rights
