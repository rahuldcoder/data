-- at six foot five , with his shock of blonde hair shaved into a fat @entity4 and talking in a languid @entity6 drawl , @entity1 looks like he was once part of an all - conquering college basketball team			1
but the 26 - year - old @entity9 does n't play basketball			1
or at least not well			0
" i played recreational basketball for one season , " he told @entity0			0
" people told me i should try it because of my height			0
but i was n't any good at it			0
" instead life had a different path for @entity1 , one that would take him far from his native @entity21 , @entity22			1
on sunday he will line up as a defender for the @entity25 national soccer team as they take on @entity27 in a match that , just one year on from the @entity30 final in @entity31 , represents one of the first steps towards qualification for the next tournament in @entity36 in 2014			1
besides being @entity39 's first @entity30 match on home soil , sunday 's encounter will have extra significance for @entity1			1
it will be the first time he has ever set foot in the @entity45 and he plans to visit his ancestral town of @entity47			1
his team traveled for 24 hours to be able to play their first match against @entity27			1
the game was moved from @entity51 to the tiny aluminum smelting town of @entity53 in southern @entity54 -- a few miles from the @entity55 and @entity27 border -- for fear of violence in @entity27			1
@entity39 won 2 - 0 and now have a good chance of qualifying for the second round where they would play @entity62			1
the return match , to be held sunday in @entity64 , will also be a landmark : @entity39 's first ever @entity30 match on home soil			1
" my dad taught me to play the game			0
he would always take me and my brother out and we would always play around the back yard , " @entity1 says			1
" i kicked football in high school , and i was actually pretty good at it			0
they wanted me to pursue it in college but i did n't really want to			0
i wanted to play with a team , i really wanted to play soccer			1
" @entity1 's remarkable story began in @entity82			1
along with his sister , his @entity9 mother and @entity25 father , he fled the country in 1990 when @entity88 's forces invaded the kingdom and sparked the first @entity90			1
" i remember bombs going off			0
missiles shooting off near the apartment			0
i remember grabbing my bear , me and my sister running to my dad 's bedroom and saying : ' what 's going on ? ' " he recalled			2
" the next morning my dad would come in shaking from the bombs going off			0
because we are @entity9 , my mom managed to get the entire family in to the @entity9 we left everything behind			1
" growing up , @entity1 soon discovered his love for soccer , playing for @entity109 , the same youth team that nurtured @entity9 internationals @entity110 and @entity112			1
his @entity114 heritage was seldom an issue , he says , but he noticed a change after 9/11			1
" by looking at me , i look like a white boy , " he laughed			0
" you do n't get judged immediately like my father does			0
he gets judged right away			0
but you look at me and you do n't think i 'm @entity114			2
" before 9/11 there were no problems , really			0
i had always established myself as an @entity9 from the @entity122			2
after 9/11 it was very difficult			0
my dad would tell me : ' be careful what you say			0
' i would get double , tripled - checked at the airport			2
you know it 's for safety for the country , so i do n't have many complaints about it			2
" after stints playing for the @entity134 , @entity135 and then in the @entity137 league , @entity1 returned to the @entity9 and joined @entity138 in @entity9 's second tier league			1
but by now he had become an international footballer			0
a scout from the @entity142 discovered him while on a tour looking for professional players from the @entity25 diaspora that might qualify to play for the national team			1
" at the time , when i thought of the national team i thought i could play for the @entity9 national team at some point but i never really got the opportunity , so i took this one			1
i really had no idea i 'd be in the @entity25 national team , " he said			1
" i knew it was n't going to be the best set - up , i knew it would n't be particularly professional			2
but i could do my part			0
i did n't know what i could do for the @entity25 people apart from play football			0
so when they told me i could play for the @entity25 national team i said yes			1
" many will be surprised that @entity39 even has a national team			1
in 1998 @entity164 , world football 's governing body , recognized @entity39 , making it one of the few international bodies to place it alongside other nation states			1
but following the outbreak of the second intifada in 2000 , and the imposition of restrictions for residents of the @entity45 by the @entity175 , the local league was cancelled and national team players were prevented from traveling abroad to fulfil their fixtures			1
when qualification for the 2006 @entity30 began , so many players were prevented from leaving @entity180 and the @entity45 that only nine could start against @entity55 in a match in @entity183 , @entity184			1
today the team is a patchwork of bureaucracy			2
they fly on seven different sets of papers that make moving through every border , be it @entity193 , @entity175 or @entity194 , a tough task			0
one , @entity196 , plays for @entity197 in the @entity199 first division , a team set up by @entity25 immigrants			2
three others are @entity175 arabs who have played in @entity175 's first division while most of the rest play in @entity193 or for teams in the newly professional @entity206			2
the coach , @entity207 and his assistant are @entity210 @entity209 ; eight players and the goalkeeper coach are from @entity180 , which is controlled by the militant @entity25 movement @entity214 and in many ways cut off from the outside world			0
others have an @entity218 , a separate identity reserved for those @entity25 who live in the divided city or have family there			0
@entity180 - born players who now play in the @entity45 have recently been refused re-entry when trying to come home via @entity193			2
arguably the team 's best player , defender @entity224 , was repeatedly refused permission to leave @entity180 through @entity227 due to a ban on visas for men aged between 18 and 40			2
by the time he finally got out it was too late for him to make the team			2
@entity1 recalls first meeting his teammates			2
" their first impressions were : ' who the hell is this guy ? how the hell is this guy @entity25 ? ' but they welcomed me in like i was one of the brothers			0
it was n't like i was an outsider			0
no one was judging each other			0
" they could tell i had good intentions for the team			0
being an @entity9 i can explain to people in @entity9 what was going on in their country			2
" @entity1 believes victory on sunday will do far more than send @entity39 into the next round			1
" i think the match is huge man			0
@entity256 brings countries together and i do n't know a better way for the world to know about @entity39 apart from this soccer team , " he explained			1
" coming from outside , i feel that this is such a big step for this country			0
we can show that the @entity25 are normal people			0
