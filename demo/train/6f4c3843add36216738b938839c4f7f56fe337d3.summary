-- @entity2 's @entity1 ruled tuesday it is unconstitutional to punish an adult for private use of marijuana as long as it does n't harm anyone else			1
a recent poll showed 29 percent of @entity9 believe the best way to deal with marijuana is to legalize it			2
the unanimous ruling makes @entity2 the second @entity15 country in the past four days to allow personal use of a formerly illegal drug			1
the case in question involved five young men who were arrested for having a few marijuana cigarettes in their pockets			2
@entity1 @entity23 , who at one time supported laws that make personal use of marijuana illegal , told the state - run @entity29 news agency that " reality " changed his mind			1
@entity2 's action came amid growing momentum in @entity15 toward decriminalization of possessing small amounts of certain drugs			1
@entity38 enacted a law friday that decriminalizes possessing low quantities of most drugs , including marijuana , heroin , cocaine and @entity45			1
earlier this year , a @entity47 appeals court ruled that possession of drugs for personal use is not illegal			1
analysts see the shift in attitude as recognition that current methods in the war on drugs are not working			2
" it seems quite clear that drug policy based primarily on interdiction and enforcement has failed , " said @entity58 , a @entity15 national security adviser for president @entity59 in the late 1970s			0
" therefore , it 's natural for people to stand back and ask , ' is there a better way ? ' " pastor noted that some recent research has shown that handling drug use as a health challenge and focusing on treatment may be more efficient			0
" what @entity2 and @entity38 are doing in many ways is blazing a new path , " @entity68 said			1
@entity76 , president of the @entity78 policy institute in @entity79 , sees a trend at work			0
" it 's all part of a harm - reduction approach , " @entity76 said , noting that policymakers are shifting away from getting rid of drugs and toward figuring out how to reduce harm to users and society			1
@entity38 has been considering decriminalization for several years , particularly under the administration of former president @entity91 , who held office from 2000 - 2006			1
but efforts by the @entity38 congress toward decriminalization met with strong resistance from the administration of @entity9 president @entity98			1
" @entity38 tried it under @entity100 and the @entity9 got so snippety that they had to back down , " @entity76 said			1
president @entity104 's inauguration in january may have changed the calculus , analysts said			2
the @entity38 congress passed the measure in april and president @entity108 quietly signed it into law			1
in a visit to the @entity9 , @entity91 said in may a new approach is needed			0
" i believe it 's time to open the debate over legalizing drugs , " he told @entity0			2
" it must be done in conjunction with the @entity9 , but it is time to open the debate			0
" earlier this year , @entity100 's predecessor and two other former leaders of @entity15 nations also called for the decriminalization of marijuana for personal use and a change in strategy in the war on drugs			1
the three ex-presidents were members of the 17 - nation @entity129 , which issued its recommendations in february after studying the issue for a year			0
" the problem is that current policies are based on prejudices and fears and not on results , " former @entity133 president @entity132 said at a news conference in which the commission 's recommendations were presented			2
former president @entity142 of @entity47 said the group called for only the decriminalization of marijuana and not other illicit drugs because " you have to start somewhere			2
" @entity100 's predecessor , @entity148 , was president of @entity38 from 1994 to 2000			1
@entity132 was president of @entity133 from 1990 to 1994			0
and @entity142 led @entity47 from 1995 to 2002			0
in his swing through the @entity9 , @entity91 said any change in drug laws must be accompanied by an education campaign in schools and homes			0
and because the @entity9 is a large consumer of marijuana that comes from @entity15 , any steps toward legalization must be supported in @entity79 , he said			0
@entity132 had said in february that the time was right to start a debate on the subject because of the new administration in @entity79			0
" in many states in the @entity9 , as is the case in @entity166 , they have begun to change federal policies with regard to tolerating marijuana for therapeutic purposes			0
and in @entity79 there 's some consensus that the current policy is failing , " @entity132 said			0
the @entity78 's @entity76 said one recent poll showed that 29 percent of @entity9 think the best way to deal with marijuana is to legalize it			2
pastor , the former @entity59 official , wondered whether anyone in @entity79 is paying attention			0
" the question , " he said tuesday , " is whether the @entity9 will be open to this new path			0
