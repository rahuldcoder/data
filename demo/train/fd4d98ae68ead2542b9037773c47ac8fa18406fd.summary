church bells are to toll across the region at 9:30 a.m. and some websites plan to go dark in honor of the victims at the urging of @entity19 venture capitalist @entity18 , who came up with the idea at a @entity22 party attended by @entity23 , the former @entity24 congresswoman who was wounded in a 2011 shooting that killed six			1
@entity27 gov. @entity26 and @entity29 gov. @entity28 have called for residents of their states to pause to reflect one week after the shooting rampage			1

" and i 'm so thankful for everybody that 's here			2
" his voice trailed off as he struggled for composure			2
seeing the pink -- his slain daughter 's favorite color -- made him and his wife , @entity112 , " feel like we were getting a big hug from everybody			2
" " a lot of you do n't even know who she is			2
a lot of you never even met her , " he said			2
" and to see your love be expressed in that way for us was so meaningful , and we were so comforted			2
" @entity92 drew laughter when he said , " a lot of people have been asking how we 're doing			0
my opinion is , we need to come with an alternate way to greet somebody in this country			0
" he said the first days after the shooting felt like " we were mourning inside of a glass house , because there was so much attention on the whole situation , and it was really hard to deal with			0
" but then , as we come here and we start to see and feel all your love , we just know that everybody 's just deeply concerned and we can feel that love and it 's from a pure place and your intentions are so pure , we do n't feel like people are prying , " he continued			0
" we understand that you guys are there with us and that your pain and your sorrow is real and it 's deep			0
