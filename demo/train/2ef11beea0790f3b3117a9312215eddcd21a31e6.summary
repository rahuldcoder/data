-- it 's being presented as the future of cinema and a movie - going revolution			1
specs appeal : @entity6 is on its way to being free of 3d glasses as the format is rapidly advancing			1
while literally adding a new dimension to cinema - goers ' experience , @entity6 is also being touted as a means to help filmmakers reach new creative heights , make millions of dollars for @entity15 studios and curb the scourge of the industry -- piracy			1
@entity20 ceo @entity19 has likened the new 3d to the first sound and color in movies			1
director @entity26 's $ 200 million - plus sci - fi epic " @entity25 " is an expected genre - killer			2
the prestigious @entity28 this year opened with a 3d screening of @entity31 's " @entity30 "			1
but even as @entity15 studios and producers embrace digital 3d , they admit they are still learning how to use it			1
" we 've really gone past the point of seeing the technology as a barrier , " @entity39 ' captain 3d ' @entity37 told @entity0			1
@entity37 heads @entity20 ' drive to produce all its animated features in @entity6 after this year 's blockbuster " @entity47			2
" " the challenge now is 100 years of experience in how to make movies in @entity55 , " said @entity37 , speaking of a movie industry that has spent its existence flattening the @entity6 of real life for the silver screen			1
" as filmmakers , we have very little experience in thinking spatially , unlike a sculptor , " he said			2
" there 's going to be great filmmakers that are going to deliver experiences like you 've never seen before , " said @entity59 , a motion picture producer who helped launch @entity20 ' 3d foray and worked on " @entity63 " and " @entity64 , " the first time a photorealistic character was spliced into a live action movie			1
but " the storytelling is always king , " @entity59 told @entity0			2
" you can use these techniques to create a unique experience that makes that story impact on a more personal level with the audience			0
but it should never take away from the experience or lead the storytelling			1
" creative boom or creative killer ? filmmakers are greeting @entity6 with cautious excitement			1
" @entity55 is completely a mistake , " said @entity87 , the @entity88 - nominated director of @entity89 , at a recent press conference in @entity91 , @entity92			0
" it 's like when they criticized me because i use handheld , they said ' you 're very gimmicky ' , " the director said of his preferred camera style			0
" the way i experience life is handheld			0
@entity6 is the way we experience life			0
" but , @entity87 noted , there was a risk that the technology could distract from the story 's emotional catharsis , something that other creatives have also voiced concerns about			0
" [ @entity6 ] does n't guarantee a success or a good movie or a good movie experience , " said @entity111 , widely appreciated as a screenwriting guru			1
he noted that the talking pictures had their growing pains in the 1920 's ; @entity15 imported playwrights to craft dialogue but filmmakers paid more attention to cameras and sound recorders			1
" as we learned to use the technology , then it began to become an art form , " @entity111 told @entity0			0
" @entity6 right now is at its infant stages			0
" the rise of digital cinema has given @entity6 its legs			1
gone are the days of struggling to synch two separate projectors to create a 3d effect that would sometimes come with nausea or headaches			1
the iconic kitsch of the red and blue - lense cardboard glasses has been replaced by sleeker polarized aviator models			0
the future is @entity6 without glasses , delivered through autostereoscopic displays			0
digital projection is " rock steady " and could define how different generations take on @entity6 , said @entity59			2
" the way you interpret 3d images is that your brain looks at each separate image , the left and right image , and it stitches them together , " @entity59 said , likening it to adults using muscles they do n't normally use			2
" but kids , it 's all new to them , and they have n't had the painful experience of watching misaligned @entity6 in the 1970 's , the 1980 's , and the 1990 's			0
so i think the experience for them is a lot easier to interpret			0
" it 's no coincidence that animation is leading 3d releases , along with horror , @entity59 said , as the children who watched 2004 's " @entity168 " are growing up			2
" now you 're going to have to deliver them different kinds of content			0
so your audience is growing			0
" eyes on the prize for theatre owners , studios and distributors , @entity6 appears a healthy cash cow , with higher - priced tickets helping titles gross up to three times as much as their 2d counterparts			2
the @entity184 will have around 3,000 3d screens by the end of this year when " @entity25 " is scheduled for release , according to the @entity188 ( @entity188 )			1
about 90 to 100 screens are being added every month , though theatre operators are pausing in a tight credit market			0
" movie theatre owners are highly conscious of the expense involved in installing a 3d system , " said @entity192 , @entity193 at @entity188 , noting that out of approximately 600 theatrical releases this year , only 12 to 15 will be offered in @entity6			1
" no one knows right now how big the market will be , " @entity192 told @entity0			0
the studios are looking for scale			2
about " 5,000 screens in 2,000 to 3,000 locations " is the tipping point that would allow an exclusively @entity6 release , said @entity37			1
" that point should be reached within one or two years			1
" filling those theatres will be people who do n't want to watch bootleg versions , @entity15 hopes , as @entity6 comes with a promise that it 's hard to pirate			1
" if you are really determined , you can make a copy of anything , " said @entity37 , suggesting that @entity6 movies could be recorded through the same kind of lenses used in @entity6 glasses , but pirates would have to be " pretty serious " to pull it off			0
the real deterrent appears to be the widening gap between home and theatre			0
leaked dvd quality movies are being downloaded on better broadband internet and played on surround - sound home entertainment systems			0
@entity6 promises to deliver a unique experience in theatres that could allow @entity15 to take something back			1
studios and theatre owners insist there 's no real comparison			2
" comedies are funnier when everybody 's laughing			0
movies are scarier when everybody 's frightened			0
and that 's something that ca n't be replicated in the home , " @entity192 said			0
" it comes down to the kind of enjoyment you want from your movie experience , " @entity37 said , likening the choice to visiting the @entity247 or seeing a photograph , that " does n't capture the sense of the place , the space , how you felt when you were there			2

digital tech *impetus* behind 3d films ; studios still working out how best to use
format could lead to new creative boom in @entity15 , say *analysts*
movie industry suggests 3d films are much harder to pirate
advocates estimate tipping point of 5,000 3d theatres in @entity184 in two years
