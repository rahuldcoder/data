astronomers have found a deep azure blue planet orbiting a star 63 light years away -- the first time they 've been able to determine the actual color of a planet outside our solar system , @entity0 and the @entity1 said thursday			1
the planet , known as @entity11 , is a gas giant with a daytime temperature of 2,000 degrees @entity14 where it possibly rains liquid glass sideways amid 4,500 mph winds , @entity0 says			1
the blue color comes not from the reflection of an ocean , as on @entity22 , " but rather a hazy , blow - torched atmosphere containing high clouds laced with silicate particles , " @entity0 says			1
" @entity26 condensing in the heat could form very small drops of glass that scatter blue light more than red light			1
" the space agencies said astronomers using the @entity34 discovered the planet in 2005 but only now have they been able to use @entity34 's observations to determine the deep blue color			1
the findings are in the august 1 issue of @entity40			0
to deduce the planet 's color , astronomers measured how much light was reflected off its surface			1
they used the @entity34 's @entity34 to look at the planet before , during and after it passed behind its star as it orbited			1
" we saw the brightness of the whole system drop in the blue part of the spectrum when the planet passed behinds its star , " said @entity48 of the @entity49 , the first author of the paper			2
" from this , we can gather that the planet is blue , because the signal remained constant at the other colors we measured			2
" the planet is only 2.9 million miles from its parent star , so close that it is gravitationally locked , @entity0 says			2
one side always faces the star and the other side is always dark			0
by contrast , @entity66 , the closest planet in our solar system to the sun , is 29 million miles away from the sun at its closest			2
in 2007 , @entity0 's @entity72 measured the infrared light , or heat , from the hd 189733b			0
it showed day side and night side temperatures differ by about 500 degrees @entity14 , which should cause fierce winds to roar from the day side to the night side , @entity0 said			1
the atmosphere , the space agencies say , is changeable and exotic			0
@entity11 is in a class of planets called " hot @entity85 , " which are similar in size to the gas giants in our solar system but instead lie very close to their parent star , the @entity1 says			0
" we know that hot @entity85 are numerous throughout the universe , " the @entity1 said in a statement			0
" as we do not have one close to home in our own solar system , studies of planets like hd 189733b are important to help us understand these dramatic objects			0

it is the first time astronomers have determined the color of an *exoplanet*
the planet is 63 light years away
temperatures reach as high as 2,000 degrees @entity14
it possibly rains glass sideways in 4,500 - mph winds
