chairman of the @entity2 @entity1 sent @entity4 and @entity5 officials scrambling on tuesday , insisting that the chief military officer 's comments on @entity8 do n't contradict president @entity10 's pledge to " not get dragged into another ground war in @entity15 " and not put @entity12 " boots on the ground			1
" the uproar started after @entity1 said that if @entity17 retakes the strategically important @entity18 in @entity15 , he would recommend that some of the 1,700 @entity12 forces currently in @entity15 could move to the front lines to advise @entity15 troops trying to get the dam back			1
those troops would then be advisers in a combat role			2
" if we reach the point where i believe our advisers should accompany @entity15 troops on attacks against specific ( @entity17 ) targets , i will recommend that to the president , " @entity1 said during a @entity27 hearing on tuesday			1
@entity4 press secretary @entity35 said @entity1 was just responding to a hypothetical situation			1
the policy -- no boots on the ground -- remains			1
" it 's the responsibility of the president 's military advisers to plan and consider all the wide range of contingencies , " said @entity35			1
" it 's also the responsibility of the commander - in - chief to set out a clear policy			0
and the president has been clear about what that policy is			0
he reiterated it on a number of occasions ... the president does not believe that it would be in the best interest of our national security to deploy @entity12 ground troops in a combat role in @entity15 and @entity62			1
that policy has not changed			0
" @entity4 leaders lobby wavering colleagues ahead of @entity17 vote so what 's the difference ? if 1,700 @entity12 forces are already on the ground in @entity15 why are n't they considered " boots on the ground " ? for starters , those 1,700 @entity12 are n't currently the " close combat advisers " that @entity1 said he could recommend			1
today , advisers are n't supposed to be near combat			0
" he was n't talking about specific troops in a combat role on the ground , more advising and assisting at a lower level , " rear adm. @entity78 told @entity80 's @entity79			2
@entity1 also made it clear that @entity12 military advisers on the ground are currently in a " combat advisory role " and " not participating in direct combat -- and there is " no intention for them to do so			1
" but @entity12 soldiers are always combat - ready , @entity1 said			2
" that 's all we grow			0
we -- when we bring a young man or woman in the military , they come in to be a combat soldier or a combat marine ... we do n't bring them in to be anything other than combat capable , " @entity1 said			2
retired lt. gen. @entity105 said he read @entity10 's pledge not to put " boots on the ground " as ensuring no " large formations of @entity12 " would enter combat			1
" i do n't see gen. @entity1 -- who i know pretty well -- contradicting the president at all , " @entity105 told @entity80			1
what 's the world going to do about @entity17 ? but if @entity10 were to approve putting military advisers in " close combat roles , " the risk of @entity12 casualties would increase -- regardless of whether those troops are firing weapons themselves or advising @entity15 forces who are			1
that 's because a combat support role can turn into combat " in a heartbeat , " retired gen. @entity124 said			0
" enemy advances are not distinctive , you could suddenly be in the midst of a really hairy dogfight and you think you 're just refueling trucks , " @entity130 said			0
ultimately the distinction between boots on the ground and troops in advisory roles is semantic , retired lt. col. @entity141 said on @entity80			2
" right now we 've got young @entity12 men and women putting their lives on the line dropping bombs , " @entity141 said			0
" we 've got people in combat , i think we should just say that			0
" and @entity1 produced a quick and direct response when sen. @entity151 of @entity152 , ranking member of the @entity153 , asked @entity1 whether @entity12 pilots dropping bombs over @entity15 are in a combat mission and whether the @entity12 would " put boots on the ground " to rescue a downed pilot			1
" yes and yes , " @entity1 confirmed			0
@entity151 also lasered in on @entity10 's " boots on the ground " distinction later tuesday in an interview with @entity80			1
" the president 's just flat not telling the truth			0
we already have boots on the ground there , " said @entity151 , a chief political antagonist of the @entity4			2
" he knows we 're going to have to have boots on the ground			0
let 's just go ahead and face it and admit we 're in a war and you just do n't win a war unless you 're out there fighting			0
" who is doing what in the coalition battle against @entity17 ? while @entity1 insisted the current strategy is the right one , the top general made it clear that he was n't ruling anything out			2
@entity1 's more open position comes after president @entity10 has faced criticism from @entity190 and military strategists for completely shutting the door on ever sending @entity12 combat troops to @entity15			1
" i would never tell the enemy what i was willing to do or unwilling to do , " house speaker @entity194 said last week			0
" the president has made clear that he does n't want @entity12 boots on the ground			0
well , somebody 's boots have to be on the ground			1
" @entity10 faced similar criticism from sens. @entity204 of @entity205 and @entity207 's @entity206			2
and while @entity10 's unequivocal statements about combat troops may give @entity17 insight into the @entity12 military playbook , the president 's statements aim to reassure a war - weary @entity12 public			1
while three - quarters of @entity12 favor airstrikes against @entity17 , 61 % of @entity12 oppose putting @entity12 forces in combat situations in @entity15 and @entity62 , according to a september 8 @entity80 / @entity220 poll			2
but after ordering 475 more military advisers to @entity15 , @entity10 has kicked up the total @entity12 military presence in the country to about 1,700			1
and the line separating combat troops from military advisers could become more blurred with time , said @entity228 , a history and public affairs professor at @entity230			1
and @entity12 casualties could push the @entity12 to ramp up the military effort in @entity15			2
" whenever you put someone in danger overseas whether they 're fighting or advising , it gives the potential to get bigger , " @entity228 said			0
" any war can expand into something much greater , you just ca n't predict how it will unfold			0
" @entity12 casualties could tip the balance , he said , noting that the current escalation came shortly after two @entity12 journalists were beheaded by @entity17 in a video posted online			0
" you can imagine the same thing happening with two people who are serving directly the @entity12 government , " @entity228 said			0
how many more @entity252 captives is @entity17 holding ?			0

gen. @entity1 goes to @entity8 , makes remarks that have @entity4 scrambling
the @entity2 chairman talks about military advisers in @entity15
the point could come when advisers would go with @entity15 troops attacking @entity17 , he said
@entity4 says he was talking hypothetically -- @entity10 's no boots on the ground remains
