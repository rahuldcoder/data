-- an @entity2 designer and former refugee has developed a low - cost , wind - powered mine detonating device inspired by the toys he played with as a child			1
@entity9 's @entity8 is composed almost entirely from bamboo and biodegradable plastics , with a skeletal structure of spiky plungers that resembles a giant spherical tumbleweed from another planet			1
at 70 kilograms , @entity16 says his invention is light enough to be propelled by a normal breeze , while still being heavy and big enough - 190cm in diameter - to activate mines as it rolls over them			1
according to the @entity24 , there are more than 110 million active mines scattered across 70 countries , with an equal number stockpiled around the world still waiting to be planted			0
meanwhile , manual diffusion by trained mine - clearing experts remains the most common method of removal globally , according to the @entity33 , an industry publication published by the @entity35			1
but this method can be prohibitively expensive - in some cases it costs thousands of dollars to clear just a single mine			1
by contrast , @entity16 claims the @entity40 -- which includes a basic gps tracking device used to record the area " cleared " by its tumbling path - costs as little as $ 40 to build			1
" the core sphere that contains the gps system is high enough from the ground to avoid damage from most anti-personnel mines , " explained @entity16			0
the lengths of the spikes are based on the height of an adult 's leg - because the kinds of mines that it is designed to clear are those that will take a leg off below the waist of an adult			2
" so , as it moves the spikes get blown off , but the center stays intact , " @entity16 said			0
" it can withstand up to four explosions before it loses too many of its legs to carry on			0
" as a young kid growing up in @entity2 , @entity16 did what children the world over do : made up games and created his own toys			1
" one of them was a little rolling object that was carried by the wind , " he recalled			2
" we would race them against each other in the local fields			0
" sometimes , due to the presence of landmines , they would roll off into places that we were n't permitted to go			0
" after his father was killed in a rocket attack during the late 1980s , @entity16 fled @entity2 with his mother , brother and sisters			1
living first in @entity88 , then traveling through central @entity89 and ending up four years later as a refugee in @entity91 , @entity16 went on to study at the @entity92 in @entity93			0
what started life as his final graduate design project has since undergone strength testing at the hands of the @entity91 military			0
this year , a full - scale mock - up was tested in the deserts around @entity102 and @entity16 hopes to fundraise $ 100,000 so he can engineer the design to mass produced , industry standards			1
however , some are skeptical about @entity8 's chances of ever meeting the official @entity108 ( @entity108 ) -- considered to be the minimum grade of delivery for responsible mine clearing operations			1
" there are many citizens who live in mine - affected areas who carry out their own @entity121 clearances , and while this is noble it is also very dangerous , " explained @entity112 , head of operations at the @entity115 - based @entity114			1
" for any mine clearing technology to be adopted by a serious mine action organization , it needs to conform to @entity108			2
" as much as i welcome all new ideas -- and i think this is a nice concept with great potential to raise awareness and perhaps inspire other solutions -- i ca n't see it meeting those standards in anything like its current form , " he said			1
@entity112 , who stresses that his assessment is based solely on what he has read and viewed online , believes that @entity16 's creation is undermined by its dependence on the " serendipity of random gusts " -- making it a haphazard option in a field traditionally characterized by highly methodical techniques			0
" every square centimeter of land should be properly checked , " he said			0
" i 'm also not convinced that the device can be relied upon to necessarily detonate every mine it crosses , " said @entity112 , who argues that if a couple of its spikes are blown off during a clearance , then the holes in its structure could cause it to miss other mines as it rolls on			1
" it looks to me that there is also a huge limitation in terms of terrain , " he added			0
" i ca n't see it working on hills or areas with dense vegetation			0
" @entity16 says he is aware of these limitations , and claims to have a number of solutions in the pipeline			0
" we are developing a remote - controlled model with a motor and a metal detector -- so that even if it fails to detonate a mine , it should map - out the presence of metal structures underneath , " he said			2
whether the @entity182 can be engineered to overcome the criticisms of industry insiders like @entity112 , the strikingly - designed structure with its poetic symmetry has already brought the issue of landmine clearance to new audiences in the design world			2
it was recently showcased during @entity192 and the @entity193 , and in march of next year will enjoy a run at @entity196 's prestigious @entity195 " the design industry is perhaps too focused on tables and chairs , " said @entity16			2
" i think we can use our talents to find design - based solutions to more serious problems			0

@entity8 is a cheap , light , wind - powered mine detonating device
created by an @entity2 designer who was inspired by toys he modeled as a child
industry expert says concept is *laudable* , but does not currently meet safety standards
