@entity0 , @entity1 -- just after the @entity3 completed its drawdown of combat brigades in @entity1 , militants wednesday launched a wave of bombings across the country , mostly targeting security forces			1
at least 48 people died and at least 286 others were wounded in 13 cities			1
the locations included @entity0 , the capital , and large towns in the northern , western , and southern quadrants of the nation			2
the only region that appeared to be spared the onslaught was the three - province @entity22 autonomous region in the north			2
investigators do n't yet know whether these strikes were coordinated , but a similar series of strikes that occurred in may bore the hallmarks of @entity30 in @entity1			2
on that day , 85 people died and more than 300 others were wounded in coordinated shootings and bombings across six provinces			1
" the fact that these events coincide with @entity39 only adds to extremists ' desires to make a violent statement by murdering others and capturing the day 's news , " said maj. gen. @entity36 , the @entity3 military spokesman in @entity1			1
. the latest attacks come as the number of @entity3 troops in @entity1 has now fallen below 50,000 -- the lowest level since the @entity3 - led invasion in 2003			1
the @entity3 - led combat mission formally ends august 31 , and the remainder of @entity3 troops will train , assist and advise the @entity1			1
but the @entity3 residual force -- comprising what is to be called @entity55 on september 1 -- is combat - ready			1
while it has a different mission , it has the same capabilities as combat troops			2
if requested by the @entity1 , these soldiers can go into combat and can deploy these skills for self - defense			2
all @entity3 troops are scheduled to pull out at the end of 2011 , but the @entity1 government could request that some of them remain			1
the departure of the @entity3 - led combat mission is a seminal moment in a country that wants to see whether @entity1 police and soldiers can effectively handle the kind of insurgent activity that periodically erupts in this turbulent environment			1
overall violence in @entity1 has declined considerably over the past two years compared with the height of the sectarian war between 2005 and 2007			1
but there has been a recent campaign of bombings and shootings in @entity0 targeting traffic police , @entity1 soldiers and local leaders , and tensions across the country have been exacerbated by a political crisis -- the failure of @entity1 lawmakers to form a government nearly six months after national elections			1
" today 's attacks clearly involved planning by extremists , criminals and terrorists to take advantage of the ongoing frustrations of @entity1 people with the government impasse , as well as exploit the changing @entity3 mission toward stability operations that takes effect sept. 1 , " @entity36 said			1
@entity36 also stressed that the @entity1 government needs to " form now			1
" wednesday 's attacks reflect the challenges the indigenous police and soldiers face			2

in this instance , an @entity3 adviser accompanied @entity1 forces , a practice that has been routine			1

in @entity216 , in the north , a suicide bomber driving a car tried to attack an @entity1 army security checkpoint but security forces shot and detonated the car			0
in the @entity148 province town of @entity223 , in the north , bombs left outside five homes wounded at least four people , police said			2
four policemen and an electoral commission official lived in the dwellings			0
the violence underscores the anxiety in @entity1 over the tenacity of the insurgents and the progress of the @entity1 security forces			2
@entity36 said that @entity1 security forces have shown " an enormous will and ability to take on extremists , criminals and terrorists " and are " fully committed and determined " to protect @entity1			0
" the @entity242 took a blow , but they are not on the ropes and will meet these challenges head on			0
they are not being pushed out of neighborhoods and are not giving up an inch of ground			0
when attacked , they take control of the situation and regain immediate security of the area			0
" @entity36 said the military has reiterated " that attacks were likely to occur during this period " and that 's " why our top priority in our ongoing role of advising , training and assisting the @entity1 security forces through 2011 is improving their overall operational capabilities			0
" " rooting out these extremist , criminal and terrorist cells will remain a top priority for both our ongoing assistance mission and our support for partnered counter-terrorism operations in the months ahead , " @entity36 said			0
" there is still difficult work to be done here			0
this is why we are staying committed in @entity1 with a significant military capability to advise , train and assist @entity1 security forces until our mission ends in december of 2011			0
" analysts warn that the @entity1 conflict will be persistent for years			0
@entity278 , a national security analyst at the @entity279 , wrote last week that the conflict " is not over " and " is at as critical a stage as at any time since 2003			0
" @entity1 , he says , continues to grapple with a " serious insurgency , " ethnic tension and great economic challenges			0
" regardless of the reasons for going to war , everything now depends on a successful transition to an effective and unified @entity1 government , and @entity1 security forces that can bring both security and stability to the average @entity1			2
the creation of such an ' end state ' will take a minimum of another five years , and probably ten , " he wrote			0
