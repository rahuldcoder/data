-- a nun and two peace activists could spend the rest of their lives in federal prison after being convicted of breaching one of the nation 's most secure nuclear facilities			1
after two days of testimony , a federal jury in @entity10 , @entity11 , found sister @entity13 , 83 ; @entity15 - @entity14 , 57 ; and @entity16 , 63 , guilty of destroying @entity18 government property and depredation against federal property exceeding $ 1,000			1
that could mean up to 30 years in prison , according to @entity23 , @entity0 's affiliate in @entity10			1
the three are scheduled to be sentenced on september 23			0
when the guilty verdict was read wednesday evening , the three defendants appeared content , even singing along with protest hymns before they were taken into custody , according to @entity23			1
" they 're at peace about this , they 're peace makers , and they knew that they risked this , " @entity30 , attorney for @entity16 , told the @entity10 station			2
" nobody is happy to go jail , but they understand			0
" in the predawn hours of july 28 , 2012 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity16 walked under the cover of darkness through the woods and up a hillside , approaching a chain - link fence surrounding the @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity11			1
armed with flashlights and a bolt cutter , they cut their way through the fence , fully expecting to be arrested on the spot			0
instead , they walked nearly a mile , cutting through four fences in all , breaching what was supposed to be the most tightly secured uranium processing and storage facility in the country			0
" when we got to the very high security fence where there 's a lethal force authorized ... i thought , maybe we should turn around , " @entity14 told @entity0 's @entity68			1
hours later , the three activists were finally confronted by a guard after hoisting banners , spray - painting messages and splattering human blood on a building that houses highly enriched uranium			2
they have said they wanted call attention to the dangers of nuclear weapons , but their actions triggered a very different concern : if three older peaceniks can easily trespass onto what was once considered the " @entity84 " for highly enriched uranium , just how safe are the nation 's nuclear weapons material from terrorists ? nuclear weapons interactive : who has what ? since the incident , @entity91 has held a series of hearings and issued security recommendations to the @entity96 and its @entity97 , which runs @entity49 and seven other nuclear weapons sites			1
most recently , deputy energy secretary @entity99 testified before the @entity100 in march that the @entity96 has taken " several major actions ... to improve security " since the y - 12 breach , including management changes and independent security reviews			0
today , changes at @entity49 are noticeable			0
a new security contractor is in charge			0
new signs and security fences are going up			0
while last year 's security breach shed light on systematic weaknesses at @entity49 , a former nuclear reactor safety manager at the @entity115 in @entity116 said he does n't think the nation 's nuclear weapons material were ever at any risk			1
" what these people did was more like trespassing than gaining access to any weapons - grade material , " said @entity121 , who is now a vice provost and dean at @entity123			1
" once they got in , they could spray paint things , but it 's just like if you got into @entity84 , you would n't know the combination to the locks			0
" @entity121 said the country 's nuclear weapons material is spread across eight sites that are " usually out in the middle of nowhere " to protect against threats			1
" there 's really only one place where the weapons are fully assembled ; i 'm not going to tell you which one , " @entity121 said			2
" and the reason there are eight places , they do n't want people to have the full knowledge ( of what the other facilities do )			0
" we almost never see an assembled nuclear weapon			2
" but another nuclear security expert said the y - 12 breach was more than just trespassing by a few environmental protesters			2
" this was a very serious incident because they penetrated the protected area , and that 's when there was supposed to be an immediate security response , " said @entity157 , a senior scientist with @entity158 , a watchdog group that monitors the @entity96 and the @entity159			0
" if they had been trained , the kind of paramilitary group that the @entity96 is supposed to be ensuring they can protect against , with hand - carried explosives , other breaching tools , physical access to the building structure ... the guards would have already lost			0
" @entity157 said the breach was not an isolated incident			0
" it was a result of this reduced central oversight , giving contractors more responsibility for supervising themselves , and that 's an invitation of corner - cutting and complacency to set in , " he said			0
the incident not only broke the public 's trust that the government is " exercising good oversight " of its nuclear weapons facilities , according to @entity157 , but he said it also has " global implications			1
" " if we ca n't even control our own nuclear weapons material , it shows what a major challenge it is around the world ... that have comparably dangerous materials but are even less protected			1
and , @entity157 pointed out , if the @entity18 appears to have vulnerabilities in protecting its nuclear weapons material , " then that not only reduces our authority to criticize other countries , it raising questions about the integrity of our own security			1
" @entity0 's @entity68 and @entity209 contributed to this report .			2

three peace activists have been convicted of trespassing , *defacing* a nuclear weapons site
the incident last year took place at the @entity218 in @entity50 , @entity11
they could face 30 years in prison , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity23
