@entity0 -- the nation 's top intelligence officials told senators they used not only intelligence but clues in social media to keep abreast of recent uprisings in the @entity9 and @entity10 , but they admitted the task is a daunting one given the overwhelming amount of information available			1
the officials were defending intelligence community efforts at the @entity17 hearing , during which chairwoman @entity18 , d - @entity19 , questioned whether the @entity20 and other agencies were adequately following clues in social media in the lead - up to popular revolts that deposed the leaders of @entity26 and @entity27 and have sprung up in other countries			1
" i think we were at fault in that regard , " she said			0
director of national intelligence @entity33 defended the efforts of the open source center in tracking all media , but acknowledged more needed to be done			1
cia director @entity38 told the lawmakers there is a massive amount of data out there to follow -- 600 million @entity45 accounts , 190 million @entity47 accounts and 35,000 hours of @entity49 videos			1
he said , " the real challenge is how to be able , going through the diversity of languages , going through the different sites that are out there , how do we look at the relevant websites to be able to draw from them the kind of information that would help us so this involves a tremendous amount of analysis			0
" both @entity33 and @entity38 added that the social media sites are not necessarily predictive of what might happen			1
@entity33 sought to clarify a comment that was roundly criticized when he said the fundamentalist @entity66 in @entity27 was a " secular " group			2
he told the assembled senators that he regretted that his comment last week was misunderstood and that his message was lost			0
" the @entity66 is obviously not secular			2
what i had hoped to convey and i would like to clearly state here is , the @entity66 attempts to work through a political system that has been largely secular in its orientation , " @entity33 said			2
he went on to say the @entity66 would likely be part of the process in @entity27 , as would many other opposition groups			2
@entity18 expressed concern about whether @entity79 intelligence knew enough about the @entity66 's positions			1
@entity33 was unable to give definitive answers to a series of questions she posed about whether the group supported @entity27 's peace agreement with @entity87 , had ties to @entity89 and if it supported efforts to stop weapons from going into @entity92			0
noting that the @entity66 has been portrayed by some as desiring a secular government , @entity18 cautioned , " from an intelligence standpoint , it is critical that we know that position and what is apt to happen			1
@entity27 is the key country in the @entity9 and i worry about that			0
" the ability of the @entity79 to handle current and future terrorist suspects was also on the minds of many senators during the annual hearing on world threats			0
@entity38 was asked what would happen if @entity108 leader @entity107 or his deputy , @entity109 , were captured			1
" we would probably move them quickly into military jurisdiction at @entity111 for questioning and then eventually move them into @entity121 , " said @entity38 , referring to the @entity111 @entity79 @entity110 in @entity112 and the @entity114 detention facility in @entity115			1
sen. @entity122 of @entity123 , the ranking @entity124 on the committee , agreed @entity114 would be the best place for them to go , but pointed out the @entity129 administration is moving to close the facility			1
after the hearing , @entity20 spokesman @entity131 issued a statement clarifying @entity38 's remarks : " as director @entity33 made clear , and as director @entity38 agrees , any decision about what might happen if @entity107 and other terrorists are captured would be a decision for policymakers , and would have to be informed by the circumstances of his capture			1
the director fully supports the president 's commitment to close the prison at @entity114 because , as our military commanders have made clear , it 's in our national security interest to do so			1
" a senior counterterrorism official also said , " the odds of @entity107 and @entity109 being captured alive are about as good as vodka losing favor among @entity152			2
" two years ago , president @entity129 announced his intention to close the facility , a policy which has been heavily criticized by @entity124 members of @entity157			0
the administration is still trying to sort out what to do with the 172 suspected terrorists who remain at the facility			0
some will be put on trial although it is unclear where and whether it will be before a civilian or military court			0
a number will be sent to other countries if arrangements can be worked out			0
and there is the question of what to do with the detainees who can not be tried and there is no other nation willing or able to take them			0
@entity122 also pointed out that a quarter of released detainees return to the battlefield			0
@entity33 noted that the president suspended repatriations to @entity181 because that country does not properly monitor or rehabilitate the former prisoners			0
@entity18 brought up her growing concern with @entity186 's failure to adequately cooperate with the @entity79 on counterterrorism efforts			1
she accused the @entity186 intelligence service of taking both sides of the street and cited the military 's failure to pursue terrorists in @entity194			2
@entity38 said that although the @entity186 have helped in some areas , it is a very complicated relationship that requires him to be part @entity20 director , part diplomat			1
" they look at issues related to their national interests and take steps that further complicate our relationship and create tensions between our country and theirs , " @entity38 said			2
" what i try to convince the @entity186 of is that we have a common enemy and we have common issues that require partnership and cooperation of both countries in order to be able to deal with those threats			0
