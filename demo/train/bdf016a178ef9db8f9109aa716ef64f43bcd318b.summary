-- @entity2 's @entity1 has acknowledged that he killed @entity4 insurgents on his latest tour of duty in @entity7 as a crew member of an @entity10 attack helicopter			1
@entity1 has been serving for four months as a co-pilot gunner ( @entity12 ) in southern @entity14 province -- considered a @entity4 heartland -- and flew on scores of missions with the trigger to rockets , missiles and a 30mm cannon at his fingertips			1
no one is saying how many insurgents @entity1 might have killed but toward the end of his deployment , the 28 - year - old , known to his comrades as captain @entity28 , shared some of his feelings about combat with reporters while on duty in the massive military base known as @entity38			1
he said it was sometimes justified to " take a life to save a life			0
that 's what we revolve around , i suppose			2
" more : how ' soldier prince ' tore up royal rule book @entity1 explained how the roles of @entity48 and @entity49 have changed since his previous deployments in 2007 and 2008			1
" it used to be very much : front seat , you 're firing the whole time			2
" now , yes we fire when we have to but essentially we 're more of a deterrent than anything else			1
" our job out here is to make sure the guys are safe on the ground and if that means shooting someone who is shooting at them , then we will do it , " said the prince , third in line to the @entity2 throne			1
" it 's not the reason i decided to do this job			2
the reason to do this job was to get back out here , and carry on with a job			0
" away from his helicopter , the prince mixed freely on base , eating in the canteen with everyone else and relaxing by playing video games with others in the 130 - strong @entity82 , @entity83 ( @entity84 )			2
with those comrades , he was just " one of the guys			2
" more : @entity1 named world 's most eligible bachelor in contrast to his privileged upbringing in palaces and an education at @entity94 , the prince lived in a shared room within shipping containers converted into an accommodation block			1
he said he was free to stroll around the base , to visit the gym or the laundry			0
" it 's completely normal , " @entity1 added			1
but he said he still received unwanted attention in more public places			0
" for me it 's not that normal because i go into the cookhouse and everyone has a good old gawp , and that 's one thing that i dislike about being here , " he said			2
opinion : @entity111 vs. dull brother @entity112 " because there 's plenty of guys in there that have never met me , therefore look at me as prince @entity1 and not as captain @entity28 , which is frustrating			1
" which is probably another reason why i 'd love to be out in the @entity121 ( patrol bases ) , away from it all			0
" but yeah , it 's completely normal			0
it 's as normal as it 's going to get			0
i 'm one of the guys			0
i do n't get treated any differently			0
" his deployment meant he could step back from the public eye , although he said his father , the heir to the @entity2 throne @entity131 , often reminded him of his position			1
@entity1 admitted he had " let himself and his family down " when he was photographed naked at a party in a @entity137 hotel last year			1
@entity138 romp : ' i let my family down ' he also expressed frustration about the media			0
referring to the tv producer whom he was addressing , he said : " i never wanted you guys to be out here , but there was an agreement made to invite you out on the deal that the media did n't speculate before my deployment			0
that 's the only reason you guys are out here			0
" @entity1 appeared happier talking about his military role : building up the @entity157 , the @entity157 , so it can eventually take over			1
" it 's great to see the @entity157 taking more of a lead in things as well			0
and the professionalism is definitely shining through			0
" that 's something his superiors in the army might say of the prince himself			2
