@entity0 has raked in billions and will make a splash when its stock hits the open market next week			1
so , what are folks on @entity6 concerned about ? @entity8 's hoodie , apparently			1
@entity9 , an analyst for @entity10 , told @entity11 that the @entity0 ceo 's decision to show up for a meeting with potential investors dressed down in his trademark casual outerwear suggests that he 's too immature to run a massive corporation			1
" he 's actually showing investors he does n't care that much ; he 's going to be him , " @entity9 said in an interview on @entity19			0
" i think that 's a mark of immaturity			0
" i think that he has to realize he 's bringing investors in as a new constituency right now , and i think he 's got to show them the respect that they deserve because he 's asking them for their money			0
" if nothing else , @entity9 's take ( and he still thinks @entity0 is a solid investment ) reinforces the inevitable culture clash that occurs when a 27 - year - old titan of @entity42 's freewheeling startup culture meets the buttoned - down world of @entity6			1
it 's not a new phenomenon : @entity8 is known for his ever - present t - shirt and sandals , and in @entity0 's early days , he once showed up for a meeting with a venture - capital firm in his pajamas			1
@entity9 went on to say that @entity8 might be a better product manager or designer than ceo			1
needless to say , the tech world got a good laugh out of it all			0
the @entity58 led with this not - so - subtle headline : " odd analyst mocks @entity8 's hoodie , ironically sounding stupid in a suit while doing so			1
" in the article , @entity63 notes that if @entity8 had shown up in a suit , it could actually have signaled that @entity0 was moving away from its winning formula , which could spook employees ( and presumably investors ) who like the way things run now			1
" and finally : ' he 's going to be him , and he 's going to do what he 's always done , ' " @entity63 writes			0
" that 's to say that he 's going to build a $ 100 billion business and change the world ? that 's what the hoodie signifies ? well then , i think that he should n't take it off at all costs ! " tech blogger @entity84 had a more blunt take on @entity9 's remarks			2
" this analyst is smoking stuff that is outside the realm of legality , " he wrote			0
" now if you were looking for a problem with @entity8 's hoodie , then you should see it for what it really is : a fashion abomination			1
" and box ceo @entity98 weighed in on @entity99 : " @entity100 ceo : no hoodie ; @entity102 ceo : no hoodie ; @entity0 ceo : hoodie			1
coincidence ? " it 's not like @entity8 does n't know how to clean up			2
he donned a coat and tie last year when he and other technology luminaries had dinner with president @entity111 , and wore a suit a few months later when @entity111 visited @entity0 for a town hall event			2
in fact , he bucked the @entity116 look for an entire year not so long ago			0
on his @entity117 , @entity8 wrote that , in 2009 , he wore a tie every day			2
" after the start of the recession in 2008 , i wanted to signal to everyone at @entity0 that this was a serious year for us , " he wrote			2
" great companies thrive by investing more heavily while everyone else is cutting back during a recession			0
but great companies also make sure they 're financially strong and sustainable			0
" my tie was the symbol of how serious and important a year this was , and i wore it every day to show this			0
" maybe @entity8 , sitting on the verge of a blockbuster stock offering , no longer feels the need to prove himself .			0
