-- @entity2 's recent decision to postpone her @entity4 tour to stay home with her elderly and ailing dog may have caused some upset among her fans , but she 's won a whole pack of new ones who thoroughly support and understand that decision all too well			1
i am one of them			2
@entity14 told us when it was time for him to go			1
i 'd always heard that a suffering animal would do that , but he was my first dog , and i was thoroughly unprepared for how clear and desperate that message would be			1
" @entity14 " was a massive name for a mammoth dog , the @entity22 my now - husband owned when i met him			1
he became mine also , and i his -- so fiercely that he escorted me down the aisle when @entity25 and i wed a year and half later			2
we were not always so gracefully aligned			2
the night i met @entity14 , he tried to kill me			1
i tried not to take it personally , as he was being a good dog protecting his @entity29 from the strange lady who 'd apparently come over to eat his face			1
it was our second date , and i was deeply enamored of the notion that in @entity34 , i 'd found an attractive , single , straight 30 - something man with the wherewithal to be responsible for the welfare of two animals who had to be escorted outside to poop			2
losing a dog : share your tributes on @entity44 we were perhaps a shade distracted by frantic kissing as we arrived at his apartment , and failed to take the time to warn the four legged residents that they 'd be receiving a visitor			1
@entity25 inched the door open , and a snarling , drooling wall of cream - colored , @entity56 fur burst forth			0
i stood paralyzed , having never seen an animal that size in person outside a zoo -- and certainly not lunging directly at my throat			0
with @entity25 holding him back , i could finally fully appreciate the scale of this beast			0
with his paws on my 6 - foot - tall date 's shoulders , he still loomed a full head higher			1
he was couch - sized			0
he was pony - sized			0
he was the most majestic animal i 'd ever seen -- and he wanted nothing to do with me			0
some dogs -- like @entity14 's little companion @entity72 the whippet -- give away their full and sloppy hearts as a matter of course			1
they 're in love with the world and show that with enviable abandon			0
@entity14 cared only for his @entity29 , and whatever bites of food he could snag from the tabletop			1
i was , at most , a barrier between him and the exact spot on the couch that he wished to occupy			0
@entity14 the @entity22 helps himself to @entity85 but that was ok , somehow			1
i had @entity72 ( and her @entity29 ) to curl up with elsewhere , and i enjoyed being part of @entity14 's orbit and entourage			1
if you 've ever walked an @entity22 through a @entity34 neighborhood , you 've had a small glimpse into what it 's like to be a celebrity			1
they take pictures at the grossest moments possible			0
they ask endless , repetitive questions			0
" how much does he eat ? " " is he a pony ? can i ride him ? " " how much does he weigh ? " " how much does he poop ? " ( answers : lots , no , no , 135 pounds , why in the world would you want to know that ? ) he strode along the streets of @entity34 with us in tow , and ran through fields in @entity117 , and i fell into his strong and solid rhythm -- until one day that changed			0
he stumbled , walking up the steps to the apartment , and then threw up his dinner			0
as @entity25 set about the massive task of cleaning up after that , i ran to the store to get some stomach - soothing soup for him			0
i warmed it up on the stove for him , then let it cool in his bowl as he stared up at me , slightly dazed , through his long , shaggy eyebrows			0
he lapped up every last drop and then leaned against me for the very first time			0
dogs express their love and trust in many ways -- some lap at your face , knock you down with kisses as you come home , leave a half - dead animal on your pillow , or sit on your lap and sigh with contentment			2
the large and stoic ones tend to lean			0
it 's the best feeling in the universe			2
but @entity14 -- big , proud , poor @entity151 -- he leaned against me the next day after losing control and wetting the carpet for the first time ever , and @entity25 and i leaned onto each other , hard and sobbing , when we heard the word " tumor " the day after that			1
some violent dose of medication shrunk the squash - sized lump then , and earned him and us a year - long reprieve during which that initially jealous beast became a member of my family -- our family			0
the leans came more and more frequently -- and even the occasional chin lick , which made me feel like the queen of the world ( or at least the new @entity174 apartment that we all now shared )			0
one lazy summer sunday , with our dogs flanked around us on the couch , @entity25 asked me to be his wife , and that very autumn , i walked down the aisle toward him with @entity14 at my side , and my best friend holding @entity72 in the front row			1
our bliss did not last long			0
the tumors came back with a vengeance , and cancer -- and its treatments -- hollowed my big , beautiful , lush - coated boy to a weak , wobbly , 85 pound skeleton covered in clumps of patchy fur , and unable hold his bowels or bladder			2
through a small , saving grace , i had a boss who was a dog lover , himself , and did his best to accommodate my working from home sometimes so @entity14 would n't have to be alone -- and because i was terrified of what we would come home to			1
explaining an animal 's death to kids a colleague with whom i was working on a project did not share my boss ' point of view			1
i tried to convey to her what was going on at home -- that every surface was covered in plastic drop cloths , and that a person - sized creature was gasping and shuddering and dying inside my house , and that i needed to hold him up while he urinated and lift his head to the water bowl			1
and that while @entity25 and i did n't and do n't have children , and these dogs are n't our children , they are our family -- our pack			0
i could not leave a single one of us alone and in pain -- and i respect that so thoroughly about @entity227 's decision			1
my entry - level advertising job was infinitesimal compared to the fandom and expectations of a whole continent , and yet she chose to stay where she was needed and care for her own			2
my boss , for the record , told the unsympathetic co-worker to back off			0
and one day it was simply all too much			0
while @entity14 had labored and wobbled and leaked , he had still managed to find some moments of peace			1
a complication from the cancer treatments left him with pneumonia in his rattling , papery lungs , and he ached through every breath			2
he summoned his strength to lift his head at his dad , and we made a phone call			0
@entity14 was too weak to walk , so @entity25 lifted him into the back of the jeep for what we knew would be the final time , and we all gathered together on the cold linoleum of the vet 's office as i bawled my heart out and @entity14 laid his head on @entity25 ' lap , grateful for the comfort			1
the shot went in , and the thing that made him @entity151 simply drained out , leaving a giant , wasted husk of a dog on the floor , and i watched @entity72 sniff it , trying to understand where her friend had gone			2
for days , she looked for him , under bushes and behind corners , sniffing in the familiar places -- and i suppose @entity25 and i were doing the same thing , too			0
it 's impossible to have a creature that physical and spiritual size in your home and not have it leave a gaping wound when it 's excised			1
i suppose that 's exactly what @entity227 was facing when she made her bold , brave and likely costly decision , and she wanted to be there to honor her beloved friend up until the very end			1
because once you get leaned on by a dog who loves you , you just ca n't help but lean right back .			2
