-- countries rarely default , at least not under the basic understanding of the term			1
if you or i ca n't pay our bills and creditors come calling , eventually we can declare bankruptcy and painfully move on			0
most of our creditors get little or nothing back			0
and companies to do it all the time -- indeed , it seems a matter of course for @entity19 airlines			1
but countries do n't really go bankrupt			1
they choose to stop paying , one way or another			0

but let 's be clear , the @entity19 was not going to default			1
the showdown was just politics			0
" the @entity19 has enormous credibility and is at no risk of default , " @entity42 , of @entity43 , told me			1
" in my view there is no possibility whatsoever of the @entity19 defaulting on its debt			1
" so , the @entity19 can not really default , thanks in part to a strong @entity54 and international creditors still wanting to buy its bonds , no matter how low the interest rate falls			1
but other countries have chosen to default , at least in theory			1
from @entity61 to @entity62 to @entity63 , countries have stopped paying the interest or principle on domestic or international obligations			1
in @entity62 's case , it was able to pay back creditors within a few years , thanks to the rise of energy prices			1
@entity62 did not walk away from its creditors			1

when it stopped paying creditors in late 2001 , it caused a great deal of pain for its citizens in 2002 - 2003			0
its efforts to settle with creditors still bubble up in @entity87 courts			0
no one can say @entity61 has fully recovered its reputation in the international markets			1
some bondholders simply refuse to take a portion of what they are owed and move on			0
they want their money back			0
still its economy grew quickly within a few years of default			2
does that mean that defaulting is not a terrible step ? after all , it means a country can get a handle on its obligations			2
" the debts become more manageable and therefore the country becomes more creditworthy , " @entity42 said			2
then , however , " the creditors pile in			0

the new government was not going to honor the obligations of the previous leaders			0
we all know how that went			0

no eurozone country has unilaterally refused to pay its bills			2
the market made it impossible for the like of @entity129 and @entity130 to issue new bonds at a sustainable interest rate			0
new creditors stepped in , instead of walking away			0
we know them as the troika -- made up of the @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139			2
@entity130 's meltdown led to bondholders taking the " haircut , " yet the country is set to take another package of aid			2
but it ca n't inflate its currency ( it lost that option when it joined the euro ) and ca n't default ( for the same reason )			2
read more : @entity19 must shake this addiction to debt -- or kill the recovery the latest plan is not the bailout , but the " bail - in			1
bond holders hold off , the depositors pay up ( those forced to bail - in ) and everyone holds their breath hoping the country can rebuild its economy and banking sector and eventually pay back something			2
after all , the troika expects to be paid back			0
if not , that would be a default			0
all this makes you wonder why the @entity19 would even want to be mentioned in the same breath or paragraph with these countries .			1

*people* and companies default -- but countries rarely do , at least in the *traditional* sense
@entity19 politicians play financial *brinkmanship* but the country was not at risk of default
other countries have defaulted -- *including* @entity61 and @entity62
and some , *history* shows , have been economically better off for having done so
