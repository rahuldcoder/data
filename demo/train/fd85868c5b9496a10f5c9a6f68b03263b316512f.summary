@entity0 -- disturbed by the news that @entity5 's wife and three children , along with some grandchildren , were able to flee over the @entity9 border to @entity10 in spite of a @entity13 travel ban , the @entity2 nonetheless is taking a low - key approach			1
" there are concerns that this is n't in keeping with the travel ban restrictions , " @entity2 spokeswoman @entity15 told reporters tuesday but , defending the administration 's response , she said the @entity23 is reviewing @entity10 's explanation for why it let the family into the country			1
@entity5 's two sons who fled , @entity28 and @entity29 , along with his daughter , @entity30 , are specifically named in the @entity13 travel ban for " closeness of association with ( the ) regime			2
" " we care , in terms of the fact that under @entity37 1970 , the @entity5 family was subject to a travel ban , " @entity15 said			1
" so , they have now traveled			0
the government of @entity10 has now sent a letter to the @entity13			0
we are reviewing that letter now in @entity43 but , clearly , there has to be an international community decision and response in regard to the travel ban restrictions that ( the resolution ) imposes			2
" the @entity10 representative to the @entity13 said monday that his government let the @entity52 into the country on " humanitarian grounds			0
" @entity55 gave birth to a daughter at the border			0
@entity10 's ambassador to the @entity13 , @entity60 , told @entity1 , " the wife of someone who has grievances with the international community is not necessarily subject to the same grievances			2
" the @entity13 resolution does allow exceptions to the travel ban resolution : " @entity69 determines on a case - by - case basis that such travel is justified on the grounds of humanitarian need , including religious obligation			0
" it requires a state to inform the @entity13 within 48 hours of any such decision			0
" we have said that members of @entity5 's family should be held accountable , " the @entity2 's @entity15 said , but added : " ... we need to review the @entity10 government explanation , so does the ( @entity79 ) , and we need to see where we go from there			1
" @entity10 's decision to accept the family , however , has infuriated the @entity85			1
the council is demanding that @entity10 authorities hand the family over to be tried by @entity9 courts , calling @entity10 's decision an " act of aggression			1
" rebels who picked through @entity95 's seaside villa in @entity9 on sunday introduced @entity1 's @entity96 to his family 's badly scarred former nanny , who said she had been doused with boiling water by @entity28 's wife , model @entity100 , when she refused to beat one of their crying toddlers			2
the abuse was corroborated by another member of the household staff .			0

@entity37 resolution *forbade* travel to the @entity5 family
@entity5 's wife , three children , some grandchildren were able to flee @entity9 into @entity10
@entity9 's @entity79 called @entity10 's decision an " act of aggression "
@entity2 : international decision is " clearly " called for in this instance
