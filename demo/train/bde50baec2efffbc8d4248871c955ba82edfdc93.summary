-- at wednesday 's announcement of @entity3 's +1 , the company was coy about comparing its experimental product to the longstanding @entity6 button			1
but in the two companies ' ongoing battle for ad dollars , +1 is a clear shot across @entity6 's bow			1
let 's follow the money for a moment			2
both companies get most of their revenue from advertising			0
they pitch their ad services based on their ability to serve highly targeted ads that get good results for brands and businesses			2
they are able to target ads based on the data they gather about users			0
but here 's the main difference : @entity6 gathers data based on user - submitted profile information			1
@entity3 has to rely on roundabout ways to get data for ad targeting			1
and some of those methods , including cookies that track browsing behavior , are coming under fire from citizens and governments			0
as you can see from the chart below , @entity3 has a lot to worry about when it comes to competing with @entity6 for ad dollars			1
@entity3 commands 12.6 % of the annual $ 10.1 billion @entity49 online ad spend ; @entity6 trumps that figure by nine full percentage points			1
new user acquisition @entity3 's +1 buttons will soon appear in @entity54 , one of the most widely used services on the @entity57			1
and clicking them will require the user to have a @entity3 profile			1
as @entity3 's @entity62 @entity61 told us in an email , " we think it 's important for users to know who they are seeing +12 s from , which is why we have the upgrade or creation of a @entity3 profile as part of the flow of a user 's first +1			1
" facebook profiles are more or less de rigeur for anyone with an internet connection			2
meanwhile , @entity79 -- and most of @entity3 's other social products , such as @entity81 -- have mostly remained in the rarefied domain of the digerati			1
making a @entity79 a requirement for those addictive little +1 buttons is a smart move on @entity3 's part			1
it may not match @entity6 's 500 million - strong membership when the feature rolls out to all users , but it has a good shot at vastly increasing levels of profile adoption			1
@entity6 's critical mass of users has been one of the things that 's allowed it to succeed in capturing more ad spend that @entity3			1
even though it is a closed , unsearchable system , @entity6 has the sheer number of users and amount of behavioral and demographic data to sweep up ad dollars no matter what			2
data gathering for ad targeting if @entity3 's +1 does lead to a larger number of @entity79 , @entity3 will have even more personal and demographic data than it currently does about web users			1
right now , @entity6 has the ability to offer extremely highly targeted ads because of the kinds of data it gathers about its users			0
it knows whether you 're single or not , it knows your gender and sexual orientation , where you work , where you live and a great deal more			0
advertisers are very excited about being able to narrow their campaigns ' scope by such finely tuned variables			0
if @entity3 could get more profiles , it could increase the accuracy of its targeting beyond keywords and browsing data , potentially matching @entity6 's level of personal relevance			1
with the push toward @entity136 features , including a new privacy bill introduced in the @entity138 , who knows how long cookie - based browsing - data gathering will last ? in short , @entity3 needs other ways to gather data to target ads , and it needs huge amounts of this data very quickly			2
what better way to do this than by introducing a compelling search product with a social prerequisite ? whether better - targeted ads from @entity3 will positively impact clickthrough rates and inspire further advertiser confidence remains to be seen			2
currently , clickthrough rates for @entity155 and @entity156 campaigns vary widely , with around 30 % of advertisers in a @entity159 survey reporting rates of 1 % or less			2
facebook ads might be underperforming the industry standard of 1 % , as well			2
socially driven recommendation engines facebook likes are already recognized by brands and businesses as a measurable marketing tool , and @entity6 itself has been embraced as a legitimate marketing platform			0
likes can act as a social recommendation engine between friends , and these recommendations count a lot when it comes to making purchase decisions			0
in fact , in a recent survey from @entity179 , 90 % of respondents said they had some degree of trust in a recommendation from a friend or family member			2
those recommendations count more than consumer reviews or branded websites			0
in other words , a @entity6 could count for more than a banner ad when it comes to moving product -- and the @entity6 is free media			0
once @entity3 has its +1 wheels in motion , the feature stands to become a social recommendation engine , as well , but a more targeted one			1
on @entity6 , you see likes for brands , photos , and posts that have nothing to do with you			0
but on @entity3 , you see personal recommendations for products and places you 're actively seeking out			2
it 's a powerful concept , and advertisers will surely want to optimize for that situation			0
@entity61 notes , " while we ca n't speak to what other products are doing , we think there 's a great deal of value in surfacing personal recommendations and endorsements where they 're most valuable , in search ... we 've really focused on relevance			0
when you +1 something , you know your friends will find it in search , but you wo n't be pushing a notification to everyone			0
" as @entity231 ceo @entity230 told us wednesday , " when someone is searching for a piece of information about a product , a review , or insightful commentary , it is typically a very insular activity , " says @entity230			0
" but being able to place a ' seal of approval ' next to a search result may have the effect of making a typically insular activity more collaborative -- hopefully improving the ' algorithm ' through the quality of your connections			0
" search algorithms the other interesting piece of the puzzle is the @entity251 question			0
@entity3 came at search in the 1990s with an algorithmic approach that put it head and shoulders above contemporary @entity258 engines			2
now , it 's turning back the clock and allowing user feedback to drive search results once again			0
does this mean algorithmic web search has failed ? will user - driven search data be just as gaming - prone as algorithms are ? @entity3 communications manager @entity266 wrote to us in an email , " we rely on a fundamentally algorithmic approach to search quality because this is the most scalable way to answer more than a billion search queries each day , many of which we 've never seen before , in more than a hundred languages			1
@entity3 's algorithm is constantly evolving and improving			1
for example , in 2010 alone we experimented with more than 6,000 changes and launched 490			0
" @entity3 will study the clicks on +1 buttons as another ranking signal			1
as with any new ranking signal , we 'll be starting carefully and learning how the signal is related to quality			0
" as users begin to see these +1s from friends and others as recommendations in search results , the results will likely become more personalized and hopefully more relevant			0
and when it comes to search , @entity6 likes -- an unindexed piece of data in a closed network -- do n't count for a hill of beans			0
who will win the war ? which company will end up with the most users , the most data , the best targeting and the most profit ? the answer to that question largely depends on whether +1 can successfully change the game , whether this innocuous little button is actually @entity3 's first killer social product			1
but regardless , online ad spend is hardly a zero sum game , and both of these companies are setting themselves up for a long - term , multilateral tug of war to capture as much of that market as possible			1

@entity3 's +1 buttons will be in @entity54 ; clicking them will require a @entity3 profile
@entity3 commands 12.6 % of the annual $ 10.1 billion in @entity49 online ad spending
if @entity3 get more people to create profiles , it could increase the accuracy of its targeting
