@entity0 -- the @entity2 discussed plans to transport non-u.s.citizens infected with @entity5 to the @entity6 for medical treatment , but decided to shelve the proposal and insists it was never considered at senior levels			1
but @entity11 @entity10 are seizing on an internal @entity2 memo outlining a possible joint state - homeland security department program to provide @entity5 care at @entity6 hospitals for non-americans			1
they say the memo is evidence the @entity18 was working on a new plan but was n't being transparent about it			0
the memo , obtained by @entity1 , is labeled " sensitive but @entity23 " and drafted by @entity2 officials			1
it recommends that the two federal agencies come up with a system to admit into the @entity6 non-citizens " as long as they are otherwise eligible for medical evacuation from the @entity5 affected countries and for entry in the @entity6			2
" it outlines the steps the @entity6 government would need to take to contract with a commercial aviation company that specializes in bio containment			0
it also mentions other non-governmental agencies the @entity6 is working with to assist with medevacing health care workers out of @entity40 to @entity42 countries			0
why @entity6 @entity5 patients seem to be recovering faster in one section the memo says the @entity6 has " an obligation to assist non-citizen employees and contractors of @entity6 agencies and programs , as well as @entity51 and private firms based in the @entity6 " @entity2 spokeswoman @entity53 dismissed the memo on wednesday as drafted by a " mid-level official , but not cleared by senior leaders			1
" saying there are " no plans " to transport non-americans who contract @entity5 in @entity40 to the @entity6 , @entity53 said the @entity6 has " discussed allowing other countries to use our medevac capabilities to evacuate their own citizens to their home countries or third countries , subject to reimbursement and availability			2
but we 're not contemplating bringing them back to the @entity6 for treatment			0
" @entity71 chairman @entity70 wrote a letter to secretary of state @entity73 and homeland security secretary @entity74 last week asking if the @entity18 was developing any plans related to non- @entity6 citizens , but complained on wednesday he has n't received a response yet			0
on wednesday he issued a written statement about the " leaked memo , " suggesting the @entity18 was trying to hide something			0
" it 's alarming that senior @entity83 officials so vehemently denied the existence of any plans to transport non- @entity6 citizens infected with @entity5 to the @entity6 for treatment when a leaked @entity2 document shows that such a proposal indeed exists and was approved by @entity83 officials , " @entity70 said			1
@entity91 hits governors for ' hiding under the covers ' from @entity5 but @entity53 said the proposal never reached senior officials for their approval			2
the copy of the memo obtained by @entity1 does not include the final page that would show specifically which officials from the @entity2 signed off on the plan			1
@entity103 @entity102 senator @entity102 also cited the memo as counter to the @entity18 's emphasis that stopping the spread of the virus means focusing on the source in @entity40			0
" the @entity91 administration memo describing possible efforts to skirt the immigration laws and fast track the admission of people with @entity5 fails to consider the risk to @entity6 and adds to the absurd refusal of the president to institute common sense travel restrictions that would better protect the homeland			1
" complete coverage on @entity5			0

@entity10 say a draft @entity2 memo shows the government could *import* *foreign* @entity5 patients
the @entity2 said the memo was just for planning
