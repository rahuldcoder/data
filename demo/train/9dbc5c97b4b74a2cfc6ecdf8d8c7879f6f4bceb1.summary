-- the day my daughter @entity2 was born , i went straight to the nursery and held her for well over two hours			1
i just held her and cried because i had never experienced such a love for anyone or anything in my life			2
i think the nurses thought i was crazy because eventually they told me i needed to go be with my wife			2
three days later , before we left the hospital , the pediatric doctor told us she thought @entity2 might have down syndrome			1
my reaction : are you freaking kidding me ? i immediately had a panic attack and was taken to the emergency room			1
thoughts were racing through my mind : how could my perfect daughter have down syndrome ? how could they not know for sure ? how could the general ultrasound , which said we had a 1 - in - 18,000 chance of having a child with @entity21 , be wrong ? why was @entity27 punishing me ? how could i live with a daughter that was going to be rejected by everyone ... including myself ? i entered into a deep depression for the first year of @entity2 's life			1
my wife became concerned about me , so i started taking antidepressants and seeing a counselor			2
i contemplated leaving my wife , or giving my daughter up for adoption , and suicide			1
i would lie awake at night thinking about my future , and searching for a reason to live			0
i believed all the negative things the world told me about @entity21 , and viewed it as a curse on my family			1
the entire time , i could n't stop thinking about how this would change my life ! @entity50 's original post on @entity51 but the truth is , i felt badly about myself			1
at one point , i wrote a letter to myself asking why things had to be this way			0
i prayed for @entity27 to take my worthless life in exchange for removing @entity2 's extra chromosome			0
i would even quietly lie awake at night contemplating how i would feel if she suddenly stopped breathing while she slept			0
finally , one saturday morning , when @entity2 was about 2 months old , i got up and told my wife i was going for a walk			1
i had no intention of coming back			0
i was going to leave my wife and daughter			1
i could n't do it anymore			0
but then , after i left , i started having second thoughts , and that 's when i remembered that my wife had signed up for an online support group			0
i ended up spending the next two hours talking on the phone about my daughter and family with a man i had never met			1
he had a 2 - year - old with @entity21			1
i can not explain it , but after talking to him for two hours i had the strength to go home and face another day			0
for the next six months , i got up and faced one day at a time			0
years ago , my father said to me , " if you want to fix a problem , then do something about it			0
" i followed his advice			0
first , i tried to gain as much knowledge as i could about raising a child with @entity21			1
next , i started calling every family i could find that had a child with @entity21			1
i owe a great deal to these families because they were willing to talk to me despite the 12 - hour time difference between @entity93 and the @entity94			0
i also started forcing myself to interact with my daughter			1
she was desperate for me to start loving her , and she continued loving me until i broke down and did the same			0
i was scared to accept my daughter because that would mean accepting her disability			1
but the reality was the only thing keeping me from loving my daughter was my own ignorance			1
once i overcame my own selfish expectations for my daughter , i slowly began to see the beautiful girl that would change my life forever			1
@entity106 : down syndrome does n't change my dreams and finally , i talked to @entity27			1
i talked to him just like he was sitting in a chair beside me because that was the true barrier in my life			0
i was honest with @entity27 throughout the entire process , and that is when i started finding peace			0
healing is a process and a journey			0
i would have never experienced this life - changing transformation if @entity2 had not been born			0
it is true , there are difficult times having a daughter with @entity21			1
but it also true that she is very much like any other child			0
@entity2 smiles , laughs , plays , is able to meet many developmental milestones ( albeit her own pace , with her own style ) , makes mistakes , and , most importantly , completes our family			2
she literally brightens my day every time i see her			0
she 's now 2 years old , and at this age all children develop at different rates			0
@entity2 can walk ; swim ; sign and speak words ; throw and kick a ball ; follow simple directions and throw tantrums			2
she also knows how to manipulate her grandparents			0
but she has not learned how to run or jump			0
she is taking thyroid medication and has a small heart defect			2
the key is , she is very similar to most toddlers her age and every child with @entity21 is different just like every child is different			1
before our summer break , she passed an entrance exam to start at a @entity151 preschool in september with her peers who are not labeled as " special - needs children			0
" in my opinion , these limitations we put on children with @entity21 are outdated and lead to a lack of acceptance in our society			1
the medical community focuses on so many of the challenges associated with @entity21 that we develop an unnecessary fear -- but these are only differences			1
the truth is , i am a better person today because of my daughter , my daughter who has down syndrome			1
i am thankful for a wife that was willing to push me to change , and support me when i struggled			2
want to respond , or got a story to share ? write a personal essay mostly , i thank @entity27 for @entity2			2
i remember praying while waiting those first two weeks to get her confirmed diagnosis : " @entity27 , if you heal my daughter , then i will give up my own salvation			2
" @entity27 did n't need my salvation -- that was a gift from him to me , just like @entity2 is a gift to us			0
the reality is that i am still saddened that @entity2 has down syndrome , but i am beginning to realize that @entity27 can bless us regardless of our circumstances			2
i will never be able to fully understand why @entity2 has down syndrome , but i do know she has made a difference in my life , my wife 's life , and in the lives of so many in our community			2
