-- by the time you read this @entity3 may have already announced it 's getting into the online - music business			1
if so , they will have plenty of company -- courtesy of some of the tech world 's biggest names			0
after days of speculation , @entity3 on friday rolled out a web page for @entity14			1
of course , it was a page that did n't do anything , but sent a pretty clear signal that the much speculated - about service was about to become a reality			0
( the prevailing theory late friday was that it would go live over the weekend , in conjunction with the @entity23 music festival			0
) early reports suggest the service will let users listen to the songs that are trending as most popular on @entity3 and elsewhere on the @entity28			2
and it would be only one of several music - streaming services to either be introduced recently or rumored to be in the works			1
and it 's not just startups with names like @entity36 any more			0
@entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 are among the major players now in the mix. why are so many @entity43 titans getting into the game ? the answer is simple : dollars and cents			1
online streaming , by which users listen to music either for free or for a monthly fee , is the fastest growing form of music listening , according to industry reports			2
the @entity53 , in its annual report , said that while overall music sales were down in 2012 , digital - music sales were up 14 % , topping $ 4 billion			2
" digital growth was driven by large increases in revenues through what can broadly be referred to as ' access models , ' where users can choose to listen from large libraries of music rather than purchasing individual songs or albums , " the report read			0
at the top of that heap are sites like @entity71 and @entity72			1
@entity71 lets users give it suggestions , then creates a personalized radio station			2
@entity72 lets users pick exactly what they want to listen to out of a library of more than 16 million songs			2
both make money either through ads or by letting users pay a monthly fee to go ad - free			1
@entity72 has made no bones about its desire to make even the @entity38 @entity88 model for digital music obsolete			1
why pay for music when you can listen to virtually anything you want to hear for free ( or for a modest fee ) , they ask ? ( some musical artists would say because it helps them make a living wage , instead of fractions of a penny for each of their songs played			0
) for the first time , royalties earned from digital - music services in the @entity105 just surpassed licensing revenues from radio broadcasts			1
and digital streaming is growing particularly fast among younger users			0
a @entity112 research poll from august suggested that teens now discover and listen to music on @entity115 more often than on the radio , @entity88 or @entity117 " the accessibility of music has seen tremendous expansion and diversification , " said @entity118 , a @entity112 senior vice president			0
" while younger listeners opt for technologically advanced methods , traditional methods of discovery like radio and word - of - mouth continue to be strong drivers			0
" here 's a closer look at the heavyweights hoping to get their share of the increasingly lucrative music market			2
twitter on thursday , music - discovery company we are @entity137 confirmed reports that it had been bought out by @entity3			1
instantly gone from the @entity43 , we are @entity137 would search blogs , social media and other sites for new music that was picking up serious buzz and add it to a constantly updated stream			0
one would assume @entity3 plans something similar			2
" we ca n't wait to share what we 've been working on at @entity3 , " reads a message on the now - closed hunted site			1
" we wish we could say ( what it is ) , but we 're not yet ready to talk about it			0
you 'll hear more from us when we are			0
" @entity157 turned " @entity159 " host @entity158 praised the app on @entity3 on thursday , saying it " shows what artists are trending , also has up and coming artists			0
" the official rollout could happen at @entity23 on saturday , though @entity3 did not respond to a request for comment and had not confirmed that as of friday afternoon			0
@entity38 reports have suggested that @entity38 , which already lets @entity88 users listen to their own music libraries , is also eyeing the streaming - music space			1
last month , reports surfaced that ceo @entity171 had met with @entity172 , founded by hip - hop producer @entity173 and music - industry stalwart @entity174			0
the maker of the popular " @entity172 " and other headphones announced in january that it had begun " @entity177 , " a music - subscription service			1
@entity180 , an @entity38 executive who played a major role in creating @entity88 , also attended the meeting , @entity179 quoted three unnamed sources as saying			0
in its announcement of @entity187 , @entity184 said the service would be released in late 2013 and " bring an emotional connection back to the act of music discovery			0
" @entity37 @entity37 , meanwhile , is reportedly working to expand the already wide reach of @entity115 in the @entity28 music world			1
for young listeners , @entity115 is already a massive music - discovery and listening tool			0
and , like @entity38 , @entity37 provides virtual lockers for users to store and listen to their own music on multiple devices			1
@entity37 's service would reportedly let users subscribe to expanding streaming options			1
the company would n't confirm its plans on the record , but did n't shoot them down , either			0
" while we do n't comment on rumor or speculation , there are some content creators that think they would benefit from a subscription revenue stream in addition to ads , so we 're looking at that , " said a spokesperson for @entity115 , which @entity37 owns			2
@entity39 here 's the major player that 's already in the game			1
@entity221 was introduced in october			1
it 's offered across a full range of @entity39 products , including the @entity225 , and uses the increasingly familiar ad - supported or ad - free for a fee model			1
while @entity39 flailed with its attempt at an @entity231 competitor , the @entity230 , the tech giant has been far more successful pushing the @entity232 as an all - in - one entertainment device , not just a gaming console .			2

@entity3 is the latest web player to get into music streaming
ad - or - subscription streaming services like @entity72 , @entity71 are booming
@entity38 , @entity37 and @entity3 all reportedly will roll out music services
@entity39 's @entity221 feature was introduced in october
