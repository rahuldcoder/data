@entity0 -- when @entity4 's @entity3 opens thursday in the @entity5 , guests will be in for a slew of magical moments , and they 'll have plenty of room to enjoy them			1
this portion of the park nearly doubled in size , making it the largest expansion in the park 's 41 - year history			1
" it gives guests another level of immersion , " says @entity17 , chairman of @entity18			2
" we have technology to play with that @entity24 did n't have			2
" for instance , part of the expansion includes @entity29 's @entity28 , which sits atop @entity30			1
during lunch hours , guests order at touch - screen kiosks and take radio - frequency devices to their tables			2
once the pager is placed on the table , servers know exactly where to deliver the food			0
and voila , meals arrive within minutes via a glass - enclosed cart			0
" everything is fresh , made to order , and for lunch we are hoping for the bustling kind of energy like the movie scene ( from ' @entity50 ' ) in the dining room , " says @entity43 , @entity4 executive chef			1
in the evening , the restaurant transforms into fancy table - service dining , inviting guests to feast upon @entity56 onion soup , mussels @entity57 and charcuterie while sipping on @entity56 wines and beers			1
this is a first , since alcohol has never been served before in the @entity5			1
in true @entity65 style , the decor inside and out is over the top			0
from the chandeliers to the walls to the terrazzo floor to the draperies , it 's all true to the movie			1
even suits of armor that whisper to passersby line the hallway			0
guests then make their way into the grand ballroom , which has an entire wall of arched windows , complete with magical snowflakes falling upon the @entity56 countryside			0
@entity84 , from @entity85 , @entity86 , appreciates the extreme theming			0
" i felt like a kid again entering ( @entity30 ) , " she says			0
" it completely recreates the details of @entity29 's @entity91 to the most minute aspect			2
" other areas of @entity3 involve similar attention to detail , completely immersing guests in the beloved @entity65 stories			1
the expansion , which has been in the works for more than three years , introduces two new areas --- - the @entity101 , which focuses on @entity50 and @entity102 , and @entity103 , an area inspired by the @entity65 animated feature " @entity106			1
" have you been to @entity3 ? share your images major focus on character time outside , to the far left of @entity29 's @entity28 is @entity111 , a provincial abode that houses an enchanted mirror			1
it spectacularly transforms into a portal whisking guests into the story of @entity50			1
once in the @entity29 's library , @entity118 with @entity119 goes way beyond a typical meet and greet when @entity119 and friends invite guests to help act out the " tale as old as time			2
" next door at prince @entity91 , kids and adults alike will enjoy under the @entity130 ( almost identical to the @entity132 version )			0
after walking through an interactive queue , guests board giant clamshells as animation and animatronics retell @entity139 's story			2
afterward in @entity141 , guests score one - on - one time with the redheaded mermaid herself as she poses for photos and signs autographs			0
" for us , the @entity3 expansion was more than we could have imagined , " @entity148 says			1
" it was like being immersed in the stories of @entity119 and @entity139 , not just visiting attractions			0
" @entity148 and her family were also impressed with @entity103 , which opened over the summer			0
this portion of the park includes a water play area , tame roller coaster and gift shop			0
the revamped @entity106 ride , with its new indoor queue lounge , is a crowd pleaser for parents who want to sit down for a bit and children who want to enjoy an elaborate playground			0
guests receive a pager that virtually holds their place in line ; it lights up when it 's time to board the ride			2
another option is to grab a fastpass and wait in a traditional line outdoors			0
overall , the new additions certainly have @entity65 fans aflutter , but will this translate to an influx of @entity0 visitors ? @entity180 , chief marketing officer for @entity0 , thinks so			0
" when any major new attraction opens in @entity0 , there 's always a positive impact in terms of increased awareness and interest in the destination , " she says			1
" with new @entity3 being the largest expansion in @entity5 history , we are certainly optimistic that it will impact visitation for 2013 and beyond			1
" coming soon princess @entity193 is scheduled to open in 2013 in the former home of @entity196 's scary adventures			2
located in the @entity198 in the center of @entity3 , it will be a place for guests to meet @entity65 princess characters			1
come early 2014 , the finishing touch will be a roller coaster , the @entity204 , in the heart of it all			0
this family thrill ride will be an experience somewhere in between the tame @entity209 , a re-themed " beginner 's coaster , " and the classic @entity212			2
with its patented train of vehicles that swing back and forth , the attraction will be the first of its kind			0
