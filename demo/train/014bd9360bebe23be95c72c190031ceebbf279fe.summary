@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 sunday launched a special tribunal to prosecute the assassins of former @entity1 prime minister @entity6			1
a statue of slain former @entity1 prime minister @entity6 stands in @entity0			1
the tribunal convened at the @entity9 more than four years after @entity6 was killed in a massive car bombing in @entity0 on february 14 , 2005			1
the bomb , detonated as @entity6 's armored motorcade passed through @entity0 's fashionable seaside @entity14 district , contained hundreds of pounds of explosives			2
it left buildings shattered and streets littered with the mangled wreckage of vehicles			0
the blast also killed 22 other people			0
the @entity1 army was out in force on the streets of @entity0 sunday as people turned out to pay their respects to @entity6 , who is buried downtown in the @entity1 capital			1
the @entity3 tribunal will have 11 judges , whose identities are being kept secret for their safety			1
the prosecution could take as long as 10 years , sources close to the tribunal said			0
four senior @entity1 generals are being held over the bombing , which also killed 22 other people			2
but many @entity1 -- as well as the @entity41 and @entity3 investigators -- believe @entity42 ordered the assassination			1
the tribunal 's prosecutor , @entity45 , refused to commit when asked at a news conference sunday if @entity42 would be charged			0
he said the public would have to wait and see			0
the @entity49 pledged its continued support of @entity1 judicial authorities and the tribunal 's operations			0
the @entity41 has promised to contribute $ 14 million ; a request for an additional $ 6 million is pending approval from @entity56			0
in a statement issued sunday , acting @entity49 spokesman @entity57 said @entity6 's death " was an unsuccessful attempt to undermine @entity1 's sovereignty			2
" he added : " the @entity1 people answered his assassination with the @entity64 , leading to the withdrawal of @entity42 troops and the most democratic @entity1 elections in decades			2
" at the time of @entity6 's death , neighboring @entity42 had immense political influence in the country , and had maintained troops in its smaller neighbor since the 1980s , after the fighting between @entity73 and the @entity74 in @entity1			1
@entity6 was admired for spearheading the rebuilding of @entity0 after the country 's civil war , from 1975 to 1990 , and many @entity1 blamed @entity42 for the killing , citing @entity6 's patriotism and strong sense of @entity1 independence			1
the killing sparked widespread protests that led to the eventual withdrawal of @entity42 troops from @entity1 and the election of an @entity87 bloc in parliament			1
the @entity87 movement is known as the @entity87 , named after the day millions of supporters of @entity6 took to the streets , and its actions have been dubbed the @entity64 , for the nation 's iconic cedar trees			0
huge counter-protests also were staged by @entity1 supporters of @entity42			2
along the way , @entity3 investigators tasked to probe the attack found links between @entity42 's government and @entity6 's assassination			1
the @entity1 hope the tribunal will settle the case , but there are also fears it could further divide the nation and open up older wounds in the country			0
the special tribunal takes over from the @entity0 - based @entity111 , which looked into 20 other attacks and found elements linking some of them to a criminal network behind the @entity6 killing , the @entity3 said			1
the trial will take place in a converted gymnasium in a suburb of the @entity9			0
the @entity3 says the case is expected to be ready for trial by 2010			0
