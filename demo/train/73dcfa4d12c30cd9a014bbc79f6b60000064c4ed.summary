-- sometimes it seems that @entity5 , despite being one of the richest cities on earth , is uncertain of its identity : much of its new architecture is heavily influenced by @entity10 examples rather than a desert or @entity13 vernacular			2
@entity15 designer @entity14 aims to change that			1
" some of the parks that have existed here have been based on the romantic notion of a @entity10 park			2
it 's as if someone went to @entity29 and said , ' ooh , that 's a nice park , ' and rolled it up and dropped it on top of the desert , " notes @entity14 , the @entity15 designer of the @entity22 and @entity24 cauldron and the @entity26 bus			1
@entity14 is hoping to renew the @entity37 capital 's pride of place			1
his weapon of choice ? a cracked , underground park that embraces both the natural aesthetic and flora indigenous to the land			0
" there can be a mentality that can easily exist here that sees the desert as a surface to be covered up , instead of maybe celebrating its uniqueness , " says @entity14 , who recently unveiled plans for proposed 1.3 - million - square - foot @entity45			1
on the outside , the public space will resemble a 65 - feet high mound of parched earth			0
@entity14 imagines it as a space where residents will congregate to picnic , or catch an outdoor concert			1
underneath the dome ( which is really a patchwork of canopies held up by several columns ) will live lush gardens ( including date palms and a community vegetable patch ) , streams and pools , cafes , and a public library			1
" the amazing thing about living in a city , in a place where people live in close proximity to each other , are those times when you want to see your fellow citizens , when you want to be amongst them and have your mind move forward , " @entity14 notes			1
" unlike in @entity86 , where you can go for a walk down the street , the extreme climate in @entity5 limits your options			0
that kind of socializing tends to happen mainly in shopping malls , " explains @entity14			2
@entity45 , he hopes , will be offer the city 's residents a viable alternative			2
the domed park will also give the otherwise flat city an undulating quality			0
" it 's almost two stories in the middle			0
it 's almost like @entity5 's first hill , " he says			0
to reduce the nation 's carbon footprint , @entity14 has also opted to mix concrete from desert sand , eliminating the need to rely on imports			1
furthermore , the shade provided by the rooftop will also reduce the amount of desalinated water needed to irrigate the plants underneath by restricting evaporation			0
" the partial shade will mean we can use half the quantity of water that the current site used , and create more lushness in the process , " he says .			0

@entity15 designer @entity14 recently unveiled plans for @entity45

underneath , the park will have pools , streams and lush community gardens
