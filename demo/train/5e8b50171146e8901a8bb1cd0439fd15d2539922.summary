-- before the start of @entity4 's civil war , you could count the number of newspapers in the country on one hand and all were heavily controlled by the government			1
now there are 120 independent newspapers in the city of @entity14 alone , according to local journalists			1
these newspapers are mostly run and staffed by engineers , doctors and students , said @entity20 , one of several foreign organizations that is helping train journalists in @entity4			1
one , called " @entity24 " -- " @entity25 " in @entity26 -- was launched by five medical , engineering and economics students in their early 20s in february			1
it began as an eight - page magazine , now increased to 12 pages and selling 3,000 copies a week across eastern @entity4 and beyond			1
one of the editors , @entity35 , a 22 - year - old civil engineering student , said : " at the time there was no email or mail service , so we put a physical box in @entity40 and made a sign telling people they could post contributions to our newspaper			2
" within 10 days we had tens of articles , which we edited and printed in the first issue of the paper , " he added			2
the magazine had no source of income , so the editors put charity boxes on streets for contributions			2
in 10 days they had raised enough money to pay for the first print run of 2,000 copies			1
the eight - page magazine included four color pages			2
many other people eager to make their voices heard when @entity62 lost control of the city in february set up their own newspapers			1
while it may seem surprising for newspapers to be flourishing in an internet age , @entity4 's uprising was not conducted as much through social media sites as those in @entity71 and other @entity73 countries			1
internet penetration in @entity4 is just 5.5 % , according to the @entity75 , an agency of the @entity76 that focuses on the internet and communications			1
in addition there were frequent internet blackouts after the uprising began in february			1
the cause of the blackouts was not clear , but a regular connection was not restored until august			2
@entity86 , local coordinator for @entity20 in @entity14 , said : " before the uprising we had five newspapers in the whole country and they were just mouthpieces of the government			1
" all they had been doing was supporting @entity62 's word , glorifying his personality and trying to eliminate anything else			2
" after the revolution we had all these new newspapers taking the opposite view -- but it is not totally professional			1
" in the beginning all they did was attack @entity62			2
it was like someone writing on his @entity106 page			0
the articles had no structure , they were not informative , they took one side but never both sides , there were never any quotes			0
" @entity86 , a 25 - year - old engineering student , has himself been on a steep learning curve since the start of this year			0
he started to work as an interpreter when foreign journalists arrived in @entity14 and decided to train as a journalist on the job			1
" i started going out with the crews and tried to learn their craft , " said @entity86			0
" the foreign journalists have been teaching me			1
they write a piece , and i write a piece and they tell me what 's wrong with mine			0
" @entity86 began submitting articles to local newspapers and made a radio documentary			1
he said : " i submitted my first article to a local newspaper about military camps			0
i was really embarrassed to show it to anyone , but the editor was totally in love with it and asked me to keep giving them articles			0
" i made a radio documentary called ' @entity142 ' about @entity62 's secret police for a local station			0
" nobody here really knows what a radio documentary is , but a lot of people loved it			0
here in @entity4 there 's a social stigma , we do n't talk about things we fear , but i managed to get people to talk			1
" @entity157 , a media expert for @entity20 , a @entity159 organization , made his first mission to @entity14 in june , and set up a permanent office there in august			1
he recruited @entity86 as a local media coordinator to monitor the state of the media and write regular reports about the content and quality of radio stations , newspapers and the growing number of satellite television channels			1
the organization has run workshops and courses for local journalists on conflict reporting			1
it has also held a two - day workshop for 100 journalists all over the eastern part of @entity4 in the city of @entity180			1
the organization plans to move into @entity181 as soon as it is safe to do so			0
" in @entity14 , 80 % of people starting up newspapers are engineers because it 's the center for the oil refineries , " said @entity157			1
" it 's amazing to see how hungry people are for knowledge			0
" he knows that not all the newspapers can survive , but hopes those that do will become more professional			1
@entity86 said that is already starting to happen			0
" i 'm quite optimistic , " he said			0
" i read newspapers and nowadays people are providing analysis and holding the politicians to account			1
" some of the new government are still trying to control the media , but the journalists are resisting that			1
some journalists now have contracts with foreign television channels from @entity205 , @entity206 or @entity207			2
" @entity86 added : " the biggest obstacle to the local media is financial sustainability			0
people are just paying to produce the newspapers out of their own pockets and the market is too loaded with 120 newspapers			1
people do n't know what to buy			0
" most of the newspapers will die out and a few good ones will survive			2
" the content of " @entity24 " too has changed in the eight months since it launched			2
@entity35 said : " at the beginning we had six pages of reader articles , and we simply edited them for language			0
" now we only have two or three pages from readers and we have a couple of professional writers			0
we cover social and political events , social problems , interviews with military and rebel leaders			0
" we now get contributions through @entity106 and we will be publishing on the internet so people abroad can read us			0
" @entity35 hopes that " @entity24 " will be one of the newspapers that can become sustainable			2
" we have started to carry advertising , " he said			0
" we know it 's a hard time now and we have to focus and work hard to win the crowds over			0
it helps that we got in early and built up a base of readers very fast			0
" @entity35 still has another year of his studies and plans to become a civil engineer , but believes he can continue to publish " @entity249 " alongside his other work			0
@entity86 is still undecided about becoming a full - time journalist and is juggling several career options and responsibilities			0
in addition to work for @entity20 , @entity86 is volunteering in a blood bank , helping out at a local hospital , and acting as a guide and facilitator for a rehabilitation center for fighters with physical , mental and psychological scars from the war			2
" and i 'm still a student preparing for my final project , " he said			0
" i 'm busy doing all kinds of things and i 'm really shattered			0
