@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 psychiatrist defending himself against charges that he killed 13 people in a shooting rampage at @entity0 , @entity1 , concluded his case on wednesday without calling a single witness			1
maj. @entity10 ended days of speculation over whether he would take the stand with three words : " the defense rests			1
" closing arguments were scheduled to begin thursday morning before the case is handed to a military jury , which will determine whether @entity10 is guilty of 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder in connection with the november 5 , 2009 , attack			1
it was unclear if @entity10 , who faces the death penalty if convicted , planned to deliver a closing statement			1
@entity0 victims feel betrayed @entity10 's decision not to offer a defense was an anticlimactic end to the testimony portion of a court - martial where prosecution witnesses , primarily survivors , painted a horrific picture of what unfolded inside the processing center during the attack			1
inside the courtroom , the liaison for the family members of those killed handed out packages of @entity43 ahead of the day 's proceeding			0
as they have nearly every day of the trial , some of the wives and mothers of the 12 soldiers and one civilian killed had their eyes fixed -- some in a cold stare -- on @entity10			1
there is no question about whether @entity10 carried out the shooting rampage as he took credit for it at the outset of the trial , telling the jury of 13 senior officers during opening statements that the evidence will show " i was the shooter			1
" the judge , col. @entity65 , has refused to allow @entity10 to argue " defense of others , " a claim that he carried out the shootings to protect the @entity69 @entity68 and its leaders from @entity72 soldiers			1
is @entity10 's strategy martyrdom ? much has been made of @entity10 's defense or , as his stand - by attorneys have said , the lack of it			2
the judge declined a request by @entity10 's attorneys to drop out of the case			2
the attorneys argued that @entity10 was helping the prosecution put him to death			2
there may be something to that claim			0
the judge barred @entity10 from pleading guilty at the start of the court - martial			2
under military law , defendants can not enter guilty pleas in capital punishment cases			0
in recent weeks , he has leaked documents through his civilian attorney to the @entity98 and @entity99 that appear to offer a glimpse of @entity10 's justification for carrying out the attack			1
the documents included a mental health evaluation conducted by a military panel to determine whether @entity10 was fit to stand trial			1
" i do n't think what i did was wrong because it was for the greater cause of helping my @entity114 brothers , " he told the panel , according to pages of the report published by the @entity98			0
he also said , according to the documents : " i 'm paraplegic and could be in jail for the rest of my life			0
however , if i died by lethal injection i would still be a martyr			0
" military prosecutors called 89 witnesses and submitted more than 700 pieces of evidence before resting their case , hoping to show that the @entity72 - born @entity114 had undergone what they described as a progressive radicalization			0
@entity10 challenges witness account of shooting they have argued to the jury that @entity10 , who was scheduled to deploy to @entity69 , did not want to fight against other @entity114 and believed he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible			2
over the course of 11 days , prosecution witnesses painted a horrific picture of the shooting rampage that began inside the deployment center , with a number recounting how the gunman rose from a chair , shouted " @entity141 " -- @entity142 for " @entity143 is the greatest " -- and fired more than 146 rounds in the room			0
the prosecution witnesses called tuesday described the final minutes of the attack , a police shootout that ended with the gunman shooting a police officer before he was shot			0
@entity10 was paralyzed from the chest down			0
the final witness called by the prosecution , dr. @entity151 , testified about what @entity10 told her would happen to the @entity4 if he were deployed			1
" the last thing he said ... ' they will pay , " @entity151 said			0
fast facts : soldier - on - soldier attacks military death row : more than 50 years and no executions			0
