organizational confusion , gaps in training , a series of communication failures and more allowed @entity5 to jump a fence and enter the @entity7 in a september incident that led to the @entity11 director 's resignation			1
the @entity12 published an in - depth review of the failures that allowed @entity5 to run past several agents and burst into the first family 's residence			1
deputy homeland security secretary @entity19 ' findings were made public thursday after lawmakers were briefed on its findings			0
the report details alarm and radio systems that did n't work as planned , a chase foiled when @entity5 disappeared into the bushes , and an officer who was supposed to release canines trained to take down intruders who reacted 11 seconds late because he was in a van talking on his personal cell phone , without his radio earpiece in place and with his second radio in his locker			1
the canine officer " gave @entity5 the required verbal warning about the canine , caught a glimpse of @entity5 heading toward the bushes , and gave his canine the command to apprehend @entity5 , " the review said			1
" the canine , however , did not have enough time to lock onto @entity5 and may not have seen @entity5 at all , " it said			2
the review offered a particularly grim look at the @entity11 's communications systems , which it said prevented some officers from being notified that a man had jumped the @entity7 's fence			1
" a combination of technical missteps , lack of radio discipline , improper use of equipment and aging infrastructure , " as well as an improper setting on the @entity11 's radio system , contributed to those problems , it said			1
the officers who activated the @entity11 's emergency communication system did n't provide the necessary details of the incident over that system -- and even if they had , some key posts had muted their receivers			1
the review also pointed to time cut from the understaffed @entity11 's training programs , saying officers had n't received instruction on how to handle intruders who did n't appear to be armed			1

a @entity7 official confirmed that the review of the incident is complete			1
rep. @entity88 , a @entity90 @entity89 , said the report shows the @entity11 was " significantly hampered " by " critical and major failures in communications , confusion about operation protocols , and gaps in staffing and training			2
" " while some of these problems can be attributed to a lack of resources , others are systemic and indicative of @entity11 culture , " @entity88 said			2
the incident led to the resignation of @entity11 director @entity107			1
her interim replacement , @entity110 , was seen having breakfast with agents , including the special agent in charge of president @entity116 's protective detail , on thursday morning			2
the bulk of the review of the september 19 incident focuses on the period after 7:19 p.m. , when @entity5 climbed the fence at a spot where an ornamental spike was missing , ignored the instructions of two officers outside the fence on @entity126 to stop and ran onto the @entity7 's @entity127			1
two more officers pointed their rifles at @entity5 but chose not to fire , because they believed he was n't armed			2
then they lost him in the bushes on the @entity7 's @entity130			0
the officers said they were " surprised that @entity5 was able to get through the bushes ; prior to that evening , the officers believed the bushes too thick to be passable			0
" the canine officer , meanwhile , missed the radio alerts			2
official : @entity11 twice interviewed , released @entity5 an officer parked behind the canine officer could n't see past the 6 - to 8 - foot tall bushes and trees on the north grounds			1
" by the time the officer exited his vehicle and began yelling commands at @entity5 , @entity5 had nearly arrived at the bushes , " the review said			2
" the officer was unable to reach @entity5 before he entered the bushes and , as a result , went around the bushes toward the @entity130 only to find that @entity5 had already entered the @entity7			0
" the officer posted outside the @entity130 doors of the @entity7 heard " unintelligible traffic over the radio " and " pointed his weapon at @entity5 , put his finger on the trigger , and ordered him to get down			0
" " @entity5 did not obey , but the officer did not see any indication that @entity5 was armed or presented a threat warranting the use of lethal force , " the review said			0
" the officer saw that the wooden mansion doors were closed and assumed that they were locked and that @entity5 would be cornered between him " and other officers and canines			0
the doors were n't locked			0
the officer stationed behind those doors was knocked backward when @entity5 burst through as she was trying to lock them			0
she tried twice to take @entity5 down but failed " because of the size disparity between the two			0
" she tried to use her baton , but accidentally grabbed her flashlight instead			0
she threw it down , grabbed her gun and continued to order @entity5 to stop , as he ignored her and briefly entered the @entity79			0
that 's when an officer inside the @entity7 and down the hall " managed to bring @entity5 to the ground in the center hallway			0
" two agents who had just finished their shifts ran to help , and together they pinned down and handcuffed @entity5 .			0
