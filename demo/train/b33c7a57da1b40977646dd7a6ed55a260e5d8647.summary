-- not many opponents have come close to beating @entity2 in recent months , but the tennis star had to overcome her own " super crazy " hair to win her first match since claiming double @entity8 glory			1
the world @entity9 continued her imperious recent run with a 6 - 3 6 - 4 win against @entity15 qualifier @entity13 at the @entity17 's @entity16 for her 35th victory in 36 singles matches			1
@entity2 has won singles and doubles @entity8 gold at @entity23 and the @entity24 since being crowned @entity26 champion for a fifth time last month			1
however , the second seed was left frustrated after making 44 unforced errors against @entity13 on tuesday as she began preparations for another tilt at her home @entity33 later this month			1
@entity34 gets golden slam " that 's shocking			1
hopefully i clean up my act for my next match , " the 30 - year - old told the @entity17 's website ahead of her last - 16 clash with either @entity42 's @entity41 or @entity45 qualifier @entity43 -- who she beat in the last 16 at @entity26			1
on her hairstyle , @entity2 remarked : " i need to calm it down			1
it was a little windy , so it was getting in my face , and i put it in this ' 80s scrunchie i happened to have			2
" the look is n't new			2
i 've just let it go super natural and super crazy and not care			1
" opinion : why focus on @entity61 ' hair ? @entity2 has won 66 singles and doubles titles in her career , but the 14 - time grand slam champion was a little unsure about where @entity16 featured in her resume			1
" i 've won this tournament			2
when it was n't this big			2
but it counts , " the @entity71 said before reconsidering			2
" i did win this tournament , did n't i ? " maybe i did n't			0
i ca n't keep up			0
i do n't think i did			0
yeah , i did n't win this tournament			0
i really thought i did			0
" @entity2 ' older sister @entity74 , her gold medal - winning doubles partner at @entity23 , is also yet to win the hard - court tournament			1
the former world no. 1 has struggled in recent years with injury and illness , having been diagnosed with @entity81 during last year 's @entity33			1
but the wild - card entrant battled past @entity84 's 12th seed @entity85 6 - 3 6 - 7 ( 5 - 7 ) 6 - 2 in her first - round match before discussing her ongoing health problems and her ambition to play in a fifth @entity8 in 2016			1
" i 'm trying different things all the time , " said the 32 - year - old seven - time grand slam winner			0
" i keep working with my doctors			0
" nothing can prevent bad days , but the bad days are n't as bad as they used to be			0
now i realize i have to hang in there if i 'm not having the best day			0
my main goal is to be 100 % , but it 's not like it goes away			2
" it 's still in my body trying to fight against me , but i 'm fighting against it as well ... i ca n't wait until @entity99			2
i 'm very excited about @entity99			0
that will probably be my last one			0
by that time i 'll be creeping up in age			0
" @entity102 , who beat @entity2 in last year 's @entity33 final to win her first grand slam title , survived a spirited fightback from @entity107 's @entity106 to win 6 - 3 6 - 7 ( 6 - 8 ) 6 - 4 in @entity16 and also reach the last 16			1
the third seed let match point slip in a second - set tie - break and fell 4 - 0 behind in the decider before rallying to win six games in a row			1
" it was an interesting third set considering the whole match was really quite close , " said the @entity114			2
" there were no breaks in the second set , and then straight away i got myself in quite a hole quite quickly			0
" i thought i could still regroup and close that gap just a little bit , and if you do that , you never know what can happen			0
i got on a roll and managed to squeeze it out			0
" in the men 's tournament , 2003 @entity33 champion @entity128 is out after injuring his back during a 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) 6 - 3 defeat to @entity135 lucky loser @entity133			1
the former world no. 1 now faces a race against time to fit for the @entity139 grand slam			0
" i just had a little bit of a back issue the other day in practice , " the 29 - year - old told the @entity142 's website			1
" i was supposed to play yesterday and we had a late request to delay it			0
i felt fine early on , and then i had one lunge forehand and , we have all had it , your back kind of goes out or spasms a little bit			2
" meanwhile , @entity71 10th seed @entity152 began his campaign with a straight - sets win over @entity157 @entity156 , while his compatriot @entity158 set up a meeting with @entity161 's defending champion @entity160 -- the @entity8 singles gold medalist -- by beating @entity164 's @entity163			1
