by day , @entity0 works from home for a company based in @entity3 , selling stationery and school supplies to @entity7 big - box retailers			1
in the afternoon , he rides a bus about 30 minutes from @entity9 , @entity10 , to a studio where he makes small leather goods by hand in the hopes of one day selling them for his own company			1
before he can do that , though , he figures he needs to know how to use a sewing machine and make a scalable product			2
" i want to be the guy selling stuff to @entity27 companies instead of selling for them , " said @entity0 , 35 , whose background is product development , sales and retail branding			0
" i want to make a name for myself , but even if i have a product that 's successful and great , how cool would it be if i could also say that i sew my own product ? " to get closer to his dream , @entity0 enrolled in a " sewing and production specialist " course at @entity35 in @entity36 , where he 'll learn the basics of sewing in an industrial setting and the production process			1
the program includes on - the - job training and a paid internship with a company in the @entity48 region that could lead to a full - time job			1
upon completion of the 22 - week program , which began in january , he 'll earn a certificate in industrial sewing through @entity54			1
it may not sound like the sexiest gig ever , but @entity0 is one of 18 students who see the program as a ticket to a brighter future			0
ranging in age from 18 to 64 , their reasons for joining are as varied as their backgrounds			2
some are lifelong @entity65 , but nearly half are legal immigrants from as far as @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			0
some of them want to make use of a skill they utilized in their homeland or find a steady job that keeps them off their feet ; others , such as @entity0 , see a path to entrepreneurialism			2
made in @entity7 markets create communities of like - minded consumers that the class exists is a testament to the growing demand for a trade considered nearly obsolete in the last decades of the 20th century			1
the last time @entity54 offered a cutting and sewing class was in the 1940s before it was dropped because of a lack of industry demand , said @entity95 , dean of workforce training and continuing education			1
fast forward six decades and the demand for a skilled cut and sew industry has returned to @entity10 , home to about 8,000 manufacturing companies , many in desperate need of a workforce trained in trades lost in an era of outsourcing and automation			1

" companies are looking for people with the right skills and people want to recareer and get back into the work force , and they want to do it quickly			1
" birth of a movement sure , there are online sewing tutorials and workshops at community centers or crafts stores for hobbyists			1
colleges also offer degrees in fashion design and manufacturing and apparel technology			0
but organizers of the course say its specific focus on skilled sewing certification makes it unique -- and cheaper for students since it 's not a course for credits			1
the genesis of the course also makes it unique			2
representatives from companies that historically manufactured in @entity10 got together in january 2012 and realized they had a shared need for skilled labor that could work with a variety of materials , from clothing and shoes to medical supplies , tarps , banners and hvac vents			1
spearheaded by @entity159 , ceo of luggage maker @entity160 , the coalition moved fast once it identified common goals , reaching out to @entity54 to create a curriculum suiting their needs and @entity165 , a nonprofit human services organization that helps job seekers			1
thus was born the @entity167 , which bills itself as " a hands - on movement to rebuild the industrial sewing heritage of @entity7 " through the collaborative efforts of businesses and industry , educational institutions and nonprofits			1
the coalition represents a variety of sectors : established accessory and apparel brands like @entity160 , @entity181 and @entity182 ; independent designers of bridal collections , dance recital costumes and lingerie ; cut and sew facilities and makers of industrial sewing machines			2
the story of @entity160 , a heritage brand that has been making bags and accessories in its @entity9 facility for more than 100 years , mirrors the experience of other coalition members			0
the brand relies on a skilled workforce that 's rapidly approaching retirement age in a time when it has begun to see dramatic growth , thanks to swelling brand awareness and interest in @entity7 - made goods			1
made in @entity7 : the short list " the more we 've grown , the more we 've found it very , very difficult to find skilled labor to stay at capacity , " @entity159 said			2
" we lost a whole generation of skilled labor , so we have to jump - start training again			1
we 're the guardians of our trade and , if we do n't , it will go away			0
" the coalition has a nonprofit arm that provides partial funding for scholarships and materials for the course			0
additional funding for scholarships , which 16 of the 18 students receive , came from a $ 75,000 grant awarded to @entity165 from the @entity226 's @entity225			0
beyond training a skilled workforce , @entity159 says the larger vision for the coalition is to create a cut and sew industry in the @entity48 that compares to those in @entity233 and @entity234			1
but to do so , it needs to convince people that these are n't dead - end jobs -- that they have opportunities for advancement , especially as current workers retire			2
a chance to start fresh the program has its share of creative types in their 20s and 30s looking for alternatives to corporate life			2
@entity249 , 34 , already has a full - time job in web design			1
she decided to enroll in the program 's night classes so she 'd have a skill that would allow her to potentially change careers			0
" i want to actually be able to sew in way that i can produce something from the production standpoint instead of just creating a one - off , " she said			2
other students are approaching middle age and looking for a chance to start fresh			0
@entity263 , 47 , has held his share of jobs in telecommunications and the service industry ; in darker days , he served time in prison for robbery			0
but , that 's all behind him , he says			0
now , he 's engaged and has monthly bills , child support and a daughter looking to go to college			0
he sees the course as a ticket to getting his life back on track in an industry that appears to be growing			2
plus , after more than a decade working on his feet in kitchens , it satisfies his desire to be creative in a job that wo n't require him to stand all day			0
" i 'm still 20 years from retirement so i took this as an opportunity to learn a trade that will give me another notch in my belt and keep me employed , " he said			0
" i do n't see this industry becoming totally automated and robotic ; there will always be a human application to it			0
" @entity0 also enjoys making things with his hands , which is why he got into leather - making in the first place			0
and , if growing consumer interest in the " made in @entity7 " trend translates to a real revival of @entity7 manufacturing jobs , he wants to be at the forefront			0
running his own successful leather goods business is the ultimate goal -- he already has a name for it , marked			0
but , in the short term , he simply wants to learn a marketable trade that interests him			0
" the desire for made in @entity7 is out there , the problem is there 's no one to make it , which is a need this program is filling , " he said			0
" i want to be part of a movement that makes factory work cool and sexy again			1

sewing and cutting class draws job - seekers from various backgrounds
