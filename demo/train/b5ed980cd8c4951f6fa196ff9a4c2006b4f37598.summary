-- president @entity1 has endorsed same - sex marriage			1
will it make any difference to the battle for marriage equality ? the news coming out of @entity8 suggests not			1
the @entity9 on tuesday voted 61 % to 39 % to amend their constitution to outlaw same - sex marriage			1
actually , they 've gone much further			0
the new amendment prohibits any kind of same - sex unions , including the relatively innocuous option of civil partnership			1
so radical is the measure that gay rights groups hoped this vote might prove to be a replay of last year 's surprise result in @entity22 , when voters rejected an amendment banning abortions because its language and consequences were considered too extreme			0
but now we know the limits of the @entity31 's social liberalism : yes to abortions , no to same - sex weddings			1
there 's a popular myth that social liberalism is unstoppable			0
but the tide of progress is a myth			0
societies have often taken a step forward only to stand perfectly still or even take a couple of steps back			0
in hindsight , the journey of black civil rights looks like a brisk jog in a straight line , but it was really a winding stumble			2
the ecstasy of emancipation was followed by the misery of segregation			0
and although legal segregation was defeated , some would argue that it still continues			0
the story of women 's rights demonstrates that sometimes social liberalism can politically overreach itself			0
in the 1970s , feminists seemed to win every battle they fought on abortion , hiring practices or school sports			0
they believed that ultimate victory would be secured with passage of the @entity68 , which would amend the @entity69 to outlaw discrimination with regard to sex			1
the @entity68 sailed through @entity74 in 1972 and was endorsed by president @entity75			2
it required the ratification of 38 states to pass , and by the end of 1973 it had 30			0
but then the @entity68 faced the same problem that same - sex marriage faces today : the sustained assault of @entity84 's social conservatives			1
the right saw the @entity68 as an assault on the traditional family			2
they feared it would force women to work in heavy labor or fight in the @entity92 , and many worried that it could even lead to same - sex marriage			1
as conservatives poured dollars into stopping ratification , more and more states either refused to ratify or rescinded			0
the @entity68 hit a geographic boundary in the @entity31 and could go no further			2
failing to reach its 38 ratifications , it faded away			0
news : @entity1 supports same - sex marriage it was n't just the money that killed the @entity68 ; supporters often outspent opponents			1
the amendment failed because the right turned it into a " line in the sand " issue , a matter on which @entity113 could say that they were happy for society to progress this far but no further			2
the same goes for same - sex marriage			1
it 's true that growing numbers of @entity113 say they support marriage equality , but then everyone lies to police officers , priests and pollsters			0
in every state that has held a popular vote on same - sex marriage , it has been defeated ( that even includes @entity129 )			1
take a look at a map of where it has been passed by state legislatures and you 'll see that it 's limited to the bits of the country that overwhelmingly vote @entity138			0
crucially , while @entity84 is trending @entity138 in demographic terms -- as the nonwhite proportion of the population increases -- this does n't translate into growing support for gay rights			2
on the contrary , the energy behind the amendment in @entity8 came from @entity149 churches , many of them deeply offended by the comparison between the struggle for emancipation and the campaign for same - sex marriage			1
likewise , @entity1 's victory in 2008 drew to the polls the same african - americans and @entity159 who simultaneously voted for @entity161 in @entity162 , outlawing same - sex marriage in the state			1
opinion : in @entity168 , support for same - sex marriage is growing increasingly , gay rights is n't a partisan issue ; the battle lines are drawn by class rather than political allegiance			1
for middle - class whites , supporting same - sex marriage is a test of tolerance that , coincidentally , distances them from the fundamentalist rabble who live down the street			1
for many african - americans , latinos and poor whites , it 's a matter of faith vs. @entity188 values			0
given how controversial it is , same - sex marriage could go the way of the @entity68 -- a reform too far , joining the long list of @entity138 , election - time promises that no one ever expects to see realized			1
and given that he offers no new policies on the subject ( he ca n't : it 's a classic states rights issue ) , @entity1 's endorsement is little more than kind words			2
they are brave words in that seven out of the nine swing states he 's contesting in november have constitutional amendments outlawing same - sex marriage -- most of them passed by popular referenda			1
" the folks , " as @entity209 calls @entity84 , do n't like it			0
does the futility of @entity1 's gesture , or the problems faced by same - sex marriage , mean it 's game over for gay rights ? not at all			1
the failure of the @entity68 did not retard women 's rights in any significant way			2
while the failure of same - sex marriage might have legal consequences for couples , it does n't mean that the @entity223 has won			1
on the contrary , vice president @entity224 accidentally got something right on sunday when he said that @entity149 attitudes toward sexuality had been forever altered by the tv sitcom " @entity230			0
" on a cultural level , homosexuality is now a fact of life in modern @entity84			0
people work with gays and lesbians , have them in their family , sit next to them in church , and , most importantly of all , see them on television			0
that degree of acculturation can never be undone , even by the ballot box			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity246			2

@entity248 : the @entity8 vote to ban same - sex marriage goes far , includes civil partnerships
he says socially liberal initiatives often move *slowly* -- the @entity68 , for example
he says @entity68 became a line in the sand for the right ; too few states ended up supporting it
@entity246 : @entity262 , @entity264 opposition does n't help the same - sex marriage issue
