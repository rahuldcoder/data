-- it is true many @entity2 celebrated the fall of @entity4 but few expected they would be held hostage to policies over which they -- the @entity2 people -- had no say but for which they would still have to pay the price			1
it is nearly impossible to put into words what this nation has gone through , the bloodshed , the psychological impact of living nine years of war -- a war that is n't over yet			1
@entity18 , like tens of thousands of other @entity2 , knows the bitter cold feel of death too well			1
" i have the courage to say that i was happy when the @entity22 arrived , but then i have hundreds of questions , " @entity18 says			1
" why did the @entity22 make so many mistakes ? was it out of ignorance about @entity2 or was it deliberate ? " " the @entity22 are leaving us fragile			1
they have n't even planted the seeds that would give us hope that we are heading towards democracy , rule of law and civil society , " she says			2
her husband , @entity34 , was killed in a bombing back in 2007			2
he was a doctor , and the couple had returned to @entity2 following the fall of @entity4 because they felt their country needed them			1
there were 10 bodies , charred and melted together at the morgue that day in april			2
@entity18 had to identify the man she calls the love of her life from a pin in his knee			2
" suddenly this scorched thing is the same thing that used to be a beating heart , standing next to you in life , " she told us , pain etched across her face			2
those steps towards the hospital morgue played out over and over again in her mind			2
" i remember a blue colored sheet covering something			2
at one end the pigtails of a little girl with red ribbons , on the other a tiny foot			2
the sheet was drenched in blood			2
at that moment i forgot why i was standing there , i was crying for all those other people , " she says			2
looking at photos from 2007 @entity18 says it 's as if she was wearing a cloak of death			0
life back then became black and white			0
now its bursting with color again , but inside she says she still carries the pain			0
her nine - year - old son @entity81 is her source of happiness			0
he 's autistic , but just this year transferred from a special needs school into a regular one			0
but even he ca n't escape the pervasiveness of death			0
every morning he recites a list of people who died and how , starting with his father			0
she says : " and when he draws , he draws a cloud and rain and then paints over it all with black , " @entity18 says			0
" this child who seems happy on the surface carries a darkness inside because of the death of his father , the death of so many of our friends			0
" i love people , i love them so much			0
if i have someone in the car with me , as soon as they leave , i put my hand down to feel the heat left by their body , to feel life			1
" standing next to @entity2 prime minister @entity111 last week , president @entity110 congratulated the @entity2 leader			1
" the prime minister leads @entity2 's most inclusive government yet , " he said			1
in his address to troops at @entity117 , @entity110 heralded the end of the war as a " moment of success			1
" but success is hardly a word most @entity2 , even those who rabidly opposed @entity4 , would associate with the @entity22 war in @entity2			1
one is hard pressed to find a family that has n't lost a loved one be it to @entity22 bombs , attacks by @entity131 and other insurgent groups , or the sectarian bloodletting that tore this nation apart			1
the majority of the @entity2 population is still struggling to come to terms with the rampant violence that shattered entire communities and turned neighbor on neighbor as streets they once used to laugh and share jokes in turned into battlefields			1
the @entity2 government began to show signs of crumbling even before the last @entity22 soldier left @entity2 soil			1
the @entity152 bloc headed by former prime minister @entity153 announced saturday that it was suspending its participation in parliament because of a lack of power - sharing			0
the bloc accuses prime minister @entity111 of consolidating power			0
@entity111 still holds full control over the security portfolio which includes the ministries of defense and interior			0
furthermore , since the end of october the @entity2 security forces have rounded up hundreds of people it accuses of being @entity169 and terrorists			1
@entity152 says the majority of those people are its members or supporters and charges that @entity111 is simply taking out his opponents one by one			0
@entity177 , media adviser to the prime minister , told @entity0 saturday that the government had confessions linking @entity181 , the @entity182 vice president and a member of @entity152 , to bombings			1
but no more information was made public and no arrest warrant was issued , amid warnings that such a move would certainly thrust the country towards yet another violent abyss			2
a few days earlier , another ranking @entity182 , deputy prime minister @entity191 , told @entity0 that @entity111 was nothing less than a dictator himself adding : " @entity111 is playing a game between @entity195 and the @entity22			1
there will be a day when the @entity22 realizes that they were deceived by @entity111 and they will regret that			1
" according to @entity2 state tv , @entity111 -- who heads the rival predominantly @entity201 bloc -- is asking parliament for a no confidence vote to remove @entity191 from power			1
the @entity2 people continue to be the victim of both their own country 's policies and those of the country -- @entity22 -- that directly or indirectly promised them a better life after @entity4			1
@entity214 , 29 , moans as she lies in bed in her dark room			0
she can no longer get up on her own			0
" i just want my leg , i do n't want anything else , " she sobs as her elderly father wipes the tears off her face			0
" i do n't even have money for medication			0
my family is poor , we have to pay rent , my mother and father are sick			0
" @entity214 used to work just outside her home selling hot sugary tea			0
she was the sole breadwinner for her impoverished family but a month ago a bomb ripped through the marketplace blowing off one of her legs			0
there are hundreds of thousands of war wounded , and according to the @entity239 , about 25 percent of them are amputees			2
" what did this girl do to deserve this ? " her father laments , tears welling in his eyes			0
" what has she done , what ? her whole future is gone			0
" the war may be over , but only for @entity22			1
in the moments after the last @entity22 convoy departed from @entity2 , one of our @entity2 colleagues , echoing a thought we 'd heard time and time again , said : " we thank the @entity22 for getting rid of @entity4 , but not for anything that happened afterwards			1

while the war is over for @entity22 , @entity2 must deal with a country still racked by violence
@entity2 must heal the scars left by nine years of war that left more than *100,000* dead
the @entity2 government has shown signs of crumbling even before the last @entity22 soldier left
