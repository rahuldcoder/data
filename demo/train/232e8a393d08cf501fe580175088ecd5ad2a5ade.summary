-- here in @entity2 , people will grieve for many days			1
how could anyone be so evil as to plant a bomb that would murder an 8 - year - old child , rip the legs off parents and devastate a celebration of athletics that is pure joy			2
these were murders that wrench the soul			2
but if these cowards thought they would scare this city -- that their acts of terror would actually terrorize -- they picked the wrong place			1
@entity2 , as president @entity19 so rightly said monday night , is a " tough and resilient town " -- always has been and always will be			1
it will heal but will not forget ; it will care for the wounded but will make the murderers pay their price			2
@entity2 has a reputation as an intellectual town , and it is that			1
two of the world 's best universities are here , along with a dozen other fine colleges and universities			1
it is electric with creativity and innovation			2
as they showed again after the bombing , its doctors and hospitals are world - class			2
citizens can find a great concert or art gallery anytime they want			1
no wonder that in contrast to most other aging cities , young and old are streaming here to live these days			2
but that does n't mean @entity2 is soft			1
@entity2 has plenty of fight , too -- just ask any team that has banged up against the @entity53 , @entity52 , @entity54 or @entity55			0
since 2004 , do n't forget , @entity2 has won championships in all four major sports			0
that does n't happen to softies			0
@entity60 : in the face of terror , keep calm the graveyards here are full of glorious men and women -- brave souls who carved the first communities out of wilderness , stood up first against @entity72 oppression , stood up first against the abomination of slavery , stood up early for the rights of women , and in recent years has stood up early and often for the rights of gays and lesbians			0
@entity80 has lots of @entity83 laureates , but it is also proud that it has the largest number of @entity87 winners of any university , save the military academies			0
traditionally , the marathon itself occurs on @entity92 in @entity93 -- a moment when people take time off to remember @entity96 and @entity96			0
one can watch re-enactments of the @entity72 marching to rid themselves of rebels -- and men without uniform but deadeyes with a rifle picking them off from the woods			0
if you want to remember the grit of the early men and women of @entity93 , pull down your copies of @entity112 's histories			1
reread " 1776 " and its fabulous stories of @entity115 and lifting the @entity72 siege of @entity2 ( when men pulled cannons all the way across @entity93 to chase away the most powerful navy in the world )			0
or reread " @entity122 , " the book that was originally intended to be about @entity122 and @entity124 -- until @entity125 fell out of love with @entity124 and into love with @entity128			0
one of my favorite episodes in the @entity122 book occurs when her husband insists on taking their teenage son , @entity134 , on a perilous voyage to @entity137			1
@entity128 writes a farewell letter to @entity134 that captures the @entity141 spirit : " it is not in the still calm of life , or the repose of a pacific station , that great characters are formed			1
the habits of a vigorous mind are formed in contending with difficulties			1
great necessities call out great virtues ... qualities which would otherwise lay dormant wake into life and form the character of the hero and the statesman			1
" in most of the country , that spirit is called toughness ; in @entity141 , it is often called hardiness			1
and with the passage of time , it has not disappeared			0
@entity166 : it can happen anywhere monday 's bombings cap a 50 - year period for @entity2 that has been marked by violence , tragedy and grief			1
it started with the assassination of a favorite son , @entity180 , in 1963 , and continued with the assassination of his brother @entity182 , later the plane crash of young @entity175 and the loss of another brother , @entity177			1
so much sadness across these years			0
yet there has been more			0
@entity93 lost 1,537 in @entity186 , 12 in the first @entity187 , and 118 so far in @entity188 and @entity189			0
on 9/11 , two of those planes flew from @entity2 's @entity192			2
violence has also stalked the streets of @entity2 , but as they have done so often , people here stood up against the tide			0
in the late 1980s , gang violence and murder were rampant ; by 1990 , @entity2 felt like @entity200 today as it had the highest number of killings in its history , many among the young			0
opinion : our ' greatest day ' turns to horror but even if it is occasionally knocked down , as it was by these bombings , the real @entity2 story is how it always gets up again			0
that spree in the ' 80s and early ' 90s of kids killing kids , even at funerals , so shocked the city that leaders of all stripes -- political , religious , business , nonprofit -- initiated a comprehensive , community - based strategy to reach at - risk youth early , and over five years , the rate of youth homicides dropped 80 %			2
there was an upward spike in the mid 2000s , but the numbers are now again falling steadily			0
war , violence , tragedy -- @entity2 wo n't surrender to darker forces			0
monday 's bombings shattered any feeling of safety			2
people here looked with horror into the abyss			0
but count on it : @entity2 is still alive with the spirit of @entity242			1
great necessities will call out great virtues , and qualities that may seem dormant will wake into life , forming the character of new heroes and new leaders			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity252 .			1

@entity252 : *bostonians* will grieve , but terrorists picked the wrong city to try to frighten
he says the city is an intellectual , cultural *bastion* but it 's not soft
he says @entity242 ' letter to son heading into peril captured tough @entity141 spirit
@entity252 : difficulties " call out great virtues , " she said in letter
