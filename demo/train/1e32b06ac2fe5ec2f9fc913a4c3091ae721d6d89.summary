-- @entity1 booked its place in the quarterfinals of the @entity4 for the first time in seven attempts following a nervy draw with @entity8 in @entity9 wednesday			1
with the game level at 1 - 1 , @entity8 's @entity10 had a glorious opportunity to win the tie with 15 minutes remaining when his side was awarded a penalty kick			1
but having already scored from the spot earlier in the game to cancel out @entity20 's opener for @entity1 , @entity16 failed to repeat the feat as @entity8 's bowed out			1
the achievement comes three years after two members of the @entity1 squad were killed in a deadly machine attack in the oil - rich enclave of @entity28 before the @entity29			1
captain @entity30 , who hid under a seat when the @entity1 team bus came under fire from separatists , revealed the team would hold prayers for the pair which lost their lives " i 'm thinking of them , " he told reporters			2
" we 're going to take five minutes to pray for them at the hotel			0
" " this is our first qualification , i 'm very happy for the team and my country , i ca n't even begin to imagine what 's happening back home ! " @entity4 2013 : the teams @entity1 will now go on to face @entity49 in the last eight , leaving @entity8 coach @entity50 to reflect on his side 's failings			1
@entity50 told reporters in @entity54 : " we did what we had to do , we dominated the play , but we lacked a bit of finishing			0
" i 'm not here to talk about the referee -- i 'm here to talk about my team			0
am i satisfied with the outcome ? not really			0
" @entity1 made the perfect start by taking the lead on 13 minutes when @entity30 's through ball sent @entity20 clear to fire home			2
@entity68 's ' @entity67 ' with @entity8 needing to win the game to advance , @entity50 's men fought back and deservedly drew level when @entity10 converted from 12 - yards following a foul on @entity74 midfielder @entity73			1
@entity8 continued to look for that elusive winner after the break , but only the crossbar denied @entity30 from heading @entity1 back in front with 21 minutes remaining			1
what can we expect from the @entity81 ? the @entity82 were given a real lifeline on 75 minutes when @entity85 referee @entity84 pointed to the penalty spot following a foul on @entity88			0
@entity10 stood up to strike the kick , but his effort hit the left post as @entity1 held out for the draw			1
" this is huge for @entity1 -- the first time they have qualified for the quarterfinals , " @entity1 coach @entity93 told reporters			0
" we were the little team in this group , and we 've made it			0
i think there will be a big party in @entity103 tonight			0
" @entity104 dumped out of @entity4 @entity105 meanwhile , tournament favorite @entity105 came from two goals down to draw 2 - 2 with @entity108 in @entity109			1
@entity105 , which had already qualified for the last eight , will face @entity110 in the next round			1
with his side already through to the next stage , coach @entity112 made nine changes to the team to face an @entity108 team without any chance of making the quarterfinals			2
@entity120 had a great early chance to give @entity108 the lead but struck his seventh minute penalty against the post			2
@entity108 was awarded a second spot kick on 64 minutes and @entity126 made no mistake before @entity128 doubled his side 's lead soon after			0
but two goals in four minutes from @entity132 and @entity133 saved embarrassment and ensured @entity105 finished the group stage unbeaten			1
" i am proud of my boys because they refused to give up when two goals behind , " @entity105 coach @entity112 told reporters			2
" i congratulate @entity108 , who did not make it easy for us and are a team to watch in the future			0
" the failure of all the @entity146 teams to make the next round surprises me			0
i am most disappointed about the departure of @entity8 , which is where my family originates from			0

@entity1 will face @entity49 in quarterfinal following 1 - 1 draw with @entity8
@entity8 misses *crucial* late penalty which would have sent it through to last eight
@entity105 tops group following 2 - 2 draw against @entity108
@entity132 and @entity133 help @entity105 come back from two goals down
