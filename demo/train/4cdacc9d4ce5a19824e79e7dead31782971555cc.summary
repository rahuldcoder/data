-- events in @entity2 have left the world wondering : where 's leader @entity5 and is he still running perhaps the most isolated country on @entity7 ? some analysts speculate @entity5 may have been ousted by an old guard from the era of his late father , whose 2011 death put the son in power			1
first , @entity5 gained a lot of weight			1
then he developed a limp			0
now the 31 - year - old leader has been out of the public eye since september 3 , during which he missed an important state meeting and , more recently , a meeting tuesday to mark the 17th anniversary of his father 's election as general secretary of the @entity27			2
those events may not seem like much			0
after all , @entity5 could merely be ill , analysts say			1
in fact , official @entity2 media said @entity5 was " suffering from discomfort , " with no elaboration			1
but a surprise weekend visit by the no. 2 and no. 3 leaders of @entity2 to @entity38 has many wondering if bigger intrigue is afoot			1
those two leaders plus another top official attended the closing of the @entity43 and then told the @entity38 that the @entity2 is willing to hold high - level meetings this fall , according to the @entity38			1
though such talks have been attempted in the past , a new round could be significant toward advancing any potential reconciliation on the long divided @entity48			0
which raises the question , where is @entity5 ? and why did the @entity2 make a last - minute visit to the @entity38 ? is @entity5 lying low ? ' it 's unprecedented ' " i do n't think anybody outside of @entity56 really knows , " said analyst @entity53 of the @entity54			1
" the fact that the no. 2 and no. 3 people in the @entity2 system traveled out of @entity2 at the same time , after the no. 1 @entity5 has been out of the public eye for weeks , and his wife as well , is very unusual , " @entity53 added			1
" it 's enough to lead some to wonder whether something of a coup has taken place			0
" has @entity2 's @entity5 been toppled ? " analyst @entity68 wrote this week in the @entity69			1
" of course , in the world 's most opaque regime , almost any scenario is plausible			0
we should know a lot more , however , when we see who is on the reviewing stand during the october 10 celebration of the founding of the @entity27			0
" until then , we can say there are signs that @entity5 has lost substantial power and will soon become , if he is not already , a figurehead , " @entity68 wrote			2
citing sources , the @entity69 also reported last week that @entity2 imposed a ban on new travel passes for entering or leaving the country			2
ambassador avoids @entity5 health question on tuesday , @entity89 , deputy ambassador from @entity2 to the @entity90 , declined to respond to @entity0 's questions about whether such reports mean something larger , such as instability and pending change within the regime			1
the ambassador did address travel issues within the country and said that citizens have the right to travel			2
when asked about the condition of @entity5 , the ambassador deflected the question and said he had a " program " to attend and left			1
a @entity2 defector , @entity106 , who was a prominent propagandist for @entity5 's late father , said the @entity5 is already a " puppet " of a shadowy oligarchy			1
a ' symbolic ' leader an old guard who make up the @entity112 and @entity113 , or @entity114 , are the real " power holders , " @entity106 said via telephone from @entity38 last week			2
they were tied closely to the @entity118 and are not beholden to his son , he said			0
" @entity5 is a symbolic head of state , " @entity106 said			2
" symbolically he became @entity120			0
he did not necessarily inherit all the loyalties , the trust , the connections , experiences			0
he came in as a newcomer , and his position in the system is not the same			0
" @entity106 , who defected to @entity38 almost a decade ago , said he has spoken with highly placed sources within the regime in recent days			2
the @entity114 , he said , " are calling the shots , and not the words of one man they do not know			0
basically , they 're no longer loyal to the ruling king 's word , " @entity106 said			0
neither @entity0 nor @entity137 intelligence officials can confirm whether @entity106 's claims are credible , but @entity139 -- who has studied @entity2 for two decades for @entity140 , a nonprofit agency that provides research and analysis to @entity137 government agencies -- agreed that the @entity114 has enormous clout			1
the idea that @entity5 was ousted by the @entity114 is a theory " that you sometimes hear from @entity149 diplomatic personnel that are stationed in @entity2 , " said @entity151 , a professor at @entity152			1
" some evidence of this are pictures , propaganda pictures we see of the @entity2 leader , @entity5 , that are unflattering pictures that show his girth or that show the back of his head , " @entity151 said			1
" these are apparently all signs by the @entity114 that they are in control more than this young fellow is			0
" simply ill @entity165 , who specializes in @entity167 issues for the @entity168 , downplayed the likelihood of a power struggle in @entity56			1
he said that high - level maneuvering to influence @entity5 is a more likely scenario than any effort to strip him of power			2
" this is a top - down system			0
there is no no. 2 , " @entity165 said			0
" it is a royal system , a dynastic system predicated on there being a @entity5 and then , dare i say , a ' next of @entity5 ' able to wield authoritative power from the top on an unquestioned basis			2
" the other dominant theory is that @entity5 is simply ill. after all , @entity5 has a family history of diabetes , obesity and sumptuous living , analysts said			1
" @entity5 combines all that plus the worst of @entity192 pop culture , cokes and @entity195 fries ... , " @entity53 said			2
@entity196 , an analyst at @entity198 's @entity197 , doubts @entity5 is in political hot water			1
" people get sick , " he said			0
" i would n't make much of it			0
" why @entity2 reaches out to @entity38 @entity196 said he believes @entity5 is still in charge and orchestrated saturday 's remarkable visit that occurred in the @entity38			1
" @entity2 diplomacy has been engaged in concerted , well - arranged , well - managed efforts to improve relations with pretty much the entire outside world			2
and you would not expect it to happen with nobody in control , " he said			0
the reason for the @entity2 's friendlier approach bears upon economics , he said			1
" they want @entity38 money and they want normal trade , which is subsidized by @entity38 , " @entity196 said			0
in particular , the @entity219 would like the @entity38 to lift the so - called may 24 @entity220 , a heavy trade sanction taken in 2010 after the @entity221 sank a @entity38 ship , killing 46 sailors			0
if the worst of political skullduggery has occurred -- that is , @entity5 is out of power -- then @entity2 becomes a place of greater concern , @entity151 said			1
" if this guy is no longer in play , and we do n't know that , but let 's say he is , he is no longer in place , there 's no clear line of succession , " @entity151 said			0
" if there 's an internal power struggle , we do n't know the security of the nuclear weapons , the security of the missiles , and it can be manifested in terms of conventional military acts against the @entity38 , either intentionally or inadvertently that can then trigger greater prices on the peninsula , " @entity151 said			1
" so stuff that happens inside of @entity2 can certainly affect folks on the outside in very bad ways			0
" @entity0 's @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity260 contributed to this report .			0

@entity5 's *monthlong* *absence* from public provokes speculation on whether he 's been ousted
other analysts say he 's simply ill but is still orchestrating a @entity2 visit to @entity38
official @entity2 media acknowledges @entity5 is " suffering from discomfort "
@entity2 's deputy ambassador to @entity90 declines to address @entity5 's health
