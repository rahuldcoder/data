-- going into @entity2 2013 , there was little doubt that @entity4 was going to win his run for re-election			1
the only unknown was what he would say in his victory speech			0
the tough - talking @entity11 headliner has the most buzz of any potential 2016 @entity11 presidential candidate and he created more by delivering a speech that was aimed at both @entity15 and a national audience			1
" and you do n't just show up six months before an election			0
you show up four years before one			2
and you do n't just take no for an answer the first time no has happened			0
you keep going back and trying more , " @entity4 told the audience in @entity22			1
@entity11 strategist and @entity0 contributor @entity24 called @entity4 's address " an announcement speech			1
" and it will only serve to stir up more speculation that despite his saying that he 's seriously considering a run in 2016 , his mind is already made up			0
@entity0 exit polls show @entity4 performed well with groups that normally cast ballots for @entity35			2
exit polls indicate the @entity11 governor grabbing 57 % of the female vote and winning all age groups other than those 18 - 29			2
@entity4 also took a fifth of the @entity42 - @entity41 vote and half - 51 % - of @entity43 , a much better performance than most @entity11 in recent elections			2
overall , @entity4 bested his little - known @entity35 challenger , @entity46 , by a 60 % -38 % margin with about 99 % of the vote counted			2
@entity49 and @entity15 are the only two states that hold elections for governor in the year after a presidential contest			1
and @entity49 's race provided the only real drama as votes were counted			1
democrat @entity57 , a long - time @entity58 confidant , trailed @entity11 state attorney general @entity59 through the evening until votes from @entity35 strongholds started rolling in and propelled him to victory			1
a complete list of election results the race was nasty from the get - go and devolved into incessant mudslinging and personal attacks			2
voters throughout the commonwealth of @entity49 were bombarded by negative ads and polling showed that neither candidate was particularly well - liked by the people who would be voting for them			1
with nearly all of the vote counted , @entity57 held a 48 % -45 % margin over @entity59			1
libertarian @entity77 pulled in about 7 % of the vote , which could have made the difference			0
in @entity82 , the race for mayor was never in question , either , as democrat @entity84 defeated @entity11 @entity85 , by a 73 % -24 % margin with 91 % of the vote in , making the city 's public advocate the first @entity84 to lead the nation 's largest city in a generation			1
in @entity93 , an establishment candidate defeated a tea party - backed candidate in a @entity11 primary runoff for the congressional seat from @entity93 's 1st district , which had been seen as precursor of @entity101 party contests in next year 's midterm elections			1
@entity103 , a former state senator , defeated businessman @entity104 in the race by a 52 % -48 % margin with all of the vote in			2
the contest was the first time @entity11 voters could weigh in on which direction they want to take their party after the partial federal government shutdown in october was laid largely at the feet of tea party instigators in @entity116			0
exit polls : @entity4 and @entity57 took different paths to victory here 's a closer look at some of the night 's most interesting races and ballot measures : a nasty race in purple @entity49 the @entity57 and @entity59 campaigns engaged in nasty political warfare with @entity57 making sure that women were aware of @entity59 's support of " personhood " legislation that critics say restricts abortion and some forms of birth control , while @entity59 frequently highlighted federal investigations of an electric car company that @entity57 co-founded			1
@entity57 and @entity35 pinned @entity59 as a tea party activist , linking him to conservative lawmakers in @entity140 who initiated a strategy that eventually led to the government shutdown			1
take a closer look at the @entity49 race what does @entity4 's win say about 2016 ? while much of his address was directed at his @entity15 audience , @entity4 also had a message for the nation			1
" i know tonight , a dispirited @entity41 , angry with their dysfunctional government in @entity140 , looks to @entity15 to say , ' is what i think happening really happening ? are people really coming together			2
are we really working , african - americans and @entity158 , suburbanites and city dwellers , farmers and teachers			0
are we really all working together			0
' " let me give the answer to everyone who is watching tonight : under this government our first job is to get the job done and as long as i 'm governor that job will always , always be finished , " more on @entity4 's big win @entity82 picks first @entity35 mayor in a generation at the center of the @entity82 mayor 's race were disagreements over taxes and the city 's controversial " stop - and - frisk " program backed by incumbent mayor @entity179			1
@entity181 campaigned on a promise to raise taxes on those earning more than $ 500,000 a year to pay for universal prekindergarten , an idea @entity85 vehemently opposed			0
go deeper on the @entity82 race deep - pocketed @entity11 pick winner in @entity93 @entity103 , the establishment candidate , far outraised @entity104 , the @entity188 candidate , thanks to major help from the business wing of the party , including the @entity193			1
he also garnered endorsements from establishment figures , including several @entity11 @entity197 leaders			0
however , despite support for smaller tea party personalities , @entity104 was largely ignored by the national tea party groups			0
