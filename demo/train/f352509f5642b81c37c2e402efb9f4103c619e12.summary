-- president @entity1 has nominated his top counterterrorism adviser , @entity2 , to be the next director of the @entity4			1
if there is an emerging @entity1 doctrine to deal with the threat from @entity9 and its allies , it is clearly a rejection of the use of conventional military forces and a growing reliance instead on the use of drones and @entity17 -- and @entity2 has been central to @entity1 's policy			1
in an april 30 speech at the @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity2 laid out the rationale for the drone policy in more detail than any administration official had done publicly hitherto			2
he asserted that the drone strikes are legal both under the @entity27 passed by @entity28 after the september 11 attacks and because , " there is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield , at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat			0
" this does not appear to be the view of @entity45 , @entity47 special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights , who announced plans at @entity51 in october to launch an investigation into @entity54 drone attacks and the extent to which they cause civilian casualties			0
politics : compared to @entity61 , reaction to @entity2 nomination muted one of @entity2 's most significant legacies in the four years he has been the president 's principal adviser on terrorism is the @entity54 drone campaign against @entity9 and its allies in countries such as @entity69 and @entity70 -- one that has shifted focus significantly in the past year or so			1
on thursday , a @entity4 drone strike in the @entity75 tribal region of @entity69 killed @entity76 , a leading @entity77 commander			1
that strike garnered considerable coverage in media outlets around the world and by @entity54 - based news organizations such as the @entity83 and @entity0			0
the same day a @entity4 drone killed three suspected @entity86 militants near the town of @entity88 in @entity70			1
there was scant media coverage of this attack			0
yet thursday 's dueling strikes in @entity69 and @entity70 are emblematic of a quiet and largely unheralded shift in the way that the @entity4 conducts its operations			1
the accompanying bar chart ( click on it to enlarge ) does a good job of representing this shift			0
the red bars are @entity54 strikes in @entity69 , and the gold bars are @entity54 strikes in @entity70 based on data collected from reliable news reports by the @entity104			2
( due to the difficulty of distinguishing between what may be a @entity54 drone strike or an airstrike by the @entity70 air force , the true number of @entity54 drone attacks in @entity70 could be even higher than is shown in this chart			2
) one possible reason for the decline of drone strikes in @entity69 is that the @entity4 is simply running out of targets ; at least 36 militant leaders have been reported killed by drones in @entity69 since @entity1 took office , according to the @entity104 data			1
the growing criticism of the drone program in @entity69 has also surely had some role in the @entity1 administration 's decision to scale back the intensity of the drone campaign there			1
in april the @entity69 @entity130 formally voted for the first time to end any kind of approval for the @entity4 drone program			2
opinion : when are drone killings illegal ? unlike in @entity69 where political leaders have almost universally -- at least in public -- condemned the strikes , @entity70 president @entity140 said in september during an interview with the @entity142 that he personally signs off on all @entity54 drone strikes in @entity70 , and that they hit their targets accurately , asserting , " the drone technologically is more advanced than the human brain			1
" the steadily increasing rate of drone strikes in @entity70 over the past two years shows that the @entity4 's drone war -- rather than declining -- is shifting from one part of the world to another			1
@entity2 has been the key architect of this policy			2
the @entity155 - speaking @entity2 , who was once @entity4 station chief in @entity157 , in a sense became the " case officer " for the @entity70 " account , " traveling to @entity70 seven times since @entity86 sent the so - called underwear bomber to try and bring down @entity163 235 over @entity164 on christmas day 2009			1
read more : who 's in , who 's out of cabinet how effective has the subsequent @entity54 campaign against this group been ? @entity86 has not tried to launch an attack on a target in the @entity172 since its abortive attempt to bring down cargo planes bound for the @entity54 more than two years ago , so the campaign does appear to have suppressed the group 's abilities to attack overseas			0
according to a count by @entity180 , at least 28 of the group 's leading members have been killed in drone strikes , including the notorious @entity54 - born cleric @entity182 , who played an operational role in @entity86 , for instance , offering instruction to the underwear bomber			0
balanced , against this is the fact that some of the popular resentment against the @entity54 , drone campaign that has long been the case in @entity69 is beginning to emerge in @entity70			1
on friday , dozens of armed tribesmen took to the streets of @entity88 protesting the drone strike that had taken place a day earlier			0
one of the tribesman told @entity197 that seven civilians had been killed in that drone strike			0
and the drone program in @entity70 is also stirring some of the same controversy internationally that the strikes in @entity69 have done for many years			1
human rights groups in the @entity54 are particularly aggrieved by the targeted killing of @entity182 , an @entity54 citizen who was killed by a drone along with his teenage son			0
@entity207 , who has written an authoritative book about @entity86 , " the last refuge : @entity70 , @entity9 , and @entity214 in @entity157 , " says the group has grown from around 200 fighters to more than 1,000 and that the drone campaign has helped it to recruit these new fighters			2
@entity215 , a @entity216 academic , conducted interviews of tribal leaders in @entity70 in june 2012			0
@entity215 found that it was n't the drone campaign that had swelled the ranks of @entity86 but rather because the group was able to offer jobs to desperately poor young men			0
@entity70 is the poorest country in the @entity226 world			0
and drone strikes are now reportedly being considered by the @entity1 administration in the @entity230 nation of @entity231 , where an @entity9 affiliate has largely taken control of the north of the country , an area the size of @entity237			0
@entity2 has been at the center of the decisions about the use of drones in @entity69 and @entity70 and their possible use in @entity231 , and all of this surely will be a matter of discussion during his forthcoming nomination hearings			1
a road map to what @entity2 will likely say about drones in his nomination hearing is provided by his april speech at the @entity20 in which he explained that drone strikes are " ethical " because of " the unprecedented ability of remotely piloted aircraft to precisely target a military objective while minimizing collateral damage ; one could argue that never before has there been a weapon that allows us to distinguish more effectively between an @entity9 terrorist and innocent civilians			2
