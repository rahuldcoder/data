-- you may have noticed : @entity2 has become respectable in his old age			1
" @entity5 , " says @entity4 , is all about @entity2			1
and that 's a great thing			2
to judge by the release pattern and some of the more reverent reviews , you would think the 78 - year - old director 's second movie of the season ( after " changeling " ) was another prestige picture with @entity15 firmly in its sights , along the lines of " @entity18 " or " letters from @entity20			1
" nominations may be forthcoming , or they may not ( we 'll find out january 22 ) , but trust me , " @entity5 " is not that kind of animal			1
it 's a crude but pungent stab at popular filmmaking , blue - collar and bare - knuckle			2
which is not to say it 's disappointing			2
on the contrary , it 's an entertaining star vehicle that does its job well			1
other films around right now tackle " important " themes -- the @entity39 , justice , alienation -- but " @entity5 " is all about @entity2 : the suspicious squint , granite composure and bad - ass attitude			1
is @entity2 important ? if you have grown up with this enduring @entity47 icon , there 's no question about it			1
apparently @entity51 's screenplay was n't written specifically for him , but after seeing the film it 's impossible to imagine it with anyone else			2
@entity2 's @entity56 is a @entity57 veteran and retired auto worker , a grumpy old man and the last white guy holding on to his property in an inner - city neighborhood that 's been taken over by @entity63			1
the movie opens at his wife 's funeral			1
( how many times have we seen @entity2 with a wife on screen ? not too often			1
) @entity56 's not happy , of course , but more than anything , he seems pissed off			2
his kids are a sore disappointment			2
the grandkids merit nothing more than a growl			0
at the wake , even the priest , @entity77 ( freckle - faced @entity78 ) , is quickly shown the door			0
@entity56 is alone now , and he means to keep it that way			0
he sits on a deck chair out on his front porch , a cooler of beer beside him , the @entity47 flag hanging limp over his square patch of lawn			0
it 's a portrait of implacable @entity47 isolationism -- until the teenage son of his @entity94 next - door neighbor encroaches on @entity56 's turf			0
@entity96 ( @entity97 ) nearly gets his head blown off trying to steal @entity56 's prized 1972 @entity99			0
to apologize , and to thank the white guy for stepping in to save him from the gangbangers who put him up to the stunt , @entity96 reluctantly reports for a week of whatever chores @entity56 might ask of him			0
the grudging mutual respect that develops between them is entirely predictable , but in @entity2 's clean , unfussy but discreetly patient direction , even a banal task -- like wrestling an old fridge out of the basement -- assumes the bonding power @entity113 and @entity114 found in digging out a stubborn tree stump in " @entity116			1
" like other @entity118 heroes before him , @entity56 sacrifices his independence by accepting that others depend on him			0
the relationship is also laced with plenty of gruff humor			0
if you 're feeling indulgent , the film has almost as many laughs as a comedy			0
the older man introduces @entity96 to his barber ( @entity129 ) for a lesson in guy talk -- which turns out to be the art of barking invective with impunity			2
( pc , it 's not			0
) meanwhile , @entity56 's own racist ( @entity140 ) @entity139 mentality thaws when @entity96 's self - assured sister @entity141 ) introduces him to the pleasures of @entity144 food			0
all the while , the neighborhood punks hover in the background , waiting for the right moment to test whether @entity149 is firing anything more than blanks these days			0
@entity51 's screenplay is n't subtle , and some of the young cast struggle to camouflage its crudeness , but @entity2 revels in the pragmatic design and roughneck humor of the piece			1
@entity56 may be a dinosaur , but he carries a big footprint			0
in a similar way , " @entity5 " is no classic , but at least it 's a star vehicle worthy of a true legend			1
" @entity5 " is rated r and runs 116 minutes			1
for @entity165 's take , click here .			0

" @entity5 " is *vintage* @entity2 , right down to the attitude
star vehicle , directed by @entity2 , about old man , his car and neighbors
movie is made for @entity2 , and @entity2 makes the movie
