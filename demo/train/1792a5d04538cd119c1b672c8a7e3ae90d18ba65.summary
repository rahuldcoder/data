-- " a little more light ! " it 's an early morning photo shoot for @entity3 @entity2			1
there 's a blizzard outside the window of @entity7 in @entity8 as the crew sets up in a flurry : photographers meticulously adjust the lighting , makeup and hair artists arrange their bounty of brushes and stylists hang up racks upon racks of familiar names -- @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26			1
they 're all here for one person			2
" hi , i 'm @entity31			2
" the woman in an unassuming black tank top , jeans , simple ponytail and hoop earrings ( a staple she would later credit to growing up in @entity40 ) introduces herself to the crew -- but everybody in the room already knows who she is			2
see all of @entity47 's @entity46 coverage " people know me from a lot of places , " she tells @entity0 later at her @entity49 , home			1
" @entity54 - dot - com @entity53 ! " she laughs			1
@entity55 first caught a glimpse of the spotlight on the third season of the cult favorite and gif - ready reality show " @entity61			1
" the day after she finished the show , she decided to begin her transition into the @entity53 we know today -- a proud transgender fashion personality			1
@entity55 says she has known since she was in kindergarten			1
she went to a catholic school and had a crush on a fellow classmate , @entity69 ; she would get in trouble for running up to him and kissing him on the cheek every day			2
" i knew that it was n't me , as a boy having a crush on a boy			2
it was me , wanting to be a pretty girl , having a crush on a boy , " she says			2
after a parent - teacher conference , she was transferred to a public school and put two and two together : she should n't express her femininity outside the home			0
" my parents , thank @entity85 , never forced me to act any other kind of way but myself , so i was really lucky , " she says			0
" but when i was in school or outside the house , it was always an act , it was always a cover - up -- and i grew up with a lot of frustration			0
" at 18 , she got her first car and left some of that frustration in the rearview mirror			0
she drove to @entity8 and became immersed in the drag club scene , where she began to " live freely and happily			0
" then came " @entity99			0
" since appearing on the show , @entity55 has gained more than 66,000 followers on @entity102 , 90,000 on @entity103 and 215,000 on @entity104			1
@entity55 became a part of the mainstream media conversation when she received more than 46,000 signatures on a @entity110 petition to become @entity112 's first transgender " angel			1
" the petition gained a significant amount of traction only a few days before the 2013 fashion show was set to tape in november , but it was ultimately unsuccessful			0
( the company has not responded to the petition			0
) @entity112 petitioned to hire first transgender model even so , she says , the support from fans has motivated her to try out for the over-the - top lingerie show in 2014			1
" it 's kind of like validation , " she says			1
" no matter how insecure i might be , no matter how un-pretty i might feel , there are people out there who look to me to be strong and to keep going and to keep proving people wrong			0
" @entity55 's not the first transgender model -- and certainly not the last -- but in the fashion world , where cutting edge androgyny is often en vogue , the industry has been criticized for its sluggishness to embrace the transgender sector , different body shapes and diversity overall			1
@entity140 , @entity142 call for an end to runway racism there has been some progress			0
legendary fashion photographer @entity147 captured 17 transgender models -- many of them nonprofessionals -- for luxury retailer @entity153 's latest catalog and magazine campaign			1
high - profile transgender community members , such as actress @entity155 and writer @entity156 , are also speaking more openly about their experiences navigating a world that can be ignorant and even hostile about these issues			1
what not to say to a transgender person in an autobiographical essay in @entity163 , @entity55 said : " i want to leave something behind so people can look back one day and say , ' wow , remember when transpeople were discriminated against the most ? this person was like , screw everybody ! i 'm going to parade around half - naked and be superproud , because that 's how everyone should be ! ' " which leads her to today on set : she 's represented by @entity175 , one of the world 's leading model agencies			1
she 's an unconventional choice , not only because of her gender : she 's 28 amid a portfolio of girls in their late teens to early 20s , and she 's admittedly a bit curvier than her runway counterparts			2
she 's also a stepmother to her domestic partner 's 9 - year - old daughter			2
" ... nor winter storm ca n't stop me baby , " she mouths along to @entity190 as the makeup artist finishes a decidedly fresh and natural look			0
@entity195 is the stylist coordinating the looks			0
while many designers sent pieces fit for @entity55 's burlesque persona , @entity195 went for more subdued offerings , like a @entity21 pure white jumpsuit or a @entity202 , knee - length skirt			1
" i wanted you to be able to see her spirit , and her face and her eyes , as opposed to just body , just big hair , just tons of makeup , " she says			0
" we wanted to kind of make everything very sparse and very simple , just to get the essence of her			0
" " wow , i look like a grown - up , " @entity55 says			1
" i 'm used to wearing so much more makeup			0
" for the next six hours , @entity55 will pose for frame after frame , every now and then stopping to change outfits and loosen up her facial muscles after holding a pose			1
there 's a mirror behind the photographer that she occasionally glances in to try out a new pose , almost in awe of what 's looking back at her			2
" when you go through a transition like this , your body , your face is always changing			0
so , in an industry where you 're being paid to sell either a product or take a photo , you know you have to learn your angles , " she says			0
what about the question that every woman dreads : do you think you 're pretty ? " i 'm very happy with myself , " she says			0
" it 's not even about being pretty or being beautiful , it 's just that i 'm very happy with myself			2
" " and i ca n't change , even if i tried , " @entity55 sings along to @entity250 while striking a pose			1
" all of the designers were super excited we were shooting her			0
they flew in clothing for her , " says @entity195 , who added that she hopes the shoot in an international glossy legitimizes @entity55 's career beyond the transgender realm			1
@entity55 wants that level of success , too			1
she says she looks up to the supermodels of the ' 90s : the @entity266 , @entity267 and @entity265			0
the ones who were on a first - name basis with the world			0
casting the outcast at @entity46 " i want to be like those girls , " she says			0
" i do n't want to just be labeled as a transgender model			1
... why do i have to be separated ? it 's the modeling industry -- one industry			2

transgender model @entity53 recently shot a spread for @entity3 @entity2
fans petitioned for @entity55 to be @entity112 's first transgender angel
@entity55 wants to be labeled as a model , not just a trans model
