-- when @entity2 was knocked off the top of the women 's tennis world rankings by younger sister @entity6 in july 2002 , she could n't have imagined that over a decade later she would still be waiting for a return to the summit			1
despite winning three further @entity10 singles titles since last being no. 1 , the @entity9 has endured a 10 - year spell blighted by losses of form and fitness -- culminating in being diagnosed with @entity17 at last year 's @entity18			1
but the 32 - year - old is on the comeback trail , setting her sights on a return to the top of the world -- plus singles and doubles glory at @entity28 -- after thursday 's third - round win over @entity32 runner - up @entity30 at the @entity33			1
@entity6 battles ' super crazy hair ' " before all my injuries and illnesses i was no. 2 in the world and @entity6 was no. 1 , and we were no. 1 in doubles , " the seven - time grand slam winner , now ranked 64th , told reporters			1
" we were literally on top of the world until a lot of things came crashing down on us			0
i 'd like to work my way back			0
of course that 's a dream for me			0
" i dream of those things			0
that 's why i 'm here , because i feel like i still have it			0
it 's one match at a time , pretty much			2
" @entity2 ' reward is a quarterfinal match against third seed @entity55 , the @entity56 who beat @entity6 in an ill - tempered 2011 @entity18 final to claim her first grand slam title			1
while @entity2 is trying to recapture her best form , younger sister @entity6 is the dominant force in women 's tennis			1
the world @entity64 won a fifth @entity10 title last month before returning to @entity67 to destroy @entity68 in the @entity71 women 's singles final at @entity72			0
the 14 - time major winner continued her imperious run of form by battling past a stubborn @entity76 6 - 4 6 - 3			1
after the match , @entity6 spoke of fondness for the @entity79 , whose older sister @entity80 is top seed for the hard - court tournament and reached the last eight with a three - set win over @entity9 teenager @entity84			2
" i think they 're both great players , and great sisters , " the 30 - year - old said as she continued her quest for a first @entity33 title			2
" i absolutely love seeing another pair of sisters doing so well on the tour			0
" @entity76 has worked really hard , and me being a younger sister and @entity76 being a younger sister too , i 'm always looking for her to do well and i hope she does really well			1
" her game is great			0
what 's best about her game is she 's like her sister -- she does n't do anything badly			2
those are always tough opponents to play			0
" @entity6 's next opponent is @entity101 fifth seed @entity99 , who advanced courtesy of a 6 - 4 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) defeat of @entity106 qualifier @entity104			1
also safely through is 2011 @entity10 champion @entity107			2
after picking up her first title of 2012 in @entity111 on monday , the world @entity108 continued her winning run by beating @entity113 's @entity112 6 - 2 6 - 2 .			0
