-- @entity1 could have an exploding whale problem			2
the carcasses of three blue whales , the world 's biggest mammals , washed up on the western shores of the island of @entity9 this month , and now two towns with carcasses in their boundaries find themselves facing a huge predicament : how do they get rid of the decomposing leviathans before something bad happens , like an explosion ? that 's the fear of some of the 600 residents of @entity21 , where an 81 - foot - long , 60 - ton carcass is bloating on the waterfront as methane gas inside expands , according to a report from @entity26			1
" i 'm not sure with the heat and gases that are trapped inside of this mammal if at some point in time it will explode , " @entity27 , @entity21 's town clerk , said in an interview published in @entity29			1
@entity34 , a scientist with @entity1 's @entity35 , said a whale explosion is unlikely			2
he 's more worried someone could fall inside the decomposing beast			2
" the ( whale ) skin is starting to lose its integrity and if someone were to walk along , say , the chin -- that is full of all that gas -- they could fall in the whale			2
the insides will be liquefied			0
retrieving them would be very difficult , " @entity34 , told the @entity48			0
excluding either of those scenarios , the decaying whales poses a stinky problem as tourist season nears			0
" normally we advertise whales to get people to come , where the restaurant is right on the beach and we often have whales in the cove frolicking about , but we do n't want a dead whale as an attraction , " @entity54 , who owns the @entity55 in @entity21 , told @entity56			1
a second blue whale carcass is in @entity68 , where mayor @entity69 said the smell is getting worse by the day			1
he said the @entity1 government has said local authorities in the town of 1,000 people must bear the responsibility and cost of removal , just as they must do in @entity21 , according to the @entity56			1
but @entity27 , who told the @entity78 she originally considered asking local fishermen to tow the carcass out to sea , said her town does n't have the money or expertise to do so			1
" i 'm not willing to take on the responsibility , " she is quoted as saying			0
" if that whale does explode , we do n't know what danger that would be to our infrastructure , the longliner ( fishing boat ) itself , or to people			1
" and she said if the whale were towed out to sea , it could be considered a hazard to navigation by federal authorities			0
@entity34 told @entity101 in most cases whales would be left to decompose where they lie			2
" normally , it would have washed ashore on a beach somewhere and would have slowly rotted away and the carnivores and predators would have worked at it until , in a few years time , there would only be bones left , " he said			1
@entity27 hopes that 's not the case in @entity21			0
" it 's only going to be a matter of time before it warms up and the smell becomes unbearable , " she told @entity101			0
the whales are believed to be among nine of the endangered species crushed or drowned by ice while feeding , according to a @entity26 report			0
while it is not unusual for marine mammals to be trapped by shifting ice , a denser ice pack has made the problem worse this year .			0

dead blue whales have washed ashore in two @entity9 towns
residents worry whales could explode as gases build up from decomposition
scientists says people should be wary of falling inside dead whale
