-- the woe is over for @entity2 in @entity4 finals after it defeated @entity5 2 - 1 in a pulsating all @entity7 contest in @entity8 on saturday			1
the woe is over , too , for @entity10 , who scored the winner in the 89th minute and set up @entity13 's opener in the 60th			1
@entity16 's penalty in the 68th had pulled @entity5 level prior to @entity10 's nifty decider			1
@entity10 was labeled a villain by @entity2 fans last year , when he missed a penalty and other opportunities in the final against @entity25			1
" i do not know how many times i dreamed about it but i said to many people that tonight was going to be our night , " @entity10 told @entity26			2
no wonder he was celebrating wildly at the final whistle			0
indeed the euphoria among @entity2 players at @entity33 was fully understandable , since this was a team that had lost three of its four previous finals , two in agonizing fashion			1
minutes away from beating @entity41 , two injury - time goals from the @entity43 deprived @entity44 and led to one of the most lasting images in @entity4 history -- defender @entity48 overflowing in tears and pounding the turf at @entity52 's @entity51 in frustration			1
@entity48 would later say it was destiny for @entity41			0
the same , perhaps , could have been uttered when @entity25 inflicted more heartache in 2012 in @entity2 's own stadium			1
with @entity2 firmly in control of the game at 1 - 0 , this time a late effort from @entity25 striker @entity60 tied proceedings and prompted extra time -- when @entity10 did n't captalize from the spot -- and then penalties			1
paying the price for missed opportunities -- @entity10 and striker @entity67 were particularly guilty -- @entity25 prevailed to give the @entity68 their first trophy in football 's most prestigious club competition			1
another @entity73 team had gotten the better of @entity2			2
the heart of @entity2 's midfield , @entity76 , was on that occasion inconsolable , mirroring @entity48			1
" we knew after last season what we needed to do and we have improved , " @entity10 said			2
there was a sense of destiny about @entity5 , since @entity85 's men scored two injury - time goals in the second leg of the quarterfinals against @entity89 to advance			1
but when @entity5 could n't convert its superiority in the first half into goals , @entity2 slowly got into the game			1
@entity2 , which won the @entity95 title by 25 points over @entity5 and crushed @entity52 in the semifinals of the @entity4 , now has the chance to emulate the @entity41 team of 1999 and achieve the treble			1
@entity102 ' men will be the heavy favorite in the @entity105 final on june 1 against @entity106			0
if not for a tax scandal involving @entity2 president @entity109 , who was at @entity33 , the season could almost be classified as perfect			0
some would ask : " who needs @entity111 ? " but his arrival next season , replacing @entity102 , potentially heralds an exciting period			0
he can take advantage of a highly skilled side in implementing his possession based style			0
@entity119 will add to @entity44 's impressive squad , making the move from @entity5 in the off - season			1
an awkward scenario in the final was avoided since midfielder @entity119 , described as a " once in a century player " by @entity7 legend @entity126 , missed out due to injury			0
@entity5 striker @entity128 , whose four goals in the semifinals against @entity131 bolstered his reputation further , is being linked with a move to @entity2			1
in short , the future could bring even more trophies			0
what must @entity5 -- thought of by some as a team of destiny after its injury - time comeback in the quarterfinals against @entity89 -- be thinking ? it was @entity5 , which nearly went bankrupt in 2005 , who made the much brighter start , even though @entity85 appeared anxious as he took his spot on the bench			2
while @entity5 's fans clad in team colors of yellow and black sang in the stands , the usual smile on his face was n't to be found			2
@entity156 international @entity155 's shot from outside the box might have sailed harmlessly over the bar in the 10th minute , but it signaled the start of an impressive spell			0
@entity128 , much sought after , made a fine run inside the box before he ran out of room and was unable to deliver a cross			0
a minute later , @entity128 's curled effort from distance was comfortably pushed over the bar by @entity2 keeper @entity168			2
@entity168 , the @entity7 no. 1 , would be busy in the next 10 minutes , stopping @entity155 with his legs from close range -- his best save of the evening -- keeping out @entity172 ' left - footed strike and thwarting @entity173			0
@entity168 was unusually busy , since he averaged a mere two saves per game all season			0
such was @entity2 's frustration that winger @entity178 used an arm to cast aside @entity128			2
former @entity181 manager @entity180 , an analyst for @entity183 television , said @entity178 deserved a red card			0
@entity186 referee @entity185 , however , did n't even show him a yellow			0
@entity185 would be in the spotlight later			0
@entity2 finally worked its way into the game midway in the half			2
@entity178 found himself in space on the left and put in an inviting cross for striker @entity13 -- who started ahead of @entity7 international @entity67			0
his header was tipped over the bar by @entity197			0
on the ensuing corner , midfielder @entity198 leapt the highest , though his header did n't hit the target			0
he made himself big to deny @entity10 and near the end of the half , defender @entity201 misjudged a ball in the air to hand the alert @entity10 a second chance			2
@entity197 utilized his face to keep the match scoreless at the interval			0
@entity5 did n't start as well in the second half , yet was n't put under any pressure by @entity2			1
that changed in the 59th minute , when @entity13 's header fell straight to @entity197			1
the shot was tame , but @entity5 's frailty in the air was again exposed			2
@entity2 took the lead a minute later , as @entity10 finally dealt with @entity197			1
when @entity197 charged off his line , @entity10 went around the @entity7 and sent a low cross to @entity13 , who had the simplest of tap ins			1
@entity2 was on its way			0
or was it ? needing to stay tight at the back for the next 10 minutes , @entity2 defender @entity223 gave @entity5 a lifeline			1
he completely missed his clearance in the box and kicked @entity172 in the stomach			0
@entity185 awarded @entity5 the penalty , but @entity223 -- already booked -- did n't receive a second yellow			2
stopped three weeks ago by @entity168 on a penalty , @entity128 gave way to @entity233			0
the diminutive midfielder sent @entity168 the wrong way in the 68th			0
@entity2 fans must have thought it was @entity239 vu , especially when @entity5 defender @entity240 made a last - ditch clearance with @entity10 about to pounce from a yard out			1
both teams continued to press forward , and @entity197 dived to his left to stop @entity245			0
@entity185 waived play on when @entity247 felt he was impeded by @entity240 , the last man , but @entity2 's angst did n't last long			2
with @entity5 's defense unable to clear , @entity10 waltzed into the box and deftly wrong - footed @entity197			1
it was redemption for @entity10 and @entity2 .			1

@entity10 's late goal gives @entity2 the @entity4 title
@entity10 also set up @entity13 's goal early in the second half
@entity10 missed a penalty in extra time as @entity2 lost to @entity25 in the 2012 final
@entity5 fails in its bid to win a second @entity4 crown
