@entity0 -- the air traffic controller suspended for failing to respond to two planes heading into @entity4 has told investigators that he had fallen asleep , according to the @entity7			1
the controller , a 20 - year veteran , " indicated that he had fallen asleep for a period of time while on duty , " according to a statement released thursday by the safety board			1
" he had been working his fourth consecutive overnight shift ( 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. )			0
" " human fatigue issues are one of the areas being investigated , " the statement read			0
@entity21 chief @entity20 said earlier thursday that the @entity21 and the @entity7 are investigating the incident and that the air traffic controller has been suspended from all operational duties			1
an @entity21 official speaking on background said the controller was given a drug test after the incident			1
the official said the drug test was " standard procedure " and did not know the results			1
the situation began at 12:10 a.m. wednesday , when an @entity34 plane attempted to call the tower to get clearance to land and got no answer , said @entity39 , a spokesman for the safety board			2
the plane had been in contact with a regional air traffic control facility , and a controller at that facility advised the pilot that he , too , had been unable to contact anyone at the tower , according to a recording of air control traffic at the website liveatc.net			1
" 1012 , " the controller said , using the airline 's flight number , " called a couple of times on landline and tried to call on the commercial line , and there 's no answer			2
" the tower is apparently unmanned			2
" apparently asked why by a pilot , the controller later responded , " well , i 'm going to take a guess and say that the controller got locked out			2
i 've heard of this happening before			0
fortunately , it 's not very often , " he said			0
@entity39 said the plane landed without incident in a situation termed an " uncontrolled airport			1
" about 15 minutes later , a @entity71 flight also failed to reach the tower but landed without any problems , he said			1
after that , the controller in the tower was back in communication			1
@entity39 said one controller was staffing the tower at the time this occurred			1
the controller 's admission that he was asleep during the landing emergency underscores concerns about the effect of fatigue on underslept controllers at work			1
in 2007 , then - @entity7 chairman @entity87 wrote in a letter to the @entity21 that four plane incidents " provide clear and compelling evidence " that controllers are sometimes operating while fatigued because of their work schedules and poor use of rest periods			1
" that fatigue has contributed to controller errors , " @entity87 wrote			2
the incidents cited by the @entity7 were : -- a march 23 , 2006 , incident in which a @entity101 air traffic controller cleared a plane to take off from a runway on which , 15 seconds earlier , he had cleared another aircraft to cross			1
the pilot of the departing plane stopped when he saw the other craft in the taxiway intersection			0
the controller told investigators he had slept only four hours during a nine - hour break between shifts			1
-- an august 19 , 2004 , incident in which a @entity116 controller cleared one passenger jet to take off and another to land on a runway at the same time			1
the pilot in the landing aircraft noticed the other on the runway and pulled his plane up 12 seconds before they would have collided			0
the controller said he had slept five or 6 hours before coming to work			2
-- a september 25 , 2001 , incident in which a @entity127 air traffic controller approved a request from a cargo plane pilot to take off from a runway that had been closed for construction			1
the aircraft came within 32 feet of hitting lights that had been installed in the construction zone			0
the controller said he 'd slept only two hours between work days			2
-- a july 8 , 2001 , incident in which a @entity127 controller cleared one passenger plane to cross a runway where another was about to land			2
the landing pilot hit the brakes , stopping 810 feet from the other plane			0
the controller said he had worked three shifts in two days			2
of the most recent incident , @entity20 said , " in my 25 years as a professional airline pilot , i 've never seen anything happen like this			0
" i am outraged by it , " @entity20 said			0
" we 're going to make sure something like this never happens again			0
" @entity20 stressed that , because of a backup system , neither plane was out of " positive radar contact , nor were they out of communication with the @entity21 , thus allowing both to land safely			1
" that said ... this should not have happened , " @entity20 said			0
" we should not have had this gap in communication			0
we had to rely on a backup system , which should n't have happened			0
" transportation secretary @entity167 ordered the @entity21 on wednesday to schedule two controllers on the overnight shift			1
" it is not acceptable to have just one controller in the tower managing air traffic in this critical air space			1
i have also asked ... @entity20 to study staffing levels at other airports around the country , " he said			0
@entity39 said it 's not uncommon for planes to land at uncontrolled airports			0
he said control towers at some fields across the country shut down for the night , and planes still land			0
however , he could not comment on whether that practice was ever used at @entity4			0
the @entity34 flight , which was coming from @entity189 , had 91 passengers and six crew members aboard , airline spokesman @entity187 said			0
the @entity71 flight was arriving from @entity101 with 63 passengers and five crew members , spokeswoman @entity192 said			0
@entity34 had no comment on the situation , saying it was leaving it to the @entity21 to handle			2
@entity71 noted that the @entity7 is reviewing the incident , and @entity192 said the airline is conducting its own review			1
@entity1 's @entity202 and @entity203 contributed to this report .			0
