@entity0 -- @entity3 's ruling @entity2 has expelled two former top officials from a southern @entity3 village where local residents rose up last year to protest corruption and abuses of land rights			1
@entity12 , the former party chief of @entity14 , and @entity15 , the former head of the village committee , are facing charges of corruption and election - rigging , the state - run news agency @entity10 said in a report late monday			1
other local officials were also punished , it said			1
the provincial authorities have also demanded that @entity12 and @entity15 return " illegal gains " worth tens of thousands of dollars , @entity10 reported , citing @entity24 , deputy head of the supervision department of @entity26			2
but some villagers said the punishment did not go far enough and urged the authorities to step up their investigations			2
during the last four months of 2011 , thousands of residents took to the streets of @entity14 , protesting the seizure of their farmland by officials , expelling local @entity2 leaders and clashing with anti-riot police who surrounded the village			1
the unrest drew the attention of the international news media , making it a focal point for grassroots discontent in @entity3			0
senior provincial officials intervened to negotiate a deal with the villagers			1
that agreement allowed the residents to hold elections to choose local representatives earlier this year , and protest leaders were elected to key posts			1
the provincial authorities also began investigating the former village officials and the land seizures			1
after three months , the investigators found that former officials were " involved in illegal transfers of land use rights , embezzling collective properties , accepting bribes and rigging village elections , " according to @entity24 , the @entity26 official			2
as well as @entity12 and @entity15 , 18 other village , township and municipal officials were also " punished , " @entity10 reported			1
two of those officials have been passed on to judicial authorities " for suspected law infringements , " and a total of 1.06 million renminbi ( $ 168,000 ) has been confiscated , the report said			2
but the announcement failed to satisfy @entity76 , a villager whose father died after being detained by the authorities during the protests last year			1
" the official report is not convincing , " she said by telephone			0
" none of us villagers would believe that a party chief would only take so little in so many years in his position			0
" the authorities have ordered @entity12 , the former party chief , to return 189,200 renminbi in " illegal gains , " and @entity15 , the former village committee head , to return 86,000 renminbi			2
@entity76 said the villagers ' main concern was not the punishment of the officials , but reclaiming what had been taken from them			0
" we still want to know whether we can have our land back , " she said			0
the investigation is continuing , the @entity10 report said , adding that @entity12 and @entity15 " may also be handed over to the judicial authorities			0
" @entity104 , one of the leading organizers of the protests in the village , said that the authorities needed to do more			1
" we feel the government is downplaying the problems here , " he said			0
" they were also slow and ineffective			0
" he agreed with @entity76 that @entity12 's current punishment was too lenient			0
" meanwhile , " he said , " we 'll keep fighting for our rights over the land			0
" @entity1 's @entity117 contributed to this report .			0
