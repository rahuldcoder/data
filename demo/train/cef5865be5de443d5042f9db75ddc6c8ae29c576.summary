@entity0 , @entity1 -- police early friday arrested 13 people suspected of trying to rebuild a youth wing of the outlawed @entity8 separatist group @entity7 , which was dismantled a year ago with dozens of arrests , the @entity3 said			1
the youth organization , also outlawed and known as @entity12 , is considered the " training ground for the terrorist group , " the ministry said in a statement			1
the latest arrests came as police continued their crackdown against @entity7 and its supporters , despite @entity7 's cease - fire of " armed offensive actions " announced last september 5			2
the @entity1 government and major political parties have said the cease - fire is not enough because @entity7 has broken them in the past			1
the government and the parties demanded a definitive statement from @entity7 to end its decades - long violence forever and lay down its arms under a verifiable disarmament process			2
@entity7 is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for @entity8 independence and is listed as a terrorist group by the @entity37 and the @entity38			2
three hundred police officers took part in the arrests friday of the 13 suspects , who are aged 20 to 29 and include at least one woman			0
the raids occurred in four northern @entity1 provinces with historic @entity8 roots and one in @entity49 , the ministry statement said			1
the youth organization @entity12 is blamed for fomenting so - called low - level street violence , such as the burning of municipal buses and automated teller machines , in support of @entity8 independence			0
authorities say that some of those activists later go on to become fully - fledged @entity7 members who carry out shootings and car bombings			0
in november 2009 , police arrested 34 suspected @entity12 leaders and considered that the youth wing had been largely dismantled at the time			0
before friday 's raids , police had already arrested about 20 suspected @entity7 members or collaborators since @entity7 's declaration on september 5 .			0
