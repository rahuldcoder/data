-- @entity1 wants to revolutionize transportation			1
the serial entrepreneur envisions a future where mag - lev trains in enormous pneumatic tubes whisk us from @entity8 to @entity9 in 45 minutes			1
need to be in @entity10 tomorrow ? no problem			0
it 's a two - hour ride away			2
as crazy as it sounds , @entity1 is merely updating an idea that 's been around since the early 1900s , and at least one company is working on a functional prototype			1
but according to @entity19 sources , his involvement wo n't be nearly as hands - on as @entity1 's other endeavors at @entity22 and @entity23			1
the engineering behind the @entity25 is similar to the old - school pneumatic tube systems used by banks to suck your deposit to the teller at the drive - through			2
but naturally , it 's more complicated than that			0
a massive vacuum tube — mounted either above ground or even under water — would be combined with a magnetic levitation system used on conventional bullet trains			2
that means no friction , no wind resistance , no chance of collisions , and insanely high speeds			0
@entity1 described the @entity25 as " a cross between a @entity46 , a railgun and an air hockey table , " at @entity51 's @entity50 conference earlier this year			2
and in an interview with @entity53 , @entity1 said the @entity25 could form a fifth tent pole of modern transportation , joining cars , planes , trains , and boats , adding that because of its low energy usage and ability to get juice from solar power , it could generate more power than it would consume			1
but up until now , he has n't elaborated on his involvement			0
@entity1 's interest in the idea was sparked after researching @entity69 's new high - speed rail project and realizing that it will be the slowest and — at $ 70 billion — the most expensive system on the planet			1
to his mind , there 's a better solution			0
and one firm unaffiliated with @entity1 is in the early stages of development			1
@entity79 , a company based in @entity80 , @entity81 , is working on a @entity83 ( @entity84 ) system , which it describes as " space travel on @entity86			1
" it uses two tubes — one for each direction — with 400 - pound , passenger car - sized capsules that could house six people , each accelerated by linear electric motors			1
according to @entity79 , state trips would average speeds of around 370 mph , while international trips would hit that insane 4,000 mph mark			0
the company , which calls itself an " open consortium , " claims that it 's working with partners in @entity100 and has sold nearly 100 licenses for the technology			0
but @entity104 s claims pose more questions than answers , particularly when considering you can buy your own license for the bargain basement price of $ 100			0
but the idea for a vacuum - sealed high - speed transit system is n't anything new			1
the " vactrain " concept was floated in the early 1910s and a paper written by physicist @entity116 and published by the @entity117 in 1972 titled the " @entity118 , " or @entity119 , describes something very similar to what @entity79 is developing			0
but where @entity1 fits in remains a question			2
sources close to the @entity22 co-founder and ceo say he believes @entity79 is on the right track , but is missing some key components , and that @entity1 has his hands full with @entity22 and @entity23 , and would rather have some involvement in the development , with another entity taking the helm			1
that lines up with a few responses @entity1 made on @entity136 when asked about patenting the technology			2
" i really hate patents unless critical to company survival , " @entity1 tweeted			1
" will publish @entity25 as open source			0
" when asked about partners , @entity1 said he 's " happy to work with the right partners			2
must truly share philosophical goal of breakthrough tech done fast & w / o wasting money on bs			0
" we 'll have to wait until august 12th to find out more			0

@entity1 wants to revolutionize transportation with high - speed trains in enormous pneumatic tubes
such trains could *theoretically* whisk people from @entity8 to @entity9 in 45 minutes
a @entity81 firm is in the early stages of development of such a system
@entity1 is the serial entrepreneur behind @entity22 , the electric car company , and @entity23
