@entity0 @entity3 officials and lawmakers reeling from the tragic terrorist attack in @entity6 that killed 12 are turning the attention back home as they assess what the attack means for @entity3 national security			1
@entity13 members privy to the @entity15 's top intelligence briefings criticized president @entity17 's terror - fighting policies and @entity3 national security agencies began scanning their databases thursday amid reports that the two gunmen in wednesdays ' attack traveled to @entity23 this summer and as suspicions swirled that the pair were influenced by @entity26			1
and one @entity13 lawmaker is staying away from criticizing @entity17 , instead introducing legislation to keep @entity3 who join terror groups off @entity3 soil			1
@entity3 officials have been in close coordination with @entity35 officials as the hunt for the two gunmen continued into thursday and @entity3 attorney general @entity38 will travel to @entity6 on sunday to meet with the @entity35 interior minister and others to discuss counterterrorism and the threat of foreign fighters			1
but earlier in the day , sens. @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 called out what they view as the failures of the @entity17 administration 's fight against terrorism after walking out of an unrelated intelligence briefing			2
" as long as @entity26 succeeds , that will breed this kind of terrorist who goes to @entity23 , @entity58 and fight , return to the country from which they came from -- not only radicalized , but well trained , " @entity44 , chairman of the @entity53 said			0
" and that is the reason why the administration is failing in not devoting the sufficient effort to destroy @entity26 which is what the president 's stated goal is ... when in fact there is no strategy to do so			0
" @entity44 has repeatedly slammed @entity17 's foreign policy as too timid and has called for a wider campaign in @entity58 and @entity23 to accomplish the president 's goal to " degrade and ultimately destroy " @entity26 , the militant group which has claimed broad swaths of territory in @entity58 and @entity23			1
the @entity3 is leading a coalitions of countries from @entity78 and the @entity79 in a military campaign centered around airstrikes and military advisers to bolster @entity58 security forces and combat @entity26			0
@entity17 has been repeatedly slammed for ruling out sending combat troops and criticized by @entity44 for not doing enough to help moderate rebels in @entity23			2
@entity44 suggested @entity17 does n't understand " the gravity " of the radical @entity91 threat , which @entity93 's sen. @entity92 and @entity94 's sen. @entity46 echoed , attacking the president 's past claims that the @entity3 has decimated @entity96 's core and is on the path to victory in the war on terror			1
@entity17 made those comments before the rise of @entity26 , a group which grew out of remnants of @entity96 leadership in @entity58			0
" despite the president 's assertion that the war on terror was over and that @entity96 was on the road to defeat , this is not accurate , " @entity46 said			0
and @entity92 focused on the growing threat of foreign fighters , thousands of which have left their homes in @entity78 and the @entity3 to fight in @entity23 -- some of whom risk returning to the @entity116 to carry out attacks			1
and amid suspicions that that was the case in @entity6 on wednesday , the @entity120 , @entity121 and intelligence agencies are evaluating high priority targets living in the @entity3 , including foreign fighters who may have returned to the @entity3 after fighting in @entity23			1
" whenever something like this happens you want to make sure you tighten things up , " a @entity3 official with firsthand knowledge of the efforts told @entity1			0
the attack in @entity6 is also giving new fire to legislation rep. @entity133 ( @entity134 ) believes will help prevent @entity3 who join @entity26 or other terrorist organizations from returning to the @entity3 @entity133 is reintroducing a bill in the coming days that will compel the @entity138 to revoke the passports of @entity3 who join or assist any foreign terrorist organization			1
@entity133 unsuccessfully pushed the legislation in the @entity143 in september , but he said the attack in @entity6 underscores the need for such legislation			1
" this tragedy in @entity6 lets us all know that homegrown terrorists exist all over the world , " said @entity133 , who is chairman of the subcommittee on homeland security			2
" they 're going to @entity23 , being trained and we do n't want them coming back into the @entity3			0
" sen. @entity155 will also reintroduce similar legislation in the @entity15 , his spokeswoman @entity154 told @entity1			0
the @entity157 @entity13 introduced a bill last year to strip @entity3 who join terrorist organizations of both their passports and their citizenship			1
reports indicate the pair of terrorists ( both @entity35 citizens ) traveled to @entity23 last summer and @entity133 suggested they would not have been able to return to @entity35 if similar legislation existed there			0
@entity1 law enforcement analyst @entity167 said revoking passports is an important tool , but the challenge will be determining whether an individual is actually joining a terror group			0
and with thousands of foreign fighters and hundreds of thousands on the terror watch list , @entity167 said people will inevitably slip through the cracks			2
@entity133 will also introduce two bills requiring the @entity138 in coordination with other agencies to submit reports on the flow of foreign fighters to @entity58 and @entity23 and terrorist groups ' use of social media , which groups like @entity26 have used to recruit and radicalize foreigners			1
@entity133 said he believes the @entity3 should work more closely with social media companies like @entity188 to purge sites of terrorist propaganda			2
" with what 's happened in @entity35 , @entity3 need to understand that this is an ongoing problem that we 're facing , " @entity133 said			2
@entity92 called the terrorist threat today greater than ever and said the @entity6 attack " reminds us that the terrorist threat is still very real for this country as well as for other @entity200 nations			0
" " the idea that the administration at one point said that core @entity96 had been decimated and that we were far safer is just not accurate , " @entity92 said			0
" and in all my time of studying homeland security issues and the terrorist threat i ca n't think of a time where the threat level is more dangerous			0
" @entity92 added that the @entity3 has greater capabilities today to thwart terror attacks , but that the expansive influence of @entity26 and other terror groups via the @entity214 and social media has created a " lone wolf problem , " which is harder to address			0
@entity3 and @entity35 law enforcement and intelligence agencies are still working to determine the circumstances behind the terror attack in @entity6 and whether the two brothers who attacked @entity35 publication @entity222 were acting on their own or with orders from a terrorist group , like @entity26 .			1
