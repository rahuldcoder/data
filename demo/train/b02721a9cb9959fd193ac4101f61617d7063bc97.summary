@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 wore the brave face the world associated with @entity1 's tsunami survivors			1
the march 11 catastrophe washed away all her earthly possessions			1
she watched as her hotel burned to the ground in a gas explosion triggered by the tsunami ; a hotel that had been in her family for generations			1
she was determined not to let the disaster break her			1
but after the elation of finding her son alive , the reality of losing her livelihood started to erode the calm facade			1
she was afraid to talk to other people about it because she knew everyone was suffering as much as her , if not more			1
they were " ganbaru , " she recalls -- enduring , holding on , withstanding , and living with the pain			2
she could n't be the only one to lose control			0
" i was in shock because i realized that all that was precious to me was gone , " she says , six months on from that terrible day			1
" i did n't know what to do from then on			0
" that was the start of a slippery slope down a dark trail of despair			0
it 's a familiar story in @entity0 , northeastern @entity1 , where the devastating earthquake and tsunami turned much of the town in @entity42 into rubble			1
today , much of that physical debris has been cleared away			0
but the emotional wreckage of the survivors is proving much more difficult to remove , as the mental scars from that day linger months later			1
in @entity3 's case , depression could have had tragic consequences for her had she not met @entity51 , a volunteer psychiatrist who listened patiently to her troubles one day at an evacuation center			1
@entity51 became the difference between life and death			0
she says she probably would have ended her life if the doctor had n't been there for her			0
" i was so moved by her approach to life , " recalls @entity51			0
" she may have been suffering and wanting to end her life because she had lost so much , but she also desperately wanted to get over that			0
i was moved by her willingness to get out of her own situation			0
i just helped her a little			0
" concerns about suicide and @entity70 ( @entity70 ) are growing among mental health specialists working in the region			1
@entity70 in particular , a condition which can push people over the edge if not addressed , can show up months after the initial shock			1
suicide is also a major concern in @entity1			1
according to the @entity78 , @entity1 has the fifth highest suicide rate in the world			1
more than 30,000 suicides are reported each year , according to the country 's national police agency , with @entity42 -- one of the regions hit hardest by the tsunami -- having one of the biggest problems			2
@entity89 , a psychologist and volunteer counselor , is part of a therapy group called " @entity93 300			2
" she and a number of other team members visit temporary villages in the devastated region hoping to treat symptoms of ptsd and ultimately prevent suicides			0
according to @entity89 , loneliness and despair take hold when the survivors move from their evacuation center to temporary housing			1
" it is only then that people see how their life has changed from their pre-disaster life , " she says			0
" the sense of loss and deep grief can overcome you quickly and if you are alone when that happens , you lose all hope for the future			0
i think this period is when they need help the most			0
" but getting help to the victims is proving to be a challenge in @entity1 , a country with limited experience in mental health care historically			1
@entity89 says the amount of psychological support received by tsunami victims now is a tenth of what the victims of 9/11 in the @entity129 experienced			2
according to @entity89 , the devastating 1995 earthquake in the city of @entity133 started to raise awareness about the effects of post-traumatic stress -- particularly among the younger generation -- but many @entity1 continue to find it difficult to talk about sorrow and loss because of the shame of appearing weak			2
@entity89 's strategy is to gather the residents in temporary housing for a regular get - together in a relaxed atmosphere			0
this gives her the opportunity to keep an eye on each of the participants , observing anyone that shows signs of severe distress			0
the hope is that what starts out as small talk will gradually evolve into people talking about themselves and their problems			2
but despite her efforts @entity89 is not optimistic about the region 's future with trauma			0
" we are only now starting to hear about sick or depressed people six months after the tsunami , " she says			1
she believes suicide rates will only increase			2
meanwhile , @entity3 vows not to be another victim			1
she says dr. @entity51 pulled her back from the brink and she is now making plans for the future			0
she wants to rebuild her hotel and give back to those who helped her			2
while @entity3 is a success story for @entity51 , he worries about those he will never reach in this devastated region			1
" now that i have met these people , i have grown attached to them , " he says			0
" it saddens me that there are still so many people suffering here			0
i ca n't stand the thought that there may be people who died because they had no - one to talk to			2

@entity3 became depressed after losing her hotel in march tsunami
she *contemplated* suicide after being afraid to talk to anyone about her troubles
she says a volunteer psychiatrist at an evacuation center saved her
mental health specialists are worried about the impact of the disaster months later
