editor 's note : a nationally syndicated columnist , @entity2 is the author of " listening to the @entity4 " and " speak , @entity5 ! a @entity7 's view of @entity8			1
" visit his web site for more information			2
he is host of " @entity11 " at 8 p.m. et on @entity12 while @entity13 is on maternity leave			2
@entity2 says @entity15 has served his sentence and should be allowed back on the field			1
( @entity12 ) -- when @entity15 completes home confinement in july , he will have served the 23 - month prison sentence imposed after he pleaded guilty to federal dogfighting charges			1
after his release from a @entity24 prison wednesday , he headed to his home in @entity26 to serve the final two months under home confinement , because all the beds at halfway houses in the area are taken			2
but that has n't deterred the @entity15 haters who are still in an uproar over the heinous details of his dogfighting kennel			1
yes , reading the details of the treatment of the dogs , including the killing of some of them , could make anyone sick			2
yet what 's the point of sentencing someone to jail , then having them serve their time and be released if we still want to imprison them for the rest of their lives ? frankly , i 'm sick of @entity8 who talk all day about " do the crime , then do the time , " then still want to treat a man like a criminal when he gets out of prison			1
this does n't just apply to @entity15			1
look at all the individuals who are sent to prison , get out and then ca n't find a job			1
why ? because they have the @entity65 on their record , which is a big fat " f " for felon			2
do n't think i 'm looking for any sympathy for someone who goes to jail			1
i firmly believe that you deserve all that you get for breaking the law			0
but listening to some of these zealots go on and on and on about @entity15 needing to continue to be punished is ridiculous ! the judge in @entity15 's case has imposed a number of restrictions			1
one of them is that he ca n't ever own a dog again			2
but to say the man should n't be allowed to play in the @entity84 is @entity85 the crimes of which he was convicted had nothing to do with playing sports			1
remember @entity90 star @entity89 ? when he was sent to jail for securities fraud , he was banned from working on @entity90 again			0
he was an insider and allowing him back into the financial game would have been atrocious			0
i get it when someone is convicted of molesting children that they ca n't live within a certain distance of a school or be left alone around children when released			2
but there is nothing related to @entity15 's crime that says he should not be allowed to play professional football			1
what is particularly galling is that , right now , you have any number of football players who have beaten people -- including their wives and girlfriends -- served time for drunk driving or committed other crimes , yet they have resumed their careers			1
the same goes for teachers , radio and television broadcasters , politicians and others			0
so is this any different because it involved dogs ? are we to say that the horrible treatment of dogs is vastly different than mistreatment of human beings ? the critics will likely say , " these men are role models			0
kids look up to them			0
they should have no business on the field			0
" yet some of these same kids are living with fathers and mothers who are felons			0
so are we supposed to remove them from the home as well ? enough with the public bullying			0
@entity15 was sentenced and served his time			1
and now he 's gotten out			0
if you want to be angry with him , fine			0
but please , cut the sanctimonious crap			0
he deserves to make amends and get on with his life			0
if you were in his shoes , you would want to do the same			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : by july , @entity15 will have finished his 23 - month sentence
he says some argue @entity15 should n't be allowed to play *due* to *severity* of his crime
he says the crime is n't connected to his career as a football player
@entity2 : we have to allow people who have served time to work *productively*
