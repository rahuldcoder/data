@entity0 , @entity1 -- the death toll from a @entity1 coal mine accident has reached 52 , with 38 people still missing , the @entity3 said tuesday			1
" the rescue operation to locate and recover the missing people is being carried out around the clock , " @entity7 , spokeswoman for the ministry , told @entity2			1
more than 80 survivors are currently in hospitals , according to the @entity1 @entity15 authorities			2
emergency situation minister @entity16 said more than 700 rescue workers are now combing numerous underground tunnels of the mine , and the plan is to complete the operation within the next 24 hours , according to the ministry 's website			1
he was speaking at a special meeting of the rescue headquarters in @entity26 , which was also attended by @entity1 prime minister @entity27 , who traveled to the region tuesday			2
@entity1 officials are still displaying hope and optimism in public , but several sources at the mine told @entity1 reporters on conditions of anonymity that finding anyone underground who survived the explosions would be a miracle			1
" @entity45 is always the last one to die , but there is indeed little hope left , " @entity40 , spokesman for the local regional @entity26 governor , told @entity2 on the phone from the site of the accident			0
@entity40 also said the first six funerals took place tuesday			0
five miners were buried in the town of @entity52 itself , where the accident took place , and one was buried in the town of @entity56 , also in @entity26			2
the gas explosion in the @entity59 mine occurred around 8:55 p.m. saturday ( 12:55 p.m. et ) , when 359 people were working at the time			1
the mine is located near the western @entity63 town of @entity52 , more than 2,300 miles east of @entity0 , @entity1			1
almost 300 people were evacuated shortly after the explosion			0
more than 50 rescue workers had gone into the mine to recover the rest of the victims when a second gas explosion rocked the structure about four - and - a - half hours later , officials said , causing more fatalities and destruction			1
dozens of miners and rescue workers were trapped as a result of that second , much more powerful explosion , and all communications with them were disrupted			1
thick smoke and high methane concentrations in the mine prevented active rescue operations underground on sunday and most of monday morning , @entity1 officials said			1
the operation was further complicated by the very size of the mine : @entity59 is one of the largest in @entity1 's mining industry			2
it has dozens of underground tunnels with a total length of almost 200 miles , according to @entity26 gov. @entity92			0
@entity27 said on @entity1 state television tuesday the investigation is closely analyzing all possible clues to determine the cause of the blasts			0
" when such disasters are investigated , attention is always given to studying all aspects of the problem , including the so - called human factor , which means unsafe handling of fire , " @entity27 said while talking to victims ' families			0
but once the groups of rescuers entered the mine after the first blast , he said , " there could have not been any unsafe handling of fire or equipment			0
it 's simply out of the question , " he said			0
" the second blast was the hardest			0
" the victims ' families will be paid 1 million rubles ( more than $ 33,000 ) in moral damages , and underage children of those killed in the accident will be paid a pension of 10,000 rubles ( more than $ 330 ) every month until they reach the age of 18 , the @entity1 government decided tuesday			2
the injured will receive 400,000 rubles ( more than $ 13,300 ) , and miners sustaining light injuries will receive 200,000 rubles ( more than $ 6,600 )			0
local authorities and the management of @entity59 mine will also allocate money to those affected , in addition to the federal government			0
