@entity1 @entity0 has skipped the usual full @entity1 media tour since launching a presidential exploratory committee late last year			1
he has done fewer than a handful of interviews , given one high - profile speech and has shied away from attacking other @entity8 who are considering a run in 2016			2
but that does n't mean @entity0 has been silent on issues			2
@entity0 , a 68 - year - old former senator and secretary of the navy , has been quietly outlining a 2016 platform -- on @entity16			1
for the last two - months , @entity0 has been tweeting about criminal justice reform , mental health issues and efforts to increase middle class incomes			1
he has urged the @entity21 to reshape its drug policies and outlined his views on leadership			0
what 's more , @entity0 has commented on news - of - the - day issues , like president @entity29 's decision to normalize relations with @entity31 , former @entity34 @entity33 's death and the release of @entity37 ' report on torture			1
@entity0 plans to continue this @entity16 - first strategy when he live tweets president @entity29 's @entity40 on tuesday , adding his observations and disagreements with the president in real time			1
while most of this has gone largely unscrutinized -- and @entity0 and his advisers are aware @entity16 ca n't be the only way a presidential candidate outlines a message -- advisers said @entity0 's @entity16 account is a fair representation of the platform @entity0 would run on if he chooses to jump into the race			1
" we can un-paralyze the environment and re-establish a transparent , functioning governmental system , " he said in december , linking to a number of policy positions on combating climate change			0
" why are so many @entity21 currently in prison compared with other countries and our own history , " he asked this month			0
@entity0 's tweets are noticeably very different than most politician 's tightly edited , concise messages			1
some , frankly , do n't make sense			0
but @entity0 's spokesman said the former senator writes all his own tweets and takes it " very seriously			1
" " it is not a bunch of propeller heads around him saying you should do that or this , " said @entity70 , @entity0 's new communication 's director whose hiring was announced on @entity16			1
" he likes to get his own message out and does n't do interviews just for the heck of it			0
he is his own guy			0
" @entity70 said @entity0 enjoys @entity16 more than giving speeches			1
" it is more a dialogue than a one way speech , " he said , adding that the former senator feeds off the responses he gets and reads all of them			0
" he approaches @entity16 as a conversation , " @entity70 said			2
" he did these prison reform tweets and it is an opportunity to build a conversation with followers that is a little different than a speech or an interview that is driven by whatever the questions are			2
i think he enjoys it			0
" so will @entity0 bypass the media and only try and reach voters through @entity16 in the coming months ? no , says @entity70 , who notes that @entity0 has received a list of media requests that " most politicians would dream about			2
" " he recognizes that interviews are part of the gig , " @entity70 said			0
" he is going to open up the doors before too long			0
