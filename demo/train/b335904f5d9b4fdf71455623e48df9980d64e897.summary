@entity0 , @entity1 -- bamboo , woven into the shape of human stomachs			0
@entity6 , sky blue and orange pencil shavings glued onto a large canvas form a woman 's traditional hair clip			2
a collage of magazine clippings , drawings and found materials depict @entity17 's tumultuous modern history			1
@entity21 's " @entity20 " depicts @entity18 , who is facing a genocide tribunal starting tuesday			1
these are a few of the offerings on hand in @entity0 at one of the first large international exhibitions of artists from @entity17			1
the work by 14 artists varies in practice -- video , photography , collage , wood shavings , paper , bamboo and painting -- as well as in themes , from reflecting on the @entity43 nation 's genocidal @entity41 regime to the emerging modern @entity17 , with traffic lights and all			1
" every artist in this show is referencing ancient tradition and recent history , " said @entity47 - based curator @entity46 , noting the wall - size depiction in folded paper of the serpent @entity50 ( which in @entity17 culture represents the people 's mythical birth ) to a collage of 20th - century @entity17 and its six different regime changes			1
" the show is looking at the present -- ' @entity64 ' is the title -- and it is this lineage of the past , you see that in the show , and then you see artists that arrive at the present , " she added			2
the show opens friday and runs through march 22 at 10 @entity73			0
gallery owner and director @entity74 said she believed it was important the artists get international exposure			2
" ... it 's really at the beginning of their art emergence			2
obviously , they 've had a very hard history , " she said			0
" this is really the beginning of contemporary @entity17 who are expressing very original ideas in their artworks and i think that that 's what makes it very unique and to show to the rest of the world			1
" @entity17 , which lost an estimated one - quarter of its population or at least 1.7 million people -- including an estimated 90 percent of its artists -- under the 1970s @entity41 regime , has a small but growing artistic community : there are some 50 practicing artists out of its 14 million people , @entity46 said			1
the genocide and ensuing war , which only ended in the last decade or so , stifled the development of the arts in one of the world 's poorest countries			1
" the legacy of that is now in every facet of a developing society , " said @entity46 , who noted the country had no art books when she arrived in 2002 on a fellowship to teach art history			0
" there 's an absence of infrastructure for them , there 's an absence of materials , there is no art store			0
... they are quite inventive about mixing materials to make them of a higher quality or last longer , but in many cases they do n't know archival techniques			0
" the harsh weather conditions -- a dusty , hot season and a rainy monsoon -- add to the trying work conditions			0
" everything 's against them , " she added			0
" their parents in many cases are coming from a really disadvantaged background , as the majority of the country is economically			0
" some of the art included in the show looks at the @entity17 of today , such as @entity21 's " @entity148 " -- an acrylic painting showing children in school uniform crossing a road with a yellow light , red light and three green lights , along with cows and roosters			1
the piece shows the changes in a country that recently got stop lights , with animals , people and traffic mingling on the main roads of the capital			0
@entity167 , a @entity169 whose family migrated to the @entity170 in 1984 , works with bamboo and rattan -- materials often used in @entity17 traditional farming and crafts -- to make sculptures			1
his work , " cycle 2 , " is the joining of the stomachs of an infant and an elderly person that for him brought up ideas of @entity17 traditional village life			1
" you belong to each other , you help each other out , " he said			0
" but also , if you look at the lines and you see how it 's shaped by hand , it 's not very perfect , so it 's also about struggle ... " you could say it 's a cycle of trying to hold onto each other , now we are living everywhere in the world , @entity17 are all over the planet , " he added			1
" all this technique and pattern that i am quite obsessed with ... it 's about this idea of trying to hold on with very simple means			0
" @entity205 , a 25 - year - old artist who graduated from one of the country 's three art schools , creates textured patterns that appear almost like tapestry using pencil shavings in various colors			2
the works on display in the show are from a series based on @entity17 architectural decor , such as door and window shutter carvings , and include ancient @entity221 forms whose shapes are derived from nature			1
" when i started learning art , the teacher introduced a lot of new ways of making art , new ideas that were very difficult for me , so i had to think a lot , " he said through a translator			0
" so then i looked around at what my classmates were doing and i started to think about what they were n't using for their work , so i started to collect the things that they did n't use when they were making art and started to think about my way of making art using those materials			0
" " i like the first piece i did ( using the pencil shaving technique ) because i had never done it this way before and since then i kept on making it , " he said			0
the younger artists " seem to be expressing something more fresh , " while the work by artists from the older generation is " much more heavy , " de @entity74 said			2
some of the works of the @entity41 period include a painting by @entity255 , one of seven people to survive the regime 's infamous s - 21 torture prison			1
his painting , " @entity260 , " depicts women wearing traditional @entity17 funeral scarves praying en masse under troubled skies by stormy seas			1
another work , @entity266 's " @entity20 , " tells the life of @entity18 , a former teacher who ran @entity257 and goes on trial tuesday before a @entity270 - backed tribunal on charges that include crimes against humanity			1
the art scene has been growing slowly in the @entity17 capital of @entity47 over the last few years : @entity167 started a group to promote contemporary @entity17 art practices and two art institutes offer programs apart from the @entity280			2
one factor that has also made @entity17 contemporary artists different from their counterparts , for example in neighboring @entity286 , has been the lack of outside influence , such as was the case with @entity1 contemporary art 30 years ago , @entity281 said			1
" @entity17 still is very much influenced by itself and so the development is happening on a slower pace but as well very interesting , " she said			2
" they seem to not have as much international exposure to materials , magazines , publications , so you really do feel -- it was the same just after the @entity301 in @entity1 -- that they did n't have exposure to many publications and things , and so their art was developing at that moment in time			0
" " ... it 's very interesting to document it and see what 's going to happen in the future , " she said			0
part of the exhibit will be shown at another of the gallery 's venues in @entity0 and will run through april 25 .			0
