@entity0 -- radiation readings near tanks holding toxic water at @entity7 's crippled nuclear power plant have jumped to a new high , the plant operator said wednesday			1
@entity8 , which has been struggling to deal with a series of leaks at the @entity12 nuclear plant , said it detected a radiation level of 2,200 millisieverts near the tanks on tuesday			1
that 's up from a previous high of 1,800 millisieverts on saturday			1
those levels , detected around the same tank , are strong enough to kill an unprotected person within hours			1
but @entity8 said the type of radiation is easy to shield against			0
how did we get to this point ? the announcement of the increased reading came a day after the @entity7 government officially stepped into the effort to deal with the contaminated water crisis at the @entity12 plant , which was severely damaged by the massive earthquake and tsunami that struck northeast @entity7 in march 2011			1
the government said tuesday that it would spend the equivalent of $ 470 million on measures that included an ambitious plan to freeze the ground surrounding the plant 's stricken reactors to prevent the contamination of groundwater at the site			0
@entity8 has accumulated a vast volume of tainted water in roughly 1,000 huge storage tanks at the site , some of them hastily assembled in the aftermath of the tsunami			0
more leaks feared at @entity12 and the amount of radioactive water at the plant keeps growing day by day , as groundwater seeps in and the company pumps liquid around the damaged reactors to keep them cool			0
last month , @entity8 said one of the tanks at the site had leaked 300 tons of toxic water , prompting @entity7 's nuclear regulator to declare the situation a @entity64 serious incident , its gravest assessment since the reactor meltdowns at the plant in 2011			0
@entity8 looks for outside help to stabilize crippled @entity12 nuclear plant the nuclear watchdog , the @entity71 , said this week that the recent high radiation readings have raised suspicions of more leaks from other water containers			2
@entity8 said wednesday that it had n't found any leaks from this tank and that the cause of the high radiation reading was under investigation			2
@entity7 fed up with ' whack - a - mole ' approach to @entity12			0

@entity8 says it measured radiation of 2,200 millisieverts at the plant
the reading came from near a tank holding contaminated water
the previous highest reading around that tank was 1,800 millisieverts on saturday
those levels are strong enough to kill an unprotected person within hours
