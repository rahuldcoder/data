@entity0 , @entity1 -- a three - man @entity4 delegation wo n't return to @entity1 until monday , when it will ask self - declared president @entity7 to relinquish his post or face a military ouster , a representative of the group said friday			1
but @entity7 remained defiant in his claim that he won a november 28 election fairly -- a claim disputed by challenger @entity15 and a growing international bloc that has recognized him as the winner of the presidential runoff election			1
@entity15 and @entity7 , the incumbent , set dueling deadlines for the other to stand down , but neither show any signs of doing so			1
@entity23 , a minister in @entity7 's cabinet , ordered @entity15 out of @entity0 by saturday			1
" if you ( @entity15 ) do n't do it by the first of january , when that day passes , i can no longer be responsible for the security of the people at the @entity33 , " said @entity23 , a minister in @entity7 's cabinet , whipping supporters into a frenzy at a rally wednesday			1
the @entity33 is where @entity15 has been holed up since the election			2
" i ask the people of @entity1 to be ready with their bare hands to remove @entity15 ! " @entity23 said			1
a spokesman for @entity15 said that @entity15 told @entity4 leaders at a meeting earlier this week that he was willing to offer @entity7 amnesty in return for ceding power , setting a midnight friday deadline			1
@entity15 set the december 31 deadline thinking that the @entity4 leaders representing the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) would return to @entity1 on thursday , said his spokesman , @entity47			1
the three - man delegation , however , is not set to travel back to @entity0 until monday , when it will again ask @entity7 to step down , @entity49 defense spokesman col. @entity48 said friday			1
@entity47 said the @entity46 leaders asked @entity15 to spell out the conditions under which he would be willing to see @entity7 leave quickly and peacefully			1
" he offered to give @entity7 amnesty and other conditions related to a former head - of - state status but he said that these offers will be only available if former president @entity7 is ready to recognize that he has lost elections , " @entity47 said			1
@entity15 , said @entity47 , " still wants the crisis to be over as quickly as possible " and hopes it will not extend beyond monday			1
if the @entity46 appeal to @entity65 fails again , the regional bloc 's defense committee will meet in @entity66 january 17 - 18 to finalize a military option and then report back to the heads of state , @entity48 said			1
military force is a last resort , @entity48 said , adding that it 's hoped @entity7 will step down peacefully			1
the crisis began when the @entity73 declared @entity15 the winner of the runoff , followed by the @entity4 nation 's @entity77 's declaration that @entity7 was the winner			1
meanwhile , in an interview with @entity81 , @entity7 called for @entity15 to support a recount of the runoff vote and declared there was no reason for him to step aside			1
" it must be understood that ( the @entity73 's declaration ) was an illegitimate result which was prematurely declared by a body that had no right to do so , " he said			0
" it 's on this point that the west is digging its heels in			0
after the vote , the @entity77 meets and gives the result			0
it declares who is the elected president , and that was me			0
it 's not open to debate			0
" earlier this week , an @entity46 delegation consisting of presidents @entity102 of @entity103 , @entity104 of @entity105 and @entity106 of @entity107 met with @entity7 in @entity0			1
but their pleas for him to leave office were in vain			0
meanwhile , human rights activists grew increasingly concerned about politically motivated violence in @entity1			2
the @entity114 , @entity115 , sent individual letters to " a group of leaders in key authority positions " to remind them " in the strongest terms " that they will be held " personally accountable for human rights violations			0
" " the international criminal justice system that has developed over the past 15 or so years has given us a tool of accountability we did not have before , " @entity115 said			0
" no longer can heads of state , and other actors , be sure that they can commit atrocious violations and get away with it			2
" the letter was sent to @entity7 and the commanders of the @entity132 , the marines and security forces			2
" we have received reports of at least two mass graves ; however , @entity114 human rights teams have been denied access to the scenes of these atrocities in order to investigate them , " @entity115 said			0
" denying access to alleged mass grave sites and places where the victims ' mortal remains are allegedly deposited constitutes a clear violation of international human rights and humanitarian law			0
" the @entity114 refugee agency said friday that more than 18,000 refugees have fled the country for neighboring @entity154			0
in @entity157 , @entity156 officials informed @entity158 , the man sent by @entity7 as his ambassador to @entity156 , that he is no longer recognized in the position as of friday			1
he immediately loses his diplomatic status , privileges and immunities , the @entity156 @entity161 said			0
" we will be moving to recognize the appointee of president @entity15 in the usual manner , " the office said in a statement			2
earlier this month , representatives of @entity171 countries agreed to only accept ambassadors appointed by @entity15			2
@entity173 is reviewing the credentials of the @entity15 appointee , and @entity176 has said it would accept the new president 's ambassador			2
@entity173 has renewed its call for citizens -- especially those with children -- to leave @entity1 as soon as possible , the @entity179 said friday			2
@entity173 last week warned of dangers in the @entity4 nation			0
" although foreigners have not so far been directly threatened , the @entity187 authorities renew their advisory to defer plans for trips to @entity1 , and to all the @entity187 who can ... to temporarily leave @entity1 until the situation normalizes , " the foreign ministry said in a statement friday			2
the @entity196 and @entity156 also have warned their citizens of possible violence			0
the @entity199 has ordered non-emergency personnel and family members to leave @entity1			0
it also warned @entity196 citizens against traveling there			0
the @entity156 @entity161 also had advised @entity156 citizens to avoid travel to @entity1 and , for those already there , to leave the country unless they " have a pressing reason to remain			0
