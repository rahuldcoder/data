@entity1 he 's an embattled prime minister and he does n't deny it			2
so when @entity5 's @entity4 faced journalists and his colleagues to deliver a highly anticipated speech in @entity9 on monday , he fessed up and begged for time			1
seen as tricky , mean and unwilling to keep his promises , the @entity5 leader has been under pressure recently to resign			1
to stem the criticism , @entity4 offered a few olive branches : more consultation with his colleagues , more control over foreigners buying in to the property market in @entity5 's major cities and a crackdown on @entity24 groups sympathetic to @entity25			1
throughout , however , he made it clear he was staying put			2
since his election in september 2013 , @entity4 has accumulated more critics than supporters			1
a litany of broken promises and a stalled budget have left his achievements looking parlous			2
he had promised there would be no cuts to health , education and pensions , nor the national broadcasters , @entity40 and the @entity41			2
all have since faced reduced funding			2
his first budget has been hijacked by minor party objections and horse - trading			2
many measures remain stuck in the @entity47 , the upper house of the @entity5 parliament			1
he 's managed to keep one of his central promises : to dump a carbon tax introduced by @entity53 , the predecessor he maligned for breaking promises			0
and his government can be fairly said to have stopped the boatloads of asylum seekers making their way to @entity5 from @entity61 ports			1
this was achieved after several years , during which up to 1,000 people died on the journey			0
however , even that achievement has come at a cost to his personal reputation			0
sending asylum seekers to @entity5 - run camps in @entity71 and @entity72 has ended in riots and one death			1
when he honored prince @entity78 , the husband of the @entity79 , with a knighthood , the fuse of national anger ignited			0
he is appearing to be a tin - eared leader , out of touch with ordinary @entity5			1
@entity83 took the opportunity to slap down his conservative allies by throwing them out of office in a statewide election last weekend			0
@entity88 had begun , worsening after the @entity90 poll , that @entity4 would be dumped if he refused to resign			1
half stump speech , half stock - taking on the government 's achievements , his public appearance at the @entity96 is unlikely to placate his most ardent critics , who now include many conservative commentators			1
poll after poll reveals the extent of his unpopularity			0
a @entity105 / @entity104 poll taken in late january shows the government would lose the next election by a landslide , based on current figures			0
@entity4 's personal approval rating has nosedived too			1
the two cabinet ministers most often talked about as likely to challenge him for the top job have pledged loyalty , albeit in muted tones			0
@entity4 did n't deny he had sought an assurance of loyalty from his deputy , foreign minister @entity117			1
" i accept this is a government which has gone through a difficult patch			0
all governments go through difficult patches , " he said			0
" this will be a test of character			0
now , politicians pass the test when they do what is best for the long term , not when they give in to short term fear and make a difficult situation worse			0
" as for @entity117 , she 's a friend of mine			0
she 's been a terrific deputy and a terrific minister			0
i believe i have her support and i certainly look forward to continuing to have that			0
" on his other rival , communications minister @entity138 , there was silence			0
@entity138 is a popular figure and the preferred conservative leader for those who vote for the opposition , the @entity144			2
however , @entity138 's pro-climate change , pro-same sex marriage stance makes him a difficult alternative for his own party to accept as leader			2
for the moment , @entity138 is toeing the line and publicly stating he supports his leader			1
given the frenzy of anger and disappointment unleashed against @entity4 over the past week , and the anticipation attached to monday 's appearance , it was clear the prime minister would never be able to achieve the bar set for him			1
in the end , he did all that he could do			0
he begged his colleagues to stick with him and warned @entity5 that , if they followed @entity90 ( and before it @entity164 , which also recently turfed out a conservative government ) , they 'd face the re-introduction of a carbon tax			1
wiping it from the statute books , he says , has saved the average @entity5 household $ 500 a year			1
it might sound glib to assert that $ 500 a year is all that stands between @entity4 , prime minister and @entity4 , washed up politician			1
but given his nemesis @entity138 has long advocated action on climate change , it 's truer than it sounds .			0

facing criticism from all sides , @entity5 leader @entity4 begs for more time
low approval ratings and state - level *drubbings* are taking their toll
*perceived* rivals publicly backing him *--* for now
