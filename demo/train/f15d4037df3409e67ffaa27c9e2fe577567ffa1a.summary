-- three - month - old @entity1 has redefined what it means to be a miracle baby			1
she was born while her mother was technically dead			2
in february , @entity6 was teaching at a high school in @entity8 , @entity9 , when she walked into a co-worker 's classroom			1
@entity1 said she felt faint , placed her hands on a table to steady herself and then passed out			1
three teachers immediately grabbed a defibrillator and also began performing cpr			1
kids in the classroom ran out , yelling for help			2
@entity1 's husband , @entity20 , also a teacher , was just two doors down			1
he rushed into the room			0
" @entity6 was lying on the floor , she was foaming and making gurgling sounds and just staring up , " he told @entity0 affiliate @entity23			1
" my wife is pregnant , " he said , his breath heavy with panic			0
" she 's having a seizure ! the baby 's due in three weeks ! " " oh my @entity33 ! " the 911 operator exclaimed			1

@entity49 printer helps save dying baby over the next five days , she remained in a medically induced coma , she told @entity0 , and doctors diagnosed her with a heart defect she did n't know she had -- hypertrophic cardiomyopathy			1
