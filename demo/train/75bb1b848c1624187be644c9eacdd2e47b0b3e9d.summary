@entity0 -- when @entity3 wrote " @entity4 , " the 1939 novel about the plight of tenant farmers driven from their @entity9 home , he was intending in his own words to " rip a reader 's nerves to rags			1
" in doing so , the @entity15 author was also fulfilling what @entity17 researchers have proved , that literature mirrors the economic conditions of the previous decade			1
the so - called " @entity24 , " devised by statisticians at @entity26 , shows how often words associated with sadness appeared in print , year by joyless year			1
they compared their index to a standard " @entity28 " -- based on rates of unemployment and inflation -- and concluded that there is a link between the two			1
the study , made public on a dreary day in january , showed a distinct correlation -- with an 11 - year delay -- between the two indices			2
in other words , about a decade after you have an economic crisis -- you tend to get more expressions of sadness in literature			1
the heavy - hearted conclusion : hard times make for miserable books			1
so phrases like " a sorrow here that weeping can not symbolize ... " is just what @entity3 should have been writing in 1939 , 10 years after the @entity51 known as black tuesday , and at the end of a wretched decade for the @entity54 economy that saw a severe decline , double - digit unemployment , drought and dustbowl			1
and the painfully high inflation and unemployment of the 1970s and early 1980s may have had an influence on @entity62 , whose first novel , " @entity63 , " came out in 1985			2
" @entity68 " and " darkness " runs through the novel , whose motto is " @entity67			2
" " @entity71 calls me the next night and tells me that he 's feeling depressed ... " writes @entity62 , as @entity70			0
the researchers contend that it 's not only novels which are influenced by economic despondency			1
the research includes all types of publications			1
of the millions of books used in the study , only around 10 % were fiction			1
it means biographies , histories -- maybe even cook books -- which were written in the aftermath of economic decline will statistically speaking contain more " sad " words ... like " sorrow " , " weeping " or " melancholy " , professor @entity90 , @entity91 , at @entity26 , said : " to me the study confirms that we do have a collective memory that conditions the way we write , and that economics is a very important driver of that			1
" maybe that 's why they call it the " dismal science			0
" even though @entity3 was writing about @entity54 in the 1930s -- " @entity4 " contains many themes which will have a grim resonance for today 's readers			0
" the bank is something else than men			0
it happens that every man in a bank hates what the bank does , and yet the bank does it			0
the bank is something more than men , i tell you			0
men made it , but they ca n't control it			0
" ( " @entity4 " ) while that passage does n't include any of the sad words ( the mood is more the " wrath " of the novel 's title ) , it taps into the collective consciousness of @entity54 just as any of the " sad " adjectives might			1
@entity3 's book was definitely intended to expose the excoriating cruelty of the @entity136			0
this study says that even authors who are n't ostensibly writing about conditions in the economy are somehow infusing their experiences into their work			2
our most recent financial and economic crisis began in earnest with the fall of @entity147 in september 2008 and many people around the world today are still experiencing the effects			2
@entity54 unemployment hit 10 % in october 2009 -- and it 's only now beginning to fall to more " acceptable " levels			0
so it seems , going by this study , that we are in for a miserable few years in literature			2
the dreary deluge should begin in around 2018			0
by then , the economy may be in a better place			0
novelists will still be working it out			0
and if your new recipe book sounds a little bit depressing -- now you know why .			0
