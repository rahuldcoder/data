@entity5 , @entity2 a dispute over natural gas supply flared friday between @entity9 and @entity2 , even as a ceasefire between @entity2 forces and @entity4 separatists in eastern @entity2 appeared to be taking hold			1
both sides in the conflict have begun withdrawing their heavy weaponry from the front line of the conflict , in line with a peace deal agreed to in @entity18 , @entity19 , two weeks ago			1
there has also been a reduction in the fighting between the two sides , although some artillery fire can still be heard			2
but the ceasefire remains fragile			0
a spokesman for @entity2 president @entity27 cited him as saying on @entity28 : " we starting withdrawing only some of the heavy weaponry			2
@entity2 military are ready to return the equipment to the front line any time			0
" the leader of the self - proclaimed @entity35 , @entity36 , said separatist forces there had withdrawn 90 % of their heavy weapons			1
but he also warned that they reserved the right to return the weapons to the front line if authorities in @entity45 did not keep their end of the bargain			0
a @entity6 team on the ground saw a small convoy of artillery , flying the yellow - and - blue flag of @entity2 , heading south out of the conflict zone thursday			2
the separatists began the withdrawal of heavy weapons a couple of days earlier			1
under the terms of the @entity18 agreement , the two sides have until monday to complete the withdrawal and create a buffer zone of at least 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) for heavy weapons			1
the @entity62 in @entity63 is tasked with monitoring the ceasefire and the withdrawal			0
@entity2 's @entity67 and @entity66 said friday that three @entity2 troops had been killed and seven injured in the past 24 hours in continued clashes			0
meanwhile , @entity9 energy minister @entity71 warned that @entity9 energy giant @entity72 could cut the supply of natural gas to its neighbor in the coming days if payment is not received			1
@entity9 's @entity78 state news agency said that @entity72 confirmed receiving $ 15 million friday in prepayment from @entity2			1
but that is enough to pay for only a day 's supply of natural gas , the news agency said			1
a meeting between the @entity84 , @entity9 and @entity2 is due to take place in @entity86 , @entity87 , on monday to discuss gas supply to @entity2			1
@entity9 has used gas as a weapon before , cutting off supplies to @entity2 three times in the past decade			1
a new dispute could affect the rest of @entity63			0
about a third of the @entity84 's natural gas comes from @entity9 , and 15 % flows through @entity2			1
however , now that the worst of winter is over , the threat of a halt in the supply of gas is less alarming than it was for @entity2 and for the rest of @entity63			2
in any case , @entity45 has reserve gas supplies that could be used if the supply from @entity9 were stopped			2
@entity63 also has the option of reverse supply -- sending gas back through pipelines into @entity2			1
the latest disagreement comes against the backdrop of an @entity84 investigation into @entity72 , which is due to report soon			0
@entity63 has accused @entity72 of using its dominant position to manipulate prices and hinder the free flow of gas across the continent			0

the chief monitor for the @entity125 mission to @entity2 , @entity126 , reported some progress in implementing the @entity18 agreement as he briefed the council , but said much remained to be done			1
" for the past days , combat operations have been significantly reduced across the conflict zone , although some violence has still occurred around @entity5 airport , as well as close to the town of @entity137 , " he said			0
" as to the withdrawal of heavy weapons , yesterday our monitors began observing the movement of heavy weapons away from the line of contact on several instances			1
" however , the @entity125 needs more information in order to monitor their withdrawal effectively , he said , including what heavy weapons each side has , where they are now and where they will be taken			1
there are currently 451 civilian monitors in @entity2 , he said , of whom more than 300 are in the contested @entity5 and @entity158 regions			0
the mission will need more technological resources , such as drones , in order to cover a huge area of operations extending about 50,000 square kilometers ( 19,300 square miles ) , including large stretches of the @entity9 - @entity2 border , he said			1
more hubs may also have to be set up for @entity125 patrols			0
@entity126 also highlighted the plight of more than 1 million people forced from their homes within @entity2 , " some of them living in desperate circumstances			0
" @entity9 foreign minister @entity176 , speaking friday at his ministry 's @entity174 , said : " impartial observers , including the @entity178 in @entity63 , have registered a significant reduction in the exchange of fire , so the ceasefire is nonetheless yielding a result			2
" but he stressed that although some progress has been seen in the withdrawal of heavy weapons , " it is important to consolidate it			1
" he also warned that @entity2 must keep its nonaligned status " in order to keep the stability in @entity63			0
" @entity9 is unhappy about what it sees as @entity193 's expansion toward its western border			0
@entity2 is not a @entity193 member , but @entity197 nations bordering @entity9 belong to the alliance and @entity199 also hopes to join			2
@entity2 and the @entity200 accuse @entity9 of arming and training the separatists , as well as sending @entity9 troops over the border to fight with them			2
