@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 had been one of the @entity4 's biggest draws for half a decade by the time her career crashed to a halt			1
the minute @entity7 -- praised as " a dancer of seeming fragility , delicacy and radiance " by @entity12 -- was rehearsing in 2008 , when she was flipped by her partner , skewed awkwardly and slammed to earth			0
she suffered severe whiplash and a prolapsed disc in her spine and was forced to rest for over a year			0
at 25 , doctors told her she would need surgery , and would never dance at the highest level again			0
the battle behind ballet 's graceful pirouettes are grueling feats of training and endurance that push dancer 's bodies to their extremes			1
rest is a rare luxury			0
some dancers perform 200 to 250 days a year , leaving just over 100 days to train and recover			2
rehearsals can require 10 hours a day on the floor			0
it is hardly surprising that critics often refer to dancers -- especially the hard - worked young apprentices in the corps -- as the " foot soldiers " of ballet			1
four out of five will suffer a severe injury during the course of their dancing career -- and two out of those four will never fully recover			0
injuries , more often than not , are the result of fatigue and repeated strain on muscles and joints , rather than unpredictable accidents			0
even in cases like @entity57 's , fatigue can be the root of the disaster -- as one exhausted dancer 's lapse in concentration often translates into another dancer 's injury			2
physiotherapy for recovering dancers is well entrenched -- and organizations such as the @entity68 and @entity69 and the @entity70 and @entity69 have done a lot to advance knowledge of health issues among the big ballet companies and schools that feed them			1
but , beyond that , dancers benefit from few of the scientific breakthroughs that have so improved the safety record of their athletic counterparts on the sports field			2
ballet science @entity85 is the 33 - year - old former karate champion fighting to change all that			1
@entity87 -- a broad - chested , broadly smiling @entity88 -- is the subject of " dance , sports science and @entity85 , " a new short documentary produced by @entity93 and directed by @entity94			1
first screened at the @entity96 ballet competition in february , in the film @entity85 buzzes with enthusiasm as he documents his work rehabilitating leading dancers -- including world - famous principals @entity101 and @entity104 , and the @entity106 's artistic director @entity105 -- and his light - handed attempts to start a revolution in dance health			1
the @entity87 approach is to consider the whole picture -- compiling data to track everything : from what the dancer eats and how much weight they can lift , to the angle of their leg as they glide through the air			0
" it 's actually sports sciences , " he says , emphasizing the plural			2
" it 's , for example : biomechanics , which is kind of like physics for the body			2
it 's anatomy , physiology			2
it 's about training science , movement and exercise science , psychology , nutrition ... " he goes on			1
in practice , this means watching each dancer intimately and building a computer profile of their performance based on multitude of different measures			0
a dancer might be videoed as he or she prepares to leap -- recorded in slow motion , with two lasers beaming data back to a laptop on height jumped , time taken to get off the ground , and more			0
when @entity87 opens up his laptop screen , grid - squares line up with a young dancer 's arrow - straight right leg , and betray a miniature kink in the left			2
the data readouts show he is jumping 5cm less than he was before injury			0
@entity85 takes this visual micro-analysis and adds dietary guidance , strength and stamina - building weight training , and scheduled recovery periods , all of which he imported from his knowledge of the world of sport			1
this way , he begins to build a personalized regime capable of restoring dancers from injury , and -- he hopes -- keeping them healthy when they recover			2
resistance when asked if his methods have face resistance from those in the ballet world , his usual smiling face drops momentarily , and he exhales : " yeah , a lot			0
" he 's used to hearing the complaint from ballet company directors that ( he recalls ) " they are sports and we are art , and it does n't go together			1
" ballet instructors are often reluctant to see their dancers head into the weight room fearing that they will develop bulging muscles and lose the characteristically spindly look , traditionally considered ideal			1
and it has been harder still to break the ingrained code of silence that exists among dancers -- where fierce competition ensures they often conceal injury or weakness for fear of missing out on the best roles			1
" at first , they thought we were the enemy ! " says @entity85 with a chuckle			1
" this part where we said : ' let 's have regular tests , where we can clearly see : okay , is there something wrong ? is there weakness ? is there an imbalance between left and right , for example ? ' " that scared them a lot ... , " he says , adding that many feared he would feed information back to directors about dancers ' hidden frailties			1
" you ask them about nutrition -- and in ballet there are problems with eating disorders -- and people get very scared and say ' i do n't want to tell you about that			0
' " they are not used to that process , because for years it has been [ kept ] very , very quiet			0
" results when @entity85 was recruited to work with @entity3 , he set about providing a speedy response to critics ' fears			2
knowing nothing about the dancer , he searched @entity250 for videos : " just on what i saw on the video , i asked her a few questions and asked her ' could it be that there 's an underlying problem here and there , " he says , pointing to two spots			0
" nobody i ever told that , [ nobody ] knew ! " she said			0
" i 've had that for quite a while and i tried to cover it			0
" guided by @entity85 , @entity57 recovered from surgery and addressed the underlying issues -- defying doctors ' predictions and returning to the stage within six months			1
of her comeback performance , the @entity12 wrote : " ms. @entity3 's " @entity277 " was one of the great dance renditions of our time ... " by this point , many of the big companies were won over -- with the @entity281 , @entity4 , @entity106 , and others leading the way			1
@entity85 now plans to spread his approach from ballet companies , to dance schools and beyond by compiling @entity287 -- a diverse team of sports scientists who will offer his all - round approach			1
as @entity57 testifies , it will be a move welcomed by dancers : " to be on stage and not feel pain ... it 's a wonderful , wonderful miracle , " she says			1
" the enjoyment of dancers is going to be so much higher -- and the competition for me will be so much bigger ! "			0

ballet dancers fight through pain to perfect their art , and are often seriously injured
@entity85 is taking revolutionary training *techniques* from sport to the ballet stage
@entity85 works with dancers at the @entity4 , the @entity281 , and others
but can he break ballet 's notorious " code of silence " ?
