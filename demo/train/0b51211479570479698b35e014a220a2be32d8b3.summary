-- after traveling seven hours in the @entity2 he drives for work , @entity1 was n't overly concerned when he started feeling as if his legs were asleep -- stinging and vaguely numb			2
it 's probably because you did n't get out of the car enough , @entity5 remembers telling her husband , before the pair went about their day in 2007			1
later that week , with the numbness in @entity1 's legs still coming and going , @entity5 sat down to watch the episode of " the @entity15 " that would eventually help save her husband 's life			1
with boundless health information available at the click of a tv remote or computer mouse , patients such as @entity5 and @entity1 have come to rely on these media as they would a doctor 's visit			1
see , the next morning , after the couples ' two sons headed off to school , @entity5 and @entity1 thought to take romantic advantage of their empty @entity30 , @entity31 , home			1
but for the first time in their more than 20 years together , @entity1 was n't able to perform			2
then @entity5 had a thought			1
dr. @entity35 had spoken about symptoms that precede a heart attack on @entity39 's show the day before -- one of which was erectile dysfunction because of slowed blood flow			1
@entity1 was no stranger to indigestion , and the couple had previously disregarded the pressure he felt in his abdomen -- yet another sign that a heart attack could be looming			2
" there 's a lot of useful information that people get from tv , " said dr. @entity50 , assistant professor of medicine at @entity52			1
" but [ tv personalities ] can carry so much influence on patients , that sometimes [ the patient ] ... will ask for tests that they may not necessarily benefit from			0
" same goes for the @entity64			0
the term cyberchondria -- a digital age - play on hypochondria -- has been tossed around since the early - to - mid 2000s , when searching symptoms online became commonplace			1
" dr. @entity70 has certainly sent me his share of referrals , " @entity50 jokes			1
" a lot of my patients do a preliminary search , and get frightened by something they read			0
they 'll go to the doctor for something they would n't have initially gone for			1
" that 's what @entity5 and @entity1 worried about as they spoke with the paramedics at their home			1
but @entity1 agreed to go to the hospital , despite his perfect electrocardiogram and slightly high blood pressure			0
" part of me was thinking i may have overreacted , " @entity5 said			1
by 1 p.m. the next day , the emergency room doctor told @entity1 he was lucky not to have had a heart attack			1
his left main coronary artery , often called the widow maker , was 90 % blocked			0
" people will hear something and it 's like , it 's meant , " @entity35 told @entity0			2
they were meant to hear it			0
of course there were millions of other people who heard it who did n't think anything about it			0
but [ @entity5 ] needed to hear that message			1
and somehow she hung onto it			0
" patients who play an active role in their care , which can include searching symptoms online , have better health outcomes , @entity50 said			0
however , she said , it 's important to remember : the more common the symptom , the more likely it is that a misdiagnosis will occur			2
for example , something as broad as a cough could be anything from a benign cold to lung cancer			0
@entity124 occurs when people jump right to the worst - case scenario			0
" physicians can add the perspective and knowledge of putting symptoms together in terms of a patient 's history , " she said			2
alternatively , searching rarer symptoms will yield fewer possible diagnoses , she said , adding , " that can sometimes offer more help than a physician can			0
" thanks to the @entity64 , one of @entity50 's patients found that her " brain shock " was a side effect of coming off serotonin to treat anxiety and depression			2
" i was n't aware that could be a potential side effect ... and since she 's brought it to my attention , i can tell other patients , " @entity50 said			2
although @entity1 and @entity5 now readily turn to the @entity64 and tv , they know it ca n't replace a relationship with a doctor			1
but the @entity157 and the doctor can complement each other			2
still , after having three heart stents implanted in 2007 , another in 2011 and being healthy on paper , @entity1 began feeling some chest discomfort this spring			0
@entity5 turned to the @entity157 and found reassurance			1
" [ stents are ] a scary thing to look up , " @entity5 said			1
" if i find really bad news , i 'll try to find something in the middle that gives you the truth but does n't freak you out			0
i was able to pull from it that [ the discomfort ] is a normal thing that happens after you have one			0
... maybe last time the artery was in a different place			0
" sticking to legitimate websites is the safest bet , @entity50 said			0
" as a general rule , any website that ends in			0
edu is going to offer reliable information , " she said , noting a physician plays a vital role in reaching an accurate diagnosis			0
but if used correctly , the @entity64 and tv can make you a more educated and empowered patient -- and maybe even save your life .			1
