as @entity2 militants swept through northern and western @entity3 in early june in a lightning advance , president @entity0 examined his options and announced that he would be prepared to " take targeted and precise military action			1
" nearly two months later , @entity0 , albeit reluctantly , on thursday approved the use of airstrikes in @entity3			2
he said the step was taken to defend @entity11 personnel in the city of @entity13 and protect religious minorities facing what he called a " potential act of genocide " from the @entity19 , the extremist group most recently known as the @entity21 ( @entity21 )			1
the escalation marks a turning point in the @entity0 administration 's foreign policy , which has avoided direct military involvement in @entity3 and @entity27 until now			1
it 's been a cautious policy that has come under fire from @entity31 and some military and foreign policy experts			1
and while @entity0 's foreign policy ratings have plummeted , he has sought to avoid dragging a war - weary nation into another @entity38 conflict			1
' political cover ' administration officials acknowledge @entity0 was reluctant to authorize military action , but was compelled to act to protect the @entity43 stronghold of @entity13 and stave off the potential slaughter of tens of thousands of @entity45 and @entity46 , both religious minorities in @entity3			1
" when we have the unique capabilities to help avert a massacre , then i believe the @entity11 can not turn a blind eye , " @entity0 said on thursday			2
but he was still careful to emphasize the need to protect @entity11 diplomats and military advisers stationed in @entity13			1
and @entity56 spokesman @entity55 stressed on friday that the " top priority " of the military operation is " first and foremost the protection of @entity11 personnel			0
" @entity62 military analysts retired maj. gen. @entity63 and retired col. @entity64 said the presence of @entity11 personnel in @entity13 gives @entity0 the political cover to act militarily to address the precarious humanitarian situation			1
" if that humanitarian disaster was not in place , i do n't know that the president would have acted as aggressively , " said @entity63 , a @entity62 military analyst			0
but now , military commanders have a " green light " to act , @entity75 , @entity0 's deputy national security adviser said			2
@entity64 agreed that @entity0 would not have authorized airstrikes unless @entity11 personnel were stationed in @entity13 and noted that the administration 's goals are unclear			1
" i think they 're looking at this very tactically and i do n't know if they have a strategic vision here , " @entity64 said , noting that the immediate objectives are clearly to blunt @entity21 's advance toward @entity13 and help protect the @entity45 and @entity46 refugees			2
opinion : can the @entity89 live with ' brutal ' @entity90 offshoot @entity21 ? political heat that is not the first time the administration has been criticized for lacking a strategic vision for countering @entity21			0
republicans on @entity97 have repeatedly criticized @entity0 for undermining @entity11 influence globally by not acting decisively enough on @entity3 and @entity27 -- among other global crises			1
and even after @entity0 authorized airstrikes in @entity3 thursday , the most consistent critics of his policy in @entity3 and @entity27 continued to slam him			1
@entity31 sens. @entity103 of @entity104 and @entity105 of @entity106 , who have partly pinned @entity21 's advance on @entity0 's full military withdrawal from @entity3 , knocked @entity0 's " policy of half measures " and called on him to " degrade @entity21			1
" " it is inherently expansionist and must be stopped , " the pair said in a statement following the president 's announcement thursday			0
" the longer we wait to act , the worse the threat will become			0
" and @entity56 speaker @entity118 lamented the " ongoing absence of strategy " in a statement released friday			0
and in june , an animated @entity118 accused @entity0 of " taking a nap " instead of dealing with @entity21			0
republicans , like @entity124 chairman @entity123 and sen. @entity125 , criticized @entity0 last summer for not ordering military strikes in @entity27 after that country 's authoritarian regime reportedly used chemical weapons in the ongoing civil war -- which @entity0 had called a " red line " that would prompt action			1
the link with @entity27 many have also criticized @entity0 's inaction in @entity27 as contributing to @entity21 ' growth by failing to bolster the moderate rebel forces			1
without sufficient financial and military support , moderate rebel factions have dwindled as some fighters and entire groups opted to join @entity21 and other @entity2 factions fighting against government forces			0
the hands - off approach in @entity27 even prompted the @entity11 ambassador to the country , @entity147 , to resign recently because he could no longer defend the policy , he told @entity62 in june			2
" had there been more military assistance ... the opposition would have probably been able to gain ground a couple years ago more quickly , " @entity147 said			0
" ( and ) the ability of @entity90 and @entity2 extremist groups to recruit away from the moderates would have been less			0
" and aside from the destruction of @entity27 's chemical weapons arsenal , @entity147 said there is " nothing we can point to that has been very successful in our policy			2
" @entity147 and others have called @entity21 a national security threat to the @entity11 and fears are growing that its fighters could return to @entity167 or the @entity11 and carry out terrorist attacks			0
" to stand back and do nothing is to simply see this cancer metastasize further , " @entity147 said			0
map : where is @entity21 ? increasing strength but even as @entity0 's policy in @entity3 and @entity27 faces continued criticism , his reluctance to intervene militarily is in line with most of the @entity11 public 's thinking			1
in a september 2013 @entity62 poll , about six in 10 @entity11 opposed a resolution that would authorize military action in @entity27 and 55 % opposed airstrikes			2
and a recent @entity186 poll showed that only 39 % of @entity11 believed in july that the @entity11 has a responsibility to intervene in @entity3			0
meanwhile , the militant group has not only continued to increase its territorial gains , but also increased its military strength by reportedly seizing weapons , armored vehicles and even tanks from @entity3 forces -- equipment the @entity11 provided to @entity3			0
" you can pull that thread , " @entity63 said of the link to @entity11 policy in @entity27			2
" it 's positive in my mind that had we acted more aggressively in @entity27 , the problem with @entity21 would probably be less exacerbated and aggressive			0
" what to know about @entity21 will anyone stop @entity21 ? could @entity21 retaliate against the @entity89 ?			0

by authorizing strikes , @entity0 's decision marks a turning point in @entity3 foreign policy
@entity0 's reluctant action comes after @entity31 criticism of his foreign policy on @entity3 and @entity27
@entity0 said the @entity11 was acting to protect @entity11 on the ground in @entity13
but past failures , *questions* over a broader strategy loom as @entity11 asserts power in @entity3
