-- over the past two decades , bishop @entity1 has built his public ministry at @entity3 near @entity4 , @entity5 , upon a testosterone - laden theology and a hypermasculine image			1
his books bear titles such as " taking over , " " @entity10 " and " @entity11			0
" typical names for his sermons are " @entity14 " and " @entity15			0
" the ministry motto , " taking @entity21 , " is signified by a golden sword and shield that adorns the bishop 's ring finger			1
this is why i was saddened to watch @entity1 duck and dodge allegations that he seduced multiple teenage boys into sexual relationships			1
one would think that someone who constantly preaches about male headship , rulership , and power would deny these allegations with the same bravado that he defends his right to drive a $ 300,000 automobile			2
yet on sunday we never heard the term " innocent , " or a refutation of the charges			0
in fact , we witnessed a cowardly , rhetorical two - step that may mark the tragic end to this bishop 's reign			1
@entity46 quotes like " i am not the man being portrayed on television , " and " i 'm going to fight this , " are at best nondenials			0
anyone familiar with these sorts of civil cases knows that such word selection is common among those trying to deflect a potential perjury charge down the line			1
either @entity1 engaged in inappropriate sexual acts with these young men or he did n't			1
to hide behind legal counsel , biblical metaphors and spiritualized acknowledgments of one 's imperfection insults the intelligence of those who respect him and his ministry			1
the question on the hearts and minds of parishioners is not whether he is a " perfect man			0
" nor does this story have anything to do with @entity76 , as @entity1 so irresponsibly alluded			1
the faithful just want to know whether @entity1 used his authority ( and their money ) to maintain a teenage male harem under the pretense of mentoring			1
is this too much to ask ? as a professor of social ethics who trains aspiring clergy , you pray religious leaders adhere to two important points			0
first , although we all fall short of our professed moral ideals , one should never spiritualize indiscretions			0
and no religious leader is fit to be called a leader unless he or she is willing to acknowledge when he or she is wrong			0
second , we must draw a line between our position and the institution that we are called to serve			0
the latter should always be considered more precious and important than the former			0
@entity1 had four days leading up to sunday morning to address these charges			1
but aside from a brief yet legally broad statement through lawyers saying that " the charges against me and @entity107 are false , " he did not counter the boys ' allegations			2
he did choose , however , to invite the media and the world into the house of prayer on the @entity114			0
by doing so , he appears to be the kind of pastor who puts his own protection and self - preservation before the community of faith			0
and rather than courageously defending himself , he looked like a coward using @entity107 's congregation as human shields			2
if the bishop wants to take authority , he needs to begin by taking some responsibility			1
maybe for the good of @entity107 , @entity1 should take that sword out of his golden ring and fall on it			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity135 .			2

@entity137 : bishop @entity1 never directly refuted allegations of seducing teen boys
@entity135 says those trying to deflect a perjury charge use the cowardly rhetoric long used
long hid behind biblical metaphors , he *writes* , used congregation as shield
@entity135 believes if the bishop wants authority , he needs to take responsibility
