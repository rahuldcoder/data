-- interruptions in the emergency room may exact an unhealthy toll on patient care , a group of @entity3 researchers reported thursday			1
the researchers , from the @entity9 and the @entity10 , found that interruptions led emergency department doctors to spend less time on the tasks they were working on and , in nearly a fifth of cases , to give up on the task altogether			1
the researchers carried out a time - and - motion study in the emergency department of a 400 - bed teaching hospital , observing 40 doctors for more than 210 hours			1
they found that each doctor was typically interrupted 6.6 times per hour ; 11 percent of all tasks were interrupted , 3.3 percent of them more than once			2
they calculated time on task and found that physicians spent less time on interrupted tasks than on uninterrupted tasks			1
in addition , doctors were multitasking 12.8 percent of the time			2
doctors did not return to 18.5 percent of the interrupted tasks , according to the study , which was published in the journal @entity37 in @entity38			1
" it appears that in busy interrupt - driven clinical environments , clinicians reduce the time they spend on clinical tasks if they experience interruptions , and may delay or fail to return to a significant portion of interrupted tasks , " concluded the authors , who were led by @entity40 , director of the health informatics research and evaluation unit on the @entity43 at the @entity9			1
" @entity51 may occur because interrupted tasks are truncated to ' catch up ' for lost time , which may have significant implications for patient safety			2
" other studies have shown that interruptions can result in lapses of attention , memory or perception , they wrote			2
" further , interruptions add significantly to cognitive load , increase stress and anxiety , inhibit decision - making performance and increase task errors , " they said			2
the interruptions included a doctor being asked a question while trying to write a prescription			0
" now , most people think it 's very acceptable to interrupt , " but doing so can be dangerous , lead author @entity40 said			0
she urged hospital emergency department directors to teach hospital personnel when it is acceptable to interrupt and when it may be better to find an alternative strategy			1
" we really have to look at ways to try and reduce unnecessary interruptions , " she said			0
though this study did not document any negative outcomes associated with interruptions , @entity40 published a paper two weeks ago that found a direct association between interruptions and the number of medication errors made by nurses			2
" i think we have to look at interruptions as a potentially dangerous strategy in clinical work environments , " she said			0
on average , doctors completed tasks that were interrupted once in about half the time they would have taken if they had not been interrupted			1
that perplexed the authors , who speculated that the interruptions led clinicians to try to compensate for the " lost " time by working faster and cutting corners			1
they said there was a strong need to develop processes that minimize unnecessary interruptions and multitasking			0
" our results support the hypothesis that the highly interruptive nature of busy clinical environments may have a negative impact on patient safety , " they said			0
if their results are confirmed , they added , clinical work processes should be redesigned			0
other industries have recognized interruptions as dangerous , including the airline industry , which has developed strategies to reduce interruptions to the flight crew during takeoff and limited unnecessary communications with the cockpit			0
" in our society , we get very used to interrupting each other , " @entity40 said			0
" sometimes we need to stop and think about that			0
" neither the @entity133 nor the @entity134 responded immediately to requests for comment			0
the study was funded by @entity3 's @entity138 and @entity139 .			1

@entity3 study looks at 40 emergency department doctors for 210 hours
interruptions led doctors to spend less time on the tasks they were working on
in nearly a fifth of cases interruptions cause them to give up on the task altogether
