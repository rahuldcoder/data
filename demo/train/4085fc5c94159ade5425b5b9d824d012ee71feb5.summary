-- @entity2 secretary of state @entity1 and @entity4 's foreign minister expressed concern monday over @entity7 's nuclear ambitions during a meeting between the two leaders			1
at the meeting in @entity12 , @entity4 , @entity4 foreign minister @entity10 called on @entity7 " to respond to efforts to remove regional and international suspicions toward its nuclear program " and stressed his country 's desire for a region " free of weapons of mass destruction , most notably nuclear weapons			1
" @entity23 called @entity7 's recent announcement that it will start to produce higher - grade enriched uranium , " a provocative move in defiance of @entity30 resolutions " and warned that the " increasingly disturbing and destabilizing actions " by @entity7 " will result in increasing isolation			1
" @entity23 's comments came hours after she told a town hall meeting in @entity36 , @entity37 , that the @entity2 believes @entity7 " is moving toward a military dictatorship			1
" @entity23 was responding to a question about whether the @entity2 was getting ready for military action in @entity7			1
" no , we are planning to bring the world community together in applying pressure to @entity7 through sanctions adopted by the @entity30 that will be particularly aimed at those enterprises controlled by the @entity46 , which we believe is , in effect , supplanting the government of @entity7 , " @entity23 said			1
" we see that the government of @entity7 , the supreme leader , the president , the parliament , is being supplanted , and that @entity7 is moving toward a military dictatorship			2
now , that is our view			0
" the tough comments on @entity7 came during @entity23 's four - day trip to the @entity58			1
a day earlier , @entity23 called for stronger actions against @entity7 in the wake of its announcement that it is stepping up production of highly enriched uranium			1
" @entity7 leaves the international community little choice but to impose greater costs for its provocative steps , " she said			2
" together , we are encouraging @entity7 to reconsider its dangerous policy decisions			2
" speaking at the @entity2 - @entity70 , @entity23 said the @entity2 is " working actively " with its partners " to prepare and implement new measures to convince @entity7 to change its course			1
" @entity7 already faces @entity30 sanctions			1
the five permanent members of the @entity30 -- the @entity2 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 , all of which have veto power -- have been engaged along with @entity83 in discussions about possible further sanctions			2
while @entity23 was in @entity37 , adm. @entity86 , chairman of the @entity87 , arrived in @entity88 sunday evening to meet with that nation 's top military officials , including minister of defense @entity91			2
" right now , diplomatic efforts continue , " @entity86 said , according to the @entity93 web site			1
" the option to attack @entity7 is still on the table , but we 're not there yet			2
" @entity7 president @entity98 has said @entity88 " must be wiped off the map " politically			0
the @entity2 has had to assure @entity88 that its interests will be protected to keep its military on the sidelines			0
" conflict with @entity7 would be a big problem for everyone , " @entity86 said			0
" i worry about the unintended consequences of an attack			0
while every situation has limits , we 're not there yet			0
the diplomatic efforts must be exhausted until the end			1
" @entity7 said last week that it had completed its first batch of 20 percent enriched uranium and will soon triple production			0
uranium enriched to 20 percent can set off a nuclear reaction , scientists say , but is not weapons grade			0
@entity2 assistant secretary of state @entity120 told @entity0 monday that the @entity2 , @entity79 and @entity77 recently sent a joint letter to @entity124 director general @entity123 challenging @entity7 's decision to enrich uranium to 20 percent and emphasizing other options available to @entity7 so it would not need to increase enrichment			0
" we referred back to the @entity131 research reactor proposal from last fall that @entity7 has yet to accept and we alluded to the availability of medical isotopes on the international market , " @entity120 said			2
" given these two legitimate and immediately available options , there is no rationale for @entity7 to attempt to produce its own fuel			0
" asked about comments made monday by the director of @entity7 's @entity142 , @entity143 , to the semiofficial @entity144 that @entity7 would be prepared to stop its 20 percent enrichment , @entity120 encouraged @entity7 to bring its ideas to the table			0
" if they have ideas on how to enact the @entity131 research reactor proposal , they should bring them to the @entity124 and we can have another round of talks , " @entity120 said			0
" within the parameters of the @entity131 research reactor proposal , we are happy to discuss effective ways of implementing it			0
our problem is that we had one meeting on the issue and @entity7 has yet to come back to the table			0
" the @entity70 republic insists its nuclear program is solely for peaceful civilian purposes			1
" but @entity7 has consistently failed to live up to its responsibilities			0
it has refused to demonstrate to the international community that its nuclear program is entirely peaceful , " @entity23 said			1
" and last year , the world learned of a secret nuclear facility near the city of @entity167			0
" the country could get the enriched uranium that it says it wants for medical research by accepting a proposal under which @entity7 would ship its uranium abroad to be enriched and then returned , but @entity7 has rejected that offer , @entity23 said			2
" this has only deepened the international community 's doubts about @entity7 's nuclear intentions , along with the @entity7 government 's own isolation			2
" @entity7 has also refused recent diplomatic efforts to reach a resolution , she said			1
a soon - to - be released @entity2 assessment of @entity7 's nuclear program is expected to conclude the government has resumed limited work on a nuclear weapon , according to a @entity2 official			1
@entity0 's @entity189 contributed to this report .			0
