can we really say that the crisis in @entity2 is as important as meeting the challenge of @entity4 , also known as the @entity5 , or @entity6 , or the @entity7 ? an initial answer would be that our shifting attention is part of the problem , which @entity12 has consistently exploited to get what it wants			1
@entity12 maximized its deliveries of men and arms to @entity2 in august and september to coincide with one peak of the crisis in @entity19			1
appeals by the likes of former @entity12 foreign minister @entity22 that " considering the surrounding threats , we have to find a way out of the @entity30 mess as soon as possible " are unfortunately attractive to some , but are an invitation to ignore our own true interests			1
the @entity32 summit in @entity33 in september did n't seem to think @entity2 was that important			1
it produced something resembling a plan for @entity4 , and some palliatives for the next possible crisis in @entity39 by beefing up security in @entity41 and the @entity42			0
but it did little to help @entity2 now			1
@entity30 president @entity45 's speech to @entity46 in september was interrupted by applause 40 times , but his barbed remark that @entity2 " can not win a war with blankets " only produced $ 53 million in non-lethal aid			1
@entity4 is of course hugely important			0
the humanitarian crisis in @entity55 and @entity19 involves over 10 million refugees and internally displaced persons ( @entity58 )			0
the threat of jihadis returning home , especially to the likes of the @entity63 , is rightly of paramount concern			0
so is the issue of why so many left the @entity63 to fight in the first place			0
there is also a sense of responsibility for what happened after 2003 or 1991			0
but , apart from the issue of militant recruitment and terrorist blowback within @entity39 , this is not an issue about @entity39 's neighborhood			0
@entity2 , on the other hand , is both the literal and metaphorical frontier of @entity39			1
and @entity12 's entire modus operandi , of which its current actions in @entity2 are only the most visible part , is not only a challenge to the @entity83 order , but a challenge that is dangerously exploiting the many existing problems within the @entity86			1
so , here is a list of reasons to be concerned			0
@entity12 has n't finished , even in @entity2			1
the territories its proxies control in the @entity93 make no historical or economic sense			0
@entity12 also wants @entity2 to fail			1
the story that began with the @entity97 in @entity98 in february was about changing @entity2 for the better			1
then it became about @entity2 's very survival as a state			1
@entity30 voters in the october elections showed a strong desire to get back to the original story			0
but @entity12 clearly does not want that to happen			1
and if @entity2 does fail to transform itself , it will be only one in a string of dysfunctional states ringing the @entity86			1
all of @entity12 's neighbors , friend and foe , are worried			1
@entity12 has been creating an alternative media space in the @entity42 for years			2
it is blatantly interfering in @entity115 's upcoming election			0
states like @entity117 with aging leaders and @entity12 minorities worry that succession crises might be turned into secession crises			2
@entity122 has used the crisis as cover to launch a political crack - down ; saber - rattling with neighboring @entity126 almost led to war in august			0
@entity12 and @entity2 are locked together in a spiral of economic decline			1
@entity130 is forecast to fall by 10 % this year			0
@entity2 also has a humanitarian crisis ; the official estimate for @entity58 by the @entity133 was already 445,000 by 10 november			2
the @entity12 economy was already flat - lining even before the oil price started heading south			2
@entity86 states like @entity137 are finally also feeling the cost of sanctions , with unfortunate timing as the @entity141 again stagnates			0
none of the scenarios look good : if @entity144 rides out the pain and the @entity12 economy really crashes ; if the pain leads to internal crisis in @entity12 ; or if @entity86 soft - liners water down sanctions before they have their full effect			2
@entity12 will be an easy target for a rhetorical hard - line as the @entity155 gears up for the 2016 elections , as direct @entity155 business interests in @entity12 are few			2
what happens in @entity2 is also crucial for what happens beyond @entity2			1
@entity12 has been causing problems within the @entity86 for years			2
projects like @entity162 are more important for the corruption they channel into @entity39 than the energy they might deliver			0
@entity12 is actually keen on @entity166 joining the @entity86 , in order to have another client state on the inside			2
@entity12 did not create anti-eu parties of the left and right , or nationalist movements against @entity86 nation - states , or the post-modern cynicism common among @entity83 youth			2
but its propaganda channels and internet trolls " nudge " them all			0
@entity179 's motto is " question more " -- not believe everything we say about @entity12			1
its modus operandi is to spread doubt , cynicism and conspiracy - theory in the @entity187			0
specific propaganda messages about @entity12 or @entity2 are then buried in the post-modern melange			1
and there is a very difficult winter ahead			0
if sanctions stay at the current level , @entity12 will really feel the pain in six months			0
but @entity2 has to get there first , with the risk of further crises and renewed conflict very real .			0
