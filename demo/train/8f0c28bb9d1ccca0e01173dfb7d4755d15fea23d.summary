-- proposed new legislation wo n't change @entity4 's general ban on abortion , prime minister @entity1 said wednesday , but is about " saving lives " when pregnant women are in danger			1
@entity4 's government published the controversial draft measure late tuesday to clarify what happens when there 's a threat to the mother 's life , including a risk of suicide			1
the government wants the legislation , the @entity20 , to become law before the summer recess at the end of july			0
the draft bill is already prompting a divided response in @entity4 , with much concern focused on the provision for pregnant women who are suicidal			1
@entity1 , @entity4 's @entity28 , or prime minister , acknowledged in a speech how contentious the proposal may be in the majority @entity33 country			1
" this is an issue that has been very divisive and contentious for over 30 years , " he said			0
" it 's also an issue that is complex and sensitive , about which many @entity4 people have sincere and strongly held views			0
" we are a compassionate people			0
this is about women , it is about saving lives -- the life of the mother and the life of the unborn			1
" the government 's aim , @entity1 said , " is to protect the lives of women and their unborn babies by clarifying the circumstances in which doctors can intervene where a woman 's life is at risk			1
" at the same time , he said , the bill " restates the general prohibition on abortion in @entity4			0
" the draft bill seeks to bring the country 's legislation into line with a @entity70 judgment two decades ago that it is legal to end a pregnancy when there is a risk to the life of the mother			1
@entity4 has also had to look again at its abortion legislation because of its obligations under @entity80 human rights law			0
legal framework presentation of the draft law follows calls for change from some quarters after the death last october in @entity88 of an @entity90 - born dentist who was denied an abortion while miscarrying			0
the coroner at an inquest into the death of @entity95 last month recommended that authorities lay out exactly when doctors can intervene to save the life of a mother			0
woman 's death in @entity4 abortion case ruled ' medical misadventure ' the government says its proposed bill sets out a " clear legal framework " for women and medical practitioners in @entity4			1
under the draft legislation , when the threat is not from suicide , two doctors must jointly certify that there is a " real and substantial risk " of the loss of the pregnant woman 's life , and that they believe abortion is the only way to avert that risk			1
one of the doctors must be an obstetrician or gynecologist , and at least one of the two should consult with the woman 's own doctor where possible			1
when the risk to the pregnant woman 's life is from suicide , the assessment must be made by an obstetrician or gynecologist , along with two psychiatrists			1
husband testifies his wife died after abortion was denied in @entity4 a doctor is also allowed to terminate a pregnancy in the case of a medical emergency if there is an immediate threat to the pregnant woman 's life , the draft states			1
the procedure must be carried out by a registered medical practitioner at an appropriate location			0
the final decision on whether to carry out the abortion will always be made by the pregnant woman , it adds			1
' empty and misleading ' while anti-abortion campaigners say the proposed legislation would make abortion too easy , pro-choice proponents say it will still be too difficult for women to access the procedure			2
@entity161 lawmaker @entity160 told the @entity4 parliament wednesday that the bill would not stop the " exportation of abortion " -- referring to the @entity4 women who travel to @entity165 for terminations to circumvent the ban			2
addressing the prime minister , @entity160 said : " i 'm glad this legislation is before us , but let 's be clear what you 've presented is the absolute minimum			0
the clear intention is to make it so restrictive that most women who will be affected will not even bother , that instead they will continue to make the journey to @entity165 so that you can continue to pretend that there 's no @entity4 abortion			2
" meanwhile , the @entity183 dismissed the government 's reassurances over the general abortion ban as " empty and misleading , " and said claims the new legislation would be life - saving are dishonest			1
" what matters is what 's contained in the bill , and what 's in the bill is dangerous , " said @entity190 , a legal consultant to the campaign			2
" for the first time an @entity4 government is proposing to introduce a law that provides for the direct intentional targeting of the life of the unborn child			2
" the draft legislation will be discussed by the @entity4 parliament 's health committee over the coming weeks before being presented to both houses of parliament			2
it is almost certain to be approved in the end , as the coalition government has a big majority			0
some lawmakers from the main coalition party @entity213 are likely to vote against the bill , however			0
their opposition is set to be expressed at their weekly party meeting wednesday evening			0
anti-abortion protesters may also gather wednesday			0
@entity4 's deputy prime minister , or tanaiste , @entity219 , reminded lawmakers wednesday that a small number of pregnant women do find themselves in the awful situation where their life is in danger			2
" women have a right to know that if the worst happens , they will be able to have life - saving treatment , " he said			2
" yesterday , the government made a decision that that right will now be vindicated			0
