-- pop star @entity1 was arrested thursday and was charged with drunken driving , resisting arrest and driving without a valid license after police spotted him street racing early thursday morning			1
here 's what we know about elements of the case : 1			0
@entity1 " made some statements that he had consumed some alcohol , and that he had been smoking marijuana and consumed some prescription medication , " said @entity12 police chief @entity11			1
how did @entity1 , who 's just 19 , get the alcohol , marijuana and pills ? an excellent question , and one that has no certain answer			1
@entity1 may be 19 but he had " an entourage of about 15 people , " says @entity0 's @entity26			1
in @entity12 that included @entity1 's father , @entity27 , 38			1
given money , fame and willing pals , @entity1 conceivably had access to whatever he desired			1
@entity1 arrested on drunken driving , resisting arrest charges 2			1
@entity1 was driving a yellow @entity35			1
again , given his age , how did he rent it ? @entity38 , the exotic - auto rental establishment from which @entity1 rented the @entity35 , posted a blog entry and a series of pictures about the return of the vehicle and another on thursday			1
" for everyone that was concerned with the news , the cars are back safe and sound ! believe half of what you see and none of what you hear , " the firm wrote			0
according to @entity38 's rental policy , " @entity57 requires driver to be 25 years of age and older to rent a vehicle			0
in certain cases , we may be able to rent to drivers between the ages of 21 - 25			0
" the @entity35 rent for between $ 600 and $ 1,800 a day , and require a deposit of between $ 5,000 and $ 12,000			0
the person who made the rental for @entity1 has n't been revealed			2
@entity69 , the coo of @entity70 , which has a @entity12 location , says his company requires both a valid driver 's license and valid insurance and will not rent to people under 21			0
@entity76 also runs a license check to make sure there are n't any surprises in the driver 's background , @entity69 says			0
however , he observed , those policies are n't uniform in the rental - car world			0
the @entity85 's @entity84 told @entity86 that the onus is on the rental company , not the renter			2
" the law varies by state but technically anyone under 21 should n't be driving even if someone of age signs for the car , " he said			0
" it would be the burden of the rental company to prosecute that , though ; as long as the car is n't stolen the cops would n't care			0
@entity1 is a @entity101 citizen			1
could this arrest lead to his deportation ? it 's too early to say			2
first of all , @entity1 has not been convicted of a crime			2
second , the charges thus far are misdemeanors			0
the state attorney 's office told @entity0 that it could take several weeks to determine what type of charges may be added -- if there are charges added at all			2
@entity114 immigration law says people can be deported if they 're convicted of what 's called an " aggravated felony " or a " crime of moral turpitude			1
" @entity121 's @entity120 , a former prosecutor , points out , " @entity122 is not an aggravated felony			0
however , ' aggravated @entity122 ' can be considered a crime of moral turpitude			0
an aggravated dui in @entity126 is generally charged for repeat offenders or in cases where an accident has occurred resulting in serious injury or death			0
" however , @entity120 says he believes @entity1 would not likely face deportation as a result of these charges			2
could the police file more charges in the @entity1 case ? maybe			1
the state attorney 's office told @entity0 it is looking at a variety of sources , including social media accounts , and will decide if other charges are warranted , including contributing to the delinquency of a minor or street racing			2
@entity1 and his cohort , @entity147 singer @entity146 , were doing up to 60 mph in a 30 mph zone , according to the police report			1
was @entity1 given preferential treatment ? there are n't any reports of the @entity153 treating @entity1 any differently than other people they 've arrested			2
however , three officers in nearby @entity157 have been suspended in connection with allegations that they escorted @entity1 's caravan in the @entity12 area without authorization this week			1
@entity0 's @entity26 and @entity163 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 's arrest thursday raises several questions
@entity1 , 19 , told police he had been *drinking* , smoking pot
@entity1 is a @entity101 citizen ; could arrest hurt his @entity114 status ?
