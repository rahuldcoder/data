-- in many ways -- more than just distance , at least -- it is a long way from the remote city of @entity6 in the restive northwest @entity8 province of @entity9 to @entity10 , the bustling , teeming capital of @entity11			2
but it was a journey that an uyghur artist named @entity14 made earlier this month			1
it was his first trip outside @entity8			2
father to a young daughter , @entity14 -- whose name is sometimes spelled @entity18 -- was part of a delegation of some 24 artists who were returning to @entity8 from the " @entity22 : @entity25 and @entity26 " art exhibition , held march 4 to 6 in the @entity11 city			1
the exhibition also acted as a cultural exchange conference , while celebrating the 40th anniversary of diplomatic ties between @entity8 and @entity11			0
@entity14 , who won an award for his work during the exchange , and his colleagues were on board @entity35 when it disappeared somewhere over the @entity38 early in the morning of march 8			1
a talented , popular painter , who uses oils as his medium , @entity14 teaches painting at a @entity6 middle school , a position that perhaps belies his talents			1
a painting of his , entitled " outlook " is part of @entity49 of @entity8 collection , a testament to the 35 - year old 's skill			1
a colleague from his school , @entity53 , said " @entity14 has ( a ) good personality			1
he cares for students , his ideas are progressive and he 's dedicated to his job			1
" a hard worker prior to taking the position in @entity6 , @entity14 studied in @entity61 for a year at the @entity62			1
@entity63 , who befriended the young @entity65 painter in 1999 on a trip to @entity6 , suggested he attend a one - year program at the academy			1
" he tried really hard			0
he had to live on instant noodles every day because there was no @entity72 food			0
but still he worked really hard and kept on painting			0
so from what i know of him , he 's very hardworking and has great pursuits in art. " @entity63 recalls the moment that he realized that his friend and student was on the flight			1
" i stopped what i was doing			0
and all of a sudden i felt so weak			0
because he was my good friend and he was always supporting me			2
of course , my legs went weak and i had no strength			0
i thought , how was it that i was able to meet with him			0
" some extremists from a sizable @entity72 population in @entity9 have fostered unrest in the province and beyond , which boiled over at the beginning of march with a massacre at a @entity95 train station			0
@entity96 recalls that , following @entity35 's disappearance , he was asked to clarify his friend 's " situation " with the police			1
when news of the flight 's disappearance broke over two weeks ago , @entity8 media initially blurred @entity14 's name from the passenger manifest , fearing that a @entity108 attack was to blame for the flight 's disappearance			1
the @entity8 government has since ruled that none of its citizens that were aboard @entity35 have any link to terrorism			1
@entity63 adamantly believes his friend has no link to terrorist activities , and could not have been involved in the disappearance of @entity35			1
" no , absolutely not a possibility			0
i know him well , and there 's no way ... he is someone who perseveres in art. he would not use lives to do this to art. no way ... it 's not ' probably he did not do it			2
' it 's ' absolutely no way he could have done it			2
' " @entity133 , 32 , a cameraman with @entity135 's documentary channel met the painter at a local gallery in @entity6 in 2005 while he was filming ethnic group cultural elements , and was drawn to his passion			1
" i found his paintings interesting , " says @entity133 , " he 's the kind of person that lives for his art. painting is his life			1
his biggest wish is to express his feelings with painting , especially his feelings for his hometown			0
" he 's been a really modest person when he was with me and my other friends			1
he always seeks advice for his painting from others , like advice on the use of color and other things			0
" the @entity9 passenger it was on march 2 that @entity14 flew to @entity11			1
@entity133 spoke briefly with his friend the day before , but news of the @entity95 knife attack soured his mood and prevented him from accompanying him to the airport			1
he heard again from his friend a couple of days later , with the news that he 'd been interviewed by local media , and again the following day when he posted on @entity172 that he 'd won the award			2
" i sent a message to him : ' congratulations brother			0
we should celebrate when you come back			0
' " @entity133 learned the news right after it came out on march 8			2
" it was when the news came out the @entity9 passenger was with the 24 people artist group that i immediately realized it was him			2
" then i just ... i just could n't believe it happened to him			0
i still believe , until today , that he 's coming back , and i will film his stories			2
" he called @entity14 's wife on the second day of the plane 's disappearance			1
" they arrived on the third day because the weather conditions did n't allow them to fly to @entity61 on day two			0
i picked them up from the airport when his family arrived			0
his wife was ( emotional ) when she saw me			0
" in the past few days , @entity133 has been telling @entity14 's story to media			1
" at this very moment , many people need to know about what kind of man he is			0
that 's what i 've been working on			2
" " his daughter is too young to understand what happened			0
she believes her father went to @entity11 and is on his way back , but she does n't know when he 'll return			0
" @entity0 " s @entity212 and @entity213 contributed to this report			0
