@entity0 -- for a few hours before @entity3 's announcement that it would grant the @entity5 founder political asylum , and for 12 hours after the announcement , # @entity6 trended on @entity8 across @entity6 's homeland , @entity10			1
it was as though the void left by the @entity13 was filled by the oddly mesmerizing spectacle of a widely anticipated decision , well ahead of the @entity3 foreign ministers ' blistering critique of @entity18 , the @entity19 and @entity20 and the parlous situation in which the white - haired @entity6 finds himself			1
as @entity6 's supporters rallied in @entity24 outside the @entity3 embassy where he has been holed up for 58 days , in @entity10 the political elite seemed to be scurrying to the safety of black letter law			1
opinion : @entity10 to @entity6 's rescue ? do n't hold your breath prime minister @entity32 has made no comment in the wake of @entity3 's decision and it 's unlikely she will , formally			1
in the political typhoon of the 24 - hour news cycle she will no doubt be asked for her reaction to @entity3 's clear belief that it is offering @entity6 support denied him by his own government			1
her response is expected to echo the pr - filtered offering of her usually loquacious -- but suddenly media shy -- foreign minister senator @entity48			2
his spokesperson told @entity1 that having watched events unfold through the night , the @entity6 drama has " elements of fascination , in particular the strong statements on the @entity19			0
" @entity10 , he said , contemplated responding to the statements made by @entity3			2
instead it has decided to watch and wait because " nothing has changed			0
" nor is it likely that the impasse might soon resolve , offered the spokesperson			0
in the meantime , the @entity5 founder " remains an @entity10 citizen who will receive consular support			1
" read more : standoff at embassy after @entity3 grants @entity6 asylum @entity10 appears to be narrowly interpreting the @entity3 foreign minister 's statement that " ... mr @entity6 is without the due protection and help that he should receive from any state of which he is a citizen , " as an assertion that consular assistance has been denied			1
" he has received 62 instances of consular contact in the last 18 months -- more than any other @entity10 in comparable circumstances , " the spokesman said			1
" we do n't expect him to be thanking us , but to suggest he did n't receive it is wrong			0
" but we wo n't engage in a yelling match			0
we remain where we are , " he added			0
and that is , firmly behind @entity18 's attempt to extradite @entity6 to @entity20 to face questioning over alleged sexual assault and rape and alongside its friend in good and bad times , the @entity19 , of which few questions have apparently been asked about its purported intention to prosecute @entity6 over the @entity5 release of confidential @entity19 diplomatic cables			2
opinion : @entity6 's stubborn grip hurts @entity5 if @entity3 is persuaded that the @entity19 poses a threat to @entity6 's liberty and life , some @entity10 are persuaded that if the @entity99 government decides on the drastic option of storming the @entity3 embassy , it can only be because @entity19 tells them to			1
@entity102 , a leading human rights barrister took , to twitter to ask : " @entity104 also collaborate with @entity19 attempts to get @entity6 ? " but @entity10 's opposition , usually and expectedly enthusiastic when offered the chance to attack the government , is not taking the bait			2
@entity110 leader @entity109 offered yet more black letter law : " whatever the ordinary law of @entity18 is , whatever would happen to anyone else in the same circumstances , @entity6 should get identical treatment to anyone else in a similar position , " @entity109 told the @entity118			0
the only political solace @entity6 has received is from @entity120			0
but however powerful they are in @entity10 's hung @entity122 , what they have to say on the standoff counts for little as the @entity32 government works furiously to distance itself from claims that for helping to deliver it government , the @entity120 call the shots			2
still , the comments of greens senator @entity131 are a reflection of what many @entity10 believe			0
" i 've been banging my head against this wall for the last eight months now trying to get a succession of foreign ministers to take even a faint spark of interest in what 's really happening here , " senator @entity131 told the @entity10 @entity134			0
" what the @entity3 government has done here , in effect , is offer @entity6 the protection the @entity10 government has failed to do			1
" " it 's time to pick up the phone " was his advice to the @entity10 foreign minister , issued during a press briefing			1
if @entity8 is the barometer of what @entity10 are feeling , many @entity10 agree with the senator			2
but @entity6 has one perilous pr obstacle to overcome in the days ahead			0
" my goodness , @entity6 is like a digital @entity160 , " tweeted one well - known @entity10 comedian			2
@entity6 's decision to make a public statement at the doors of his @entity24 digs on sunday , according to the @entity5 official @entity8 feed , might trigger the disdain that historically comes with rising above the parapet in such a small nation			1
in greater numbers , @entity10 might find themselves in agreement with soon - to - be former @entity99 mp @entity171 who tweeted : " he has incontrovertibly committed a criminal act here by violating his bail			0
and should be tried for it			0

@entity10 prime minister @entity32 yet to comment on @entity5 asylum decision
in its decision , @entity3 cited a lack of support for @entity6 from his home country
spokesman for @entity10 foreign minister says @entity6 has received consular assistance
on @entity8 , many @entity10 are siding with @entity6 and calls for @entity10 to do more to help him
