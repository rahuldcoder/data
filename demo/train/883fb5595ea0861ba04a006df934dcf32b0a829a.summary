@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 declared he has reached the " @entity8 " as @entity4 rolls into the @entity5 of @entity0 for sunday 's @entity7 @entity6			1
with three races left to run this season , the 33 - year - old @entity10 driver has still not announced which team he will race for in 2015			1
it is widely expected @entity3 -- a two - time world champion with @entity15 in 2005 and 2006 -- will leave @entity10 and be replaced by four - time @entity17 champion @entity16			1
when asked by @entity2 in @entity1 if he felt he had reached the end of the road when it came to choosing a team capable of powering him to a coveted third world title , he responded : " probably yes			1
" winning or not winning is a matter of being in the right place , at the right moment			2
" definitely i want to win			0
i want to win the third title			0
i 'm sure that i will have the opportunity in the next years			0
" @entity3 is widely regarded as the most talented all - round driver among the current generation of racers			1
as such , the @entity31 is understood to hold the key to the major moves in @entity4 's driver @entity32			1
video : race around the awesome @entity1 circuit @entity16 was asked at the @entity38 why he has not revealed his plans despite announcing at the @entity40 @entity6 three weeks ago that he is leaving @entity17 at the end of the year			1
" what 's the delay ? because i 'm not allowed yet , " he explained			0
" i think once it 's out you can make it out for yourself			0
" @entity3 remains coolly enigmatic about where his future lies and the feisty driver is probably enjoying teasing the media pack eager for answers			1
" at the end of the day , it 's my decision , what i want and what i need to do for my future , " he said			2
" i will try to do the best for me and for @entity10 as well , as i always did , i understand everyone but i need to choose			1
you want to know the taste before cooking the plate			0
" @entity3 has been linked with a return to @entity65 , where he endured a tumultuous 2007 season as then debutant @entity68 's teammate			1
he left in acrimonious circumstances after falling out over his status within the team			2
@entity65 is entering a new phase next season with the return of its former engine partner @entity76			0
but a return to @entity65 could be doubly risky for @entity3 as the @entity76 engines are as yet unproven			2
a potential move to @entity65 has cast uncertainty over the future of the team 's current drivers @entity84 , the 2009 world champion for @entity86 , and @entity88 rookie @entity87			2
" i try not to think too much about it , at least in a negative way , " said @entity87 , who finished third on his grand prix debut in @entity90			0
" i still have a chance of being here next year so that 's what i 'm focused on			0
i can only do my best to really show that i can give them something positive for the future			0
" you really need to deliver when you 're a @entity65 driver			0
i 've got to do that			0
" i think i 've done a decent job this year , i know my potential and i know i can do a lot better			0
" i do n't have a @entity103 i 'm fully focused on @entity104 " when @entity3 signed for @entity10 in 2010 , it looked like a match made in motor racing heaven			1
but although he narrowly lost the title to @entity16 in 2010 and 2012 , the famous @entity109 team has struggled to provide a car capable of consistently challenging for the title			1
@entity3 is understood to feel it is time to move on although he said a reported sabbatical from the sport was " unlikely			2
" the @entity31 is , at least , sanguine about the lessons he learned with @entity10 , with which he has won 11 grands prix			1
" getting the respect of everyone has more value sometimes , " he told @entity2			0
" like these five years at @entity10			2
" when i joined in september 2009 i did n't have the respect that i have now , in five years it was difficult but i grew up as a driver and a person			0
" @entity3 may be older and wiser but @entity4 's gunslinger is still calling the shots in the driver market .			1

@entity3 is widely expected to leave @entity10 at the end of the season
