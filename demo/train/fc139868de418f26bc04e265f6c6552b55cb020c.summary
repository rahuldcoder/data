-- @entity2 's onfield successes this year have led to the @entity5 soccer champions ' first financial profit during the nine - year reign of owner @entity7			1
the @entity9 billionaire has bankrolled the @entity11 club since buying it for a nominal fee in 2003 , posting big losses every year since then as he has sanctioned spending sprees to sign some of the sport 's biggest players			1
last year ended in a loss of £ 67.7 million ( $ 108 million ) but the figures up to june 30 , 2012 reveal a profit of £ 1.4 million ( $ 2.2 million )			1
@entity2 also announced on friday that it had made a record turnover of £ 255.7 million ( $ 407 million ) -- which it said is the fifth largest of any @entity5 club			1
that was a boost of £ 33 million ( $ 52 million ) from last year , driven by the club 's first @entity24 title and a profit on player sales of £ 28.8 million ( $ 46 million )			1
the latter figure came despite offloading players such as @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 on free transfers while spending big on @entity34 and @entity35 in that period			0
in comparison , @entity11 rival @entity37 -- which has a more prudent transfer policy -- made a profit of £ 30.6 million ( $ 48 million ) on turnover of £ 243 million ( $ 386 million ) in figures released in september			2
another key element in @entity2 's finances is that £ 166.6 million ( $ 265 million ) of intergroup debt was capitalized into equity -- effectively personal loans to the club written off by @entity7 -- to leave the club debt free			1
@entity2 is one of the clubs under the financial spotlight following the implementation of @entity24 's new financial fairplay rules , which require teams to be self sufficient and limit the amount that benefactors such as @entity7 can spend with no expectation of return			1
if they do n't meet these targets , which are being phased in over a number of years , then clubs face expulsion from top @entity5 competitions			2
" the big challenge is always to have a successful team on the field that wins trophies and to make a profit at the same time , " said @entity2 chief executive @entity66			1
" the objectives have been set across the whole business , from the @entity74 to under - 21s and all the way through to the first team			0
" our club philosophy is built on success			0
we had that success on the field this year , as we were the first @entity83 team to win the @entity24 , and we enjoyed it off the field as well and this helps us inject financial investment into the team			0
" @entity2 has also sought to boost its income streams , signing a three - year global energy deal with @entity9 corporation @entity90 in july while also taking full control of its digital media operations			2
" we 're in favor of @entity98 , " manager @entity93 told reporters on friday ahead of this weekend 's home clash with @entity96			0
" we 're doing everything in our power to comply with the new rules , and this is great news for the club			2
" for the first time , we 've been able to achieve a profit -- also thanks to the success on field , but off field as well , with new sponsor deals and also the transfer market			2
" going forward , i think that puts @entity2 in a strong position to remain competitive at domestic level but also international level			0
" it has been a mixed season so far for @entity2 , with impressive onfield performances marred by racism controversies			0
captain @entity117 has just completed a four - match ban for abusing a black opponent a year ago , while the club has lodged a complaint against @entity11 referee @entity122 over alleged racist remarks made to @entity125 midfielder @entity124			0
a @entity2 fan has also been arrested for making an alleged monkey gesture towards a @entity129 player during last week 's @entity131 match at @entity132 .			0

@entity2 announces profit of $ 2.2 million for the period ending june 30 , 2012
it is the first time the @entity139 club has been in black since @entity7 took over
@entity9 has bankrolled @entity2 in recent years but new rules *threaten* to curb this
club says it now has the fifth largest turnover of any team in @entity5
