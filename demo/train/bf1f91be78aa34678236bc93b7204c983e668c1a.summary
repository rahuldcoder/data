the aid , she told @entity65 , would be distributed in areas where there has been little or no looting			1
@entity0 is less than 10 miles inland from @entity15 , but the two towns suffered far different fates			1
in @entity0 , the fatalities and injuries were largely the result of buildings that collapsed			1

in the central city of @entity103 , an ancient municipality , the earthquake wiped out many of the older adobe structures , crushing hundreds of residents			0
in the coastal city of @entity109 , a large wave caused most of the deaths ; officials said half of the city was damaged			0

nothing , " said @entity119 , one of 6,000 residents of the coastal hamlet of @entity122			0
" they are only concerned about the big cities , " @entity119 told @entity65			0
@entity126 , too , remained a concern			2
the mayors of @entity0 , @entity129 and @entity15 had urgently requested military help , and @entity11 said that more than 13,000 soldiers were being dispatched			1
many of those soldiers started to reach their destinations tuesday			0
but @entity136 's emergency operations manager said the situation was safe enough for the non-governmental organization to distribute aid in two villages near @entity0			1
" fortunately enough , we had the collaboration of the government and the army , " @entity141 said from @entity142			0
he credited the extension of the curfew from 6 p.m. until noon			0

@entity142 , which suffered damage from the quake but was well on its way to recovery wednesday , is about 270 miles ( 435 km ) northeast of @entity0			1
concerns about the safety of those buildings that were damaged in the quake were heightened wednesday afternoon , when a 5.6 - magnitude aftershock struck 30 miles south southwest of @entity169 , according to the @entity170			2
residents in coastal cities in @entity1 started to evacuate wednesday after officials in the fishing village of @entity175 and in the city @entity0 warned of a possible tsunami and said they had one hour to leave low - lying areas			1
the evacuations were halted minutes later when the @entity51 said there was no tsunami warning			0
since saturday 's 8.8 - magnitude earthquake , the region has suffered more than 120 aftershocks of 5.0 magnitude or greater , @entity170 geophysicist @entity183 said			2
eight of them have been 6.0 or stronger , he said			0
the aftershocks further stressed a frightened population			0
" the vast majority of the population , if not everyone at this moment , has some symptoms like anxiety , fear , depression , " said dr. @entity192 , a psychiatrist at the @entity194 's clinical hospital			2
" i would say that the next three months will be a time of fear and sadness			0
" " basically , we are all under great stress , " dr. @entity205 , a psychiatrist at the @entity194			0
" people are afraid ; they want to protect their families , and they function emotionally , not rationally			2
" the minister of public works said the country 's major highways are open and no part of the country is isolated			2
in addition , @entity214 said , air connections were being re-established , ports were being fixed , and food and fuel supplies were sufficient			0
" there is public order , " he said			0
" it was a giant earthquake , but we are handling it well			0
" but @entity1 's economy , considered by many the most competitive in @entity224 , also has taken a hit			1
about 70 percent of the nation 's economic production has been affected , particularly fruit and mining sectors , @entity65 said , citing analysts ' observations			1
but officials said wednesday that they are working to fix some sectors affected by lack of electricity and other necessities			1
for example , treasury minister @entity239 said , about 60 percent of the nation 's banks are open			1
" our economy has dealt very well with this situation , " @entity239 said			2
he and @entity11 tried to reassure @entity1 that there were sufficient supplies of food , fuel and other goods and urged residents not to hoard			1
