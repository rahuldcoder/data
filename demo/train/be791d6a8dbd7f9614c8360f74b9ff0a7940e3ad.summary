-- if you 've packed your warmest hat and coziest jacket for the @entity5 , it would be a bit disconcerting to look out your hotel window and see a palm tree , swaying in a gentle spring - like breeze			2
that , however , is exactly what many patrons of the @entity11 are experiencing			0
most people think of @entity14 in winter and picture the snow - covered cathedrals of @entity17 , where average temperatures in february range between minus 10 @entity19 ) and minus 4 @entity20 ) and all but require the wearing of those iconic fur hats			1
@entity22 , however , is one of the southernmost cities in @entity14			0
it 's located over 1,000 km south of @entity17 and has a completely different climate			0
indeed , on most winter days , @entity22 ( and the nearby town of @entity28 , where many of the events are being held ) are the warmest locations in the country			0
this was the case on monday , when @entity22 reached a balmy 15.9 @entity35 ) -- warmer than any other @entity14 city by more than 1 @entity37 compare that to the coldest location in @entity14 -- @entity41 's @entity40 , which hit -50 @entity42 )			2
the @entity43 can not say @entity22 's temperatures this month come as a surprise , as the city has the warmest climate of any @entity11 host city			1
in february , temperatures range between 3 @entity50 ) and 10 @entity51 ) on average , but as we are seeing they can climb even higher			1
these numbers mean that it edges out the previous warmest location			0
@entity61 , @entity62 , host of the @entity64 in 2010 , averages highs of about 8 @entity58 ) and lows around 1 @entity60 )			0
like @entity61 , @entity22 is a coastal town and has a much warmer climate than the surrounding areas , including the " @entity75 " venues where the skiing , snowboarding , and sliding events -- bobsled , skeleton and luge -- are taking place			0
these mountain peaks rise over 2,300 meters , and since air temperatures generally cool with height , it means these venues stay 5 - 10 c ( 41 @entity80 ) degrees cooler			1
even with this mitigating factor , the full sun and above - average temperatures this week have led to less than ideal conditions for skiing			1
ultimately , however , between the snow - making machines and the millions of pounds ( kilos ) of snow that were saved from last winter , @entity22 will avoid snowless ski and snowboard events			1
and since the events held in @entity22 and @entity28 -- the " @entity92 " -- are all indoors , they could be theoretically be held in @entity94 in july and it would n't make much of a difference -- but let 's not give the @entity43 any ideas ! but those who prefer their @entity5 to be held in places that actually feel like winter , and require the wearing of hats and jackets , can look forward to the 2018 games in @entity104 , @entity105 , where daytime highs rarely go above 0 @entity107 ) and night - time lows average -11 @entity108 ) .			2

@entity22 is the warmest @entity11 location
february average temperatures range between 3 **˚** @entity114 ) and 10 **˚** @entity115 )
however , " mountain *cluster* " venues *significantly* colder *due* to altitude
snow - making machines and last year 's snow means *slopes* will remain covered
