-- this @entity3 , like the nine that preceded it , does not come at a time of peace			1
we are no longer saying thanks to veterans of wars past such as our grandfathers , uncles or those guys who fly black pow / @entity13 flags twice a year			2
now we are thanking our children , our friends from high school and our younger cousins			0
every day , someone new is introduced to the hardships of wartime military service or the horrors of combat			1
these are wars with no clean victories			0
there are no sailors in @entity28 waiting to grab a passing dame to celebrate victory with a kiss			2
in the way that people offer their thanks , there is an echo of guilt -- just an echo -- of our country 's mistreatment of its @entity42 veterans , and that only a select few have borne this generation 's burden of war			1
that awkwardness with which the thanks is delivered , coupled with some veterans ' anxieties about what they have seen or done , can make @entity3 seem like a show of empty patriotism -- or worse , a slim bandage slapped over a gaping wound of indifference , pity or guilt			1
our towns and cities throw parades on this day , often out of tradition and in an attempt to demonstrate anything but apathy toward their war fighters			2
unlike parades past -- parades not held during wartime -- these gatherings do not celebrate victory			2
they directly celebrate service while indirectly celebrating survival			1
even that is a messy , ongoing process			0
a returning veteran stepping off a plane onto @entity78 soil is not evidence that the veteran survived the war -- about 20 % of all suicides in the @entity78 are committed by veterans			1
for some returnees , simply making it through another day is their new objective			0
life back home can seem remote , confusing or even pointless			0
now there is some discussion of restructuring the military pension system and raising the cost of health insurance for future service members to cut costs			1
that our country needs to get its fiscal house in order is not in question ; what should be examined is the tendency of our government to view military service as something comparable to private - sector work			1
this perspective , when combined with a cynical political understanding that the military will accept any burden , puts additional strain upon our overtaxed fighting force			2
consider how our civilian population 's experiences on this @entity3 will contrast sharply with that of the military : in the @entity78 , a man will wake up , make breakfast , pack his briefcase and walk to his car worrying about traffic jams			1
in @entity123 , an infantryman will wake up , slug down the same food he has been eating for months , check his equipment and climb into his armored vehicle worrying about the road disintegrating beneath him			0
in the @entity78 , a hardworking mother of three will cycle her children through the shower , make breakfast and send them off to school before she heads to work			1
in @entity137 , a hardworking military police platoon leader will cycle her 20 soldiers through personal hygiene and the chow hall , and lead the convoy briefing before they go on patrol			2
in the @entity78 , a man will work a part - time job in a warehouse , running a forklift and hauling merchandise throughout the night , impatient to reach home			1
at @entity150 , a soldier waiting for his leave flight back to the @entity78 will draw extra duty			1
his detail will move dead bodies -- dozens of them -- throughout the night , storing them carefully inside of a transport plane			0
he will be impatient to be done with the solemn yet gruesome task , but when he is finished , he will have to be ordered to take leave			0
with the images of the dead fresh in his mind , he will be disoriented and not even want to go home anymore			0
he wo n't be sure where to go , for that matter			0
in the @entity78 , politicians propose cutting military pensions and health benefits			1
overseas , veterans see the potential reduction of military benefits and conclude that their service and their sacrifices -- over many years and multiple deployments -- are not a priority to the very politicians ( of both major parties ) that sent them to war			1
like the casualty numbers in @entity123 , the number of combat veterans keeps rising			0
let this @entity3 -- like the decade of @entity183 before it -- be an opportunity to hear the stories of our warriors , to ask them honest and respectful questions without fearing them or projecting preconceived notions onto them			1
let it be a day where we can see the falsehood in the argument that government cuts should start with those who have already given up so much			0
let this holiday be spent celebrating the freedom to live our lives safely and without fear of terrorism or enemy attack			0
so go to work , send your kids to school , say goodbye for the day to loved ones -- while others ruck up for another mission			0
and remember : while the wars will not last forever , many are still in the fight and could use more than a few words of thanks when they come home			0
and over here , some are still , in their minds and in their wounds , over there			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			2

@entity224 : @entity3 more about survival than victory for many of today 's troops
he says returning troops face long *recovery* even as *budget* woes raise threat of benefit cuts
he says military service is much more taxing and *traumatic* than a civilian 's work
@entity224 : @entity78 should remember veterans ' sacrifices after decade of war
