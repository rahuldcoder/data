-- is this @entity3 's " @entity2 moment ? " when @entity6 's agent announced his client was unhappy because the @entity10 champion 's bosses failed to wish him happy birthday , social media went into meltdown			1
the 31 - year - old , who earns a reported $ 370,000 a week , has been ridiculed after his agent revealed @entity6 was left upset by the lack of congratulations afforded to him			1
according to the player 's agent , @entity6 was barely acknowledged by the club 's owners when the squad arrived in the @entity23 last week to celebrate their @entity10 title triumph			1
" none of them shook his hand on his birthday			2
it 's really sick , " his agent @entity29 told the @entity30			1
but according to one pr expert , it 's a case of a @entity10 player wanting to have his cake and eat it ; a case of professional footballers losing all touch with reality			1
" i think it 's a classic way of player trying to take control of club , " @entity40 , whose clients have included @entity3 , told @entity0			1
" he wants to be king of dressing room and fawned over			0
" this is where it often goes wrong			0
it 's the same as what happened with @entity2 at @entity53			2
" in a few months , he was gone			0
the same happened with @entity55			0
" @entity56 has dealt similarly with other players			0
when a player sees himself as bigger than the club , then it 's time to part company			1
" it 's unlikely @entity6 's behavior would have been tolerated at @entity53 under former manager @entity64			1
the @entity65 ruled @entity66 with an iron fist and anyone who dared to challenge his authority was promptly shown the door			0
in his autobiography , @entity64 describes how @entity2 , a global brand , had to leave after a heated exchange following a defeat by @entity76 in 2003			2
@entity2 suffered a cut to his head after @entity64 kicked a boot at him following a dressing - room argument -- a moment which signaled the end of their relationship			2
" the minute a @entity53 player thought he was bigger than the manager he had to go , " @entity64 wrote in his book			0
" @entity2 thought he was bigger than @entity64			0
it does n't matter whether it 's @entity64 or @entity89 the @entity90			2
the authority is what counts			0
" while @entity2 's brand was scarcely tarnished , @entity6 -- who signed a new four - year contract with @entity3 just 11 months ago -- could find himself in a far more problematic situation			1
his agent said the midfielder could leave @entity3 if he is not showed enough " respect " -- and the @entity100 star tweeted that he would make an announcement after the upcoming @entity102 in @entity103			1
" @entity3 is not respecting the player -- how can he be motivated to play for that team ? " @entity29 told @entity106			1
" if they do n't want @entity6 then he can leave at any moment			1
many clubs would be interested in him			0
" according to @entity40 , the player 's latest outburst is a sign that " the tail is trying to wag the dog			1
" " it 's going to be very difficult for @entity6 at @entity3 now , " added @entity40			1
" when you do something like this then people start using it against you in different circumstances			0
" next time , when he fails to play because he 's got a minor injury , people will start to doubt his commitment again and say , ' oh , that 's @entity6			1
' " if he did have a problem then he should have dealt with it quietly			0
he now looks a bit sad			0
" @entity6 is not the first player to find himself embarrassed by his alleged excessive demands			2
@entity40 cites an example of one player who , having lost money on his property empire , demanded his club pay up the shortfall			1
another , who had accrued large gambling debts , urged his club to pay off his creditors because it was having a negative impact on his performances			2
it 's that type of high maintenance which has helped give footballers a bad name , according to @entity40			1
" players need to understand that they are major brands , " he added			0
" i ca n't believe they do n't employ specialist employers and just rely on their agent or friend			0
they need to understand they 're working in the corporate world and not in @entity159			0
" effectively , @entity6 has devalued himself already			2
potential suitors will think they can acquire him on the cheap and it may do damage to his signing - on fee			0
" no cake -- but plenty of food for thought .			0
