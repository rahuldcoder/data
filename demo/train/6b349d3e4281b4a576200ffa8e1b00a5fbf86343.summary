-- @entity1 will not cede control of the @entity3 any time soon			1
western saber - rattling would prove hollow : @entity5 has insufficient forces in the region to challenge @entity1 control and economic sanctions are not likely to work			2
paranoia about @entity12 threats to its security incline @entity1 to endure great costs to assert the " sphere of privileged interest " @entity18 claims regarding former @entity19 now outside the @entity1			0
near term , @entity1 holds the cards			0
it supplies @entity23 with about 30 % of its natural gas , or 8 % of its energy overall			1
while that gas can be replaced , @entity23 ca n't change course overnight			1
@entity23 has substantial shale deposits that @entity31 , @entity32 and several others have chosen not to develop			2
exploiting shale deposits , building more nuclear plants and solar facilities , importing more oil and gas from @entity38 and the @entity39 , and building infrastructure to effectively deploy those resources would take several years			0
longer term , @entity1 has much more to lose			0
since the end of the @entity44 , @entity1 has become acutely dependent on @entity12 markets to drive its economy , but it has not fundamentally modernized its industries or its geopolitical thinking about the @entity50			2
oil and gas account for roughly 70 % of @entity1 exports , and it sends the @entity50 significant amounts of aluminum and other metals			1
but @entity1 's manufacturing sector as a whole remains profoundly inefficient and uncompetitive , and the country relies on the @entity50 for sophisticated financial services and a broad range of technology and consumer products			1
crony capitalism and the dominance of billionaire oligarchs squeeze out small entrepreneurs that drive so much innovation and progress in the @entity50			0
the @entity1 depends on the petroleum industry for 50 % of its revenue			0
if @entity23 finds substitutes for its oil and gas , @entity1 simply would not be able to pay for the @entity12 products it has become accustomed to buying			1
@entity76 wo n't be able to finance its military and foreign adventures , or pay for the extensive patronage system that has kept @entity18 in power since 1999			2
the oligarchs would be a lot poorer and much less able to enjoy penthouses in @entity83 and ski retreats in @entity85			0
however , most @entity1 would rather risk becoming much poorer than relent to @entity87 and @entity23 pressures , because of their ingrained fears about @entity12 threats to their security			2
with or without @entity18 at the helm , the @entity50 should not anchor policy on false notions it can change @entity76 's thinking about the @entity95 or other former @entity19 states by reasoning with its leaders or with threats to freeze assets , cut off trade and the like			0
unless the @entity50 can impose significant costs on @entity1 for its aggressive policies , reduce @entity23 's vulnerability to a natural gas embargo and curtail @entity76 's financial resources , it can count on @entity1 asserting military power when its leaders perceive threats to @entity1 interests in neighboring states			1
joint efforts with the @entity23 are essential			0
an across - the - board @entity87 - @entity23 freeze on assets would be foolhardy			0
@entity1 could easily retaliate against @entity87 and @entity23 investments in petroleum , autos , banking , and other sectors			2
however , targeted visa restrictions on travel to the @entity87 and @entity23 , and limited freezes on access to the bank accounts and real estate assets , for the @entity1 political and military leaders responsible for the @entity3 invasion would send a clear and poignant message			1
@entity23 should move quickly and decisively to develop their own natural gas and other alternatives			1
eliminating dependence on @entity1 gas might not end @entity1 's paranoia -- in fact it could feed it -- but it would at least deprive @entity76 of its ability to threaten @entity23 with embargoes and neighboring states with military actions			1
@entity1 could try to sell more natural gas in @entity139 , but those prospects are limited			0
already , @entity1 oil producers simply burn off huge amounts of gas they ca n't sell in @entity23			1
the @entity87 should not quickly volunteer to send @entity23 liquefied natural gas			2
@entity31 , @entity32 and several other @entity23 countries have shunned the environmental risks of developing shale gas and nuclear power			0
the @entity87 should insist @entity23 share the environmental risks the high cost of liquefying and shipping @entity87 gas to @entity23 requires that @entity23 also develop its own resources to fully unyoke itself from dependence on @entity1 and limit their strategic vulnerability			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			0

@entity158 : @entity1 will not cede control of the @entity3 any time soon
@entity158 : near time , @entity1 has upper hand since it supplies @entity23 with energy
he says @entity23 must move quickly to develop its own gas and oil industries
@entity158 : @entity1 's aggressive policies wo n't go away unless @entity23 gets more *leverage*
