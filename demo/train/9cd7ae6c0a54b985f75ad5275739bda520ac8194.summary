-- the @entity2 oil refinery whose explosions killed 42 people suffers mismanagement , delays in major maintenance and underinvestment , according to analysts and an engineering firm 's recent report			1
the state - run oil company that operates the refinery has been hampered by how @entity2 president @entity17 uses the refineries as " a cash cow " to fund social programs such as building homes for low - income voters , taking funds away from plant improvements , an analyst said			1
@entity2 is one of the world 's largest oil exporters			1
the fires at the @entity31 refinery since saturday have been described as " the most lethal industry accident in @entity2 to date " by analysts and come as the country faces other infrastructure problems , apparently because of a lack of maintenance , including a bridge collapse in @entity39 , analysts said			1
the @entity40 of @entity2 said this week , however , that the 197 - foot bridge was rebuilt in record time			2
new tank burns at @entity2 refinery ; death toll revised down in the aftermath of the fires , the government 's refinery manager said the explosion was n't due to a lack of maintenance , according to government television			1
@entity17 has also said that such suggestions are " irresponsible " because investigators are still trying to determine the cause of the accident			0

earlier this year , an engineering firm 's inspection of the giant @entity66 refinery complex in @entity68 state , which includes the @entity31 plant , found problems in major and routine maintenance , according to a march 2012 report prepared by @entity73 of @entity74			1
the report also said 100 fires occurred in 2011 at the refinery complex , which includes a second refinery called @entity79			0
the @entity31 refinery is one of the world 's largest , producing more than 1 million barrels per day , according to @entity84			0
the engineer firm 's report was circulated on the @entity87 , and @entity0 confirmed its authenticity through a source who had a copy of the original			1
" overall , we see some positive progress , although we continue to rate this large refinery complex as ' in need of improvement ' as in 2010 , " the report said			0
" a stronger ' proactive ' approach is necessary in our opinion			0
" major maintenance ( turnarounds ) has been seen to be suffering from delays , typically of one or two years , " the report said			2
" routine maintenance suffered a significant ' low ' in 2009 , the effects of which are still being felt , evidenced by a marked increase in the ratio of corrective to preventive maintenance , " the study said			2
" the effects are also evident in the maintenance backlog particularly for pumps and motors , and in a higher than target proportion of ' emergency ' and ' @entity120 ' work orders			0
" the deadly incidents at @entity2 's largest refinery highlight serious problems at the state - run refineries and are " a reminder of the bleak outlook for the company 's declining production and investment capacity , " said the analysis firm @entity132 in a note wednesday to investors and media			1

@entity17 is up for re-election in october , and while the accident is " not a game changer , " it could help boost the chances of opposition candidate @entity143 , the analysis firm said			2
the state - run oil company is faced with " significant operational problems stemming from both severe mismanagement and underinvestment , " the analysts said			1
when @entity17 overhauled the oil company in recent years , he fired numerous senior managers and experts with technical know - how , said @entity132 analyst @entity155			1
at the same time , the company has taken on more responsibilities , as @entity17 uses oil revenues for subsidies to the elderly and families with children , among other programs , @entity155 said			2
" the company has been stretched in a lot of different directions , and they do n't have the money to make the investments they need , " especially in the past two years as @entity17 has prepared for this fall 's elections , @entity155 said			2
" he 's really been doling out money , and a lot of the money has been coming from @entity61 's funds , " @entity173 said			0
" it 's turning out to be the cash cow for the government			0
" the engineering firm 's report was prepared at the request of the oil company 's underwriters and examined progress made on recommendations by the underwriters ' risk engineers during their survey visits in 1993 , 2002 , 2005 , 2007 and 2010 , the study said			1
at the time of the march assessment , the refinery complex was faced with 46 action items , and the engineering firm found that 11 of them had " no progress , " 19 were " in progress , " and 16 were completed , the report said			0
the report also found 222 reported incidents at the two refineries , " including some 100 fires , many of these being in contaminated pipe trenches , " the report said			0
" although there is a good procedure for incident investigation , we were disappointed to not ( e ) that few had progressed past the stage of setting up a study committee , and only nine were ' closed ' , with recommendations carried out , " the report said			0
among those killed at the @entity31 fires were 18 members of the national guard and 15 civilians , officials said			0
