-- @entity2 football star @entity1 woke up to headlines of " @entity4 " and " @entity5 " on wednesday			1
football matches between @entity7 and @entity8 have always been cannon fodder for @entity11 's red - top tabloids and @entity12 and the @entity13 -- which have built their reputation on the use of puns in headlines -- duly went to town after a major @entity20 game			1
their banner headlines -- the @entity12 went for " @entity4 " while the @entity13 had " @entity5 " -- were a reference to the red card awarded to @entity1 , who was playing for @entity24 in a @entity26 first - leg tie against @entity27 on tuesday -- after he fouled @entity29 star @entity28			1
but the two tabloids , who rely heavily on sport coverage to attract readers , have paid a price for their puns			0
in @entity7 , schwein literally means pig , but in everyday language in @entity2 it 's used as insult and @entity7 view it as a derogatory term			0
outraged by the headlines , @entity24 have banned the two newspapers from attending wednesday 's second - leg match at the club 's @entity45 stadium			1
the reigning @entity7 and @entity20 champions described the headlines as " disrespectful , discriminatory and personally insulting " in an official statement			0
" especially in the @entity26 where @entity50 has organized a big campaign called ' respect ' where all players are required to wear that logo on their shirts , " added the club			0
" therefore representatives of ' the @entity13 ' and ' @entity12 ' will not be granted media accreditation at the @entity45 for the @entity27 match			1
" the @entity13 declined to comment when contacted by @entity0 , while @entity12 said : " we 're currently talking to @entity24			1
" it 's the latest example of @entity11 tabloids aiming misguided barbs towards @entity2			2
ahead of a @entity65 semifinal between @entity29 and @entity2 in 1996 , @entity13 's front page declared " @entity66 ! surrender " next to pictures of @entity8 players wearing @entity71 helmets			0
an editorial in the paper read as a mock declaration of war			0
while @entity24 punished the two @entity11 clubs , the @entity7 club has confirmed it has accepted its own punishment handed out by @entity20 football 's governing body @entity50 after their fans displayed a homophobic banner during a match against @entity83			2
as a result , a part of the @entity45 will be closed for the match on april 9			0
" due to breaching this agreement when four attendees at our game with @entity83 showed a disrespectful banner in the @entity45 , 700 fans will now be locked out ( for the @entity27 game ) and we were fined â ‚ ¬ 10,000 , " added @entity24 in their statement			2
" we have accepted this			0
" tuesday 's game finished 1 - 1 , leaving @entity26 holders @entity24 as favorites to reach the semifinals .			1
