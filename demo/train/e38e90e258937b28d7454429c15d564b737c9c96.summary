-- over its extensive history , @entity2 entertainment has seen its share of successes and failures			1
it started out small , with viewfinder - like devices that were exclusive novelty items for the wealthy			2
by the middle of the 20th century , @entity2 was being marketed to everyone , as the movie industry tried to both capitalize on the technology and compete with television			2
in recent years , @entity2 has tried to invade the home , struggling to define itself as the new standard of digital entertainment			2
and some mobile gadgets are boasting 3 - d screens as well			1
it has n't been a smooth journey			0
three - dimensional technology has disappeared and reappeared countless times , and its fitful progress has been marked with both big hits and major misses			2
now comes news that @entity28 on wednesday is expected to introduce its first phone , possibly one with a @entity2 screen that does n't require special glasses			1
will this be the next big thing in the ebb and flow that is @entity2 advancement ? maybe			2
but for some context , here 's a look back at the rocky evolution of 3 - @entity40 modest roots 3 - d technology has been around for 170 years , longer than most people realize			1
first used for photos , it transitioned to motion pictures in 1915 with the invention of @entity48 -- the process of viewing two differently filtered images through colored glasses to produce an integrated image that the brain interprets as three - dimensional			2
the first public 3 - d movie , a melodrama called " @entity55 , " screened for theater owners in 1922 in @entity57			1
as was standard for movies of that era , it was in black and white and silent			0
it vanished without a trace			0
during @entity66 , the military 's use of @entity2 photography monopolized the industry			0
but the technology had disappeared from movie screens			0
the first rise and fall as the popularity of television skyrocketed after @entity66 , 3 - d movies made a brief splash in 1952 with the wildly successful movies " @entity76 " and " @entity77			1
" " the movie industry was throwing anything they could at the threat of television , " said @entity78 , director of the @entity79 for @entity80 and @entity81 at @entity82			0
" in order to keep people coming and paying , as opposed to staying at home for free , they had to give them something extra			0
" the creation of @entity94 filters and interlocking projectors enhanced the quality of 3 - d films , but the viewing experience was still uncomfortable for the audience			1
the images needed to be perfectly aligned , which was difficult to do , and many people complained of sore eyes after 30 minutes			0
producers limited their 3 - d output to horror movies , which played on viewers ' discomfort			1
but @entity2 movies soon died again , as many theaters shifted back to 2 - d with the invention of @entity111 , which presented movies in an ultrawide format			1
cost was also a large factor in its decline , as two prints of a movie were needed to project the image over itself			0
using the logic that two reels equaled two separate films , distributors charged theaters for both prints , but customers were unwilling to pay twice the cost for the movie			0
theaters abandoned the more expensive films , trying to draw back their audiences with more reasonably priced 2 - @entity2 movies , and @entity2 disappeared once again			1
from ' @entity132 ' to ' avatar ' in the 1960s , a huge breakthrough in 3 - d technology , @entity135 , removed the need for two cameras to project the movies , decreasing the cost for theater owners			1
" @entity132 , " a 1969 soft - core porn film , was the first movie to be released in @entity142 , using anamorphic lenses with a series of @entity94 filters to widen the picture			0
the movie became the most lucrative 3 - d film of its time , costing only $ 100,000 to make and grossing more than $ 27 million in @entity150			1
but @entity2 movies tapered off again due to cost , lingering viewing discomfort and the public 's disinterest in the antiquated @entity2 glasses			1
at the turn of a new century , @entity2 successfully reintegrated into mainstream films , this time targeting a younger audience with big studio releases of " @entity161 " and numerous other films			0
once again , @entity2 was back in the public 's favor and has held a steady audience since			0
the release of @entity169 's @entity168 - winning film " @entity133 " in 2009 blew the industry wide open			0
a huge influx of @entity2 movies ensued in the following years , but " @entity133 " still remains the highest grossing @entity2 film so far , raking in over $ 760 million			2
the production and box office success of @entity2 movies continues today , with more than 50 movies scheduled for release in the next two years and most movie theaters offering at least one @entity2 picture at all times			1
@entity78 said that @entity2 wo n't ever be 100 % of film production , because not all movies need it			1
but , he said , " a movie that does @entity2 really well just wo n't be as good without it			2
" no - glasses @entity2 moves closer to reality @entity2 moves into homes despite its successful return to movie theaters , @entity2 entertainment hit another stumbling block in its efforts to take over consumers ' living rooms			1
following the success of " @entity133 , " @entity2 televisions were hyped as the next big thing at the 2010 @entity196			2
but they never caught on , and four years later , many consider the attempt to bring @entity2 into the household a flop			0
the industry sold 1.1 million @entity202 in the first year , and sales have increased slightly since			0
but there 's still a shortage of @entity2 content being produced for them , and the televisions were largely missing from this year 's ces			0
@entity209 still has n't caught on the two main problems with 3 - d tvs are content and equipment , said @entity213 , principal consumer electronics analyst with @entity215 , a technology research and advisory firm			1
" over 50 percent of movies made in @entity2 are animated children 's movies , " he said in an e-mail			2
" although children are important in families , few affect the purchasing decisions of av equipment in the home			0
" @entity213 said the equipment issue is probably the biggest reason that 3 - d tvs have n't been successful in the home			1
the cost of buying a blu - ray player to go with the television or subscribing to a 3 - d channel on cable or satellite adds to the already steep cost			1
" then there 's those pesky glasses , " @entity213 said			0
" most tvs come with a limited number of glasses , and extra active glasses are relatively expensive			0
" the glasses also remain persistently uncomfortable			0
it 's not over yet for @entity246 , though , as prototypes of a glasses - free television are supposed to arrive within the next year			0
" @entity250 movies are going to take off as a viable alternative to 2 - @entity2 movies , the television must become standard equipment , " @entity78 said			2
" movies spend a very brief time in theater release , but they spend the rest of their existence on televisions			0
" a @entity246 you would actually want to buy what the future holds although tv has seen mixed results , @entity2 seems to have migrated successfully to mobile gadgets			1
the initial release of the @entity268 handheld gaming system in 2011 , although underwhelming , marked another turning point in the technology			0
the @entity268 was the first glasses - free @entity2 entertainment product			1
after a slow start -- the device sold just over 100,000 units in its first quarter -- @entity275 reported sales of 4.5 million units at the end of its first year , and sales remain strong			0
in 2014 , the industry continues to pursue the potential and advancements of @entity2 entertainment			1
if the predictions prove correct , and @entity28 does unveil a @entity2 phone , it might signal a new wave of possibilities			1
" smartphones will always be small , " @entity78 said			0
" although a @entity2 phone without glasses will be cool , it 's nothing like the big screen			1
" but having 3 - d graphics on a smartphone would still be better than not having them , he said			2
" if this ( phone screen ) looks great without glasses , it would be a huge breakthrough			2
" or , if @entity2 's history is any indicator of what 's to come , an @entity28 phone could be just another peak in the technology 's long roller coaster ride .			1

@entity28 is expected to reveal a new phone at an event wednesday
phone is *rumored* to have a @entity2 screen that would n't require special glasses
@entity2 entertainment has had a long history of mixed success
