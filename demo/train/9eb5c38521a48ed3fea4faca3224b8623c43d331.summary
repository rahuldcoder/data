this is another one of those stories that seems absolutely hard to believe			0
a 6 - year - old boy near @entity3 , @entity4 , was suspended from school for kissing a girl on the hand			1
" it was during class , " first - grader @entity10 said in an interview with @entity13 affiliate @entity12			1
" we were doing reading group , and i leaned over and kissed her on the hand			2
" not only did @entity10 's peck get him suspended from school , but the school accused him of sexual harassment , @entity12 reported			1
@entity10 's mom , @entity26 , is outraged			0
" this is taking it to an extreme that does n't need to be met with a 6 - year - old , " @entity26 told krdo			1
now my son 's asking questions , ' what is sex , mommy ? ' " she said @entity10 had problems at school before , getting suspended for rough - housing and for kissing the same girl on the cheek			1
the family has been working with him on " class disruptions " by grounding him and giving him " big restrictions , " @entity26 said			0
@entity44 , the superintendent of @entity45 , told @entity12 that @entity10 's record will remain within the district and that his behavior fits the school policy description of sexual harassment , which includes unwanted touching			1
" our main interest in this is having the behavior stop because the story is not just about the student that was disciplined , it is also about the student receiving the unwanted advances , " @entity44 told @entity52			0
" we have to think about both students in the situation			0
" @entity26 said the girl in question was " fine with it " because @entity10 and the girl consider themselves " boyfriend and girlfriend			0
" the girl 's parents have not commented publicly on the issue			2
but @entity26 wants her son 's record cleared of anything suggesting sexual harassment			1
on wednesday , @entity26 told @entity13 that the boy 's school principal would ask the superintendent to reconsider removing the term sexual harassment from @entity10 's record			1
the superintendent did not return a phone call from @entity13			1
" remove it from his record , " @entity26 told @entity12			1
" i need to stand up and fight for him			0
i ca n't just let that happen because it 's not the case			0
it 's not what happened at all			0
" @entity10 for his part said he feels " sorry " for doing something wrong and tries to be good in school			0
" but i just have a lot of energy			0
six - year - olds , they have a lot of energy , " @entity10 said			1
they sure do , and as a parent of a 6 - year - old and a 7 - year - old , an innocent peck on the cheek or on the hand seems as natural for kids this age as declarations of who they plan to marry			1
they do n't know anything about sex or sexual harassment			1
so how on earth can they be accused of such behavior ? reaction online to @entity10 's story has been swift , with the majority of commenters expressing pure outrage			2
" the school probably traumatized the kid for life with that stupid move , " wrote @entity125 on the @entity127 page for " @entity128			0
" " poor child , he 's ( too ) young to even know what sexual harassment is , " @entity133 also wrote on @entity127			1
" another example of how we are now overreacting to something as simple as a childhood crush , " @entity138 wrote			0
@entity143 , also on @entity127 , said he kissed a girl when he was 6			2
his punishment ? " i remember writing on the chalkboard ' i will not kiss girls at school , ' and it was a private @entity150 school ... go figure			0
" on the other side , there are a small number of people voicing some support for the school 's actions			2
" the kid should n't go around kissing someone 's child			2
because if it was my daughter , the parents and i would be talking			0
let 's keep it real , " @entity165 wrote on @entity127			0
we clearly need to hear more from the school and the school 's district because this might turn out to be another case where the pressure to follow set school rules gets in the way of common sense			2
we saw this recently with two other stories : the @entity180 school heavily criticized for banning most ball playing and even requiring supervision of games of tag while the school yard was under construction , and in @entity191 , where a student who allegedly went to a party to drive a friend home who was drunk was suspended from playing on her school 's volleyball team			2
