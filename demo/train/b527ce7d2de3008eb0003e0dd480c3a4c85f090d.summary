@entity25 , @entity26 : an educational overhaul ? that issue is first up in today 's show			2
first up : education reform @entity25 : " we can not afford to let the relative decline of @entity6 education continue			1
" those , the words of president @entity38 as he unveiled a proposal to overhaul the country 's educational system			1
some critics argue that the president is tackling too many issues , but mr. @entity38 says @entity6 does n't have the luxury to address one challenge at a time			1
this latest proposal touches on everything from test scores to teacher salaries to the amount of time you spend in school			2
( @entity56 ) @entity57 : it 's a five - pronged approach to reforming education in @entity6 , and president @entity38 says it would span from the cradle through career			1
first , he 's calling for more spending on early childhood programs			2
for example , some first - time parents would get regular visits from nurses who 'd check on kids and , the president says , help prepare them for school and life			2
second , mr. @entity38 wants to toughen and clarify testing standards			2
he believes schools have reacted to lower test scores by simply lowering expectations			2
to fight that , @entity38 wants funding for the " @entity82 " program to be tied to results			2
simply put : increase student performance , get more money			2
the third tier aims to recruit and train teachers			2
money from the stimulus plan has been set aside to offset teacher layoffs			2
one controversial point though : @entity38 wants good teachers to get paid more			2
teachers ' unions and critics say that could cause school officials to play favorites			2
the unions also have a problem with this : @entity38 wants more charter schools , schools that do n't answer to the local school board and have different approaches to education			2
the president wants to end limits on the number of these schools that states allow			2
but teachers ' unions say charter schools take the money that public schools should get			0
and many teachers and students wo n't want to hear this : @entity38 wants longer school days and more of them			0
why ? @entity6 president @entity38 : the challenges of a new century demand more time in the classroom			1
@entity57 : higher education comes fifth on this list : increasing @entity123 awards			2
also , giving a $ 2,500 tax credit per year to help working families with their students ' college tuition			0
one goal : that the @entity6 would have the world 's highest proportion of college graduates by 2020			1
thing is , the president ca n't make all this happen ; his power is limited			0
so , we 'll have to keep our eyes on states to see what they do in the days ahead			0
( @entity141 ) @entity142 @entity57 : so , a five - point proposal , but we 're focusing on one that could have a direct impact on you : longer school days			2
you 've heard the president 's view - we want to hear yours ! and teachers , you 're invited too			0
@entity153 to our blog at @entity155 and tell us what you think			0
@entity157 @entity57 : following up on some financial news now			0
@entity159 , the man accused of running a $ 50 billion ponzi scheme , is expected to plead guilty to 11 criminal charges and he could go to jail for the rest of his life			0
@entity159 , arrested late last year			0
charged with scamming thousands of clients in a scheme that pays off early investors with money from new ones			0
@entity159 is expected to enter his guilty plea tomorrow			0
if that happens , the judge says he 'll sentence @entity159 in several months			0
@entity173 @entity174 , @entity26 : time for the shoutout ! which of these countries is @entity11 ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a , @entity183 , c or @entity185 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! on this map , @entity185 is @entity11 , a nation that 's home to nearly 33 million people			1
@entity11 women at risk @entity57 : president @entity38 says he 'll consider talking with some members of the @entity13 to try and bring peace to @entity11			1
the militant group controlled the nation before being thrown out of power in 2001 , and it was criticized for its harsh rule			2
a leading @entity11 activist says any negotiations with the @entity13 need to address the issue of women 's rights			1
( @entity56 ) @entity201 , @entity0 reporter : it was @entity6 's promise to the women and girls of @entity11 : empowerment after years of @entity13 oppression			1
@entity209 : the @entity13 told us not to go to school			1
we were afraid because those who tried to learn were beaten			2
@entity213 : today , more than seven years after @entity6 troops toppled the @entity13 , the @entity11 government says 2 million @entity11 girls now go to school			1
but there is evidence the @entity13 and the dark days are returning			1
@entity220 provides shelter in @entity11 for women and girls who are victims of violence			1
@entity213 : do many women still fear the @entity13 ? @entity226 , voice of women organization : yeah , even i feel fear sometimes because when i , when i receive death threats , when i 'm going to the office , i do n't use the same way that every day i 'm going			1
i change the routes to go to the office			0
i can not share my schedule even with my friends , with my staff , and even sometimes i 'm not secure talking on phone			0
@entity213 : @entity240 says violence against girls grows by the day			0
four months ago , men on motorcycles used water pistols to spray acid on a group of girls walking to school			0
the incident was widely condemned , as were other @entity13 - inspired acts against women , by @entity6 's new secretary of state			1
@entity254 , @entity6 secretary of state this is not culture			1
@entity213 : @entity240 says @entity260 's words brought a renewed optimism , which promptly dissipated when president @entity38 floated an idea to reach out to @entity13 moderates to bring peace to @entity11			1
@entity265 : this is a hard question for now			0
@entity213 : she says if the @entity13 is brought in , women 's rights must be on the table			1
but as of monday , there were no clear assurances from the state department			0
@entity273 , state department spokesman : well , i think you have to wait until our policy review is done before , you know , drawing any conclusions on anything			0
@entity213 : despite her worries , @entity240 will go back to @entity11 with hope			1
@entity265 : and i know when i see that you are enjoying your freedom in this beautiful country , and i know , i believe it does n't come by itself			0
it was the result of hard work of a group of dedicated women that put their lives at risk			2
@entity213 : the state department told us women 's rights are important and to keep in mind this idea of using moderate elements of the @entity13 is just that right now : an idea			1
@entity201 , @entity0 , @entity301			0
( @entity141 ) @entity302 ! @entity174 : see if you can i.d. me ! i was born in @entity17 in 1935			1
i assumed power as the @entity14 leader in 1950			0
i won the @entity307 in 1989			0
i 'm the @entity308 , and i 've lived in exile , away from my home country , since 1959			0
@entity14 @entity18 relations @entity57 : this month marks the 50th anniversary of when the @entity308 left @entity17 during an uprising against the @entity18 government			1
the spiritual leader says @entity18 has made life " @entity319 " for @entity316 in the time since , but @entity18 blames the decades - long conflict on the @entity308			1
@entity321 traces the tense history between the two sides			1
( @entity56 ) @entity324 , @entity0 reporter : the @entity325 , a stunning landmark and symbol of @entity14 nationalism			0
it was also home to the spiritual leader of @entity17 , the @entity308			1
but now , it 's capped by the red flag of @entity18			1
let 's step back in time to find out how this came to be			0
while the 20th century is still young , @entity18 's last emperor has been overthrown , rival warlords vie for power with a weak central government , and @entity17 , which was nominally under @entity18 rule during the last dynasty , declares its independence			1
in 1940 , a five - year - old boy from a peasant family is enthroned as the latest reincarnation in a line of 13 previous @entity308 , and venerated as the god - king ruler of @entity17			1
in 1950 , having pacified @entity18 , the new communist government in @entity349 turns its attention to this remote mountainous region			1
its armies move on @entity353			0
@entity18 leader @entity354 offers automony but also demands obedience			1
smiles for the cameras here , but back home , resentment against @entity18 rule is brewing			1
and then , on march 10 , 1959 , violence erupts in @entity353			0
a @entity14 uprising against @entity18 rule fails			1
exiles claim some 86,000 tibetans are killed			0
after weeks of unrest , the @entity308 and his ministers flee @entity17 and go into exile in northern @entity369			1
they are soon joined by tens of thousands of followers			0
during decades of exile in @entity373 , @entity369 , the @entity308 continues to press @entity18 to give autonomy to @entity17			1
he becomes a cause celebre in the west , but talks with @entity349 never get anywhere			0
the run up to the @entity379 in @entity349 sees another round of violence in @entity17			1
in march last year , angry @entity14 protesters take to the streets in @entity353 , targeting and even killing @entity384			0
@entity349 responds with a brutal crackdown			0
this month , it 's lockdown in @entity17			1
foreigners are banned from entering , and security is intense			0
@entity18 is n't taking any chances			1
( @entity141 ) before we go @entity57 : well , before we leave you today , we 're bringing you a distinct downside to living in a beachfront home			0
it might look like this wall of ice is meant to keep people out , but the ice is actually working its way in ! strong winds helped the force of nature force its way inside these homes			0
luckily , everyone got out in time			0
but there was nothing anyone could do about the invading ice , which was advancing about 20 feet every half hour			0
goodbye @entity57 : must have been a chilling scene			0
that puts today 's show on ice			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity31 .			0
