-- thus far , @entity2 's late - night transition has been like butter			1
@entity4 hosted his final episode of " @entity6 " on february 6 with massive celebrity support and even bigger ratings , and @entity9 took over on february 17 with the same level of excitement			2
but there 's still one more piece of the @entity15 's puzzle left to be added : @entity16			1
at 12:35 a.m. , the 40 - year - old " @entity18 " star will step behind the desk of " @entity20 " and occupy a chair once filled by @entity22 , @entity23 and , directly before him , his pal and fellow " @entity18 " alum @entity25			1
with that kind of history , it goes without saying that there 's pressure on @entity16 not to screw up			1
yet instead of marching in and tearing down " @entity20 's " past , @entity16 is planning to keep tradition intact while playing to his strengths			1
after 12 years on " snl , " nine of which he served as head writer , @entity16 is by all accounts more of a cerebral comedian than a performer			1
his colleagues give him credit for being the guy who 'd rather set up the joke than steal the thunder , and some of his best work does n't even include his face			2
see : @entity46 as @entity47 : or @entity48 as @entity49 : or @entity50 killing it as a rapping @entity47 : " there 's the class clown , and then there 's the guy who sits in the back and says an aside about the class clown , " @entity16 said to @entity57			1
" on the surface , that tendency to hang back would make @entity64 appear to be an ill fit for " @entity20 , " whose most recent host liked to slow jam the news , throw down in lip - sync battles and play beer hockey with guests			1
but as @entity25 takes his eager energy over to " @entity6 , " there 's more room in @entity2 's line - up for a more even , straight player -- someone who can tackle politics with the same ease as a @entity80 scandal			2
@entity16 ' first week of guests sets the stage for that kind of high - low mix : the first two guests on " @entity20 " will be his old " snl " co-star @entity50 , along with vice president @entity86			1
" we want it to be not just creative people in the showbiz world , but we 'd also love to have authors , politicians , athletes , " @entity16 told reporters of his ideal guest list earlier this year			2
" we are open to everything and hopefully can get interesting people on not only that the audience knows , but the audience can get to know			0
" tweaking the type of guests " @entity20 " viewers are used to seeing is the kind of risk that @entity16 ' " @entity20 " producer and champion , @entity107 , wants to see			1
" in my opinion , he has until next fall to find that show , " @entity107 told @entity108			0
" he should be taking chances			0
it ca n't spring full - blown from @entity115 ' thigh on february 24			1
i do n't want @entity16 to put pressure on himself or think that his show has to have that level of polish			2
it should find its way			0
i do think he 's way better prepared than @entity122 ( @entity23 ) was when he began			0
" better prepared or not , there is one @entity23 trick that @entity16 would like to incorporate			2
the format of " @entity20 " will still be pretty standard , with an opening monologue and an interview or two			2
but @entity16 also wants to use his writing staff as a sort of communal sidekick that would allow him to do the kind of interviews with fictional characters fans remember from " @entity18			2
" ( so does this mean that we 'll get to see @entity138 's now - retired character @entity137 at some point ? " @entity140 and i spoke during my last ' snl , ' and we do think he 'll turn up eventually , " @entity16 has said			1
) " i want it to look and have the framework of the classic late - night model , but this is real estate where you can try out everything , " he told @entity142			1
" i liked how @entity122 used his writing staff to play different people			0
we have a writing staff that has a lot of that range			0
they 're great writers , but they 're also really funny performers			0
we are going to try to use them as often as we can			0
in a weird way , the closest thing i 'll have to a sidekick is my writing staff and the people they 'll play			0
" as the hour approaches , @entity16 , a known " worrier " with a tendency to decimate office furniture when he 's nervous , seems to have a zen approach to his late - night debut			1
he 's fully expecting to have low moments -- " there 's no way i 'm not going to spin out , " as he told the hollywood reporter -- but he 's also taking this one episode at a time			0
" ' @entity173 ' was a big thing to step into			0
' snl ' was a big thing to step into , " he told the @entity175			0
" i think i 've found over the years , if you get too hung up on the legacy of what you are taking over , it gets in the way a little bit of doing the work			0
so our goal is just to try to do the funniest thing we can every night and get better each time out			0

@entity16 will take over " @entity20 " on february 24
he 's known for being a writer more than a performer
but playing the straight guy can work to his *advantage* on " @entity20 "
he 's planning to keep the classic late - night model with a few twists
