editor 's note : this story is based on interrogation reports that form part of the prosecution case in the forthcoming trial of six @entity8 citizens charged with participation in a terrorist group			1
versions of those documents were obtained by @entity13 from the defense attorney of one of those suspects			0
the statement by @entity18 was compiled from an interview he gave @entity8 prosecutors in march 2009 in @entity22 , and was confirmed by @entity24 prosecutors as authentic			1
the statement by @entity26 was given to @entity28 investigators , and was authenticated by @entity8 prosecutors			0
@entity18 is believed to have lived in this @entity30 , @entity22 , house with his father until 2007			2
( @entity13 ) -- on september 10 , 2007 , almost exactly six years after @entity32 attacked the @entity24 , @entity18 , a 24 - year - old @entity33 citizen born in @entity34 , @entity22 , boarded a flight from the city en route to @entity38 , in eastern @entity39 , determined to fight jihad in neighboring @entity41			1
brought up a @entity42 by his @entity33 immigrant parents , who divorced when he was young , @entity18 tried to join the @entity44 in 2002 but dropped out after just a few weeks			1
in 2004 -- for reasons which are still unclear -- he converted to @entity47 and started frequenting a mosque in @entity49 near where he lived with his father			0
during the next three years he became radicalized , @entity24 officials have stated , in no small part because of his exposure to pro-al @entity32 web sites			1
it is possible that @entity18 was also influenced by people he came across in the @entity22 area			2
a former @entity24 government official told @entity13 that youths influenced by the ideas of the @entity65 pro-al @entity32 extremist group @entity63 were known to have hung out in the vicinity of the mosque at the same time as @entity18			1
read how @entity32 is changing the former official told @entity13 that they were a splinter group of the @entity63 followers who used to hang out in the @entity22 - @entity49 area in the late 1990s and early 2000s			2
@entity63 's @entity33 members , the former official stated , included @entity74 , a @entity75 college graduate who traveled to @entity39 in 2003 and now awaits trial on charges of providing material support to the terrorist network			2
he has pleaded not guilty			0
another who belonged to @entity63 was @entity82 , a trainee @entity34 taxi driver , who met two of the july 7 , 2005 , @entity85 bombers in @entity39 and who in 2004 pleaded guilty to providing material support to terrorists in @entity39			2
@entity63 was formally disbanded in october 2004 but still operates , @entity13 has discovered , under a variety of guises			0
@entity90 , the former deputy leader of @entity63 , told @entity13 monday that @entity22 was one of the organization 's main hubs before 2004			0
he says dozens of followers from the @entity96 still regularly tune into online sermons put together by the group 's founder @entity98 in @entity100 , @entity101 , where he has been living since being banned from the @entity65 after the 2005 @entity85 bombings			2
@entity90 stated that he and @entity103 were still loosely affiliated with the @entity104 , a @entity22 based organization , which says the peaceful restoration of the @entity106 is one of its objectives			0
a march 5 , 2009 , posting on the homepage of its web site states that @entity98 is " a man who has inspired thousands across the world to rise for @entity47			0
" the @entity104 exists legally in the @entity24 and says it is committed solely to the political and intellectual struggle for @entity47			2
when @entity18 arrived in @entity38 he had little idea about how he was going to gain access to the fighting in @entity41 , according to his own account			2
but a few days after he arrived he sought help from a @entity22 friend , whom he knew moved in militant circles			0
one introduction led to another and eventually @entity18 met a jihadist commander about to return to @entity41			1
identified in legal documents as @entity128 , the commander agreed to let him join his group			2
@entity13 has learned from a source briefed on the case that the initials s.s. stand for a man who goes by the name of @entity135 , and is believed to be somewhere in @entity39 's tribal areas			2
at the end of september , @entity18 was whisked in the commander 's car into @entity39 's tribal areas and then across the border into @entity41 to join up with a small band of fighters targeting a @entity24 base			1
the raid , however , was called off at the last minute because of @entity33 aircraft circling above			0
his quick introduction to the fighting appears to have been unusual			0
@entity18 stated it was standard for fighters to undergo military training before being selected for such missions			0
read how @entity32 training tactics are adapting it is possible he persuaded his handlers that his brief stint as a @entity24 army recruit justified him being fast - tracked ; or perhaps the jihadist group just needed more fighters			1
on his return to @entity160 , a district in @entity39 's tribal areas , @entity18 was asked by one of the fighters if he wanted to become a suicide bomber			1
@entity18 , according to his own account , accepted and was sent to @entity166 , @entity39 , for more instruction			1
but his handlers there judged that he had not received enough religious instruction to launch such an attack			0
perhaps it was dawning on them just how valuable an @entity33 recruit might one day be			0
@entity18 stated that at this point he traveled back to a village in @entity175 where he spent time with a number of @entity32 members , including @entity178 and @entity179			1
in march 2008 he successfully persuaded one of them , a @entity179 he identified as @entity182 , to recommend him for formal membership in the terrorist group			0
only @entity182 's initials appeared in the legal document but @entity13 obtained his name from a source briefed on the case			0
his current whereabouts are unknown			0
according to @entity18 , @entity32 recruits were asked to fill out forms with personal information and hand over their passports when they joined the organization , but were not required to sign a contract or take part in a ceremony to become a member of @entity32			1
between march and july 2008 @entity18 stated that he attended three @entity32 training courses , which focused on weapons , explosives , and rocket - based or - propelled weaponry			1
@entity18 stated that when training was completed , @entity32 instructors did a written evaluation of performances			1
@entity18 was judged qualified to participate in missile attacks against @entity24 and @entity210 bases in @entity41 , according to his account			1
during his travels @entity18 met some of @entity32 's top leaders , leaders he was able to identify to @entity24 authorities after his capture			1
read how @entity32 is looking at @entity219 targets according to @entity24 investigators , quoted by the @entity221 , @entity18 says he met with @entity222 , one of @entity32 's principal spokesmen , and @entity225 , the @entity65 @entity32 operative suspected of coordinating a plot against transatlantic aviation in august 2006			1
@entity225 , who was arrested that august in @entity39 , escaped from custody in december 2007 but is believed to have been killed in a @entity230 strike in @entity175 in november 2008			0
@entity18 says he also met with an individual by the name of @entity233 , whom he says replaced @entity235 as @entity32 's military chief in @entity41 and @entity39 in january 2008			1
a former @entity237 told @entity13 that @entity233 is almost certainly @entity238 , an @entity239 also known as @entity240			0
in june , @entity238 released an audio recording complaining of a lack of funds for the fighting in @entity41			0
@entity18 stated he met with @entity233 in the late summer of 2008 in @entity175 , and @entity32 's military chief personally instructed him to join a group of fighters targeting @entity24 bases from the tribal areas of @entity39			1
in january this year @entity18 pleaded guilty to having targeted an @entity33 base in september of that year			0
that attack , however , appears to have been a failure			0
creeping up towards the @entity33 forward operating base @entity18 and other @entity32 fighters ' first attempt to fire on the base was botched by radio problems			1
the second rocket attack fell short of the base , according to @entity18 ' account			2
@entity18 ' life as an @entity32 fighter saw him rotate between fighting behind enemy lines in @entity41 , training in remote mountain dwellings in the tribal areas , and spending downtime in @entity166 , the capital of @entity39 's @entity270 , where he was eventually arrested in november 2008 and transferred into @entity33 custody .			1
