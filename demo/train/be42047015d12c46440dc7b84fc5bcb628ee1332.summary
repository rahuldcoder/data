-- huddled in the hallway of his @entity3 home with three of his friends , @entity7 had a gut feeling to jump into a closet as the massive twister barreled into the @entity12 neighborhood			2
moments later , he was the only one to survive			2
" i just heard a voice in my head saying ' go to the closet , go to the closet , " @entity7 said			2
the closet walls pushed down on him as a roar surrounded him , followed by the sounds of pieces of the house snapping off			2

" said @entity218 , a weather service meteorologist in @entity219			0
" it 's one of those instances where you had very large tornadoes on very long tracks hitting heavily populated areas			1
" " when you put that together , you 're going to see large loss of life and massive devastation , " @entity218 said			0
