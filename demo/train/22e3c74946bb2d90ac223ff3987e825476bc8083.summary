-- angry supporters of the @entity4 president rallied saturday night at embassies and consulates of countries that voted hours earlier to suspend @entity4 's membership in the @entity9 , anti-government activists said			1
videos posted on @entity11 purportedly showed several of the events			0
one from @entity13 shows a large crowd of people chanting as they gathered outside @entity17 's embassy in @entity13			1
another , from @entity19 , shows angry backers of president @entity21 yelling as they appear to break through barriers at the @entity24 consulate			1
some demonstrators are seen taking a @entity24 flag , which previously hung over the consulate , and burning it			2
neither @entity11 video showed any evident violence			0
anti-government activists tell @entity0 that supporters of the @entity4 regime also attacked the @entity24 and @entity33 consulates in @entity34			1
@entity0 could not independently confirm the accounts because @entity4 has not granted international media access to the country			2
the developments came after 18 of the @entity9 's 22 members voted to punish @entity4 in an emergency session at its headquarters			1
the move to suspend @entity13 ' membership in the alliance -- a stinging blow to @entity21 -- takes effect wednesday			2
only two member nations -- @entity48 and @entity49 -- voted against the measure			0
@entity51 abstained and @entity4 was barred from voting			2
why did @entity9 move on @entity4 ? the league also called for sanctions against @entity21 's regime , but did not specify what those may include			1
@entity58 prime minister @entity57 read the league 's decisions at a news conference after the meeting of the foreign ministers			0
the league called on member states to withdraw their ambassadors from @entity13 , a decision that will be left up to each nation			0
and perhaps most surprising of all , the league urged the @entity4 army to stop attacks on civilians and said that it will hold a meeting with opposition groups in the next three days to discuss a transitional phase in @entity4 's future			1
the @entity75 , a leading opposition group , welcomed the league 's decision , calling it " a step in the right direction , and a clear condemnation of the @entity4 regime			1
" " the @entity75 emphasizes its readiness to participate in discussions regarding the transitional period within the scope of the @entity9 , to ensure the stepping down of @entity21 and the transition to a democratic government that represents the @entity4 people and does not ( include ) anyone from the regime whose hands have been tainted with blood , " it said in a statement			1
the fact that the league , the formal family of @entity99 states , took such a bold step against a nation that prides itself as the beating heart of @entity103 , is a major development , said @entity105 , director of the @entity106 at the @entity107			0
" @entity4 is now as isolated as ever , " @entity105 said			2
" i would call it a game - changer			0
" the @entity9 's stated purpose is to strengthen ties among its member nations , coordinate their policies and promote common interests			1
but the divisions among the 22 nations have diminished its effectiveness			0
in the case of @entity4 , however , the league 's decision could open the door for broader international sanctions against the @entity21 regime			1
the punitive measures come after @entity21 's failure to abide by an @entity9 proposal earlier this month to halt all violence , release detainees , withdraw armed elements from populated areas and allow unfettered access to the nation by journalists and @entity9 monitors			2
but none of that has happened , according to daily reports streaming out of @entity4			2
there have been reports of civilian deaths in the last few days and saturday was no exception			0
the @entity141 , a network of opposition groups , reported 21 people dead , including 10 in @entity145 , the restive city that has emerged as the epicenter of the uprising			0
with pressure on @entity4 ratcheted up , some fear an escalation of brutality in the next few days			2
@entity4 's representative to the league , @entity152 , blasted the alliance 's decision as illegal			1
he said it was " a eulogy for @entity99 common action and a blatant announcement that its administration is subordinate to @entity165 - @entity164 agendas , " according to the state - run @entity157			0
earlier @entity152 had reiterated the government 's claim that terrorist gangs were behind the violence and said @entity4 " made strides " in quelling the violence " despite armed groups ' attempts to foil the plan since it was announced			2
" @entity164 leaders welcomed saturday 's decision			1
" after the @entity21 regime flagrantly failed to keep its commitments , the @entity9 has demonstrated leadership in its effort to end the crisis and hold the @entity4 government accountable , " said @entity165 president @entity177			1
" these significant steps expose the increasing diplomatic isolation of a regime that has systematically violated human rights and repressed peaceful protests , " he said in a statement			0
@entity165 secretary of state @entity190 echoed those comments , calling the action " strong and historic			0
" " the @entity165 commends the principled stand taken by the @entity9 and supports full implementation of its efforts to bring a peaceful end to the crisis , " @entity193 said in a statement			0
@entity33 foreign minister @entity201 said the league 's actions show " that it is time to increase pressure on the @entity4 regime			1
" human rights activists have been pushing for weeks for the @entity208 to take action and @entity210 said saturday that the @entity9 's decision should pave the way for the @entity213			1
" now that the @entity9 has taken decisive action , it is time for the @entity213 to finally step up to the plate and deliver an effective international response to @entity4 's human rights crisis , " said @entity214 , the monitoring group 's @entity106 and @entity217 director			1
@entity223 has also urged the @entity213 to impose sanctions			0
it published a damning 63 - page report friday , based on interviews with victims and witnesses in @entity145 , that said @entity21 's regime 's " systematic " crackdown on civilians amounted to crimes against humanity			0
the @entity235 said earlier this week that more than 3,500 people have been killed in the brutal suppression of dissent since the @entity4 uprising began eight months ago			0
@entity0 's @entity240 and journalist @entity241 in @entity242 contributed to this report .			0
