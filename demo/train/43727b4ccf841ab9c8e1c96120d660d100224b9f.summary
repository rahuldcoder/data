-- unless you 've been living under a rock , you know people are concerned about the deficit			1
or at least they say they are			2
you 'd also have to be willfully ignoring everything around you not to know that health care spending is a significant cause , if not the cause , of our long - term fiscal problems			1
the narrative that seems to be going around @entity14 argues that there are two schools of thought about how to improve our financial outlook			2
one side wants to cut spending			1
the other side wants to increase taxes			2
or , so it goes			2
i was out to dinner on saturday night with a friend who is rather pessimistic about compromise in our government			2
he believes that the chances for passing anything that might reduce spending on health care in the future are near zero			1
there 's just one problem with his outlook			2
we 've already passed a law that does a great deal to reduce future health care spending			1
i have argued many times that i do n't think the @entity45 does enough to contain costs			1
i still believe that 's true			0
but let 's not ignore the fact that it does a lot			0
more , in fact , than anything else passed by @entity52 and signed into law by a president in quite some time			0
right off the bat , we need to remember that the @entity45 makes significant cuts to future @entity60 spending			1
reductions in overpayments for @entity63 constitute almost $ 140 billion in savings over a decade			1
changes in the fee - for - service reimbursement schedule add up to almost $ 200 billion			0
that 's an enormous amount of money , so large that it scared many people into thinking that @entity60 would be severely curtailed			1
running against @entity60 cuts helped sweep the @entity72 into power in the @entity74 in 2010			1
often , such arguments came from the same people now decrying the @entity45 for not cutting health care spending enough			1
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg			0
there are lots of other payment reforms ( @entity84 ) that should " bend the curve " for @entity60 in the next decade			1
hospitals will be punished for re-admissions for certain conditions			0
this is expected to save $ 8.2 billion			1
refusing payments for hospital - acquired conditions should save another $ 3.2 billion			2
accountable care organizations , for better or for worse , are expected to save almost $ 5 billion in the first eight years as well			1
everyone hates waste in the system			0
the health care act does something about that as well			1
specifically , it strengthens our means to investigate and then go after people who abuse @entity60 or @entity103			1
the @entity104 has calculated that the health care act 's provisions for abuse of these programs could reduce spending by an additional $ 1.8 billion			1
surely you 've heard about the @entity111 ? this one , too , has cost the administration politically			2
it 's been demonized as an actual " death panel " of unelected , unaccountable people who will ration your @entity60			1
the panel is made up of people who need @entity122 approval ( not easy ) , and they do n't serve for life			0
moreover , they have a very specific , limited task			0
if , and only if , the amount of money @entity60 spends per person goes up faster than the consumer price index , the panel will make recommendations to @entity52 on how to get @entity60 to spend less			1
by statute , they ca n't " ration " care or increase premiums , deductibles or co-payments			2
still , what makes this a better cost control than what existed before is that these recommendations automatically become law unless @entity52 can pass a different plan that achieves the same savings			1
because @entity52 has a hard time passing anything these days , that 's not as likely to happen			0
the payment advisory board gets going in 2014 , and in just its first five years , it 's expected to reduce spending for all @entity60 programs by more than $ 23 billion ( @entity84 )			1
these are just mechanisms acting on government insurance , though			0
the @entity45 has some measures that affect private spending as well			1
the excise tax is one of those			0
starting in 2018 , plans that cost more than a certain amount will have a 40 % tax levied on employers who provide them			2
let 's acknowledge that such taxes will absolutely be passed on to regular people , so it does n't matter who is stuck with the bill at first			0
it 's also worth acknowledging that the levels where the tax kicks in are really high ( $ 10,200 for an individual plan and $ 27,500 for a family )			0
even so , many believe that this will eventually be one of the strongest levers the @entity45 contains to rein in spending in the future			1
we should also mention the insurance exchanges themselves			0
although it will take time to work out the kinks , the general idea is that the exchanges should reduce the administrative burden of individually rating and selling plans to consumers			2
insurance companies instead will have to compete on value , and try to negotiate with providers to reduce spending to remain competitive			2
we 'll have to see how well this works			0
finally , the law invests in the @entity196 and the @entity197 , which may lead to new ideas to contain costs as well			2
these are difficult to score , but they are being researched			0
you could argue that any one of these ( other than the cuts to @entity60 ) is on the smaller side			1
but when you add them up , they start to get significant			0
so much so , that the @entity104 estimates that the @entity45 reduced the long - term fiscal gap by 2 % of the gross domestic product over the next 75 years			1
that 's about 25 % to 33 % of what is necessary to stabilize the debt in the long run			0
granted , some of that deficit reduction comes from new taxes			2
but some of it also comes from reduction in future spending			1
parts of the act cost money			1
parts of the act save money			1
overall , it is deficit reducing			2
you may not like these types of efforts			0
they may offend your political sensibilities			0
you may favor a more consumer - driven type of system , or one that relies less on panels of experts			0
but there 's a difference between arguing that you want different measures and pretending those measures do n't exist			0
further , some have argued that these measures wo n't last			0
but you have to remember that right now , they are law			0
making them weaker requires action			0
specifically , it requires a @entity74 and @entity122 to pass something altering them , and then a president to agree to sign it			0
that 's hard to do in today 's environment			0
of course , some are campaigning on trying to do that right now			0
they want to overturn all of the above completely			0
that 's fine ; it 's their right			0
but it 's hard to understand how you can argue that the " other side " is n't serious about decreasing future health care spending while simultaneously working toward overturning the law it passed that does just that			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity272 .			1

@entity272 : idea that @entity72 wants to cut , @entity275 want to spend is a myth
@entity272 says the @entity45 cuts future costs of health care significantly , if not enough
cuts in @entity60 spending and *oversight* of abuses mean substantial savings , he says
@entity272 : parts of the act save money and some cost , but overall , it reduces the deficit
