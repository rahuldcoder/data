in many ways , the 2012 election was the year of the woman			2
women — who have historically formed one of president @entity6 's key constituencies — once again united behind him in large numbers and helped fend off defections from white male and independent supporters			1
a record 20 women will hold @entity13 seats next year — including newly - elected @entity15 democrat @entity14 , the first openly lesbian senator			1
the @entity18 congressional delegation will be all female and , in @entity6 's home state of @entity20 , democrat @entity16 will represent the islands in the @entity13			1
" i 'm not sure if it was as much a coincidence as a perfect storm , " said @entity22 , a senior editor with the nonpartisan @entity23			0
" the conditions were right and the @entity28 nominee gave women pause			2
" according to @entity33 's exit polls , 55 % of women and 45 % of men voted for @entity6 and 44 % of women and 52 % of men voted for @entity36			1
that level of female support for the president made an especially big impact in swing states like @entity42 where the gender breakdown mirrored the national figures			1
big gains for women in 2012 it is a gender advantage @entity6 clinched even as early as mid october when data showed that among white women , the president led 52 % -46 %			1
back in 2008 when @entity6 carried @entity42 , he received 47 % of votes from white women in that state			1
nationally , @entity6 received 56 % of the female vote in 2008			1
" i think it 's one of the things @entity28 have to look at , " @entity22 said			0
" ' why are we the party of white men			0
' " political experts also say @entity36 , who saw an early october surge of support among female voters , may have undone those gains during the second presidential debate when he said he used " whole binders full of women " as a hiring tool as governor , whiffed on an equal pay question , and alluded to helping women get home to cook dinner			1
" that a presidential candidate in 2012 can utter such superficial answers to a serious question about women 's economic equity and autonomy reveals a lack of serious thought about issues of substantive importance to women , " @entity72 , a political science professor at the @entity74 , and @entity75 , an associate professor of government and director of the @entity78 at @entity79 , wrote recently for @entity33			2
" it also demonstrates a lack of commitment to the change necessary to allow women and men to lead fully integrated professional and personal lives , " they said			2
but @entity28 woes with women can not be blamed solely on @entity36			2
opinion : women gain wider access to power verbal gaffes from down - ballot candidates such as rep. @entity107 , whose comments about a woman 's body preventing pregnancy after " legitimate rape " may have cost him the election , also reinforced for some voters concerns that the @entity28 is out of touch with women			1
" part of the reason @entity124 had a good day was some conservative @entity28 said some stupid things and it made some issues more salient than they usually are , " said @entity118 , an associate professor of political science at @entity120 in @entity121			0
" when people are making comments about legitimate rape ... it scares women who might not have thought about it			2
even the conversation about contraception ... this was a way to make women 's health issues very , very personal , " @entity118 said			0
the first portion of this year 's political season saw a heated partisan showdown over a federal mandate requiring religious institutions to offer contraception insurance coverage to employees			0
the ensuing back and forth sparked a " war on women " fight between @entity124 and @entity28 that bled into congressional hearings , the campaigns and talk radio and re-ignited the gender wars			0
democrats were able to use the rhetoric to suggest that @entity28 would threaten the right to contraception — something studies indicate the majority of the public supports , said @entity159 , a @entity161 @entity160 government professor			0
move over boys , @entity18 goes to the women " the debate can be more framed on the aspects of the debate that were more popular with the general public , " @entity159 said , adding that @entity124 were also able to connect other @entity28 positions on abortion as extreme			0
there are some indications that social issues directly impacting women might have helped sway votes in some states			0
tuesday 's early exit polls showed 51 % of @entity178 voters said they believed abortion should be legal all or most of the time			1
of those voters , exit polls showed 76 % supported @entity124 incumbent @entity183 , who won tuesday night , while 19 % voted for @entity107			1
forty - seven percent of @entity178 's voters said abortion should be illegal			0
exit polls showed @entity107 netted 67 % of this group 's votes while 27 % of people who think abortion should be illegal supported @entity183			0
but much more than social issues , pocketbook economic issues most concerned women voters , exit polling showed			0
" women like all voters felt the economics were most important , " @entity159 said			0
" women tend to be more supportive of government spending ( such as cutting things as @entity201 , and food stamps ) than men are ... so they were less responsive to @entity36 in that way and more responsive to @entity6 's message on empathy and helping the middle class			1

women were seen as the key to the election this week
president @entity6 got 55 % of the female vote on tuesday
the @entity13 will see a record 20 women take seats next term
