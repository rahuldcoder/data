@entity1 , whose upstart bid to unseat @entity4 sen. @entity3 sparked warfare in the @entity6 and within her own family , is dropping out of the primary race , she said on monday			1
" serious health issues have recently arisen in our family , and under the circumstances , i have decided to discontinue my campaign , " the eldest daughter of former vice president @entity10 said in a written statement			1
@entity10 , 47 , began telling associates of her decision over the weekend , @entity17 reported sunday night			2
she was not specific about the health issues involved in her decision			1
but @entity17 has learned from multiple sources close to the family that they involve at least one of her children			0
" though this campaign stops today , my commitment to keep fighting with you and your families for the fundamental values that have made this nation and @entity4 great will never stop , " she added			2
@entity10 called @entity3 , 69 , about her decision to bow out			1
" i talked to her first thing this morning			0
it was very nice that she called me , " he told @entity17 on @entity39 , adding that he respects @entity10 's decision and that " she and her family are in our prayers			1
" asked if he was relieved that she was no longer in the race , he said he has n't " had a chance to reflect on that yet			0
" @entity10 's surprising decision to jump into the race , an announcement made in a @entity55 video last summer , roiled @entity6 politics in @entity4 , a state that her father represented in @entity59 for five terms in the 1970s and 80s			1
@entity3 is a low - key presence in @entity62 in the @entity63			1
he was elected in 1996 and has amassed a conservative voting record with few blemishes			0
he expressed public annoyance at @entity10 's decision to mount a primary challenge			2
a number of his @entity63 colleagues quickly rallied to his side and pledged support for his re-election bid			0
there was little public polling of the race , but two partisan polls released last year showed @entity3 with a wide lead , an assessment mostly shared by @entity6 insiders watching the race			1
in a statement after her announcement to drop out , the @entity81 praised @entity1 for being a " stalwart supporter " and fundraiser for @entity4 candidates and county parties in the past			2
" @entity1 is a rising star in @entity4 and national politics and we look forward to her return when the time is right for her and her family , " the statement read			1
@entity10 's campaign got off to a rocky start			0
her critics labeled her a carpetbagger , noting that she moved to @entity4 only in 2012 after relocating from @entity99			0
the issue flared in august after the @entity4 media reported that @entity10 improperly received a fishing license despite not living in the state for at least a year , as the law requires			2
grabbing even more attention was her very public dispute with her sister , @entity107 , over the issue of same - sex marriage			0
@entity110 , who is a lesbian , took to @entity111 in november to object to @entity1 's opposition to same - sex marriage , claiming that her sister has previously supported her relationship while saying something very different on the campaign trail			0
the dispute prompted their parents to weigh in , saying they were " pained " to see the sisters battle over a private matter in full view of the news media			0
beyond the campaign missteps , @entity10 's election effort , vigorously supported by her father and his allies , often felt out of tune with the small - government conservative sentiment that has fueled other @entity6 primary challengers			2
@entity10 , like her father , is an unapologetic neoconservative who favors muscular use of @entity139 military power overseas , a policy that does not sit well with many grassroots conservatives , particularly in the libertarian - leaning @entity142			0
@entity10 ' surprised ' by public spat between daughters five @entity63 races to watch in 2014 all in the ( political ) family			1
