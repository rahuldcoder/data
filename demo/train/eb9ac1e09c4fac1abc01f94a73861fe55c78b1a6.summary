-- in a rather small survey conducted by a young psychologist , @entity1 was shown to have some interesting correlations with self - esteem and narcissism in young adults			1
in a survey of 100 college students , young people with narcissistic personality traits were shown to exhibit @entity1 activity that was distinctly more self - promotional			1
these people had " @entity12 " sections that referred to their intelligence and photos that were more about displaying the user 's physical attractiveness than about capturing memories with friends			0
narcissism is defined in the survey , by a researcher at @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 , as " a pervasive pattern of grandiosity , need for admiration and an exaggerated sense of self - importance			0
" for the average narcissist , @entity1 " offers a gateway for hundreds of shallow relationships and emotionally detached communication			0
" more importantly for this study , social networking in general allows the user a great deal of control over how he or she is presented to and perceived by peers and other users			0
@entity0 : study says social media is for narcissists the study postulated that narcissists would show more overall @entity1 activity than average users and that their activity would be more self - promotional , either descriptively or superficially			2
the survey 's results showed " significant positive correlations between narcissism and self - promotional content in the following areas : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			2
" people who scored higher on the study 's narcissism test also spent more time on @entity1 and checked it more times each day than their less narcissistic counterparts			1
@entity0 : weekend stories you may have missed male narcissists were more self - promotional in their " @entity12 " descriptions , using this section as an opportunity to highlight their intelligence and wit			1
female users with narcissistic tendencies tended to use images in their self - promotion , uploading content that " include [ d ] revealing , flashy and adorned photos of their physical appearance			1
" @entity0 : older adults nearly double social media presence the researcher notes that this study is intended to be a preliminary look at nonynous social networking , a fairly new field for academic scrutiny			0
as we abandon the fake avatars and cryptic usernames of years past and begin associating our online identities with our real - world lives , our online activities begin to have more relevance to our true personality traits			0
