-- remember that goofy uncle of yours who always tried to impress you by " stealing your nose " or pulling the ol ' separating - his - thumb - from - his - hand move ? well , those parlor tricks are nothing compared to the appendage stunts pulled by these 10 famous people			2
@entity16 's neck bones a painting of @entity18 in his study by @entity20 does n't give a hint at what body part went missing			1
@entity16 might have been a successful assassin , but he was a largely ineffectual escape artist			2
just 12 days after murdering president @entity23 , @entity16 was shot in the back of the neck and killed			0
his body was ( eventually ) buried in an unmarked grave at @entity29 's @entity28			1
his third , fourth , and fifth vertebrae , however , were removed during the autopsy so investigators could access the bullet			0
for a peek at those bits of @entity16 's spinal column , just check out the display at the @entity39 in @entity40 @entity42 's brain before he died , Ã¼ber - genius @entity42 considered donating his body to science			1
unfortunately , he never put his wishes in writing			0
when he passed away in 1955 , @entity42 's family and friends made plans to cremate him , but the pathologist who performed the autopsy , dr. @entity50 , had a different idea			2
instead , he opted to remove the math man 's brain and then tell the family about it			2
for 30 - some years , @entity50 had @entity57 's gray matter tucked away in his @entity59 home in two @entity61 jars			2
naturally , @entity42 's loved ones were n't thrilled when they found out , but they eventually allowed the misappropriated mind to be sliced into 240 sections and disbursed to researchers for examination			2
today , many of the cerebral sections remain in scientific institutions , with the bulk held at @entity71			0
as for @entity42 's body , that was cremated and scattered in a secret location			1
" @entity77 " @entity76 's arm @entity78 general @entity76 got his nickname by sitting astride his horse " like a stone wall " while bullets whizzed around him during the @entity82			1
but that kind of bravery ( or foolhardiness ) did n't serve him well			0
during the @entity87 , @entity76 was accidentally shot in the arm by one of his own men			1
said arm had to be amputated , and afterward , it was buried in the nearby @entity93 town of @entity94			1
only eight days later , @entity77 was stone - cold dead of pneumonia			0
the rest of his body is resting in peace in @entity101 , @entity93			1
@entity103 's hand @entity103 was a saint with a few too many fans			1
in the early 16th century , the @entity106 missionary was sent to @entity107 by the king of @entity109 to convert as many souls to @entity111 as possible			1
turns out , he was pretty good at the job			0
@entity103 became wildly popular , and after his death in 1552 , so did his relics			1
in fact , demand out - fueled supply			0
throughout several years and multiple exhumations , his body was whittled away			2
today , half his left hand is in @entity122 , @entity123 , while the other half is in @entity125 , @entity126			0
one of his arms resides in @entity128 , and various other cities lay claim to his internal organs			0
the leftovers ? they went to @entity134 , @entity123			0
@entity18 's bits and pieces exiled emperor @entity18 died on may 5 , 1821			1
the following day , doctors conducted an autopsy , which was reportedly witnessed by many people , including a priest named @entity141			0
though the body was said to be largely intact at the time of the undertaking , it seems the priest took home a souvenir			2
in 1916 , @entity141 's heirs sold a collection of @entity18 artifacts , including what they claim to be the emperor 's penis			1
while no one knows for sure if it really is @entity18 's , uh , manhood , people have paid good money for the penis			1
currently , it 's in the possession of an @entity163 urologist			1
@entity165 's head @entity165 , the straight - laced @entity166 who usurped the @entity169 throne , was n't exactly a wild man			2
his head , however , was sometimes the life of the party			0
@entity165 died in 1658 , but two years later , the reinstated @entity169 monarchy exhumed , tried , and hanged his body , then dumped it in an unmarked grave			1
in addition , as a warning to would - be killers , his head was placed on a pike in @entity182 , where it remained for 20 years			0
after a subsequent stint in a small museum , it was sold in 1814 to a man named @entity188 ( perhaps looking to parade it around as an exceptionally gruesome ice - breaker at parties )			0
such was the ironic afterlife of the @entity166 until 1960 , when his head was finally laid to rest in a chapel in @entity196			0
