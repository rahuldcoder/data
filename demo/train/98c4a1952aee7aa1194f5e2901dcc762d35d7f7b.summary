-- we all understand that the closer @entity3 gets to an election , the more risk - averse it becomes			1
members just want to get re-elected and are n't looking to take any chances			0
that 's why lame - duck , post-election sessions are sadly often the most productive : once members feel safe ( or are even on their way out of office ) , they can actually do some real work			1
so the aerodynamics of @entity3 as it gets close to an election are this : stop			1
except for this : @entity21 have recently made a fetish of complaining that president @entity23 wo n't let them vote on things			1
he does too much without us , they say			0
they even voted to sue him over his so - called abuse of power			2
" are you willing to let any president choose what laws to execute and what laws to change ? " house speaker @entity38 intoned mightily on the @entity40 floor			0
" are you willing to let anyone tear apart what our founders have built ? " but wait			2
are these the same people who now are , um , ducking a vote on congressional authorization for action against @entity49 ? while @entity38 told @entity0 's @entity50 that while " it would be in the nation 's interest " to " speak " on this question , he said it was up to the president to request it			1
" we 've not gotten that			0
" so , does the @entity40 intend to send something wide - ranging to @entity38 ? not exactly			0
instead there will be a vote to authorize the arming of the @entity64 rebels			0
while the president would " welcome " further congressional action , a senior administration official says , " we believe we have the authority that is necessary " to wage war against @entity49			1
@entity72 : if @entity49 allowed to continue it will be threat to ' homeland ' not that it 's a surprise			1
we all know that in the world in which we live , @entity3 -- with an approval rating of 14 % -- wants to take responsibility for things that are good and avoid responsibility for things that are risky			1
but here 's where each party makes us scratch our heads			0
in the past , republicans have believed -- strongly -- in the thesis that the chief executive has strong unilateral war - making authority			1
( @entity91 went to @entity3 to approve the @entity93 war , but only after much debate and pressure -- and even his vice president opposed the idea			2
) so @entity38 's position has historical precedent			0
except when you consider it in terms of the recent domestic debate : @entity23 ca n't issue a domestic regulation , but he can unilaterally decide to go to war ? huh ? the @entity106 take the exact opposite posture			1
the president can issue strong policy regulations and orders when it comes to health care and the environment , but he should n't act without @entity3 when it comes to war			2
ah , except in this case , because a @entity117 is president			0
and because democrats are worried a vote on the use of force could hurt them with their base in the election , which already looks perilous for their party			2
some unendangered @entity106 have publicly called for a vote , but their leaders are much more sheepish			1
" right now we believe , as the president has stated , that he has the authority he needs , " says @entity129 @entity128			0
for now , at least			0
so case closed ? not quite			0
there are plans this week to vote on the narrower proposition that has bipartisan support : arming the @entity64 rebels			0
but what about the larger issue of voting to authorize war against @entity49 ? yea or nay ? check back -- after the election			1
that 's when politicians vote .			2

@entity146 : in topsy - turvy world of @entity148 , parties doing their best to avoid @entity3 vote on @entity49
republicans suing @entity23 for overuse of authority yet giving him a free pass on *military* action
@entity106 fear a congressional vote 's *impact* on *midterms* , *conflicted* on presidential authority
@entity146 : governing will have to wait until the election is over
