-- when @entity3 basketball player @entity2 moved to @entity4 in 2009 , he was greeted by elaborate graffiti that read " down with the @entity3 " and " @entity3 is the @entity6			1
" similar rhetoric came from the @entity3 , with the government decrying a nuclear weapons program from the country that was part of the " @entity12			0
" it was in this tense political climate that the 6 - foot point guard from the @entity16 accepted a job with the @entity18 after being recruited to carry his team to the playoffs			0
filmmaker @entity21 joined @entity2 on his journey , chronicling the basketball player 's experience in one of the most feared countries in the world in a documentary called " @entity29			1
" although @entity2 had played basketball in several countries around the globe -- including @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 -- he accepted the job in @entity4 with some reluctance			1
" i said to myself , ' well , if i get there and it 's everything like the news said it was , weapons of mass destruction , these people are crazy ... then i 'm just going to get on the next plane and come right back home , ' " @entity2 said			1
yet , what he encountered upon arrival was the unexpected : a team of dedicated basketball players , devoted fans cheering his name , friends with a sense of humor and families that opened their doors and their homes			0
" they love @entity3 ! " @entity2 exclaimed			1
" it was so ironic , because here i was in a country where they have all these signs : ' down with @entity3 ' and ' @entity3 's the @entity6 ' and ' @entity3 's the @entity64			0
' and then with the people , they 're like , ' man ! i love @entity68 ! i love @entity69 ! i love you guys			0
i want to be like you			0
i want to go to @entity3 and be a superstar ! ' " understanding @entity4 : @entity3 athlete reveals his inside story @entity2 became a local star in the cultural center of @entity77 , where he gradually led his low - ranking basketball team to more wins and ultimately to the playoffs			1
and with nothing more than a than a small hdv camera , a wireless mic and an extension cable packed in an unassuming backpack , @entity21 began filming @entity2 's progress " under the radar			1
" without a journalist 's visa and running the risk of imprisonment , the @entity89 - @entity3 filmmaker planned to tell authorities he was a @entity95 tourist filming @entity4 's ancient sites if questioned			1
yet despite the rigid measures , @entity21 saw the opportunity for intercultural dialogue through the charismatic ball player			2
@entity2 , along with 12 other @entity3 basketball players in the country , came under investigation by the @entity104 for technically breaking the trade embargo against @entity4 by accepting a salary			1
the investigation reminded @entity21 of the lack of diplomatic relations between the two nations and the fact the @entity3 had n't had an embassy in @entity4 since the @entity112			1
" it struck me that these players could potentially be bridge - builders , " @entity21 said			2
as an athlete , @entity2 strove to avoid politics and focus on the game but soon learned that politics is the game for nearly every aspect of @entity4 life			1
the women he befriended could be imprisoned for visiting his apartment ; police could stop a car that they suspected carried unmarried women with men ; people who spoke out against the government could be detained without explanation			0
@entity2 found himself literally in the middle of the tense political situation in spring 2009 , when @entity4 took to the streets to protest the results of the presidential election			1
it was the beginning of the country 's @entity138 , when demonstrators claimed a rigged election and demanded the removal of president @entity143			0
@entity2 , in the capital of @entity145 for the playoffs with his team , unwittingly found himself in the heart of the protests			2
" i was getting ready to go to practice , and they had this street , like this long street as far as your eyes could see , " @entity2 explained			2
" on one side was @entity156 , which is like their police , their military police , and the other side were the @entity162 protesters			0
i had to go through the middle of that road , and i was just saying to myself , ' if one of these guys throw a bottle , a stone , shoot a gun , i 'm going to be caught between almost a million people			0
' that 's when i said , ' man , this thing right here ai n't no basketball ; this thing right here is starting to get serious			0
' " although the protests were quickly quelled by the government , @entity4 's @entity138 was the prelude to the @entity181 , laying the groundwork for subsequent uprisings across the @entity184 and even the @entity3 ' @entity186 movement			2
" it 's important to remember that all of these uprisings in the countries that we now associate with the @entity181 , all of these uprisings were initiated by the @entity138 in @entity4 , " @entity21 said			1
" so it 's ironic that @entity4 , of all places , has n't quite gotten there yet			2
... i really hope at some point in history , we 'll remember the @entity4 people as the ones who got things going			2
" @entity21 is determined to record that piece of @entity4 history , and as the revolutionaries go online to mobilize support , the filmmaker likewise utilizes the @entity207 to spread their story			1
along with his co-producer and wife , @entity210 , @entity21 launched one of the most successful @entity213 campaigns in the fundraising site 's history , raising $ 100,466 for the production of " @entity29			2
" another campaign is under way to fund distribution of the film			0
" when you get so much support from every corner of the world , you literally feel the love , " @entity21 said			0
" it 's a combination of basketball fans , people interested in bettering relationships between the two religions , between the two cultures , and a lot of people coming together and entering this big tent that we 're trying to create			0
" the ultimate goal of the documentary for @entity21 and @entity2 is intercultural dialogue			1
both hope that a clearer understanding of the @entity242 world in the @entity243 will lead to more informed policy decisions and will foster support for the ordinary people who are fighting to realize democracy			0
" this story here needs to be told because we 're grouping @entity4 with the government and not the people , " @entity2 said			1
" we 're not understanding that the people wanted an opportunity to change the government			0
