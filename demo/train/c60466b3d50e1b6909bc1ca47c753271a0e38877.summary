@entity1 investigators have evidence that hackers stole the computer credentials of a system administrator to get access to @entity9 's computer system , allowing them broad access , @entity1 officials briefed on the investigation tell @entity12			1
the finding is one reason why @entity1 investigators do not believe the attack on @entity9 was aided by someone on the inside , the officials tell @entity12			1
the revelation is part of what is behind the government 's conclusion that hackers operating on behalf of @entity24 were responsible			2
the government is expected to publicly blame the reclusive regime as early as friday			0
the hackers ability to gain access to the passwords of a top - level information technology employee allowed them to have " keys to the entire building , " one official said			1
@entity35 outraged over @entity9 decision the access has led to some suspicion of perhaps an inside job			2
it 's a common tactic that hackers use , and cyber-attacks often look like inside jobs , the officials say			0
@entity1 used signal intelligence and other means to trace the attack to @entity24 , finding digital footprints that pointed to @entity48 € ‹ the statement to be issued as early as friday morning will provide some of the evidence behind the @entity1 government 's conclusion , but not all			1
though officials say they are planning to lay blame on friday , they have n't yet decided how to respond to the attack			0
the @entity57 and other agencies are holding a series of high - level meetings to discuss the @entity1 ' range of options , a senior official in president @entity65 's administration said			1
" we do think it 's appropriate to respond , " the official said			0
those options could include new sanctions against @entity24 , another source said			2
@entity57 press secretary @entity72 would n't confirm that the @entity65 administration has pinned the hack on @entity24 , saying it 's still being investigated by the @entity75 and the @entity76			1
he said the investigation is " being treated as a serious national security matter			0
" " there is evidence to indicate that we have seen destructive activity with malicious intent that was initiated by a sophisticated actor , " @entity72 said			0
he said the @entity1 ' response would need to be " proportional , " and that national security officials considering how to respond are " also mindful of the fact that sophisticated actors when they carry out actions like this are oftentimes , not always , but often seeking to provoke a response from the @entity1			2
" opinion : @entity96 's complete moral surrender a senior administration official said the @entity57 did not pressure @entity9 to make the decision it announced wednesday to pull the movie " @entity100 " -- which depicts the assassination of @entity24 leader @entity102 -- from theaters			1
" there was no pressure			0
absolutely not , " the official said , adding that consultations with @entity9 happened primarily in phone calls between the company and the @entity75 which were relayed to the @entity57			2
for all the restrictions the @entity1 has already placed on @entity24 , administration officials say there 's a lot further those penalties could go			1
the toughest option : the @entity1 could restrict @entity24 's dollar - denominated trade by hitting @entity118 banks that do business with @entity120 -- a tactic used against @entity122 and , less comprehensively , against @entity123 after its incursion into @entity126 's @entity125			1
other economic sanctions could also be considered , and the @entity1 could finger @entity24 individuals involved in the hack for criminal charges -- though that option , while still being considered , appears unlikely , an administration official said			1
" at this point we are not prepared to official say who we believe was behind this attack , " @entity133 @entity132 told @entity134 on thursday			0
" i will say this : we do regard the attack on @entity9 as very serious			2
" defector : @entity24 deep into cyber warfare @entity132 described it as a " serious attack not only on individuals and a company but basic freedoms we enjoy in this country , " but did not want to label it terrorism			0
the administration is still discussing how to characterize the hack , sources said			0
sources say it 's unlikely there will be an indictment right now , as was the case in the @entity118 military hacking case early this year			0
one law enforcement source said " in order to indict you have to have an idea of who the players are , " and at this point the investigation has n't yet revealed those details			0
the law enforcement source said the @entity1 ' cyber investigation is moving at a speed that 's unheard of amid mounting pressure for the @entity1 government to publicly point the finger at @entity24			1
analyst : we underestimated @entity24 the source said the @entity9 hack was similar to a cyber attack against @entity182 banks last year , and that the coding was in @entity24			1
a source familiar with the investigation says " the tactics , techniques and procedures were right out of the @entity24 playbook			0
" sources with first - hand knowledge of the investigation said officials have n't ruled out the possibility that a @entity9 insider or former employee aided in the attack .			2
