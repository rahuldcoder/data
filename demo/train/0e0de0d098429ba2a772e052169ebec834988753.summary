-- a grand prix in austerity - hit @entity2 could be on the horizon according to @entity6 boss @entity5			1
on may 30 , @entity5 's company @entity7 registered the ' @entity8 ' as a trademark			1
" the @entity2 are keen , " @entity5 told @entity0			1
" they want me to go and see the prime minister or the mayor , " added @entity5 , referring to @entity10 and @entity11 respectively			2
" we will have to find out if they have got any money			0
" total investment of around $ 1 billion is required to build a track from scratch and cover the @entity6 hosting fee , which typically runs for 10 years			2
private investors are looking at the construction of a track in the @entity26 , which is six miles to the west of @entity28			0
it would be hard for @entity2 to justify a publicly funded investment after receiving more than â ‚ ¬ 150 billion in bailouts following the recent recession , with unemployment still above 27 percent -- the highest in eurozone			2
" @entity2 has experienced , and still is in the middle of , a massive crisis , but is now on the verge of stabilization and turning things around very slowly , " said @entity2 's leading @entity6 journalist @entity35			1
" priorities must be set on where government funding will go and i 'm pretty sure that an @entity6 race is not on the priority list on that level			1
" we should , however , point out that private initiatives are looking at the possibility of funding the construction of a street circuit in the area of @entity53 and the hosting of a race			0
" the plans have been laid , financial studies have been completed , and the project has been presented to interested parties for financing			0
" the @entity2 prime minister @entity10 sent a letter to the mayor of @entity53 , by which he provided his full support to this attempt and that is based on private funding			0
" legacy @entity69 -- track architect for the prospective race promoter @entity71 -- says that " the prime minister himself has supported fully the initiative for organizing @entity6 races and is looking forward to the instruction from the relevant international federations to realize the @entity79 project			1
" the greatest benefit for our country would be giving to the world the opportunity to see the most historical port of the @entity86 , " added @entity69			0
" and our experience at organizing big events , such as the @entity89 , is a big credential for us			0
" while the @entity93 in @entity2 were a tremendous success , their legacy has been far from medal - winning and images of the neglected sites recently hit the headlines on the event 's 10 - year anniversary			2
settlement the bailouts for @entity2 came from the @entity103 and the @entity104 in which @entity105 has the largest single stake			0
@entity5 himself was recently a big contributor to @entity105 's economy through paying the largest legal settlement in the country 's history			0
he paid the state of @entity114 $ 100 million to settle charges , which he denied , that he had paid a $ 44 million bribe to steer the sale of @entity6 in 2006 to his preferred bidder , the private equity firm @entity120			0
@entity5 has remained in @entity6 's driving seat and recently returned to work at the @entity122 @entity8 after the conclusion of the court case			1
registering a pan-european trademark for the title ' @entity127 ' is a key step in the process of bringing the race to the @entity6 calendar			1
wherever possible , @entity7 licensing registers trademarks for the names of upcoming races and prior to the @entity127 it protected the title to the @entity136 @entity8 which returned to the @entity6 calendar in june			1
changing times a @entity127 in @entity2 was first rumored in 2006 by @entity138 when it was suggested that the race could be rotated between a number of circuits , starting with @entity142 in 2008 and then @entity143 in @entity144 the year after			1
last month @entity6 announced that the @entity145 will return to the calendar next year after a 23 - year absence and a new race in @entity149 , capital of the oil - rich country of @entity152 , will take place in 2016			1
this year 's new addition is a @entity8 in @entity155 on a track which snakes around the park used for the @entity158 in @entity159			1
it 's the product of a partnership between @entity5 and his personal friend @entity155 president @entity162			1
" @entity155 is definitely going ahead , " said @entity164			0
" @entity162 has given it 100 % support			0
he is easy to deal with			0
" he is a guy that if he says ' good morning ' you can guarantee that it is before @entity174			0
he wants to get the race done and he will get it done , " added @entity5			2
support @entity162 's resounding show of support comes against a backdrop of calls from @entity183 politicians for the cancellation of the race which is due to take place on october 12			0
conservative mp @entity187 , recently said that the " morally proper " thing for @entity6 to do is to put the race on hold in light of @entity193 's alleged support for @entity195 rebels in @entity196 who have been accused of shooting down @entity197 17			2
@entity183 's deputy prime minister @entity198 has also questioned whether @entity155 is fit to host either the @entity8 or the 2018 @entity199 " the question marks i 'm raising will only increase over the next coming weeks and months , over the summer and up to the @entity8 , " said @entity198			1
the only @entity6 race to have been canceled in the past 20 years is the @entity202 which was dropped due to a civil uprising in the country .			2

@entity6 could introduce a grand prix race in @entity2
' @entity208 ' registered as trademark
@entity6 *supremo* @entity5 says @entity2 " are keen "
@entity5 confirms all *systems* go for @entity155 @entity8 in @entity159 later this year
