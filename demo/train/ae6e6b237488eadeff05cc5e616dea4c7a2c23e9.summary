-- an @entity3 sheriff 's deputy who said he was shot by a suspected drug trafficker in the desert has been fired following an investigation into comments he made to a @entity9 newspaper and investigators , the department said wednesday			1
@entity12 , who was previously suspended , will appeal his termination , the @entity11 said in a statement			1
ten allegations were sustained during an internal probe , including incompetence , improper conduct , and violations of truthfulness and the code of ethics , according to the statement			2
sheriff @entity24 cited comments @entity12 made to reporter @entity26 of the @entity27 , which challenged @entity12 's version of the april 30 shooting incident			1
" i stood by my deputy after he was shot by drug smugglers in april because his statements to both criminal and internal investigators were consistent , supported by physical evidence , radio transmissions , gps coordinates , other victims / witnesses and later through gunshot residue testing conducted on the shirt he was wearing , " @entity24 said in the statement			1
" the manner in which deputy @entity12 conducted himself following the shooting investigation when interviewed by reporter @entity26 brought great discredit to himself and the men and women representing our sworn law enforcement profession			1
" the department released no other details of the investigation			0
@entity12 told the newspaper that representatives of " the @entity57 cartel " have approached him four or five times over the years wanting to do business and asking him to look the other way			1
@entity12 told the newspaper he did n't arrest any of these men , call for backup , or write reports about the encounters , the @entity27 reported			2
@entity12 was also investigated for allegedly telling the reporter " you 're lucky to be alive right now " and that he knew a rancher who offered to murder the reporter after his initial article challenged @entity12 's account of his wounding , sheriff 's office spokesman @entity65 said in early december			1
in october , authorities said @entity12 was telling the truth about how he was wounded			2
they presented evidence from a follow - up investigation provoked by a media report that challenged the deputy 's version of events			2
" many have suggested a conspiracy , ( that ) somehow our deputy shot himself , " @entity24 said at a press conference october 7			0
" people weighed in that were n't from @entity3 ... and it put that question of doubt in the public 's mind that there 's something here to look at			0
" in september , @entity27 cited forensic experts who challenged the account from @entity12 , who said he was shot in the central @entity3 desert from a distance by an illegal immigrant with an @entity103			2
two experts were quoted by the @entity27 as saying the evidence suggested @entity12 had been shot at very close range			2
the @entity11 said in october that new testing on the bullet - torn shirt @entity12 was wearing on the day of the shooting had ruled out a close - range shot			1
" the physical evidence , radio traffic , phone calls and now this gunshot residue testing completed by the @entity118 all confirm ( @entity12 's ) account of the events , " the sheriff 's office said in a statement			1
the @entity27 allegations provoked the sheriff 's office to reopen its investigation into the case " to maintain transparency , " according to the sheriff 's office , and " to prove without question that the weapon fired at @entity129 was not a ' contact wound			1
' " the office said last year that @entity12 's shirt from the day of the incident was tested by the @entity118 for " the presence of munitions residue , indicative of a close contact discharge			1
" " this testing further confirms that the gunshot wound was not a close contact shot as had been reported by the two doctors through a local media entity , " the statement said , referring to @entity27			0
asked at an october press conference if he was anxious about how the tests would come back , @entity12 said no. " i did not need any test -- i was there , " he said			0
" i did not shoot myself			0
" on april 30 , @entity12 contacted authorities after being wounded in the desert , lt. @entity147 , a sheriff 's spokeswoman , said at the time			1
the deputy radioed that he had encountered five men , some wielding long guns and handguns , and said they were carrying a large amount of marijuana			0

video from the scene showed that the deputy was located while sitting in desert brush , surrounded by cactus			0
he was able to walk to a helicopter , which airlifted him to a hospital			0
