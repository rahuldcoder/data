@entity0 -- if all the recent wrangling over the fiscal cliff has revealed anything , it 's how tense and strained president @entity7 's relationship is with @entity8 in @entity9			1
@entity10 : fiscal cliff was bound to collapse and @entity7 's relationship with @entity9 reached yet another low thursday when @entity14 speaker @entity13 confirmed to @entity1 that he has told @entity15 he will no longer negotiate legislative deals with the president			1
and in an opinion piece on thursday , sen. @entity18 of @entity19 faulted the president for all the fiscal brinksmanship since 2010			0
the new no. 2 @entity23 also suggested that " [ i ] t may be necessary to partially shut down the government in order to secure the long - term fiscal well being of our country			0
" low bar for new @entity9 in the @entity14 's relationship with @entity41 , " the real negative is clearly that the relationship with @entity15 is as bad as ever , " @entity1 contributor and @entity34 historian @entity32 said , adding that the @entity14 @entity35 refuses to acknowledge any mandate from @entity7 after november 's election			1
" they are going to fight the president tooth and nail , " @entity32 said , a problem made worse by the fact that @entity13 " is not in control " of @entity15 , particularly the contingent of fiscal conservatives brought to @entity0 by support from the tea party movement			1
@entity32 : @entity35 faces choice -- leadership or gridlock ? @entity1 contributor @entity55 said @entity7 's strained relationship with congressional @entity8 dates back to the contentious debate over @entity7 's signature health care legislation , where the president showed his willingness to push through major proposals and major legislation without consulting them			1
" he is so good at the business of politics that he 's really outmaneuvered them , " @entity55 observed about @entity7 's relationship with @entity8 over the past four years			1
@entity55 : the real issue is runaway spending the already difficult relationship is n't helped by unique issues on each side			0
the @entity35 has been struggling to define itself and its message in tough economic times amidst twin concerns about government spending and income inequality			0
@entity32 : what the tea party cost the @entity35 and buoyed by his electoral success in 2008 , legislative successes in the first half of his first term and by winning a second term , @entity7 adopted a take - it - or - leave - it attitude with @entity8 , even as the nation teetered on the edge of the fiscal cliff			1
" my preference would have been to solve these problems in the context of a larger agreement , a bigger deal , a grand bargain			0
but with this @entity9 , that was obviously a little too much to hope for at this time , " @entity7 said monday afternoon at a @entity14 event that at moments seemed like a campaign gathering			2
at the same event , @entity7 also warned the @entity35 about expected battles over spending cuts in the coming months			1
" now , if @entity8 think that i will finish the job of deficit reduction through spending cuts alone , " @entity7 said , " [ @entity109 ] f they think that 's going to be the formula for how we solve this thing , then they 've got another thing coming			0
that 's not how it 's going to work			0
" rather , @entity7 declared " it 's going to have to be a matter of shared sacrifice , at least as long as i 'm president			2
and i 'm going to be president for the next four years			0
" @entity7 's recent post-election trash talking directed at @entity9 is " defiance politics " that misunderstands what it means to win an election , @entity55 said			1
the president 's recent comments are like " an end zone dance , a celebration " or , in the world of mixed martial arts competition , like " putting your foot on the other guy 's neck and holding your hand up in the air , " after you 've felled your opponent , according to @entity55			2
instead of taking every opportunity to remind republicans that he won ( and they lost ) last november , @entity7 needs to realize that " with winning elections comes the responsibility to lead , " @entity55 said			1
as the person in whom the public has placed its trust and confidence , " your burdens are much greater ( than your losing opponent 's )			0
" @entity152 counter that @entity7 has n't had anyone to make a deal with			0
" when @entity13 comes to the table and he ca n't even bring his deputy or his third in command to vote for the deal that he is agreeing to , i think you 've got a real crisis of leadership in the @entity14 , " former @entity14 press secretary @entity155 said			1
debt ceiling : welcome to @entity164 " and so the president showed that even in that case , he can get a deal that moves the ball forward for the country , but going forward , you just wonder , how much control does @entity13 have over the folks in the @entity14 and what kind of deals are we going to be able to get ? " for all his recent public swagger when it comes to @entity9 , @entity7 " really does compromise a lot , " said @entity32			1
for example , @entity32 pointed out that during recent negotiations over the fiscal cliff , the president changed his position substantially on the income threshold for eliminating the @entity186 tax cuts			0
while he says he does n't think there 's much more @entity7 can do publicly to smooth over the differences with @entity15 , @entity32 said that @entity7 ca n't let stand @entity13 's declaration that he 's abandoning any more legislative deal - making with the @entity14			1
the president would be wise to try to work behind the scenes to keep @entity13 " in the fold and maintain some sort of relationship " with the speaker			2
and @entity32 noted an encouraging pattern in the recent fiscal brinksmanship between @entity9 and the president			0
after negotiations between @entity13 and @entity7 broke down , " ( @entity207 stepped up and put the deal together , " observed @entity32 , who added the @entity23 could take the lead again in working out agreements on things like handling automatic spending cuts put off by this week 's fiscal cliff deal and likely upcoming battles over the debt ceiling and funding the federal government			1
@entity32 noted that after @entity210 negotiated a deal with vice president @entity212 , @entity13 allowed @entity14 @entity8 to entertain an alternative that would have included more spending cuts , an alternative which never made it to a vote because fiscal conservatives could n't muster a majority in the @entity35 to support its passage			1
ultimately , @entity13 kept his pledge to @entity152 leaders in @entity9 to put the @entity23 's deal up for a @entity14 vote			1
by making the pledge before the terms of the @entity23 deal were even set , @entity32 said , @entity13 sent a signal to @entity15 that they were going to lose the battle over the fiscal cliff even if they did n't like the @entity23 deal			1
the maneuvers by @entity210 and @entity13 suggest a path forward if repeated , according to @entity32 , because if @entity35 leaders continue not to obstruct @entity152 as they try to move forward with legislation , that could help bring around tea party @entity8 in the @entity14			1
tea party calls for consequences after fiscal cliff vote in order to improve their relationship with the @entity14 , @entity240 said @entity8 " have to fix what 's broken in their own party , they have to heal the divisions in their own party			0
and define what the @entity35 is about			0
" @entity13 re-elected speaker in midst of public defections calling it " a miracle " that @entity13 was re-elected as speaker , @entity240 said the @entity35 must also decide which role it wants to play in @entity7 's second term			1
will they try to be accommodating and try to work with the president to find solutions to problems , including some problems @entity23 donors and the @entity23 establishment wants fixed ? or will they play the proverbial loyal opposition ? both are " not terribly attractive options " for the @entity35 , @entity240 said , especially up against a masterful political strategist like @entity7			2
and @entity55 suggests that the sports - loving and competitive @entity7 invite top @entity8 over to the @entity14 for his annual @entity271 watching party in order to build personal relationships across the aisle in @entity9			1
for @entity7 , moderating his triumphal , defiant approach when it comes to @entity8 and @entity9 is also important because , @entity240 points out , gun control and immigration reform are both high on @entity7 's second term agenda			1
and there are strong feelings on the part of conservatives and @entity7 's liberal base on both issues			2
politics in 2013 : 5 things to watch for @entity7 talks about ' worst day of my presidency , ' goals for next term on the fiscal issues where @entity7 has repeatedly clashed with @entity294 in the past two years , @entity32 warns that recent events could repeat themselves			2
" it 's going to be rough , going to be tough , we 're going to see this issue recur again and again over the years , " the historian said			0
indeed , both @entity7 and @entity210 , the @entity35 's new lead fiscal negotiator , already seem to be playing out a familiar script			1
3 more fiscal cliffs loom the last fiscal battle barely over , @entity7 wasted no time late tuesday night staking out his position in the battles to come			0
after saying " i am very open to compromise , " the president went on to fire a shot over @entity9 ' bow in the likely fight in february over raising the debt ceiling			0
" [ @entity313 ] hile i will negotiate over many things , i will not have another debate with this @entity9 over whether or not they should pay the bills that they 've already racked up through the laws that they passed , " @entity7 declared , " let me repeat : we ca n't not pay bills that we 've already incurred			2
" @entity210 quickly fired back			0
" the president may not want to have a fight about government spending over the next few months , but it 's the fight he is going to have , because it 's a debate the country needs , " @entity210 wrote in a @entity321 op - ed published wednesday night , adding that @entity7 " must show up " and deliver a serious plan for slashing federal spending			2
" that 's the debate the @entity332 people really want			0
it 's a debate @entity8 are ready to have			0
and it 's the debate that starts today , whether the president wants it or not , " @entity210 wrote			0
although he has sworn off direct negotiations with @entity7 , @entity13 echoed @entity210 's remarks on friday			2
" with the cliff behind us , the focus turns to spending , " @entity13 told @entity14 republicans			2
@entity1 's @entity343 , @entity344 , @entity345 , @entity346 , @entity347 , @entity348 , @entity349 , @entity350 , @entity351 , @entity352 and @entity354 's @entity353 contributed to this report .			0

house speaker @entity13 says he wo n't negotiate legislation with the president
@entity32 : @entity14 @entity35 wo n't acknowledge @entity7 's mandate , @entity13 not in control of caucus
@entity55 : @entity7 needs to stop practicing " defiance politics , " needs to lead
