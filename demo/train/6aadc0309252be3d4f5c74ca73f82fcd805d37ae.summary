-- @entity1 is a small town in southwest @entity3 , with about 26,000 people and an enviable unemployment rate of just 2.8 %			1
but barely 20 miles away , across the @entity8 border , the picture is very different			1
the @entity10 town of @entity11 has a similar industrial base , but an unemployment rate of 7.4 %			1
among young people , the contrast is even starker , with 23 % of under - 25s unemployed in the @entity8 town , compared to 1.8 % in @entity18			1
the differing fortunes of these neighboring border towns illustrate the complaints of many @entity8 businesses , as their country heads towards a presidential election			1
@entity25 is the president of @entity26 , a family - run business which has operated since the 1930s , and has one of the largest worktop production lines in @entity32			0
despite a commitment to invest in @entity35 , she worries about the increased costs of running a firm in @entity8 , saying taxes are higher , labor is twice as expensive , and workers ' benefits are double those paid in @entity3			1
@entity25 says she is concerned the next @entity8 government will tax companies like hers out of business			1
" we are afraid money will be taken from our companies , and afraid that taxes will increase a lot and the situation will become bad for companies our size , " she says			0
further , she says , the " relationship between the unions is more constructive and easier in @entity3			0
" across the border is the workplace of @entity57 , a @entity8 who lives in his homeland but commutes to work in @entity18			1
@entity57 , the sales manager for plastics industry solutions provider @entity59 , believes a @entity3 focus on the long - term is behind the current success			2
" in @entity3 , for sure , we are thinking of the long - term			2
in a company like this , [ there 's a ] huge focus on training and the future of our employees , " he says			0
" the approach in @entity3 to keep workers in times of low - load level means we were ready when the economy restarted			2
" the trade - off for @entity3 workers is less job security , no national , fixed minimum wage , and less extensive social protections for the unemployed			2
but the mayor of @entity11 , @entity83 , says it is time for @entity8 to make these changes to regain its economic competitiveness			0
" as soon as the next president is in office -- be it the one we 've got or a new one -- i sincerely hope that jobs reforms will be put in place immediately , " he says			0
" the system needs to be more flexible			0
there is a lot that must change , starting with the mindset of employers and employees			0

two towns either side of the @entity8 - @entity3 border have contrasting economic fortunes
@entity35 has 7.4 % unemployment , compared with 2.8 % in @entity3 @entity18
@entity8 businesses say they envy the lower tax and labor costs across the border
they fear the burden on @entity8 business will increase after the *forthcoming* election
