-- @entity1 will be reunited with his former caddy at next week 's @entity3 after the world 's top three golfers were paired together in the opening two rounds in @entity8			1
the dream trio of @entity1 , @entity11 and @entity12 winner @entity12 will tee off from the first hole at the @entity14 on thursday at 1:14 p.m. local time and then at 7:44 a.m. on the 11th hole on friday , the @entity9 said			1

" woods split with his caddy , @entity22 , in 2011 in a move that left the @entity24 in " shock			0
" @entity22 was beside @entity1 for 13 of his 14 major titles but now works with @entity12			1
@entity22 later in 2011 apologized for making a racist remark aimed at @entity1 and this year reportedly said @entity21 should have been disqualified for an illegal drop at the masters			2
