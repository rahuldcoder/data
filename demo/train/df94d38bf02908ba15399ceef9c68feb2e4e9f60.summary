yes , it 's happening again			0
" according to @entity37 , @entity26 explained that day in a text to her that he 'd set his " computer to alert ( him ) if anyone is in ( the room ) when i 'm not there			1
" specifically , @entity26 wrote that it " checks " his bed			2

" that " viewing party " never happened , @entity26 wrote in a subsequent text exchange			1

@entity26 's lawyer , @entity83 , meanwhile , introduced a message sent the next day in which his client told @entity37 that his roommate had committed suicide and described it as " crazy			1

" last week , @entity4 graduate @entity94 testified that @entity26 had told him after an ultimate frisbee practice that he set up the webcam and was planning to do it again the evening of september 21			2
yet previously , @entity83 has argued that his client had switched on the webcam to monitor his personal items because he did not trust his roommate 's visitor , not necessarily because @entity19 was gay			1
and amid testimony monday by detective @entity104 of the @entity105 , the defense lawyer noted that @entity26 cooperated fully when investigators talked with him for the first time after @entity19 's death			1

the charges will be dropped if she does all of those things			0
testifying last week , @entity141 said she was surprised to learn that @entity26 had talked and taken to @entity31 to hype the webcam scheme and to essentially advertise that others could watch an upcoming liaison			2
