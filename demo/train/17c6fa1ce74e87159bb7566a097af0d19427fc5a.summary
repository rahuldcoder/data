@entity0 -- @entity2 founded the music - streaming service @entity4 in his native @entity5 in 2006 and launched it to the public two years later			1
the service now has more than 10 million users in 12 countries			1
it launched in the @entity10 in july and recently announced a platform for third - party apps , allowing outside developers to build new social features into the service			1
@entity2 is one of the speakers at @entity17 , one of @entity20 's largest tech conferences			1
he spoke to @entity1 ahead of his talk friday			1
the following is an edited version of that interview : @entity1 : you recently announced you were opening up @entity4 to outside developers			1
are you hoping that @entity4 will become an online music hangout ? @entity2 : yes			1
look , the way we think about it is that there are 500 million people right now that listen to music online , and out of those 500 million the vast majority of people listen illegally			1
we just feel that what is missing right now is sort of music across the @entity38			2
the other thing we realized is that music is something that is deeply personal to people and curating that experience is definitely a personal experience			1
we felt that there were so many places around the web where people were doing a good job curating music , but you could n't actually hear it			1
so we felt that what we added to the table was really powering music to all these great experiences			2
@entity1 : so what other mid- to long - term plans do you have for @entity4 ? where do you see it in five , maybe 10 years ? ek : we kind of look at music as something very natural in people 's lives			1
i mean , most of us can relate to music in some sort of shape and form , and if you think about it , most of us remember the first time we kissed someone , what kind of music was playing or the song that was playing on our friend 's birthday			2
we believe that music should be like water			1
it should just exist everywhere so if you think about that for a moment			2
what we are really trying to do ( is ) making music more accessible			0
we want music to be everywhere and in every device , in every place			0
it really does n't matter where in the world that is or on what device that is or what i 'm doing			0
i should always have music accessible			0
@entity1 : how do you think the @entity103 integration is working out ? you can see users ' @entity4 choices showing up next to their updates			1
how is that working out ? ek : the most important thing in converting people from pirate users to legal users has been to get them to engage more in music			1
and @entity103 really helps us with that			0
we find that our users who are social share a lot more playlists with their friends , and that also means that they are discovering a lot more music , and the more music they are discovering the better it is because they keep coming back to @entity4			1
but they are also a lot more likely to pay , so i would say that we are incredibly aligned with @entity103 in that we want people to engage more			0
and so far it has been a great partnership			0
@entity1 : has there been any privacy backlash over that sharing ? ek : the way i look at this is every time @entity103 has done something historically there has always been a great debate about privacy			1
but what normally happens is after a few weeks everyone kind of says , " ok , well , actually this is pretty cool and this is what i wanted			0
" we take people 's privacy very , very seriously			0
shortly after releasing the first clients , we had a lot of users that said , " hey , i want the opportunity to turn this off at different times , " and what was so interesting about that process was that we asked our community			1
i was actually tweeting with our users , and they were the ones that suggested to us that we add this private listening mode that we now have			0
so our users suggested that and were very specific with " this is how we think it should work " and we took that very seriously and implemented it within 48 hours			0
@entity1 : do you see yourself on a crusade to save the music industry ? ek : i do n't think we see ourselves as the savior of the music industry			1
we are passionate about making it so that users enjoy the music that they want to enjoy but at the same time fairly compensates artists			2
that 's not the same as saving the music industry			0
@entity1 : how much support do you receive from the record labels in your quest to do that ? ek : again , this has been a big change			2
not for us , but for the entire music industry			0
music has moved from being about ownership to being about access , and i think that any major change and a disruption in an industry takes time			0
but we have great relationships with all of our label partners			0
and we feel that we are going from strength to strength , and i think our user numbers are showing that but also the fact that we have now , in a very short period of time , become the second - largest income stream for all the music industry in @entity20 in just shy of three years			2
@entity1 : what kind of feedback have you personally gotten from musicians that you 've met ? ek : a lot of them are real excited			2
they just want to know how they can market themselves better with @entity4			2
they want to figure out , " how do i get as many people as possible to hear my music ? " and the interesting thing with @entity4 is that it is entirely democratic because we do n't promote a single artist or do anything else			1
actually , the only thing we have here is we have apps now that help curate			0
@entity4 itself does nothing to promote a particular type of music			1
thereby , my advice to artists is very simple : " make the best music you can and people will share it			2
" it 's really that simple			0
@entity1 : and what about you yourself ? how do you consume music ? ek : it 's actually funny because i have two -- i probably should n't even admit this -- but i have two listening modes			1
one is obviously @entity4 , but i 've started becoming a bit of a vinyl buff so i actually listen to vinyl			2
there is something warm , and i just really enjoy vinyl			0
so i tend to buy a lot of vinyl records			0
i like it for the artwork but also for the warmness in sound			0
@entity1 : what kind of music ? what are your music preferences ? ek : i listen to jazz , pop , rock , r&b			1
it really does n't matter to me			0
so it 's often easier to talk about specific artists that i listen to right now			0
and right now i listen to an @entity265 artist called @entity266 , which i know is pretty odd , but i discovered here through some @entity265 who was living in @entity270 and listening to @entity4 and thereafter i have fallen in love with her			2
there is a pretty cool cover of the @entity276 song " @entity277			0
