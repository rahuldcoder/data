-- amid the rubble , you see a child 's toy , clothing , furniture , family photographs			2
homes that once sheltered families now ripped open , their insides spilling out like intestines			0
these haunting images were captured in @entity13 in june by @entity15 photographer @entity14			1
while many photographers concentrate on the faces of @entity19 's brutal conflict , @entity14 saw another side : what happens when a person 's private space becomes ripped open by war			1
" you see such scenes , and you imagine the moment when people had to escape from the rooms , " he said			1
" i imagine the people who must run away -- or die			0
" @entity14 had visited several camps on both sides of the @entity19 - @entity35 border in early 2013			1
thanks to a friend in the city keeping him up to date with events , he decided in june to head to the @entity19 city of @entity13 , which has been ravaged in fighting between government and rebel fighters			1
@entity19 take steps toward healing after organizing a car ride with a man from the @entity48 , the main opposition rebel force , he crossed the border from @entity35			1
many journalists choose to enter with the rebels for better access and less censorship than with the @entity19 government , he said			1
the trip to @entity13 involved nerve - jangling encounters with armed checkpoints and constant fear of discovery			2
just carrying a camera was dangerous , he said , particularly since the abduction of several foreign journalists in the country			0
" there are many independent armed gangs , and they could stop you , rob you , kidnap you and in the worst case , kill you			0
" when he arrived in @entity13 and began to work , photographing and interviewing @entity48 fighters and local residents , he saw much of the city 's precious historical monuments damaged or destroyed and neighborhoods smashed to pieces			1
at one point , while he was interviewing a local rebel commander , a mortar wheeled overhead , slamming into two fighters less than 100 meters from him			0
and strange , as it felt like i was not there , maybe because of the camera creating distance , just working inside my ( camera ) viewer , " he said			0
" in truth , of course , you are very much there , and you 're risking your life			0
" after a few days , @entity14 began documenting the devastation through a series of evocative images of abandoned and destroyed homes that had been attacked over the course of the conflict			1
almost all the people he met over the course of his visit had lost part or all of their homes			0
" it 's something like still - life photography , but you can see inside the homes tensions and fear , the moments of violence , how you were obligated to leave your things , your home , your life and go away , maybe to not come back			2
" nearly 700 killed in @entity19 rebel infighting it was dangerous work			2
many of the buildings are now lookout points for the @entity48 and targeted by government attacks			0
he often found himself sprinting with rebel fighters from one building to the next			0
" i was walking through buildings and taking pictures very fast , " he said			1
" but i tried to do it in an artistic way			0
" now back in @entity15 , he feels that the images of abandoned buildings show how the calm of everyday home life can suddenly , terribly , be shattered forever			1
" it is a way to sensitize people to the war , " he said of his images			2
" i think my testimony could be a little piece more to help the @entity19			2
a very tiny piece of help			0
