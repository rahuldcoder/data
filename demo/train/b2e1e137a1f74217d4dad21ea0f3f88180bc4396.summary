-- a young black man runs with the ball at his feet , living out his dream of playing on the world stage			2
around him , amidst an intimidating , vicious atmosphere , the noises begin			2
first , the boos , then the monkey noises			2
the incessant chanting , the vitriolic abuse , the gestures and then , the indignity of receiving punishment for having the temerity to stand your ground			0
welcome to @entity19 2012 , or should that be @entity20 1909 ? racism row shines light on @entity19 football at first glance , @entity24 , an officer in the @entity25 during the @entity26 and @entity28 footballer @entity27 appear to have little in common			1
@entity30 is a successful @entity31 footballer , at the start of a promising career , which he hopes will see him become a full international			0
before he was killed in the @entity26 , @entity24 was a pioneering black footballer , who blazed a trail for black stars of the future such as @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			1
one man is on our television screen with pictures being sent around the world , the other has no grave , only an inscription on the memorial wall at the @entity54 - @entity53 war cemetery and memorial at @entity56			0
black pioneer but @entity24 's story , recorded some 93 years ago , could not be more apt given what @entity30 was forced to endure in @entity59			1
while most were left stunned by @entity30 being sent off for his reaction to being targeted by racist chanting , the tale is all too familiar for those who know their history			0
@entity24 became the first black outfield player to to compete in the top - flight of the @entity69 league after signing for @entity70 in 1909			1
like @entity30 , he too suffered racial abuse from the stands with his career almost disappearing from history and public consciousness			0
@entity76 hit by @entity78 racism fine that it did n't is largely thanks to two men , writer and producer @entity82 and director @entity83 , who are taking @entity84 's story to the stage and eventually the big screen			0
while the film surrounding @entity24 's life is scheduled to coincide with 2014 's 100th anniversary of the @entity26 , the play will open in february in @entity91			1
" i think the play will be very topical , " said @entity82 , author of the biography @entity24 , 1888 - 1918 : officer , @entity94			1
" it 's quite poignant that the play should start so soon given what happened to @entity30 in @entity19			0
" what happened to @entity30 , happened to @entity24 around 93 years previously and both were victimized twice			1
" @entity30 was racially abused and then sent off , @entity24 was also abused before being dropped by @entity70 and eventually sold			1
" both men were punished twice			0
it 's funny how something which happened nearly a century ago could be so relevant			0
" @entity103 decides against appealing @entity105 racism verdict if it was n't for @entity82 's work the story of the man who changed the face of football for black @entity110 could have been confined to the scrapheap of history			2
although @entity115 , a goalkeeper from @entity116 , was the first professional black player to have competed at the top level in @entity28 , it is @entity24 who is credited with being a pioneer as he was the first black outfield player			1
giant strides initially @entity82 's attempts to get publishers or media outlets interested in @entity24 's story appeared to hit a dead end			1
" i first came across him in 1993 and there was nothing contemporary about him , he had almost become forgotten , " @entity82 recalled			0
" in the first years , i could n't get anyone interested in it			0
over time , the interest has grown and he 's now got publicity			0
" with the play and the film , we 're hoping to show people that whatever obstacles you face , you can achieve the things you strive for			0
" on a political level , things are never simplistic			0
@entity142 may have been a different place for black people at that time and there was prejudice			2
" but at the same time , there were a number of progressive institutions and people who helped the black community and @entity24 on their way			1
@entity153 hosts talks on football racism " symbolically , @entity142 has been a multicultural place for a long time			0
@entity24 had a black father and a white mother and if you look at the number of mixed - race footballers , he led the way for them			1
" but what would @entity84 have made of the recent events in @entity19 ? and what would he have though of the @entity103 racism saga that has proved so divisive for @entity69 footall over the last year ? " i think he would have been very sad , " said @entity82			1
" @entity142 is a different place today than it was when @entity24 was alive and there have been giant strides			1
" he was the only black outfield player in the top division at one time and now that is n't the case			1
he was a great role model and led the way for those that play today			0
" football pioneer : @entity182 - the first black international @entity24 , who was born in @entity184 , @entity185 , on april 28 , 1888 , endured a difficult childhood with illness , death and poverty plaguing the family			1
the grandson of slaves in @entity194 , his father arrived in @entity28 in 1876 following abolition some 43 years earlier			0
@entity24 's mother , @entity195 , died when he was just seven before his father passed away two years later			1
with all six children surviving their parents ' death , the demands on their stepmother , @entity197 , were too much to bear and @entity24 along with his brother @entity201 were taken to live in a @entity203 orphanage in @entity204 , east @entity205			1
when @entity201 was adopted two years later by a couple from @entity207 and went on to become the first black dentist in the city , @entity24 turned to football to help with his solitude			1
it was here , while training to be a printer , @entity24 caught the eye with his football skills and soon won a trial with amateur side @entity218 vitriolic racism his success , which helped the club win the @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225 in the 1908 - 1909 season , secured him a dream move to @entity70			1
the transfer made @entity24 just the second black professional player in the @entity69 top division and the first outfield player			1
after making his debut at the age of 21 , @entity24 enjoyed success at @entity70 until a vitriolic episode of racism at @entity237 in october 1909			1
crime and punishment in sport : laying down the law ? " the game at @entity20 was the first time i came across racism being mentioned in a match report , " said @entity82			0
" in previous reports , writers would use coded language such as ' @entity24 took unwarranted abuse ' but there was no hiding it in this @entity20 game			2
" the @entity252 described the @entity237 fans racist chants as " lower than @entity255 " , while another newspaper labeled it as " a cowardly attack "			0
one reporter vented his fury by writing , " let me tell those @entity20 hooligans that @entity24 is so clean in his mind and method as to be a model for all white men who play football			2
" the episode appeared to embarrass @entity70 , which promptly dropped @entity24 from the team and sold him to @entity269			1
under @entity270 , the future manager of @entity271 , @entity24 enjoyed great success , making 110 appearances and attracting the interest of @entity276 giants @entity275			2
the @entity26 broke out in 1914 , with @entity24 signing up to the 17th @entity277 of the @entity278 , which was nicknamed , " the @entity279 "			1
@entity280 apologizes for outburst over @entity103 racism case he was involved in combat at the end of the @entity285 between october and november 1916 , before being sent back to @entity28 suffering from trench foot and shell shock			0
after making a full recovery , @entity24 was ordered to go up to @entity276 to the @entity289 , despite military regulations forbidding those who were not of " pure @entity293 descent " from becoming officers			2
military bravery in may 1917 , he was appointed an officer , despite it being technically illegal			2
" i guess he never received the medal because the rules at the time prohibited it , " added @entity82			0
" perhaps those on the ground did n't realize and some civil servant or bureaucrat must have pointed it out			0
" they could n't have given an award to a black soldier and not a white soldier at the time			2
" @entity24 's military success continued as he became the first black officer in the @entity25 to lead troops into battle			1
in @entity316 , he led his men at the @entity318 and was commended for his outstanding leadership abilities by his peers			0
@entity24 's efforts did not go unnoticed and he was recommended for the @entity322 , but never received it			2
@entity324 defender @entity280 charged with misconduct after abusive tweet after finishing in @entity316 , @entity24 was transferred to the @entity327 in @entity328			1
it was on march 25 , 1918 while trying to escape a @entity331 advance at @entity332 , that he was fatally injured by machine gun fire			0
" such was @entity24 's bond with his men that even with the machine guns firing , his men still tried to recover his body , " said @entity82			2
" they risked their lives to try and bring him back because he was a person who they all looked up to and respected			0
he was a very humble character , who wanted to be judged by his actions and deeds			0
" i think that his @entity203 background gave him a code to live by and helped guide him through life			0
" @entity24 , the play , is at the @entity346 in @entity91 from february 21 and march 16 .			2
