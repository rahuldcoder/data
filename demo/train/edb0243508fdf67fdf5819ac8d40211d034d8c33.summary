-- the world finally is starting to wake up to the plight of the pangolin -- an awesomely introverted , scale - covered mammal that 's capable off fending of lions but gets snatched right up by poachers			1
the @entity8 said this week it considers all eight species of pangolin to be threatened with extinction because of the black market trade in its meat and scales			1
" in the 21st century we really should not be eating species to extinction , " @entity15 , co-chair of the @entity8 's pangolin specialist group , said in a statement			1
" there is simply no excuse for allowing this illegal trade to continue			1
" related : the most trafficked mammal you 've never heard of the @entity8 , which publishes the well - known " @entity26 " of threatened species , now estimates more than 1 million pangolins were poached in the last decade			1
that 's a staggering number -- pangolins already were thought to be the most trafficked mammals in the world -- and an important reminder that the world could lose these amazing little creatures if more is n't done , immediately , to protect them			2
when i went to @entity38 and @entity39 earlier this year to report undercover on the pangolin market , i came across a number of reasons the trade continues unabated			1
conservation groups do n't make the pangolin a priority			2
they focus on the " charismatic " animals -- panda , rhino , tigers -- instead of these awkward introverts			0
the pangolin needs a serious @entity56 campaign in order to survive -- and an army of supporters who recognize how incredibly cool it is			2
to that effect , here are some fun pangolin facts : 2			2
governments in @entity65 and @entity66 have been slow to crack down on the illegal trade			1
i found pangolin meat easily available on restaurant menus in @entity71 , @entity38 , and am told by activists that little is done to stop pangolin consumption			2
it 's not just about busting the poachers			2
for this trade to end , there need to be incentives for poachers to stop poaching -- as well as for pangolin consumers , primarily in @entity38 and @entity66 , to stop eating pangolin meat as a delicacy			1
i 'm thankful to @entity0 readers for donating more than $ 17,000 toward the creation of a pangolin public service announcement in @entity71 , @entity38			0
similar efforts must be made in @entity66			0
source countries , including @entity39 , must create jobs and other opportunities for people who now work in the black market			0
low - level poachers are trying to buy milk for their kids , not get rich			0
and with better economic opportunities , they would leave the trade			0

" our global strategy to halt the decline of the world 's pangolins needs to be urgently implemented , " @entity106 , co-chair of the @entity8 's pangolin group , said in a statement			1
" a vital first step is for the @entity66 and @entity38 governments to conduct an inventory of their pangolin scale stocks and make this publicly available to prove that wild - caught pangolins are no longer supplying the commercial trade			1
" i 'm saddened by this week 's news about the size of the pangolin trade and that it now involves all eight species			1
but this is also an opportunity			0
i 'm confident the more people know about the pangolin , the more they 'll insist on its protection			0
they 'll do things like start petitions asking @entity136 to cast a pangolin in an animated film			0
or they 'll create meme - y online videos like these two from @entity0 readers			0
that stuff is goofy but meaningful			0
if the pangolin has a big enough fan club , governments and conservation organizations are bound to listen -- and to do more to help these defenseless underdogs			0
the pangolin 's survival may rest in people being able to see it as sassy and cool			1
the good thing : it 's both of those			0
we just have to take time to notice .			0
