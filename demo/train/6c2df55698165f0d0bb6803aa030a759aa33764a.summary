@entity0 -- a prominent @entity3 conservative said tuesday that the immigration reform bill under consideration in the @entity6 is part of an ongoing plot to build a massive new @entity10 voting bloc			1
@entity13 's growing @entity12 vote is " a huge boon for @entity15			0
they have known that for a long time , " said rep. @entity16 , @entity17			1
their message has been that " we are going to recruit all you folks			0
that we are going to give amnesty to ( you ) to become @entity15			0
" @entity10 leaders " are in the process of seeking to establish another monolithic voting bloc , " he said			1
republicans backing the bipartisan @entity6 bill " completely ignore that fact			2
" @entity16 made his remarks at a @entity36 press conference with several other @entity3 conservatives taking aim at the " @entity41 " legislation drafted by four @entity15 and four @entity6 republicans			1
controversial immigration report may be right the bill is winding its way through the @entity45			1
two committee republicans from the " @entity41 , " @entity47 's @entity46 and @entity49 's @entity48 , have been working with the panel 's @entity10 majority to prevent any major changes to the bill			1
another @entity3 conservative at the press conference with @entity16 , @entity58 rep. @entity57 , noted the length of the proposal by the " @entity41 , " 844 pages " when in recent years have we passed such a large bill and had a good outcome ? " @entity57 asked			1
" i 'll give you @entity66 and @entity67 ( financial reform ) as good examples of that			0
i really think we need to tear this thing up and start from the beginning			0
" rep. @entity72 , @entity73 , said the " @entity41 " would be defeated by a " gang of millions			1

so far , however , they have not presented any broad - based agreement			0
backers of the " @entity41 " legislation are hoping to ultimately win as many as 70 votes in the 100 - member @entity6 to give the legislation serious momentum heading into the more conservative @entity3			2
the " @entity41 " blueprint would create a 13 - year path to citizenship for the bulk of @entity13 's 11 million undocumented immigrants while bringing significant change to labor policy on the country 's farms			2
the bill commits additional resources to security along the @entity105 border and creates a new system of metrics to measure border control effectiveness			2
