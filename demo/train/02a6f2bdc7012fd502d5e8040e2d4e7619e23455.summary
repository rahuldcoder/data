-- an @entity2 man said he does n't hate african - americans and counts some of them among his best friends			0
murder and hate crime charges were filed on friday accusing him and another man of killing three strangers because they were black			1
@entity9 , lawyer for 19 - year - old @entity10 , told reporters friday he would not comment specifically about the april 6 shootings that left three dead and two others wounded in @entity14 , @entity2			1
he did show a video of an interview his team conducted and recorded with @entity18 from jail , in which the suspect described the trauma of watching first his father and then , nearly two years later , his girlfriend being shot dead a few feet away from him			1
@entity18 also talked of growing up and living in @entity14 , which has a large @entity25 - @entity25 community , and saying he had friends of all races			1
" i always got along with everybody , " he said in the tape , recorded friday morning			0
" it did n't matter what color he was			1
" that view is starkly different from the portrayal of @entity18 offered by prosecutors , as well as in the probable cause affidavit that led to the arrest of him and 33 - year - old @entity39			1
in addition to commenting on his girlfriend 's suicide in january , @entity18 lamented his father 's death exactly two years earlier " at the hands of a f -- king n --- - r " in an april 5 message on his @entity48 page			1
@entity18 said in the jailhouse interview that he used those words " just to express how i was upset at the guy who shot my @entity55 " and they do not mean he was a racist			1
authorities say he and @entity39 went into a largely @entity25 section of @entity14 shortly after midnight and gunned down apparent strangers at four locations			1
two men and one woman died after being shot in the chest -- with one of them found " lying face down " outside a funeral home -- while two others were shot and survived			0
all the shooting victims are black			2
police have identified @entity39 and @entity18 as white , though the probable cause affidavit released friday noted @entity18 was a co-owner of a truck that had @entity73 license plates			1
three @entity75 tips helped lead authorities to the men , according to the affidavit			0
in the first , made last saturday , a caller described @entity18 as " a racist ( who ) hates black males " and said he had " bragged about other shootings			1
" another person phoned to say that @entity18 had gone off to burn his truck , which was similar to the vehicle seen by several people -- including one of the survivors -- in and around the area where the shootings took place			1
sheriff deputies soon after found a 1989 @entity95 truck with the @entity73 tag on fire in @entity14			1
the third caller to contact @entity75 on april 7 said @entity18 had " made several comments about killing black people " and wanted " justice " for his father 's killing			1
this person added that @entity18 " uses drugs and will not go down without a fight			1
" neither @entity18 nor @entity39 offered resistance when they were taken into custody early sunday , @entity108 capt. @entity107 said			1
@entity18 confessed to shooting three people , while fellow suspect @entity39 admitted to police that he shot the other two , both of which were fatal , according to police documents			1
@entity116 district attorney @entity115 on friday filed charges against both men on three counts of first - degree murder tied to the deaths of 54 - year - old @entity122 , 49 - year - old @entity123 and 31 - year - old @entity124			0
they also face two counts of shooting with intent to kill related to the two people who were wounded , according to the press release from the district attorney 's office			2
in addition , the men face five counts of malicious harassment			0
the district attorney notes that , according to @entity2 law , the charge infers that a person has acted " maliciously and with the specific intent to intimidate or harass another person because of that person 's race , color , religion , ancestry , national origin or disability			2
" the charge is equivalent to a hate crime under @entity2 law , according to partners @entity150 , a joint project of the @entity153 , the @entity154 and the @entity155 for preventing hate nonprofit groups			0
the rev. @entity157 , speaking friday outside the @entity158 in @entity14 , challenged why this " hate crime " charge is considered a misdemeanor , and not a felony , in @entity2			2
the maximum penalty for a conviction is a year in prison and a $ 1,000 fine			0
still , the civil rights leader lauded authorities for filing charges in the case that effectively asserted the victims were targeted due to their race			0
the rev. @entity172 voiced a similar sentiment , canceling a planned trip to @entity14 and saying in a statement he was " glad that ( prosecutors ) filed first - degree murder and hate crime charges			1
" " we 're glad that they 've made that decision in the right direction today , " @entity157 said			0
@entity9 said he decided to represent @entity18 after getting a letter monday from the suspect 's mother , who has been incarcerated for the past 11 years			1
the lawyer described his client as a hard - working young man who had served as a father figure to his teenage sister and is himself the father of a baby son born to his late girlfriend			0
he also said @entity18 harbors no ill will toward african - americans			2
" many ( of his friends ) are black			2
he has family members that are black			2
and there 's no hatred of blacks in him at all , " said @entity9			0
the @entity202 is investigating the @entity14 shootings to determine if federal civil rights were violated , said spokeswoman @entity205			2
she called it an " open investigation , " but not a hate crimes investigation per se			0
@entity39 and @entity18 will appear in court monday , when a judge will set a date for a preliminary hearing			2
prosecutors filed a motion friday asking that both defendants be held without bond and not be released if they come up with the $ 9.16 million bond set monday , when authorities outlined murder but not the malicious harassment charges			1
" both defendants are a danger to public safety in this community , and they have strong incentive to flee the jurisdiction if they were able to make bond , " the prosecution argued			0
the maximum sentence for each charge of shooting with intent to kill is life in prison			0
@entity18 and @entity39 could face anywhere from life with the possibility of parole or a death sentence for the murder charges			2
first district attorney @entity239 said in a press release that the prosecution likely will decide whether to seek the death penalty after the preliminary hearing is complete			0
calling the shootings " tragic and senseless , " @entity239 characterized the filing of charges as a " first step to obtain justice			0
" @entity157 similarly cautioned against celebrating too early that the suspects were detained and charged , noting the legal process ahead could be long and complicated			0
" this is a first down , not a touchdown , " he said			0
" this is a charge , not a conviction			0
" @entity0 's @entity255 contributed to this report .			0
