-- hidden under a quaint resort 60 miles northeast of @entity2 , @entity3 , lies a treasure trove of potential energy that 's free and available 24/7			1
" @entity9 " @entity6 and his wife , @entity7 , own @entity8 near @entity2 , @entity3			1
@entity3 entrepreneur @entity6 has pioneered modern technology to tap into one of @entity13 's oldest energy resources : hot water			1
@entity6 , 56 , likes to call himself an " imagineer			0
" using imagination to fuel his engineering ambitions , this tenacious thinker and self - starter has figured out a way to generate electricity using water that 's the temperature of a cup of coffee -- about 165 degrees @entity25			1
" there 's more opportunity now than there has ever been in the history of man , but we have to reinvent ourselves , " @entity6 said			0
@entity6 was determined to reinvent the way he consumed energy after he and his wife , @entity7 , purchased the @entity8 from the state of @entity3 in 1998			1
" after we purchased the hot spring , i could n't believe it , the swimming pool and the hot spring were being heated by diesel fuel , 1,000 gallons every month ! " @entity6 said			2
to slash costs and to use resources that were right under his nose , @entity6 invented a portable geothermal power plant			1
in a little more than three years , @entity6 and his wife have severed the facility 's dependence on diesel fuel and have saved $ 625,000 , he said			1
@entity6 's partnered with the @entity48 to fund half of a $ 1.4 million exploration project to find and characterize the geothermal resources at @entity8			1
" it 's a model for what you can do , " said @entity6			0
@entity6 developed his tenacity from growing up as the sixth child of 16 siblings on a farm outside of @entity59 , @entity60			0
he said his parents taught him hard work , how to recycle his clothes and shoes , and how to compost food and farm wastes			0
in the late 1970s , @entity6 was active in gold mining in @entity3 's @entity68 , and he established the state 's largest recycling facility in 1984 , he said			2
many of his ideas stem from finding alternative ways to use and reuse resources he already has at his fingertips			0
after acquiring the 400 - acre resort , @entity6 began trapping water from the underground hot springs , which produce enough power to heat the facility 's greenhouses year - round			1
most recently , @entity6 has turned his invention into a separate business by contracting with @entity86 hotel and casino in @entity88 , @entity89 , to build a similar system there			0
his portable geothermal generator units cost from $ 350,000 to $ 375,000 , each with the potential to generate enough power for 250 average @entity95 homes per year			1
' @entity96 taps ' his energy - generating machine lies on a flatbed truck and can be hooked up to oil and gas wells or other heat - emitting sources to generate electricity			2
@entity6 adds a branch connection to an oil or gas pipeline , and the process begins when he " hot taps " into waste water coming through the pipes			2
the hot water enters the tubes of an evaporator encased in a common refrigerant found in many air conditioning systems			2
as the hot water passes through the evaporator , it begins to boil the refrigerant in the casing surrounding the tubes			0
the heat given off by the boiling refrigerant then causes an attached turbine to spin , which jump - starts a generator , producing electrical power			2
next , cooling water enters from another source , recondensing the vapor refrigerant into a liquid			0
a pump pushes the liquid refrigerant back to the evaporator , so the cycle can start again			0
the difference in temperatures drives the entire " binary system			0
" this setup works exactly the opposite of a refrigerator			0
" @entity8 is home to the lowest - temperature geothermal resource to be used for commercial power production in the world , " @entity6 said			1
" oil companies do n't drill wells for water , but they have some 5,000 kilowatts of geothermal power at their disposal in unused oil wells			1
let 's pick the low - hanging fruit and use the wells we have for oil for geothermal power , " he said			1
citing a 2007 @entity154 study , @entity6 said harnessing just 2 percent of @entity13 's internal energy could provide 2,000 times more energy than the entire planet currently consumes -- all free of polluting greenhouse gas emissions			2
" everything goes back , there is no pollution , no smokestack , " he said			0
" we are going to go recycle oil wells and recycle water and put it back in the ground			0
" sizzle from the center of the @entity13 though @entity6 's lower - temperature approach is new , for more than a century , people have been trying to generate electricity from the heat that sizzles from the center of the @entity13 -- using it to cook , bathe and for electricity			2
in fact , the word " geothermal " comes from the @entity180 words geo ( @entity13 ) and therme ( heat )			0
" we 've determined that heat mining can be economical in the short term , based on a global analysis of existing geothermal systems , an assessment of the total @entity95 resource and continuing improvements in deep - drilling and reservoir stimulation technology , " said @entity154 professor @entity182			1
in a 2007 study , professors at @entity154 found that mining the huge amounts of heat that reside as stored thermal energy in the @entity13 's hard rock crust could supply a substantial portion of the electricity the @entity95 will need in the future , probably at competitive prices and with minimal environmental impact			1
" ... if we just drill deep enough , most of the @entity95 can be transformed into a huge geothermal power zone while drastically reducing the nation 's carbon footprint , " the @entity154 report said			1
widespread geothermal power fuels electricity in a couple dozen countries , with the small island nation of @entity210 leading the pack			1
an unusual abundance of geothermal sources creates 30 percent of @entity210 's energy , according to its @entity215			0
" imagination is so important , " said @entity6 , whose resort houses 65 employees and can house 210 guests at maximum capacity			0
" if @entity6 , one of the smallest mom - and - pop operators in the world , can do these things , then why ca n't all of us ? "			0

resort owner makes electricity with water the temperature of a cup of coffee
@entity3 entrepreneur goes from diesel to geothermal , saving $ 625k in 3 years
he invented portable geothermal generator that he says can power 250 homes
@entity154 : most of @entity95 can be transformed into a huge geothermal power zone
