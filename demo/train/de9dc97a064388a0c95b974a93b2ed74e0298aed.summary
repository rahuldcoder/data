-- @entity2 cycling chief @entity1 announced tuesday he would challenge @entity4 @entity3 for the top job at the @entity6 -- promising to clean up the sport in the wake of the @entity10 doping scandal			1
@entity1 , 61 , told @entity0 that he was standing for election as president of the world governing body because he was unhappy with its failure to deal with the issues raised since @entity10 made his public admission of guilt last year			1
" we are still mired in controversy from the @entity10 era , " said @entity1			1
" we need to clean that up and deal with historic accusations			0
" @entity1 has been credited with turning around the fortunes of the @entity2 federation , which he rescued from the brink of bankruptcy in the 1990s			0
latterly , riders such as reigning @entity31 champion @entity30 , @entity32 and the track cycling team led by the now retired @entity34 , have catapulted @entity2 cycling to worldwide prominence			0
@entity1 , while quick to give credit to others for recent triumphs , believes that record will strengthen his claims come the election at the @entity6 annual congress in @entity44 , @entity45 in september			1
" i 'm very proud of the success we have achieved with @entity2 cycling and not in a way which generates conflict which seems to the @entity6 's modus operandi for the last several years , " he said			2
" i believe there is a massive appetite for change from people out there who are dissatisfied with the way the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) is running the sport			2
" @entity1 , who has sat on the @entity6 management board with @entity3 since 2009 , said he had no qualms about opposing him now			1
" i 've supported @entity3 in the past , but i have n't undermined him and now we are in an election period you need to stand up and be counted			0
" @entity1 acknowledged that progress had been made since @entity3 took over the presidency in 2006 , but was impatient for further reforms			1
" i want to see an organization fit for a modern era which is accountable and which people can trust			0
" @entity3 and the @entity70 - based @entity6 has come under intense spotlight since the publication of a damning report from the @entity75 @entity74 ( @entity76 ) last october , which laid bare the doping culture of @entity10 and other leading riders			1
@entity10 was forced to own up in a live television appearance with @entity80 and was subsequently stripped of his seven @entity31 wins			0
question marks were also raised about the @entity6 's role during @entity10 's era of domination and allegations have been made it was complicit in covering up positive tests			2
it has also been at loggerheads with the @entity90 ( @entity90 ) over the establishment of an independent commission , which would have attempted to get full disclosure of the extent of doping in cycling , but was disbanded by the @entity6 before it could report			2
@entity1 said his first priority would be to restore confidence and credibility in the sport			0
" we must also urgently carry out a fully independent investigation into the allegations of corruption in this area which have so damaged the @entity6 's reputation , " he said in his official supporting statement on the @entity102 website			0
despite the controversies , the 63 - year - old @entity3 has put himself forward as president for a third time and was formally nominated by the @entity70 federation last month			0
in a statement released at the time , @entity3 said he stood by his record : " i put myself forward to serve another term as @entity6 president on my record of developing the sport throughout the world and on combating the scourge of doping in cycling , " he said			1
" i have received a wealth of letters from national federations all around the world urging me to stand for president again			0
" @entity3 and @entity1 are the only two publicly declared and nominated candidates at present , but former @entity31 champion @entity128 -- a fierce critic the current president -- has also hinted he may run for the job .			1
