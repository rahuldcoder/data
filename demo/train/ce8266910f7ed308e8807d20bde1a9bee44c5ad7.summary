@entity0 -- one of the great headaches of the @entity4 dream is about to get less painful			2
the road to college promises to be a little easier with the coming shorter @entity8 forms			1
millions of parents and students will have much shorter federal applications for financial aid to pay for college			0
the form , known as @entity8 , is infamous for its detail and is considered by critics to be more painful and complex than a tax return			2
the @entity18 plans to unveil a shorter @entity8 on wednesday , cutting out more than a quarter of the questions and slashing the online version from 30 screens down to just 10			1
and in a partnership with the @entity24 , many families will be able to automatically download their tax data into online @entity8 forms starting in january			1
education secretary @entity27 is expected to announce those changes for the 2010 - 2011 school year at the daily @entity30 briefing wednesday , along with a proposal for @entity32 to cut even more bulk from the @entity8			1
in a statement obtained by @entity1 , the @entity35 appointee linked the slash in paperwork to the administration 's economic push			0
" we have to educate our way to a better economy , " @entity27 said			0
" young people and adult learners deserve the chance to go to college and to know the money they need is available			0
" the changes to the @entity8 are often commonsense , dropping obscure specifics that affect few students ' status , such as " special combat pay			2

the education chief wants @entity32 to cut out a number of questions that either affect very few students or are impossible to verify , including a particularly stress - inducing series about parental assets			1
