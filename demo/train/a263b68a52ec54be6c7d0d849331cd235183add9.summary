the @entity1 will send president @entity3 legislation authorizing the use of military force against @entity6 shortly after the @entity7 takes majority control in january , presumed senate majority leader @entity0 said monday			1
in an interview with @entity12 's @entity11 , the @entity9 @entity7 said he 'd like to see @entity3 ask @entity13 for such a measure -- but that one is coming anyway			1
" it would be even better if the president asked us for what he wants , but we 're not going to wait forever , " @entity16 said			1
" we 're certainly going to need to use force , there 's no question about it			2
they 're beheading @entity25 and posting it on the @entity27			2
they 're a serious threat to our national security			0
and we 're going to have to act , " he said			0
he signaled that crafting legislation green - lighting military action , which is already underway against @entity6 in @entity33 and @entity34 , could be an item on which @entity36 could work with @entity3			1
" i think the president is moving in that direction himself , " @entity16 said			1
" he 'd be in a much stronger position with an authorization of the use of military force			1
we 've been sort of expecting him to ask for it , but if he does n't , i think he will get one sometime soon after the first of the year			0
" the @entity45 will start its debate on authorizing the use of military force against @entity6 this week			1
secretary of state @entity49 is set to appear before the panel tuesday			0
meanwhile , sens. @entity51 , @entity9 , and @entity52 , @entity53 , are pushing for a vote on a bill that would approve @entity25 action			1
that measure , though , would n't advance in time for a vote before senators are expected to wrap up their post-election " lame duck " session and leave @entity62			2
@entity16 said he does n't want a vote in december , but that with the new @entity7 majority in place in january , " we 'll address it at the beginning of next year			1
" in the interview , @entity16 previewed his plans for the final two years of @entity3 's tenure -- saying he expects the @entity1 to pass legislation approving the @entity74 pipeline , forcing the president into a tough veto decision , and to " push back against this overactive bureaucracy " on environmental regulations			1
he also said he expects votes to repeal @entity3 's signature health care law , as well as some of its key components , including the individual mandate that all @entity25 have health insurance and its tax on medical device - makers			1
but @entity16 , pointing to a meeting with @entity3 last week , said @entity36 might be able to agree with the president on a few issues			1
" it would be better , obviously , if we can get some results			0
and he and i had an opportunity to talk last week			0
and we agreed to talk about the things that we might agree on , " @entity16 said			1
" and there are some , " he said			0
there may be a path forward on comprehensive tax reform			0
we have certainly a lot of bipartisan interest in the crumbling infrastructure in the country and what to do about it			0
my first choice is to make progress for the country			0
" @entity16 said his meeting with @entity3 was " unusual -- we 've not had a chance to talk very much			1
" but he said that 's no surprise , since the president took office with hefty @entity118 majorities and the party kept control of the @entity1 until november			1
@entity16 said he 's " not opposed to negotiating with the administration			2
" " now he needs to talk to us and that 's good , because when the @entity25 people elect divided government , they 're not saying they do n't want anything done , " @entity16 said			2
" what they are saying is they want things done in the political center , things that both sides can agree on			0
and in the conversation last week , we talked about the things where there may be some agreement			0
" @entity16 left the door open to congressional action on immigration -- which both @entity16 and @entity143 speaker @entity142 , @entity144 , had said would be made much more difficult by @entity3 's executive action halting deportations for the undocumented parents of @entity25 citizens			1
" what we 're going to do is try to figure out the best way to respond to what the president has done			2
we know we have a broken immigration system			0
we know the border is not secure			0
we know that we need an expansion in @entity157 visas			0
we need an improvement in the agricultural guest worker program , " @entity16 said			2
" there are a whole lot of things that need to be done to improve our immigration system			0
and i hope the president had made it possible for us to -- to deal with those issues			2

@entity0 says the @entity1 will vote on a bill authorizing military action against @entity6 in early 2015
the *incoming* @entity1 majority leader says he wants president @entity3 to request the authority for war
@entity3 would be in a " much stronger position " if the fight against @entity6 with congressional support , @entity16 says
