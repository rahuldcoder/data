@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's prime minister delivered a sober message wednesday to @entity6 : do n't export terror			1
" we want to see a strong and a stable and a democratic @entity6 , " @entity9 said in @entity10 , @entity1 , " but we can not tolerate in any sense the idea that this country is allowed to look both ways and is able in any way to promote the export of terror , whether to @entity1 or whether to @entity18 , or anywhere else in the world			1
" @entity9 made several remarks in a speech and a question and answer session			1
a transcript of his comments were posted on the prime minister 's website			0
" the relationship is important , but it should be a relationship based on a very clear message that it is not right ... to have any relationship with groups that are promoting terror			0
@entity36 states that want to be part of the developed world can not do that , and the message to @entity6 from the @entity41 and from the @entity4 is very clear on that point , " he said			1
his remarks come as the military documents divulged by @entity45 include indications that @entity6 's spy service , the @entity47 , or the @entity48 , may have been helping militants in @entity18 , an assertion strongly disputed by @entity6 officials			1
the @entity41 has been working to help bolster the @entity6 government 's efforts to battle @entity55 and @entity56 elements in the country			1
the @entity59 - led command has been focused on insurgents operating along the @entity18 and @entity6 border , and @entity1 has long been concerned about militancy in @entity1 that comes from @entity6			1
he also said that @entity1 and @entity4 must work closer on security , saying " the terrorists we face are adept at crossing borders , communicating globally , and concocting the most abhorrent plans to destroy our way of life			1
" " five years ago , 52 people were killed on the tube and on a bus in @entity74			0
and in november 2008 , we watched in horror as terrorists went on the rampage in @entity79 , killing scores of @entity1 and three @entity4 nationals			1
as you know , we worked with your government in the investigation into these events , " @entity9 said			2
" we remain determined that those responsible must be brought to justice			0
" he said that when it comes to protecting their mutual citizenry , developments in @entity18 and @entity6 ca n't be " overlooked			2
" " let me state clearly : your relations with those two countries are a matter for you and you alone			0
but let me also say we , like you , want a @entity6 that is stable , democratic and free from terror			2
we , like you , want an @entity18 that is secure , free from interference from its neighbors and not a threat to our security			0
we , like you , are determined that groups like the @entity55 , the @entity106 or @entity107 should not be allowed to launch attacks on @entity1 and @entity4 citizens in @entity1 or in @entity4			1
neither should they be able to do so against our people , whether soldiers or civilians , from both our countries who are working for peace in @entity18			0
our interests are your interests , so let us work together to realize them			0
" when asked about @entity9 's remarks , a spokesman for @entity6 's @entity122 said @entity4 and @entity6 " have a robust and comprehensive partnership , including on counter-terrorism			1
" " terrorists have no religion , no humanity , no specific ethnicity or geography			0
@entity132 ' networks , as the @entity4 knows full well mutate and operate in different regions and cities			2
the genesis of terrorism as a global phenomenon warrants close attention			0
@entity6 is as much a victim of terrorism as are @entity18 , @entity1 or other countries , " the statement said			1
" @entity6 has done much more than any other country in combating terrorism			1
our people and security forces have rendered innumerable sacrifices			0
we hope that our friends will be able to persuade @entity1 to view this issue objectively and the value of ' cooperation ' in counter-terrorism			2
" @entity6 has a troubled history with @entity1 , and in the past @entity1 has accused the @entity48 of supporting militant separatists in @entity1 - administered @entity156			1
@entity6 and @entity18 also have a tumultuous past			2
during the @entity160 occupation of @entity18 in the 1980s , religious schools in @entity6 helped train fighters who battled the @entity160			2
after the @entity55 took over @entity18 in 1996 and imposed fundamentalist rule , @entity6 was one of the few countries that recognized the regime diplomatically			2
it dropped its support after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on @entity168 and @entity169			0
@entity107 , which means " @entity107 , " was blamed for the november 2008 @entity79 attack in which nearly 200 people were killed over three days			0
the man regarded as the group 's leader says it was n't involved in the act despite evidence to the contrary			0
experts say that group claims it is focused on the same issue as it was when created : freeing the disputed territory of @entity156 from @entity1 rule -- a dispute that has been the source of great tension between @entity1 and @entity6 for decades			1
security is n't the only item on @entity9 's agenda			1
he intends to boost business and trade ties , and will meet @entity1 prime minister @entity190 on thursday			0
@entity9 visited @entity191 a day earlier , where he pushed for @entity191 membership in the @entity193 and also addressed world crises including the tensions in the @entity197 territory of @entity198 , which he labeled a " prison			0
