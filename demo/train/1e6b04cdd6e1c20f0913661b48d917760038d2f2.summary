-- it 's not every day that just two football matches produce a cricket score -- in this case an incredible 146 goals -- and @entity7 football authorities are so suspicious of the games in question that they have been referred to the police as a " criminal matter			1
" as both @entity13 and @entity14 battled to reach the fifth tier of the @entity7 football league on monday , the amateur sides racked up 79 - 0 and 67 - 0 wins respectively			1
at half - time , the teams had managed a relatively meager 13 goals between them -- only for the avalanche to begin as the teams tried to outdo one another on goal difference			0
the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) indefinitely suspended the winning sides and their beaten opponents as it launched an investigation into an incident it termed " a mind - boggling show of shame never previously witnessed in @entity7 football			1
" the scores were the biggest seen in @entity37 football since @entity39 's @entity38 won 149 - 0 in a 2002 match where losing side @entity41 scored numerous own goals in protest at a refereeing decision			1
" we have reported the matter to police as it is a criminal matter , " the @entity25 's assistant media director @entity46 , told @entity0			1
" they will do their due diligence , and we will also do our own investigation			0
the results of our investigation are likely to result in very , very severe penalties for all involved			2
the clubs may be banned for life			0
" one of the losing sides , @entity60 , has already been disbanded by its president following their thrashing by @entity14 , while @entity65 were the side who shipped 79 goals			1
like the @entity25 , @entity60 owner @entity68 also referred the incident to police in @entity71 , which is where the playoff matches took place			1
but those associated with the club can not wash their hands of the matter by simply closing @entity60 down , says @entity46			0
" we still have details of their officials , " he explained			0
" they still exist as people and they will have to answer to the police			0
" in its initial statement , the @entity25 described the results as " scandalous "			1
the material benefit for whichever side won promotion was minimal , says @entity46 , and the players themselves would gain little by stepping up a division			0
even wages for those playing in @entity7 's elite @entity96 rarely top $ 200 per month			0
" getting into the ( fifth ) division is no great shakes financially , " the @entity25 media spokesman said			2
" even clubs in the second division struggle to make ends meet			0
there is sponsorship for teams in the @entity96 but very little compared to what they pay to play games around the country			0
" football 's world governing body @entity113 is also interested in what action the @entity25 takes			1
" the matter is firstly the responsibility of the @entity112 [ @entity25 ] , " @entity113 told @entity0 in a statement			1
" therefore @entity113 is currently monitoring the situation and waiting for action taken by the @entity7 [ federation ]			2
" as they entered the third and final round of matches to determine which team would gain promotion to the @entity126 , @entity13 and @entity14 were level on points , goal difference and goals scored			1
both sides had managed a total of just two goals in their previous two games but at halftime in the decisive matches , @entity13 were 7 - 0 up and holding the advantage as their opponents had scored one fewer			1
the second half witnessed a tsunami of goals , with @entity13 netting on 72 occasions and @entity14 plundering 61 strikes themselves			1
@entity144 one thorny issue for those leading the inquiry is that @entity148 - based @entity14 are a side that represent @entity7 's police force			1
" this will be a very dispassionate job , " the @entity25 's @entity46 added			1
" we believe the police will do a fair job , no matter that a police team is involved			0
" i want to assure you that this matter will interest the director general of police , @entity159 , who is a former member of the @entity25 board			2
" @entity0 tried to contact police authorities in @entity7 but they were not immediately available for comment			2
neither were officials from clubs that traditionally lack presence both domestically and online			0
news of what leading @entity25 official @entity167 has called a " scandal of huge proportions " come in a year when @entity7 football has been on the up			2
earlier this year , the @entity37 country won the @entity174 when beating @entity175 in the final , the @entity179 ' first continental title since 1994 and their third overall			0
however , @entity46 does not believe the playoff farce will be of any detriment to the standing of @entity7 football around the world			0
" you have people who try to break the law everywhere			0
what matters are the steps that are taken next			0
we want to assure you that the @entity25 is on top of this			2
