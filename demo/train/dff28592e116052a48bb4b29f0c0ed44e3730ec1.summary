-- @entity2 mayor @entity1 has opened the door to @entity4 by considering an end to the ban on owning ferrets , which dates to 1959			1
@entity2 's ferret owners -- a shadowy underground that smuggles and coddles the beasts in defiance of the law -- say that their pets , which are legal to own everywhere in @entity14 except @entity15 and @entity16 , should not be banned from the city			1
if only things were that simple			0
having voluntarily chosen to live locked up in brick and steel towers , the 8 million homo sapiens who dwell in @entity2 tend to get antsy about the idea of sharing our fancy concrete cage with other animals			1
our wariness is codified in law , leaving no room for confusion : @entity31 of the @entity32 describes and classifies the species that can not be kept as pets , with mind - numbing taxonomic precision			2
barring professional exceptions like running a licensed zoo , circus or laboratory , says the code , it is illegal to own a polar , grizzly , or brown bear			0
@entity2 can not own bats , beavers , wolves , lemurs , hedgehogs , porcupines , elephants or dolphins			1
you might consider these prohibitions to be common sense			0
who needs a law ? you 'd be wrong			0
in 2003 , a @entity2 named @entity57 was discovered to be living in a @entity59 public housing project with an alligator and a 400 - pound bengal tiger			1
the situation came to light after @entity57 showed up at the emergency room with a suspiciously large bite wound			0
so the code is a guide to help people avoid getting hurt			0
it prohibits hooved animals , " including , but not limited to , deer , antelope , sheep , giraffe and hippopotamus			0
" sounds good to me			0
it 's hard enough to find parking on my block			2
who needs to worry about hippopotamuses taking up spaces ? @entity2 can not legally own members of the @entity85 family , including " kinkajou , cacomistle , cat - bear , panda and coatimundi			1
" again , no problem			0
to tell the truth , i never heard of any of those creatures except the panda -- although a cat - bear reminds me of a popular science fiction series i read as a kid , featuring 500 - pound feline aliens that nearly wipe out the human race			2
marsupials are prohibited in @entity2 : no @entity102 devils , no kangaroos , and none of those other odd - sounding down under critters like dasyure , bandicoot , cuscus and numbat			1
you also can not own any " nonhuman " primate			0
but unlike most of the beasts on the forbidden list , the wily ferrets have developed a political constituency			2
" they have an odd half - monkey , half - dog kind of intelligence that bonds them to their people and makes them always very interesting and often very funny " is how one owner described her pet to the @entity127 at a hearing in 1999			0
when pressed on the subject of ferret attacks on humans , one council member noted that @entity2 probably has more spouse bites than ferret bites			1
@entity135 , the mayor at the time , was having none of it			1
he famously berated a ferret advocate on a radio program , telling him , " there is something really , really , very sad about you , " and " this excessive concern with little weasels is a sickness			1
" @entity135 's rant remains posted online to this day , as does an official statement denouncing the creatures			1
fast - forward to 2014 , and a new mayor already embroiled in a high - profile battle over whether to ban horse - drawn carriages from the city			1
the @entity155 announced it has received a petition from the pro-ferret forces , and will duly consider lifting the ban			2
a word of advice to @entity1 : tread carefully			0
if the ferrets get traction , it 's hard to say where the revolution will end			1
people may want to have zorilles , wolverines or stoats			2
advocates for binturongs , fossa , linsangs and suricates -- whatever those are -- may follow the ferret freedom fighters			0
and the scene down at @entity176 , where one protest or another already takes place on any given day , could start to get truly wild .			0

@entity180 : @entity2 is considering an end to a 55 - year - old ban on owning ferrets
louis : @entity186 's owners of *undocumented* ferrets have submitted petition to lift the ban
louis : what 's next ? beavers , hedgehogs , elephants , wolverines , numbats , stoats ?
*ex-mayor* @entity135 hated ferrets , or " weasels , " famously berated activist . ( it 's online )
