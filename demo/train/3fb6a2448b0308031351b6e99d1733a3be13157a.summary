the elections were based on a fundamentally flawed process and demonstrated the regime 's continued preference for repression and restriction over inclusion and transparency			0
" opinion : why the @entity136 must not give up on @entity4 one of the biggest flaws was the imprisonment of more than 2,100 political prisoners , who were denied the opportunity to participate , @entity135 said			1

speaking during a visit to @entity168 , @entity166 said the country was holding " flawed elections that once again expose the abuses of the military junta			0
" and in a statement issued later sunday , she said the generals " missed an opportunity to begin genuine transition toward democratic governance and national reconciliation			0
