@entity0 -- ten years after an anthrax attack killed five people and awakened the nation to the dangers of bioterrorism , the @entity2 remains largely unprepared for a large - scale bioterrorism attack or deadly disease outbreak , according a new report from the @entity11			1
the report , released wednesday , gives the country mostly @entity14 's and @entity15 for its ability to handle small - scale events , such as the anthrax letter attack of 2001 , and failing grades for its ability to handle large - scale events , like the global epidemic depicted in the movie " contagion			1
" notably , the report gives the country a " @entity27 " across the board for the country 's ability to develop and quickly approve medical countermeasures such as diagnostic tools and vaccines , which are crucial in outbreaks of all sizes			1
the bipartisan center , headed by former sen. @entity37 , @entity38 , and former sen. @entity39 , @entity40 , is an offshoot of the congressionally chartered @entity42 , which concluded early last year			2
in its report , the center says the @entity2 has spent more than $ 65 billion on bio-defense during the past decade , but still has holes that leave it vulnerable			1
" today we face the very real possibility that outbreaks of disease -- naturally occurring or man - made -- can change the very nature of @entity2 , " the report concludes			1
technology is also making it easier for terrorists to create deadly mischief , the report says			1
a small team of individuals with graduate - level training and readily available equipment " could produce the type of bio-weapons created by nation - states in the 1960s , " the report warns			1
the threat is n't simply hypothetical , the report says			1
@entity71 , the presumed leader of @entity72 following the death of @entity74 , is a medical doctor with a known interest in bioterrorism , having started a bio-weapons program in @entity78 and @entity79 in 1999 , the report notes			1
the report 's authors say they recognize that budget constraints are preventing governments from addressing all of the shortcomings in current bio-terror preparedness			2
they recommend focusing on potential large - scale outbreaks , saying such preparations would automatically improve preparedness for smaller outbreaks			2
" if you focused just on the ' f ' grades , you can pour a lot of money down that hole , " said the center 's @entity90			0
" if we work to make @entity27 's into @entity15 , that is the best strategy for the nation			0
" such a strategy will mean improving detection and diagnosis of large - scale diseases and attacks , improving the development of medical countermeasures such as vaccines , and developing methods of dispensing those countermeasures to large populations			0
center president @entity111 said that because of budget pressures , she is " gravely concerned " about the nation 's ability to sustain gains in public health made during recent years			0
government leaders need to understand that biomedical programs " are not just nice - to - have programs			0
these are an integral part of our national security , " she stressed			0
the center stressed that one key to improving the nation 's preparedness is leadership			0
" we have recommended that there should be someone in the federal government who has ( bioterrorism preparedness ) as their sole responsibility , " @entity37 said			2
" that someone should be an individual who has the capability to direct and influence actions by the multiplicity of agencies that are involved and provide leadership to non-federal entities			0
" the office of the vice president would be an appropriate spot for that job , @entity37 suggested			0
the nation also needs to invest in " purpose - driven science , " the report concludes			1
scientific initiatives should focus on developing medical countermeasures to bio-weapons , environmental remediation , and bio-forensics to determine the source of attacks			0
@entity39 said the government should not follow the usual pattern of ignoring the threat until it is too late , and then throwing " enormous amounts of money at it			0
" instead , @entity39 said , the government should focus on the shortcomings identified in the report .			2

@entity2 is unprepared for a major bioterrorism attack or disease outbreak , a new report concludes
big concern is attack with *biological* weapons
*hospitals* could not handle deadly disease outbreak , says report
