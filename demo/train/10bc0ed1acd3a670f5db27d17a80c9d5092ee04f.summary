-- two reactions seize people in the face of a horrific event like the mass murder of little children in @entity7 , @entity8			2
the first is shock , the second is a rush into activity			1
the reason we rush into activity is to escape the numbness of shock and the pain that follows it			1
but if we bury ourselves in every detail of the story , staying glued to the tv , reliving the event in our imaginations and obsessing over the meaningless of violence , we may be working against the healing process rather than helping it			1
medical science knows a lot more about the effects of trauma on the brain than it did even five years ago			1
one salient point is that post-traumatic stress disorder , or @entity33 , affects not just the immediate victims of violence , whether in war or the result of crime , but also bystanders and witnesses			2
another discovery is that brain trauma causes abnormal activity in at least three areas of the brain			1
the amygdala , responsible for emotions , is over-activated			1
the hippocampus , responsible for short - term memory , starts to recycle the traumatic event obsessively			2
the prefrontal cortex , especially in the area that mediates emotions , becomes weaker			1
opinion : to help kids with tragedy , slow down , listen the overall result is that you ca n't stop reliving the traumatic event and feeling its impact , while your ability to get past your emotions is lessened			1
we 've all experienced the ptsd state of the brain through mass tragedies like the attacks on 9/11			1
the symptoms are familiar , yet neuroscience allows us to see that healing consists of getting out of the pattern just described			1
throwing yourself back into the traumatic event only increases the symptoms			1
an event like @entity7 creates suffering			2
suffering can be defined as the pain that makes life seem meaningless			2
animals suffer , of course , and often deeply			2
some , like the elephant , are capable of mourning for their kind if one dies			2
humans , however , are subject to complex inner pain that includes fear , guilt , shame , grief , rage and hopelessness			0
september 11 revealed that it was an illusion to think that our society was immune to such suffering			0
that illusion abruptly burst again with @entity7			0
thinking back , i was traveling on 9/11 , and when i landed at a @entity96 airport , i met people beseeching to know what to do about their distress			1
in those first moments , shock was just giving way to tears , so all anyone could do was to try to feel safe again on the most basic level			1
a parents ' promise : i will keep you safe i reflected on my own experiences with grief			0
" hold each other , " i offered			0
" do n't be afraid to ask for contact			0
reach out and tell your loved ones that you do love them			0
do n't let it be taken for granted			0
be with it and allow it to be released naturally			0
grieve with others if you can , alone if you must			0
" these were simple , basic remedies for the immediate reaction of shock			2
grieving is often different for men and women , because men tend not to let their emotions out in front of others as easily as women can			2
men have been taught that it is a sign of weakness to show public emotion , and so feel safer crying alone			0
but for anyone , peering into the brain as we now can do , the physiological story is that trauma disrupts the balance of feeling , memory and decision - making			1
they need time and care to come back into balance			1
studies have shown that even in the face of tragedy , and despite the fact that a memory may be indelible , emotional balance for many victims can return to normal states within two years			1
this is cause for hope			0
when terrible things happen : helping children heal after shock and numbness , the second stage is that powerful emotions rise to the surface , often after being buried for years or decades			1
all around us we see rage and sorrow starting to erupt			0
( president @entity167 's call for an end to gun massacres expresses emotions that are strong today but will be tested tomorrow when politicians face the @entity172 and begin to calculate the odds of getting re-elected if a powerful lobby opposes them			1
) at the same time , over-sensitivity sets in because the brain 's control mechanisms are weak			1
the most common incidents -- the slam of a door , a car backfiring , a surprise tap on the shoulder -- can cause a panic reaction			0
in ensuing days , this unguarded anxiety can begin to spread like a contagion			0
the third stage of suffering comes when you face your inner wound and either move to heal it , strike out against your symptoms , or choose denial			0
each person affected by a trauma usually falls into a confused mixture of all three responses			2
but the most basic choice is whether to keep suffering or alleviate it			0
for the sake of bringing suffering to an end after @entity7 , we should pause over the choices that everyone can make as an aid to healing : hold each other in loving awareness			2
resist viewing negative images over and over			1
walk away when the conversation contains negativity			0
keep your life as structured as possible -- this is especially true when dealing with children in the aftermath of tragedy			1
try not to be alone -- eat meals as a family , allow friends to offer consolation even when being around others is painful			0
forgive yourself when you feel like a victim , but take steps to grow out of victim thinking			0
allow for someone else 's point of view			0
it is difficult to express inner pain , and we all do it imperfectly			0
what may seem like anger and frustration from others is often the best they can do			0
because it reaches so deep , your sense of suffering may be subtle , like a gray fog rather than a sharp physical wound			0
to truly judge how healing is progressing , it is important to do more than regain everyday normality			2
become involved in your own healing , let time be your ally , and go as deeply as you can into the reservoir of peace that lies inside you			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity252 .			1

@entity252 : we delay healing when we obsess over details of a tragedy
@entity252 : trauma disrupts the balance of the brain and it needs time to come back
after shock , powerful emotions rise that the brain has difficulty dealing with , he says
@entity252 : you need to resist negative images , seek companionship , speak gently
