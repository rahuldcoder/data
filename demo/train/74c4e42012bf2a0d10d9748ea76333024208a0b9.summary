@entity0 and @entity1 have been together since high school			1
she went to his senior prom ; he went to her junior and senior proms			1
they got married in october 2008			2
he never said anything about her being overweight			2
when @entity1 , an @entity11 specialist , was deployed to @entity12 for a year in 2012 , @entity0 decided she wanted to get in shape			1
she weighed about 260 pounds when he left , and less than 155 pounds when he returned			1
" i just sat in bed one night and was like , ' i can do this , ' " she said			2
" ' i need to do this			2
' " @entity1 , now 25 and living in @entity18 , @entity19 , has struggled with her weight her whole life , even as a child			1
each time she had tried dieting in the past , she would relapse			2
before she became pregnant with her daughter , @entity25 , she took diet pills and lost 60 pounds			1
but all that -- and more -- came back after she stopped taking the pills			2
at her heaviest , she weighed around 300 pounds			1
she 's 5 feet 6 inches tall			1
" i would eat when i was bored			2
i 'd eat three huge meals a day , and then snack in between			2
sad or happy , i 'd turn to food for everything			2
" @entity1 felt tired all the time			2
she wanted to surprise her husband , and work toward a better life for herself and her family			1
her primary mission : cut out all the junk			0
she stopped drinking soda , and tried to limit her liquids to water and coffee			0
upwave : try it now ! no fast food for a week the first three to four months were the hardest , she said			0
once she got past that , she started craving more healthy foods and water			1
it got to the point where , if she drank a diet soda , it made her so thirsty that she did n't even want it			0
@entity1 's job presented its own challenges ; she 's a personal shopper at a supermarket			1
at lunch time , the hot fried chicken " just smells so good , " she said			0
but the supermarket also offers a large , well - kept salad bar , as well as warm vegetables on the hot bar and oven - baked chicken			0
a typical breakfast for @entity1 is oatmeal with fruit or a cereal bar			0
on her days off , she 'll cook up sausage , eggs or pancakes , but she 'll watch her portion size			0
around 10 a.m. she has a snack , such as fruit or carrots			0
lunch is a salad or half a sandwich with some kind of vegetable or fruit			0
an afternoon snack might be yogurt			0
for dinner , she eats a lean meat ( like ground turkey or a boneless , skinless chicken breast ) , a vegetable and a very small portion of starch			0
the big day , @entity1 's return , was may 15 , 2013			1
the soldier had never seen his wife weigh less than 220 pounds , even in high school			1
when she saw him at the airport , @entity98 did n't know what to say or do			1
she just ran and jumped into his arms			0
her husband was speechless , uttering only one word : " wow			1
" it was the first time he had ever picked her up			0
before , he had n't been able to lift her off the ground even a little , she said			0
that moment was worth everything			0
" a lot of people look at it like , ' why is that such a big deal ? ' " she said			0
" but ( when ) you never thought you 'd see that moment , that somebody can pick you up ... it is a big deal			0
" the other big part of the surprise : she had bought a new house while he was away			0
since then , @entity1 has been able to keep the weight off			1
when her husband left she was a size 22 to 24 ; now she can wear a women 's size 6			1
she 's especially loving how much money she saves on smaller clothes			1
khakis , for example , used to cost $ 80 , but she found a pair for her new physique for only $ 7			0
she said her husband 's eating habits have n't changed much ; he likes her cooking , but he 'll help himself to ice cream or cake afterward			1
sometimes she will join him			0
but she 's not too tempted to go back to her old ways of eating			1
" i 've seen how hard i worked , and what i had to go through to get to this point , " she said			0
she 's still in disbelief when her husband picks her up .			1

@entity98 's husband was deployed to @entity12
in may 2013 she met him at the airport , more than 100 pounds *lighter*
she *focused* on healthy eating during her weight loss
