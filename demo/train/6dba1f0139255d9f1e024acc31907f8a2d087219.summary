@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 just did @entity4 and @entity5 a big favor			1
it showed the two minority groups most impacted by affirmative action the writing on the wall and prodded them to end their crippling dependence on a program that , while intended to help them when it was designed a half - century ago , now arguably does them harm			1
on the surface , with its lopsided 7 - to - 1 ruling in @entity19 v. the @entity20 , the @entity3 resolved to do not that much			1
the justices ducked the weightier constitutional concerns involved in the issue of whether colleges and universities can take an applicant 's race or ethnicity into account			1
but they did scold the lower courts for their handling of the case and demand that they give the facts and the law another look			1
writing for the majority , justice @entity38 pointed out that the @entity3 had previously set a standard of " strict scrutiny " -- by which the burden lies on institutions of higher learning to show that they could n't have gotten where they wanted to go in terms of achieving a diverse student body by using " race - neutral alternatives			1
" the lower courts did n't hold the @entity20 to that standard , @entity38 said , and so they need a do - over			2
the court 's four most conservative justices agreed with @entity38 , but so did justices @entity57 and @entity59 , who are more liberal			1
let 's give the majority of the justices some credit for not getting too carried way with the notion of victimhood			2
they could have suggested , along with justice @entity68 , that @entity19 -- the onetime applicant to the @entity20 who was at the center of the case -- is the modern - day equivalent of those african - americans who , in the pre-civil rights era , were routinely discriminated against and denied admission to colleges and universities because of their race			1
@entity68 essentially compared what the @entity20 does now to what the @entity81 was doing in 1963			2
seriously ? here 's what really happened in the @entity85			2
when @entity19 applied in 2008 , the university set aside three - fourths of its available slots to students who graduated in the top 10 % of their high school classes			2
( today , it 's 8 %			2
) @entity19 's academics were n't strong enough to get her into that category ; she graduated in the top 12 %			2
and rather than admit that she should have earned better grades , she got angry with the university which doled out other slots under a process that weighed several factors including race and socioeconomic status			0
after all , a diverse state deserves a diverse class of leaders			0
@entity85 is 12 % african - american and 38 % @entity106 while the student body at @entity20 -- with its 52,000 students -- is just 4.5 % african - american and 18 % @entity106			0
curiously , @entity19 blamed the university 's policy -- rather than her own academic shortcomings -- for not getting into the @entity20			0
and then , she filed a lawsuit			0
she found her way to @entity115 , and the case bearing her name quickly found its way to the @entity3 , where it was welcomed onto the docket by five justices who were already itching to strike down affirmative action			1
despite what @entity68 would like to believe , @entity19 is no victim			0
had she worked a little harder in high school , she might have gotten into college on " the 10 % rule " and saved us all a lot of drama			0
besides , are n't conservatives the ones who are always talking about merit ? yet , here they went to bat for mediocrity			0
it is simply not the case that white people are -- in the admissions process -- being subjected to some wholesale form of discrimination because they have long been considered inferior due to skin color			0
they do n't need to link arms and sing : " @entity145			0
" now , if you want to see real victims , look at @entity5 and @entity106 students who are being shortchanged by the public school system because those who teach them harbor low expectations			0
this is one of the most serious problems with racial and ethnic preferences -- that they camouflage what are often severe educational inequalities at the critical k - 12 level			0
they can also lower standards , kill incentive , provide a crutch , attach a stigma to beneficiaries , and perpetuate a destructive spoils system that benefits a few at the expense of the many			0
these programs should have come with an expiration date			0
it 's been more than 50 years since president @entity173 signed -- on march 6 , 1961 -- @entity174 , instructing @entity176 government contractors to take " affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed , and that employees are treated during employment , without regard to their race , creed , color , or national origin			1
" my parents ' generation suffered real discrimination , and so it made sense to give it a leg up through affirmative action			1
but it makes no sense to transfer that privilege to my children , who are being raised with every advantage			1
when that sort of thing happens , it only makes the public more cynical and bitter			0
the @entity3 gave affirmative action in college and university admissions a reprieve this week , but it wo n't last long			1
the justices have another case on their docket for the fall			0
latinos and african - americans have the chance to end their dependence on a program that is taking them nowhere , and the rest of us can focus on fixing a broken educational system so that more students of color can succeed on the natural and go anywhere they want to go			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			1

@entity227 says affirmative action ruling is a signal
he says court requiring universities to demonstrate justification for the program
@entity227 : a generation ago , affirmative action was needed to *remedy* *wrongs*
he says his children are being raised with every advantage
