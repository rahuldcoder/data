@entity0 , @entity1 -- on the blank canvas left behind by last year 's tornado , new homes are slowly popping up in @entity0 , @entity1			1
every few blocks the buzz of power saws and the pop - pop - pop of nail guns from construction crews signal another step toward making the city whole again			2
" @entity0 is on the mend , " said mayor @entity14			1
" we have a long road to travel , but the way that everyone is joining together and unifying and chipping in , we 're going to make it			2
" what @entity0 needs now a year ago , the city suffered a direct hit by a massive @entity26 tornado with wind speeds over 200 mph			1
the may 22 twister leveled homes and businesses , killing 161 people			1
" a third of the city got pretty much destroyed by the tornado , " @entity32 said			1
" total devastation , a war zone , that 's what it looked like to me			1
" after the search and rescue finished , the cleanup began			2
most of the 3 million cubic yards of debris left by the tornado was removed in the first few months after the storm , leaving behind an eerie , treeless tableau			1
after devastating tornado , @entity1 hospital to be demolished in the middle of this destruction , the iconic cross at @entity52 still stands , giving hope to many in @entity0			1
father @entity57 was in his quarters behind the church watching a golf tournament on television when the storm hit			0
he took shelter in his bathroom as the church and rectory were leveled			0
" i was praying at a high speed , " said the priest , known to his parishioners as father @entity57			0
" i did n't expect from the noise coming at me that i was going to survive in any manner			0
i certainly was praying , and i was just praying to ask @entity73 to accept his will			0
" @entity57 moved to the @entity75 in the 1960s , but he still speaks with a lilting @entity78 brogue			0
he has been the pastor of @entity52 for 12 years and has seen storms come and go , but nothing like the magnitude of last year 's tornado			1
when he emerged from the rubble , he saw that one of the few things still standing was the cross			0
" i just looked and i thought , @entity73 is really with us , and he 's letting us know he 's going to take care of us , " he said			1
it was a real gift to see that and it became a symbol all over the community , in fact all over the world			0
" his flock has been attending services at a neighboring church while construction begins a few miles away on the new @entity52			0
the location of the old church will be the site of an electrical substation , but the cross will remain and become part of a small park			0
@entity108 share their experiences from @entity0 @entity57 said he still visits the cross many mornings to pray and meditate at dawn			1
" your @entity73 is alive and well			0
and we do n't always know why these things happen , but thanks for giving us a message of unity , " he prays			0
the cross sits on high ground overlooking the mixed recovery in @entity0			1
@entity121 now holds a beautiful fountain and memorial to those lost in the tornado , along with basketball courts and playgrounds			1
across the street from the park is the wreckage of @entity131 , which still looks much the way it did in the days immediately after the storm , with blown - out windows and collapsed walls			0
demolition is under way on the heavily damaged hospital , but it is the tallest building in the area , making it impossible to forget the epic destruction the tornado brought			1
a new hospital is being built on a site a few miles away			0
about a mile west of @entity52 , the tornado hit @entity148 , which is now a massive pile of rubble behind a chain link fence			1
the school district canceled the remainder of the 2011 school year and set to work trying to figure out what to do with its students when summer was over			1
school officials settled on a unique solution : they would construct a temporary school in the vacant end of a shopping mall and use it for several years until a new school could be built			0
after a frantic summer of planning and building , they managed to open the makeshift school on time in september 2011			1
@entity0 student 's blog post it took the students and teachers awhile to get used to having classes in a mall , watching senior citizen mall walkers pass by the cafeteria doors during lunch			1
now , as the seniors get ready for graduation , it feels like a real school			2
there is an uncommon maturity to the students at @entity148			1
two students from the school died , many others lost their homes , and all are part of a battered and bruised community			2
" we get support from each other and our teachers , " explained @entity192 , an 18 - year - old senior			0
" and it just helps us grow stronger and stronger , so i think it 's good we 're here together			2
" the tornado destroyed her family 's home , along with all her possessions , including clothes and jewelry			1
" i know it 's changed me a lot as a person whether i like it or not , " she said			2
" i do n't care as much about material possessions			0
now it 's like , whatever , and it 's made me value friendships			2
" she is excited to have president @entity214 speak at her graduation and , like many in @entity0 , she does n't dwell on what happened here			1
but , she says , when a storm approaches it 's hard to forget			2
to ease students ' minds and protect them in the event of another tornado , the school has erected concrete storm shelters in the parking lot			1
each student is assigned a shelter and the school holds regular drills to be sure they can evacuate in a matter of minutes			0
many @entity0 residents struggle with the fear of another devastating storm striking the town			1
@entity236 lost everything in last year 's tornado , salvaging only a few photos of her sons after seeing them posted on @entity242			1
today , she keeps them in a concrete - reinforced closet with a steel door			2
" this is just like having a lock box , and i know that i 'm not going to lose these photos again , " she said			0
" i can replace anything that i can go to a store and buy , but i can never replace any of these things			0
" @entity252 now lives in a brand - new house full of newly purchased furniture			0
her neighborhood is only partly rebuilt and backhoes are as common on the streets as cars			0
she tries to not dwell on the tornado and all that she and her family have been through , but like @entity192 , she gets nervous when a storm rolls in			2
" i get tense , edgy , just kind of anxious , " she said			0
" there 's always going to be that fear of it happening again , and my biggest struggle is trying to not show fear for my children			2
" she is eager for the anniversary to come and go and for the rebuilding to be complete			2
" i 'm proud of @entity0			1
we have a long way to go , " she said			0
" seeing it every day you just want it over , want it done , want it fixed			0
