the @entity1 separatist group @entity0 announced thursday a " definitive cessation of its armed activity " in a statement published on the website of @entity6 , a newspaper that the group has used to convey messages in the past			1
listed as a terrorist organization by @entity12 , the @entity13 and the @entity14 , @entity0 is blamed for hundreds of deaths in its decades - long fight for an independent @entity1 state that it wants carved out of sections of northern @entity12 and southwestern @entity20			1
thursday 's announcement follows a recent push for the group to abandon violence permanently			0
that effort was led by international figures who include @entity29 leader @entity28 of @entity30 and former @entity32 secretary - general @entity31			0
in a nationally televised address hours after the announcement was posted , prime minister @entity33 termed @entity0 's announcement as being of " transcendental importance " and a " victory for democracy			1
" " ours will be a democracy without terrorism , but not without memory , " @entity33 said , referring to 829 people killed by @entity0 and their families			0
the prime minister praised @entity12 police , @entity48 personnel , the intelligence agency and judicial authorities " who have contributed to this end			2
" @entity33 also singled out @entity20 -- which has traditionally been used as a rearguard base for @entity0 -- and its president , @entity54 , for their assistance			0
the prime minister said that it would be up to @entity12 's next government -- which will be formed after parliamentary elections on november 20 -- to lead the peace process			1
@entity33 , whose popular standing has soured amid @entity12 's deep economic crisis , is not running for a third term			1
soon after he was first elected , in 2004 , the police intensified their crackdown on @entity0 as the group 's popularity among some segments of @entity1 society began to wane			1
in its own statement thursday , @entity0 called of " enormous significance " a one - day meeting held monday in which @entity28 , @entity31 and other leaders met in @entity76 , a principal @entity1 city , and called for peace			2
after that conference -- which did not include representatives from the @entity12 government , the @entity1 regional government or the main opposition party in @entity12 , the @entity78 -- former @entity80 prime minister @entity79 read a statement calling for @entity0 to issue a declaration akin to what it made on thursday			1
the leaders also called on the @entity12 and @entity20 governments to welcome it and " agree to talks exclusively to deal with the consequences of the conflict			0
" @entity95 president @entity94 hailed @entity0 's move friday as " a truly historic moment which ends years of terror and attacks on @entity12 society			1
" the development " marks the culmination of years of unceasing efforts in the fight against terrorism , " he said , as he congratulated @entity12 on its efforts to combat @entity0			2
police have cracked down in recent years on @entity0 in @entity12 and @entity20 , leaving it operationally weak			2
there have been numerous statements from the @entity1 group calling for talks or a peace process of some sort , but all falling short of declaring a definitive end to violence			1
the @entity12 government has said that since @entity0 has broken cease - fires in the past , only an authoritative statement that it is putting down its arms for good will do			2
in its statement thursday , the group outlined why now was the right time to make such a declaration			0
" a new political time is emerging in the @entity1 , " @entity0 said			1
" we have a historic opportunity to find a just and democratic solution for the centuries - old political conflict			0
" the group then added that " dialogue and agreement " should predominate " over violence and repression			0
" @entity0 urged the @entity12 and @entity20 governments to conduct " direct dialogue " aimed at addressing outstanding issues , while calling upon fellow @entity137 to commit to such a process			2
in remarks thursday night at their respective political party headquarters in @entity142 , the two main contenders to replace @entity33 cheered the development but did not detail what they would do next if they were to become prime minister			0
@entity146 , the candidate from @entity33 's @entity147 who until recently as @entity12 's interior minister led the fight against @entity0 , said the announcement " puts an end to decades of broken lives			1
" he called unity among @entity12 parties and leaders the " key to this victory , " and urged that this unified stance continue			0
" today , the @entity0 is not the protagonist , because the state of law has won , " @entity146 said			0
soon after , @entity162 -- who opinion polls show holds a commanding lead heading into next month 's elections -- said that members of his conservative @entity78 take " satisfaction " from @entity0 's decision , which he insisted was not spurred by any political concessions			1
@entity162 called the announcement " an important step , " while adding that @entity12 would rest fully " only when there is the definitive dissolution " of @entity0			2
@entity174 , the president of the @entity175 , offered a similar stance in stating that her group will be satisfied only when @entity0 " turns in its guns and disbands			0
" this sentiment was echoed by the leader of the moderate @entity181 , @entity182 , who likewise called on the group to " disarm and disband			0

@entity95 chief @entity94 hails a " truly historic moment "
@entity12 's two top prime ministerial candidates call @entity0 's move a " victory "
the @entity1 separatist group announces a " definitive cessation of its armed activity "
@entity0 calls for talks , saying " a new political time is emerging in the @entity1 "
