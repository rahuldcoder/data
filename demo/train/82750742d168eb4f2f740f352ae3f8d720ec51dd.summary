-- every day @entity1 was on the verge of making @entity4 history			1
every day he fell just a little bit short			0
but it mattered not , as the veteran @entity7 led from start to finish to become only the fourth player to win the @entity10 three times			1
it did n't matter that his putt for a magical 59 lipped out in thursday 's opening round			0
it did n't matter that he missed the @entity7 circuit 's 36 - hole scoring record after a double - bogey on friday			1
and making the second best 54 - hole total on saturday was not a problem either -- it put him six shots clear going into the home straight			2
a final - round 67 was his worst of the tournament and left him on 28 - under - par 256 overall , the joint second - best 72 - hole total in @entity4 history -- matching the mark set by fellow three - time winner @entity30 at the same tournament in 2001			1
the 42 - year - old came off the course at @entity35 beaming , having earned his 41st @entity4 title ahead of next week 's defense of his crown at the @entity39 -- the scene of his 40th win			1
" i played really good golf , " @entity1 said after claiming the $ 1 million first prize and moving into ninth place on the @entity4 's all - time win list			1
" this is how i 've been playing for a while and it feels really good to get that golf out of me when i 'm at a big tournament			0
" @entity1 , who also credited his new driver for his upswing in fortunes , is targeting a fourth @entity54 victory in april			2
" it 's important to start building momentum but it 's more important what you do closer to @entity60 , " @entity1 said			1
" you have got to deal with some of the greatest pressure you will ever deal with at @entity60			0
" @entity1 has now won a @entity4 title in each of the past 10 years , the most of any active player			1
he has won a tournament in 20 different years , including in 1991 as an amateur -- putting him behind only @entity67 ( 24 years of wins ) and @entity69 ( 21 )			2
his closest challenger at @entity35 , @entity71 , got within three shots but a dropped shot at the last extended @entity1 's winning margin			1
" to be in the last group with @entity1 and kind of trade birdie for birdie and make up some ground was a lot of fun , " said @entity71 , who was also second behind @entity75 at @entity76 last weekend			1
" it 's what we play for			0
i wish i could have put some more pressure on him and got a little closer than i did today , but i think i shot 12 under par on the weekend and made one bogey			0
" sometimes you have to tip your hat and say @entity1 played unbelievable and deserved to win , and that 's kind of what this week was all about			2
" @entity96 closed with 61 to be third on 23 under , one shot ahead of fellow @entity7 @entity98 ( 65 ) , while @entity99 carded 62 for fifth on 19 under			2

" it 's taken a long time but it 's sweeter now			0
i 'm maturing with age hopefully ! " said @entity100 , who fired a crucial eagle at the 16th hole -- his fifth of the week -- to move clear .			0

@entity1 wins for the first time in a year at the @entity10 in @entity123
