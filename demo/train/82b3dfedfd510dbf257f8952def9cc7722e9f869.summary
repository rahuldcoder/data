-- months after ruling that @entity2 must recognize same - sex marriages performed in other states , a federal judge decided tuesday that the state must conduct them as well			1
@entity8 district judge @entity7 on tuesday ruled that @entity2 's same - sex marriage ban is unconstitutional , saying it violates the @entity8 @entity12 's guarantee of equal protection under the law			1
@entity7 's decision -- like his earlier one -- will not go into immediate effect at least until the 6th @entity19 rules on the matter			1
the state appealed the first case , and @entity2 's governor indicated tuesday the state also will appeal the latest ruling			1
@entity7 ruled thursday in a case brought by two same - sex couples who argued the state 's law violated their rights			1
" ultimately , @entity2 's laws banning same - sex marriage can not withstand constitutional review , " @entity7 wrote in a 19 - page opinion			1
he cited in part the @entity37 's decision last year to strike down a federal law known as the @entity39 , which had denied legally married same - sex couples the same federal benefits , including tax breaks , available to heterosexual couples			2
" assuring equal protection for same - sex couples does not diminish the freedom of others to any degree , " @entity7 wrote			0
the office of @entity2 gov. @entity50 said the state would appeal tuesday 's ruling , like @entity7 's earlier decision , " so that the matter is fully before the @entity55			1
" in february , @entity7 ruled that @entity2 's refusal to recognize out - of - state same - sex marriages violates the 14th @entity60 's equal protection clause , the same rationale he used tuesday , @entity50 , a @entity62 , hired outside lawyers to defend the out - of - state ban , after his attorney general tearfully refused in march to take part in any further legal challenges			0
@entity50 contended that " @entity2 should be part of this process " until the @entity37 weighs in			0
@entity70 , the lead attorney for the plaintiffs in tuesday 's case , said her clients were elated but still " looking forward to that day when they can wed. " " we regret that the commonwealth will spend more money on this appeal at certainly an unnecessary taxpayers ' expense , but we 're glad that ( @entity50 has ) already made the decision so we can continue to fight , " she said			2
with dozens of cases working their way through the court systems , more district judges could issue their own decisions affecting yet more states until the @entity37 weighs in further			0
