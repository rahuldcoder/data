-- president @entity1 took his renewed jobs push beyond the @entity4 beltway again tuesday , heading to the politically critical state of @entity6 for a town hall meeting			1
the president used the event to spotlight his call for a $ 30 billion investment in a new small - business lending fund			1
@entity1 's initiative would recycle $ 30 billion of the remaining @entity14 funds into a government lending program offering cheap capital to community banks that boost their small - business lending this year			1
this measure will help ensure " small businesses are once again the engine of job growth in @entity24 , " @entity1 said in the city of @entity26			2
it 's " absolutely critical that @entity28 acts " to help pass this and other job creation legislation			0
while credit conditions for large businesses have improved over the past year , small companies are still widely reporting problems finding the capital they need to fund their operations			2
since small businesses employ about half of @entity24 workers , policymakers worry that the ongoing credit crunch they face is contributing to the nation 's high rate of job losses			0
under @entity1 's plan , banks with assets of less than $ 10 billion would be able to borrow money from the @entity50 at a dividend rate as low as 1 percent if they use the cash to make more small - business loans this year than they did in 2009			1
@entity1 's visit to @entity6 , several political analysts said , was part of the @entity59 's ongoing effort to recapture sorely needed political momentum			1
the state , which is home to the first - in - the - nation presidential primary , is considered in many ways to be a political bellwether for an administration struggling to maintain the support of independent voters			2
more than 40 percent of the state 's voters were registered as independents as of last november , according to the @entity6 secretary of state 's office			2
@entity1 easily carried the state in the 2008 general election , but a slight plurality of @entity6 voters disapproved of his job performance in a december 2009 @entity78 survey			1
tuesday 's trip was @entity1 's second visit to @entity6 since becoming president			2
while the town hall participants gave his small - business proposal a warm reception , they also raised questions about a series of other issues , including education , energy independence , government transparency and health care reform			1
" we 're in the red zone			0
we 've got to punch it through , " @entity1 said about the stalled health care legislation			1
" i do not quit			0
we are going to get that done			0
" @entity1 said supporters of the legislation " have to move methodically and [ ensure ] the @entity24 people understand exactly what 's in the bill			0
" efforts to pass a comprehensive reform bill have been frozen since @entity105 sen. - elect @entity104 won the seat previously held by @entity107 , who died last august			0
@entity104 's victory stripped @entity109 of their 60 - seat @entity111 supermajority and gave @entity112 enough votes to block most bills			0
@entity0 's @entity115 and @entity116 contributed to this report .			0
