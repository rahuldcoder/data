@entity7 is the northeastern @entity8 state that borders @entity9 , a diverse place whose reputation is overshadowed by violence carried out by rival drug cartels			1

" what has declined in the past years are the illegal roadblocks and the very large shootouts , but the criminal control remains the same , or stronger			0
" the administration of former president @entity93 , who left office in 2012 , attributed the violence in @entity7 to a turf war between the @entity97 cartel and the @entity99 cartel over control of drug smuggling routes to the @entity102			2
to combat them , in 2010 he launched an operation that sent additional security forces to @entity7 and the neighboring @entity108 state			0
