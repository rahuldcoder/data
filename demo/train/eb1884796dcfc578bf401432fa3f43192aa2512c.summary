" i 'm here because this is something that 's close to my heart , " said @entity13			1

" i felt i had a huge debt to this country that 's given me so much , " @entity13 said			1
" when i heard the law that passed , i could n't believe it			2
because the @entity56 i know , freedom , liberties we enjoy , are for everyone and then this law passes and i 'm like ' wow			2
' it 's a shame ; it 's a state that does n't even want you here ? if i take this uniform off i 'm just another person who came here illegally			2
" just six hours before shipping off , @entity13 's family and friends gathered for a farewell feast			1
the @entity77 barbecue could be smelled a block away			0
impassioned conversation about the controversial law could be heard over the scratching of forks and knives on plates of tangy barbecue			0

" but it 's my duty to go			0
" " you 're @entity77 , " @entity86 said			0

@entity13 wondered if some of his family members or friends , some of whom are undocumented , would still be in @entity48 when he returned			1
