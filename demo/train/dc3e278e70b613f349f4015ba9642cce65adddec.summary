" he always worried about the destiny of the @entity36 people and it was clear for the @entity36 people to survive in this world you have to stand up and fight , " said his senior adviser @entity31			2
to his opponents though , like @entity41 legislator @entity40 , he was merely a bulldozer in a china shop			2
" @entity45 was the most bloodiest of @entity3 's leaders			1
no scruples , no compunction -- killing people , men women children , destroying homes , destroying trees and crops , stealing land			2
" born on a farm outside @entity57 on february 26 , 1928 , the son of @entity60 immigrants , @entity45 took the lessons from working the land to the highest office in @entity3			1
" when my father saw that i was tired , " @entity45 recalled in 2001 , " he would stop for a minute and say ' look how much we have done already			1
' so from time to time i try and think how much we have done already			2
" he served bravely during @entity3 's war of @entity70 and the dashing paratrooper quickly rose through the ranks , well liked by @entity3 's founding fathers			1

in 1953 , after a wave of terrorist attacks from @entity88 , he established and commanded the infamous @entity89 , assigned to carry out reprisals			2
one of those missions was a raid on the border town of @entity94 , in which 45 houses were blown up and 69 @entity97 villagers killed			0
@entity45 said he thought the houses were empty			1
by june 1967 , he was back at war , now a general , leading his tank battalion to a crushing victory over the @entity103 in the @entity104 during the @entity105			0
but what he considered his greatest military achievement came during the 1973 @entity108 when a surprise attack by a coalition of @entity97 states led by @entity103 and @entity112 prompted @entity45 to defy his command by surrounding @entity103 's @entity114 and leading his troops over the @entity116			1
it was a turning point in the war			0
" he was the kind of commander when the going was tough -- uncertainty and casualties -- soldiers always looked up to him to give guidance , to be like their guiding light in the dark , " observed @entity31			0
" he was against all those notions of command from the rear			0
he said the commander must be on top of it with his troops on the front line			0
" retiring from the army , he turned to politics			0
as a member of the conservative @entity139 party , he served in several @entity3 administrations			1
he was the father of the settlements -- jewish communities built on occupied @entity41 land -- condemned internationally , and seen as an obstacle to peace by many within @entity3			1
" that is the land of @entity3 and we are going to stay there forever , " @entity45 declared defiantly			1
as defense minister he was the architect of @entity3 's disastrous 1982 war in @entity152 , ordering the invasion to stop the @entity154 from using @entity152 as a base for attacks on @entity3			1
" this was a misadventure , an ill - fated invasion , " commented political analyst @entity157			0
" @entity45 was trying to play superpower here and re-arrange the region in a way that would help @entity3			1
" and in 1983 , an @entity3 tribunal found him indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of @entity41 at @entity169 refugee camps in @entity152			1
it was carried out by the @entity172 militia group , @entity3 's allies , and @entity45 was found to have done nothing to stop it			1
he was forced to resign and was banned from ever being defense minister , a punishment that rankled even with the thick - skinned @entity45			1
" he felt betrayed , he felt betrayed by government , " said @entity31			0
in the @entity97 world they called him the @entity181 of @entity182			0
" he was resented , hated , he had not only blood on his hands he had a trail of blood everywhere he went , " said @entity40			0
" @entity45 was the most bloodiest of @entity3 leaders			1
" the 1990s would see his political rehabilitation , eventually becoming leader of his party in 1999			2
in september of that year came his notorious visit to the @entity193 -- the holiest site for @entity36 , also claimed by @entity194 as @entity193 , the " @entity193			0
" violence soon erupted ; @entity41 claim it was the spark that brought about the @entity196 or uprising			0
" you do n't bring thousands of border guards and police onto the @entity193 ground at a time when it is clear that the situation was simmering ... was a powder keg ready to erupt , " said @entity40			0
but historian @entity74 said there was more to the move than met the eye			0
" @entity45 's visit to the @entity193 had been co-ordinated with the @entity210 at the time			1
they knew about it , there was no surprise about it ; they were simply waiting for him to go up to intiate their terrorist war			0
" in the violence that followed , @entity45 was elected prime minister ; and @entity3 again turned to the @entity27 , who promised to bring peace and security			1
later he was asked how he managed such a remarkable comeback from the political grave			0
" maybe they try to bury me too early , " he told @entity0 , laughing , " and ah , maybe not deep enough -- what can i tell you ? " as a wave of suicide bombings rocked @entity3 , @entity45 unleashed the @entity3 military , sending tanks and troops into @entity41 towns , ordering assassinations of @entity41 militant leaders			1
" and believe me , we show restraint			0
i am under heavy pressure to act differently			0
" palestinians of course , had a different view			2
" i think @entity45 will be seen in history as the one who has perpetrated the must cruelty on the @entity41 , " said @entity40			1
@entity45 ordered the construction of the barrier through the @entity250 and confined @entity41 leader @entity251 to his compound in @entity253 -- accusing him of encouraging attacks on @entity3			1
in 2001 , he told @entity0 , " no doubt @entity251 is a terrorist			0
" previously he had said he always regretted not killing his old foe when he had the chance			0
but @entity157 said @entity45 's decision was made out of fear of what might have happened			1
" i think @entity45 only refrained from killing @entity251 reluctantly only because of a promise he made to the @entity262 government that he would n't kill him and because of an assessment by some in the @entity3 intelligence community that more @entity36 would die if @entity251 was killed			1
" as the violence continued , @entity3 overwhelmingly re-elected him for a second term in january 2003			1
not long after @entity45 made an historic announcement : @entity3 would give up @entity36 settlements in @entity271 and part of the @entity250			1
@entity45 sent in the police and army to drag settlers from their homes , a move that earned him plaudits overseas , but derision and death threats from the settlers who once saw him as their champion			2
a small group of political rebels stirred up trouble within @entity139 , and by the end of 2005 , @entity45 had had enough			2
he bolted from his party , and established a new centrist group , called @entity291 , @entity292 for " forward			0
" early opinion polls showed @entity45 on track for a third term in office , but the man who many had thought was unstoppable , unexpectedly suffered a mild stroke in december 18 , 2005			2
characteristically , he tried to brush over his illness			0
" he felt he had to come as quickly as he could smiling on his own two feet , " commented analyst @entity157 , " otherwise he would be a political lame duck			0
" two weeks later , he was back in the same intensive care unit at @entity302 in @entity303 , after suffering a second stroke -- but this time it was more serious			0
he underwent three emergency operations in 24 hours when doctors later tried to wake him from the medically induced coma			0
there were some signs of life -- slight movement of his hands and legs -- but little else			0
he has remained in a coma ever since			0
questions were asked : did the prime minister receive the best medical treatment , why did he rush back to work after the first stroke ? eventually though , well - wishers and news crews left the hospital , the business of government resumed , and @entity3 accepted that @entity45 was not coming back .			1

@entity45 was a force in @entity3 for decades
many @entity3 saw him as a fearless leader
palestinians viewed him as *ruthless*
