the fallout from the @entity3 foundation 's decision not to renew funding for some @entity6 projects has led to threatened resignations , angry press statements and a letter from @entity10			1
now the mayor of @entity12 has gotten involved			0
@entity12 mayor @entity14 announced that he is giving a $ 250,000 matching gift to the @entity6 to help make up for the loss of funding announced tuesday by the @entity3 for the @entity18 , his office said thursday			1
" politics have no place in health care , " the mayor said in a statement			0
" breast cancer screening saves lives , and hundreds of thousands of women rely on @entity6 for access to care			1
we should be helping women access that care , not placing barriers in their way			0
" he was referring to @entity6 's announcement tuesday that the @entity3 had " succumbed to political pressure " by cutting its funding for breast cancer screenings at @entity6 amid increased scrutiny by @entity39 over how @entity6 provides abortion services			1
@entity14 's gift comes on top of the $ 400,000 that @entity6 reported raising online from 6,000 donors the first 24 hours after the announcement			1
@entity6 's loss attracted moral support when @entity47 , which describes itself as the largest corporate donor to @entity6 , announced thursday that 250,000 of its members had signed a petition urging the @entity3 to reverse its decision			1
" the move is clearly connected to attempts by @entity56 in @entity39 to defund @entity6 , " the organization said in a statement			1
" in responding to questions about its decision , the foundation cited as its rationale a sham ' investigation ' into @entity6 launched by @entity63 rep. @entity63 as one of the most militant anti-choice members of @entity39			1
" in september , the @entity66 , on which the @entity68 congressman sits , began an investigation into @entity6 over the organization 's " compliance with federal restrictions on funding abortions			1
" in @entity74 , at least 22 @entity10 signed a letter calling on @entity3 to reconsider its decision			1
" this troubling decision threatens to reduce access to necessary , life - saving services , " it said			0
" it would be tragic if any woman -- let alone thousands of women -- lost access to these potentially life - saving screenings because of a politically motivated attack			0
" " people respond powerfully when they see politics interfering with women 's health , " said @entity85 , spokeswoman for @entity6 , on wednesday			1
" that 's why we 've seen a tremendous outpouring of support			0
" but the @entity93 said in a statement that the @entity3 's decision was justified			1
" @entity6 is currently the focus of a congressional investigation , and multiple affiliates are under state investigations , " it said			1
" @entity6 operatives are lashing out at @entity3 across the @entity102 and throughout the media , in what appears to be a coordinated effort to paint @entity3 's policy as cowardly and politically motivated			1
" the @entity3 denied thursday that its decision stemmed from politics			1
" we 've always had the right to cancel contracts for organizations that came under investigation for potential wrongdoing , " said @entity109 , ceo and founder of the group			0
in all , grants were not renewed to 16 of 19 @entity6 clinics , she said			1
" we do n't base our funding decisions on emotions or politics or whether one side or another will be pleased			2
" @entity109 was a political appointee of the @entity126 administration , in which she served as @entity128 ambassador to @entity129 and as chief of protocol			0
@entity3 was @entity109 's sister			1
@entity3 president @entity133 said the funds will be redirected " to other programs in our communities that can provide these services more directly			1
" she said there was " amazing consensus " among foundation board members about the decision , which was made " over the better part of two years			2
" but that consensus did not include dr. @entity144 , a member of the foundation 's medical advisory board in @entity12 , who said she will resign if the decision is not overturned			2
" i can not as a physician and advocate for women 's health continue to be a part of the organization if it continues in this direction , " @entity144 said			0
" a big part of what @entity3 does is reach underserved communities of women			2
with this decision , they 're not living up to this mission			0
" @entity162 , the group 's managing director of community health programs , left @entity3 this month			2
" it was an honor to oversee and expand their public health efforts during my six years there , " @entity162 said			0
" at the same time , i respect the work of @entity6 , including their lifesaving efforts to detect cancer in its earliest stages			2
the divide between these two very important organizations saddens me			0
" it was n't immediately clear whether she had resigned			0
@entity133 said it 's policy not to release information about employees other than start and end dates			0
@entity185 , executive director of @entity3 's @entity187 chapter , did resign , the foundation said thursday			1
but @entity3 denied that @entity189 's resignation was about the decision			2
" the @entity192 executive director @entity191 did submit her resignation in december 2011 , effective april 1 , 2012			0
her stated reasons did not include the recent grant making criteria changes by @entity3 's global organization that impact @entity6 , " said a statement from @entity195 , president of the @entity187 chapter			1
" we are deeply concerned by implications that there is any correlation			0
" @entity133 said @entity207 ' investigation " has little to do " with the grant decision			0
@entity109 said the " quality of the grants " was a factor			1
" we like to have direct care being given , " she said			0
" we have decided not to fund , wherever possible , pass - through grants			2
in other words , we were giving them money ; they were sending women for mammograms			0
they do not own mammography equipment			0
they do not do these grants within their clinics			2
they just send them out for screening and treatment and diagnosis			0
what we like to have are clinics that we can directly fund			0
" asked how many other grantees provide abortion services , she said , " that 's not something that we ask people about			0
" @entity109 said donations to @entity3 were up 100 % over the past two days			2
@entity6 said that funding from the @entity3 had largely paid for breast exams at local affiliates			1
in the past five years , grants from the group have supported 170,000 screenings , about 4 % of the total exams performed at @entity6 health centers nationwide , according to the group			1
in a statement thursday , the president of @entity6 , @entity248 , expressed gratitude for @entity252 's gift			1
" this contribution will help ensure that politics do n't interfere with women having access to health care , " she said			0
" people all across the country have stepped forward in the last 48 hours to offer help and support , and the mayor 's donation will help ensure that no woman is denied breast cancer services because of right - wing political pressure campaigns			2
" @entity252 , an independent who was first elected mayor as a @entity56 , is founder and majority owner of @entity252 , a multinational financial media company .			2
