@entity0 -- the artwork for " @entity8 , " @entity3 's first album in 10 years and a record that nobody outside his inner circle suspected was coming , is a witty vandalization of the sleeve of 1977 's " heroes			1
" as its designer , @entity12 , explains : the " heroes " cover obscured by the white square is about the spirit of great pop or rock music which is " of the moment , " forgetting or obliterating the past			1
however , we all know that this is never quite the case , no matter how much we try , we can not break free from the past			2

@entity3 's glittering reputation rests on his determination , during his extraordinary run of albums in the 1970s , to escape the past and embrace the future , but he was also clever enough to realize that there 's no such thing as an entirely blank slate , and that tension was the motor of his genius			1
the excitement surrounding his surprise comeback , after a decade of supposed retirement , reminds us that he is rock 's unrivalled innovator - in - chief			2
his early reinventions could perhaps be explained by sheer ambition			0
that 's why @entity3 from suburban @entity49 , on the southern outskirts of @entity0 , became @entity3 ( rhymes with @entity50 , not @entity51 ) and then @entity3 , fearing that 1969 's " @entity53 " would render him a one - hit wonder , became @entity54 , the first post-modern rock star			1
if fame was all he was looking for , he would have been happy with that , but his hunger for change exceeded his appetite for success			0
he killed off @entity3 after just 18 months and unveiled a series of new identities , each with its own sound			1
photos : @entity3 's ever - changing look to listen to all of @entity3 's 70s albums in sequence is still a dizzying experience , because each one attempts to eclipse its predecessor			1
on " @entity74 " he explored the relationship between showbusiness and mental illness			0
" @entity82 " was an apocalyptic vision which spun the mid- 70s ' darkest fears into a kind of glam - rock opera			0
the " plastic soul " of " @entity92 " was his strange response to the sound of black @entity85 and " @entity90 , " recorded in cocaine - maddened seclusion in @entity87 in the guise of the " @entity89 , " presaged his return to @entity94			0
remarkably , these page - turning albums emerged at the rate of around one a year			0
the only possible comparison in terms of creative momentum is the @entity100 , and there were four of them			0
beyond the records themselves , @entity3 's restless eye for new stimuli , drawn from the worlds of cinema , theatre , fashion and visual art , made him pop 's most imaginative stylist			1
@entity0 's @entity115 museum is mounting a major retrospective of his visual work this spring -- rare honor for a pop star			0
read more : @entity3 back after the bonds as the artwork of " he @entity127 " and the lyrics of comeback single " where are we now ? " suggest , @entity3 's mystique resides most powerfully in the three albums he recorded in @entity124 in the late 70s : " @entity130 , " " heroes " and " @entity131			1
" of all his rebirths this was the most radical , influential and multi-faceted			0
the @entity124 albums are perfectly poised between art and pop , containing both avant - garde enigmas like " @entity138 " and glorious , gripping songs like the title track of " heroes , " which sounded not at all out of place , 35 years later , as @entity145 's @entity144 anthem			2
@entity146 , who worked on @entity3 's @entity124 trilogy , once compared rock music to a blank sheet of paper that was rapidly filled in and @entity3 did more than anyone in the 70s to colonize that white space			1
each record was , to quote one song title , a fantastic voyage , alerting other musicians to new possibilities and charting a path for entire scenes			0
it 's impossible to imagine the landscape of early 80s pop , for example , without @entity3 's influence , and you can detect his dna in countless artists , from @entity169 to @entity170 , @entity171 to @entity172 , @entity173 to @entity174 , @entity175 to @entity176			2
to any musician who worries about reconciling artistic integrity with commercial success , or sonic innovation with emotional truth , @entity3 's 70s work is proof that , with enough talent and judgement , you can have it all			2
of course records this good cast a long shadow and , to paraphrase @entity190 , no matter how much he tried , @entity3 could n't break free from the past			1
while his bad albums in subsequent decades were justly criticized , his good ones were unfairly underrated			0
although he remained curious , enthusiastic and eager to take risks right up to 2003 's " reality , " he was punished for no longer reinventing the wheel with each release			0
as long as @entity3 was still recording regularly , all but his most devoted fans took him for granted			1
they wo n't be making that mistake again			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			2
