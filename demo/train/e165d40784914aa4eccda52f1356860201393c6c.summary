-- the allegations about @entity2 keep coming			1
for decades , @entity2 was thought of in glowing terms as a perceptive comedian , upbeat pitchman and genial father figure			1
his public personality made him more than rich -- it made him a role model , admired for his support of education and his no - nonsense talks on parenting and achievement			0
in recent weeks , that persona has been paired with another , much darker image			0
on tuesday , the famed comedian and tv star was accused of rape by @entity20 , a former model			1
in an interview on " @entity22 , " @entity20 claimed @entity2 assaulted her in 1982 after the two had dinner in @entity25			1
@entity2 attorney @entity26 was blunt in his response			1
" @entity20 's story accusing @entity2 of rape is a lie , " he told @entity0 in a statement			1
" there is a glaring contradiction between what she is claiming now for the first time and what she wrote in her own book and what she told the media back in 2002			0
ms. @entity20 did an interview with the @entity42 in september 2002 entitled ' @entity43 ' completely contradicting her new story about mr. @entity2			1
" that interview a dozen years ago said ' she did n't want to go to bed with him and he blew her off			0
' her publisher @entity49 can confirm that no attorney representing mr. @entity2 tried to kill the alleged rape story ( since there was no such story ) or tried to prevent her from saying whatever she wanted about @entity2 in her book			1
" he added , " documentary proof and ms. @entity20 's own words show that her new story about something she now claims happened back in 1982 is a fabricated lie			1
" @entity20 's allegations come on the heels of other rape accusations			1
@entity2 has repeatedly said the allegations are untrue			1
he has never been prosecuted			0
over the weekend , @entity2 was asked about " serious allegations raised about you " by @entity69 's @entity68			1
" do you have any response to those charges ? " @entity68 asked			0
in response , @entity2 shook his head in silence			2
on sunday , @entity2 attorney @entity75 released a written statement			1
" over the last several weeks , decade - old , discredited allegations against mr. @entity2 have resurfaced , " @entity75 said			1
" the fact that they are being repeated does not make them true			0
mr. @entity2 does not intend to dignify these allegations with any comment			1
" the accusations have received wide publicity in recent weeks , spurred in particular by two events : a viral video of comedian @entity87 in which he called @entity2 a " rapist , " and an attempt to create a @entity2 meme sponsored by @entity2 's @entity93 account			1
the latter led to many images of @entity2 with the rape accusations emblazoned over his picture			2
the allegations have taken a toll on @entity2 's family - friendly , fatherly image			1
on tuesday , @entity102 announced that a @entity2 special , set to debut november 28 , would be postponed			1
then , on wednesday , his old network , @entity104 , announced that a @entity2 show in the works has been scuttled			1
the events detailed by @entity2 's accusers took place over many decades			1
five women have gone on record in describing them			0
another woman , @entity112 , approached @entity113 , @entity114 , authorities in 2005 , but prosecutors decided they had " insufficient credible and admissible evidence			0
" " the desire on our part to move forward was pretty strong , " @entity118 , then the @entity113 district attorney , told @entity0 's " @entity122 " on wednesday			2
" the problem with the case was she waited a year until she told police about it			0
" at the time , @entity2 lawyer @entity128 told @entity0 the allegations were " utterly preposterous " and " plainly bizarre			1
" @entity112 later filed a civil suit			0
her lawyers said they found 13 @entity133 witnesses with similar stories			0
