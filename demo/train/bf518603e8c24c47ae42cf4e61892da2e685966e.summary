-- " you 've probably seen them bagging groceries , " said the geneticist attempting to explain to my wife and me that our 1 - day - old daughter , @entity4 , had down syndrome and what that meant for her future			1
her age was measured only in hours and already , expectations for @entity4 's potential had been capped			1
earlier , we were sitting in a recovery room holding @entity4 , hosting visitors , e-mailing pictures along with requisite weight and length statistics and basking in the afterglow of a seamless delivery and the addition of a beautiful , healthy daughter			1
then @entity4 was carted off to the " well baby " nursery for a routine examination by a pediatrician			1
my wife and i exhaled and exchanged a silent smile			0
a brief window of unmitigated joy			0
we did not know our calm would soon break			0
as we would learn , @entity4 had been relocated to the hospital 's neonatal intensive care unit because of a heart condition suspected by the pediatrician			1
her prognosis was encouraging , but her immediate condition was tenuous -- she needed supplemental oxygen and medication to help her heart and lungs work properly			0
and , we were told , a geneticist would visit us to discuss an additional diagnosis			0
that " additional diagnosis " was hardly the afterthought it sounded at the time			0
what is @entity48 ? down syndrome is a chromosomal condition caused by the presence of a third copy of the 21st chromosome			1
it is the most common chromosomal condition , affecting more than 400,000 @entity55 , according to the @entity56			0
down syndrome is associated with delayed cognitive ability and physical growth			0
i secretly hoped that it was all just a bad dream			0
but instead of awaking to relief , each morning was greeted with pounding guilt for wishing that @entity4 was any different than the miracle she was destined to be			1
learn more about @entity48 we coped with the stress of her heart complication , from which she recovered by the time she was 3 months old , and we began to accept the challenges associated with @entity48 that lay ahead			1
but the visual painted by the geneticist of @entity4 as an adult , wearing a name tag and struggling to load a milk carton into a grocery bag , was etched in our minds			1
that description of @entity4 's diminished outlook , delivered as a foregone conclusion , was difficult to accept			1
it was an injustice that took time to fully appreciate and gnaws at me even today			0
@entity4 , now almost 5 , has tackled life head on , making friends and enjoying childhood while enduring endless hours of physical , occupational and speech therapies to track milestones that come naturally for her older brother			2
@entity4 has braved " two - a - days " her entire life , showing up on time and ready to play			2
a dad 's confession : i almost left my disabled daughter never have i been more proud than witnessing @entity4 walk for the first time			1
knees wobbly and body trembling , she reached to the outstretched arms there to support her while shooting a look that signaled , " i 've got this			0
" in the nearly five years since @entity4 's birth , we 've experienced vast misunderstandings about the potential for individuals with @entity48			1
too often , people look at @entity4 and see " disability			1
" they see " ca n't			1
" even highly educated clinicians are not immune to misconception , electing to chart her against diminished benchmarks of success and suggest that @entity4 should settle for less because " that 's just the way most kids with ' downs ' are			1
" a long list of possible accomplishments and yet , we 've met adults with @entity48 who can check boxes for successful student , accomplished athlete , productive employee , prom king or queen or husband or wife			2
and while scientific breakthroughs and novel therapies should further advance the potential of @entity4 's generation in the long - term , her daily accomplishments demand that we discount her disadvantages now			1
they demand that we focus on her abilities and expect more from her			0
the contradiction between @entity4 's accomplishments and the geneticist 's projection has shaped how we parent all three of our children ( @entity4 now also has a younger brother )			1
we believe that children , whether they have @entity48 or not , tend to perform to the level of expectations placed upon them			1
expectations are often misconstrued as setting a floor on performance			2
rather , we believe expectations serve as a ceiling , so we 've learned the trick is to set high expectations balanced with reassurances that it is ok to fail			2
and the only true failure is not testing the boundaries of our capabilities , wherever that may be			0
from early on , we 've educated @entity4 's brothers about @entity48 and what that means for her -- " @entity4 can do everything you can do ; it just may take her longer or require extra help , but she 'll get there eventually			1
" her older brother , then 3 , retorted , " can she go to the moon ? " " yes , " we responded			0
" maybe someday she can go to the moon			0
" of course , it 's important to recognize challenges and provide resources to address them			2
it 's true , @entity4 needs support , and lots of it			1
but , too often , people focus on her disadvantages and lose sight of her strengths			2
even school administrators try to classify her , listing her deficits , setting expectations low and building a case to separate her from her typically developing peers despite numerous studies that would suggest including her with her peers is mutually beneficial			2
but pigeonholing her is the path of least resistance			0
low expectations are , after all , the easiest to meet			2
behind that cute face is steely grit the people closest to @entity4 know the truth			1
they know that she is capable of much more than what most expect of her			0
that they should n't be fooled by her infectious smile , capable of lighting up a room , because behind that cute facade is a fiercely determined girl			2
@entity4 proves that every saturday during her rock climbing class			2
sure , she is intimidated by the 30 - foot walls , struggles with the climb and rarely makes it all the way to the top			0
but after a brief break , she 'll look at me and say , " again , @entity214			0
" and , equally importantly , the people closest to @entity4 also know she is just like most of the 4 - year - old girls in her preschool class			1
she is a princess at heart who loves to host play dates and go swimming			0
she enjoys playing catch with her brothers and occasionally catches flak for teasing them			0
she 's more alike than different			0
recently , we asked @entity4 's older brother , " do you remember what it means for @entity4 to have down syndrome ? " " yes , " he answered			1
" it means she can go to the moon			0
but it 's not fair , why does @entity4 get the extra ' chrome ? ' " he was referring to @entity4 's extra copy of chromosome 21 , the defining characteristic of @entity48			1
if only our society could look through that same lens and focus on abilities rather than disabilities			0
a prenatal screen pegged the odds of @entity4 having down syndrome at less than one in 3,000 , so we like to think @entity4 has defied expectations from the very beginning			1
and we trust she will continue to do so from here on out			0
though we hope , one day , she wo n't have to			0
we hope one day our expectations of her , as a society , are more limitless than they are limited			0
@entity4 has taught us many lessons about parental love , but perhaps the most important of which is not letting societal expectations dictate all that a child can be			1
as we enter the new year , we tend to make lots of resolutions -- most of which are forgotten long before february			0
i 'm hoping @entity4 's story can help us make a more lasting resolution , together , to recalibrate our societal expectations			1
let 's recognize the disadvantage , but not overcompensate for it by setting the bar too low			0
let 's , for this new year and all that follow after , see the " can " in those children affected by @entity48			1
in fact , let 's do that for all our children -- extra chromosome or not			2
and , as for @entity4 , she 'll see you on the moon			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity283 .			2

@entity283 's daughter , @entity4 , is 4 and was born with @entity48
he feels that lowered expectations *unnecessarily* limit children with disabilities
" too often , people look at @entity4 and see ' disability . ' they see ' ca n't , ' " he writes
