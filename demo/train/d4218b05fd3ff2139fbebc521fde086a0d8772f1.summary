@entity0 -- it 's called " @entity0 's @entity3			1
" but the atmosphere at this massive gathering for single @entity7 men and women was decidedly unromantic			1
more than 18,000 people preregistered for the weekend event , located rather incongruously in a sprawling shopping complex specializing in home and office furniture			1
the crowds were met by billboards posting lists of thousands of single men and women -- one list in pink and the other in blue			1
within minutes of the doors opening on a rainy saturday morning , visitors huddled to study the lists and take in vital intel about potential suitors -- age , height , education , annual income and their registered hometown , also known as hukou			1
some people took notes , while others snapped photos of single entries with their cellphones			1
in one hall more than a hundred men and women in their twenties and thirties sat facing each other at tables decorated with red and yellow tablecloths , the soothing tones of a @entity49 love song spilling out from loudspeakers			1
" welcome everybody to our 8 - minute speed - dating event , " announced the master of ceremonies eventually			1
when the eight minutes was up , each dater was instructed to move on			2
" male guests please move two seats to your left , " boomed the announcer			2
for some participants , this was the first time they had ever been on a date			2
" it 's useful ... it 's just like research , " said @entity63 , a 20 - year - old man home for the summer holidays from a university in @entity68			2
@entity63 said he has never had a girlfriend before			0
this is not uncommon amongst young @entity7 , considering many teens are discouraged from having any romantic relationships in high school and told to focus on school work instead			1
he came to the expo to learn what women want from men			1
" after asking them , i now know something : women do n't like men to rely on their parents , " he said			1
@entity63 was participating in a speed - dating event organized by @entity88 , one of @entity7 's largest internet match - making websites			1
the company says it has more than 58 million registered users and is growing by one million users a month			0
@entity96 's founder and ceo is a @entity98 - educated former investment banker named @entity99			0
he says the one - child policy implemented by the @entity7 government in 1979 has resulted in young adults having poor social skills -- crucial in the dating game			1
" a lot of kids who were born after 1980 , they do n't have siblings			0
so they grow up in an environment where you do n't have the experience to meet with people of the opposite sex , " @entity99 opined			0
many participants said they came to the convention because they needed help			0
they said they found it difficult to meet potential romantic partners outside their immediate circle of friends and family			1
and many @entity7 approaching their late twenties , especially women , are under immense pressure to get married			1
" my mother asks , ' why are you still single ? are you a freak ? ' " said @entity129 , a 26 - year - old woman who was taking part in a speed - dating session			1
the woman next to her , who asked to be called may and is also 26 , said her father asked the same question			0
" everyone has the same story , " said may laughing			0
" i feel free because i 'm single ... but i know this is the time i need to date somebody			1
i need to get married before thirty			0
" both women said they did not want to become shengnu , or the " leftover women			1
" " it is one of the most talked about issues in @entity7 society because a lot of educated women are left behind because they set a very high standard for their future husbands ... and they are less willing , unlike their parents ' generation , to compromise , " said @entity96 's @entity99			1
may , who has a good job in human resources at an international firm and speaks fluent @entity157 , said this was her first time at a match - making event			1
she said she had never had a boyfriend before or been in love			0
" i have no time to get to know other males at a similar age ... that 's why i ca n't find my mister right , " she said			2
" i just wish that i have some luck today			0
" despite being rejected by two men , may was in good spirits			2
she said that the two men needed a women who had a registered hukou in @entity0			1
for a gathering of thousands of single men and women , it was surprising to note that there was very little flirting going on			1
people wandered the corridors picking up brochures from match - making companies and stopped in to listen to self - help lectures from " life coaches , " who were schooling women in how to " brand " themselves			2
at times , the @entity3 felt like a job fair			0
online match - making entrepreneur @entity99 said that was an accurate comparison			0
finding a spouse is " almost like finding a job , " he said			0
" people tend to be very pragmatic , " he explained			0
" [ being single ] is a problem that you have an obligation to fix			2
and your parents feel that it is their obligation to see to it -- to get this problem fixed			1
" another startling revelation was that there were nearly as many parents at the @entity3 as there were single men and women			1
some parents stood at the bustling entrance to the convention holding up printed posters advertising the details of their single children			1
others walked alongside their adult sons and daughters , inspecting the booths of different match - making agencies			0
one match - maker told @entity1 she had to prohibit parents accompanying their children to the speed - dating tables			1
" i respect my parents ' opinion , " said may			2
" if my parents say this guy is no good , then i wo n't date [ him ]			2
but if my parents say this one is good , that they are happy with this boy , then i will try			2
" in some cases , mothers and fathers clearly played a role as social icebreakers for their children			0
at one point , while wandering the corridors of the convention , may got a phone call			0
it was her father who was also there			0
may found him standing next to another father he had just met			0
the man happened to have a single son who worked in a bank and did not attend the convention			2
fortunately he carried a photo -- and a passport -- of his son , which he showed to may			2
" his picture looks good			0
a little bit handsome , " may responded			0
then she stood somewhat awkwardly as the man 's father took a photo of her in the crowded corridor			0
may 's father looked over his counterpart 's shoulder , murmuring advice as the digital image was taken			0
may seemed pleased and grateful to the two dads			0
" they are both trying to help their child find their mr. @entity266 and miss right			0
