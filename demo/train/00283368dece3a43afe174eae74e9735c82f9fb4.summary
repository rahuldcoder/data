@entity0 , @entity1 -- they are young , earn little and spend little , and take a keen interest in fashion and personal appearance -- meet the " herbivore men " of @entity1			1
former @entity2 intern @entity8 is a self - described ' herbivore			2
' author and pop culture columnist @entity10 coined the term in 2006 in a series of articles on marketing to a younger generation of @entity1 men			1
she used it to describe some men who she said were changing the country 's ideas about just what is -- and is n't -- masculine			1
" in @entity1 , sex is translated as ' relationship in flesh , ' " she said , " so i named those boys ' herbivorous boys ' since they are not interested in flesh			1
" typically , " herbivore men " are in their 20s and 30s , and believe that friendship without sex can exist between men and women , @entity10 said			1
the term has become a buzzword in @entity1			1
many people in @entity0 's @entity40 neighborhood were familiar with " herbivore men " -- and had opinions about them			1
@entity42 said such men were not eager to find girlfriends and tend to be clumsy in love , and he admitted he seemed to fit the mold himself			2
" my father always asks me if i got a girlfriend			0
he tells me i 'm no good because i ca n't get a girlfriend			0
" @entity50 , a 24 - year - old woman sporting oversized aviators and her dyed brown hair in long ringlets , said " herbivore men " were " flaky and weak			1
" " we like manly men , " she said			0
" we are not interested in those boys -- at all			0
" @entity58 , 21 , said he has been told he is " totally herbivorous			0
" " @entity60 boys are fragile , do not have a stocky body -- skinny			0
" @entity10 said @entity1 men from the baby boomer generation were typically aggressive and proactive when it came to romance and sex			1
but as a result of growing up during @entity1 's troubled economy in the 1990s , their children 's generation was not as assertive and goal - oriented			1
their outlook came , in part , from seeing their fathers ' model of masculinity falter even as @entity1 women gained more lifestyle options			2
former @entity2 intern @entity8 , a self - described herbivore , said the idea goes beyond looks and attitudes toward sex			2
" some guys still try to be manly and try to be like strong and stuff , but you know personally i 'm not afraid to show my vulnerability because being vulnerable or being sensitive is not a weakness			0
" older generations of @entity1 men are not happy about the changes			1
at a bar frequented by businessmen after work , one man said : " you need to be carnivorous when you make decisions in your life			0
you should be proactive , not passive			0
" @entity10 said the group does not care so much about making money -- a quality tied to the fact that there are fewer jobs available during the current global economic recession			1
@entity1 's economy recently saw its largest - ever recorded contraction and has shrunk for four straight quarters			2
blue chip companies @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 all reported losses in may , and most are forecasting the same for the current fiscal year			0
though still low by international standards , @entity1 's reported 5 percent unemployment is the highest since 2003			2
@entity8 agreed economics has played a role			0
when he finished university , " a lot of my friends were trying to work for a big company that pays well and i was n't interested in that			0
i am kind of struggling financially and my father is not very happy about it , " he said			0
@entity10 estimated some 20 percent of men are what she would call " herbivorous " and said their attitudes were influencing others			2
indeed , she said , it was a return to the norm for @entity1 men , rather than a departure			1
" it was after @entity138 and the post-war economic growth that @entity1 men gained the reputation as a sex animal through the competition with the @entity143			1
looking back beyond that time , older literature talks a lot about men with the kind of character we see in the herbivorous boys			0
" will these men simply grow out of this ? @entity10 said it was anyone 's guess			1
some of them may , but @entity1 's image of masculinity is nonetheless changing			1
" the men in dark suits are changing , too , " she said			2
" today 's young people in dark suits are different from the baby boomers in dark suits			0
they are evolving , too			0

author and pop culture columnist @entity10 coins the term ' herbivore men '
she says these men are changing the country 's ideas about what is masculine
these men are less interested in making money , sex
@entity10 says the trend may indeed be a return to the norm for @entity1 men
