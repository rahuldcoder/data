we ca n't settle @entity1 vs. @entity2 or " @entity4 " vs. " @entity5 " for you			0
but another long - running geek debate was put to rest tuesday night			0
those short , animated loops that have captivated the web for decades ? they 're pronounced like a brand of peanut butter			2
@entity12 created the @entity13 , or @entity13 , while working for @entity14 in 1987			1
on tuesday , he received a @entity15 for it and delivered his five - word acceptance speech ( that 's all the @entity15 allow ) by flashing a @entity13 on the big screens at the @entity19 in @entity20			1
and , in a flash , it all became clear : " it 's pronounced @entity24 , not @entity13			1
" of course , in the grand tradition of heated debate , a flat statement of fact by the creator was n't enough to sway some partisans			1
on @entity31 , " @entity13 " became a trending topic as some folks pushed back			1
# gif # hardg , " wrote web designer @entity35			0
" so instead of @entity13 , we 've got to say @entity24 ? yeah right , " chimed in october @entity38 , creator of the " @entity41 " @entity39 and book			1
" and i suppose those animals with long necks are called ' @entity44			0
' " and , of course , the peanut butter brand was getting lots of free publicity along the way			0
the always amusing @entity51 account ( yes , somebody tweets as the robot from " 2001 " ) posted an " animated @entity24 " -- which is to say , a swirling , animated jar of the tasty , high - protein spread			1
so , it 's perhaps no surprise that the company got into the act itself			2
wednesday afternoon , the company took to @entity31 with a post reading , " it 's pronounced @entity24			1
" the tweet linked to , what else , a multi-colored @entity13 flashing the same phrase			1
animated gifs were a staple of the early @entity69			0
remember the @entity70 ? that 's a @entity13			1
they fell out of favor as more advanced graphics technology emerged			0
but in the past couple of years , the @entity75 has remembered how much fun it is to watch ridiculous things happen over and over again			0
appropriately , @entity12 received his @entity80 from @entity81 , the founder of @entity39 , one prominent place where @entity83 found a new fanbase			2
in less publicized interviews , @entity12 had argued for the soft - g pronunciation for years			2
so , will a widely covered " speech " in front of some of the @entity75 's most influential folks finally be the turning point ? maybe not			2
last month , no less an authority than the @entity93 posted an image on its new @entity39 feed advocating for the hard - @entity96 and the @entity97 says both pronunciations are acceptable			0
so , here 's wishing mr. @entity100			0

@entity13 creator : it 's pronounced " @entity24 "
@entity12 created the @entity13 in 1987 at @entity14
he pronounced the issue *closed* at the @entity15
and yet , some partisans remain *unswayed*
