@entity0 -- my first morning at @entity4 's @entity3 consisted of an indescribable burger at @entity6			1
we are thinking of going to one of two tgi friday 's for dinner in @entity10 there is always @entity12 for tomorrow morning if i want to walk the half mile or so from my pod hotel room			2
i 'm on day two of my time inside @entity4 's international transfer terminals			1
they are long , clean , stuffed with shops and not stuffed with very many people			0
the person i have come to look for is @entity20 , the former @entity22 computer contractor who spilled details of @entity26 surveillance programs to reporters			1
president @entity28 says he wo n't take extraordinary measures to track @entity20 down			1
he is apparently holed up in here , somewhere			0
he is not likely in one of the hostel - like rooms you can rent by the hour , nor is he in the bars -- i have dutifully checked them all , including the annoying one with piped bird song surrounded by 1970s rustic charm			2
this is a 24 - hour transit hub , so we could buy a beer at 2:30 a.m. and i could have bought luggage , vodka , chocolate and toys all night long			2
@entity20 could too , but no one has seen him getting gifts for his next hosts , whoever they may be			1
it 's not the worst place to be holed up			0
our excitement thursday was crowding around @entity54 to see if @entity20 caught the flight to @entity56 , @entity57			1
two dozen or so journalists , most working off iphones or @entity60 pretending not to be journalists , filmed and photographed bemused @entity63 children and their parents looking forward to a summer holiday in the sun , while an angry @entity68 agent told us we could not film , but did nothing to stop us			0
a number of journalists now seem to have packed up and took the next stage out of town			0
there is n't another flight to @entity57 until saturday and why is it presumed he will take one any time soon ? so it 's another night in the hourly hotel with paper - thin walls for those of us staying			0
still it 's better than sleeping against a wall of @entity3 in bright lights which dozens of people did last night .			0

@entity4 's international *airport* is hub of the hunt for @entity20
but he has not been seen for days
