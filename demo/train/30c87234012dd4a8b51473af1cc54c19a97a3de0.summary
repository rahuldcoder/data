-- only the @entity1 stood between life and death for @entity4 , and the core principles of @entity7 jurisprudence should have been the board 's guide			1
but the board ignored those principles in denying @entity4 clemency			1
@entity4 was convicted in 1991 of the 1989 murder of @entity15 police officer @entity14			2
but the trial included no physical evidence to support his conviction			0
the prosecution produced no murder weapon , no dna evidence and no surveillance tapes			0
he was sentenced to death on the basis of nine so - called eyewitnesses , who testified in the trial			0
seven of those witnesses , however , have since recanted or materially changed their stories			0
the jury , for instance , relied on two people who did not witness the crime but who testified that @entity4 had confessed to the shooting			2
since then , both have said they were lying			0
the @entity1 declared in 2007 that it " will not allow an execution to proceed in this state unless and until its members are convinced that there is no doubt as to the guilt of the accused			2
" and in the @entity4 case , a significant measure of doubt remained			1
the @entity7 @entity46 took the extraordinary step of ordering a lower court to conduct an evidentiary hearing in the case because of the witness recantations and the absence of hard evidence			0
but in that hearing , the federal judge established a much higher standard of proof than the @entity1			0
after finding -- astonishingly for the first time -- that executing an innocent man is unconstitutional , the court then required @entity4 to prove that he was innocent			1
proving innocence is far more difficult than establishing doubts as to one 's guilt and flips our system of criminal jurisprudence on its head			1
instead of the @entity7 system 's presumption of innocence and a requirement that the state prove guilt , @entity4 ' evidentiary hearing began with the court presuming guilt and required the condemned to prove his innocence			1
even though the judge in the evidentiary hearing denied @entity4 a new trial , he conceded the standard was " extraordinarily high			2
" @entity4 was unable to meet this nearly insurmountable task			2
but while he fell short of " proving " his innocence , he established doubts as to his guilt , prompting the judge to concede the state 's case against him was " not ironclad			1
" i support the death penalty , and have for a long time			1
and i am not making a judgment as to whether @entity4 is guilty or innocent			1
but surely the citizens of @entity15 and the @entity92 want justice served on behalf of @entity14 , the police officer			0
imposing a death sentence on the skimpiest of evidence does not serve the interest of justice			0
the @entity1 did not honor the standards of justice on which all @entity7 depend by granting clemency			0
in doing so , it will allow a man to be executed when we can not be assured of his guilt			0
that was the final admirable principle standing between @entity4 and his scheduled death by lethal injection wednesday			1
and the parole board did not uphold it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity113 .			0

@entity113 : @entity92 parole board 's denial of clemency to @entity4 was *wrong* ruling
@entity120 : @entity4 set to be executed despite significant doubt about his guilt
@entity4 , rather than innocent till proven guilty , had to prove innocence , @entity113 says
@entity113 says he supports death penalty but not when it 's on skimpy , *unreliable* evidence
