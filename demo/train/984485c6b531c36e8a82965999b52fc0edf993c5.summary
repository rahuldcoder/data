@entity0 -- an @entity3 daredevil is planning to become the first person to break the sound barrier in a free fall , without riding in a vehicle			1
this summer in @entity8 , @entity9 hopes to make the highest , longest and fastest fall ever			1
his attempt will take him to an altitude where the atmosphere ends and space begins -- where blood boils at body temperature , and the air temperature could be as low as minus 70 degrees @entity17			1
the first step in the attempt will be riding a helium balloon to an altitude of 120,000 feet above sea level -- almost 23 miles -- higher than anyone has ascended in a balloon before			1
then , wearing a pressurized suit and oxygen tanks , he plans to jump out of his capsule for a five - minute fall back to @entity29			1
within the first 30 seconds , he expects to be falling faster than the speed of sound , which at that altitude is around 690 miles per hour			1
crossing that barrier would mark a new test of the limits of the human body			1
" this is what we want to find out : what happens to the human body when it breaks the speed of sound , " @entity9 said			1
" that 's a big question mark			2
" to increase his chances of survival , his parachute is set to open automatically , even if he 's unconscious or spinning so fast his hands are pinned by the g - force			2
he said his engineers are taking every precaution , testing out the suit in a wind tunnel and providing him with a backup chute , sealed gloves and boots , and an advanced helmet			2
" this helmet also has face - shield heating to make sure your visor 's not getting fogged up on the way down , because that would be fatal , " he said			2
" if you do n't see anything , you ca n't move anymore			0
you ca n't make decisions			0
" still , the risk of the unknown remains			0
" if something happens , it happens fast , " he said			0
" you can never say you 're not going to get killed under any circumstances , " but " we have a lot of solutions for emergency situations like this			0
" a chain reaction of events would have to occur before the jump could turn fatal , he said			2
a potential benefit from the mission , he said , would be demonstrating that it is possible to return from space without a spacecraft			0
" in the future , a lot more tourists will go and travel to space			0
and if something goes wrong with their spacecraft , they have to return to @entity29 somehow , " he said			0
" we will show to the world that egress from high altitude is survivable			0
" the main difference is that @entity9 will start from a standstill , whereas astronauts in a craft like the space shuttle are traveling at orbital speeds close to 18,000 mph when their re-entry begins			1
the previous record for the highest jump has stood for half a century , since it was set in 1960 by @entity103 with the @entity104			1
he reached an altitude of 102,800 feet , and says it felt like a very distant and hostile place to be			1
" you know that right outside of you is a vacuum of space , " he said , " and without the protection of that pressure suit , you can not live			2
and that 's an interesting thought			0
" @entity9 , whose attempt is being financed by energy drink maker @entity116 , has enlisted @entity103 as a consultant			1
" we have learned a lot from people in the past who tried to break that record , and they all failed , " @entity9 said			1
" some of these people got killed			0
" but he adds , " i think it 's human nature , you know			0
records are meant to be broken			0
and i 'm a very competitive person			0

within 30 seconds of jump , @entity9 expects to break sound barrier
pressurized suit and oxygen tanks are among *special* *equipment* he will use
man who holds current record -- 102,800 feet -- is serving as consultant
