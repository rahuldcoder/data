@entity0 -- when @entity3 , 59 , and his " @entity4 " of leaders assume power , it will mark a first for @entity9 's post- 1949 generation and those who spent their formative years during the @entity11			1
in a series of steps , @entity3 , the current vice president since 2008 , is expected to be named general secretary of the @entity15 during its 18th @entity16 , which opens thursday , and then president next march , succeeding incumbent @entity19			1
as with all @entity9 leaders , details of @entity3 's life are tightly controlled by the government , creating a gap that biographies -- some written under pseudonyms , given the political sensitivities -- have sought to fill			1
@entity9 watchers meanwhile try to discern how he would lead			2
" @entity9 leaders do n't rise to the top telegraphing what changes they 'll do , " said @entity30 , a political science professor at @entity32 's @entity31			1
" they rise to the top showing how loyal they are to the incumbent			0
what they 'll do when they rise to the top -- that 's the big question			0
" read about what @entity3 faces @entity3 was born in 1953 , four years after the @entity15 defeated the ruling @entity45 and established the @entity9			1
he is the son of the second marriage of @entity47 , a revolutionary hero whom then - paramount leader @entity48 would appoint minister of propaganda and education			1
@entity47 would later become vice premier under @entity52 and secretary general of the @entity54 , @entity9 's highest administrative body , before being purged in 1962			2
until then , @entity3 had grown up a " princeling " in the enclave of power , @entity62 , with other children of @entity9 's first generation of leaders			1
one childhood peer was @entity64 , son of @entity65 , the first finance minister who was also purged during the @entity11			0
life was comfortable and far removed from the mass starvation during @entity48 's disastrous " @entity71 " campaign ( 1958 - 1962 ) , which was designed to transform the nation into an industrial society			0
however , a few years later , @entity3 -- his father by then deposed -- would be among 30 million " sent - down youth , " forced to leave cities for the countryside and mountains under another of @entity48 's policies			2
from 1969 - 1975 , or most of the @entity11 , @entity3 was an agricultural laborer in @entity80 , @entity81 , his ancestral province			0
" that generation went through a lot of difficulties , " said @entity82 , director of research at the @entity84 at the @entity85			0
" idealism and pragmatism in a very unique way combined in this generation			0
" read about @entity48 's shadow lingering over @entity9 the experience had a positive influence on @entity3 's view of @entity9 and the world , according to @entity97 , chairman of @entity98 , the publisher of " @entity9 's future : a biography of @entity3			1
" " even after he became a leader , he helped farmers , " @entity97 said			0
his favorite story was of the @entity104 - bound @entity3 in 1975 being accompanied by villagers who walked 60 li ( 30 km ) to send him off at a train station			0
@entity48 died in 1976 , and @entity3 's father was subsequently rehabilitated and became party secretary of @entity111 , where he oversaw @entity9 's first special economic zones near @entity0 -- reforms that would define then paramount leader @entity115 's economic legacy			1
@entity9 's next leader keeps @entity117 close to his heart the elder @entity3 's connections proved critical			1
after graduating from @entity104 with a chemical engineering degree in 1979 , @entity3 became the personal secretary to his father 's former comrade - in - arms , @entity122 , and became an active military servicemember			1
as vice premier , a member of the @entity15 's @entity130 and secretary general of the @entity132 , @entity122 " dominated @entity125 , government and the army , " according to " @entity133 , " affording @entity3 a rare vantage point			2
such military ties -- familial and professional -- give him what neither @entity19 nor his predecessor @entity136 had , said @entity138 , president of the @entity139			1
" the military takes him as one of the family members			0
" it was around this period that @entity3 was married to his first wife , @entity145 , the daughter of @entity147 , @entity9 's ambassador to @entity148 and a former underling of @entity47 , according to " @entity133			1
" not much is known about the marriage except that it ended in divorce within a few years			0
( in 1987 , @entity3 would marry his current wife , @entity152 , a popular folk singer for the @entity153			0
) read how @entity3 is considered a " mystery " in 1982 , when his father entered the ruling @entity130 and the @entity156 , @entity3 became county deputy secretary in @entity158 , @entity159 province , his first experience in rural politics			0
in this role , he took his first trip to the @entity164 -- as part of an agricultural delegation in 1985 to @entity159 's " sister state " of @entity117 -- and brought back knowledge of farming technology as well as tourism			2
this trip had a great impact on @entity3 , who stayed with a family in @entity174 , said @entity175 , chairman of @entity176 , which published a separate " biography of @entity3 " this year			2
" vocally , he 's a nationalist			0
psychologically , he greatly hopes to keep good relations with the @entity188 , especially the @entity164 , " @entity175 said , noting that @entity3 's daughter , @entity182 , studies there -- at @entity184 -- under a pseudonym			1
in a major policy speech in @entity190 in february @entity3 called for increasing strategic trust and reducing suspicions while respecting each other 's core interests , such as the " one - china policy " that opposes @entity196 and @entity198 independence			1
in an indirect reference to the @entity202 administration 's " rebalancing " strategy toward @entity203 , @entity3 said , " we hope the @entity164 will respect the interests and concerns of @entity9 and other countries in the region			1
" nonetheless , @entity3 got high marks for his desire to engage with the @entity164 , and his trip included meetings with president @entity202 , vice president @entity214 , secretary of state @entity215 and defense secretary @entity216			1
also not overlooked was the fact @entity3 chose to make a nostalgic stop in @entity117 , in addition to @entity220 , during his five - day @entity164 tour			2
read about @entity9 reaction to @entity202 's re-election win " from my conversations with people in the @entity164 , the reigning understanding is , ' this is a guy we can work with , ' " said @entity225 , director of the @entity226 at @entity227			1
@entity138 of the @entity139 echoed the sentiments , calling @entity3 " relaxed , very at ease to talk with people " and a departure from @entity15 leaders who tend to be " very cautious " when talking			2
read about how @entity164 , @entity9 are worlds apart but joined meanwhile , " @entity3 's leadership experience [ after @entity158 ] in running @entity242 , @entity243 , and @entity244 , three economically - advanced regions , has prepared him well for pursuing policies to promote the development of the private sector , foreign investment and trade , and the liberalization of @entity9 's financial system , " wrote @entity82 of @entity85 for the @entity239 in its winter 2012 edition			1
the run - up to @entity3 's ascension as @entity9 's next leader has nonetheless been bumpy			1
in september , his nearly two - week " disappearance " -- and canceled meetings with @entity261 and other foreign officials -- fueled speculation over his health and factional infighting			0
in an interview with @entity1 's @entity265 , former @entity0 chief executive @entity263 said @entity3 had suffered a back injury while swimming			2
even so , the @entity9 media 's " default mode " of not speaking about its leaders , coupled with the lack of a constitutional basis for the regime 's transfer of power , left people wondering , " what 's the @entity276 if something were to happen ? " @entity225 said			2
read about the struggle of ideas at the top also of note were two reports released by @entity283 on september 28 within three minutes of each other : the @entity16 ' november 8 opening date -- after much speculation it would fall in october -- and the expulsion of @entity64 from the @entity15			0
@entity65 now faces criminal prosecution in the wake of a scandal that saw his wife convicted of murder			0
given the turbulent lead - up to the @entity16 , @entity225 says he , like other @entity9 watchers , will be trying to glean clues as to @entity9 's political direction			2
he says a longer - than - expected @entity16 could hint at an inability to reach decisions			0
also important will be the make - up of the @entity130 , what happens to the key portfolios -- and crucially , whether @entity19 will relinquish his chairmanship of the @entity132 to @entity3 read about the secrecy surrounding @entity9 's @entity16 " having two centers -- the predecessor heading the military and the new leader second - in - command -- is not a healthy signal to the world , " @entity225 said			1
the flipside of having a more collective leadership as opposed to a dominant leader like @entity48 or @entity115 is that the " system has been set up to prevent a strong leader , " @entity30 of @entity32 said			0
all the more reason that the charismatic @entity65 , who had been tipped for the @entity130 and is said to have led a ruthless anti-crime campaign in @entity318 , drew some concern before his downfall			0
read a who 's who of @entity9 's next leaders the clean reputation of @entity3 -- who had become @entity244 's leader after his predecessor , @entity326 , was dismissed over a social security fund scandal -- took a hit in june when @entity329 reported on the wealth of his extended family			1
although no assets were traced to @entity3 , his wife or daughter , @entity329 found that his extended family had business interests in minerals , real estate and mobile - phone equipment , with assets in the hundreds of millions			0
last month the @entity340 gave a similar treatment to premier @entity342 , reporting on the staggering wealth of his relatives -- a review that found assets of at least $ 2.7 billion			0
@entity3 and the new leaders will have to demonstrate to the public how serious they are in fighting widespread corruption , @entity225 said , or face " huge problems			2
" @entity1 's @entity351 contributed to this report .			0

as with all @entity9 leaders , government tightly controls details of @entity3 's life
@entity3 is the son of a revolutionary hero , grew up a " princeling "
@entity3 has military ties that predecessors @entity19 , @entity136 do n't , one *observer* notes
@entity3 received high marks during @entity190 trip for desire to engage @entity164
