@entity0 , @entity1 -- a " @entity5 " oil drill to reach 33 miners trapped in @entity1 is scheduled to start in earnest early wednesday amid hopes it will provide a faster solution than the other two methods used			1
but officials do not know how long it will take the drill , normally used in to drill for oil , to reach the men trapped 700 meters ( 2,300 feet ) underground			1
by wednesday afternoon , the @entity5 drill reached 40 meters , officials said			1
the plan is for the new drill to descend vertically for at least 40 meters before turning at an angle to reach the underground ramp that leads to the miners , said @entity21 , manager of the state copper mining company			1
@entity21 said that attaching directional motors to the drill would slow it to a speed of 1 meter per hour , adding that 20 to 30 meters per day " would be a good average			1
" under optimal conditions , it is capable of drilling 1,000 meters in 24 hours , said @entity30 , a site representative for @entity32 oil services company			1
meanwhile , the plan a drill was 366 meters in , and the @entity36 drill , which was widening a hole it made , was at 85 meters , @entity21 said			1
the @entity36 drill was temporarily halted wednesday after the drill bit came loose and fell down the mine , he said			1
" we felt a loss of pressure , and the miners called us to say the bit had fallen into the mine , " @entity21 said			1
officials believe that the malfunction occurred after the drill moved from hard rock to softer material			2
the bit that fell will remain in the mine , and a spare drill bit will be used , officials said			2
government engineers are finalizing designs for three rescue capsules , which will be sent down the completed rescue shaft to extract the miners one by one , according to @entity21			2
the capsules will take 10 to 12 days to build			0
@entity21 said the largest of the miners measures 48 inches around the shoulders			2
the " design of the capsule is being completed with this in mind , " @entity21 said			0
despite the fact that @entity68 is capable of significantly higher speeds than drills a and b , @entity21 would not move up the expected date of the miners ' rescue			2
" my sources are the technical indicators , and we are still working toward the beginning of november , " @entity21 said			0
engineers are dealing with hard rock and a much smaller area than they normally encounter , @entity30 said			0
" when we drill for oil , we have a much bigger target area of perhaps 50 or 60 meters			1
here we have a margin of error of just 4 meters , " he said			0
the need for precision in this drilling operation means the drill will move much more slowly , he said , but he gave no precise predictions			1
" if we did not have such a specific objective at 700 meters , then we could do this in two days , " he said			0
" but what changes all this is that we have to reach an objective with precision , and so we do not know how long that could take			2
" for now , the company has told @entity1 officials that it could take 40 days to complete the work , he said			0
he did not say whether time it took to assemble the rig and drill the pilot hole was included in that time frame			2
two other drills are also trying to reach the miners , who have been trapped since the august 5 cave - in			1
the drills , dubbed @entity110 and @entity111 , each require two holes to be drilled and have been moving at a rate of 30 or 40 meters a day			0
officials are planning how they will bring the miners to the surface once a bore hole is wide enough for the task			0
the daunting rescue may require an oxygen - fed cage that will haul them up one at a time			0
previously , officials have said that the workers could be rescued , if all goes well , in late october or early november			0
" when i look at their faces on their video they have sent to the surface , i would love to have them out by tomorrow , " @entity30 said			0
@entity2 's @entity129 and @entity130 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity5 option is normally used to drill for oil
the 33 miners have been trapped since august 5
rescuers are using three drilling methods to reach them
