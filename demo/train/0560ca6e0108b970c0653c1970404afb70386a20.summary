they had hiked in with a friend , who became ill and hiked out , the park service said			0
@entity41 , an @entity42 , @entity43 , resident and leader of the larger group , said extreme weather dumped up to three feet of snow and drastically lowered visibility in @entity49 and @entity51 national parks			1
the group of 10 hikers shared a love of climbing , outdoor activities and adventure , @entity41 said			1
they set out on their hike shortly after 4 a.m. monday in several sub-groups , including one led by @entity41 and another including all three missing hikers			1
" every single one had been training for this event for years , " said @entity41			0
the snow began for @entity41 's group when they reached 10,000 feet up what he called the " 10 - mile hill , " and picked up significantly as they went up another 2,000 feet			2
his group reached the summit around 3:30 p.m. monday , staying briefly at a shelter there before going back down the mountain			1
the climb back down was much more difficult than expected , according to @entity41 , due to the heavy snow			2

the three climbers did not have snow shoes , said @entity41			0
however , they likely had enough food and water to last several days , he said			0
temperatures near the mountain 's peak were in the 20s , @entity41 added , not low enough to make frostbite a major concern			0
