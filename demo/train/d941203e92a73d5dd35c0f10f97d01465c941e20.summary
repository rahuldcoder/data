discussion of the issue while @entity195 was in power " led to freezing of @entity7 - @entity5 political communications , to headaches in the relationship between @entity0 and @entity7 and , what is the most dangerous , to the deepening of the split of @entity5 society , the majority of which does n't support the idea of @entity5 entering @entity0 , " a @entity218 statement said			1
