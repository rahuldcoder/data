-- if you 're standing in the rain at the bus stop tomorrow morning , trying to get to work , and if , in the downpour , you should notice that waiting patiently for the bus with you is @entity7			1
. or if you 're in a long line at the convenience store , waiting to buy a lottery ticket in the hopes of striking it rich , and you see that the equally hopeful person in front of you in the @entity17 line is mr. @entity7			2
. will you please ask him something ? will you ask him about @entity20 ? we 'll get back to mr. @entity7 in a moment			1
he is , as you probably know , one of the world 's wealthiest and most influential men			0
as the co-founder and chairman of @entity27 , he has had vast influence on the way we live -- particularly in the way that screens , and our constant interaction with them , have taken over everything			0
which brings us to @entity20			2
a strong case can be made -- and several authors , deep thinkers and historians over the years have made it -- that @entity20 , more than any other single person ( or single cartoon character , in @entity20 's case ) , ushered in the era of interactivity			1
in the early day of television , @entity44 sat transfixed as the first sets were delivered to homes			0
the brand - new experience was like having a constantly programmed movie screen in the family living room			0
the pleasure , the convenience -- all a person had to do was lean back and be entertained			0
but two men -- a pair of fledgling television producers whose names were @entity60 and @entity61 -- had the foresight to realize that the screen did not necessarily have to be one - way			0
and that there was money to be made by encouraging people to treat the screen as something with which they could interact			0
thus was born " @entity20 " -- a primitive and rudimentary first step into what would eventually become the screen - obsessed world in which we live today : millions of people endlessly tapping away , sending and receiving messages , relentlessly responding to what glows in front of their eyes , regarding their screen as almost a person , a friend			1
" @entity20 , " which aired saturday mornings on @entity87 beginning in 1953 , was hosted by @entity85 and starred a sprightly , squeaky - voiced cartoon character named			2
well , you know what he was named			0
@entity20 's adventures were not all that spectacular -- but it is what he asked the children watching the show to do that heralded a cultural change			1
@entity20 said he wanted the children to mail away for a " @entity96 , " which was actually a cheaply produced , thin sheet of plastic that adhered to the tv screen by static electricity			1
" send your name and address , along with 50 cents , to @entity20 , @entity104 5 , @entity105 , 19 , @entity105 ! " those incessantly repeated words became one of the most familiar phrases in the land			2
along with the plastic sheet that arrived in the mail were " magic crayons			1
" children were encouraged to place the sheet on their tv screen and watch the show each saturday , so that @entity20 could tell them what to do			1
they might be instructed to draw a ladder on a certain part of the sheet , or a chimney , or a bridge			2
then the action on the television screen would combine with what the children had drawn on the plastic sheet to create a narrative - in - motion			1
it was a sensation , for a while			0
children who did n't own the magic sheet or the magic crayons felt left out -- they could watch the show , but they were n't participating in the whole experience			1
@entity20 guilted them into sending in the 50 cents so they were n't deprived of what every other kid on the block was doing			2
the show 's downfall derived from two things			0
according to author @entity144 , perhaps the world 's leading @entity20 authority , many children who did n't own the plastic sheets simply took crayons they had around the house and , on @entity20 's cue , drew directly on the glass screens of their parents ' expensive first - generation television sets			1
and if that did n't make the parents angry enough , there was the concern that the children , by sitting so close to the tv sets as they drew , could be exposing themselves to harmful radiation			2
the original show went off the air in 1957 , and although there were short - lived attempts to revive it , it is now just a distant memory			0
but @entity20 's influence lives on in every screen that every person today regards as a two - way window			1
which brings us to @entity7			2
there is a line that occasionally pops up in @entity20 - related literature			2
the line quotes @entity176 -- it has him crediting " @entity20 " as " the first interactive tv show			1
" it certainly would make sense			0
gates and his windows are the logical extension of @entity20 and his @entity96			2
@entity20 and @entity7 both saw the true back - and - forth possibilities of those screens			1
what @entity7 has accomplished is essentially @entity20 writ large			1
but , try as i might , i was unable to locate a reliable , rock - solid citation for that quote			0
was is it real -- had @entity7 ever actually uttered the words ? or was it merely some tall tale , repeated person - to - person by would - be believers ? i contacted the @entity27 corporate offices to ask if they could verify , for the sake of posterity , that @entity7 had , in fact , once sung the praises of @entity20			1
i had some false starts and hit some dead ends			0
i was able to get in touch with a man by the name of @entity208 , who once worked for @entity27 and who now is a spokesman for @entity7 himself			2
@entity208 said he had a distinct recollection of having been present at the key moment : " i remember the @entity20 speech -- but do n't remember when @entity7 gave it ( or where -- or to whom )			1
it was a brief example of ' here 's an early example of interactive tv ' before he went on to a bigger presentation of @entity27 's tv efforts			1
" he had one of the plastic film sheets -- and the @entity20 box , if i remember correctly			1
" so there it is			0
@entity7 was born in 1955 , so it is unlikely that he remembers watching in first - run the original version of " @entity20 and you			1
" perhaps he saw the subsequent attempts to bring the show back ; perhaps , like so many young @entity44 of the time , he simply found himself awash in the echoes of @entity20 's legend			1
every creative genius is influenced by someone			0
@entity237 was influenced by @entity238			0
@entity239 was influenced by @entity240			0
@entity241 was influenced by @entity242			0
in some future century , a new @entity243 may be carved , to celebrate the figures of our own era who changed the course of the world as dramatically as any presidents or statesmen			0
it will be only fitting and right if the three faces on the side of the mountain are those of @entity7 , @entity256 and @entity20			1
not necessarily in that order			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity260 .			0

@entity260 : a popular 1950s tv show featured interactivity with a screen
children were invited to draw on a plastic sheet placed on the tv showing " @entity20 and you "
the show faded , not least because kids were drawing on the plastic sheet
the question is , did @entity7 actually call it the " first interactive tv show , " or is that a *wishful* myth ?
