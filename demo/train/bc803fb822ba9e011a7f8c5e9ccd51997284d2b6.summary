@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 rover curiosity successfully raised the mast that holds many of its instruments wednesday , giving controllers a view of the ground scorched by the rockets that deposited it on the surface			1
the car - sized rover landed on @entity4 early monday after a harrowing descent that climaxed with its being lowered by a " skycrane " that hovered over the landing site			1
cameras mounted on @entity3 's remote sensing mast beamed back fresh images of the site once the column was raised into position , giving @entity25 a view of the roughly half - meter ( 19 - inch ) " scour marks " from the rocket exhaust			0
those gouges are giving mission controllers an unexpectedly early view of the bedrock beneath the surface of @entity35 , said @entity36 , a @entity3 project scientist at the @entity37			1
@entity4 rover beams back ' awesome ' shot of surface " apparently , there is a harder , rockier material beneath this veneer of gravel and pebbles , and obviously there 's some impact ejecta , " @entity36 told reporters at @entity25 's @entity42 , where controllers operate the rover			1
while @entity3 is n't yet ready to start driving around , " here we 've already got an exploration hole drilled for us , " @entity36 said			0
the mission of the mobile science laboratory is to determine whether @entity4 ever had an environment capable of supporting life			2
its prime target is the 18,000 - foot ( 5,500 - meter ) peak at the center of @entity35 , @entity62 , where scientists hope to get a layer - by - layer look at the history of the planet			0
@entity36 said so far , the landscape looks somewhat familiar			0
" the thing that really struck the science team about this image is that you would really be forgiven for thinking that @entity25 was trying to pull a fast one on you and we actually put a rover out in the @entity74 and took a picture -- a little @entity77 smog coming in there , " he said			1
@entity4 rover : is all this really necessary ? controllers are still activating @entity3 's instrument package , and all antennas that will beam back data to @entity42 " work perfectly , " mission manager @entity81 said wednesday			1
the onboard weather monitoring unit has turned out to be " completely healthy " following a brief glitch reported tuesday			1
the high - bandwidth antenna that aims back at @entity90 is beaming back " lots and lots of data " and the rover is expected to capture a color panorama of its surroundings on thursday , she said			2
" there are going to be some amazing images from that , " @entity81 said			0
@entity100 , one of @entity3 's operators , said images like those beamed back so far will be used to program the rover 's movements when it gets under way			1
because of the time needed for a radio signal from @entity90 to reach the rover -- about 14 minutes at @entity4 ' current position -- " we do n't command the rover with a joystick or a steering wheel in real time , " @entity100 said			2
" if we were to do that , by the time we would see we were at the edge of a cliff , the rover would have driven off of it			0
" opinion : did @entity4 landing make science cool again ? instead , operators use the photos to develop a plan for the next day 's operations and transmit it to the rover , which carries it out and sends back the results			1
curiosity will start its third full martian day , or sol , on thursday			0
a sol is about 40 minutes longer than a day on @entity90			0
the rover is supposed to run for two years , but a previous rover , @entity137 , has been working on @entity4 since 2004 -- well beyond the three months @entity25 planned			2
opportunity 's sister rover , @entity138 , ran from 2004 to 2010			0
@entity2 's @entity140 contributed to this report .			0
