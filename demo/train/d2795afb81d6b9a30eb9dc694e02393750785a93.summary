-- @entity1 has worked hard for her shot at fame			1
from humble beginnings in rural @entity6 , the 31 - year - old has stared down the barrel of poverty and prejudice to become one of the world 's leading trap shooters			1
@entity1 made history in 2010 when she became the first @entity6 woman to win a @entity16 medal ( a silver ) and has collected dozens of trap shooting ( a type of clay - pigeon shooting ) prizes over the years			1
two golds at the @entity23 held in the @entity24 last month were the latest landmarks in @entity1 's glittering shooting career which began in the decidedly less sparkly surroundings of @entity28 , a provincial village 50 km ( 30 miles ) north of @entity30			1
with around 5,500 inhabitants and a local economy based around agriculture , villagers have been more used to wielding scythes than shotguns and air pistols , but @entity1 's fortunes and others were transformed when a shooting range was set up in the late 1990s			1
" from the beginning i was always interested in sports but there were no facilities in the village , " @entity1 told @entity0 's human to @entity42			1
" but then a local doctor who used to work in @entity30 came and built a small shooting range			1
" the @entity50 is a modest affair with a 10 - meter range and a handful of shooting bays			1
there 's also limited electricity , so practice can only take place during the day			2
but these meager facilities have changed lives , says @entity1			1
" when people got to know that a shooting range has opened in the village , families realized that rather than the kids roaming free in the village they could get involved in this activity			1
it had a huge effect , " she says			0
along with producing a string of champion shooters , the range has also given villagers access to careers outside farming with many finding work with the @entity6 army and local police forces			1
sporting chance for @entity1 though the prospects of joining their number initially looked bleak -- she was approaching adulthood and expected to get married and become a housewife			2
" i spoke to my mother and father , asking them if i could do shooting			2
looking at the culture and society of the village they said it is not possible			2
it hurt me a lot and i felt really bad , " @entity1 said			2
" i realized that until the time someone from my family , most likely an elder , would go into shooting , my family would not let me enter the sport			2
" so when her mother had a go , attitudes towards the teenage @entity1 's participation changed			1
" my mother was 60 years old when she started shooting and participated in air pistol and air rifle ... she won medals at state level , then she played pre-nationals and nationals and won medals there too			2
" like her mother , @entity112 , @entity1 stared out using an air pistol but soon switched to a bigger weapon			1
" i ( competed ) in air rifle for two years , and my score was good : 390/400			0
but i thought i needed some other event , " she said			0
" when i saw the shotgun event for the first time i liked it			0
it was a very explosive event			0
my results was quite good in it and i won a lot of medals			2
" @entity1 enrolled in the @entity125 in 2004 and has been on @entity6 's shooting team since 2005 winning 32 gold medals at national level and five golds and one silver on the international stage			1
her speciality , trap shooting , involves hitting a series of moving targets from a distance of around 75 meters using a 12 - bore shotgun			2
when @entity1 clinched her historic silver medal at the @entity16 in 2010 she scored a personal best 70 out of 75 -- a mark she bettered by two points at the recent @entity23 during the women 's team event			1
on song the physical aspects of her sport are tiring -- there is a lot of recoil in the gun , she says -- but to shoot well requires a clear mind as much as a steady hand			2
" the most important is mental relaxation , " she says			0
" the best thing is music			0
i love listening to music			0
before every match i listen to a good song , and keep murmuring it			0
that is the best way to let go of all my mental stress			0
" whenever i miss the target or i get under pressure , then i say ' no , let 's sing a song			0
' that song keeps playing in my head			0
the benefit of the song playing in my head is that , i leave the pressure and the match becomes better because of it , " she laughs			0
with her mother still enjoying her shooting well into her 70s , @entity1 could be around at the top of her sport for decades to come			1
but for now the crosshairs are on some important targets just around the corner , like qualifying for the @entity179 in 2016			0
with a maximum of 30 places available for each competing country and two people per event , @entity1 will need to be at the top of her game next season when the quota places are earned at @entity16 events and world and continental championships			1
medals and titles are clearly important to @entity1 , but so are the triumphs of equality she has helped foster through her success , promoting a message to girls in her village and across @entity6 that they too can be the masters of their own destiny			1
" i remember my older times when i would come to this shooting range nervous and shy			0
i used to think , will i be able to do anything , will people ever get to know me ? all those things of the past i remember			0
" now i feel really good , and people know that and if girls are coming here for shooting they have achieved something			0
i love the feeling that many girls have come out of their house			0
