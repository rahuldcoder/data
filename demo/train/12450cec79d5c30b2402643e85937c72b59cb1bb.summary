is the president doing a good job handling the @entity3 crisis ? that 's one question the @entity7 senator running for reelection in @entity9 said is hard to answer			1
when faced with the question , sen. @entity10 could n't come up with an answer because , well , " it 's hard to know			2
" " @entity14 ... i would say that ... it 's hard to know , uh , because i have n't heard the latest briefing on that to know all the details -- i mean , i read the paper and all , but , " @entity10 said in an interview that aired tuesday on @entity22			0
@entity10 , who is locked in a tight contest this fall , said he is of course aware of the efforts by the @entity27 to contain the virus and the efforts of medical and engineering professionals fighting @entity3 in @entity31			1
so what gives ? has @entity33 done enough ? " umm ... again i 'd have to see the latest numbers , " @entity10 said			0
@entity10 's nonresponse comes just over a month after he attacked his opponent , rep. @entity36 , in an august ad that gave the @entity3 crisis a starring role			1
after rolling news clips about the crisis , the ad claims @entity36 " voted against preparing @entity41 for pandemics like @entity3 " and " cut billions from our nation 's medical disaster and emergency programs			2
" @entity10 's hesitation on judging @entity33 falls in a state where support for the president could hurt any @entity7 candidate , as just 33 % of @entity52 approve of the president 's job performance overall			2
no poll has shown what @entity52 think of @entity33 's handling of the @entity3 crisis			1
but maybe @entity10 will get some sympathy from voters			0
they have n't made up their mind yet on whether to give him another term			0
a @entity65 / @entity64 poll last month showed the race a dead heat , with @entity36 holding a 2 - point advantage that did n't break the margin of error .			0

judging @entity33 's handling of the @entity3 crisis ? " hard to know " for sen. @entity10
@entity10 is locked in a tight contest against @entity74 rep. @entity36
@entity10 ran an attack ad against @entity36 this *summer* that *spotlighted* the @entity3 crisis
