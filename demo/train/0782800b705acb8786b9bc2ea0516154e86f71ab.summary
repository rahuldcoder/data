-- it 's now a week after @entity2			1
can we please stop saying , " @entity2 ? " telling people " @entity2 " more than a week after the first of the year is like keeping your @entity6 lights up until february			1
and i grew up in @entity10 ; i know a thing or two about tacky			2
plus it 's bad @entity14 's etiquette			2
that 's not just me talking , that 's the opinion of etiquette expert @entity17 , founder of the @entity20			1
we are not all " @entity22			0
" ) @entity17 told me : " in my opinion , after the first week , i stop wishing others a @entity24 , the new year is well on its way			1
" the biggest reason we need to stop @entity14 's wishes weeks into the year is that it sounds so insincere			1
hollow , not heartfelt , like something you say to a co-worker you really do n't know well to fill an awkward silence , a small step up from , " that 's some weather we 're having , huh ? " the same goes for the insincerity you detect when people greet you a few days after january 1 with the question : " so how 's your new year been so far ? " really ? you are actually asking if i have survived the first " grueling " 48 hours of the year ? if you really care about how my year is going , ask me in october			1
look : no one says " @entity43 " on december 1			0
i never heard anyone offer a " @entity45 " on july 6			0
and when is the last time you heard a " happy @entity48 " on march 19 ? even with the big religious holidays , well wishing starts before the holiday and stops with its occurrence			0
go ahead and joyfully exchange wishes of " have a @entity6 " the week before the holiday through christmas day , but not on december 29			1
happy @entity56 greetings are fine throughout the eight - day holiday but not after			0
and @entity59 wishes are contained within the 30 days of the holy month and stop with the @entity62 celebration at the month 's end			1
tech : losing @entity14 's resolve ? @entity66 wants to help sure , i get it : it 's a wish for a full year , not just a day			0
but among the vast array of omens that predict good fortune for the coming year , not one involves saying @entity24 's for weeks on end			1
believe me , there are some odd superstitions out there that will supposedly bring you luck for the year , from kissing a loved one as the clock strikes midnight to writing your new year 's wishes on a piece of paper and planting it in the ground to eating lentils or black - eyed peas on @entity2			0
there are even admonitions to avoid certain activities on @entity2 because they portend bad luck for the coming year			0
one such superstition tells us that eating poultry on @entity2 means you will financially struggle for the coming year , which i really wish i had known before i ate chicken with mixed vegetables on january 1			0
if even one custom instructed us that extended @entity14 's wishes would increase the chances the year would indeed be a good one , i 'd be saying @entity24 's every day until april			1
consequently , i propose that from here out we need to come together in a bipartisan fashion -- as a lesson to our dysfunctional @entity109 -- and stop with @entity14 's wishes after the first seven days of the year			2
if someone does offer you such a greeting two or three weeks into the @entity14 , do n't be rude , simply explain that it 's like wishing someone @entity114 on february 18 in time , hopefully we 'll all be on the same page on this issue			2
however , even if you are reading this after january 7 , i still sincerely wish you , and your family , a very happy and healthy @entity14			0
but this is the very last time i will say that in 2013			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity125 .			2

@entity125 : you can stop saying @entity24 now . it 's tacky and too late
even @entity20 of @entity131 *president* said after the first week , stop
he says we do n't say @entity6 or @entity135 when those holidays are over
@entity125 : it gets *progressively* more insincere . lets agree to cut off the greeting at 7 days
