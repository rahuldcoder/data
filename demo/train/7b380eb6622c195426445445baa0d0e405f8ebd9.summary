-- @entity1 kept the pressure on @entity4 title rivals @entity3 and @entity5 with a dominant victory over @entity7 -- and heaped more trouble on the defending champions			1
@entity11 striker @entity10 grabbed his first hat trick for @entity1 to seal a 3 - 1 win sunday which edged @entity1 to within two points of league leaders @entity3			1
@entity7 had started strongly at @entity16 and the opening strike from @entity10 , which took a heavy deflection , came against the run of play			1
@entity7 pressed on and both @entity22 teenage winger @entity21 and @entity24 striker @entity23 came close to equalizing but it was effectively game over when @entity10 pounced again on the stroke of halftime , poking in @entity31 's cross			1
the pair combined again after the break , with @entity10 dinking in @entity31 's rebounded header before dancing away to celebrate his hat - trick			1
the home side took their foot off the gas in the closing stages of the match and @entity41 slid in to grab a consolation goal for @entity7			1
but @entity7 boss @entity43 could only roll his eyes in despair when his captain @entity46 was shown a straight red card for a late challenge on @entity49 in the closing seconds of the match			2
@entity1 's victory also brought up 100 epl victories for manager @entity54 in just 142 matches			1
the feisty @entity57 manager might be pleased to know that he has ticked off 100 @entity4 wins faster than his old rival sir @entity58 , who needed 162 matches in charge of @entity7 to reach the milestone			1
for @entity7 , who are seventh in the table and 14 points off @entity3 's lead , and @entity43 , victory over their chief rivals would be tonic enough for now			1
" of course 100 matches is nice , it 's one more fantastic thing for my career , " @entity54 told broadcaster @entity69			2
" but the most important thing is to win the match			0
" it now opens a little gap between us , @entity7 and @entity79 and we are in contact with @entity3 and @entity5			1
" commenting on the title defense , @entity43 added : " it 's a long way away			0

@entity85 are unbeaten in the @entity4 since @entity95 replaced @entity96 at the helm while @entity90 , under the leadership of @entity99 , have now gone eight league games without a win and hover near the drop zone			2
@entity103 threw away a golden chance to take the lead in the @entity107 league as they settled for a draw with @entity109			2
@entity110 found his scoring boots again to fire the home side into the lead only for a rash challenge from @entity115 to undo his good work			0
the defender pulled back @entity109 's @entity118 in the box late on and @entity120 coolly slotted the resulting penalty beyond the reaching fingertips of keeper @entity123 @entity103 stay second behind @entity125 champions @entity124 , who were also held to a 1 - 1 draw by @entity128			1
@entity129 headed the home side into the lead in the first half only for @entity133 to do likewise at the opposite end of the pitch to level the score			0
@entity124 , who welcomed star man @entity138 back for his first league start of 2014 , poured forward but the home side dug in and delivered a defensive display which earned them a share of the points , a result which the @entity128 home fans joyously celebrated like a victory			2
the @entity107 league is proving to be as fiercely fought as the @entity4 with @entity124 and @entity103 both on 51 points with @entity150 one point further back			1
at least in @entity152 @entity151 can bask five points clear at the top of @entity155 following a 5 - 0 thrashing of @entity157			1
@entity160 centre - back @entity158 opened the scoring for @entity151 after just 10 minutes and the league 's top scorer @entity162 soon doubled their advantage from the penalty spot			2
@entity166 and @entity167 got on the scoresheet before star striker @entity162 sealed the rout			0
@entity171 ticked off a 2 - 0 win over @entity173 thanks to goals from @entity175 and @entity176			0
the victory for @entity179 's men kept them within touching distance of @entity151			2
" it 's an important win but we need to back it up , " @entity179 said			0
" we had n't played well in our last two matches and it 's good for the group 's confidence to rediscover winning ways			0
" it was an anxious wait for new @entity191 coach @entity190 but the player - turned - coach had @entity193 to thank for making it a winning start to his management career			0
