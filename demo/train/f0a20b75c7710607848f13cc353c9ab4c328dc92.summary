@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 said wednesday that his country will adopt a series of austerity measures promised to the @entity7 , as officials try to allay investor fears and head off a eurozone debt crisis			1
@entity11 , the embattled @entity3 premier who has offered his resignation , is expected to step down shortly after the measures are approved			1
after the @entity3 @entity15 passes reforms meant to address the country 's long - term fiscal health and its broader effect on global markets , either an interim government will be formed or elections called , the president said			1
@entity3 authorities say that if officials opt for elections , they would take place in january and likely result in a new government by february , at the earliest			1
the prime minister would typically remain in office until a transition takes place , though mounting market fears have raised questions about whether lawmakers might take swifter action			2
investor confidence plummeted wednesday when the yield on 10 - year @entity3 government bonds rose above 7 % , the level at which other @entity41 countries -- including @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 -- have sought international bailouts			1
the bond yields -- which represent the level of risk of lending @entity3 money -- surged to their highest levels since the euro was launched in 1999			1
the move , analysts say , could suggest that @entity3 may need more than a change in leadership to address investor concerns			1
but @entity3 lawmakers , for their part , could approve the new austerity measures as early as saturday , officials say , compelling @entity11 to resign shortly thereafter			1
the heart of the measures , said finance minister @entity64 , would increase the pension age by two years to 67 in 2026 , sell state property , invest in infrastructure and liberalize portions of the @entity3 economy , privatizing some state - owned businesses			1
the moves are meant to address the country 's soaring â ‚ ¬ 1.9 trillion debt load , which is nearly six times that of @entity42			1
as attention focused on @entity3 , the head of the @entity76 painted a stark picture of the challenges facing the world 's economic stability			1
" the global economy has entered a dangerous and uncertain phase , " @entity82 said in remarks prepared for delivery at the @entity85 in @entity86			2
" if we do not act , and act together , we could enter a downward spiral of uncertainty , financial instability and a collapse in global demand			0
ultimately , we could face a lost decade of low growth and high unemployment , " she said			0
although she made no specific mention of @entity3 in the prepared remarks , @entity82 spoke as even more bad news came from @entity0			1
@entity3 has been under pressure from investors and its trading partners to get its fiscal house in order			1
the nation has debts equal to about 120 % of its overall output and an economy that has been stagnant for years			0
@entity113 stocks , meanwhile , sold off sharply after @entity3 's bond yield spiked , with the @entity116 industrial average tumbling 3 %			1
@entity41 markets also sold off and the euro slumped nearly 2 % against the @entity113 dollar			0
on tuesday , @entity11 won a parliamentary vote approving a new budget that includes austerity measures sought by international lenders , but lost his majority in parliament			1
@entity11 later said he would resign , and on wednesday his spokesman , @entity126 , said @entity11 would not run in the country 's next parliamentary elections			1
in recent weeks , international concern has focused increasingly on @entity3 , the third - largest economy in the eurozone , as analysts have worried that the financial crisis centered in @entity42 could spread			1
at a meeting wednesday of the @entity15 in @entity137 , @entity135 deputy prime minister @entity134 described the pace at which the bad news has been accumulating			2
" i can not remember a time when events in @entity41 moved so swiftly			0
many hoped that , by now , we would no longer be lurching from one headline to the next			0
but the focus has shifted from @entity147 to @entity0 , and it is clear that much still needs to be done to ensure stability in the eurozone , " he said			0
" today i do not intend to provide further commentary on these specific events			0
for one thing , it would probably be out of date by the time i sat down , " he added			0
" @entity41 is suffering from a crisis of competitiveness , " @entity134 said , issuing a challenge to @entity7 nations			0
" the choice is stark : reform or wither			0
reform now or regret it forever			0
" for now , analysts are keeping their focus largely on @entity3			1
although the country is solvent , it holds a huge debt pile , and investors fear it may not be able to sustain that level of borrowing			2
@entity3 is the world 's eighth - largest economy			1
a meltdown would send shock waves through the global economy			0
analysts say the problem is a lack of investor confidence , rather than solvency , which is plaguing debt - laden eurozone neighbors like @entity42			2
" this is a crisis of confidence , not of fundamentals , " said @entity184 , currency strategist at @entity185			0
" @entity3 's debt level is sustainable , but it needs to implement policies that will support economic growth			1
" though the timing of @entity11 's resignation is unclear , news of his imminent departure signaled the end of an era in @entity3 politics			1
the 75 - year - old business tycoon has been a dominant force since forming his @entity203 party in 1994			0
he has weathered many crises , including sex scandals and corruption trials , in his three terms in office			0
but the loss of his parliamentary majority -- and with it his ability to command the government -- was a blow from which @entity11 could not recover			2
a senate budget commission is soon expected to vote on the measure			0
@entity11 told @entity3 newspaper @entity216 that his decision gives him freedom			1
" i will not put myself up for elections , " he told the newspaper			2
" actually , i feel liberated			0
now it is time for @entity221			0
he will be our premier candidate			0
he is extremely good , much better than one can expect , and his leadership has been accepted by all			0
" @entity11 was referring to former justice minister @entity221 , who has been known as his hand - picked successor			2
but others are expected to seek to replace @entity11			0
names being floated include political figures such as @entity230 , @entity11 's chief of staff , and @entity232 , a former commissioner with the @entity7			2
president @entity2 announced wednesday that he had nominated @entity232 as " senator for life , " a title bestowed on those who have held distinguished roles , raising speculation about his candidacy			0
a @entity242 - trained economist and professor at @entity245 's @entity244 , @entity232 has also worked as an international adviser to the investment firm @entity247			2
dubbed " @entity251 " for his work in international finance , the former @entity7 commissioner gained notoriety for his role in blocking a merger between @entity113 firms @entity255 and @entity257 , thought to be a move that highlighted @entity41 's newfound regulatory clout			2
other business figures such as @entity261 , chairman of @entity263 , and @entity264 , former ceo of @entity3 's largest bank , @entity266 , are also considered candidates			1
@entity1 's @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 and @entity274 contributed to this report .			0
