-- a quote often attributed to @entity2 reads , " you may not be interested in war , but war is interested in you			2
" although @entity7 would like very much to ignore @entity8 , @entity6 has just brought @entity2 's axiom into the 21st century with a seminal cyberattack that will have an immediate economic and cultural impact			1
on wednesday , the @entity13 government reportedly concluded that @entity8 was " centrally involved " in the hacking of @entity15			1
the attack is believed to have involved stealing and publicizing emails between high - level @entity15 executives and talent , as well as at least two government officials			2
when combined with a threat of violence against would - be viewers of a comedy mocking the @entity8 dictator @entity23 , @entity6 's hackers effected the cancellation of the movie 's release			1
more than just costing @entity15 as much as $ 100 million by some estimates , the cancellation and other fallout from the hack attack will likely end careers in @entity36 and @entity37 and put a chill on creative satires or other media aimed at dictatorships			0
a @entity36 that already increasingly toadied repressive governments like @entity43 's may now be completely defanged			0
what happens in film also affects music , publishing and the news media			0
using modest cybercapabilities and an @entity13 - @entity51 target wholly lacking in moral courage , @entity8 has aided itself and every other dictatorship on @entity54 mightily			1
@entity7 has developed a de facto policy of ignoring @entity8 , especially after talks to disarm that nation failed during the @entity59 administration			1
in 2010 , after @entity8 sank a @entity62 ship , president @entity60 said @entity6 must be " held to account			1
" in 2013 , after @entity8 's third nuclear test , president @entity60 vowed " swift and credible " action			1
but aside from the umpteenth condemnation by the @entity67 -- to which @entity8 is indifferent -- the world mostly goes back to ignoring @entity6 after headlines change			1
but in this case , ignorance is n't bliss			0
this year alone , @entity8 has fired shells toward @entity73 , apparently engaged in illicit arms transfers with @entity75 , and is suspected by @entity13 's top general in @entity73 of potentially having developed the skill to weaponize the nuclear devices it has been working on			1
then , of course , came @entity6 's cyberattack on @entity15 , a remarkable feat in a country where internet access is tightly controlled and there is no commercial software market to create a private supply of programmers			0
the state reportedly makes up for this by employing its own small army of hackers , who according to defectors train in @entity95 and @entity43 , and even operate from abroad			0
the free world should react			0
responding to cyberattacks is a new area for statecraft , but ought to be seen in the same light as dealing with any other nonlethal attack on a nation 's economic or security interests			1
first , the @entity13 and its allies should retaliate against their attackers in order to deter future attacks			1
the response should be similar to , but of a greater magnitude than the initial attack -- a common feature of deterrence			0
second , the @entity13 should maintain escalatory dominance , making clear that it is always willing and able to ascend to the next higher level of conflict if so forced			1
a direct cyber-retaliation against @entity8 may pose challenges ; the nation is less networked and less reliant on intellectual property than free nations			1
but any modern communications system has vulnerabilities that can be exploited			0
furthermore , @entity8 's two alleged primary cyberenablers , @entity95 and @entity43 , could be covertly targeted with electronic means for aiding an attack on the @entity13			1
for example , the @entity13 could disrupt communications or even the electricity grid in @entity6 and temporarily disrupt a small number of @entity43 or @entity95 firms that depend on web commerce			1
taking steps like these may require transforming the young @entity136 from an extra tool for @entity13 military commanders in a regular war into an agency that fights more in peacetime			2
sometimes the best defense is a good offense			0
in this way , cyberwar and deterrence could come to resemble espionage - related contests during the @entity148			0
one side responds to provocations with counterprovocations			0
an understanding and an unwritten code of conduct develops among adversaries			0
short - term stability is generally achieved , pending further resolution that is hopefully peaceful and conducted at our initiative -- like the end of the @entity148			0
but with @entity8 we should go further still , ceasing ever again to ignore the regime			2
ultimately , improved cybersecurity will only come with the regime 's replacement			0
freedom and accountable government work for @entity8 , a fact that is obvious from the shining example of @entity73			2
helping @entity8 replicate this by peacefully replacing the @entity23 dynasty ought to be the free world 's primary goal on the @entity174			2
ironically , one of the best ways to achieve this change is with the type of cultural and electronic warfare @entity8 has just waged against us			2
supporting the free flow of information back into @entity8 -- especially by defectors who can encourage and explain the truth to the repressed @entity8 they left behind -- is a proven way of eroding tyrannical regimes			2
it will also put @entity6 on the defensive at home -- fully aware that it is no longer being ignored .			0
