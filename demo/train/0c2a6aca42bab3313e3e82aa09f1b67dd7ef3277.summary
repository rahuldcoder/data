-- cyclist @entity2 was part of " the most sophisticated , professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen , " the @entity1 said wednesday in releasing more than 1,000 pages of evidence in the case			1
the evidence involving the @entity12 - sponsored cycling team encompasses " direct documentary evidence including financial payments , e-mails , scientific data and laboratory test results that further prove the use , possession and distribution of performance - enhancing drugs by @entity2 , " the agency said			1
@entity2 lawyer @entity22 dismissed what he called a " one - sided hatchet job " and a " government - funded witch hunt " against the seven - time @entity27 winner , who has consistently denied doping accusations			1
@entity2 teammates recount dodging , tricking drug testers but the @entity1 said 11 riders came forward to acknowledge their use of banned performance - enhancing drugs while on the team			1
among them is @entity36 , @entity2 's close teammate during his winning @entity27 runs			1
" i 'm not suggesting that they are all lying , but i am suggesting that each witness needs to have confrontation and cross examination to test the accuracy of their recollection , " @entity22 said			0
the @entity1 is sending its " reasoned decision " to the international governing body of cycling , the @entity47 , as well as the @entity48 and the @entity49 , which runs @entity51 competitions			0
highlights of the @entity2 report in the past , @entity2 argued that he has taken more than 500 drug tests and never failed			1
in its 202 - page report , the @entity1 said it had tested @entity2 less than 60 times and the @entity47 conducted about 215 tests			1
" thus the number of actual controls on mr. @entity2 over the years appears to have been considerably fewer than the number claimed by @entity2 and his lawyers , " the @entity1 said			2
the agency did n't say that @entity2 ever failed one of those tests , only that his former teammates testified as to how they beat tests or avoided the test administrators altogether			1
several riders also said team officials seemed to know when random drug tests were coming , the report said			1
the agency also said it had a professor compare @entity2 's red cell and plasma levels from blood samples taken late in his career , and they showed levels that would n't be expected of an athlete competing in a three - week endurance event like the @entity27			1
what 's behind the @entity2 headlines @entity36 publicly admitted for the first time wednesday that he took drugs			1
" early in my professional career , it became clear to me that , given the widespread use of performance - enhancing drugs by cyclists at the top of the profession , it was not possible to compete at the highest level without them , " @entity36 said in a written statement			1
" i deeply regret that choice and sincerely apologize to my family , teammates and fans			0
" @entity36 testified , the report said , that he was aware of @entity2 's use of the drug @entity103 , or erythropoietin , which boosts the number of red blood cells , which carry oxygen to the muscles , and his use of blood transfusions			1
he also testified @entity2 dropped out of a race in 2000 to avoid a positive drug test , according to the report , which was accompanied by hundred of pages of supporting documents like @entity36 's 16 - page affidavit			1
three members of the @entity12 team , which changed sponsors in 2005 , will contest the accusations , the agency said			0
they are team director @entity123 , team doctor @entity124 and team trainer @entity125			0
each will get a hearing before an independent judge , according to the agency			0
the agency compiled the evidence as part of its investigation into doping allegations that have dogged @entity2 and the @entity12 team for years			2
the organization is not a governmental agency but is designated by @entity138 as the country 's official anti-doping organization for @entity142 sports			0
in august , four days after a federal judge dismissed @entity2 's lawsuit seeking to block the agency 's investigation , @entity2 announced he would no longer fight the accusations			1
the agency then announced it would ban @entity2 from the sport for life and strip him of his results dating from 1998			2
" when mr. @entity2 refused to confront the evidence against him in a hearing before neutral arbitrators , he confirmed the judgment that the era in professional cycling which he dominated as the patron of the peloton was the dirtiest ever , " the @entity1 writes in its decision			2
" peloton " refers to the main group of riders in a bike race			0
@entity2 : it 's time to move forward the agency praised the 11 riders who came forward to document the widespread use of banned substances by the team			2
but in a statement issued wednesday afternoon , attorney @entity22 called the expected @entity1 report " a taxpayer - funded tabloid piece rehashing old , disproved , unreliable allegations , based largely on axe - grinders , serial perjurers , coerced testimony , sweetheart deals and threat - induced stories			2
" in addition to @entity36 , the agency identified the cyclists who came forward as @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193			0
the agency said those riders would receive various punishments , including suspensions and disqualifications			0
the scope of evidence against the team is " overwhelming , " according to the agency			0
" the @entity205 doping conspiracy was professionally designed to groom and pressure athletes to use dangerous drugs , to evade detection , to ensure its secrecy and ultimately gain an unfair competitive advantage through superior doping practices , " the agency said			0
your @entity2 questions answered @entity2 became a household name not only in @entity215 , where cycling is wildly popular , but also in the @entity217 , where the sport traditionally attracted little attention before he embarked on a remarkable stretch between 1999 and 2005 and won seven consecutive @entity27 titles			2
persistent accusations that he used performance - enhancing drugs grew as he won more tours			1
author and cycling journalist @entity225 compared the case to baseball 's " @entity234 " scandal , when eight @entity231 players conspired with gamblers to throw the @entity233			0
but he said @entity2 is " not interested in ever admitting to his guilt , and he just wants to move on right now			2
" " despite this evidence and despite all the evidence that has come out , he 's got a strong core of people who believe in him and will always believe in him because of his link to fighting cancer , " said @entity225 , who chronicled @entity2 's 2009 return to the @entity27 in a 2011 book			1
opinion : @entity2 and the tenuous nature of heroism but how @entity2 might move on is unclear			2
" certainly , he 's not going to be able to move on within the sport , " @entity225 told @entity0			0
" it seems likely that all of his tour victories will be stripped			0
he wo n't be allowed to participate in any sports that are signatories of @entity48 , the @entity48			0
but he 's found a few triathlons to do in the meantime			0
" and he said the allegations could lead to the reopening of a criminal case against @entity2 that federal prosecutors closed without charges in february			2
" what 's next is years and years of fighting if the criminal case is reopened , " @entity225 said			0
the @entity1 opened its own case , which does not carry criminal penalties , in june			0
@entity2 's cancer foundation still strong			1

@entity2 has long denied using performance - enhancing drugs
