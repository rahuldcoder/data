-- @entity1 hanged two men at the end of january -- the first political prisoners known to be executed in @entity1 since the demonstrations protesting the re-election of president @entity6 , according to @entity7			1
it 's still not entirely clear what @entity9 and @entity11 's crime was			2
@entity9 's lawyer said he was already in jail on election day in june 2009 , so he could n't have been involved in the post-election uprising , she said			2
but whatever their earthly crimes were , the two men executed last month were also accused of another offense far more serious than simply protesting against a government			1
they were convicted of being " mohareb , " enemies of @entity25			1
that is the worst possible crime in @entity28 law , according to @entity29 , the director of @entity1 studies at @entity31			1
the legal implications are clear , he said			0
" a mohareb , according to @entity28 law , is executed , " he said			1
that the regime is labeling its opponents enemies of @entity25 is a sign of how rattled it is by the protests , he said			1
" they were completely caught off guard by the ferocity and extent of the opposition and they pulled out all the stops , " he said			0
traditional accusations did not succeed in intimidating the protesters , he said			2
" they accused them of working in cahoots with the @entity52 and @entity53			0
when it did n't work , they said you are mohareb , " he said			2
legally , there 's nowhere for the government to escalate from here , he added			0
" i ca n't imagine them upping the legal ante , " he said			0
" what you can do is increase the number of people they are executing in an in - your - face manner to bring terror to the people			0
" in fact , at least one other person is on death row for being a mohareb , according to the @entity75 as quoted by the semi-official @entity76			1
labeling opponents of the government " enemies of @entity25 " is a relatively new tactic , said @entity1 journalist @entity81 , who argued that religious tolerance was more traditionally @entity1			1
" it was not like that the beginning of the revolution			0
the revolution was an @entity88 revolution but they did not try to give a religious aspect , " he told @entity0 's @entity87			0
" now unfortunately they are giving a very dangerous and arguably @entity93 religious aspect to it by hating the @entity95 , hating the @entity96 , [ using ] anti-christian propaganda , executing or even murdering some @entity99 preachers , " said @entity81 , who fled @entity1 after the revolution			1
the religious intolerance " is really completely new and this is one of the ugliest aspects " of the current regime , he said			0
@entity29 said that even ayatollah @entity104 , the founder of the @entity88 regime , did not accuse his opponents of being enemies of @entity25			1
" in the early days of the revolution , @entity104 threatened to declare these people as mohareb , but i do n't remember them ever passing a law that says if you go out and demonstrate , you are a mohareb , " @entity29 said			2
@entity104 leveled a different charge at his opponents , calling them " mofsed fel - @entity113 , " or he who brings corruption , @entity29 said			2
the charge was " introduced by @entity104 , and they killed thousands of people , but at that time even @entity104 was averse " to describing his opponents as mohareb , he said			1
using it now implicitly " beatifies @entity104 , " @entity29 said			0
" they are making him a god			0
" it also could be a sign of panic on the part of the authorities , he said			0
" it takes a lot of ... political insecurity to say if you do n't do something i tell you to do , you are an enemy of @entity25 , " he said .			1

those convicted of being " mohareb , " enemies of @entity25 , are executed
two men convicted of the charge were hanged in january , another faces death
