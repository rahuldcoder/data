-- in the quiet world of @entity3 politics , outspoken @entity5 leader and @entity7 's main challenger , @entity6 , is causing something of a storm			1
first there was the @entity12 blooper : he referred to @entity14 and @entity15 as the " two clowns who have won the @entity12 election			2
" @entity18 , wir koennen ! can @entity20 - style campaign work in @entity3 ? admittedly one of the two , @entity14 , had been a successful comedian before turning to politics			0
but still , the comment caused @entity12 president @entity25 to cancel an official engagement in @entity3			0
then there was the interview with the @entity30 newspaper , in which he claimed the @entity3 chancellor 's salary was too low for his liking -- which may not be the wisest comment if you are running for the post			2
interactive : who is running in @entity3 election ? he then raised eyebrows even further by claiming @entity7 was getting extra political points for being female			1
and finally , there was that photograph : a portrait of the nation 's would - be leader , raising his middle finger to the camera			1
on the cover of the @entity51 , one of @entity3 's most widely - read newspapers			2
@entity6 's nicknames range from " @entity56 " to " @entity55			1
" still , they signal an improvement from the early days of the election campaign , when only a few would have recognized him at all			2
although he had served as a federal minister in the past , he is currently a rank - and - file mp			1
and when you 're trying to get noticed , even bad publicity is better than none			0
could euroskeptics spoil @entity7 's election party ? an economist by trade , @entity6 grew up in @entity70 and joined the political ranks shortly after graduating from university			1
he is an accomplished politician , having served as minister - president of @entity74 , before moving into the federal sphere			1
@entity7 , his rival in the election race , was once his boss : he served as finance minister in her first government , from 2005 until 2009 : as @entity81 collapsed and the @entity83 crisis started to bite , his political star rose			1
a sharp critic of the shadow banking system , he was responsible for @entity3 's bank rescue plan			2
" he has a reputation as an efficient manager of the fiscal crisis , " writes researcher @entity87			0
that , however , may not be viewed entirely positively by potential voters			0
" he does not define himself by making overly empathetic social statements , " @entity87 writes			0
" quite the contrary , many social democratic activists regard him as a cold - hearted , pro-business technocrat			0
" is @entity3 playing beggar - my - neighbor with the eurozone ? in the @entity99 election manifesto , he does promise to establish state - wide minimum wage and increase tax rates for top earners -- proposals rejected firmly by @entity7			1
but his critics argue that his promises do n't come across as particularly honest , and he lacks popularity			0
" his public persona is [ one of ] perceived arrogance and [ a ] lack of connection with low - income households , " says political scientist @entity107			0
that is not good news for his party , the @entity99			0
with a leader perceived by many as conservative , more voters appear to be shunning the @entity99 in favor of the more " radically " socialist party , @entity119			1
@entity7 : @entity121 's mrs. @entity120 observers say that throughout the campaign , @entity6 has been everything @entity7 is not : cheeky , spontaneous , impulsive			1
but women in particular are not amused by his style , with 70 % of female voters finding the middle finger incident " very bad , " according to a @entity130 poll			0
@entity6 and his wife @entity131 , a former teacher ( the couple has three children ) , have given joint interviews in an effort to boost his image among women			2
moreover , his coalition past and image as a hard pro-business economist might deter the voters who are otherwise attracted to his personality			0
with polls predicting his party will secure just 26 % of votes , he can not afford to lose any more support thanks to further gaffes .			1

@entity5 leader @entity6 is @entity7 's main rival in the election race
he served as finance minister in @entity7 's first coalition government from 2005 to 2009
the polls are predicting his party 26 % of votes , he will need coalition *partners* if he wants to govern
