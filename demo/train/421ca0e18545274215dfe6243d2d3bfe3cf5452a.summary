@entity0 -- a dispute over abortion between the only remaining @entity4 in @entity5 and his roman catholic bishop has highlighted the political volatility of the issue and the challenge it presents to the nation 's @entity10			1
" how can you claim to be a @entity13 and also support abortion ? " bishop @entity15 of @entity16 , @entity17 , asked monday , discussing his request that rep. @entity4 , a @entity17 @entity19 , stop receiving @entity20 because of his pro-choice politics			1
@entity4 went public sunday about @entity15 's request , originally made in a private letter to @entity4 in 2007			1
@entity15 responded with a statement sunday followed by his television appearance monday , in which he acknowledged holding @entity4 to a higher standard than an ordinary parishioner because of the congressman 's position as a legislator who can shape abortion laws and policy			1
the issue is considered much broader than a public rift between the two men			1
a sweeping health care bill in @entity5 could get derailed by conflicts over abortion language , with the @entity39 last week criticizing a @entity41 version of the measure for lacking the tougher language adopted earlier by the @entity44			2
@entity4 , a member of the most influential @entity13 family in @entity47 history , is the son of the late sen. @entity48 and nephew of the late @entity50 , the nation 's first @entity13 president			1
when running for president in 1960 , @entity50 famously said he was " not the @entity13 candidate for president , " but " the @entity55 's candidate for president who also happens to be be a @entity13			2
" @entity48 was known for his liberal policies , including support for a woman 's right to choose an abortion			1
when he died earlier this year , a @entity61 was held in @entity63 's @entity62			2
@entity4 holds similar views to his late father , and the dispute with @entity15 festered anew when @entity4 publicly criticized the @entity10 for opposing health care reform that lacked stringent anti-abortion language			1
requests to @entity4 's offices in @entity0 and @entity17 for comment monday went unanswered			1
@entity15 , appearing on @entity1 , called @entity4 's support of abortion " a scandal			1
" asked why he was singling out @entity4 , @entity15 said the congressman started the dispute by attacking the church 's opposition to a health care bill that lacks tough abortion restrictions			1
he acknowledged " a difference between someone who is the average @entity13 in the pew ... and someone like the congressman who is in a high - profile position and is in a position to affect legislation on allowing access to abortion			0
" other catholics questioned @entity15 's stance			0
" the simple fact is that most bishops do n't want to deny communion to politicians , and we know for a fact that @entity102 gave communion to pro-choice @entity105 politicians , " said the rev. @entity93 , a senior fellow at the @entity94 at @entity95			0
" so the question is , is @entity107 more catholic than the pope on this ? " politicians have previously run afoul of catholic bishops on the abortion issue			2
@entity113 archbishop @entity112 asked @entity115 secretary @entity114 to stop receiving communion when she was a pro-choice governor of @entity113 , and former @entity118 archbishop @entity117 said in 2004 he would deny communion to @entity55 presidential candidate @entity120 for being pro-choice			0
@entity121 , a longtime @entity122 pastor who has written a book coming out next year called " @entity124 of @entity122 , " said politicizing religious views limits the perception and , eventually , the impact of a church 's teachings			2
" both @entity10 and @entity130 have allowed themselves to be pushed into this kind of binary , either - or thinking " on abortion and homosexuality , @entity121 said			0
" it 's disturbing for me as a @entity136 to see the @entity10 possibly risking its moral authority on a number of other issues by only focusing on abortion			2
" the @entity10 strongly opposes abortion , which has been legal across the @entity47 since 1973			0
the @entity39 lobbied for tight restrictions on federal funding of abortion in the health care bill the @entity44 passed earlier this month			0
in an october interview , @entity4 criticized the bishops for threatening to oppose the health care bill if it lacked the tough restrictions			2
in the @entity44 debate on the measure , @entity4 opposed a provision with the church - backed restrictions on federal money for abortions , but voted in favor of final passage of the bill that included that language			1
he repeated that criticism and revealed @entity15 's earlier admonition in an interview published sunday , the 46th anniversary of the assassination of @entity50			2
@entity15 responded by calling @entity4 's position " unacceptable to the church and scandalous to many of our members			1
" most bishops and priests oppose using communion as a " political weapon , " and @entity4 's disclosure of @entity15 's admonition may be an attempt to push back against the bishops ' support for the abortion restrictions in the @entity44 bill , @entity1 senior @entity171 analyst @entity170 said			1
" the catholic bishops have been fairly successful , at least to date , at putting abortion at the center of the debate over health care reform , and that obviously has generated some resentment from people who do n't share their views , " @entity170 said			0
@entity4 's decision to come forward " in effect puts the @entity13 bishops in a negative light , because it ends up making them look intolerant			1
" to @entity198 , the admonishment by @entity15 displays an inconsistency			0
" the bishops have taken i think a wise stand against the proliferation of nuclear weapons , " he said			0
" would they apply withholding of the @entity204 to someone who supports increasing nuclear stockpiles ? " the health care debate reveals the depth of division on the issue , according to @entity198			0
both sides apparently believe they are advocating language that makes the legislation effectively " abortion neutral , " meaning it does n't change existing abortion law			0
" what we discovered is ' abortion neutral ' is a matter of interpretation , " @entity121 said , adding : " this is what happens in the politics of polarization			0
each side plays to its more extreme base			0
it makes common ground and respectful dialogue harder to achieve			0
the idea that we 're playing a win - lose game , that you 're saying if you do n't agree with us , we 're not even going to have a conversation with you , that attitude chills civil discourse			0
