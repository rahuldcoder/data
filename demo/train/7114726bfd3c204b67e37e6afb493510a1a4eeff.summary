cunning wolf ? working class hero ? or bland @entity3 loyalist ? @entity4 , the @entity5 leader whose resignation has become a rallying cry for the protesters that have filled the city 's streets this week , was a relative unknown before he took the top job in 2012			1
as the son of a policeman who has used the same briefcase since his student days , his supporters said he would improve the lot of ordinary people in a city that has one of the world 's widest wealth gaps			1
" he wanted to present himself as someone from the grassroots , not linked to the tycoons ... but people have been terribly disappointed , " says @entity25 , a professor of political science at @entity27			0
it 's @entity4 's failure to make progress on the universal suffrage that was promised to the city under the terms of its 1997 handover to @entity39 that has rankled @entity40 most , bringing tens of thousands of them onto the streets in recent days			1
@entity3 lackey ? one of his nicknames is " 689 " -- a sarcastic reference to the number of votes he obtained from the city 's 1,200 - strong election committee , a group of people selected from the largely pro-beijing elite			1
and @entity4 , a former surveyor and real estate consultant , has done little to dispel the prevailing view that he is @entity3 's lackey			1
a day after being elected as chief executive he paid a visit to the central government liaison office , @entity3 's outpost in the city and he was the first leader to make his inauguration speech in @entity65 -- rather than the cantonese that is spoken by most people in this former @entity69 colony			1
" he is in daily communication with @entity3 , " says @entity70 , an adjunct professor at the @entity71			2
" @entity4 is a very obedient cadre			0
" despite this , @entity4 was not in fact @entity3 's first choice to become chief executive			1
the early favorite was @entity79 , a bumbling former financial secretary best known for his penchant for red wine			0
but revelations that @entity79 's home had an enormous basement which had n't been approved for planning permission , dubbed an underground palace , derailed his campaign			0
however , it was later discovered that @entity4 's home in the city 's exclusive @entity91 neighborhood also had an illegal structure			1
@entity4 declared ignorance but it undermined trust in the city 's new leader from the get - go and helped earn him another nickname -- " wolf			1
" the moniker sounds similar in cantonese to his family name but also suggests a cunning political operator			0
his approval ratings have plummeted since 2012 and a plush toy wolf made by @entity107 sold out across the city earlier this year as @entity40 , eager to use it as a tongue - in - cheek symbol of protest , snapped it up			0
a gigantic , enlarged effigy of @entity4 's head , replete with lupine fangs , has also been a distinctive sight on the streets during the protests			2
villain ? for all his colorful nicknames , @entity122 , political cartoonist at the @entity123 , the city 's main @entity120 - language newspaper , says @entity4 is a difficult character to portray			1
" @entity4 , despite his pantomime villain appearance , has n't really turned out to be all that cartoonable , " he told @entity126			0
" i 've hardly featured him in any cartoons for months now			0
" those that do usually feature @entity4 sitting in his office with a picture of malevolent panda -- symbolizing @entity39 -- behind him			2
the reason , says @entity122 , is that @entity4 is rarely out and about and has little public presence , coming across as aloof			0
his unease with ordinary members of the public has been on display this week			0
@entity4 has only appeared in public three times ; twice for press conferences and once for a @entity147 flag - raising ceremony attended by dignitaries			0
protest leaders have repeatedly called for him to go and refuse to negotiate with him , preferring a meeting with his number two -- @entity152			0
while @entity4 says he will not resign , many observers feel his days are numbered , with protesters setting up a makeshift tomb at the protest site			2
" @entity3 would ... lose face if they were to sack @entity4 in the near future , " says @entity70 at the @entity71			1
but " it 's a foregone conclusion that @entity4 has to go because he is a very divisive and very unpopular figure			2

@entity4 was relatively unknown before taking @entity5 's top job in 2012
chief executive portrays himself as a man of people but does not enjoy popular support
many in the city believe he is @entity3 's lackey
protester leaders have **demand*ed* that he resign -- a *demand* as yet *unheeded*
