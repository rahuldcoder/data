-- musician @entity1 of @entity2 performed at a concert sponsored by @entity4 on the first night of the @entity5			2
before monday night 's show in @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity1 answered five questions for @entity0			2
@entity1 says it 's great to see his young fans get energized about the election when they ca n't even vote			2
@entity0 : what have you been doing in @entity7 ? have you been having any fun ? @entity1 : i have had a little bit of fun , but i only came in yesterday so we 've only been around a little bit			0
i think we 'll go out a little bit tonight , but then i think we go back to @entity22			0
then we 're going to watch most of the speeches and whatnot on tv and the computer			0
@entity0 : so what do the @entity28 need to do to win the @entity30 , do you think ? @entity1 : i actually learned this from the person i got tennis lessons from that @entity28 or the @entity34 need not only to win the @entity30 but you need to maintain the majority in the government in general in order to get things moving			0
@entity0 : as you 're meeting your fans , does it seem like people are pretty energized about this election ? @entity1 : yeah ... people are pretty excited about it			1
... i think [ even ] people that are n't even old enough to vote , which is what 's pretty exciting			0
a lot of the times we 're like , " well , some of the fans are really young , they ca n't even vote , " but it 's like they 're gon na be voting in the next election			0
i 'm personally excited when i see people who are so excited about it			1
ireport.com : are you at the @entity5 ? share sights and sounds @entity0 : @entity66 -- home base for the band			1
what 's the vibe that you 're getting there in @entity66 ? @entity1 : well , @entity66 's definitely pulling for @entity73			1
i think that that is because of @entity76 as a populace and also by virtue of @entity73 being from @entity66			1
and you know , hometown crowd 's the best , you know what i 'm saying ? @entity0 : and who are you voting for ? and @entity85 [ @entity86 ] ? @entity1 : well , probably the last thing my wife would do -- ever -- is tell me who she 's voting for , to be honest with you			1
but my guess would be that she votes pretty similarly to me .			0
