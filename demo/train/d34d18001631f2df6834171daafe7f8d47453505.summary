there 's a problem haunting the digital - coupon world : once people use a coupon , they usually do n't come back			0
but @entity6 , the young founder of a game - life app called @entity8 and one of the foremost thinkers on using technology to make life more of a game , says he has a fix for that			0
it 's an app called @entity17 , and it 's launching in two new cities -- @entity19 and @entity20 -- on wednesday , @entity6 said			1
" the data ( about the app 's use ) has been just so freaking off - the - charts amazing , " he said			0
in pilot cities where the app is already available -- @entity30 and @entity31 -- more than 40 % of the people who used the app to make a purchase came back to the same retail store within a month , @entity6 said			0
other coupon sites are reported to have lower return rates			0
a @entity36 spokeswoman declined to comment or provide statistics for this story			0
the difference with @entity17 , says @entity6 , is in ease of use and game mechanics			2
here 's how you use it : @entity17 users download an app and link it to a credit card			1
the app generates a unique @entity49 ( those black - and - white checkerboard things ) , which can be scanned at stores to make a payment and to earn @entity17 deals			1
this happens all at once			0
if you 're at the @entity56 in @entity31 , for example , and you pay with @entity17 , then you automatically get a $ 10 discount that 's offered through the app. compare that with @entity60 , which you have to buy in advance , print out and take with you to the store or restaurant			1
@entity17 works right in the moment			2
the app also builds in an incentive for you to return to that business			1
as its name suggests , customers " level up " when they make purchases , letting them unlock better and better deals as they return to a location over and over again			2
in the @entity56 example , you 'll earn a $ 20 discount after you 've spent a total of $ 150 at that restaurant			0
it 's a digital version of those punch - card coupons , but there 's not a paper card to lose , and it gets punched automatically when you pay with the app. the app is also toying with more game - like features in the future			1
this makes sense in part because @entity6 is also the founder of @entity8 , a real - world game app that takes users on scavenger hunts through parks , museums and businesses			2
if you take a friend to lunch and pay with the app , each of you gets a $ 5 coupon , for example			2
and , in the future , the company is working on a promotion called make it rain , in which you 'll get a special discount if you make a purchase at a @entity17 merchant while it 's raining in your city , since that 's when restaurants are slow			2
the app is adding social and game - like features slowly to avoid " the @entity117 dichotomy of doom , " he said , referring to a social site that lets users automatically share their credit card purchases on @entity122 , freaking many people out			1
it 's also worth noting that @entity17 does n't take a cut of your purchases , which , according to @entity6 , makes it a better deal for the businesses that use it			0
" the coolest part -- and there 's some magic here -- is that when you pay with @entity17 , the merchant actually pays about 50 % less in their payment processing fees than the card that you would have paid with in the first place , " he said			1
instead , he said , @entity17 charges participating businesses a monthly fee of $ 55 after an initial three - month trial period during which the service is free			0
the app has 100,000 users in @entity31 and @entity30 , he said , and @entity17 deals are available in about 500 businesses in those two test cities			1
about 800 businesses in @entity20 and @entity19 have signed up with the service , he said , but not all will be active at the time of the app 's launch in those cities wednesday			1
if you give the app a try , let us know what you think in the comments section .			0
