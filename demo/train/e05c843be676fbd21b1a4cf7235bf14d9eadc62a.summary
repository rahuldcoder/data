@entity0 -- film - making was not an obvious career path for the young @entity4			1
the daughter of @entity8 parents , she spent 16 years growing up in @entity9 -- " a country of no cinema , " she says -- where public movie theaters have been banned for more than three decades			2
@entity4 , who is also a poet , thought she wanted to write fiction , perhaps do screenwriting			0
but the possibility of film - making was not something that occurred to her until much later			2
just as well it did			0
the @entity22 - @entity8 director 's second feature film , " when i saw you , " has been winning awards at film festivals around the world , part of a wave of @entity29 women filmmakers recently gaining critical acclaim worldwide			1
having won prizes at film festivals in @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 , the film will have its @entity39 premiere next month in @entity0 at the @entity40 , an event devoted to championing women filmmakers and which is this year focusing on @entity29 cinema			1
among the films on the schedule - six features , nine documentaries , plenty of shorts -- is director @entity48 's feature debut " @entity54 " -- the first ever feature by a @entity9 woman , and the first feature film to be shot entirely in the conservative kingdom			2
" in the last couple of years we 've seen the sudden emergence of women from across the @entity29 region winning big awards at the international festivals , " said @entity56 , producer of @entity40 , which was founded in response to the fact that only about 10 % of movies worldwide are made by women			1
the week - long festival begins on april 3 in @entity0			1
watch : @entity9 film breaks boundaries set in @entity22 in 1967 , @entity4 's film tells the story of an 11 - year - old @entity8 refugee , @entity73 and his mother , displaced by war to the @entity76 in @entity22			0
" i was interested in the time period of the late ' 60s with the liberation movements -- the moment before everything went bad , everything got corrupt , " she said			0
" young people dreamed of a better world and had agency in their own lives			0
" @entity4 said that aside from funding possibly being harder to come by for women , she did not believe she encountered any particular obstacles related to her gender because , as a @entity22 - @entity8 director , she was creating films in a place without an established industry			1
" when you 're coming from a country in which everyone 's building up together , i do n't feel boxed in as a woman , " she said			0
" it 's much easier to work as a woman in a country that does n't have an established system the way @entity103 or @entity104 does , one that women have traditionally been left out of			0
" watch : a great year for @entity106 cinema recent interest in the @entity111 , as evidenced by the rise of film festivals in @entity34 and @entity109 , had led to increased funding opportunities , which she had taken advantage of for her second feature			1
" the @entity111 is interested in film and supporting filmmakers , " she said			1
" with my film , there was no censorship , there was no control of the subject -- that 's a concern for a lot of filmmakers when you take funds , especially from conservative countries			2
" @entity135 , a @entity136 director whose latest short " @entity133 ( one tuesday ) " won first prize in the short film category at the @entity131 and will be screening in the @entity40 line - up , agreed			0
" there have been @entity29 filmmakers for a long time ... it 's just that the film industry , whether for women or men , is one that is difficult because there 's no funding and you have to figure out your own manner of making films , " she said			1
even once films are made , filmmakers face obstacles , with distribution proving a particular challenge			0
while @entity4 's films gained theatrical releases in a number of western countries , she also wanted to share them with @entity22 and @entity8 move - goers			2
" your cast and crew are from that country , " said @entity4			0
" you hope there 's a broader audience but i think it 's really important to prioritize your own audience and share your film with them			0
" read also : man - made desert lake - bird - watcher 's paradise or ecological disaster ? but cinema owners in the region are often reluctant to support local films			2
" they say nobody wants to see local films , they want to see @entity104 films , " said @entity4 despite a positive reception at festivals , her first feature film did not gain theatrical release throughout the @entity29 world , leading her team to distribute the film themselves throughout the @entity186			1
it was then that she had encountered " the other problem for cinema in the @entity29 world " - piracy			1
" go into any dvd store and for one dinar , all these films are available , " she said			0
" i had dinner a recently with a friend of my mother 's and she said really innocently , ' i loved @entity197 , i found a copy of it then i made 100 copies and gave it to my friends			0
they do n't see how that hurts the filmmaker			0
" despite the obstacles faced in bringing their vision to the screens , @entity56 said the recent a success of @entity29 women filmmakers " was something incredibly exciting both within the industry and for audiences			1
" " both ( @entity4 and @entity214 ) come from countries that previously did n't have role models of women directors - hopefully that can encourage a new generation to express themselves			1
