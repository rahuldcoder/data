@entity0 -- it 's a story that mesmerized the nation and one that many observers thought ended more than two years ago			1
the case of @entity6 , a 24 - year - old @entity0 intern whose body was found in a @entity8 in 2002 , is back in court , but the actions of a @entity12 judge have given it a mysterious air			1
in a hearing thursday , judge @entity14 , along with an appeals court , maintained restrictions on the media 's ability to report on recent hearings in the case			1
@entity14 has ruled that the substantive details of hearings on december 18 , january 4 and at least one upcoming hearing remain under seal			1
when the sealed issues are discussed during the hearings , the lawyers and judge speak at the judge 's bench , and observers in the courtroom can not hear the conversations			1
the transcripts of those discussions are under seal			2
the judge 's ruling was a disappointment to a group of media outlets , including @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , the @entity46 and @entity47 , that had filed court papers seeking to unseal the information			1
" we 're very disappointed with the court leaving in place essentially blanket secrecy , " @entity50 , an attorney representing the media outlets , told reporters outside the courthouse			1
@entity50 predicted the secrecy surrounding hearings in the @entity6 case could last months			1
the man convicted of killing @entity6 made an appearance at a hearing on thursday			1
@entity64 , 31 , was led into the courtroom in handcuffs and an orange jumpsuit , sporting a large tattoo that covered most of his scalp			0
he conversed with a @entity71 translator throughout the proceeding , but did not participate in talks at the judge 's bench			2
despite @entity14 's restrictions on information , @entity1 has learned some key details of these unexpected hearings from @entity80 and court papers			2
" the court has stated that a ' somewhat substantial ' but unspecified concern about ' safety ' supports its decisions to close the proceedings to all members of the press and the public , " according to one court filing			0
it is not known to whose safety that refers			0
" this was a terrible crime of violence , " said @entity94 , @entity1 's senior legal analyst			2
" the witnesses have histories of violence			0
so there could be violence threatened against any number of people : participants or even outsiders to the case			2
" in addition to the safety concern , @entity50 said the hearings address " ... some information relating to the reliability of the testimony from a government witness			0
" no one involved in the case is allowed to say who that witness is			0
@entity118 , a convicted felon and former gang member , testified at @entity64 's trial that @entity64 confessed to him in jail that he killed @entity6			1
two women testified that @entity123 attacked them in the same park			0
but it 's not clear whether the testimonies of @entity127 or the two women are in question			0
@entity6 , an intern with the @entity131 @entity130 , disappeared in may 2001			1
her remains were found in @entity0 's @entity134 more than a year later , badly decomposed			2
@entity64 repeatedly denied involvement in her murder , and prosecutors acknowledged a lack of dna evidence linking @entity123 to the crime and a lack of witnesses			0
but in november 2010 , a jury convicted @entity64 of one count of murder with kidnapping and a second count of murder with attempted robbery			0
in february 2011 , he was sentenced to 60 years in prison			0
the @entity6 case generated a swarm of media coverage in 2001 and 2002 , in part because it was revealed that she had had an affair with @entity158 , then a @entity131 congressman from @entity159			1
@entity158 testified at @entity64 's trial and denied involvement in her disappearance and murder and was never charged			2
@entity158 , who served in @entity165 until 2003 , currently serves on the board of directors of the @entity167 , a non-profit group that promotes sustainable farming			0
@entity6 's father , @entity169 , told @entity1 that the family has not been told anything regarding the recent hearings			1
@entity173 said he 's concerned that something will happen with @entity64 's conviction , and " we do n't like that it 's all coming up again			0
" mistrial declared after eyeball pops out @entity1 's @entity180 and @entity181 contributed to this report .			0

several hearings in the case of @entity6 , a @entity0 intern who was killed , have been held
substantive matters are under seal and will remain so , a judge ruled thursday
several media outlets have requested access to the transcripts of those matters
@entity6 's disappearance *captured* media attention because of her affair with a congressman
