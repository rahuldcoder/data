-- tuesday 's midterm elections marked a new milestone for women in @entity5 politics			1
for the first time in the nation 's history , the number of women in @entity8 will reach 100			1
is that cause for celebration ? no , not at all			0
think about that number for a moment			0
having 100 women out of 535 legislators ( 435 representatives , 100 senators ) means that more than 80 % of the country 's federal legislators are still men			1
and we 've seen how well that is working out			0
sure , women made some gains -- bravo			2
but the total female representation will rise by about 1 %			1
again , let 's put away the champagne			1
obviously , the best candidate -- man or woman -- should be the one we choose in each circumstance			0
but the comparatively low number of women with political power in @entity36 should concern us all			2
the embarrassingly small percentage is far lower than in most advanced democracies			0
no one doubts that @entity5 have to fix the dysfunctional @entity5 political system			1
there is reason to believe that electing more women to @entity44 could help repair the problems that have made @entity5 of both parties lose faith in @entity8			1
women usually enter politics because they want to solve a problem , because they see a policy issue they want to address , according to @entity52 , director of the @entity53 at @entity54			2
in general , women run for office to accomplish something			2
men usually run because they want to pursue a political career			2
today , @entity8 is not a place to find solutions , so many women who want to make a difference look elsewhere			1
that 's one of the reasons that we do n't have more women leaders			1
there are also the challenges of raising vast sums of money , which are more easily surmounted by well - connected men			2
women tend to enter politics later , which leaves less time to build power and recruit other women into the field			1
and there 's the fact that incumbents almost always win			0
anything that preserves the status quo tends to preserve the gender imbalance			0
do n't blame voters for the low number of women in @entity8			1
when women do run , they win in similar numbers as men , says @entity52			1
once in office , women tend to function more as consensus builders than men do			1
of course , there are exceptions			0
but women on both sides of the aisle seem better at listening to those with whom they disagree			0
women senators , @entity103 and @entity104 , have been having regular dinner together for years , exchanging views , building bridges			0
there is growing evidence that women are more effective at building bipartisan support for legislation			0
it was @entity114 who led a group of women senators to find a way out of that awful congressional spectacle in 2003 -- the 2003 government shutdown			0
on tuesday night , there were many firsts for women , and each one is a great story			1
the @entity126 will have its first female combat veteran when @entity128 is sworn in , joining a small group of women veterans now serving in the @entity131			2
incredibly , @entity128 is the first woman from @entity133 elected to either chamber			0
let me repeat -- in all the history of the @entity137 , @entity133 -- that epicenter of presidential primary politics -- never , not once , elected a woman to @entity8			2
if @entity128 smashed the stereotype of the combat veteran and broke a dismal statistical record , how about @entity144 , the first black woman ever elected to @entity8 as a member of the @entity104 ? the charismatic 38 - year - old @entity144 has an inspiring @entity5 story			1
she is the child of @entity148 immigrants , who converted to @entity149 and ran for office -- in @entity151 -- as a champion of conservative self - reliance			0
the story of women in @entity5 politics is one of persistent and very - slowly - eroding inequality			1
to break that pattern , more women need to run on both parties			0
each victory is a sign to other women that politics is a field where they can succeed			0
and , as it happens , success for women would give the entire country , @entity103 and @entity170 , a real reason to celebrate .			0

tuesday night marked the first time in @entity5 in which @entity8 has 100 women
@entity176 : put away the champagne ; more than 80 % of @entity8 still men
she says women leaders are are consensus builders and focused on solving problems
@entity185 : if the @entity5 has more female leaders , maybe @entity8 can actually do a good job
