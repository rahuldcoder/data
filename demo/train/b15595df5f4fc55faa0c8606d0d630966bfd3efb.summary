-- it was a mystery that @entity3 's president said his country was struggling to solve			2
what was the massive military equipment hidden under hundreds of thousands of sacks of brown sugar on a @entity10 boat ? where did it come from ? and where was it going before investigators seized the vessel near the @entity17 ? hours after @entity3 said it would ask @entity20 and @entity21 officials for help solving the puzzle , @entity18 gave an answer tuesday night			1
in addition to 10,000 tons of sugar , @entity18 's @entity25 said , the shipment contained " 240 metric tons of obsolete defensive weapons " sent to @entity10 " to be repaired and returned to @entity18			1
" the equipment was manufactured in the mid- 20th century and included two anti-aircraft missile systems , nine missiles in parts and spares , two @entity37 - 21 jets and 15 motors for this type of airplane , the foreign ministry said			1
" the agreements subscribed by @entity18 in this field are supported by the need to maintain our defensive capacity in order to preserve national sovereignty , " the statement said			2
" the @entity18 reiterates its firm and unwavering commitment with peace , disarmament , including nuclear disarmament , and respect for international law			2
" because it is pursuing nuclear weapons , @entity10 is banned by the @entity57 from importing and exporting most weapons			1
the @entity18 government 's revelation , read on state television , is the latest chapter in an international drama that has all the elements of a thriller : a violent confrontation on a detained ship , missiles hidden onboard , a heart attack and an attempted suicide			1
a glance at seizures of @entity10 weapons shipments @entity3 authorities spotted the shipment during an anti-drug inspection late monday			1
few details of the confrontation were available , but the ship 's @entity10 crew of 35 resisted inspection and arrest for days , said @entity3 's security minister , @entity83			1
he described it as " violent , " saying that the crew tried to sabotage the ship by cutting cables on the cranes that would be used to unload cargo			2
as it is , @entity83 said , authorities now have to remove 255,000 sacks of brown sugar by hand			0
during the struggle with @entity3 authorities , the ship 's captain suffered an apparent heart attack and then tried to kill himself , according to president @entity98			1
the crew also refused to raise the ship 's anchor , @entity83 said , forcing @entity3 authorities to cut the anchor loose to move the ship			2
@entity3 's public ministry ordered the crew 's detention , and authorities have since spoken with crew members about their travel plans			2
crew members said they had left @entity18 and headed toward @entity3 , aiming to arrive in @entity10 in 51 days			1
as authorities inspected the vessel , the situation was intriguing enough that @entity98 himself traveled to the ship to take a look -- with reporters in tow			0
is it a missile ? a reporter asked			0
" maybe , " @entity98 said			0
" i am not familiar with that , but it would be good if such things did n't pass through @entity3 , which is a country that loves peace and not war			2
" the president tweeted a photo of what he saw : a green octagon - shaped tube with a cone at its end and a similar - looking piece of equipment behind it			0
late tuesday night , @entity83 said the @entity18 government 's detailed announcement describing the military equipment had caught @entity3 officials by surprise			1
investigators have only combed through one of the ship 's five compartments , he said			0
they are asking the @entity20 and the @entity21 to send teams to help them identify the weapons , and will invite a special commission from the @entity57 to determine whether the shipment violates the organization 's @entity10 weapons ban			1
even with many unanswered questions , @entity83 said , the @entity18 government 's statement explains one thing			2
" now we clearly understand the suicidal attitude of the captain , " he said , " and the rebellion and the rioting of the crew			0
" @entity57 official : ' we are following it closely ' earlier tuesday , a spokeswoman for the @entity57 secretary - general said @entity3 had not officially reported the incident to the @entity57			1
if that happens , a @entity57 panel of experts would review the incident			2
" if it is confirmed that the vessel was carrying arms or related materiel and that the shipment was part of a purchase or sale to or from the @entity10 , then there would indeed be a breach of the @entity57 sanctions regime relating to that country , " spokeswoman @entity168 said			1
members of the @entity57 's @entity10 sanctions committee have seen media reports about the boat and are awaiting a formal notification with details from @entity3			1
" we are following it closely , " said @entity187 , a spokesman for @entity189 ambassador @entity188 , who chairs the committee			0
authorities seized the vessel and the undeclared haul in the @entity3 port of @entity196			2
@entity20 officials say they tracked ship investigators spotted the boat going through the @entity17 to @entity201 and then back toward the canal , according to two senior @entity20 officials who said the @entity20 had been tracking the ship along with the @entity3 for some time			1
a glance at seizures of @entity10 weapons shipments another senior @entity20 official said the @entity20 had been tracking the ship for several days and knew that @entity3 authorities were going to stop it			1
@entity212 spokesman @entity211 declined to describe @entity20 interactions with @entity3 concerning the ship , but noted that the vessel has a checkered past connected with drug smuggling			1
" public reports from 2010 and also a @entity57 panel of experts report from 2012 cite this history , " he said tuesday			0
" so this vessel has a well - known history in this regard			0
" concerns over @entity18 @entity18 state media reported late last month that @entity228 chief of staff gen. @entity227 visited the island and had high - level meetings , including one with @entity18 leader @entity231			0
in the @entity20 , rep. @entity232 , r - @entity233 , described this week 's incident as " serious and alarming " and a " wake - up call " for the @entity237 administration to avoid normalizing @entity20 relations with @entity18			1
some analysts described the situation as a troubling sign that @entity10 could be supplying @entity18 with weapons			1
" this is a country which is just 90 miles away from @entity20 shores , " @entity244 columnist @entity243 told @entity0 's " @entity247 : @entity248			0
" " now , if they can smuggle missile radar into @entity18 , you know , @entity249 knows what else they can put there			2
we do not need a replay of the @entity257 , this time with the @entity10 ' fingers on the triggers instead of the @entity260			0
" @entity243 , author of " @entity261 : @entity10 takes on the world , " said the @entity3 president 's dramatic description of how the ship 's crew members handled the incident did n't surprise him			1
" they do not want anybody on their ships , " he said			0
" whether it 's carrying melons or nuclear technology , the @entity10 would act pretty much the same way			0
" @entity277 inch toward reopening joint complex a history of weapons shipments this is n't the first time @entity10 has been linked to shipping suspected of transporting weapons materials			0
in 2011 , the @entity286 tried -- and failed -- to gain permission to board a ship in the @entity289 suspected of carrying illicit weapons technology to @entity291 , the @entity285 said			0
the @entity293 - flagged @entity292 was believed to have been manned by a @entity10 crew , the @entity285 said			0
under @entity286 surveillance , the vessel eventually turned around and headed to @entity10			0
in 2007 , the @entity285 confirmed that several shipments of suspected weapons technology had left @entity10 destined for @entity299			0
the @entity285 said some of the material was believed to have been high - grade metals that could be used to build missiles or solid - fuel rockets			0
@entity0 reported in 2011 that an unpublished @entity57 report claimed @entity10 was trading banned weapons technology with several countries , including @entity308			1
