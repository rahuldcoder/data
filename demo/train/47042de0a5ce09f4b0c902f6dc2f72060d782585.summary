-- now that @entity1 , the seven - time @entity2 winner , has been thoroughly disgraced , one must ask : has anyone learned anything ? in august , the @entity5 announced that it had disqualified @entity1 for his use of performance - enhancing drugs			1
his @entity2 victories were canceled , and he was banned from further competition in all @entity11 sports			2
the agency announced that it would soon release its " reasoned decision , " which it did on october 10			2
shortly before the anti-doping agency announcement , @entity1 announced that he would not respond to any decision taken			1
he was , he said , putting cycling behind him and moving on with his life promoting the fight against cancer			2
@entity1 resigns from @entity21 cancer charity interestingly enough , however , @entity1 had mounted an aggressive and desperate legal campaign to prevent the arbitration process ( to which he is subject pursuant to cycling rules and the provisions of the @entity27 ) from proceeding			1
his first attempt in the district court in @entity30 was thrown out			2
the judge found that the lengthy document , filled with purple prose , was unacceptable , both as to length , but , more important , content and tone			2
an abbreviated document was then filed			0
the action was defended by the agency			0
the anti-doping agency 's reasoned decision is a well prepared , well written , compelling document			0
its statements and conclusions are supported by documentary evidence , scientific data and sworn affidavits -- more than a thousand pages in all			0
it is a shocking indictment of the conduct of the @entity52 and the riders and officials surrounding it			1
according to the agency report , @entity1 was not only complicit , but a leader who enforced the use of the performance - enhancing drugs			1
the conclusions of the report appear unassailable			0
@entity1 , who had an opportunity to challenge the findings , abandoned the field , in a complete reversal of all his previous conduct			1
news : evidence of @entity1 doping ' overwhelming , ' agency says the @entity71 has until @entity72 to decide whether it will accept the agency 's decision			1
the @entity27 has a further three weeks to intervene , should the cycling union act in a manner which it believes to be incorrect			2
but the cycling union has already compromised itself by declaring in advance that the @entity5 process was unsatisfactory			2
any appeal which it might institute will lead to a far more searching investigation into its own activities than it is likely to relish			0
while we wait for the outcome of that end - game , there are already some lessons to be learned			0
this day of @entity1 's disgrace has been coming for some time			1
it would undoubtedly have come sooner but for the fact that the @entity93 is arguably the most litigious country in the world			0
in order to make its statements regarding @entity1 , the @entity93 anti-doping agency had to be more than certain of its facts			1
that takes time and careful research			0
there had been too much smoke for too long for unbiased observers not to believe that there must be some fire , as well			0
what they perhaps did not expect was the resulting conflagration			0
you can intimidate some of the people all of the time , all of the people some of the time , but not all of the people all of the time			0
some who would have been willing to talk about @entity1 could not afford to defend against actual or threatened lawsuits			1
some needed the jobs they had , which would be at risk or disappear if @entity1 wanted that to happen			1
others were not willing to risk the harassment and abuse that came from crossing him			0
news : @entity1 's legacy may withstand accusations 3			1
the cheating involved was highly organized , well financed and well - coordinated			1
it was not simply a few athletes trying to get an edge by surreptitious use of banned substances			0
instead it was an essential part of the @entity52 team strategy , and it involved participants in several countries , all working to achieve better competitive results by deliberately breaking agreed upon rules at the expense of athletes who competed clean			2
the @entity1 and @entity52 revelations are so well documented that the cycling union officials have an all but insurmountable challenge if they seek to deny them or to try to sweep them under the carpet			1
some of the claims in the report raise questions about whether there was involvement or awareness of the part of the union itself			0
what will the union do about that ? a tougher question yet is whether they can credibly believe that the @entity52 team was the only team in the peloton that used drugs			0
but the real question is how -- how ? -- could the leading cycling officials , those most familiar with the sport and its riders , not have been aware of the nature and extent to which their sport was compromised ? stay tuned			1
this is far from over , and there likely will be even more to be learned from this sordid affair			0
do you own a @entity21 bracelet ? share with us on @entity175 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			1

extent of doping indictment against @entity1 is shocking , says @entity178
@entity1 , who had an opportunity to challenge the findings , gave up , @entity178 says
the cheating involved was highly organized , well financed and well coordinated , he says
pound : how could cycling officials not have known about such *rampant* doping ?
