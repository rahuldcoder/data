-- @entity1 stepped up its battle with the @entity3 over child abuse sunday , with justice minister @entity5 vowing to pass a law requiring priests to report suspicions of child abuse , even if they learn about them in confession			1
the @entity3 regards information learned in confession as completely confidential			0
but under the law proposed by @entity5 , priests could be prosecuted for failing to tell the police about crimes disclosed in the confession box			0
@entity5 said in a statement through a spokesman last week that priests ' failure to report what they learn in confession " has led sexual predators into believing that they have impunity and facilitated pedophiles preying on children and destroying their lives			0
" the minister 's comment to a local radio station sunday comes after the @entity34 rejected @entity1 accusations that church leaders sought to cover up extensive abuse of young people by priests in @entity1			1
saturday 's 25 - page statement is the latest development in a row that has seen an unprecedented rift open up between the @entity34 and @entity1 , a heavily @entity3 country			1
" the @entity34 does not accept that it was somehow indifferent to the plight of those who suffered abuse in @entity1 , " the statement says			1
rather , it says , the @entity34 " devoted considerable attention to the @entity1 situation , " through meetings with @entity1 bishops and directions given by the @entity53 to @entity1 church leaders			0
the @entity34 response says " the accusation that the @entity34 attempted to frustrate an inquiry in a sovereign democratic republic is unfounded			0
" the @entity34 response follows a biting attack by @entity1 prime minister @entity60 in the wake of the @entity63 report , published in july , which investigated abuses in the diocese of @entity63 , near the southern city of @entity67			1
after the publication of the @entity63 report , @entity60 said : " @entity75 should not be stopped by a crozier or a collar , " referring to the hooked staff held by @entity3 bishops during religious services and the collar worn by priests			0
addressing lawmakers , @entity60 claimed the report exposed the @entity34 as trying to hinder an inquiry into child sex abuse for its own benefit and said it revealed the " dysfunction , the disconnection , the elitism that dominate the culture of the @entity34 to this day			1
" @entity1 lawmakers then passed a motion deploring " the @entity34 's intervention which contributed to the undermining of the child protection framework and guidelines of the @entity1 and the @entity93			2
" the @entity34 responded to the criticism by @entity60 and other @entity1 lawmakers by recalling its envoy to @entity1 , archbishop @entity97			2
it said in its statement saturday that many of the criticisms and allegations made against it in the @entity63 report appear to result from an incorrect reading of a 1997 letter to @entity1 bishops from the @entity34 's envoy to @entity1 at the time -- although it acknowledges the letter is open to " misinterpretation " if taken out of context			1
detailing letters and reports issued by the @entity34 , it questions the conclusions drawn by investigators as to the @entity3 's approach to dealing with complaints of abuse by priests			1
the @entity34 also expresses its regret for the abuses committed , acknowledges instances were sometimes mishandled and says it is confident new measures brought in in @entity1 and elsewhere will prevent such " deplorable acts " recurring			0
" in a spirit of humility , the @entity34 , while rejecting unfounded accusations , welcomes all objective and helpful observations and suggestions to combat with determination the appalling crime of sexual abuse of minors , " the statement says			2
the @entity34 response was welcomed by the head of the @entity3 in @entity1 , cardinal @entity137			2
" the reply conveys the profound abhorrence of the @entity34 for the crime of sexual abuse and its sorrow and shame for the terrible sufferings which the victims of abuse and their families have endured within the @entity150 , a place where this should never happen , " he said in an online statement			2
released july 13 , the 421 - page report into the handling of abuses in the diocese of @entity63 demolished claims by the @entity3 in @entity1 that policies it put in place in 1996 had enabled it to get a handle on the problem			1
it also accused bishop @entity164 , who was responsible for policing abuse in his diocese , of not backing the policies himself and failing to take action against abusers			0
the report detailed how complaints against 19 clerics in the diocese were dealt with between 1996 and 2009 by @entity175 authorities			0
journalist @entity176 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 will pass a law forcing priests to reveal abuse disclosed in confession , the justice minister says
the @entity34 says claims it tried to hinder inquiries into abuse by priests are unfounded
its statement rejects criticisms made by @entity1 's prime minister and other lawmakers
