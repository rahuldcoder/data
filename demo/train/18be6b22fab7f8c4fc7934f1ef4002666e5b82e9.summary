-- @entity1 has told @entity0 that his main aim in his fourth and final term as @entity5 president is to restore the battered credibility of world football 's governing body			1
the 75 - year - old was re-elected unopposed as head of the organization on june 1 after the only other candidate , @entity10 chief @entity9 , pulled out of the race before being provisionally suspended by @entity5 over bribery allegations			2
the vote drew widespread criticism as @entity1 received 186 votes from football 's 208 member associations , with critics saying it should not have gone ahead until the investigation into @entity9 and @entity5 vice-president @entity25 -- who was also subject to suspension -- had been completed			1
" i have said ' zero tolerance ' is one thing , but i have also said the social and cultural implementation of football is important -- but now it 's to rebuild the image of @entity5 , that 's number one , and i have already started , " @entity1 told @entity0 in his first sit - down interview since the election			1
never mind @entity36 , the system is to blame " we are now somewhere where football needs a little bit more credibility because we came building up football , bringing so much money in to this game			0
" automatically a lot of devils came in to the game and now we are in a situation where we have to go forward and we have to cut all these allegations , criticism , whatever			2
we ca n't do it in one day , but we will do it			0
" @entity1 -- who described his election win as " the title without glory " and called the ruling body " my @entity5 " -- ruled out blanket life bans for any @entity5 member found guilty of corruption			1
" it 's not a killing instinct that we have to kill people ! zero tolerance means that if you commit something outside the play of field , you will have a punishment , " the @entity65 administrator said			0
" but it can be a yellow card , it can be a red card , it can be a suspension for two games , three games ... lifetime			0
" @entity80 attacks ' corrupt ' @entity5 chiefs despite recent turmoil and opposition to @entity1 in the race for the presidency , the @entity65 insisted that both @entity9 and @entity25 were longtime friends who remain on good terms			1
" we are friends , but friends going together when it is in the interest of some of the people			0
for me , going together with people it 's only for the interest of @entity5 because i have represented @entity5 for 36 years -- it 's my @entity5 , " @entity1 said			1
@entity25 has since backed down , for legal reasons , on threats to release " a football tsunami " by making public his email correspondence with @entity1			2
" this is a question of character			0
if you have a problem inside your family you are not going to disclose if there is anything to be disclosed to the public , " @entity1 said			2
" but i do n't know what he means by the tsunami ! it 's easy to say , it 's like allegations made by ( @entity114 's former 2018 bid leader ) @entity113 -- these are allegations and there is no evidence , so if somebody says it 's a tsunami , you know there are also very little tsunamis			0
" @entity1 commits to ' change ' after winning @entity5 's presidential vote @entity1 said he would not open an investigation into the awarding of the @entity127 to @entity128 -- @entity9 's native country , which has been accused of bribing delegates ahead of last december 's controversial vote -- unless his proposed new " solutions committee " or @entity5 's existing ethics panel recommended such a probe			1
@entity5 's own secretary general @entity135 wrote an email suggesting that @entity128 's financial clout had been behind its success			1
" let me work now on this new approach of the ethics committee , let me work with this committee of solutions			2
and if this committee of solutions or the ethics committee have the impression that they should do something then let them take the decisions , " @entity1 said			2
@entity1 has vowed to bring in a panel of experts to form the solutions committee and help address @entity5 's problems , including 88 - year - old former @entity153 secretary of state @entity154 , @entity157 football legend @entity156 , 64 , and 70 - year - old opera great @entity159			1
" these gentlemen are more or less advisers			0
they are not the experts but advisers , and what they should be also is the kind of council of wisdom -- which my @entity167 would not like because they think they are the council of wisdom , " @entity1 said			0
" @entity159 will be part -- he is happy , he is proud that he is part -- as @entity154 also ! people say he ( @entity154 ) is an old man , but he is a wise man			1
" the solutions committee will be chaired by a @entity5 official , with @entity1 dismissing suggestions that it should be an entirely independent body			1
" the football family has asked me to solve the solution inside @entity5 and not outside @entity5 , " he said			0
" and if we have to go and open our borders and say everyone can come in ... we are a very organized institution with 208 associations , six continents			0
i 've put already zero tolerance in the agenda ! "			0
