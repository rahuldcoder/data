@entity1 , @entity2 on the surface , this riverfront town looks prosperous , peaceful and green ; a trading hub that profits from lucrative gemstone mines located in the hinterland of @entity2 's northern @entity8			1
dig deeper , though , and a dark undercurrent exists -- what community leaders say is a major heroin epidemic			1
even on the campus of @entity14 , used syringes spill out of metal garbage bins marked with signs urging users to properly dispose of drug paraphernalia to avoid the spread of infections like @entity22			0
more needles litter the rocky banks of the @entity25 , near the terminal where boatmen ship fuel , vegetables and the occasional foreign tourist up and down the waterway			0
community leaders offer shockingly high estimates for drug use among young people in this part of @entity2			1
" every family has this drug problem ... i think 65 % or 70 % of young people use drugs , " says reverend @entity39 , the head of the @entity40 , the largest group of churches in the state			1
" the drug is the first enemy of the @entity40 people , " he adds			1
how heroin kills you conflict zone the @entity40 are an ethnic and predominantly @entity52 religious minority in @entity2 , which is a majority @entity53 country			1
for much of the last half century , @entity8 has also been a battleground in a conflict between @entity2 's military and an insurgency led by militants from the @entity60			1
some @entity8 community leaders argue drug abuse now claims more lives than the decades - long conflict , which is estimated to have forced more than 100,000 people to flee their homes in the last three years			1
but this claim is challenged by the top counter narcotics police commander in @entity1			0
in a phone conversation with @entity3 , @entity69 downplays the sight of used heroin syringes on the town 's streets			1
" drug problems are not unique to @entity8 or @entity2 for that matter , " he says , before claiming that government efforts to combat the region 's drug problem have been successful			1
but a recent @entity81 report suggests otherwise			0
the @entity81 ' @entity82 says poppy production in @entity2 more than doubled between 2006 and 2013 , while opium production jumped 26 % from 2012 to 2013			1
@entity2 ranks as the world 's second largest producer of opium after @entity88			1
desperate measures in @entity1 , desperate times call for desperate measures			0
community leaders send out volunteers to clean used needles off the streets , while church groups organize raids against suspected drug dealers , sharing photos and videos of what they say are confiscated narcotics that they subsequently burn			1
in one unusual video filmed and released by the group @entity106 ( or " @entity115 " ) , a pastor wearing a motorcycle helmet preaches through a megaphone at more than a dozen men squatted on a dirt road with syringes bulging from their biceps and hands			0
the pastor , backed up by a man playing guitar , distributes religious pamphlets to the heroin users , one of whom claps listlessly along with a hymn as a needle protrudes from one of his veins			1
community groups have also gotten into the business of addiction treatment			1
at least a half dozen faith - based rehabilitation centers have sprung up in areas around @entity1 in the last two years			0
one of them , the @entity134 , is a compound on the banks of the @entity25 surrounded by 10 - foot high aluminum walls as well as a guard tower			0
the main gate to the compound locks from the outside			0
there is no handle on the inside of the gate			0
" we need to have the walls , " says @entity146 , a pastor leading the team who was treating at least 18 patients at the camp			2
" if they ( the patients ) ca n't see anything around them , it calms them down			0
" for those patients who ca n't control their urges , there are more drastic measures available , including a cage next to the camp 's bamboo chapel			2
" if they commit crimes , if they fight each other , they go in the penalty box , " says @entity146			0
' @entity170 not methadone ' at faith - based rehabilitation camps like @entity134 , counselors do n't administer methadone -- the synthetic opioid often used to treat heroin addicts			1
" we use the words of @entity170 instead of methadone , " explains @entity175 , a recovered heroin addict and former rock star who runs the @entity177 , about a mile up the river from @entity134			2
@entity175 's camp is not walled			2
but patients spend their first week in rehabilitation overcoming drug withdrawal symptoms while locked in a prison - like room that @entity175 called the " prayer room			0
" all 12 of @entity175 's patients are laborers who said they had come from the jade mines of @entity189 , located several hours ' drive northwest of @entity1			2
no @entity191 , 29 , showed the track marks and scars left in his arms and veins after years of heroin abuse			2
" i was hot , i was burning , " he recalls , describing his first agonizing week of heroin withdrawal			2
he and the other patients say heroin and other drugs are bought and sold in the open in an outdoor market near the jade mines			1
" we can get drugs easily everywhere in @entity189 , " @entity206 adds			2
" all of the miners take drugs			2
it 's not strange for us			2
you can buy drugs at the store easily			2
" nding @entity175 shares footage he filmed secretly during a recent visit to one of the heroin bazaars in @entity189			2
the video shows a row of crude shops and stalls that also served as a " shooting gallery , " an area where drug users could inject heroin in the open without fear from law enforcement officers			0
asked why counter narcotics officers do not intervene in @entity189 , @entity69 of the @entity231 for @entity232 in @entity1 blames the @entity40 insurgency			0
" it is difficult to work in places like @entity189 because peace has not been achieved between the government and @entity8 , " he says			1
" so it is hard to implement programs that work toward eliminating drugs in the region			1
" worst yet to come despite state and community - led efforts to battle the drug trade , many community leaders predicted the worst was yet to come in @entity8			1
due in part to high unemployment in the region , reverend @entity39 says many recovering addicts quickly relapse after rehabilitation treatment			1
" we see that the main problem is follow - up and vocational training , " he says			0
" because if they go back home , jobless , it 's very easy to return to the drugs again			1
" the scene at an overgrown cemetery near a camp for families displaced by the conflict underscores the scale of the heroin epidemic			1
hundreds -- if not thousands -- of empty syringe wrappers litter the ground around crypts and tombs that had been nearly swallowed by vegetation			0
used syringes and glass vials lay amid the graves			0
against this macabre backdrop of death and drug abuse , our team encounters a couple of men injecting heroin at sunset			1
surprised by foreign visitors , the men hastily hide their needles			0
one of the men , who identifies himself only as a 30 - year - old farmer , uses leaves from a bush to wipe away blood dripping down his arm as he speaks			0
he says he can buy a dose of heroin for as little as 4,000 kyat , which is roughly equivalent to four @entity300 dollars			0
" if i have more money , i will use more [ heroin ] , " the man says			0
" there are no limits if i have money			0
" after a 10 - minute conversation , both drug users climb onto a motorcycle and ride away along the syringe - strewn path between the tombstones			0
their used needles lie discarded in the grass .			0
