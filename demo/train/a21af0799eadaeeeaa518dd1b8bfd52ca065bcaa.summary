leaders of the @entity2 nations on friday condemned @entity4 actions in and around @entity5 , promising punishments aimed at sending a message to @entity8			1
" we have now agreed that we will move swiftly to impose additional sanctions on @entity4 , " the @entity2 leaders said			1
" given the urgency of securing the opportunity for a successful and peaceful democratic vote next month in @entity5 's presidential elections , we have committed to act urgently to intensify targeted sanctions and measures to increase the costs of @entity4 's actions			1
" the statement from the group -- which includes @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , the @entity26 and the @entity27 -- came hours after @entity27 president @entity28 threatened @entity4 on friday with new sanctions			1
according to a senior @entity28 administration official , each @entity2 country " will determine which targeted sanctions they will impose " -- measures that " will be coordinated and complementary , but not necessarily identical			1
" the @entity27 could take action as early as monday , according to the official			2
this comes as @entity39 nations and @entity5 's government in @entity41 express growing concerns about what they see as @entity4 's role in the @entity46 nation , its military movements outside it and the potential for the situation becoming an even larger conflict that could envelop the region			1
@entity5 prime minister @entity52 accused @entity4 of aiming to occupy his country " militarily and politically , " claiming that @entity4 wants to start a third world war			1
his strong statement came amid a sharp escalation in tensions			0
@entity4 's defense chief ordered new military drills thursday near the border with eastern @entity5 after @entity5 forces said they killed five pro-russian militants in an operation to clear roadblocks near the city of @entity66			1
@entity67 , chief of staff to acting @entity5 president @entity68 , said friday the drills had entered their " second stage , " aimed at encircling @entity66 and cutting off additional supplies or support			1
and on friday afternoon , @entity74 spokesman col. @entity73 said @entity4 aircraft entered @entity5 airspace on several occasions over the previous 24 hours			1
he urged @entity4 " to take immediate steps to de-escalate the situation			0
" a @entity27 official said they were fighter jets			1
they were not major incursions , but rather a handful of flights along the border that crossed into @entity5 airspace , the official said			1
@entity52 said he had asked @entity4 to explain the presence of its troops on @entity5 's border within 48 hours -- but 24 hours later , @entity41 was still waiting for an official response			1
at the same time , he said , the world is lined up with @entity41 in its efforts to restore stability and preserve " the system of world security that @entity4 wants to destroy			0
" just as @entity41 announced the second phase of its so called " anti-terrorism operation , " behind the barricades of the security services building , at the command and control center , the @entity98 forces expressed confidence they can repel any sort of attack			0
" we have 2,000 fighters at the ready and plenty of weapons , " says @entity109 , a former military man turned spokesman for @entity98 militants			0
on friday , @entity5 's @entity115 reported that 13 people on board a bus -- including foreign observers and military officials -- were detained at the entrance to the town of @entity66			1
the ministry said the captors were unknown , but that the detainees were taken to a security office that is under the control of @entity98 separatists			0
the detainees are seven @entity46 representatives from the @entity131 , five @entity5 military representatives and a bus driver , the ministry said			0
" we strongly condemn the fact that the members of the @entity131 and co-operation mission were taken hostage by @entity98 separatist forces , this is completely unacceptable , " @entity5 deputy foreign minister @entity134 told @entity135			0
negotiations were ongoing to secure their release , the ministry reported			0
@entity27 pressure meanwhile , top @entity27 officials have vowed more punitive international actions targeting @entity4 's economy if @entity8 , in their view , continues to escalate the situation			1
the war of words between the @entity27 and @entity4 is growing increasingly intense			2
in a phone call friday , @entity28 and @entity46 leaders agreed that @entity4 has failed to do its part to de-escalate tensions , the @entity153 said			2
the @entity4 have not supported a deal reached last week to decrease tensions , nor have they called on militant groups to put down their weapons , the @entity153 said			0
to the contrary , @entity4 has made things worse through its rhetoric and military exercises , it said			0
at a news conference friday in @entity166 , @entity28 said there will be targeted sanctions that are " ready to go			1
" " i think it 's important for us not to anticipate that the targeted sanctions that we 're applying now necessarily solve the problem , " he said			1
" what we 've been trying to do is continually raise the costs for @entity4 of their actions while still leaving the possibility of them moving in a different direction			0
and we will continue to keep some arrows in our quiver in the event that we see a further deterioration of the situation over the next several days or weeks			0
" @entity28 also praised the unity of other countries in condemning @entity4 " meddling " in @entity5			1
@entity8 argues that the government in @entity41 , which took power after ousted @entity191 president @entity190 fled @entity5 in february , is illegitimate			2
the @entity27 has accused @entity4 of supporting , arming and coordinating the separatist militants -- an allegation @entity8 denies , saying these are simply local " self - defense " units			1
@entity196 and the @entity27 have also voiced concern over an estimated 40,000 @entity4 troops massed near the @entity5 border			1
@entity4 in turn accuses the @entity27 of " running the show " in @entity5 and says it must do more to hold @entity41 to its side of a deal reached in @entity204 , @entity205 , saying the interim government must disband right - wing ultranationalist groups			1
on friday , the @entity208 said chief prosecutor @entity209 had opened a preliminary investigation into alleged crimes committed in @entity5 while @entity190 was in power			0
the investigation will look at the period from november 21 to february 22 , when street protests against @entity190 's government took place that resulted in bloody clashes with security forces			0
volatile situation only a week has passed since foreign ministers for @entity5 , @entity4 , the @entity27 and the @entity221 agreed to the @entity204 deal aimed at easing the crisis			1
but that pact , which called for all sides to refrain from violence and for illegal militia groups to disarm and leave occupied buildings , appears to have faltered , if not failed			0
pro-russian militants remain holed up in government buildings in around a dozen cities in eastern @entity5			2
@entity66 has been at the center of much of the tension			0
nearby in @entity236 , @entity4 's state - run @entity235 news agency reported gunfire at an airfield that @entity5 forces retook from separatist protesters this month			2
but the head of @entity5 's anti-terror operations unit , @entity243 , told @entity135 that a helicopter at the airfield had exploded after a shot hit its fuel tank			0
he said the crew 's commander was injured as a result			0
an explosion was also reported overnight at a police checkpoint in the southwestern city of @entity254			0
economic impact unless and until additional @entity27 sanctions are announced , it 's hard to judge how much they will hurt @entity4			1
previous rounds targeted individual lawmakers and businessmen seen as close to @entity262 as well as a bank , @entity264 , believed to serve the @entity4 president and senior officials			2
the @entity221 has also imposed its own asset freezes and visa bans			0
@entity4 increased interest rates for a second month running friday in an effort to limit the economic damage of rising tensions over @entity5			2
the move came hours after ratings agency @entity276 's cut @entity4 's credit rating to one notch above junk , citing a flight of capital from the country			0
the @entity4 ruble lost more ground friday , taking its losses against the dollar to 8.4 % since the start of the year			0
" we do believe that by more economic pressure , we can stop the aggressor , " said @entity134 , @entity5 deputy foreign minister			0
any further sanctions could hurt the @entity221 as well as @entity4 , since the two have deep trade ties and nearly a third of @entity295 's natural gas comes from @entity8			2
@entity4 prime minister @entity296 acknowledged this week that the sanctions , coupled with other factors , were affecting the economy			2
@entity300 : @entity27 ' running the show ' in @entity41 ' without any scruples ' how will crisis end ? five possible scenarios opinion : why @entity204 accord is tactical victory for @entity4			2
