@entity1 , @entity0 -- the winner of the @entity5 title on sunday will get a first prize less in @entity7 dollars than that of @entity9 's in 2008			1
should @entity10 win the @entity5 his prize will be less in @entity7 dollars than what @entity9 won in 2008 although organizers increased the winner 's prize at @entity19 by € 60,000 this year , recession - driven fluctuations in the @entity15 - @entity7 dollar exchange rate means the men 's and women 's winner 's prizes in @entity7 currency ( $ 1.48 million ) have actually shrunk by almost $ 100,000 compared to last year			1
right across the four @entity26 events -- the @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity5 -- comparative prize pools have been affected by volatile exchange rates , largely caused by the recession			1
the value of this year 's @entity29 tournament has also crashed in @entity7 currency , while the @entity27 -- last year 's poorest @entity26 -- could soon be the richest across the @entity7 , @entity35 and @entity37 currencies			2
the @entity27 offered the smallest winners ' prize check of the four majors in 2008 , however , at today 's exchange rates , the 2009 prize is currently the richest in the game ( although the amount of the 2009 @entity28 winner 's check is yet to be announced )			1
organizers of the 2009 tournament increased the prize to $ 2 million @entity50 dollars -- which is today about u.s. $ 1.55m			2
the value of the tournament in pounds has soared from £ 614,500 to £ 981,200 , and in euros the winner would today receive 1.11 million --- up from 822,600 at the 2008 tournament			0
it is not all bad for the value of the weekend 's @entity5 tournament , either , depending on where you take your money			0
the pound has taken a hammering in the last year , and as a result the @entity5 winner 's prize is now worth £ 135,000 more in @entity35 than it was in 2008			2
should @entity66 's @entity10 manage to win the tournament , he may be wise to take the money to @entity35 and hope the exchange rate improves			0
of course , he would still be 60,000 euros better off in @entity37 , too			0
director of the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) at @entity72 , professor @entity73 , told @entity2 the impact of exchange rates on sports prizes and wages had been largely underestimated			1
" i think there are many subtle influences of the downturn and the exchange rate is one of those			0
" @entity73 said volatile exchange rates are unlikely to cause players to turn away from tournaments like @entity29 as it has a huge prize pool and great history , but , for smaller tournaments it is " a real issue			1
" " with prize money you are trying to attract the best players , and if the prize money pots are reduced ... it really does undermine the appeal of those competitions , " he said .			0

relative value of @entity5 prize is affected by volatile exchange rates
exchange rates have had an impact on the value of all the @entity26
