@entity0 -- @entity3 congressional leaders unveiled a long - awaited $ 940 billion compromise health care plan thursday , setting the stage for a final legislative showdown on president @entity8 's domestic priority			1
@entity10 press secretary @entity9 announced that @entity8 had decided to delay an upcoming trip to @entity12 and @entity13 to help push the bill over the finish line			1
the president had been set to depart @entity0 on sunday , the same day that the @entity17 is likely to vote on the measure			2
watch @entity19 defend health plan maneuver " i 'm sure he wants to be here for the history , " said house speaker @entity22 , @entity23			0
if enacted , the measure would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of @entity31 and @entity32 more than four decades ago			1
it would extend insurance coverage to an additional 32 million @entity35 , according to a preliminary analysis from the nonpartisan @entity37			0
among other things , the plan would expand @entity31 prescription drug coverage , increase federal subsidies to help people buy insurance , and ban denials of coverage for pre-existing conditions			0
it seeks to bridge the gap between previous @entity17 and @entity50 bills partly by watering down and delaying the implementation of a tax on high - end insurance plans			2
as with earlier @entity17 and @entity50 plans , it includes significant reductions in @entity31 spending , in part through changes in payments made under the @entity62 program			2
it also eliminates a deeply unpopular provision in the @entity50 bill that exempts @entity66 from paying increased @entity32 expenses			1
the compromise plan would cut the nation 's deficit by $ 138 billion over the next 10 years , according to the @entity37			1
it would further reduce the deficit by more than $ 1 trillion in the following decade			1
the full @entity17 is now tentatively set to consider two measures sunday : the $ 875 billion plan passed by the @entity50 in december and the compromise , which would bring the total to $ 940 billion			1
the compromise plan can not become law if the @entity50 bill is not also enacted			1
if the @entity50 bill passes , it would go to @entity8 to be signed into law			1
if the revisions unveiled thursday are also approved , they would still have to clear the @entity50			0
@entity17 members unhappy with the less expansive @entity50 bill have received assurances from top @entity86 that they will pass the $ 940 billion compromise			1
@entity17 @entity86 pushed hard to ensure the compromise included an expansion of subsidies to low - and middle - income families , as well as a reduction in the tax on high - end " @entity95 " plans			0
rep. @entity96 , @entity23 , told reporters thursday that the budget office 's cost estimate " will go a long way to get [ fiscally conservative @entity86 ] to feel comfortable with the legislation			0
" the @entity50 bill , if allowed to stand unchanged , would reduce federal deficits by $ 20 billion less than the compromise plan over the next 10 years			1
@entity105 leaders said the new budget office estimate of the revised plan had not changed their opinion of the overall measure , which they vehemently oppose			0
" it 's not too late for the @entity35 people to continue to speak up , " @entity17 minority leader @entity110 , @entity111 , said thursday			0
" they need to yell a little louder , and we can stop this			0
" @entity105 insist the @entity3 proposal will do little to slow spiraling medical costs			0
they also say it would lead to higher premiums and taxes for middle - class families while resulting in deep @entity31 cuts			0
@entity22 has nevertheless expressed confidence in recent weeks that she will have enough support to pass both the @entity50 plan and the compromise bill when they come to the @entity17 floor			2
the speaker needs 216 votes from her 253 - member caucus to pass the measures			0
no republicans are expected to back either one			0
watch @entity22 express her confidence in the plan twenty - seven @entity17 @entity86 indicated to @entity1 on wednesday they will join republicans in opposing the @entity50 plan			2
that leaves opponents of reform 11 votes shy of defeating the measure			0
@entity22 has tried to sweeten the deal for @entity17 liberals by adding a large student loan reform measure to the compromise plan			0
the measure , which is a priority for @entity8 , would end the practice of having private banks offer student loans while expanding direct lending from the government			0
the speaker may also try to help @entity17 @entity86 unhappy with the @entity50 bill by allowing them to avoid a direct vote on the measure			1
she is considering pushing for a vote on a rule that would simply " deem " the @entity50 bill to be passed			1
the @entity17 then would proceed to a separate vote on the changes incorporated in the $ 940 billion version of the plan			2
read about the highlights of the compromise plan republicans failed thursday to force a vote on a resolution requiring the @entity50 health care bill to be brought to an up - or - down vote			1
@entity105 leaders are also fuming over @entity86 ' decision to use a legislative maneuver called reconciliation , which will allow the $ 940 billion plan -- if passed by the @entity17 -- to clear the @entity50 with a simple majority of 51 votes			1
@entity86 lost their filibuster - proof 60 - seat supermajority in january with the election of @entity105 sen. @entity179 of @entity180			2
@entity105 say that reconciliation , which is limited to provisions pertaining to the budget , was never meant to facilitate passage of a sweeping reform measure such as the health care bill			1
@entity86 say that reconciliation was used to pass several major bills in recent years , including president @entity190 's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts			2
public opinion polls indicate that @entity35 remain sharply divided over the @entity86 ' health care reform agenda , though individual elements of it remain widely popular			2
@entity1 's @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 contributed to this report .			0
