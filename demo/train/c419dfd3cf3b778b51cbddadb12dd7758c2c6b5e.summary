-- for those who grew up in the ' 90s , " @entity1 " was definitive pop culture			1
from 1993 - 2000 , the names @entity7 , @entity1 , @entity8 , @entity9 , and @entity10 were synonymous with friday night , and 14 years since mr. @entity10 uttered the words " class dismissed " on the series finale , nostalgia - addicts still miss the @entity15 sitcom			1
now , the @entity16 is hoping to reach a new crop of kids who will feel that same attachment , as the spin - off series " @entity21 " premieres june 27			1
@entity7 and @entity1 are back , but do n't expect the same couple we saw exiting the classroom all those years ago			1
they are surrounded by a new crew of comedic teens , and those behind the new series are hoping they 've created a show that will please fans of the original , but also connect with a younger set looking for a program to call their own			1
@entity0 recently caught up with the cast and creator of " @entity21 " in @entity38 and discovered a whole new world			1
the @entity7 family of the original series has moved from @entity42 to @entity43 in the new series -- which is in line with the series finale			2
on top of a new location , the teens of this modern sitcom are facing a different breed of angst - filled drama , chock full of social media insecurities			1
" we 're dealing with a lot of the same issues that we dealt with on the original series : themes of freedom from your parents and individuality and family support and relying on your friends , " says @entity7 himself , @entity56			2
" but it 's in a lot more complicated framework because the world 's a lot more complicated			2
@entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , internet -- these are issues we did n't have to deal with in the ' 90s , which is shocking , but it was a totally different world			1
" " @entity83 " stars @entity80 as 12 - year - old @entity81 , the older of @entity7 and @entity1 's two kids			1
@entity81 is trying to find her place amid the pressures of family , friends and junior high			0
@entity56 returns as @entity7 , but now it 's his turn to teach lessons			0
he 's moved on from bumbling student to junior high school teacher , leading his own daughter 's class			0
@entity1 is now a full time lawyer and mother , remaining the voice of reason for the @entity7 family -- though @entity101 was nervous about stepping back into the character 's shoes			1
" i did n't know if it was going to be easy because it had been 14 years since i had done it consistently , " @entity101 says			0
" but , literally , the second @entity56 and i were in a room together , i was @entity1 and he was @entity7 and it was like no time had passed at all			1
" still , @entity101 was taken aback when she saw where the pair had ended up			0
" i 'm a little surprised that their oldest child is as old as she is , just because when they left for @entity43 , @entity1 was so focused on becoming a lawyer , " the actress admits			1
" i have a feeling it was @entity7 who was really ready to start a family and that was something they negotiated			0
" @entity56 and @entity101 both confess they did not re-watch the series to get back into character , hoping to craft new versions of the pair we first met as seventh grade students			0
but the show 's younger actors have each taken a crash course on the original series , despite the fact some of them were not born until after it wrapped			1
in fact , the teen stars view their characters as updated versions of the originals			0
@entity80 sees @entity81 as the @entity7 of the new show , while @entity143 , who plays rebellious best friend @entity144 , does n't hide the fact her character is the @entity8			1
@entity81 's crush on new school transfer @entity148 is noticeably similar to the dynamic of @entity7 and @entity1			1
but @entity143 is quick to point out this is n't the same show recycled			2
" a lot has changed since the ' 90s , " she says			0
" technology is insane and the way that people dress , the way that people talk to each other , the way that people do n't talk to each other			0
" @entity164 is the creative mind behind both series , and was n't initially interested in rebooting the brand			0
it was n't until he considered creating a set of characters for a new generation that @entity164 saw the value in a spin - off			2
he is well aware of the high expectations " @entity1 " fans have for the new series , and has taken to heart concerns this could mess up their childhood memories of the show			1
" i do n't want the new show to be compared in its pilot episode to an entire series , " @entity164 says			2
" the worst nightmare i have is that we 've gotten all of this wonderful press and everyone is disappointed			2
i want the old audience to know if you stick with us , you will be extremely well rewarded with the growth of these characters			0
" for now , @entity7 and @entity1 are the only returning characters , but that does n't mean we wo n't see old friends over the course of the season			1
@entity198 ( @entity8 ) and @entity199 ( mr. @entity10 ) will reportedly both make appearances , and the writers promise nods to the old show			0
for @entity101 , there is one aspect of " @entity1 " she hopes stays in the ' 90s -- the fashion			1
" it 's so nice to not have to worry about feathered bangs or chokers or oversized crop tops , " the relieved actress says			0
" we did a flashback scene and i had to wear lace and a choker , the crimped hair and the bangs			0
i 'm like , ' oh my gosh ! i 'm so glad i do n't look like this anymore			0
' " @entity164 is certain the relatable characters of the original series are what stood out for fans , and believes he and the writers have struck gold a second time around			2
" the fact that the lead of the show was not 6 - feet , sandy - haired , blue - eyed			2
the lead of the show was us ! we want to do it real			0
i want a stumbling , gawky , unsure of herself child to grow up in front of us again			0
we did it once and we were successful			0

" @entity1 " spinoff " @entity21 " makes its long - awaited debut
show creator says fans of the ' 90s original wo n't be disappointed
but , they are *confident* they 've made the show modern and *relevant* for today 's kids
