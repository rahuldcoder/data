@entity1 prime minister @entity0 has been crystal clear about the goals of @entity4			1
destroy @entity6 ' tunnels , end its rocket - fire ( and that of @entity9 ) , and bring about " sustainable quiet " for the people of @entity1 by demilitarizing @entity10			1
those aims were restated by @entity0 's spokesman , @entity14 , as the latest ceasefire came into force tuesday			0
" we do n't want to see that terrorist military machine rebuilt , " he told @entity17			1
" we have to make sure that @entity10 stays demilitarized			0
" after nearly a month of combat , the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) say they have destroyed 32 " offensive " tunnels			0
@entity6 ' stocks of rockets have been depleted ( by about two - thirds ) , its launch facilities hit hard , the @entity20 says			1
but how do you define " demilitarized ? " @entity6 ' short - range mortars killed more @entity1 than its rockets -- does @entity1 insist on those being surrendered ? how would they even be found ? and by whom ? sustainable quiet will depend on factors @entity1 can influence , but not control : above all its willingness to offer the 1.8 million people of @entity10 a future that is something better than an open prison			1
it 's estimated around two - thirds of @entity39 have never left the @entity10 ; @entity41 writer @entity40 speaks of a desperate fatalism after nearly a decade of conflict			1
" we , who were attacked from the sky , from the sea , from the fields , who had one - ton bombs dropped on our heads in pointless rounds of killing , have turned our back on life , " he wrote in @entity44 this week			0
can they turn again -- and glimpse a future in which they can sell their produce in foreign markets and travel freely , in which they can find work , build homes and see their children receive an education without the overhanging fear of the next bombardment ? such a possibility was envisaged in the agreement that ended the last conflict in 2012 and provided for " opening the crossings and facilitating the movements of people and transfer of goods , and refraining from restricting residents ' free movements and targeting residents in border areas			0
" but the agreement was not implemented			0
" @entity1 had committed to holding indirect negotiations with @entity6 over the implementation of the ceasefire but repeatedly delayed them , " partly because of domestic political considerations , writes @entity82 , a senior analyst with the @entity83 , in the @entity84			1
@entity1 officials and analysts have cited elections and coalition - building as delaying any meaningful engagement , even though 2013 saw fewer rocket attacks than any year since 2006			1
will it be different this time ? the destruction of entire @entity10 neighborhoods ( @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 to name but three ) and the displacement of more than 500,000 people according to @entity105 estimates tuesday -- will demand a huge reconstruction program			0
@entity0 says @entity1 is " demanding that the rehabilitation of @entity10 be linked to its demilitarization			2
" on the contrary , says @entity117 , the @entity118 's envoy in the @entity119 : " what they should offer is an end to the blockade , an end to the occupation , before they can even ask the @entity41 to consider the idea of being demilitarized			2
" retired brigadier - general @entity120 , director - general of @entity1 's @entity121 , says this linkage or sequencing is the $ 64,000 question			1
" the old ideas did n't work , " he said			0
" we need new ones			0
we have to make sure the international community takes steps so that cement coming into @entity10 is used for civilian projects			0
" @entity120 said a " totally different structure of supervision should be in place " before @entity1 can allow what might be called dual - use materials into @entity10			1
that structure would include , according to @entity1 officials , a @entity140 police force at the @entity142 crossing into @entity143			2
the @entity144 has offered to reactivate its @entity145 , which operated at the @entity142 crossing between 2005 and 2007 , as a second layer of supervision at all crossings			0
@entity150 , or tactics ? will @entity6 , chastened by a devastating onslaught that has left hundreds of its fighters dead or captured , and which has seen the tunnels in which it invested so heavily blown up and bulldozed , simply start over -- preparing for the next round ? or will it see a new reality amid the dust and rubble ? few observers expect @entity6 to give up the language of defiance			1
it can derive some satisfaction from the level of resistance its fighters offered , especially in close - quarters fighting in places like @entity169			0
the predictions of some @entity1 officials that @entity6 fighters would melt away once the going got tough were confounded			1
veteran defense writer @entity174 says in @entity44 : " @entity6 was not defeated ; the organization will remain in power in @entity10 and [ will be ] the key partner in any future agreement			1
" but the movement is beleaguered			0
its leadership has gone underground , literally and metaphorically , to avoid assassination by @entity20 air - strikes			0
it faces a severe financial crisis , unable to pay the salaries of government employees			0
it 's been abandoned by former patrons @entity190 and @entity191 , and is caught in the growing @entity194 - @entity193 divide across the @entity196 world			2
its chief financier , @entity199 , which has stepped in to pay $ 20 million a month in wages to @entity10 workers , is under pressure from other @entity203 to scale back support for @entity6			2
above all president @entity205 of @entity143 has strangled @entity6 economically and militarily			2
soon after the overthrow of president @entity207 a year ago , @entity205 -- then military chief -- moved to close the smuggling tunnels under the @entity143 - @entity10 border , depriving @entity6 of much - needed revenue and its only way to import weapons			1
@entity6 may also face growing dissent within @entity10 , or at least less support , as people weigh up the cost , in human and financial terms , of the latest conflict			2
in @entity169 tuesday , @entity219 surveyed the ruins of his house			0
" i am a wedding photographer			0
i have nothing to do with this war , " he told @entity17			2
" maybe if we had got some concessions it would be worth it , but we got nothing			0
" it appears to be a growing sentiment , and one that @entity120 thinks will help change @entity6 ' calculations			2
" it has made a strategic decision , " he says , " to give up part of its terrorist identity in order to keep control over @entity10			0
" @entity0 's options for now , @entity0 can negotiate from a position of strength			0
he , his defense minister and the @entity1 chief of staff have enjoyed better than 80 % approval ratings for much of the campaign , despite the deaths of more than 60 @entity1 soldiers -- a far higher toll than during the fully - fledged invasion of @entity10 in 2008 - 09			1
" there is trust from the @entity1 public that this triumvirate know exactly what they are doing , " said @entity251 of the @entity252			2
" they feel they have a leadership that is controlled and moderate in defending them and doing what needs to be done on the military and political level			0
" even the opposition @entity266 has praised the conduct of the campaign			0
" they operate very carefully , proportionately			0
i think they defend @entity1 through their decisions , " @entity270 member @entity269 told @entity17			1
if anything , it is the right - wing that challenges @entity0 -- with some in the coalition government saying the campaign in @entity10 has not gone far enough and that @entity6 should be crushed			1
@entity0 has warned cabinet ministers pushing for a more aggressive approach to fall into line			0
he appears to accept that @entity6 can not be eradicated , certainly not without a full occupation of @entity10 that would be a quagmire and entail international condemnation			2
some @entity1 officials believe @entity6 actually serves a purpose -- preventing fundamentalist groups like @entity9 from taking over @entity10			1
they are also happy to see the @entity41 in two camps : @entity6 and the @entity140 rather than united under one flag			2
an end to the two - state solution ? @entity0 is now the second - longest serving prime minister in @entity1 's history , to some observers his longevity is down to his innate caution , his refusal to make compromises that might down the road put @entity1 's security at risk			1
as the latest conflict in @entity10 erupted , he said that had @entity1 given up security control of the @entity302 , it would be inviting disaster			2
" if we were to pull out of @entity305 and @entity306 , like they tell us to , there 'd be a possibility of thousands of tunnels " expanding on the theme , @entity0 added : " there can not be a situation under any agreement in which we relinquish security control of the territory west of the @entity317			0
" to many observers in @entity1 that was shorthand for " there will be no @entity41 state			1
" the prospect of a wider peace deal seems as far away as ever , even if its essential components are the same as they were 20 years ago -- a two - state solution , co-existence between @entity1 and the @entity302 with mutually agreed territorial swaps , and the removal of most @entity329 settlements from the @entity302			1
senior @entity1 officials look at the turmoil around them , from @entity332 and @entity191 to @entity333 , and ask whether settling the @entity41 issue is still the most pressing of the day			2
@entity196 governments are preoccupied with survival , not @entity41 liberation			0
@entity120 at @entity1 's @entity121 says the real threat to the region is @entity341 radicalism ; and that has brought together @entity1 and moderate @entity196 states such as @entity143 and @entity317 ( and by extension @entity344			1
) to many observers , an agreement between @entity347 and @entity6 signed on april 23 this year provides the best -- perhaps the only -- hope of breaking the cycle of violence			1
in it , @entity6 agreed to a " consensus government " of @entity41 that pledged non-violence , the recognition of @entity1 , and adherence to past agreements , a government that would restore the influence of the @entity140 in @entity10			1
" tragically , @entity1 rejected this opportunity for peace and has succeeded in preventing the new government 's deployment in @entity10 , " say former @entity119 president @entity360 and @entity361 , a former @entity362 , in " foreign policy			1
" if this government is now allowed to take root in @entity10 , to take responsibility for its reconstruction and allow for an internationally - agreed and verifiable program of demilitarization , perhaps the future can be different			0
but as @entity82 of the @entity83 concludes : " this solution would of course have been available to @entity1 , the @entity119 , @entity143 and the @entity140 in the weeks and months before the war began , before so many lives were shattered			1

@entity1 has been clear that the aim of @entity4 was to demilitarize @entity6
but @entity17 's @entity382 says , to secure peace , @entity1 needs to offer @entity39 a better future
he says many observers believe a @entity347 - @entity6 deal in april was the best chance for peace
@entity1 rejected that , he says , and while it could be implemented still , lives have been lost
