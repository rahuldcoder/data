when you click " like " on your friends ' @entity2 posts , do you really mean it ? if seeing your @entity2 friends living wonderful , fun - filled lives gives you a case of the blues , you 're not alone			1
a new @entity10 study found that the more people checked @entity2 , the more likely they were to feel worse about their own lives			1
to measure people 's feelings and @entity2 usage , the team enlisted a small group of young adult @entity2 users in @entity19 and texted them five times a day for two weeks			2
each text linked to an online survey that asked how they were feeling			0
in addition to reporting how much they were checking @entity2 , the subjects rated their worry and loneliness levels at that moment as well as their overall satisfaction with life			0
the authors also asked people to rate their level of life satisfaction at the start and end of the study , and found that the more participants used @entity2 over the two - week study period , the more their life satisfaction levels declined			1
by contrast , the study found that face - to - face interactions with others led people to feel better over time			0
" over a billion people belong to @entity2 , and over half of them log in every day , " said @entity10 social psychologist @entity45 , lead author of the study			1
" on the surface , @entity2 provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling the basic human need for social connection			0
but rather than enhancing well - being , our findings demonstrate that interacting with @entity2 may have the opposite result for young adults			1
" what is it about the social network that bums some people out ? one theory is that people are comparing themselves to their friends ' seemingly fantastic digital lives and feeling inferior			2
though the sample group of 82 people was small , the findings are similar to other studies about @entity2 use and mental health			2
@entity2 has become a tempting subject for researchers because of its role as a constant presence in so many people 's lives			1
psychologists , sociologists and other academics are curious about what kind of impact it has on its users ' brains , emotions and self - worth			0
some researchers have tapped directly into the gold mine of data generated by the social network ( @entity2 has its own staff of data scientists and sometimes teams up with universities ) , while others conduct their own independent studies			0
in early 2012 , a study out of @entity97 also found that many people had a case of the blues after checking @entity2			2
the researchers talked to a group of 425 students and found correlations between the amount of time people spent checking @entity2 and negative feelings about their own lives			1
the more time their subjects spent on the social network , the higher probability that they would think their friends lived better , happier lives			0
in january , a study from @entity113 found that a third of people felt worse after spending time on @entity2			1
seeing updates of friends ' successful careers , cute babies and fabulous vacations inspired feelings of envy , loneliness and even anger .			0
