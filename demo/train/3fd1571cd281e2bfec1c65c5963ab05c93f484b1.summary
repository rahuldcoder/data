" you never want to get scored on , but it was good for us , " said @entity1 midfielder @entity75 , who thought the @entity38 picked up their play immediately after the goal			1
@entity22 scored a sweet goal after @entity5 cleared a @entity1 corner			1
the @entity84 - born player took a couple of touches that unleashed a wicked bending shot that left @entity5 goalkeeper @entity88 standing helplessly still in the 64th minute			2
@entity23 scored in the 81st minute when midfielder @entity89 sent a ball toward goal that the @entity1 star redirected into the net			1
@entity5 , the fourth - ranked team in the world and one of the pre-tournament favorites in @entity97 , outshot the @entity38 20 to 15			2
but @entity72 had four saves , including one that kept the @entity1 from going down two goals			2
after a @entity67 shot ricocheted off the post , @entity72 swept away a rebound from @entity105 while reaching over his left shoulder			0
" i do n't think @entity5 broke us down			2
i think we in a way let ourselves down , " said @entity72 , who was named man of the match			0
" so that 's kind of a good sign because had we gotten torn apart , it would have been a lot tougher			0
" lineup changes the @entity117 team was missing defender @entity118 through a red card suspension and striker @entity120 and defender @entity121 , who were injured			0

after the match , he said he made it through sunday 's contest without problems			0
the @entity1 was missing striker @entity131 , who has a strained left hamstring			2

the game was played in the heat and humidity of the @entity141 rainforest			0

the referee even allowed a short water break in the first half , a first in a @entity10 match			0
the second half was played at a much more measured pace until after the @entity1 goals , when @entity5 attacked with more intensity , searching for the score that would keep it from being eliminated from the tournament			1
the @entity38 , 13th in the @entity161 rankings , were cheered on by about 20,000 red , white and blue fans at @entity163			0
