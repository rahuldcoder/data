-- @entity5 death row inmate @entity4 's rare birth defect will make his execution , slated for just after midnight wednesday , an " excruciating " process , his lawyer says			1
and she hopes to prove it by videotaping her client 's death , a motion a federal court has denied			1
in what would be the first execution since @entity16 's botched procedure last month , @entity4 is schedule to die at 1:01 a.m. et at @entity18 in @entity19			1
in their request for a stay , filed tuesday with the @entity23 , @entity4 's attorneys say he could suffer a " prolonged and excruciating execution " because of his birth defect , known as cavernous hemangioma			1
a @entity29 @entity28 judge on monday declined to stay the execution , along with the request that the procedure be videotaped			1
" if @entity5 officials are confident enough to execute @entity4 , they should be confident enough to videotape it			1
it is time to raise the curtain on lethal injections , " said defense attorney @entity37			2
@entity4 , who turned 46 last week , is already in pain , as his condition includes unstable tumors in his head and neck , causing him to bleed regularly from his mouth , nose , eyes and ears , @entity37 said			2
dr. @entity50 of @entity51 filed an affidavit in the case saying that @entity4 's airway is so " severely compromised and obstructed , " especially when he 's lying flat , that it could easily be ruptured , raising the risk that @entity4 could choke or suffocate			2
" if you touch it , it bleeds , " @entity50 wrote of @entity4 's airway			2
in 1997 , a jury convicted @entity4 of first degree murder , kidnapping , and first degree burglary and recommended the death sentence , court documents show			1
he was accused of fatally shooting his ex-girlfriend 's presumed new boyfriend , @entity65 , and firing at @entity65 ' son , 6 , before kidnapping @entity68			0
after raping his ex-girlfriend , he became involved in a gunfight with authorities , during which @entity4 and a @entity5 state trooper were injured , according to court documents			1
controversy over lethal injections has been brewing in recent years after @entity77 manufacturers -- including the @entity79 - based manufacturer of pentobarbital -- banned @entity29 prisons from using their drugs in executions			0
in 2009 , the @entity29 - based manufacturer of sodium thiopental , a drug also commonly used in executions , stopped making the painkiller			0
many states have scrambled to find substitutes from overseas or have used @entity29 - based compounding pharmacies to create substitutes			0
attorneys for death row inmates in several states have flooded the court system , arguing correctional facilities ' secrecy over where and how they obtain drugs is unconstitutional and violates the @entity103 's " cruel and unusual " punishment clause			0
last month , @entity16 used a new three - drug lethal injection protocol to execute convicted murderer and rapist @entity107 , but his vein collapsed and he died of an apparent heart attack			1
a full investigation and autopsy results are still pending , but witnesses said they saw @entity107 struggling to speak as he convulsed and writhed on the gurney			0
previously , @entity16 inmate @entity114 said during his january execution , " i feel my whole body burning			0
" @entity114 was executed using a cocktail that included pentobarbital , as was @entity120 ' @entity119 , who also complained of a burning sensation during his april execution			2
also in @entity120 , @entity124 's attorneys challenged the state 's plan to administer pentobarbital to their client			0
a federal court stayed his execution last week -- not because of the drugs @entity120 planned to use , but because his defense team deserved more time to make the case that @entity124 was intellectually disabled			0
on monday , the @entity135 @entity134 weighed in on the issue , reversing a stay of execution for inmate @entity139 after his attorneys argued last year that a statute keeping the compounders of lethal injection drugs " a confidential state secret " was unconstitutional			1
" we hold that it is not , " justice @entity145 wrote in the 33 - page majority opinion			0
he said the reason for keeping such information private is " obvious , including avoiding the risk of harassment or some other form of retaliation from persons related to the prisoners or from others in the community who might disapprove of the execution as well as simply offering those willing to participate whatever comfort or peace of mind that anonymity might offer			0
