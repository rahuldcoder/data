@entity0 , @entity1 -- for more than a decade , @entity3 felt helpless as her older brother lived on the streets , eating out of garbage cans			1
she tried repeatedly to get him help for his mental illness , but authorities told her there was nothing they could do			0
after he was arrested in 2008 for damaging someone 's car during a schizophrenic outburst , she was finally able to become his legal guardian and get him into a halfway house with psychiatric services			0
but as she watched his mental health improve , she noticed his physical health getting worse			0
" i learned that he was becoming borderline diabetic , " she said			0
" he was n't like that even when he was homeless			0
" she investigated and found out that the nonprofit facility was mainly feeding him packaged and canned foods because it could n't afford fresh fruits and vegetables			1
" i had a small garden , so i thought , ' well , i 'll just put in some extra rows , ' " @entity3 said			1
" i began making weekly deliveries of whatever was coming up			0
" she soon realized , however , that the problem extended well beyond her brother 's transitional home			0
while farmers markets were springing up across the city , she noticed that low - income and working - class neighborhoods had few grocery stores or places to buy fresh produce			1
" if you do n't live in an affluent part of the city ... your easiest options are the dollar menu or the convenience store attached to a gas station , " said @entity3 , 45			1
for residents who lacked transportation , buying healthy food was even more difficult			1
" it might be a trek , or they might have to borrow a car or get on a bus , " @entity3 said			1
" often , once they get there , they are paying a very high price for the food			2
" a recent study from the @entity67 at @entity0 confirmed her impressions			1
it showed that more than 72,000 low - income city residents , many of them minorities , lived in " food deserts " -- areas without a supermarket with fresh food nearby			1
they also faced a greater risk of cardiovascular disease and premature death			0
access to fresh food is an issue for many communities throughout the @entity81			1
according to the @entity83 , nearly 10 % of the @entity81 population lives in low - income areas more than a mile from a supermarket			1
discovering this problem sparked something inside @entity3 , who had recently left her corporate job to find more meaningful work			1
" i really thought it was an injustice			0
... healthy food is a basic human right , " she said			1
" i decided to rip up my whole backyard and make it all a garden , and it just kind of snowballed from there			0
" today , @entity3 has 200 volunteers helping her tend 9 acres of crops on three sites			1
since 2008 , she says , her nonprofit , @entity101 , has grown more than 26,000 pounds of fresh produce for underserved communities in @entity0			1
at first , @entity3 donated her locally grown , chemical - free fruits and vegetables to churches and food pantries			1
but she soon started selling them herself in the neighborhoods that need them the most , for what she estimates is about half the price of organic produce sold in stores			0
with her 1,000 - kilowatt smile and boundless energy , some might call @entity3 a goodwill ambassador for healthy eating			1
she 'd claim that her produce -- from cucumbers and okra to watermelon and blueberries -- can sell itself , but her enthusiasm certainly does n't hurt			0
" everyone 's been excited about the string beans , " she says to one customer			0
" how are you going make yours ? " she strives to make her food as affordable as possible			2
people are also able to use their food stamps to purchase anything she sells , including seeds and seedlings so they can grow the food themselves			1
emmons and her volunteers distribute recipe cards , too , and urge customers to attend the group 's free cooking demonstrations and canning classes			0
it 's all part of their mission to help people take control over what they are eating and improve their health			2
and customers seem hungry for all that @entity3 and her group are offering			1
" we 've been really , really thrilled about the response from the community , " @entity3 said			1
" even as early as january of this year , they were calling , asking , ' when are you coming back out ? ' " @entity155 says she was a junk - food junkie for much of her life , until she was diagnosed with diabetes six months ago			2
she immediately vowed to make eating healthy a priority for herself and her 11 - year - old daughter			2
but because she is unemployed , waiting for her disability to come through , it has n't always been easy			2
" we try to eat the best we can , but we often have to cut corners , " said @entity155 , 38			0
" sometimes , that means picking the $ 1.49 mac and cheese over $ 5 worth of vegetables			2
" since @entity155 discovered @entity3 ' produce stand this summer , she has visited nearly every time it 's been open			2
" i could n't believe all the beautiful , fresh vegetables , and the price that she was charging was phenomenal , " @entity155 said			2
" it 's making me and my family healthier			0
" keeping this enterprise going is a labor of love for @entity3 , who spent years doing it for free before recently taking a small salary			2
but she said the work has reconnected her to ideals and interests she 's had her entire life			0
@entity3 did n't have a lot of money growing up in @entity189 , but her parents often drove 30 miles to make sure the family had fruits and vegetables			1
that commitment to healthy eating carried over to adulthood , when she started gardening in @entity0			1
" there was lots of trial and error , " she said			0
" but i was fascinated with the miracle of watching seed drop into the ground and see it flower and grow fruit			0
" @entity207 also has become a certified beekeeper , so local honey is now available at her stand			0
and her new @entity212 initiative -- @entity212 -- delivers boxes of fresh produce to families every week			2
she has attracted local support for her nonprofit , including a local farmer who taught her to drive a tractor and lets her grow food on his land			0
in august , she opened a permanent farm stand on land donated by @entity1 - based corporation @entity224 , and she plans to open an educational center there where she can hold classes and events that promote a healthy lifestyle			1
eventually , @entity3 would love to expand her organization across the country , combating food deserts wherever they exist			1
for now , she 's devoted to helping @entity0 residents			2
" when i see people coming to the farm stand ... i feel encouraged , " she said			0
" i feel like i am giving them a gift -- a healthier , longer , better , more delicious life			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity240 website and see how to help .			0

many low - income americans lack easy access to fresh , healthy food
study : more than 72,000 people in @entity0 , @entity1 , live in such a " food desert "
to help them , @entity3 has grown more than 26,000 pounds of fruits and vegetables
