-- @entity2 's initial brush with swimming as a seven - year - old in @entity4 could never have foretold her success in the pool			1
" i remember in my first session i jumped into the deep end and nearly drowned , " @entity2 told @entity0 's human to @entity8			1
" my coach kind of saved me			2
" one can safely say that she has gotten much , much better			0
only eight years after that frightening experience , @entity2 became her country 's maiden @entity15 gold medalist in swimming by upsetting the reigning world champion in the 100 - meter breaststroke at @entity20			1
however , her path to success and " rock star " status in @entity4 , as her coach put it , has n't been an easy one			1
still not officially classified as an adult , she has had to deal with the death of her mother , who was hit by a car when @entity2 was four and barely out of diapers			1
she was also forced to adapt to a new country when she left @entity4 for @entity33 in 2009 , a life - altering move instigated by her father who thought his daughter 's prospects in both swimming and academics would improve			1
meilutyte trains in @entity43 , southwest @entity33 , and goes to the same school attended by @entity45 , a bronze medalist in diving for @entity48 in 2012			1
her coach @entity49 calls her a " great scholar			0
" in @entity4 , the pool is " not great , " @entity2 said			1
" we do n't have a good training facility			0
also it 's really hard to combine school with swimming			1
you either do one or the other			0
" we just decided to go to @entity33 because it would be a great time to balance school and swimming at the same time as college			1
yes @entity4 and @entity33 are really a bit different , the people are different , but i got used to it really fast			1
" it 's indeed apparent that @entity2 , a bubbly blonde , is a quick learner			1
although she says the breaststroke was " natural " for her , it was n't her original specialty			0
" i did it once for a laugh , because i was a freestyler , and it went really well , " @entity2 said			1
" so i kept competing in it and training until i got better and better			0
" it 's quite a tough stroke but i really like it			2
it 's like a frog stroke			2
" she used to " mess about " in training and only took swimming seriously when she broke a national record in her age group			2
that 's when something clicked			2
she liked the feeling winning brought , and pushed herself further			0
still , not many , including @entity2 herself , expected her to claim gold at the @entity15			1
in a sport where half a second is a sizable progression , @entity2 shaved about two seconds off her personal best in @entity91 , raising her level when it mattered most			1
in the final , @entity2 edged @entity95 2011 world champion @entity94 -- someone she looked up to as a role model -- by 0.08 seconds			1
@entity98 's @entity97 , one of the leading swimmers of her generation , was in the final , too			2
" it was all really surreal for quite a while , " @entity2 said			1
" it takes a while to sink in because my mind was n't preparing for anything like that			0
i never told myself i would win a medal			0
" @entity94 would later win gold in the 200m breaststroke in @entity91 to successfully defend her 2008 @entity15 title from @entity113			1
" i always looked up to her , " @entity2 said			1
" being there with all the best swimmers of the world is something i always dreamed of			0
" now @entity2 , at 16 , is a role model			2
@entity49 said a breakout performance from @entity2 had been " brewing for a while " and that there was nothing sinister behind her incredible improvement -- @entity124 teen @entity123 had to rebut accusations of possible drug use after her own world - record performances at @entity20			1
" we did n't realistically know what she would do , " @entity49 said in july , following @entity2 's victory			1
" her breaststroke was pretty tidy and we tidied it up even more			0
" she is a talented and vigilant worker			0
when you 've got talent and work ethic , you 've got a great kid			0
" along with putting in the hours , @entity2 is a fierce competitor			2
for her , finishing second is n't good enough			0
" i think i am really competitive in everything , " she said			0
" i love racing , i love winning , i hate losing			0
i think that 's one of the properties i 've got and one of the things that push me in training			2
" i 've got goals i want to achieve			0
" as hard of a worker as @entity2 is , she does admit that it 's not easy leaving her warm bed for a cold pool in @entity43 to begin her day			1
the usual starting time for training is 5:30 a.m. , when most of her fellow students are sleeping			0
she usually trains 30 hours per week overall -- the toughest parts are the extended non-stop cardio sessions -- but must fulfill her commitments as a fulltime student			0
sometimes she struggles to stay awake in the classroom			0
it 's no surprise that @entity2 does n't have much time to hang around with friends			1
" you do n't have much time to socialize , " she said			0
" i have to train early so i ca n't stay up late , so obviously the social life gets affected a bit			0
but i do n't mind			0
" you get into a routine with it			0
it all becomes a bit easier			0
there is an outcome at the end of this			0
" as for fast food and the like , it 's off limits			2
" i do n't count my calories , " @entity2 added			2
" i have to eat a lot , healthy food , not cakes , although i do like chocolate and cakes a lot			0
" @entity2 's next major meet is next month 's world championships in @entity191 , where she has a busy program competing in the 50m and 100m breaststroke , plus the 50m and 100m freestyle			1
and yes , @entity2 will continue to represent @entity4 , the former @entity194 -- though she is sometimes asked if she wants to switch nationalities after spending four years in @entity48			1
" some of my teammates from @entity4 also do n't train in @entity4 , " she said			2
" it does n't really matter where you train -- as long as you go to competition and you have the @entity4 t - shirt on , you are representing your country			1
" that 's what i train for , to represent my country , and i want the world to know about it			2
" the world has gotten to know @entity2 , and there could be more to come .			2

@entity2 says getting out of bed is difficult but she does it because she loves swimming
as a 15 - year - old in 2012 , @entity2 became @entity4 's first @entity15 gold medalist in the pool
several years after the death of her mother , @entity2 moved to @entity33 to better her prospects
@entity2 says she *visualizes* her races from start to finish before major swimming meets
