pretty much everything has changed in @entity3 - @entity2 relations since @entity4 and premier @entity5 signed the @entity6 40 years ago on february 21 , 1972			1
@entity4 's goals were purely geostrategic			1
by cultivating @entity2 , he sought most of all to put pressure on @entity9 to come to terms to achieve his promised " peace with honor " there , hopefully before the november election			2
he also sought , through @entity2 , to pressure @entity13 to embrace détente and thus put @entity3 in the catbird seat in relations with the two communist behemoths			2
@entity2 had different priorities -- most of all , @entity19 wanted to stiffen president @entity4 's spine to oppose @entity22 aggression and therefore to reduce @entity13 's threat to @entity2			1
in the 1980s , @entity19 got its way with @entity25 , who came into office as an @entity28 crusader			0
indeed , president @entity25 aligned @entity3 strategic interests with @entity2 so closely that @entity3 began military sales to @entity19			1
but in 1989 everything changed			0
president @entity32 , just inaugurated and planning to move @entity3 - @entity2 relations to a new level , saw this goal cut short by the brutal suppression of demonstrators at @entity39 on june 4 , 1989			1
as @entity2 transitioned from being @entity3 's darling reforming communist country to being its poster child for communist repression , the @entity40 ( and soon afterward , the @entity22 itself ) unraveled			1
not only did the @entity22 collapse rob @entity3 - @entity2 relations of their underlying strategic rationale , @entity51 repression in @entity2 introduced human rights as a major political factor in the relationship			1
every @entity3 human rights organization expended much effort in the 1990s to attach @entity2 somehow to that agenda and thus increase its own visibility and emotional power			2
this made it far more difficult to deal with @entity19 , especially as the @entity2 connected this human rights agenda directly to an @entity3 objective to bring down the @entity65 's rule			1
the result was deep mutual distrust			0
@entity68 in 1992 set the country again on a course of reform to generate rapid growth , which he viewed as critical to maintain the party 's rule			0
@entity75 now moved to the center of @entity3 - @entity2 relations			1
where in the 1970s the @entity4 administration could ignore @entity2 's horrendous human rights abuses under @entity81 to achieve @entity3 geopolitical ends , starting in the 1990s , @entity3 pursued economic gains in @entity2 in part with the hope that these would also lay the foundation for democratic evolution there			1
this took place in the context of overwhelming @entity3 economic and technological superiority , further enhanced by the information revolution that @entity3 also led			2
this history highlights a core reality : the @entity3 - @entity2 relationship has never sustained one rationale or focus for very long			1
it has periodically adapted to major developments in the international environment and in domestic politics			0
none of those changes has come easily			0
each sowed apprehension , distrust and deep doubts about the future			0
we are now at another such turning point			0
both sides look to the future knowing that we are deeply interdependent but also deeply conflicted economically and have no common strategic enemy to bind us			0
the people of each country interact on a scale never before achieved , but caricatures often replace realistic images in shaping popular opinions in both countries			0
perhaps most challenging , both countries know they can not continue to pursue the economic policies that have worked to date , yet neither is confident that it can make the changes necessary to thrive in the future			0
in sum , @entity3 - @entity2 relations now encompass real interdependence but also deep mutual distrust , with unusually large uncertainties about each country 's future prospects -- including the future power balance			1
allowing strategic drift at this point will likely lead to our moving further apart , while our degree of success in getting our respective economic houses in order will deeply affect future economic and trade relations			0
in the absence of a major threat to bind @entity2 and the @entity3 , we face the danger of making each other the threat we must guard against			2
that may prove unavoidable , but it will also achieve , at best , limited and very costly long - term security			2
this is not the year to look for serious progress			0
@entity2 will witness a 70 % turnover in its top party , government and military bodies in the coming 13 months , and nobody wants to take major new initiatives now			0
in @entity3 , @entity2 policy has become a part of the election debate over how to make @entity3 bounce back			2
with @entity162 adopting very tough trade and military positions to force @entity2 to change its policies , president @entity161 has committed @entity3 to maintain its leadership role in @entity167 and demanded that @entity2 " play by the rules of the game			1
" he is establishing a body to rigorously enforce @entity3 's trade rules against " countries like @entity2			1
" the net result of the coming 12 months is likely to be deeper distrust in @entity3 - @entity2 relations			1
to have the @entity3 - @entity2 relationship again adapt for the future , therefore , both sides should begin to lay the groundwork to begin serious , long - term engagement as of 2013 around a core topic : what are each country 's core requirements to assure its own overall security in @entity167 , and how can each side meet those requirements without posing an unacceptable threat to the other ? the economic changes each needs to make are remarkably in the interests of the other , too			1
to adapt @entity3 - @entity2 relations for the future in the economic and trade side , we should initiate what will be prolonged and difficult negotiations for a bilateral investment treaty and for a @entity3 - @entity2 free trade agreement			2
the negotiating process on both security and economic issues can itself help move policies and sentiments in the right directions			0
@entity3 - @entity2 relations have never been smooth , but they have served both countries ' interests very well over the past 40 years			2
now they must adapt again , and it is still worth the effort to make this happen			0

on february 21 , 1972 , president @entity4 , @entity2 's @entity5 signed a path - breaking accord
@entity219 : @entity4 's opening to @entity2 had particular motives for both nations
he says concerns have shifted , but @entity3 and @entity2 need each other more than ever
@entity219 : letting relationship drift is a recipe for *antagonism* and security dangers
