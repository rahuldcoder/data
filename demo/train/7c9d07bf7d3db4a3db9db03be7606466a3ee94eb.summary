@entity0 -- top @entity3 strategists in @entity0 are already beginning one of the city 's oldest traditions -- second - guessing a losing election strategy before what is expected to be a stinging defeat in tuesday 's midterm elections			1
one of the key debates to emerge is whether @entity3 candidates were too cautious in avoiding president @entity13 at all costs			1
" running away from the president is never smart , " said one top @entity3 strategist who has worked with both the @entity17 and @entity18 candidates this midterm cycle			1
" you look like chicken s --- , " the strategist added on condition of anonymity			0
a @entity17 official who also asked not to be named so he could speak freely argued @entity3 still have a chance to hold the @entity18			1
" we do n't think anything is done until election day , " the official said in an email that included election day polls in 2012 that showed the president tied with @entity32			0
@entity13 went on to win a decisive victory			2
still , the conventional wisdom to banish the president from key @entity18 battlegrounds , in favor of either @entity41 and @entity42 , vice president @entity43 , and even first lady @entity44 made sense to most @entity18 @entity3 campaigns			1
the president 's low approval numbers plus the conservative terrain at risk for democrats in @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 was a " toxic combination , " as another top strategist put it			2
the problem with that approach , according to @entity3 midterm second - guessers , is that it left the party with little to offer voters			1
" i am becoming convinced that many @entity3 made a mistake in trying to run away from president @entity13 and the @entity3 agenda , " said @entity62 , a former spokesman for @entity18 majority leader @entity63			1
" how is the base supposed to get excited when elected @entity3 are going to such great length to put as much distance as the can between them and a president that was elected twice by the @entity75 people , " @entity62 asked			1
one of the lasting memories of the 2014 midterm elections will likely be @entity18 candidate @entity79 ' refusal to say whether she even voted for @entity13			1
" she was an @entity13 delegate , " complained one strategist about @entity79			2
" of course she voted for him			0
" the president did not want to tell candidates how to run their campaigns , his aides said			2
instead , @entity13 appeared almost exclusively with @entity3 gubernatorial candidates			1
but his message was clearly aimed at firing up his party 's base			0
@entity13 has consistently prodded @entity3 to get off the couch , take their cousin " @entity92 " with them , and vote			1
democrats , the president has argued time and again , have a " congenital defect " when it comes to casting ballots in midterms			0
" the number of eligible voters who vote typically in a midterm is like in the 30s			0
i mean , @entity109 just went through an election -- they got a war going on , they had about 60 percent turnout , " @entity13 said sunday of the percentage of @entity75 who go to the polls in midterm elections			2
" there is no excuse for us to just give away our power			0
if you wonder why things do n't happen , if you wonder why sometimes elected officials do n't seem responsive , it 's because so many of us stay at home , " he added at an event with @entity120 gubernatorial candidate @entity119			0
despite that feisty tone , @entity13 remained behind closed doors monday , one day before the midterms			0
also missing are any mentions of the president 's record			0
@entity13 no longer uses the line about his polices being " on the ballot " on tuesday , after some of his supporters complained publicly			0
but other strategists worry the aversion to all things @entity13 went too far , noting few @entity3 candidates have spent much time pointing to the lowering unemployment rate , among a range of hopeful economic indicators			1
" many @entity3 candidates blurred the choice so much that voters figured ' well if i 'm going to have a choice between two republicans i might as will choose the one that calls themselves one , ' " griped a party operative			2
candidates also matter , several seasoned @entity3 operatives argued			2
@entity157 candidate @entity156 's gaffe in describing the state 's popular @entity158 sen. @entity158 as an " @entity161 farmer who never went to law school , " was a key mistake according to one strategist			0
a @entity156 loss to his @entity167 challenger , @entity166 , would give the @entity167 two @entity18 seats in a state @entity13 won twice , after he defeated @entity42 in the 2008 @entity161 caucuses			1
in a sign of just how much his @entity161 star power has faded in six years , the president was never called in to campaign on behalf of @entity156			0
in addition , the president was kept out of @entity176 and @entity177 , two states he also captured in 2008 and 2012			0
@entity179 , a former @entity13 @entity17 and campaign spokesman , maintained @entity3 are striking the right balance			1
" it makes little sense to publicly deploy him in states he did n't win , " @entity179 said			0
" however , he can and is doing surgical things to help @entity3 candidates like fundraising and rallying the young and diverse constituencies that carried him to victory and could make the difference in close races			2

some @entity3 strategists think candidates tried too hard to avoid the president
president @entity13 has a sagging approval rating nationally and in key states
that said , some on the left think running away from a sitting president is a losing strategy
@entity167 look poised to pick up the six seats they need to *reclaim* the @entity18
