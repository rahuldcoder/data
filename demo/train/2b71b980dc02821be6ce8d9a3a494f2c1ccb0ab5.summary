this week , the elite owners of the @entity1 are considering instituting a 15 - yard penalty for any @entity1 player caught using the n - word on the field			1
why is it bad to demean a player of @entity11 descent , but the pejorative " @entity16 " is still just fine for use as the name of the @entity15 football team ? makes no sense			1
as a @entity19 , a citizen of the @entity21 and someone who participates in the @entity19 community and does n't just claim to be @entity19 because i have a picture somewhere of a great - grandma who had high cheekbones , i wonder : hey @entity1 , why are n't you just as pissed about the @entity27 ? i 'm not black , and although i find the @entity4 repugnant and wrong , i 'm not here to rage about it			1
i 'm here , in fact , to make a point			2
throughout the last @entity1 season , @entity33 diligently and consistently worked to remind the conscientious objector ( not the bigot -- you ca n't get much into the brain of a bigot ) that @entity40 is a racial slur			1
and we , the descendants of those who survived the @entity45 and westward expansion and @entity48 boarding schools , will not sit idly by as opulent white men tell us that the r - word is n't an epithet and that it 's part of their tradition			1
lawmakers step into @entity16 name fray do n't mistake me here , folks			1
privilege in sports is n't just white			0
i encounter african - americans in @entity16 garb and @entity60 in @entity62 jerseys			1
in fact , this was the case last week on the d train here in @entity67 when , in a moment , i had enough of it all and encountered a tall black man with headphones on his ears and a @entity16 lid on his skull			1
he was standing , and i was standing			0
we faced each other , backs to the sliding doors , and i remember staring and glaring at his hat , then at his eyes , then up again to his cap			0
it was n't long , maybe just one stop , before he ripped his headphones off and asked me if i had a problem			0
" with your hat , " i said			0
" so , yeah , i do			0
" he paused for a quick second and seemed a bit perplexed by my response			0
he probably thought i was a mad fan of a different team -- the kind of person who fights in stadium parking lots with beer in his gut and hate in his heart for any insolent denizen who dares don the logo of the visiting team			2
" what a privilege , " i continued , " to be able to walk into a subway and not have to see someone wearing a hat with the stereotypical likeness of your people on it and a racist pejorative to accompany the image			0
" opinion : @entity16 needs to change and it gets better			1
i was on a @entity118 radio show recently discussing the utter vulgarity of the @entity27 when a caller said to me , " you know , it 's so trivial			1
it 's just a word			2
... " " @entity124 is n't ' colored ' just a word , too ? " i barked			2
" would you be so audacious as to make the same argument to an african - american about that word ? " i waited for a loathsome rebuttal , but i all i got in return was dead @entity118 air			2
so , if you 're still curious " what makes the red man red ? " ( thanks again , @entity147 's " @entity146 " ) , all you have to do is go to @entity67 and see the bevy of @entity135 statues , and then go to @entity136 and see the wiggy white men painted in red - face at the @entity62 game and then end up back in @entity140 , @entity141 , where the white and black and brown @entity16 taunt you , and then still ask : " what 's the big deal ? " here 's the big deal			1
i recently asked my native elder in the @entity152 about what he thinks of the term			0
he said , " i 'm not red ... i 'm pissed			0
" and so am i -- because if you 're not pissed , you 're not paying attention			0
join us on @entity159 / @entity158 .			0

@entity161 : why is it bad to use the n - word but ok to call an @entity1 team the @entity27 ?
the @entity1 may institute a 15 - yard penalty for any player using *derogatory* racial *language*
@entity170 : names such as the @entity16 or the @entity62 are wrong
