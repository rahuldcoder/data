@entity0 -- the defense secretary will not ban smoking by troops in war zones despite a recommendation to do so by a @entity8 - commissioned study			1
defense secretary @entity9 says he does not want to compound stress in combat zones by banning smoking			1
secretary @entity9 ' decision stems from concern about the stress troops face , said his spokesman			1
" we are fighting two wars right now , using a force that we are demanding more of than we ever have before			0
they are under enormous stress and strain , and the secretary does not want to compound that stress by taking away from them one of the few outlets they have to relieve that stress , " @entity8 spokesman @entity20 said wednesday			1
a new study commissioned by the @entity8 and the @entity30 recommends a complete ban on tobacco , which would end tobacco sales on military bases and prohibit smoking by anyone in uniform -- including combat troops in the thick of battle			1

over the long term , it can cause serious health problems , including lung cancer and cardiovascular disease			0
the study also says smokeless tobacco use can lead to oral and pancreatic cancer			1
@entity20 said that @entity9 has not seen the report and will consider the recommendations to move towards a goal of a smoke - free military			2

but he predicted that , as smoking is banned on military bases outside combat zones , " then the problem over time will resolve itself , even in combat zones			2
" the founder of the @entity76 likened the situation to that which prevailed during the 1980s , when smoking aboard @entity80 commercial airlines was banned			0
" there was an exception for the cockpit , at least on some airlines , on the theory that you probably do n't want your pilot , if he 's hooked on nicotine , to be cold - turkey while he 's trying to navigate your plane			0
" but , he said , the exception has been phased out			0
