@entity0 -- television stations in @entity0 are calling it " @entity4 , " the saturday deadline for @entity7 troops to completely withdraw from the country under a @entity7 - @entity10 security pact			1
stations aligned with @entity13 and @entity14 extremist groups , many of whom attacked @entity7 troops , have dubbed it the " day of defeating the @entity19 " -- others have called it the " @entity22 " or " @entity23			1
" it 's a day many @entity10 say they have waited for since the 2003 @entity7 - led invasion that toppled @entity26 , even as they admit their country is mired in a political crisis that has raised fears of a return of sectarian violence that nearly tore the country apart at the height of the war			1
" @entity4 , we are all for @entity10 , " prime minister @entity35 said in a mass text message sent saturday morning			1
" i congratulate you and our @entity10 nation on this great historic day , my love and respect to you and your families , your brother @entity35			1
" the celebrations in @entity10 come nearly two weeks after the last convoy of @entity7 troops crossed into @entity46 , ending an almost nine year war that saw more than 4,400 @entity7 military personnel and an estimated 115,000 @entity10 killed			1
under a security agreement signed in 2008 , the @entity7 agreed to withdraw its troops by the end of 2011			1
negotiations to extend the deadline broke down in october after @entity0 's political leaders refused to grant @entity7 troops immunity from @entity10 prosecution , a move that @entity59 leaders said was unacceptable			1
outside a @entity13 mosque in northern @entity0 's @entity64 district , a place where @entity13 and @entity14 once battled one another and @entity7 troops , hundreds of men and boys gathered to listen to religious leaders who asked them to vow to preserve @entity10 's independence			1
one banner read : " this is the start of our spring			1
" the crowd outside the mosque chanted " @entity7 cowards " and " sunnis and @entity14 will remain united in this country no matter what happens			1
" but these celebrations come amid reports of near daily violence that continues to plague the country and a political crisis that has @entity10 's fragile power - sharing government teetering on the brink of collapse			1
on saturday , gunmen attacked a checkpoint manned by anti-al @entity89 fighters in @entity90			0
at least six fighters were shot in the town of @entity95 , southwest of the provincial capital of @entity97 , a police spokesman said			0
@entity10 's @entity14 , @entity13 and @entity99 political leaders have square off in recent weeks over a warrant issued for the arrest of vice president @entity102 , who is accused of organizing his security detail into a death squad that targeted government and military officials			1
the arrest warrant was issued shortly after @entity102 's @entity13 - backed @entity108 announced it would boycott @entity109 , saying @entity35 was cutting it out of the decision - making process			0
@entity111 has denied the charges , saying the accusations are politically motivated amid the rivalry between his political bloc and @entity35 's @entity14 majority bloc			0
@entity35 has demanded that @entity99 lawmakers hand over the @entity13 vice president , who has denied the charges and refuses to return to @entity0 from northern @entity10 's semi-autonomous @entity99 region			1
the situation has been further inflamed this week with a political bloc loyal to radical , anti-american shiite cleric @entity123 calling for the dissolution of parliament and early elections			0
there was little mention of the withdrawal deadline in the @entity7 , where weeks earlier president @entity130 welcomed home some of the last @entity7 troops			1
rather , the focus in @entity59 has been on pending arms sales to @entity10 and concerns about its political stability			2
" as you know , our main focus has been in trying to encourage the @entity10 political groups to talk to each other and to create a broad national dialogue about the way forward , " @entity137 , a @entity138 spokeswoman , told reporters friday			2
" with regard to the arms sales , these , as you know , are long planned and they 're part of the transition process for the @entity10 to manage their own security within their own resources			2
" there are questions , though , about the actions of @entity10 's security forces			2
@entity158 , in recent months , has reported that @entity10 security forces have beaten and detained anti-government demonstrators protesting corruption and demanding more political freedoms			2
@entity163 , the brother of @entity10 journalist @entity164 who threw his shoes at then - president @entity166 during a 2008 news conference in @entity0 , said saturday he was detained a day earlier at an anti-american protest			1
by telephone from a @entity0 police station , @entity164 told @entity1 that he and a younger brother had been held overnight			0
" if i could do it all over again , i would , " he said			0
@entity173 was among a small group of less than a dozen protesters who gathered friday to mark " @entity4 " in @entity0 's @entity177 -- the place where @entity26 's statue was toppled in one of the most iconic moments of the invasion in 2003			0
@entity173 said they planned to burn the @entity7 flag at 2:15 p.m. -- the exact time he says @entity7 troops raised the flag in the square in april of 2003			2
@entity10 security forces swarmed the square shortly after the protest began , and ordered the group to disperse because they did not have a permit			2
a @entity1 crew present at the protest was banned from filming despite having a permit to film in @entity0			0
an @entity10 tv crew also present had their two cameras confiscated			2
when security forces moved to quash the protest , the younger @entity164 brother , @entity200 , standing on the pedestal where @entity26 's statue once stood , lit the @entity7 flag on fire			0
@entity205 , the protest organizer , was then beaten			0
a source familiar with the case told @entity1 a policeman hit @entity164 after he " provoked the policeman			0
" the source said commanders at the scene stopped the policeman , but the @entity1 team , repeatedly asked to leave , saw policemen surrounding @entity164 as he was beaten			0
the source spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information			0
both @entity164 brothers were held at a @entity0 police station over night , according to the source , because a complaint was filed against them by local police			0
the brothers told @entity1 saturday that they were eventually released			0
@entity1 's @entity224 contributed to this report .			0
