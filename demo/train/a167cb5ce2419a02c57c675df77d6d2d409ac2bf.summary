@entity0 -- in this age of bitter partisanship , it is not surprising that congressional approval ratings are at an all - time low			1
but how did our national legislature get to the point where only 10 % of @entity9 approve of its actions ? the answer : @entity12 no longer represents the will of the people , and it has n't for a very long time			1
the @entity15 has become another @entity16 where a rarefied few supposedly represent the needs of the many			1
and that 's the main reason that hyper - partisanship and special interests seem to control the legislative agenda			2
we have all been disenfranchised			0
a quick trip back to fifth grade history class reminds us that the @entity15 was established as the lower house , intended to be " of the people , " according to @entity29			1
it was to ensure that individual citizens had a voice in federal legislation while the @entity16 was meant to be more deliberative and represent the interest of the states			0
but population growth has cut the ties between representatives and those they represent			2
a seat in the @entity15 has gone from representing 33,000 people to more than 700,000 today			1
@entity9 basically has two upper houses of @entity12 with less and less representation of the people			1
the reason is as cynical as you might imagine : self - interest and power			2
it is in the interest of individual members of @entity12 and the two political parties to maintain this status quo			2
with each member of @entity12 representing a very large number of people , representatives receive tremendous attention from special interests			2
it is relatively easy for these groups to buy the support of the 218 members it takes to pass a bill , and congressional seats have increased in value as the economy and government have grown			0
it 's not surprising that running for @entity12 has become a multimillion - dollar fundraising challenge in many districts around the country			1
and , it is also not surprising that many members become millionaires once they leave @entity12 -- if they are the rare ones who were n't rich to begin with			2
the real resistance to congressional reform is @entity12 itself			2
the @entity83 and @entity84 parties enjoy a duopoly : no third party , or even a faction within the parties , can disrupt their stranglehold , especially when redistricting and gerrymandering have created solidly @entity83 and @entity84 seats			0
the result is that members and even candidates continue to reflect the more partisan positions of the party , regardless of the will of the people			0
although roughly 40 % of @entity9 describe themselves as independent , @entity99 continues to be driven by the right - and left - wing believers who form the base of each of the parties , resulting in acrimony and stalemate			1
the solution is relatively simple			0
for the first 140 years of the republic , the @entity15 increased in size with the population in varying degrees , going from 65 members originally to 435			1
a @entity12 and president enacted the @entity111 , which arbitrarily capped the number at 435 members			1
although the @entity9 population has more than doubled since 1929 , the individual 's voice in the federal government has diminished			2
now is the time to re-establish that voice with a @entity12 that is closer to the level of representation envisioned by the founders			1
if we use the original ratio ( 1 member per 33,000 ) , we would have a @entity15 with nearly 10,000 members , which seems extreme and more like direct , as opposed to representative , democracy			1
however , staying at 435 also seems arbitrary and extreme			0
the founders envisioned population growth and proposed a maximum ratio of 1 per 50,000 , which today would produce a @entity12 of slightly more than 6,000 members			1
let 's assume they were off by 100 % , and we might envision a @entity12 with 1 member per 100,000 people or 3,000 members			1
as points of comparison , a constituency in the @entity139 is roughly 90,000 people , and the @entity144 government that the @entity9 helped establish is at 100,000 people per representative			0
yes , that 's right : today @entity144 's legislature is seven times more representative than our federal government			0
the idea of 3,000 or more members of @entity12 , constituting a @entity99 - based power elite , would scare people if we continue to apply the 1780s approach to governing			1
but our government needs to evolve to reflect the world we live in			0
what if members of @entity12 went to @entity99 quarterly for two week conventions ? the rest of the time they could live in their districts , using widely adopted technologies to collaborate and vote online			1
it is ridiculous that a member must be " present " to cast a vote in @entity12 in 2012			2
the role of a member of a much larger @entity12 should be part - time , making it more attractive for people of varying backgrounds to run			1
most importantly , in most districts it would no longer require millions of dollars to get elected , so members would be less likely to be corrupted			0
many might argue that such a large number would lead to gridlock based on sheer numbers			0
really ? more unproductive than where we are today ? properly used technology can enable large numbers of people to collaborate effectively , as they do in some leading corporations			0
for example , @entity183 operates a disparate group of businesses around the world with very few physical meetings in headquarters			0
most @entity9 are not ideologues			0
they want government to work efficiently , represent them well , provide some collective services and solve problems			0
congressional reform is gathering some momentum			0
but those in power will cling to the status quo			0
we need to fight for the right of representation envisioned by the founding fathers			0
it 's time for : " @entity15 3000 : the @entity205 "			1
who 's in ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			2

@entity12 ' approval rating hit an all - time low of 10 %
@entity209 says a growing population has left @entity12 much less representative
size of the @entity15 has been frozen at 435 since 1929
@entity209 : *shrink* districts , expand the @entity15 and make seats in @entity12 part - time
