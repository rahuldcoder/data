-- a sailor is accusing the @entity2 of baselessly trying to discharge him for " unprofessional conduct " in an effort to get around the recent " do n't ask , do n't tell " repeal , after being found asleep in the same bed with another male sailor			1
navy petty officer @entity8 , a student at the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , told @entity0 that on the night of february 5 , a male sailor stopped by to watch the @entity14 tv show " @entity15			1
" " he has come over to watch shows in the past , " @entity8 said			1
the two watched the show on his bed but accidentally fell asleep			1
@entity8 says his roommate walked in around midnight			1
" my roommate walked in and it woke me up , " @entity8 said			1
he then woke up his friend , navy petty officer @entity23 , who according to @entity8 , immediately left the room			1
but the @entity2 is proceeding with discharging @entity8 , charging him with " willful failure to exhibit professional conduct , " @entity8 ' lawyer , @entity26 said			1
" it is a violation of the @entity30 for sailors to act unprofessionally in the barracks			1
it is considered unprofessional conduct to share the same bed in @entity2 barracks , " said @entity33 , a spokesman for the @entity9			1
@entity8 , who claims nothing sexual happened , said they were both clothed , him in pajama pants and a white t - shirt and @entity42 in boxers , and that two were not under the covers together			1
@entity8 was lying above the covers while @entity42 lay below			1
the play - by - play given by @entity8 is substantiated by the @entity9 investigating documents , although a different account on the amount of clothing worn was given by @entity8 ' roommate who claimed in his naval statement that both sailors were only dressed in their boxers			1
@entity8 ' roommate , who was uncomfortable by what he saw , according to @entity26 , @entity8 ' attorney , moved out of the room a day later and reported the incident to command officials			1
an investigation was launched , ending with the command attempting to punish @entity8 and @entity42 by a " @entity61 , " a non-judicial procedure meant to avoid a court martial			1
@entity42 , who declined to comment on the case , accepted the mast and punishment but @entity8 refused , moving the @entity2 to begin proceedings to discharge him			1
punishment by @entity61 could have resulted in loss of rank , forfeiture of pay , or jeopardized @entity8 ' top secret security clearance , @entity26 said			1
" i 'm not pleading guilty to something that i did n't do			0
i did not commit a crime , " said @entity8			2
" i am the type of person that takes responsibility for my actions			0
if i break a rule , i take my punishment			0
and i know i did not break any rules			0
" @entity26 also said he is adamant that no crime was committed			0
" in the end , @entity8 was charged with falling asleep while watching a show on his computer while on his bed over the covers where another man under the covers was also sleeping			1
this is not a crime and never will be as there was and is no duty to avoid such a circumstance as a matter of laws , " said @entity26 in a statement sent to the @entity2			2
@entity8 and his lawyer charge that the @entity101 suspects @entity8 of being gay and wants to discharge him for that reason alone			2
" @entity104 suspects that @entity8 is a homosexual but has no proof			2
it can not invoke ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' because there is no homosexual conduct and there is no admission of homosexuality			0
yet this homophobic command is using its suspicions to reach the same result as though there were , " said @entity26			0
" this is bigotry disguised as the rule of law			0
" @entity8 would not comment on his sexual orientation saying , " that is my business and my business alone "			2
president @entity121 signed the so - called " do n't ask , do n't tell " repeal into law in december but it 's not officially off the books until secretary of defense @entity126 , the chairman of the @entity128 and the president give the ok that the military is ready to implement the repeal			0
for now , the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy remains in place , although no military personnel have been discharged under that policy since october , when @entity126 changed procedures to have such separations reviewed at the highest levels , a point , @entity26 says , was not forgotten by the @entity101			0
" the secretary of defense has said that ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' cases will be reviewed at the highest levels			0
this case is disguised as misconduct to avoid that result , " said @entity26			0
" this is a subterfuge being used by this commander because he does not have the elements of proof to separate him for homosexuality , but he suspects homosexuality , so he has created this illusion that @entity8 has engaged in misconduct of some form			2
" the @entity2 denies the separation proceedings are based on the suspicion of homosexual behavior			2
" @entity9 is not administratively processing either of these sailors for separation based on sexual orientation , " said @entity33			0
but one gay rights group worries this case may be an example of some in the military trying to get around the " do n't ask do n't tell " repeal by charging suspected homosexuals with other offenses			0
" we 've seen this before , " said @entity169 , executive director of @entity170 , the nation 's largest organization of gay and lesbian troops and veterans			0
" here is the classic text book case of trumping up charges and exaggerating an event to try to punish someone			0
and this is exactly what the senior defense leadership has said would not and should not happen when @entity185 goes away			0
" for now , the 21 - year - old @entity8 says that even though he is disappointed in the @entity101 , he just wants to keep his job and finish his training to become a nuclear operator on an aircraft carrier or a submarine			2
" i enjoyed my job			0
i enjoyed the environment and i was interested in what i was learning			0
it has been challenging but it was definitely something that i wanted to complete , " said @entity8 .			2
