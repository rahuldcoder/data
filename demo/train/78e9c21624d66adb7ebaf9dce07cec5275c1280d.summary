@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is stifled by gridlock			1
as @entity1 gov. @entity5 said in his speech at the @entity7 , " we drift from conflict to conflict , with little or no resolution			0
" even the most routine budgeting decisions turn into high - stakes showdowns with threats of default and government shutdowns			1
the party leaders are deep into a mindset with which they feel free to threaten , cajole and refuse to act until the very last moment			1
big decisions are put off			0
small issues are barely resolved			0
gridlock , however , is not politically neutral			2
the conventional wisdom is that under current conditions nothing gets done -- and neither party benefits			2
but in fact , the chronic battles over budget decisions tend to benefit the @entity29 agenda			0
while it seems that neither side is making progress when the government machine grinds to a halt , in fact @entity35 keep losing as the agenda shifts toward the right			1
gridlock benefits @entity29 and , more broadly , conservative politics , for several reasons			2
the first is that without normalized and predictable budgets , government agencies ca n't engage in long - term planning			1
agency heads have to scramble from month to month just to keep existing programs intact			2
the notion of designing long - term plans to improve and strengthen programs goes out the window			2
even an agency like the @entity51 ca n't count on having the funds that it needs in dire emergencies			0
the result is that the key agencies of government are steadily weakened			1
a government in gridlock also fails to update programs as times change			1
as the political scientists @entity68 and @entity70 found , the inflation - adjusted value of welfare payments , the minimum wage , food stamps and unemployment benefits all fell steadily after the 1970s			0
the second reason that democrats are harmed by gridlock is because a dysfunctional @entity3 fuels public distrust in the federal government			1
a @entity2 / @entity78 poll recently found that only 15 % of the public trusts government to do what is right always or most of the time , a notable decline from the 25 % level in september 2010			2
when the public does not trust the government , @entity29 win			2
after all , a key argument of modern conservatism has been that government intervention , at least when it comes to domestic issues , is bad			2
" @entity91 is not the solution to our problem , " president @entity95 said , " government is the problem			0
" that argument resonates much more when voters are watching the current circus in the nation 's capital			0
it is not surprising that the conservative movement flourished in the 1970s and 1980s , two decades that witnessed a sharp decline in public trust of government institutions			0
as gridlock generates doubts about the ability of politicians to handle problems , the ability of @entity35 to win support for federal programs vastly diminishes			1
finally , gridlock shrinks the political space that exists to propose new programs			1
with gridlock this strong , and a budget process that is so grueling , most of the energy in @entity3 turns toward protecting existing programs from elimination			1
ultimately , a strong @entity35 can only thrive when it is possible to push new government initiatives			1
otherwise , the party loses much of its vibrancy and becomes a more moderate shadow of the @entity29			0
while @entity29 push to cut domestic programs , democrats are left simply calling for smaller cuts			0
this is not the kind of rallying cry that a party needs to galvanize strong majorities , nor is it a way to build a historical legacy			0
for all these reasons , a period of gridlock is a period of @entity29 strength			0
perhaps the toughest part about this for @entity35 is that the impact of the paralysis is not visible to most @entity149 , including many of the party 's most loyal supporters			1
voters simply see an entire system that is broken and one where nothing appears to get done			0
the reality , however , is that @entity29 keep moving forward as their opponents stand still			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			1

@entity161 : on the *surface* , it seems gridlock hurts both *parites*
he says @entity35 suffer more since their party places more reliance on government
gridlock prevents government agencies from planning and taking the initiative
@entity159 : focus for @entity35 shifts from proposing to protecting government programs
