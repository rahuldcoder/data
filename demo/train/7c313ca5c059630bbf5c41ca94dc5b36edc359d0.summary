-- in a matter of days , they transformed from caretakers into patients			0
the two women live thousands of miles apart , but the first known @entity8 cases contracted outside @entity9 during this outbreak have one striking similarity : both were health care workers , caring for someone infected with the deadly virus			2
as a nurse in @entity18 and a nurse 's assistant in @entity22 fight for their lives , a key question looms : are people who are putting themselves in harm 's way to care for @entity8 victims receiving the training and equipment they need ? no , says @entity30 , vice president of @entity31			1
" it 's really a disaster waiting to happen , " she told @entity0 's " the lead with @entity35 " on thursday			1
the union is pushing for more equipment , training and education for nurses , @entity36 said			1
a survey of 1,900 nurses by the union found that 76 % said their hospital had not communicated any policy for the potential admission of patients infected by @entity8			1
it 's a " startling statistic , " @entity0 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity49 said , particularly since the @entity51 said in may that it was distributing guidelines to hospitals around the country			1
" infectious disease protocols , universal precautions should be the same , really , in hospitals all over the country			0
they should apply here with regard to @entity8 as well , " @entity49 said			1
" but obviously , that 's not happening			0
these nurses who are a part of that survey just do n't feel comfortable as things stand now			2
" @entity51 chief blames protocol breach the @entity51 is " doubling down " on outreach and training to increase awareness of @entity8 and make sure @entity73 hospitals " think @entity8 , " @entity51 director dr. @entity68 said monday			1
hospitals should be skilled at taking travel histories of people who show @entity8 symptoms and should isolate those who have been to @entity79 , @entity80 or @entity81 , @entity68 said			1
and the @entity51 is also planning more hands - on training at hospitals and outreach to health departments			1
as authorities confirmed that the @entity18 nurse had contracted @entity8 , @entity68 was quick to point to a breach in protocol			1
@entity68 said he was n't pointing fingers , but trying to pinpoint what happened			0
" stopping @entity8 is hard , " he said , adding that the @entity51 will do anything possible to protect health care workers			1
the nurse , @entity95 , had cared for @entity96 , who contracted @entity8 in @entity79 and died of the illness at the hospital			2
@entity68 said he would not be surprised if there were additional cases among those who cared for @entity96 , but so far , no one is showing symptoms			0
on monday morning , an official with direct knowledge of the @entity108 nurse 's case told @entity0 that @entity51 disease detectives interviewed the nurse several times and thought there were " inconsistencies " in the type of personal protective gear she wore and with the process used to put the gear on and remove it			1
health care workers on the front lines often get sick in the early stages of an outbreak , while dealing with patients who are highly infectious , @entity49 said			2
that 's why there are guidelines for what protective gear they should wear when dealing with @entity8 patients			1
but the @entity18 case is concerning , he said			0
" the patient was the most infectious , " he said , " but she should have been protected			0
" @entity51 director @entity68 faces rising tide of criticism husband of infected nurse 's assistant writes scathing letter the nurse 's assistant in @entity143 with @entity8 remains in critical condition and is having trouble breathing , authorities said			1
the @entity146 and @entity147 said the hospital where @entity149 is being treated does n't meet all the standards set for centers capable of @entity8 care			2
in a scathing letter , @entity153 , her husband , said she received only 30 minutes of training in putting on protective gear and called for the resignation of @entity22 's regional health minister over how the case has been handled			1
" please explain to me how one puts on a protective suit , since unfortunately my wife does n't have a master 's degree in that , " @entity153 wrote in a letter distributed by a family spokeswoman			2
" @entity149 had 30 minutes or a little more to learn how to do so through a colleague			0
" he fired back at criticism that the family had gone on vacation			0
" no one told us that we could n't do what we did , because the protocol did not tell us that we could not do that , " @entity153 wrote			0
" now i know that in other countries they quarantine health care workers after treating an @entity8 patient			2
even though i am only a welder , i understand that if we had done this my wife would possibly not be battling between life and death			0
" experts note ways @entity51 is getting it wrong are hospitals ready ? president @entity188 wants federal authorities to immediately take further measures to ensure that health care workers are able to follow protocols for treating @entity8 patients			1
he met with senior administration members at the @entity195 on monday afternoon for an update on its response to the @entity18 case and the broader effort to make sure the country is prepared to handle an outbreak			0
of the thousands of hospitals in the @entity73 , only four have been training for years to deal with highly infectious diseases such as @entity8 : @entity204 in @entity205 , the @entity206 in @entity207 , the @entity208 in @entity209 and @entity210 in @entity211			1
" they have the management , the processes , the implementation in place that if an @entity8 patient comes in , just right away they know what to do , " said @entity217 , who teaches public health preparedness at @entity219			2
but if someone with symptoms of @entity8 shows up at any other hospital , as @entity96 did , the hospital might not be ready			0
" it may not be that every single hospital is in fact prepared for this , " said @entity227 , associate professor of biology at @entity229			0
" we may have to think about regional centers that are best prepared to deal with @entity8 patients			0
" at the @entity237 , where a man with possible @entity8 symptoms was admitted monday , chief medical officer dr. @entity236 said they were keeping an extra eye on protective equipment after speaking with officials at @entity204 and in @entity18			2
while workers are putting on or taking off their gear , someone is watching to make sure they 're doing it correctly , he said			0
" we have trained spotters to make sure that everything is put on and taken off in the proper fashion , " he told reporters , " to keep everybody safe			0
" @entity0 's @entity252 and @entity253 contributed to this report .			0

@entity49 : it 's a " startling statistic " that 76 % of nurses surveyed do n't know @entity8 policies
nurse 's union leader : " it 's really a disaster waiting to happen "
the @entity51 says it will increase training and make hospitals " think @entity8 "
husband of @entity143 patient says she received little training on protective gear
