-- @entity2 new boy @entity1 was sent off for the first time in his professional career in a 1 - 1 draw against @entity6 in their @entity8 opener on sunday at @entity9			1
despite being down to 10 men , @entity2 took a 46th minute lead through @entity12 , but were denied victory by a @entity15 own goal in injury time			1
@entity1 , who joined @entity2 after being released by champions @entity17 , was sent off for a two - footed lunge on @entity6 defender @entity19 just before half - time of the heavyweight encounter			1
referee @entity22 had no hesitation in giving @entity1 his marching orders as @entity19 , a summer capture by @entity26 from @entity27 , appeared to be seriously injured by the scything challenge			1
but he came out for the second half to ironic cheers from the home fans , who had the last laugh when @entity19 was himself sent off for a second yellow card on the stroke of the final whistle			0
@entity6 had the better of a cagey first half and with @entity2 down to 10 men were expected to take advantage , but fell behind straight after the break			2
@entity39 , who is set to leave @entity2 , played in @entity12 who crashed the ball past @entity41 at his near post and high into the net			2
@entity2 fans were cheered by the second half appearance of substitute @entity46 , but he had few glimpses of goal as @entity6 pressed for an equalizer			1
@entity50 headed wide and substitute @entity51 forced @entity15 into a brilliant fingertip save			0
but soon afterwards the @entity54 international was shaking his head after an uncharacteristic error gifted @entity6 their equalizer			0
under challenge from @entity59 , @entity15 dropped the ball but appeared to have got away with his mistake until the ball hit the post and he fumbled the rebound , allowing it to cross the line			0
there was still time for @entity70 to force @entity41 into a fine save from a free kick and for @entity19 to be booked twice , the second for deliberate handball , to be shown a late , late red			2
new @entity2 manager @entity75 told @entity76 that he was a " little bit disappointed , " that his team had not held out for three points but hailed his side 's resilience			0
" it was a remarkable performance to have come so close to victory after playing all of the second half with 10 men , " he added .			0
