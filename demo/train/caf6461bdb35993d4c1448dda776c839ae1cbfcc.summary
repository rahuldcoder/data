-- @entity1 had a bit of an unusual childhood			1
he grew up in a virtual museum			0
even now when he wanders around the lobby at @entity7 's iconic @entity6 , @entity1 , 47 , sometimes flashes back to being a kid on a tricycle , winding his way around original furniture designed by depression - era artisans			1
for @entity1 , whose family has operated the federally owned property for a half century , the @entity14 ski lodge has become a living scrapbook of his life			1
from birth until college he divided his days between school in neighboring @entity22 and @entity23 -- with its rustic stone masonry , massive wooden beams , paintings , wood marquetry , custom wrought iron accoutrements and linoleum murals			1
" there are museum aspects of this place , and i suppose the government could say , ' let 's make it into a museum and have ropes and glass and charge admission , ' but we 'd rather it be a ski lodge than a museum			1
" since its birth in the late 1930s as a @entity46 project to create hundreds of jobs for @entity22 workers , craftsmen and artisans , @entity23 has dug out its own place in @entity53 culture			1
but it also bills itself as @entity53 's only year - round ski area			1
' heeeeere 's @entity55 ! ' and , if the photos strike you as familiar , it may be because @entity23 has built a respectable resume as a location for films such as " @entity62 , " starring @entity63 , " @entity64 , " starring @entity65 and the horror classic " @entity67 " with @entity68			1
in a way , you could say the @entity23 played the starring role in that 1980 film			2
the lodge stood as the haunted @entity73 , but only in exterior shots			0
all interior scenes were shot elsewhere , said @entity1 , who helped the film crew during the shoot			2
" i did some work outside for the crew 's helicopter shots , " he said			0
" we 'd have to make sure that the place looked desolate and that no one was around			0
i remember hiding in the trees so they could get the shots			0
" growing up at the lodge for @entity88 meant making fast friends with children of guests who vacationed there every year			2
it was the place where he enjoyed his first legal beer on his 21st birthday -- in the lodge 's @entity98 's @entity97 with its breathtaking view of the @entity101			2
the site for hundreds of guests ' weddings over the years , @entity23 was where @entity1 's own younger brother chose to tie the knot			1
it was where his late father announced the @entity110 arrival of @entity111 and a pair of authentic reindeer for guests ' wide - eyed children			0
" i still kinda think it was really @entity111 , " he laughs			0
" why not ? " night skiing but as one might expect , so much about growing up at @entity23 revolved around skiing			1
@entity1 learned to ski at age 3			1
later , he says , to get them away from the tv , " my mom would make us go out and ski for at least an hour before we could watch football			0
" " at one point during adolescence we convinced @entity127 that it would be a good idea to ski all night long on @entity129 's , " he said			2
" it got kind of crazy for a while there			0
we had all these people skiing and sleeping and whatever all over the place			0
" now listed on the @entity135 , @entity23 came uncomfortably close to being destroyed before @entity1 's father began operating it in 1955			1
four previous operators had n't had much success running the lodge , and in 1953 , the @entity140 thought of @entity23 as more of a headache than anything else , @entity1 said			1
options at the time included either burning it or dismantling it until @entity1 's father , @entity88 , entered the picture			1
the family 's permit to operate @entity23 expires in 2038			1
' you 've really got something big here ' local snowboarding entrepreneur @entity154 remembers @entity155 , who passed away in 2006 , as a visionary			0
@entity154 founded @entity158 in 1989 , when most @entity53 ski areas were shunning the relatively new sport			2
" it was one of those memories that you 'll never forget , " @entity154 said , remembering a day on a snowfield in the early 90s			0
" @entity88 stopped me and he looked me in the eye and made sure that i got it			0
he said snowboarding was going to be really big			0
' you 've really got something here , @entity154 , ' he told me			0
" today , @entity154 says @entity14 's snowboarding camps gross millions of dollars each year			1
last summer @entity158 's 22 - foot halfpipe hosted several @entity176 team members , including 2010 gold medallist @entity178			1
although @entity178 stayed at @entity23 during his visit last summer , many guests come with no intention of boarding or skiing or hiking , said @entity185 , author of " @entity6 : the history , art , and craft of an @entity189			1
" " the artwork has made @entity23 its own destination apart from the mountain , " she said			2
" it retains the feel of the 1930s -- that early period of auto - recreation and being in hotels with big lobbies when all the guests came together at dinner			2
it 's sort of a living museum			0
" strolling around the lodge offers guests one surprise after another : wooden stair post newels carved in the shape of bears , owls and other animals ; wrought iron fireplace andirons forged from train rails ; lamps , iron - fashioned door handles and specially designed seat cushions			2
the main lounge is dominated by an amazing three - story stone chimney with six fireplaces			2
" much of the building 's massive beams are held together with unique joints and big wooden pins that lock the things together , " said @entity220 , the @entity140 administrator			0
" i 've always enjoyed that and the interaction between the black wrought iron and the natural wood			0
" old stimulus , new stimulus ironically , the @entity46 project which cost about $ 1 million in 1937 is benefiting from $ 4.25 million in 2009 federal stimulus			1
adjusted for inflation , $ 1 million in 1937 equals more than $ 15 million now , according to federal calculations			1
$ 4.25 million now , equals about $ 282,000 in 1937			1
the new stimulus funds are earmarked for painting , replacement of a water main and improvements for disabled guests , @entity1 said			1
it 's unclear how many jobs will be created by the stimulus funds , but @entity88 guesses about a hundred jobs and ten different projects			1
" the building is old and it faces huge environmental pressures being at that elevation in that kind of weather , " said @entity247 , @entity23 's newly retired archeologist with the @entity140			2
" things like electrical wiring , plumbing , water lines , sewer lines -- unseen components of the lodge -- really need a lot of attention , ' @entity247 said			0
" @entity262 is trying to address that			0
" @entity247 , @entity220 , @entity185 , @entity154 and @entity1 have written about their love for the hotel in an upcoming book " @entity6 : a @entity268 -- @entity269 , " due out this fall			0
it was n't until @entity247 began caring for @entity23 's treasures 20 years ago that he really began to understand the bond that many guests form during their visits			2
" everybody owns it , " he said			0
" that was the big surprise to me			0
i did n't expect the general public to be so in love with it			0
