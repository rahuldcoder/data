@entity0 -- lawyers within the @entity6 administration disagreed with the president 's decision that @entity10 participation in the @entity13 - led @entity12 military mission does n't come under the @entity14 , @entity3 spokesman @entity2 said monday			1
president @entity6 is in a stand - off with @entity3 speaker @entity16 over the issue , and @entity18 might vote on measures to restrict funding for the mission this week to protest what @entity16 says is @entity6 's violation of the war powers law			1
the president disagrees , based on a legal analysis of the situation backed by his general counsel , the @entity25 and defense secretary @entity26 , @entity2 said			0
" this is not a unanimous legal decision within the administration , and it would be shocking if it were , " @entity2 said in reference to what he called constant debate over the war powers measure since it was passed in 1973			1
" ... but the president makes the decision			0
obviously , his @entity3 ( and ) @entity25 lawyer also agree with his assessment , and we feel very confident that the legal reasoning is sound			0
" @entity2 also noted that @entity47 lawyers took part in the discussion , but he did n't include them among those he listed as supporting @entity6			2
" as the @entity47 has stated publicly , its views were heard , " @entity2 told reporters			0
@entity3 @entity55 sources told @entity1 on monday that several options are under consideration for votes this week -- probably thursday -- to exert some congressional control over the @entity12 mission			2
no decision will be made on how to proceed until @entity55 legislators return tuesday from a long weekend in their districts			0
@entity64 : should @entity18 cut off funding ? one idea is a vote to prohibit funding for any ground troops in @entity12			1
@entity6 has pledged no ground forces will be sent to the mission , and the @entity3 @entity55 sources said the proposal would be intended to prevent any possible escalation in the mission and give legislators a chance to express their disapproval			2
" @entity80 ( the legislation ) needs to have enough teeth for it to be to worth it , " said one senior @entity3 @entity55 aide			0
the @entity3 already was planning to take up the 2012 defense spending bill this week , and legislators including liberal @entity88 rep. @entity87 of @entity89 intend to propose an amendment to cut off funding for the @entity12 mission			1
according to the @entity3 @entity55 sources , separate votes on the @entity12 mission are likely before the defense bill comes up in order to allow legislators to signal their displeasure through legislation that does n't go as far as the proposal by @entity87			2
in addition , @entity3 members were further angered by news of strong disagreement within the @entity6 administration over the president 's analysis of whether the @entity12 mission came under the @entity14			1
@entity107 : debate over @entity14 the @entity109 reported saturday that a lead attorney for the @entity47 's @entity111 as well as counsel at the @entity113 argued internally that the president needs congressional authorization for the @entity12 mission , and the president overruled them			1
@entity2 's comments monday acknowledged the disagreements , but portrayed them as part of the normal discourse on the war powers legislation			2
" for me to get up and tell you that by some miracle , every lawyer in this administration was in agreement on that issue , you would n't believe me , because it 's simply been too contentious for now 38 years , " @entity2 said			0
even if the @entity3 passes measures intended to limit funding for the @entity12 mission , it is unlikely the @entity133 would do the same			2
on sunday , two influential @entity55 senators said @entity18 should support the military campaign to send the proper message to allies and foes			2
" the president 's done a lousy job of communicating and managing our involvement in @entity12 , but i will be no part of an effort to defund @entity12 or to try to cut off our efforts to bring ( @entity12 leader @entity147 ) @entity148 down , " conservative sen. @entity149 of @entity150 told @entity154 's " @entity153 , " later adding that @entity6 " needs to step up his game with @entity12 but @entity18 should sort of shut up and not empower @entity148			1
" @entity155 also backed the @entity12 mission , saying @entity6 was right to limit the scope of @entity10 involvement and that he believes the president has complied with the @entity14			1
" what was going on in @entity12 was considered vital interest by some of our closest allies			0
those are the same allies that have come to our support and assistance in @entity170 , " @entity26 told @entity1 's " @entity171			0
" " and so it seems to me the kind of limited measured role that the president decided on , in support of our allies who did consider it a vital interest , is a legitimate way to look at this problem			2
" one of the @entity55 sources noted that the @entity55 leadership is facing the same dilemma it did earlier this month , when @entity87 was pushing a resolution that would have withdrawn all @entity10 forces from the @entity12 mission			1
to prevent that from passing , @entity16 was forced to counter with a watered - down version that gave the president two weeks to send @entity18 information justifying the @entity10 strategy in @entity12			1
@entity6 responded with a report to @entity18 last week that argued the limited role of @entity10 forces in the @entity13 - led @entity12 mission failed to constitute engaging in hostilities as defined by the @entity198			1
on friday , @entity16 said he specifically asked if the @entity47 's @entity111 agreed with the administration 's legal analysis , and that the @entity3 's failure to answer that question made cutting funds for the mission a possibility			0
" @entity207 will not allow the @entity3 to continue skirting its obligations to the @entity10 people , this @entity18 , and the laws of this nation , " @entity16 said in a statement			1
" over the coming week , our members will review all options available to hold the administration to account			0
" passed in 1973 , the @entity14 gives the president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending @entity10 forces to war , followed by a 30 - day extension to end the hostilities			1
that 90 - day period ended sunday			0
in the @entity133 , @entity55 sen. @entity222 of @entity223 and @entity88 sen. @entity224 of @entity225 have drafted a resolution that supports the @entity12 mission			0
if adopted by @entity18 , the resolution would serve as congressional authorization under the @entity14 , they say			0
congressional opponents of the @entity12 mission include liberals such as @entity87 who generally oppose any war effort , as well as some republicans who complain its objective of civilian protection fails to match the stated @entity10 goal of @entity148 's ouster			1
the opponents also say the @entity12 situation could become a stalemate that drains resources at a time of mounting federal deficits that must be addressed			0
the @entity3 , however , says incremental progress is occurring through increasing diplomatic , political and military pressure on @entity148 to step down			0
@entity2 has repeatedly emphasized that @entity6 had kept his word to the @entity10 people that the initial @entity10 leadership role in the mission would get reduced to a supporting role , and no @entity10 ground troops would take part			1
even though the @entity133 in march unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution supporting a no - fly zone over @entity12 , some @entity55 now express total opposition to the @entity10 support for that effort			1
in its report on the mission , titled " @entity262 in @entity12 , " the administration said the cost of military and humanitarian operations through june 3 was about $ 800 million			2
it estimated the total cost through september 30 would be $ 1.1 billion			0
@entity1 's @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity270 contributed to this report .			0

the dispute involves the @entity10 role in the @entity13 - led @entity12 military mission
president @entity6 decided he did n't need war powers authorization from @entity18
house speaker @entity16 warns @entity18 may try to cut mission funding over the issue
