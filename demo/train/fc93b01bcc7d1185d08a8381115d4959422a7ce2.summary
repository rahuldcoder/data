@entity0 -- your hotel , health club and neighborhood pool can remain open this weekend without fear of violating the law			1
the @entity8 said thursday it is delaying for 60 days a new law that requires all public pools to install " lifts " or provide other means to make pools accessible to disabled individuals			1
the law was passed in 2010 and was scheduled to take effect thursday			1
but in recent months , there has been widespread confusion about what sort of pools are required to make the change , whether pools must install permanent lifts or can use cheaper portable lifts and whether one lift could service more than one pool			1
as the thursday deadline neared , hotels and other pool operators nationwide unleashed a torrent of calls and letters to industry associations and politicians , saying the rule threatened to close pools from coast to coast			2
several @entity35 lawmakers charged the rule was an example of unwieldy government regulation			1
and scribes even gave the debacle a name : " @entity42			0
" a hotel industry association said the government originally indicated portable lifts were acceptable , but reversed itself in a legal interpretation released early this year			1
it also said the government is requiring a separate lift for every pool , greatly increasing the costs to facilities with numerous pools			1
permanent lifts are costly because they must have electrical grounding work , which requires installers to " tear up " a pool deck , said @entity58 , executive vice president of the @entity59			1
" you have to do electrical grounding requirements anytime you 're within five feet of water , and that 's required by the government			2
and this was not at all contemplated by the @entity8 when they issued this further guidance , " @entity58 said			0
permanent lifts also are an " easy attractive nuisance " for children , she said			2
" children see it , they look at it and say , ' this is a diving board			0
this is something to play with			0
and we 're very concerned about injuries that result from that			0
" @entity58 said portable and permanent lifts range in cost from $ 4,000 to $ 10,000 , but permanent lifts have additional installation costs			1
pool operators said there is also widespread confusion about language in the law that says they must accommodate disabled individuals to the extent that it is " readily achievable " to do so			1
the @entity8 said the " readily achievable " language has been in the @entity91 since 1992 , and is an acknowledgment that it is not always possible to remove all architectural barriers in an existing building at the outset			0
" readily achievable " means that it is " easily accomplished " and can be done " without much difficulty or expense			2
" asked by @entity1 thursday whether the rule requires permanent , " fixed " lifts , a @entity8 spokesman gave the following response : " an existing pool must do what is readily achievable ( affordable and easy )			1
if a fixed lift is affordable and easy for that hotel , they need to provide a fixed lift			0
if only a portable lift is affordable and easy for that hotel , they can use a portable lift			0
if they already have a portable lift , they should explore whether it is affordable and easy to attach the lift			0
if no lift is achievable , they should make a plan to achieve access when it becomes readily achievable for them			2
" that language seemingly gives wide latitude to pool operators			0
but @entity58 says it also creates problems			0
" by having a definition that 's so broad , you really do n't give anybody any certainty , " @entity58 said			0
" which means that you end up having to litigate the definition of what is ' readily achievable			2
' " in a press release thursday , the @entity8 conceded there were " misunderstandings " about the pool law and extended the deadline 60 days			2
it also held open the possibility of even longer delays and said it will accept public comments on a possible six - month extension			1
