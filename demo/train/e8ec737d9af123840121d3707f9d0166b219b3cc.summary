imagine discovering a plant that has the potential to help alleviate post-traumatic stress disorder , suicidal thoughts and paralyzing anxiety			2
that 's what some believe ayahuasca can do , and this psychedelic drink is attracting more and more tourists to the @entity12			1
if you @entity24 " ayahuasca , " you 'll find a litany of stories about @entity17 celebrities espousing its benefits , as well as the dangers of this relatively unstudied substance that triggers hallucinations			2
on this sunday 's episode of " this is life , " @entity26 goes inside an ayahuasca ceremony in @entity28 and talks to the men and women who are drinking this potent brew in hopes that it will alleviate their mental and emotional traumas			1
here are six things to know about ayahuasca , which some call a drug and others call a medicine : former marine lance cpl. @entity43 organizes trips to @entity28 for war veterans , like himself , who are seeking ayahuasca as a possible treatment for ptsd and other emotional and mental trauma suffered after multiple combat deployments			1
he says he 's aware of the risks , as there 's very little known about ayahuasca 's effect on the body , but he says " it 's a calculated risk			2
" " @entity60 is a way to give relief to those who are suffering , " says @entity43 , who says many veterans are not satisfied with the ptsd treatment they receive when they return from combat			1
" it 's just , ' here 's a pill , here 's a @entity68			0
' the ayahuasca medicine is a way to , instead of sweeping your dirt under the rug , you know , these medicines force you to take the rug outside and beat it with a stick until it 's clean , " @entity43 explains			2
" and that 's how i prefer to clean my house			0
" @entity82 , an airman 1st class , is one of the veterans who accompanied @entity84 to @entity28 to try ayahuasca for her ptsd diagnosis , which includes sexual trauma while on active duty			1
she says antidepressants made her more suicidal			2
" i would like to wish not to die all the time , " she said , when asked why she was seeking ayahuasca			2
" i want that to go away " as more ayahuasca centers pop up in the @entity96 , not surprisingly , celebrities including @entity93 and @entity94 have spoken publicly about their experiences with the substance -- albeit illegal outside of religious purposes in the @entity96			2
@entity94 , who has struggled with addiction , called her ayahuasca experience " eye - opening " and " intense			2
" " i saw my whole life in front of me , and i had to let go of past things that i was trying to hold on to that were dark in my life , " she said on her own reality series " @entity105			2
" @entity93 said he and his wife , @entity111 , traveled to a church in the @entity12 where they tried ayahuasca , which the @entity115 singer said made him feel like he was " wired to the entire cosmos			1
" those of have tried ayahuasca say that any benefits -- like with other drugs or medicine -- must be combined with therapy			0
" if you think you 're just going to take ' joy juice ' ... you 're nuts , " explained author and ayahuasca expert @entity123 , who settled in @entity124 , @entity28 , during the first wave of ayahuasca tourism in the 1990s			0
" the five years of work to get rid of [ mental trauma ] is still gon na be on you			1
" @entity123 , author of " @entity60 in @entity131 , " explains that ayahuasca can help " dislodge that negative energy " and show people what their life could be like without the negativity			1
" [ then ] you can go back home and work on getting rid of it			0
" and it used to be taken by only the shaman @entity123 says ayahuasca traditions in the @entity12 have changed since @entity144 tourists began seeking its benefits			1
" traditionally , the shaman drinks [ ayahuasca ] , he accesses other realms of reality to find out where the dissonance is , that if the shaman corrects , will eliminate the [ symptoms ] -- could be physical , could be emotional , could be bad luck , " @entity123 explains			0
" [ then ] we @entity96 come , and we said we insist on drinking the damn stuff -- we want our lives changed and we want that experience , so that certainly set things right on its head			0
" you can even buy ayahuasca powders and extracts online and in the local markets in the @entity168 , but @entity123 warns " you do n't know what it would be			0
" as more and more @entity144 tourists consume ayahuasca , @entity123 says it has him worried			0
" i 've had this feeling in my bones for five or six years that something could go slightly wrong here that could sour a lot of stuff			0
" in april , 19 - year - old @entity181 @entity180 died after taking part in an ayahuasca ceremony in @entity184 , according to various media reports			1
and @entity186 , an 18 - year - old from northern @entity187 , died under similar circumstances in august 2012 in @entity28			0
the shaman who provided @entity186 with the ayahuasca and who initially lied about his death was sentenced to three years in prison , his mother , @entity189 , told @entity0			1
there have been other reported deaths , as well as reports of physical and sexual assaults			0
writer @entity199 says she survived sexual abuse by an ayahuasca shaman			0
" we have to take seriously the potential for harm alongside the huge potential for benefit , " @entity202 says on a video on a fundraising website for the @entity205			0
" standards of safety and ethics would go a long way in making sure that this kind of abuse is n't experienced by anyone else			0
" @entity218 , an @entity96 shaman who leads an ayahuasca healing center in the @entity168 , says he fears there may be more deaths			1
" i hate to say it , yes there probably will be , " he told @entity26			1
" it 's in the cards " through @entity226 , the @entity205 is raising money to create a health guide for ayahuasca centers in the @entity12 , so tourists know which centers are safe and harvesting the plants in a sustainable manner that supports the local communities			1
the idea would be to put the @entity205 's logo outside ayahuasca ceremony sites to signify those centers that meet the council 's criteria for safety and sustainability			1
in addition , there are efforts to study the medicinal benefits of ayahuasca so that it can be regulated and legalized in the @entity96 , explains @entity249 , executive director of the @entity250			0
" at a time when drug policy is being reevaluated , when marijuana looks like it 's on the road toward legalization , when psychedelic medicine is moving forward through the @entity257 and we can envision a time when psychedelics are available as prescription medicines , how ayahuasca should be handled in a regulatory context is really up in the air , " @entity249 said			0
veteran : my search for a @entity268 cure led me to the @entity12			1
