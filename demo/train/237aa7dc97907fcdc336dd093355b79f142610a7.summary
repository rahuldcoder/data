-- is there a smaller , cheaper version of the @entity3 on the way ? rumors abound , but now the @entity6 has found " people familiar with the matter " who have actually laid hands and eyes upon it : " one of the people , who saw a prototype of a new @entity3 several months ago , said the new device is intended to be sold alongside the current line of iphones and would be about half the size of the @entity3			2
the phone , one of its codenames is @entity23 , would be available to mobile carriers at about half the price of @entity27 's main line of @entity28 , the person said			1
" according to the @entity6 , @entity27 's also considering making its @entity30 online storage service free , allowing users to store their data in the cloud rather than on a small device such as an @entity3 , @entity36 or @entity35			1
this move could facilitate a smaller @entity3 , which could store most of its data elsewhere rather than within its tiny confines			0
when will we see such a tiny @entity3 , reportedly one - third smaller than its bigger brother , and costing $ 200 with no contract ? the @entity6 sources are saying this summer , which is right in line with the usual time new iphones are unveiled			0
