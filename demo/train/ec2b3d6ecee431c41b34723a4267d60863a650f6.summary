@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a week where three top surviving leaders of the @entity7 regime stand trial for crimes against humanity , the legacy of that era is still creating upheaval more than 30 years later			1
land ownership is a vague and often contentious issue in a country where the @entity7 destroyed all land records between 1975 and 1979			1
during this period , the regime pushed its utopian @entity19 ideal of an agrarian society forcing thousands from the cities to work in the fields in the countryside			2
an estimated 1.7 million people died during the @entity7 reign			1
twelve years ago , @entity26 bought land around @entity28 -- a big lake in the center of @entity0 , now prized real estate			1
he bought the land from another resident who had claimed the land as their own			2
there was no real transfer of documents			2
@entity26 says he just got a piece of paper after the purchase which served as his record			0
he knew the transaction fell into a gray area , but that 's the way things were done , he said			0
@entity26 built a home and set up a business inside his house fixing mobile phones			0
in september of this year , a developer 's bulldozer knocked down his home , business and livelihood			0
3 top @entity7 leaders go on trial the developer , @entity58 , is owned by a powerful @entity60 senator , @entity59 , who signed a 99 - year lease with the government for the lake property			1
the company has been in the process of filling in the lake and removing residents off the lake property to make way for plans to build luxury apartments and shops			1
the company and the government say the 4000 families -- including @entity26 's family -- who lived around the lake were removed because they were living in a designated development zone			0
@entity2 contacted the senator , who did not respond to requests for comment			0
the developers said they had achieved " a peaceful conclusion " to the dispute			2
not for @entity26 , who has been homeless and protesting at the lake site since his ouster			0
" i want to live here in this same place			0
it 's the place that gave me happiness and security , " @entity26 says			0
the @entity7 regime banned private land ownership			1
when the @entity7 lost power , many @entity60 resettled on plots of land wherever they could and essentially became " squatters			1
" @entity98 and land titles were a distant notion			2
rebuilding lives was the priority			0
in 2001 , @entity1 passed a land law that allowed any @entity60 living peacefully on a piece of land for five years to apply for a land title			1
in 2002 , the @entity106 undertook several land titling projects to help @entity60 obtain legal ownership of their land			1
countries like @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 contributed to these projects which resulted in more than a million land titles being issued			2
but the @entity106 did not follow through on the land titling project around @entity117 and in an inspection report , the @entity106 later admitted to " shortcomings			1
" " the problem is a lot of @entity60 were excluded from the land titling projects if powerful people wanted that land , " says @entity120 of @entity1			1
" they were excluded because in the end , it 's the government itself that issues the land titles			2
" the protestors have made some progress through making noise			0
the @entity106 has suspended loans to @entity1 until the government resolves the situation			1
@entity1 's prime minister got involved and signed a subdecree that allowed several families on 12.44 hectares of land around the lake to remain			1
still , the majority of residents feel this is an injustice that is a long way from being resolved			2
they 've been protesting in front of @entity146 on a regular basis			0
one displaced resident who moved to the relocation site designated by the developer says , " it 's difficult			0
it 's far from the city so it 's hard to do business			0
for this development project , people were forced away like cattle			0

a property dispute of land near central @entity0 pits residents against developers
since the @entity7 regime , property records in @entity1 are *sketchy*
the @entity106 has suspended loans to @entity1 over the land dispute
