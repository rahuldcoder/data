seven years after a disastrous response to @entity1 , the @entity2 is winning praise for how it 's dealing with @entity4			1
" this is the all - new @entity2 , and the leadership is very , very good , very focused , " said dr. @entity5 , a pediatrician and director of the @entity7 at @entity9 's @entity8			1
" they 're doing an excellent job			0
" score one for @entity2 's attempts to come back from its infamous failure after @entity1 struck the @entity16 in august 2005			1
but the @entity18 reviews for @entity2 are n't all moonlight and roses			2
as secretary of homeland security @entity23 -- whose department oversees @entity2 -- is expected to visit the region friday , many survivors in hard - hit places are angry			1
more than three days after the storm , they 're mad about the lack of electricity , lack of information and the lack of gasoline to run generators			0
what 's going on , said @entity2 administrator @entity36 , is part of a priority system			1
search - and - rescue operations take priority over providing assistance , and searches are still going on , @entity36 told @entity44 's @entity43 on thursday night			1
assistance for survivors " is being made , " he said , " but we have n't reached everybody			0
until we do , we 're not stopping			0
" however , @entity2 has " been starting to get emergency fuels in for the generators and for the responders , " @entity36 added			2
in 2005 , @entity2 's slow and disengaged response was a major embarrassment for the @entity54 administration , particularly when top officials admitted they were unaware of thousands of people stranded at a convention center in @entity58 without food and water , days after the storm hit			1
to be fair , the two storms were very different			0
@entity1 hit @entity63 with much more force , and the population of the @entity67 @entity66 eclipses @entity1 's target area			2
after @entity1 , a @entity70 investigation found that @entity2 was shorthanded , failed to commit enough people to prepare for the oncoming storm , did n't have enough supplies in position and had poor communication with state and local authorities			1
its director at the time , @entity78 , had little emergency management experience before being named to the agency 's top job in 2003			1
by contrast , @entity36 came to @entity83 after eight years as emergency management director in @entity85 , where he dealt with several hurricanes			0
one of the @entity88 reforms passed by @entity89 was to require that @entity2 administrator have an experienced chief , said @entity92 , an officer with the @entity93 of the @entity94			1
" it could n't be just a political appointee , " @entity92 said			0
" it had to be somebody who had a practitioner background in emergency management or public safety field			0
it had to be somebody who knew what they were doing before they got into that position			0
" even in the highly charged political environment days before the @entity66 elections , @entity2 has won plaudits from governors of both parties			2
@entity114 's @entity113 -- a @entity115 whose state bore the brunt of the storm -- told @entity119 on tuesday that " cooperation has been great with @entity2 here on the ground , " while @entity124 's @entity123 -- a @entity125 -- told @entity44 that people in his state have been " really , really impressed by the response of @entity2			1
" ' leaning forward ' the agency is now aimed at " leaning forward , " moving supplies like food , water , generators , blankets and cots into an expected disaster zone ahead of time , said @entity92 , the deputy emergency management director in @entity138 , @entity139			1
" before , they would have to wait for a call from a state before they started moving material , " he said			0
they still need a request from a state to distribute those supplies , but " they have things on the ready in a very immediate location			0
" in @entity153 , for example , @entity2 has publicized assistance , including rental payments for those whose homes are uninhabitable			2
individuals can apply for grants for home repairs and to meet disaster - related needs			0
money also is available for construction of a home			0
@entity2 set up online pages for @entity139 , @entity153 and @entity114 storm victims			2
but not everyone is happy with the @entity4 response by governments			2
@entity171 borough president @entity170 said thursday that residents did not receive timely information on how to get food , shelter and tools for putting their lives back together			0
" there was no one there to answer these questions , " @entity170 said			0
" i need answers , and the people need answers			0
" on friday , @entity185 is expected to visit @entity171 with @entity2 deputy administrator @entity186 to meet with state and local officials about response and recovery			1
ten buses stocked with needed goods were transported to the island thursday , and @entity2 has promised to have a team working with @entity170 on the ground friday , he said			2
the 2,200 people @entity2 says it has poured into dealing with @entity4 are about as many as it had on its entire payroll at the time of @entity1			1
the agency also has improved ties with its state and local counterparts as well as other arms of the federal government , said @entity5 , the @entity9 disaster preparedness center director			1
in addition , @entity36 " has been able to attract staff back into the agency , and they have a very competent midlevel management layer to help organize efforts , " @entity5 said			0
" they 're still probably underfunded , but their staffing is much , much better , " he said			0
@entity2 's current budget is about $ 7 billion			1
for @entity4 , the agency said nine task forces were supporting local search - and - rescue operations			1
@entity2 mobile units are providing logistics support for response efforts			2
" community relations teams are on the ground in the hardest - hit areas of the mid-atlantic going door - to - door to inform disaster survivors about available services and resources and to gather situational awareness , " @entity2 said in a statement issued wednesday			2
lessons learned by comparison , at the time of @entity1 , @entity2 had manpower and planning problems and confusion about the roles of officials in responding to disasters , according to a 2006 report by the @entity241 's inspector general			1
the report said that with the destruction of communications infrastructure , it took @entity2 officials about three days after @entity1 's landfall to grasp the magnitude of the hurricane 's destruction			1
the report cited shortcomings with delivering housing and being prepared to conduct a massive search - and - rescue function			1
the @entity1 report , which made 38 recommendations , said @entity2 needed to improve the tracking of supplies			1
the experts said it appears that lessons have been learned			0
@entity92 said @entity36 's philosophy has been that @entity2 " is not the team -- they are part of the team			2
" " that 's one of the biggest things that has come out @entity267 , " he said			0
" there is a cooperative relationship now between local , state and federal agencies to meet the need and fill the gaps			0
" @entity2 's recent performance also won high marks from a former chief , @entity276 , who led the agency during the @entity279 administration			1
" i think the most important thing that @entity2 has already done is to have people in the emergency operation centers , and the prestaged equipment , and following whatever resources the states are going to need to start the process of recovery , " @entity276 told @entity44 's " @entity288			2
" @entity4 hit the @entity114 coastline monday night with 80 mph winds at its center , but it spread destruction across a broad swath of the eastern @entity66			0
the storm smashed beach resorts on the @entity296 and flooded @entity298 subway tunnels , felled trees as far south as @entity300 , dumped heavy snow on the highlands of @entity303 and sent debris flying through the streets of @entity306 .			0

@entity2 chief says search - and - rescue operations taking priority , some fuel being supplied
@entity115 and @entity314 officials praise @entity2 's response to @entity4
the agency 's performance after @entity1 forced reforms
it 's now " leaning forward " and has closer ties with state and local counterparts
