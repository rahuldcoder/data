-- as a little girl , @entity1 was always curious about the @entity3 in her hometown of @entity5 , in @entity6 , @entity7			1
she wondered what happened inside the stone walls of the home for unwed mothers and babies run by the @entity14 sisters of @entity15			2
decades later , as a local historian , she asked the @entity5 registry office for the death records of children at the home from 1925 until its closure in 1961			1
she was horrified at what came back			0
i just could n't believe it , " @entity1 said in an interview with @entity0			2
" 796 names in all			2
and i wanted to know who these children were			2
" that simple act of historical research sparked a nationwide outcry -- and now a government investigation -- into the conditions inside @entity7 's mother - and - baby homes that existed as recently as the 1980s			1
@entity1 ' research raised several disturbing questions , including : how did the children die and what were the conditions inside the home ? and , most important , for @entity1 , where were the children buried ? @entity1 says she asked @entity15 for burial records but was told that none existed			1
she says her efforts to find burial records at local government archives also turned up empty			1
she then cross-referenced the death records with local cemetery records but only found two of the children buried nearby			1
" i can not understand why there is n't a burial record for 796 little precious children , " she said			1
but @entity1 now believes she knows where the children may be buried : on the site of the former @entity5 home , now part of a housing estate			1
all that is left of the home is a crumbling stone wall			2
but in an easily overlooked corner , there is a small walled garden dedicated to " those who are buried here			2
" it 's been known as @entity69 ever since 1975 , when two boys playing in the neighborhood broke open a concrete slab and made a grisly discovery			2
one of them , @entity75 , was 12 - years old			0
" we found a load of skeletons that were clearly that of children			0
" @entity75 told @entity0 , " we were so frightened , we ran out and our parents told us not to go down there			0
the priest came to say a blessing and a few days later it was covered up again			0
and as far as we knew we called it a graveyard since then			0
" @entity1 believes this small plot may be where at least some of the children are buried			1
it was once a disused sewage tank at the edge of the property to the @entity5 home			1
" if the children were not buried there and there are no burial records , " says @entity1 , " then we need to find out : where are they ? " during her research , @entity1 also found a 1947 state inspection report on the home			1
she showed it to @entity0			0
there are several descriptions of " emaciated " children in the report			0
one child is described as so thin that " flesh hanged loosely from limbs			0
" the vast majority of the deaths are under the age of one but children as old as nine are also recorded			0
causes of death included measles , meningitis and whooping cough			0
during the worst years , particularly 1946 and 1947 , several children were dying every month , sometimes even two in one day			0
@entity0 contacted representatives of the sisters of @entity15 and asked them about the conditions inside the home and the children who died			1
in a statement they told @entity0 : " the sisters of @entity15 today said they were shocked and deeply saddened by recent reports about @entity3 , which operated in @entity5 , @entity6 from 1925 to 1961			1
in 1961 the home was closed			0
all records were returned to the local authority , and would now be within the @entity134 , @entity6			0
the @entity135 are committed to engaging with @entity1 , the @entity136 and the local residents as constructively as they can on the graves initiative connected with the site			2
the sisters welcome the recent @entity143 announcement to initiate an investigation , in an effort to establish the full truth of what happened			0
" the @entity5 case is the latest in a string of issues linked to @entity7 's former mother - and - baby homes , funded by the state but run by various religious orders			1
the government has now promised to investigate the many allegations , including forced separations , illegal adoptions , and claims that children were subjected to vaccine trials without parental consent			1
specifically citing the work of @entity1 , the @entity7 government is also considering whether to excavate the possible burial site at @entity5			1
" if this is not handled properly then @entity7 's soul will be , like babies of so many of these mothers , in an unmarked grave , " said @entity7 's prime minister , @entity164			1
@entity1 says she will continue to dig for more records of the home in @entity5 but she does n't necessarily want the site to be excavated			1
more important , she says , is erecting a memorial for the children -- if they are indeed buried there			2
" the least they might have is a name over them , " she told @entity0			0
" those illegitimate children need to be respected as much as any other child born			0
it might bring some justice and maybe healing to those mothers and families			0

the @entity7 government will look into conditions inside @entity7 's mother - and - baby homes
a historian claims @entity5 registry office revealed death records of 796 children at one home
@entity1 says she asked for burial records but was told none existed
but @entity1 now believes she knows where the children may be buried
