-- wednesday 's release of audio recordings of the 911 calls from the @entity4 forced news organizations to make difficult -- and sometimes unpopular -- decisions about what to broadcast and what to hold back			1
news executives said they were considering both the wishes of the community where the school was located -- @entity13 , @entity14 -- and the journalistic impulse to report on one of the biggest news stories of the past year			1
the recordings were made available to news organizations wednesday afternoon			2
@entity0 aired portions of the recordings in a report thursday evening , including a 911 call from the school 's secretary			1
the report was also posted online			0
the network 's report , preceded by anchor @entity28 's warning of disturbing content , also included a call from a teacher who had been shot in the foot and one from a janitor who relayed information between police and dispatchers			0
immediately after the airing , a @entity0 legal analyst said the decision to air the recordings was wrong			1
" other than pure titillation , i do n't see any public interest served by this whatsoever , " @entity42 said			1
one of @entity0 's competitors , @entity47 , also televised some audio clips about an hour after the tapes were released			2
@entity47 anchor @entity50 told viewers the network would " not be airing the most gut - wrenching moments			0
" @entity55 said it would use some audio clips , but would not present all of the material or anything including gunshot sounds			2
@entity60 and @entity61 decided not to broadcast or post any of the recordings , but said they would report on the contents			1
in an internal e-mail to staffers , @entity61 said that " it is fine for all programs and the website to report on the controversy related to the release of the tapes and include quotes or information from the tapes , but without audio			1
" of course , in the digital age , the 911 tapes are accessible to anyone with an internet connection			0
a number of news publishers that linked to the audio , including @entity83 , incorporated warnings that the audio included " disturbing content			0
" many reporters and media analysts said the tapes were inherently newsworthy , but acknowledged that the calls from the school were emotionally wrenching to hear , particularly for people with ties to the shooting			0
one @entity13 official , board of selectmen member @entity95 , said wednesday morning that the release of the tapes " will create a new layer of pain for many in the @entity13 community			1
" @entity13 school shooting 911 calls must be released , judge rules balancing act while often criticized for using 911 tapes to exploit human tragedy , news organizations have an obligation to fight for the release of documents and records that can serve important public ends , such as disclosing improper conduct by authorities or insufficient response to emergencies or other issues , said @entity119 , senior faculty member for broadcast and online journalism at the @entity122 , a journalism think tank			1
@entity119 said wednesday that editors had to listen to the recordings and decide whether the news value was sufficient to warrant using them			2
" the ethical place to be is to listen and to make your decision on two things , " he said			0
" what is your journalism value in using or not using these things , and two , would the good from using them outweigh the harm ? " emergency calls can often prove newsworthy , @entity119 said , as in the case of the @entity144 shooting , in which a struggle and the fatal shot could be heard in the background of one call			0
@entity0 legal analyst @entity147 said wednesday , after @entity0 aired the clips , that he probably would have opted not to use the recordings , but said their release by the judge was the correct decision			1
" i 'm not sure how much this adds to the overall story , but i definitely think this is a decision for journalists to make , not for the government to make , about what gets broadcast and what does n't , " he said			0
@entity4 killer took motive to his grave too much pain ? @entity95 , the @entity13 official , said in a blog post that as they cover the 911 tapes and the first anniversary of the shootings , reporters should " recognize that there is great personal pain in this event and little public good to be garnered through the general release			1
" she continued , " imagine yourself as a parent of a child who was killed , or a family member of one of the six educators			0
imagine yourself as a teacher or staff member in that building desperate to save the lives of children			0
imagine you are the parent of a child who was able to escape			0
then ask yourself , media person , what is the public good and how do i balance that against the hurt ? " nearly a year after @entity4 , nation remains torn about what to do next			2

@entity198 : " i do n't see any public interest served by this , " @entity0 legal analyst says
media outlets faced a balancing act in deciding how to handle the 911 recordings
some , including @entity0 , decided to air portions ; @entity60 and @entity61 declined to air anything
a @entity13 official said wednesday the release " will create a new layer of pain "
