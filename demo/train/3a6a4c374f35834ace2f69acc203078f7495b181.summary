four black bears that died in the @entity4 woods last year overdosed on chocolate bait , wildlife officials said this week			1
a necropsy by the @entity7 showed the bears -- two adult females and two cubs -- died from too much theobromine , a chemical compound in cocoa that 's toxic to animals			2
the bears were found dead in september within 50 feet of where a hunter said he placed 90 pounds of chocolate and doughnuts as bait , officials said			1
@entity22 , wildlife biologist for the @entity24 , and his team presented their findings to the state 's fish and game commission on wednesday			2
it 's an awful way to die , @entity22 said			0
too much theobromine in a bear 's system can cause severe illness , inducing vomiting , hypothermia , seizures , coma , respiratory and heart failure			0
chocolate is popular among commercial bear hunting guides because it 's inexpensive and easy to get , @entity22 said			2
but , given the recent deaths , the practice should end , he says			0
no recommendations have been finalized , but @entity22 says the most effective way to prevent these deaths would be to remove chocolate from the woods			1
the @entity24 does not have rules regarding what foods are best to use as baiting material , but @entity22 says with the new toxicology report on the black bears deaths , the department may look into such regulations			1
the death of these four bears is the largest number of documented black bear deaths related to chocolate consumption that @entity63 is aware of , he said in an interview with @entity1			1
the only other known case was in @entity66 in 2010 , when a black bear cub died after eating chocolate			1
" not all animals that eat chocolate will automatically die , but it is clearly evident that wild animals can consume enough chocolate to reach a lethal dose , " @entity22 said			0
although trapping bears is not allowed in @entity4 , hunters are allowed to bait them			1
hunters will attract bears to a location by using bait and then take a bear with a firearm or a bow , according to @entity22			1
the problem arises when hunters use the chocolate to lure these animals			0
" we have no way to control how much chocolate a bear will consume at a bait site			2
" similar to dogs , the lethalness of chocolate depends on the amount it ingests to reach toxic levels			0
bear baiting is a hotly contested topic , but @entity22 says it is an important tool to help maintain the bear population in @entity4 , which has seen a rise in the past 20 years			2
" we do n't want to allow a bear population where people start to lose appreciation for them and they are seen as pests			0
that is what happened with deer			0
we want bears to be seen in a positive light , " he said			0
bear hunting season runs from september through mid-november and includes a four - week baiting season in september			0
like deer or moose , bears are hunted for their meat			0
there are an estimated 5,700 black bears in @entity4 , an optimal level for the state , officials said			1
bear cub found dead in @entity125 's @entity124			1

four black bears were found dead in the @entity4 woods after a chocolate overdose
a hunter was said to have left about 100 pounds of chocolate out as bait
wildlife experts in @entity4 are looking at possible *ban* with such bait
