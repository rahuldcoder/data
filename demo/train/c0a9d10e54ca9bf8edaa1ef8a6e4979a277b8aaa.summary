-- @entity0 's @entity1 looks ahead to the new season in @entity3 which kicks off on friday august 15			0
@entity5 's @entity4 lifts the @entity7 trophy			1
the veteran keeper has retired aged 39 after many seasons of success			0
the champions @entity5 bounced back in superb style last season after some inspired signings in last summer 's transfer window			1
veteran former coach @entity16 had been inticed back for one final hurrah after @entity5 had suffered the ignominy of failing to reach the @entity18 by finishing only fourth behind @entity19 in the @entity7			1
and @entity16 worked the oracle in spectacular style , bringing in @entity23 wizard @entity22 and @entity25 striker @entity24 to compliment his already talented squad			0
@entity5 cruised to the @entity7 title by 10 points , did the double with victory in the @entity32 final , and only succumbed to eventual winners @entity33 in the semifinals of the @entity35			1
with @entity16 now gone , former @entity5 hero @entity36 has taken up the reigns for his first managerial job in club football			1
the 44 - year - old was a success in leading @entity3 to the semifinals of the @entity43 but it remains to be seen how he copes with the pressure of coaching @entity3 's top club			0
@entity36 has kept his powder dry in the transfer market , with @entity3 midfielder @entity48 the only significant addition , but his squad is so overladen with talent it is difficult to see how it can be improved			0
yet again it appears that @entity5 will be the team to beat			2
the only major change to the side has seen @entity4 's long - time backup @entity57 take over the @entity58 after the retirement of the veteran international keeper			1
the challengers @entity62 pipped @entity63 for second place last season , thanks in part to a potent attack which saw them score 75 goals , seven more than champions @entity5 and 17 more than third highest @entity71			1
@entity62 's strength is their continuity			2
long - serving coach @entity74 is @entity62 through and through -- and has remarkably been at the club since joining as a schoolboy player in 1972			2
he has been coach for nine years and continues to work wonders , keeping the club near the top of the @entity80 year after year -- as well as masterminding their title victory in 2004			0
however , this season , @entity62 must do without @entity84 striker @entity83 , who has left for @entity85 in @entity23 after a legal dispute regarding his kidney condition , and goalscoring midfielder @entity48 , who was snapped up by @entity5			1
@entity90 playmaker @entity89 continues to be the fulcrum of the side , while young striker @entity93 was a regular last season and is tipped to progress further			0
defensive stability is provided by internationals per @entity97 and midfield warhorse @entity98			0
@entity63 continue to be there or thereabouts in @entity3 and have finished in the top three in three of the last four seasons			2
however , they have taken over from @entity106 as the nearly men of @entity109 football , finishing @entity7 runners - up in 2005 and 2007 , @entity32 runners - up in 2005 and @entity105 runners - up in 2007			2
the last of their seven league titles came exactly 50 years ago and new @entity114 coach @entity113 is the man responsible for trying to break that long title drought			0
so far , his dealings in the transfer market have been encouraging and @entity113 has used his knowledge of @entity114 football to enhance the @entity122 club 's squad			0
giant midfielder @entity123 impressed for the @entity114 in @entity124 and @entity63 moved quickly to sign him from @entity125 , while @entity127 striker @entity126 averaged a goal every other game in his four seasons with @entity131 and will add more potency to an attack that already boasts @entity109 internationals @entity135 and the long - serving @entity136			2
point to prove @entity36 rode the crest of a wave of national pride in 2006 when he led a young and talented @entity3 squad to the last four of the home @entity43 , falling to eventual champions @entity143 in an epic semifinal encounter			0
that was @entity36 's first and so far only coaching job and he has kept himself out of the limelight since handing over the national team 's reigns to @entity150			0
a showman on the pitch , @entity36 is deep thinking and private off it and resisted very public overtures from both @entity155 and the @entity157 national team while taking a break from the game			0
@entity161 clubs @entity160 and @entity162 were also rumored to have been keen on recruiting @entity36 , but eventually the lure of coaching the biggest club side in @entity109 football proved too great			0
with success in the @entity7 expected , @entity36 's remit will be to bring @entity18 glory back to @entity169 for the first time since 2001 ; anything less might see the former @entity5 hero under immediate pressure to keep his job			1
new boys two of @entity109 football 's most famous names are back in the @entity7 as @entity179 and @entity180 make welcome returns to the top flight alongside fellow - new boys @entity184			1
five - times champions ' @entity185 were exiled for just one season , winning the second division by six points just one season after their relegation			2
one of the biggest clubs in @entity3 , ' @entity185 command impressive support and @entity114 coach @entity193 will be expected to keep them up this season			0
veteran striker and captain @entity198 continues to be their star attraction and his impressive displays last season ensured he kept his place in the @entity109 national squad for @entity124 , despite playing outside the @entity7			2
@entity180 are back in the top flight after a two - season absence and despite becoming a yo - yo club over the last 10 years , hopes are high that they can remain in the @entity7 under experienced , but controversial , coach @entity210 -- who is in his second spell in charge			1
experienced defenders @entity214 ( @entity215 ) and @entity216 ( @entity217 ) have been drafted in but goals could be a problem following the loss of influential @entity109 striker and former club captain @entity222 to @entity106			0
ambitious @entity184 have made rapid progress through the @entity109 football pyramid in recent seasons and have reached the @entity7 for the first time in their history after just one season in the second division			1
they will begin the season at @entity232 in @entity233 before their own 30,000 @entity234 is completed early next year			0
in @entity236 they certainly have a coach with a wealth of experience			0
the 50 - year - old has coached @entity19 and @entity63 in the top flight and despite his squad 's lack of experience at this level , they will be organized and disciplined under @entity236			1
hello no team has been busier in the transfer market than ambitious @entity71 and @entity250 's side are aiming to build on their superb fifth - place last season			2
the most eye - catching of their new signings has been @entity25 defender @entity255			0
the 26 - year - old cost @entity71 $ 12.4 million from @entity257 and becomes the second current @entity25 international , after @entity24 , to ply his trade in the @entity7			1
@entity255 played a key role in @entity143 's @entity124 squad and his signing is a real statement of intent as @entity71 aim for a @entity18 place this season			2
goalkeeper @entity267 returns to the @entity7 from @entity268 to join @entity19 after the @entity161 side chose not to renew his contract			1
eccentric and unpredictable , the 38 - year - old continues to have the support of national coach @entity150 and he played in all six games as @entity3 reached the final of @entity124 , losing to @entity276			0
goodbye as one veteran goalkeeper returns to the @entity7 , another says goodbye with @entity5 and national team legend @entity4 choosing to hang up his gloves			1
over the last four years , @entity267 and @entity4 were involved in a public and often bitter battle for the @entity283 position in the national team , with then coach @entity36 so undecided about who to select , that he would alternate between the pair from match to match			1
now , aged 39 , @entity4 has decided to call it a day , after nearly 450 first team matches for @entity5 in 14 years -- as well as 86 matches for his country			1
eight @entity7 titles , six @entity109 cups , six @entity294 , a @entity18 winners medal , a @entity35 winners medal , a @entity298 winners medal and a @entity43 runners - up medal show how glittering @entity4 's career was and it will be a long time before another player matches his medal haul for both club and country .			1

@entity306 returns to football to manage champions @entity5
@entity62 , @entity63 , @entity71 likely to challenge @entity5 this season
legendary keeper @entity4 retires , while @entity267 back with @entity19
@entity179 , @entity180 back in top flight ; @entity184 new to @entity7
