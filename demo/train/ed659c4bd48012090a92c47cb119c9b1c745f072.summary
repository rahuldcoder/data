-- the immediate future of the @entity3 's showpiece event was confirmed on wednesday , and that news was quickly followed by proof that men 's tennis has another classic rivalry to savor			0
@entity9 and @entity10 are longtime friends , but their on - court clashes are showing all the hallmarks of following @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 in the annals of modern greats			1
@entity10 may have had the better of their meetings at the @entity22 and the @entity23 , but @entity9 hit back in @entity24 and now the @entity25 has a 9 - 7 career advantage after another tight tussle in @entity28			1
the @entity31 capital 's hosting of the @entity32 has been confirmed for the next three years , ending fears that it would move because of top players ' unhappiness over the country 's tax laws for top earners			1
@entity10 and @entity9 make winning starts at @entity3 finals @entity9 won the season - ending tournament in 2008 , its last year in @entity24 , but has not reached the final since			1
last year he did n't even make it out of the group stage , fading with fatigue after a breakthrough 12 months that he ended as world no. 1 , but wednesday 's 4 - 6 6 - 3 7 - 5 win in more than two and half hours was his second in a row this week			1
it was a match that see - sawed either way , leaving world no. 3 @entity10 needing to win his third and final match against @entity57 on friday if he is to progress in the elite eight - man event			1
@entity57 also has a win and a loss after being beaten 7 - 5 3 - 6 6 - 1 by @entity61 in wednesday 's late match			1
" it was another great match , another great performance from both of us			2
i hope that people who watched it agree with my opinion , " said @entity9 , who plays his final match against sixth - ranked @entity70			1
" i did n't expect anything less other than a tough match that went down the wire and was decided on the last point			2
" it was the sort of match that has helped bring in 250,000 people each year to @entity28 's @entity81			1
" this week we look forward to welcoming our one millionth fan through the gates since 2009 , " @entity3 chief executive @entity82 said after announcing the extension of the tournament 's sponsorship deal with banking group @entity86			2
" we thank every one of these passionate tennis fans for helping to create the electrifying atmosphere at @entity92 , which has offered a spectacular stage for our biggest event			0
" while the tournament , which attracted a television audience of 70 million viewers in 184 countries last year , does not have the prestige of the sport 's four grand slams , the stakes are high -- the prize purse increased to $ 5.5 million this year and will climb to $ 6.5 million by 2014			0
@entity10 cut a forlorn figure last year when he pulled out after his opening match due to injury , but this season he has won his first grand slam under the tutelage of @entity109 -- a five - time winner of the @entity3 showpiece			1
" in about the last two minutes of the match probably is what decided it , " the @entity112 said of his latest clash with @entity9			1
" he broke from 15 - 40 and then i had 15 - 40 in the next game and did n't break			0
" i think both of us probably see each other 's games pretty well			0
especially this year , because we 've played so much			0
you kind of know a little bit what to expect			0
" i think that 's why all the matches , especially the last few , have been so close and decided by a few points			0
the intensity of my matches with him have been extremely high this year			0
" i think both of us probably have seen things in each other 's games improve and that 's why there 's a lot of long rallies and the matches are incredibly tight			0
" they both have some way to go before matching @entity141 , who has won the tournament a record six times and on wednesday was named the @entity3 's most popular player by fans for the 10th year in a row			0
the 31 - year - old , who conceded the year - end @entity148 ranking to @entity9 when he decided against defending his @entity150 title last week , also won the @entity3 's top sportsmanship award -- voted for by his peers -- for the eighth time in his career			2
" we have great matches all over the world , and the recognition is a great feeling			0
we 're trying to inspire the next generation , " said the 17 - time grand slam champion , who beat @entity161 in his opening round - robin match on tuesday .			2
