@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 glimpse the sprawling hotel from a distance , nestled into the lush hills on the outskirts of @entity0			1
the air is fresher here , the temperature several degrees cooler than the sprawling metropolis of more than 30 million people below			2
in its heyday this was a high - end resort area but as we drive along the windy road towards it , i can see it is well past its prime			2
there are rundown buildings , dogs sprawl on the concrete and the smattering of restaurants , massage centers and karaoke bars clearly have n't had a facelift in decades			2
last november , @entity31 , a @entity32 businessman with seemingly rare access to the rich and powerful in @entity1 , took this same journey			1
his body was found in the @entity36 , now the scene of a murder investigation			1
@entity1 enters internet ' battlefield ' over @entity41 @entity31 is at the center of one of the most extraordinary , mysterious and scandalous stories in recent @entity1 history			1
his death is the vital link in a chain of events that has seen a man once touted as a potential president of @entity1 purged from the @entity54 leadership , his wife investigated for murder , and his deputy in custody after he sought asylum at a @entity60 consulate			1
and it all started here , in this grimy , dilapidated hotel ; a hotel my crew and i have now checked into			1
other tv crews have been turned away at the gate , the traditional hand over the camera shot , but we 've managed to find rooms			2
with key in hand i 'm walking in the footsteps of @entity31			1
@entity1 promises thorough investigation into @entity41 scandal it is a musty hotel corridor			1
there is a stale smell of damp carpet mixed with years of stale cigarette smoke			2
it 's hardly the type of salubrious establishment befitting @entity31 's high flying image			1
when i open the door -- the lock itself was jammed and took several tries -- the room is hardly an improvement			2
the furnishings are old and chipped -- a faded , flimsy lounge and a double bed with a garish purple and white vinyl bed head			2
there is a bug fighting for its life on the floor , skirting boards are busted and power points dislodged from the walls with exposed electrical wires			2
the air conditioning switch is old and faded yellow			0
when i switch it on the fan splutters before rattling to life			0
this is a hotel that has seen better days			1
the only decorations here are faded plastic flowers , and appropriately for this story , a jigsaw puzzle on the wall			0
at night mini-skirted call girls can be seen in the corridors furtively knocking on doors			0
i am reminded over and over again of how this seems such an unlikely setting for a baffling story that has captivated the country and thrown open the secretive doors of the all - powerful party			0
patrol cars parked in the driveway , plain clothed investigators moving around the grounds			0
oh to be a fly on the wall in the hotel staff rooms here , but publicly they will say nothing			1
over lunch we tempt waitresses for any morsel of information , but they are well versed in keeping their mouths shut			0
" there are lots of police here , what 's happening ? " we ask			1
they 're just having lunch , " one waitress replies before scurrying off the moment our plates hit the table			0
yet behind closed doors this is all anyone is talking about			0
with each passing day more details are emerging of @entity31 's business and personal links to one of @entity1 's most powerful families , and how it all allegedly went terribly wrong			1
@entity162 was the @entity54 chief of @entity0 , a man who ruled this city with an iron fist			1
he made his name by driving out criminal gangs , sending underground heavies to jail			0
he presided over strong economic growth and did it all to a soundtrack of communist revolutionary - era songs broadcast on local television			0
to many locals , especially the poor we have spoken too , he was a hero			0
one shoe - shine lady told me he made the streets safer and the city greener			0
but to his critics he was an ambitious authoritarian who used his crime - busting campaign to target enemies and rivals			1
now he 's in disgrace , stripped of his titles and hidden from view			1
his former top cop and right - hand man , @entity192 , split from @entity41 and sought refuge in an @entity194			0
sources in the party now claim he 'd argued with @entity41 after raising suspicions the @entity199 ' wife had a hand in @entity31 's death			1
the investigation has yet to reveal its findings , but multiple diplomatic , business and political sources talk of @entity31 's business and personal dealings with the @entity208			1
all the major players are dead or silenced			0
dozens of people connected with the case have been arrested and @entity213 , @entity41 's wife , is under investigation for murder			1
i finally get one local man to talk			0
he does n't condemn @entity41			0
" he should be remembered for the good things he did , " he says			0
but like everyone he is fascinated by the twists and turns of this case			0
" @entity162 is under investigation in @entity227 , " he says , " @entity213 is his wife , she 's involved in the death of that @entity32 man @entity31 , " he tells me excitedly			1
as we walk the grounds of the hotel we get even closer to where it all began			2
@entity31 was staying in what has been described as an upmarket villa in the complex			1
it has a price tag of $ 700 a night			0
if so it is greatly inflated			0
no one will say which exact villa it was and there is tight security , but we do manage to get inside one of the dozen or so two - story units attached to the hotel			2
inside it is as tired and dated as the standard rooms -- the same faded furniture and stains on the walls			0
yet the very state of this hotel , the sleaziness if you like , only lends to the fascination			2
what happened on the night @entity31 died ? what will this mean for @entity41 and his family ? right now the answers to these questions are locked behind these walls and we can only peer through the windows .			1
