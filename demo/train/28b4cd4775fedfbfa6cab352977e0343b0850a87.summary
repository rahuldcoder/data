@entity0 , @entity1 -- five days ago , @entity3 huddled in a science classroom at @entity5			1
she should have been filed with pride , relief and excitement about her upcoming graduation			1
instead , she was filled with fear as a devastating tornado powered through her central @entity12			2
the 18 - year - old has been literally picking up the pieces of her life since			0
her house was unrecognizable , except for her and her mother 's cars , after the twister destroyed it monday			2
her family sifted through rubble and salvaged some things , only to see many of them -- such as her prized book collection -- ruined by torrential rains			0
@entity3 does n't want to live in @entity0 , wary of a place that 's been hit by two ef5 tornadoes -- the strongest possible -- over the past 14 years			1
there 's been plenty of time , and way too many reasons , for tears			2
but finally ... finally , saturday was a time to smile			2
" my family is all here , we get to be together , " @entity3 said about her graduation at @entity12 's @entity35			1
" ( you can ) relax and let your hair down , because you know that we 're not going back to the house today			0
we 're not going to see that			0
" @entity5 's seniors were one of three classes celebrating their commencement ceremonies at the facility			1

a tornado bearing down ; a mom in labor @entity56 is glad the show went on			1
like @entity3 , he 's a @entity5 senior ; like her , he no longer has a place to call home			2
the hours since monday have been " overwhelming , " @entity56 admitted , though he said the outpouring of support -- offers to bunk early at @entity62 where he 'll head this fall , dozens of text messages and " calls out of the wazoo " with offers of help -- have made a big difference			0
he knows people who lost family members , and many more who lost homes			2
he knows that they need time to plan and attend funerals , to clean up debris , to figure out what happens next			2
even with all that , " i 'm glad it 's today , " @entity56 said			2
" it means to me that we 're not going on different routes			0
" we 're staying on the same path that we were meant to be on			0
" one block , two tornadoes : life in the crosshairs graduation festivities were infused by the tragedy , including speakers ' remarks and other poignant reminders			0
one happened when @entity93 's @entity92 walked across the stage to get her diploma and about a dozen people in the crowd stood up and held up pictures of her mother @entity99 , who died in a @entity100 ravaged by the powerful winds			1
outside the convention center , the seniors from @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity0 high schools wo n't have to go far to be reminded of the devastation			1
funeral homes and churches are busy with services for those killed			0
a balm after the storm ten of those killed were children , including seven second - and third - graders at @entity117			0
after three funerals earlier in the week , two more of those students were to be buried saturday			0
transforming @entity0 back into the city it had been wo n't be easy			1
its public schools alone suffered $ 45 million in damage , including the two elementary schools that were leveled			0
insurance claims related to monday 's storm will likely top $ 2 billion , according to @entity128 from the @entity129			0
but residents are n't doing it all alone			0
honest advice from @entity133 to @entity0 besides the presence of @entity137 representatives and other public officials on the ground , they 've had friends , relatives , even strangers come out to help			1
@entity143 has spent the last 25 years teaching math at @entity145 , from which she 's retiring after 40 years total in the profession			0
on friday , a day before her school 's graduation , a caravan of students arrived at her home to clean up her 3 - acre property			1
" it looked like a wall of students with trash cans and trash sacks , and they literally picked up every stick within that three acres there , " @entity143 said			0
principals recall day tornado hit that kind of help makes it easier for @entity0 's residents to move on from this horrific week			1
saturday 's graduation ceremonies are similar , in that way			1
it means the end of one thing , and the beginning of another			0
" it 's just the closing of one chapter and the opening of another , " @entity56 said			1
" ... it 's one of those flipping of the pages that means a lot to everybody here			1
