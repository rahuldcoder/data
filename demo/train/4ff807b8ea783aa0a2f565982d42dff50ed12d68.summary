@entity0 it took less than six hours for a terror attack in @entity4 to trigger a budget fight in @entity0			1
republicans had seen an upcoming battle over funding for the @entity9 -- which , in addition to its anti-terrorism duties , also enforces immigration laws -- as an opportunity to force a confrontation with president @entity15 over his move to limit deportations			1
@entity19 leaders are set to unveil the bill re-igniting that fight friday			0
sen. @entity21 , @entity23 - @entity22 , told @entity1 after the @entity4 attack wednesday that the party should rethink those plans -- or at least make sure they 're narrowly tailored			1
" i hope that we could challenge the executive action of the president in a mature fashion , " he said			0
" i 've never been for shutting down @entity9			2
" the @entity9 's funding is due to expire feb. 27 -- a date chosen by @entity6 in december , as they hashed out a deal to keep the rest of the government up and running through much of 2015 , specifically to force @entity15 into a confrontation over immigration			1
homeland security secretary @entity38 said wednesday that the department needs to be funded through an appropriations bill -- not the sort of continuing resolution @entity43 has used in recent years to keep agencies afloat			1
@entity38 : @entity4 attack sign of ' evolving nature of the terrorist threat ' he said right now , priorities like the @entity49 , the @entity50 , border security efforts and pay increases for the agency 's employees are all being shorted			1
" we ca n't continue to function through a continuing resolution			0
that poses a real risk to homeland security , " he said in an interview with @entity1			1
speaking with @entity1 's @entity63 wednesday night , @entity38 added that the fight over @entity15 's executive action on immigration that has bogged down @entity9 funding in political controversy " does n't really make any sense , " because it 's impossible to defund the action @entity15 took to delay deportations and prioritize searches at the border			1
the president has said he 'd veto any @entity9 funding bill that attempted to roll back his immigration move , @entity38 said , and he urged lawmakers against " playing political football with the budget of the homeland security capability of this nation			1
" " there are things that need to be funded -- new starts , new funding for border security , counterterrorism , the @entity49 , that can not wait much longer , " @entity38 said			1
" for the homeland security of this nation , we need an appropriations bill and we need it soon , " he added			2
he also said had spoken that morning to @entity94 chairman @entity93 , a @entity6 , about his concerns and expressed confidence they would finally come to an agreement on funding the department			2
" [ @entity93 ] shares my concern , " he said			0
sen. @entity101 , @entity102 , agreed with @entity21 , telling @entity1 : " i think we have to rifle shot these things , rather than meat axe			0
and so , we 'll be talking about best ways to address it without shutting down the government			0
" @entity15 , @entity110 condemn terror attack in @entity112 , vow to help rep. @entity113 , meanwhile , said the @entity4 attack should be a " wake - up call , " and warned conservatives to make sure they do n't harm the department 's broader functions			1
" if they want to target immigration to retaliate against the president , that 's fine , " the @entity119 @entity6 told reporters on the hill			0
" but we have to make it clear that @entity9 -- at a time we saw this massive attack in @entity4 -- that we ca n't be cutting funding or programs which would protect @entity130 from a terrorist attack			1
" tying the two issues together brings the risk that @entity6 could be blamed if the department shuts down -- either because @entity43 ca n't agree on a way to fund it , or because @entity15 vetoes a bill that does n't pay for @entity9 's immigration - related functions			1
even some strident conservatives said they needed to avoid being seen as putting funding for the entire department at risk			2
" i believe we should fully fund @entity9 and at the same time prevent the president from violating the constitution , " said sen. @entity142 , @entity143			0
the @entity6 took majority control of both the @entity19 and @entity147 on tuesday , giving them extra leverage to try to undo @entity15 's executive action , potentially through the homeland security funding bill			1
house speaker @entity151 , @entity152 , said wednesday that those plans have n't changed			0
" there are terrorists around the world who are intent on killing @entity130 and other freedom loving individuals around the country			0
i believe that the president 's executive action with regard to immigration are outside of the @entity164 and outside of his power and i believe that we can deal with that issue in the @entity9 bill without jeopardizing the security of our country			2
" @entity172 chairman @entity171 said the terror attacks will not alter the @entity6 ' plans on the @entity9 bill , which he said they will introduce on friday and vote on it early next week			2
when the fight over the president 's executive actions started last fall , @entity171 and others argued that the agency tasked with carrying out the new policy could n't be stripped of money by @entity43 because it is set up to self - fund operations through fees it collects			0
@entity171 told reporters " the only way to get at the use of these fees would be to change the basic law " but said no decisions were final yet about the details of the bill			0
conservative @entity6 rep. @entity197 said he thinks spending bill still needs to target agencies dealing with immigration -- it can crafted in " in such a way that it really hits the accounts			0
" " this is not a seminal moment			0
we know that terrorism is going to happen in the future and we need to be prepared for it , " @entity197 said , but blamed the president for mixing immigration fight with security issues by taking his executive action			2
@entity1 's @entity213 and @entity214 contributed to this report .			0
