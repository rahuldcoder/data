-- after a severe earthquake centered in @entity8 's @entity7 province killed more than 70,000 people in 2005 , teams from a nonprofit architecture group based in @entity3 , @entity4 , helped the region start to rebuild			1
the group , @entity12 25 , worked with local craftspeople to develop a design that could withstand earthquakes and trained them to build the structures			1
that experience may provide some lessons for the rebuilding of @entity21 , where @entity22 is also planning to help with reconstruction , according to @entity24 , an architect who is the organization 's director of projects			1
as in @entity21 , at least some of the death and injury in @entity8 stemmed from local building methods			1
" the important point is that it is n't generally earthquakes that kill people , " @entity24 said			1
" it 's generally buildings that kill people			0
building design is a way to solve that problem			1
" in @entity8 , @entity22 worked with local craftspeople to determine the best way to build structures that could withstand quakes and then helped train people to build them			1
" by the time we built 80 to 100 buildings and we pulled out , we were leaving not just buildings , but also a capacity to build , " @entity24 said			1
" each building we built there was the site of a training exercise for a team of workers -- concrete workers , carpenters , roofers , plasterers , " said @entity24			1
" they have obviously been able to take these skills away			0
in the long run the idea was that we would do ourselves out of a job			0
" @entity24 spoke to @entity0 on january 29			1
@entity0 : what is the role of architects in planning the rebuilding of @entity21 , based on your experience in @entity8 ? @entity24 : at this point , the focus is rightly on relief , and the provision of water , food and medical care , the basic life support system			1
... what we wo n't be doing is clogging up that quite strained delivery system with the bricks and mortar of longer - term reconstruction			2
but there is going to come a point very shortly when minds need to turn to longer - term construction planning , and that 's where architects and engineers have a role to play			2
our work in @entity8 began quite soon after the earthquake			1
but the important factor is that it 's still ongoing , that we need to be there for the long run			0
... what we were doing there was working with local @entity96 [ non-governmental organizations ] , particularly with @entity97 , to identify the most vulnerable members of the community who could most benefit from our architectural and design skills , and could n't afford to buy in their own construction expertise , and would be most marginalized and vulnerable in the future			1
so we worked with @entity97 to develop a series of earthquake - resistant buildings which could then be delivered on a range of different sites			1
we put people in the field to provide quality assurance , to make sure that the buildings that were built would be earthquake - resistant			1
after a disaster there 's an enormous demand for reconstruction , a demand for materials , designers , particularly builders -- so they will tend to be drawn very rapidly into high - value commercial work , which could leave less financially strong people without access to building skills			2
that could lead to them building in a poor and unsafe way , so you get into a very dangerous cycle of vulnerability			2
by building the capacity of local work teams to build , you enable people to build for themselves and break that cycle of vulnerability			2
@entity0 : what kind of buildings did you build ? cross : we were intent on providing an earthquake - resistant home design			1
... the buildings are a lightweight frame construction , which means they are able to flex in the event of an earthquake			2
we adopted the dhaji dewari technique , an indigenous technique developed out of the materials in that landscape			0
we adapted it and improved its details to make it more earthquake - resistant			1
... @entity0 : how much do these houses cost ? cross : approximately Â£ 4,000 [ about $ 6,300 at current rates ] per house			2
that compares very well with the equivalent house in concrete block , which would normally be used			0
it is n't just safer than a concrete - block equivalent but it 's also more economical and it 's quicker to deliver			0
@entity0 : what 's it made of ? cross : it 's made of lightweight timber frame with many cross-facing elements , and the gaps between cross-facing elements are infilled with stones and mud and then rendered over with mud			0
what that generates is a design which flexes when the earthquake strikes , the energy of the earthquake is dissipated through the many framing elements of the building , and the energy is lost in the friction between the timber and the stone infill			1
... a concrete - block building which is n't able to flex is more apt to collapse			2
... the other thing that 's worth mentioning is that the buildings have a lightweight roof			0
in the worst eventuality , if the roof collapses , if it 's lightweight , it 's much less likely to kill people			0
... @entity0 : what similarities are there between the building styles in @entity8 and @entity21 ? cross : i have n't yet been to @entity21 , and we 'll be undertaking our first visit as soon as conditions really allow that to happen , which i think will be in february or early march			1
but what i think we will find is that there will be an equivalent vernacular tradition in @entity21 from which we can learn a lot			0
i 'm sure the problem that we saw in @entity8 is shared in @entity21 -- in that concrete buildings have been built poorly , without adequate technical supervision , and have proved very vulnerable to the earthquake			1
a good architect will never decide at a distance what the right technical approach would be , because it 's always important to understand the location			0
... so when we go to @entity21 , the first thing we will do will be to carry out participation workshops with the local communities , to carry out a needs assessment but also a skills assessment ... so we design the right buildings , appropriate to the materials available and the skills that are present			0
@entity0 : it 's still early , but how do you assess the need in @entity21 compared to the need in @entity8 ? cross : all of the information we have at the moment suggests that the need is even greater in @entity21			2
in @entity8 , the earthquake did enormous damage , but there was still a strong national government , relatively strong local government and a strong military presence in the @entity8 army with which we could collaborate			1
in @entity21 those institutions were already weak and in many cases have been destroyed by the earthquake			0
the partnerships which we would look to build with local governments may be much harder			0
... there 's likely to be an even greater role for strong strategic planning and long - term thinking from architects			0
... i should say that you should never see @entity21 as a blank slate			0
you look at the images , you think the damage is so great , it 's a clean sweep -- but you should never see it as a blank canvas on which to impose a master plan from @entity3 or @entity258			2
there remains in @entity21 a social infrastructure , an economic infrastructure , even in the slum areas there 's an economically vibrant infrastructure			0
it 's those threads of the community infrastructure that we need to find and build a new @entity21 around			0
so all of our work starts with community participation and is part of empowering the local community and making sure that what we design is compatible with their objectives			0
... one of the big problems immediately after this kind of disaster is the lack of long - term investment			0
the funding for short - term relief is good and is needed , but very often at the point of about a year , that funding just falls off a cliff			2
that 's what i 'm hoping will be improved on in the @entity21 response .			0

earthquake centered in @entity7 of @entity8 killed more than 70,000 in 2005
@entity3 - based nonprofit provided architectural help to start rebuilding
@entity24 says lightweight framing was used to build earthquake - resistant houses
he says good building design can lessen the toll of an earthquake
