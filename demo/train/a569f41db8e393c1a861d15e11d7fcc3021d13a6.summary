-- four days after a @entity3 civilian - operated cargo jet plunged into the ground shortly after takeoff from @entity6 in @entity7 , killing all seven people aboard , one expert said that a number of factors likely were involved in the incident			2
" accidents , of which this was among the worst that i 've ever seen , are typically a confluence of circumstances of seemingly unrelated events , which all coalesce to create a disaster , " said @entity12 , a pilot , engineer and partner in the @entity16 - based law firm , @entity15			1
the doomed plane 's final moments appear to have been captured by a dashboard camera inside a vehicle on the base			1
the approximately three - minute video shows what appears to be the @entity32 jet starting its climb at 11:20 a.m. local time monday from the base			1
@entity32 , the parent of @entity32 , said the flight had refueled at @entity6 en route from @entity39 , a @entity40 military base in @entity7 , to @entity41 in the @entity42			1
@entity32 said the aircraft had landed uneventfully in @entity6 and no additional cargo or people were taken on there , it said			1
prior to departure , the cargo was reinspected , it added			0
" the cargo contained within the aircraft was properly loaded and secured , and had passed all necessary inspections prior to departing @entity39 , " the company said in a statement posted on its website			1
it identified the crew members as two pilots , two first officers , a loadmaster and two people involved in maintenance			0
@entity3 military plane crashes in @entity64 the pilots were likely doing a " maximum performance takeoff " in an attempt to climb to altitude as quickly as possible , thereby limiting exposure to any attempts to shoot it down , @entity12 said friday , citing the jet 's pitch attitude , which he said appeared higher than normal			1
@entity32 , which specializes in moving freight for the military and businesses , did not immediately return a call asking about whether the pilots had , in fact , performed such a takeoff			1
about 12 seconds into the video , the @entity80 appears to stall , rolls from side to side , and drops			1
at 23 seconds , the plane crashes nose first into the ground off the side of the road , erupting into a ball of orange flame and black smoke			1
@entity0 can not confirm the video 's authenticity			1
it bears the date 2013/02/01 , but date stamps can easily be inaccurate			0
the cargo aboard ill - fated @entity96 included five mine - resistant , ambush - protected vehicles that were being taken out of @entity7 as part of the drawdown of @entity3 forces , said @entity101 of @entity32			1
mraps can weigh 12 tons to 24 tons apiece , depending on the model , according to a 2011 @entity105 report			0
that would mean the @entity107 had a total weight of at least 60 tons , which is within the jet 's specifications , according to @entity111			0
if the takeoff had been rougher than usual , " it could have caused the cargo in the back of the plane to become loose , " @entity12 said			1
if that happened , and the cargo slid to the rear of the plane , it could have left the plane with an improper weight and balance , he said			2
he compared that situation with what happens when a heavy person and a light person get on either end of a seesaw			0
" the light person is never going to get the heavy person off the ground , " he said			0
in the case of cargo that was not properly placed or secured , " you 've got a big , heavy person at the end of the airplane , which outweighs the flight control 's capacity to override that weight			1
" @entity12 's law firm specializes in litigation stemming from plane crashes			2
he does not have direct knowledge from the investigation			0
the critical role of the loadmaster in such flights was outlined in a posting published last month on @entity6 's website			0
" when you are a pilot flying a @entity153 over potentially hostile territory , the last thing you need to worry about is whether your cargo is secure , " it says			2
" that 's why each sortie the 774th @entity158 flies includes two loadmasters			0
" they are responsible for checking all the systems in the rear of the aircraft and overseeing the loading of the cargo , then making sure it stays that way , it says			0
" upon takeoff , we 'll be looking back at the cargo until we get off the ground , making sure none of the chains break or pop out , " airman 1st class @entity169 says in the airfield 's story			0
" if they do , we let the pilots know ... and we taxi back			0
" " there 's a lot of trust that we put in our loadmasters , " said capt. @entity183 , 774th @entity158 aircraft commander , in the same story			0
" they 're pretty autonomous ... making sure the cargo is secure and loaded correctly			2
" other possible contributors to the crash include malfunction of the flaps on the wings , or some other flight - control system or even a massive loss of power , @entity12 said			2
but @entity12 said he considered the last possibility to be the least likely , given the redundancy built into the four - engine jet			0
" it 's a fantastic plane , " he said			2
the video leaves no doubt that , whatever the cause , the plane wound up flying too slow to generate sufficient lift on the wings to keep the airplane aloft , he said			1
" in all my years of being involved in aerospace and piloting and litigation , i have never , ever , ever seen such a dramatic crash sequence as this one , " he said			2
" it really is nauseating to look at , a monster like that falling out of the sky			2
that 's not supposed to happen			0
" @entity12 predicted that the cockpit voice recorder and digital data recorder will provide investigators with the answers to the questions they are asking			0
in its statement , @entity32 said it " will not speculate as to the cause of the accident , " and that it was fully cooperating with authorities as the investigation continues .			1

" it really is nauseating to look at , " pilot says of plane crash video
@entity32 " will not speculate as to the cause of the accident "
military vehicles were " properly loaded and secured , " company says
