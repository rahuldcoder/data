@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the end , @entity3 gave up her short - lived political career after family pressure proved even harder to overcome than official intimidation			1
" my enthusiasm was just extinguished by my @entity14 's tears , " the 21 - year - old elementary school teacher posted early sunday morning on @entity10 , @entity1 's equivalent of @entity11			1
" i decided to call it quits as soon as they announced the initial election result -- sorry if i let anyone down			2
" @entity3 had been running to become a deputy chief of her native @entity20 , a fishing village of some 12,000 residents in southern @entity1 , part of an unprecedented exercise in grassroots democracy in a country where the @entity28 usually reigns supreme			1
some 80 % of the 8,300 registered voters , state media reported , flocked to @entity31 on a balmy saturday to select a new village leadership			0
as red flags fluttered in an early spring breeze and loudspeakers played folk music , villagers marked their choices in booths marked " secret balloting " with election workers and volunteers standing by to answer any questions			0
dozens of foreign reporters -- used to government interference in the field -- savored a rare moment to roam freely , filming the event and interviewing voters , as several officials watched from a second - floor balcony			0
the orderly scene was soon disrupted by the appearance of @entity3 who was besieged by photographers jostling to get a shot of her			2
with her small frame disappearing in a sea of flashing cameras , @entity3 's friends had to rescue her from the press pack			1
the young woman 's celebrity only served as a poignant reminder of the tumultuous period the village had just passed through			1
from september to december 2011 , thousands of locals took to the streets of @entity20 , protesting the illegal seizure of their farmland by corrupt officials , expelling local @entity28 leaders and clashing with anti-riot police who surrounded the village			1
the months - long " siege of @entity20 " culminated when security agents took several protest leaders into custody early december , and one of them -- @entity85 -- soon died in jail			1
authorities blamed sudden illness , but his family and most villagers believed he had been beaten to death			0
as the untimely death became a rallying call , provincial authorities relented and agreed to the protesters ' demands , sacking local officials , launching an investigation into the land dispute , and promising an open and fair village election			1
when @entity2 first met @entity3 , who is @entity85 's daughter , in january , she was still reeling with anger and disbelief after the death of her father			1
her distraught mother could barely speak			0
" @entity111 was like @entity112 to us , " she said at the time , her eyes welling up with tears			0
" how can i just accept that he 's suddenly no longer with us ? " with a maturity beyond her years , @entity3 vowed to get her father 's body back , which had been held by the authorities , confronting every official who visited the family to offer condolences			1
although her father 's body was eventually returned in february , and the family received government compensation of 900,000 yuan ( $ 143,000 ) , @entity3 made it clear she would continue to seek justice for his death			1
lighting incense sticks and kneeling in front of a large portrait , @entity3 paid tribute to her late father at home saturday morning before heading to the polls			2
@entity3 tweeted that she had decided to stand for election at the last minute , defying officials who warned her that she may lose the job that provides the only income for her mother and two younger siblings			1
" the villagers want me to run , " she told @entity2			0
" and i think of my father -- i want to do something for him			0
" she may be the most unlikely candidate on the ballot , but plenty of voters were willing to embrace a daughter carrying on a cause her father died for			2
" we all liked him and are now voting for her , " said @entity156 , a 53 - year - old villager lingering on the school ground after voting			0
" she told us at meetings that she would follow her father 's footstep to help us and look after our welfare			0
" as @entity156 and her fellow villagers exercised their hard - fought democratic right , some analysts have wondered whether the " @entity20 effect " could bring wider political freedoms			1
@entity1 watchers estimate the country saw some 180,000 " mass incidents " in 2010 , most of which occurred in rural areas and were related to land confiscations			2
while the @entity1 central government has permitted direct village elections since the 1980s , critics say the @entity20 election is nothing more than symbolism and that the @entity28 still keeps a tight grip on dissent nationwide , especially in the wake of the @entity186			1
back at @entity31 , @entity156 echoed other local villagers when she said a " fairer " election would n't solve the core issue that triggered the original protest : the sale of almost 1,000 acres of land by local officials to developers without any compensation to farmers			2
" how can we farmers live without our land ? " she said			0
" we want our farmland back and there has n't been much progress			0
without news coverage , our struggle would have died a long time ago			0
" with two prominent protest leaders declared the winners for the top two positions on saturday night , it remains to be seen whether there will be any real change in rural @entity1			2
" a democratic election produces capable village officials who will help villagers get back their seized land and stolen assets -- so it 's a necessary step in the process , " @entity211 , who was elected deputy village chief , told @entity2 before casting his ballot			1
@entity3 failed to get enough votes for an outright victory , but is eligible to compete in a runoff sunday			2
worried that she may meet her father 's fate , some family members had vehemently opposed her political career from the outset			1
as her decision to quit the race spread online , reaction among her 25,000 @entity10 followers appeared mostly encouraging			0
" it does n't matter whether or not you get elected , " one supporter wrote			0
" your family has already paid the ultimate price for @entity20			2
" " do n't blame your grandmother -- she 's been through too much , " another one chimed in			0
" you 're still young and there will be time for another run			0
