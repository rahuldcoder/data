-- the trial of @entity2 , a man accused of raping , killing and dismembering 11 @entity5 - area women between 2007 and 2009 , is scheduled to enter a second day tuesday			1
prosecutors spoke for more than an hour during opening statements monday , detailing each woman @entity2 is charged with killing and describing steps police took to obtain arrest warrants and gather evidence at @entity2 's house			1
pictures were shown to the entire courtroom to further illustrate the scene @entity16 officers and @entity5 police encountered			1
the defense spoke for just a few minutes , stressing that the state of @entity21 has the burden to prove that @entity2 committed the homicides			1
the defense argued that there is no dna , fingerprints or evidence to prove @entity2 committed the killings			1
the defense also focused on @entity2 's character and claimed that he has suffered mentally and physically since a heart attack in 2007 led to the loss of his job			1
after opening statements , the prosecution 's first witness took the stand			1
@entity40 is a member of the swat team that worked with other @entity5 police to arrest @entity2 and gather evidence at his house			1
@entity45 is the officer who found the first two bodies in a small room on the third floor of @entity2 's house			1
@entity2 has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to the 85 counts he faces			1
investigators at @entity2 's home unearthed remains of five of the 11 women -- ages 25 to 52 -- in october 2009			1
since then , other women have come forward alleging that @entity2 attacked them too			1
in april 2010 , prosecutors handed down a 10 - count indictment against @entity2 in connection with the alleged rape of a 34 - year - old woman in his home			1
@entity2 's lawyers have declined previous requests by @entity0 to explain their case , and the suspect has not been interviewed			2
but in january 2010 , attorney @entity70 told @entity72 newspaper in @entity5 that he felt police violated @entity2 's miranda rights as he was being interrogated			2
@entity2 grew up in @entity76 , joined the @entity77 at age 18 , and traveled to @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 , authorities said			2
people who interacted with him after his 2005 release from prison , where he had served 15 years for attempted rape , said he appeared to be " a normal guy , " known locally for selling scrap metal			0
his inconspicuous two - story home sits in a dilapidated neighborhood known as @entity90 , where one in five homes was in foreclosure and at least a third of residents got food stamps , according to a 2010 study by @entity98 's @entity97 and @entity99			0
neighbors and even a city councilman had failed to realize that the stench wafting in the area around @entity2 's home was from human flesh , not a byproduct of a nearby sausage factory			2
moreover , the disappearance of the 11 women -- many of whom lived nearby -- went largely unnoticed for almost two years , with only four of them even being reported missing			0
many of his alleged victims struggled with drug addiction at some point in their lives , with court records showing that many resorted to stealing and prostitution to support their habits			0
in late 2008 , @entity122 told police that a man in a gray hoodie offered her beer , and when she declined , punched her in the face several times			0
@entity128 said that he then tried to rape her , dragging her toward his home , adding that she got out only after " gouging his face			0
" police investigated @entity128 's complaint , with one police report noting blood droplets on @entity2 's walls and steps			2
but officers told @entity0 affiliate @entity139 that the case was dropped after @entity128 declined to press charges			0
after @entity128 's complaint , six more women would disappear			0
then , on september 23 , 2009 , a 36 - year - old @entity5 woman told police a story eerily similar to those of @entity128 and the woman whose 1989 account led to @entity2 's first conviction for attempted rape			2
she said he 'd invited her into his home for beer , punched her in the face , then began performing oral sex on her -- releasing her only after she promised to return the next day			0
more than a month later , police entered his house and found two bodies rotting in his attic			0
these were the first of the 11 bodies they 'd eventually discover , in various states of decay , on his property			0
most of the women whose remains were found in and around @entity2 's home were strangled by ligature -- which can include a string , cord or wire -- and at least one was strangled by hand , officials said			2
seven still had ligatures wrapped around their necks			0
a skull is all that remains of one victim			0
it was found wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed in a bucket in the home 's basement			0
while the prosecution will press its case against @entity2 in the coming weeks , this may not be the end of his story -- even if he is eventually given a death sentence			1
@entity193 prosecutor @entity192 has said that his cold case unit is reviewing unsolved murders that occurred during the time @entity2 lived in @entity5 and @entity76 to see if there are any connections			2
@entity192 said the group is working its way through 75 cases .			0

@entity2 has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity
during opening statements , the prosecution showed pictures of the scene
the defense said there is no evidence to prove @entity2 committed the killings
