@entity0 won an @entity2 for her heart - wrenching performance in " @entity4 , " in which she plays a linguistics professor with early - onset alzheimer 's disease			1
much has been written about her characterization of a woman struggling with the disease			0
but there 's another reason the performance hits home for millions of @entity14 , whether they are grappling with @entity16 's or not			1
the late @entity17 , who co-directed the film with @entity19 , named it : " @entity4 , " he said , is actually a film about " the real unsung heroes : caregivers			1
" as the audience journeys with @entity4 and her family from diagnosis to acceptance and adaptation , we watch her husband and three children struggle to make sense of the changes in @entity4			1
they each adjust in their own way , testing and transforming elements of their relationships			0
and we see what happens when care becomes -- or does n't become -- a central feature of these relationships			2
the changes in these relationships -- between husband and wife , and mother and child -- yield some of the most provocative , brutal and poignant moments of the film			0
the caregiving relationship is never simple , but the " presence of being " it requires always offers an opportunity for raw honesty and transformation -- both for the individuals involved and the relationship itself			0
and , in the film , family members grow to become a crucial , if imperfect , circle of care			1
this story is familiar to more and more @entity14 , young and old			1
like so many families , @entity4 's did not have a plan to address such an unexpected diagnosis and must scramble to create makeshift solutions while navigating their own in - the - moment reactions			1
i recognize their confusion and pain all too well			0
after my grandfather 's vision deteriorated and his health failed in other ways , my father was unable to find him appropriate home - care support			1
he had to place him in a nearby nursing home , against my grandfather 's wishes			2
there he slept in a dark room with half a dozen other people , some completely still , others wailing with pain and suffering			0
it smelled of mold and illness			0
he did n't sleep or eat for days , and passed away just three months later			0
even now , the memory of my visits with him sends a chill down my spine			0
in my new book , " @entity106 , " i explore the experiences of my family , families like @entity4 's , and the millions of people across our nation who are called to care for loved ones in response to chronic illnesses , disabilities or the natural effects of aging			1
most families do n't have a care plan in place , and more importantly , we as a nation do n't have a plan either			2
as a result , so many of us are struggling : we are overwhelmed family caregivers , we often can not afford the long - term care option we need -- if we can even find it -- let alone enjoy the time we have together			1
and we feel alone in this struggle			0
in reality , 4 in 10 adults in @entity14 now care for loved ones , and by 2050 , 27 million @entity14 will need long - term care or assistance , many as a result of a demographic shift i call " the elder boom			1
" as the baby boom generation ages , and health - care and scientific advances extend our life expectancy by nearly 20 years , the very nature of growing older is shifting			2
and polls show that more than 90 % of older @entity14 want to live out their elder years at home			1
the key to addressing this cultural shift is to bravely confront , embrace and place a new value on the caregiving relationship			0
family caregivers such as @entity4 's family members and professional caregivers like @entity140 , who joins @entity4 's care circle later in the film , are critical to our ability to live and age the way we desire , connected to our families and communities until the end			1
in his moving 2013 commencement speech to @entity152 graduates , author @entity149 reflected on the evolution of the human experience			0
" your ' self ' will diminish and you will grow in love , " @entity149 said			0
" you will gradually be replaced by @entity159			0
" with subtlety and realistic grace , the characters of " @entity4 " reveal how the caregiving relationship , while never easy , enhances and amplifies this universally attainable goal			2
and that in the end , we should all strive to be replaced by love , and surrounded by care .			2

@entity170 : " @entity4 " shows a *scenario* familiar to many @entity14 : an ailing family member and no plan for care
she says it 's good *reminder* in our aging *population* of the critical role that caregivers play in allowing us to live with *dignity*
