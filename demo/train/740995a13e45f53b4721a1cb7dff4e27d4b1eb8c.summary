-- it was a remark that launched a media firestorm			1
should it have ? in the midst of praising @entity6 attorney general @entity5 on thursday , president @entity3 described her as " by far the best - looking " ag of all			1
by friday , the uproar over the remark was such that the president called @entity11 to apologize for the " distraction created by the comments , " according to his spokesman , @entity14			1
@entity0 readers were sharply divided over whether such an apology was warranted			2
some drew on their own personal experiences with such incidents			1
@entity20 said that she is often " annoyed " at the focus on women 's appearance that she observes day to day , but that the president did not commit a foul here			1
" it 's a comment you often hear from men to point out that a woman is more pleasant to the eye			1
i do n't see much harm in that especially coming from a man who is surrounded by strong women and clearly has the highest respect for them			2
" @entity38 mentioned how , one day , he was complimented on his " beautiful hair " by a woman in the parking lot of a golf course			2
but you know , it really made a 65 - year - old guy feel pretty good			2
" he said the " politicization " of such remarks would mean " soon we 'll all be just staring dumbly at one another from the fear of saying something wrong			1
" but what about incidents at the workplace ? " consider this : you are at work and you tell your co-worker , ' by the way , you are the best looking co-worker here , ' " said commenter " me not you			1
" " could you be in the @entity62 office by the end of the day ? i think so			2
" commenter " @entity67 " recalled telling a female co-worker that her new haircut brought out her eyes			0
" next thing i know , i hear about how i was being inappropriate and hitting on her , " he explained			0
" when i asked her about it , she said she did n't think i was and in fact she was happy all day long that at least one man noticed it			0
a few weeks later , she complimented my girlfriend about how sweet i am to notice things like that			0
" another commenter , " pmn , " said that she went through a very similar experience to that of @entity11 , being introduced as a new employee			1
" one of the male executives announced that she is definitely good - looking compared to a past employee , " she said			0
i turned completely red and felt very awkward			0
" and " jon " commented that remarks like that are banned from his workplace			1
@entity91 , who stated that he supported the president , found the comment out of line , imagining if the scenario were slightly different			0
" i do n't recall a president commenting on how rugged their vice president looks , specifically because it detracts from the reason they are hired			0
" " really ? " also commented by imagining that the tables had been turned somewhat			0
" what would the response have been if a female politician with tremendous power had remarked that a male politician with less power was the ' best - looking so and so ' ? " they added that ultimately , it comes down to the context and setting			0
" if a comment like this is made between close friends , no big deal -- although the time and place the comment is made could be questioned since others may not know that it is a comment between friends			0
if a comment like this is made between people that are only meeting recently , or for the first time , in this type of forum -- not appropriate at all , regardless of political affiliation and / or position of power			2

commenters weighed in on @entity3 's remark about @entity136 's looks
some drew on personal experience in *deciding* if @entity3 should have apologized
some said such a remark in the workplace would have caused trouble
one says fear of *misspeaking* could leave people " staring dumbly at one another "
