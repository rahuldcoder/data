a @entity1 architect is thinking a little bigger about @entity3 printing than the tiny - to - midsize trinkets we 've seen so far			1
he wants to print a house			0
and a pretty offbeat and innovative one at that			0
" @entity10 " is the brainchild of architect @entity9			1
he describes it as " one surface folded in an endless @entity14 , " or sort of a giant figure 8			1
according to its creator , walking through its continuous looping design will seamlessly merge indoors and outdoors in an effort to model nature itself			2
the house would cost between $ 5 million and $ 6 million , according to the @entity23 , and there 's already been interest expressed by museums , private individuals and others , according to @entity29			1
he told the network that someone in @entity33 plans to buy one to display native art he 's found in a nearby national park			0
all that would be innovative enough on its own			0
but to take it a step further , the architect plans to build " @entity10 " using the emerging technology of @entity3 printing			1
the woman who wants to ' print ' buildings commercially available models like the @entity47 are n't exactly up to the task			0
this requires a printer of enormous size			2
and @entity29 found one in the d - shape			0
described as a " mega-scale free form printer " by its makers , the massive aluminum structure uses sand , which it forms back into a material that 's like marble			0
for " @entity10 , " it will be used to print out blocks that are about 20 feet by 30 feet			1
those , along with some fiberglass and concrete reinforcements , will be used to create the building			2
" 3d printing is amazing , " @entity9 told the @entity23			0
" for me as an architect it 's been a nice way to construct this specific design -- it has no beginning and no end , and with the 3 - d printer we can make it look like that			1
" he says his first " @entity10 " is expected to be completed by the end of 2014 .			2

@entity1 architect to create the first building done with @entity3 printing
" @entity10 " would be a huge figure 8 that lets people seamlessly go in and out
the @entity87 printer will crank out 20 - by - 30 - foot *marblelike* blocks for it
@entity91 is $ 5 million to $ 6 million ; the architect hopes to finish it in 2014
