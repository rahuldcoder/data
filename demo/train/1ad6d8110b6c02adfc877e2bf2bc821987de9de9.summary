@entity0 -- the search for @entity5 , a 6 - year - old @entity0 boy who disappeared more than three decades ago , is expected to resume on monday after being suspended for " operational reasons , " an @entity3 spokesman said			1
a law enforcement source briefed on the investigation said no evidence of human remains has been found so far in the basement of a building in @entity16 's @entity15 neighborhood where investigators are looking			1
around 2 p.m. sunday , investigators searching the basement abruptly folded up a tent they had erected to shield them from a nasty rainstorm			2
moments later , two large @entity24 vans rolled in , obstructing most of the view of the scene			2
through a small break between the vehicles , photographers were able to catch a glimpse of something being loaded into the side of an unmarked blue van			0
@entity3 spokesman @entity35 declined to discuss the reasons behind the search 's suspension			1
" we 'll be back in the morning , " he said			0
sunday 's developments came a day after investigators discovered a possible blood stain on a concrete wall while tearing apart the basement in their search for clues in the case , a second law enforcement source told @entity1			1
@entity3 agents , assisted by the @entity24 , discovered the stain by spraying the chemical luminol , said the second source , who was also briefed on the investigation			1
the chemical can indicate the presence of blood , but is not always conclusive , according to that source			1
at this time , the stain is described only as an area of interest			2
investigators used chainsaws to dig out the portion of the wall with the stain , which will be sent to the @entity3 laboratory in @entity69 , @entity70 for analysis to determine whether the substance is blood and , if so , whose it is , the second law enforcement source said			1
the basement is about a half - block from where the boy 's family still lives			1
@entity79 vanished may 25 , 1979 , as he walked to a bus stop by himself for the first time			1
a carpenter whose former @entity16 basement is the scene of the search said through his lawyer friday that he had no involvement in the disappearance			1
@entity89 , 75 , who has not been charged with a crime , has long cooperated with authorities and plans to continue to do so , his lawyer said			0
" mr. @entity89 has been cooperating with this investigation for over 30 years , " attorney @entity93 said			0
" he has continued to cooperate on multiple occasions			0
and i am going to assist him in cooperating to the fullest extent possible			0
" @entity89 's daughter , @entity98 , told @entity1 affiliate @entity99 that her father had cooperated with federal agents , saying he " does n't have anything to do with it			0
" investigators recently relaunched their probe of the cold case , often described as a milestone effort that helped draw the plight of missing children into the national consciousness			0
missing child case ' awakened @entity111 ' authorities said both new and old information led them to @entity89 , a part - time handyman , who met @entity79 the day before he disappeared and gave him a dollar			1
@entity89 faces no charges in connection with the disappearance			0
it was interest in the carpenter that prompted authorities to bring a cadaver dog about 10 days ago to a @entity15 basement , where @entity79 apparently had encountered the carpenter , then 42 , according to a source with knowledge of the investigation			1
the dog picked up a human scent in the basement , where the man had a workshop			1
when agents interviewed the man about his connection to the basement , the source said the carpenter blurted out , " what if the body was moved ? " @entity93 , the attorney , said he will speak to authorities about that alleged remark			1
" i do n't know that he asked that , " @entity93 told reporters			0
late thursday , authorities set up a grid in the basement and planned to rip up the concrete floor			2
they also took out part of the back wall of the basement , an unoccupied area beneath what was once a restaurant			2
the floor was " newly poured " at the time the boy disappeared , according to another law enforcement source			1
it was not dug up during the original investigation			0
@entity89 was picked up by the @entity3 again thursday , but is not in custody			1
he was questioned and returned to his @entity165 apartment , the source with knowledge of the investigation said			2
" we 're looking for human remains , clothing or other personal effects of @entity5 , " @entity24 deputy commissioner @entity169 said of the current investigation			1
" it 's a very painstaking process			0
" in 2010 , manhattan district attorney @entity176 said his office decided to take another look at the decades - old mystery			2
@entity3 leads were then culled from that case file , sources said			1
the investigation garnered national headlines as authorities splashed the child 's image on the sides of milk cartons in the hopes of gathering more information , then a novel approach			0
@entity79 was officially declared dead in 2001 as part of a civil lawsuit filed by his family against a drifter , @entity196 , a convicted child molester acquainted with his babysitter			0
a judge found @entity200 responsible for the death and ordered him to pay the family $ 2 million			2
he never paid the money			0
though @entity196 has been considered a key focus of the probe for years , he has never been charged in the case			0
he is serving a 20 - year sentence in a @entity209 prison for molesting a different boy and is set to be released later this year			1
a source said investigators want to expand the pool of possible suspects beyond @entity196			2
@entity216 and @entity217 , @entity79 's parents , still live a block away from the scene and would n't comment on the new developments			0
a notice on the apartment building said , " to the hardworking and patient media people : the answer to all your questions at this time is ' no comment			0
' please stop ringing our bell and calling for interviews			2
" authorities have reason to think the new search could lead to the discovery of the boy 's remains at that location , though they remain wary after past leads in the case failed to pan out , according to two sources familiar with the probe			1
" i hope they find something , " said resident @entity244 , who says he 's lived in the neighborhood since 1976			0
@entity15 , a @entity16 neighborhood now known for its boutique shops , art galleries and loft apartments , at the time was considered a grittier locale , where abandoned storefronts dotted the city streets			0
the boy 's disappearance was thought to raise awareness of child abductions and led to new ways to search for missing children			1
president @entity261 named may 25 , the day @entity79 went missing , @entity262			0
@entity1 's @entity263 contributed to this report .			0
