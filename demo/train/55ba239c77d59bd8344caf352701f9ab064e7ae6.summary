@entity0 -- i was in the building at @entity4 , @entity5 , in june where 43 people were shot this week			1
i was sent to @entity4 along with @entity1 @entity8 correspondent @entity7 and videographer @entity9			1
during our visit , we were in and out of several buildings			1
one of them is now a crime scene , a killing ground in the heart of one of @entity19 's largest military installations			1
col. @entity20 was our public affairs escort			1
when i called him thursday , @entity20 told me the shooting happened at the @entity23 that we had visited during our trip			1
the purpose of our visit was to learn how @entity4 was helping soldiers cope with stress and mental health problems			1
it was a high priority for the commanders there			1
i grabbed the tape and disks with the video from our trip and cued up the video of the center			1
it was just as i remembered -- a low , brick building			1
there was one main entrance			2
a sergeant / nurse was directing traffic as people constantly moved in and out			2
once inside , the space was about the size of a basketball court			2
and there were lines , lines of soldiers everywhere			1
the lines to our right were about half a dozen soldiers deep			1
to the left , about 60 or so soldiers were waiting in another line			1
they got to sit in metal folding chairs			2
but as the line moved , they moved from chair to chair			2
i do n't think any of them got to sit in the same chair more than 30 seconds			2
the place looked like the @entity68 at lunchtime on the last friday of the month			1
only everybody was in @entity72 camouflage fatigues			2
beyond those lines were cubicles , each one with a least one line leading into it			2
all these soldiers were getting paperwork stamped or signed			1
or they were undergoing routine medical examinations			2
one area was just for vaccinations			2
everyone got poked with a needle at least once			2
everything was done out in the open , with only cubicle walls to keep soldiers in one line from seeing what soldiers in the other line were going through			1
i was able to wander around and watch , while @entity7 talked to the top officers and @entity9 took video of all the goings on			1
i remember the only place where someone could get privacy was way in the back , a few small offices with walls and a door that could be closed			0
i was told that 's where soldiers would be taken if a routine mental health exam indicated a more thorough one might be needed			1
what i do n't remember was a back door			0
there may have been one			0
but the only door i remember is the one where the sergeant / nurse was directing traffic			0
and i 've been thinking about her as the details of the shootings emerged			1
the sergeant / nurse was a no - nonsense woman			0
she 'd greet everyone just as they walked in ( first making sure they removed their hats )			0
if they had the right paperwork , she sent them to the first of what would be many lines			0
if they did n't have the right paperwork , she 'd turn them around and send them out to get it			0
and when the soldiers had gone through all the lines , there was to be no loitering by that door			1
she 'd send them on their way			0
i do n't remember her exact rank			0
but i know she was a nurse ; i asked her because she reminded me of my sister who is a nurse and also skilled at " running the show			0
" after we were done in june , i went to her and told her that while there were plenty of captains , majors and colonels around , i could tell this was her facility			1
i was grateful she let us take pictures inside there that day			0
she gave me a quick smile and went right back to work			0
as i write this , i worry about that sergeant / nurse			0
since i do n't remember her name , i may never know if she was there when the horror erupted			0
if she was working , i 'm sure she would have stopped the gunman , asking him why he was there			0
if he was holding two guns , he may not have been able to remove his cap			0
she may not have had enough time to say something			0
i hope she did not become his first victim			0
maybe she 's safe and sound , at home with her loved ones			1
but 43 others are not safe and sound			0
and all over the country , people with friends and family @entity72 are worried about their loved ones			0
was he or she in that building , stuck in line when the shooting began ?			0
