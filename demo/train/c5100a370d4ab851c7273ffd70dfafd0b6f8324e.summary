-- it can appear to the naked eye as a blur ; a frenzied whirlwind of arms and legs , but for @entity7 it epitomized an intoxicating marriage of harmony and balance			1
a sport with an almost unparalleled heritage , stretching back to the fifth century @entity14 , @entity11 is almost evangelical about her desire for the world to rediscover the art and beauty of the discus			1
for over a decade the 34 - year - old has stood alone as @entity22 's leading exponent of the discipline that descended from @entity24 , the omnipresent figure in @entity27 's famous sculpture of a discus thrower from around 450 bc. " it 's a sport that always existed ; we all have in mind the @entity7 statues from @entity24 , " @entity29 told @entity0 's human to @entity31			1
" but the goal is really to show this sport has changed , is interesting to practice and to watch , and to promote it			1
" i think that promotion is a good way of discovering or re-discovering it in its modern aspect			0
" the complexity of the throwing technique -- the element that hooked @entity29 as a teenager -- remains as mysterious as ever , a juxtaposition of intensity , power and calmness			1
as well as proselytizing about the sport 's finer details , @entity29 is equally keen to move away from preconceptions of female discus throwers as bulky and butch			1
" the image of discus throwing for women has changed over the years , " said the @entity22 , who came fifth at the @entity57 -- her fourth consecutive appearance at the @entity59			1
" we are not anymore bodybuilding shaped women			0
we now have very feminine bodies , which are not that different from the norm -- i think it 's really important			2
" there 's been a real evolution			2
it 's really women who are throwing nowadays , for me there are no difficulties regarding this aspect			2
" a latecomer to the sport , she gravitated to the discus from handball -- via the shot put -- at the age of 16 upon the recommendation of her high school sports teacher			1
drawn in by the mystery of the throwing technique -- something she conquered in record time -- @entity29 came second at the @entity91 three years later , before being crowned under - 23 @entity93 champion the following season			1
in between those two successes , the @entity22 appeared in her first @entity57 , in @entity96 in 2000 , going on to compete in @entity97 four years later as the @entity59 staged an emotional homecoming to the place of its birth			1
success on the international stage has been intermittent , but she is dominant on home soil			0
her @entity22 record throw of 65.78 meters has endured for over a decade and only once since 2000 has she not been crowned national champion -- in 2010 when she took a break from the sport to have a baby			1
" when i started , what i liked the most was the difficulty to throw , " said @entity29 , who was born in @entity109 in the @entity110			1
" i did n't really understand how you could throw this sort of device that fast , with perfect trajectories and a flat discus			2
" it 's something that really intrigued me and that 's what pushed me to do it , so i could control it			2
it 's really the complexity of the technique that appealed to me			0
discus throwing is both technical and physical			0
" you have to progress physically , while maintaining the technique and when you make a technical change , you can not lose the physique , so you have to keep the balance			0
" you can be stronger , but if you can not transmit this power into the engine and the technique , the physical strength is useless			0
" with success and failure often coming down to centimeters , all those elements have to be combined to perfection			0
" the qualities of a discus thrower are explosiveness , dynamism and speed , all of that while being very relaxed , " she added			1
" the aim is to go fast while being the longest possible -- it 's quite paradoxical -- but that 's what make it difficult			0
your aim is to have very relaxed arms , to give a lot of time to the discus before it 's thrown			1
" the goal is to feel the discus well in your hand -- i do n't really know how to describe it -- to have a discus that 's like matching my hand			2
i have the feeling that it belongs to my body , to my hands			0
" few could deny @entity29 her four appearances at the greatest showcase in sport , given the peerless determination she has shown to her craft			1
the 30 hours a week she spends practicing have often been alone , her coach @entity171 having to fit training around his other commitments , and conducted in the depths of winter when there is no competition			0
such is the precarious existence of a discus thrower , that @entity29 continued to work and study before turning professional in 2008 , even completing a short stint in the army 's communications department in 2004			1
she still visits schools to talk about her life as an athlete and is desperate to spread the word about her chosen discipline			0
" my ambition is really to promote my sport , so that people get to know it and get to like it			2
you ca n't like it if you do n't know it , " she said			0
" i realize that people who follow my results and get into discus throwing just because they know me , actually start liking it and enjoy watching it or even practicing it			2
" @entity200 has brought me a lot and when i go to schools , my aim is to pass it on and share what it brought to me			0
i want to tell them that they can do things			0
" @entity211 is great because it can be done by every body shape or pattern , everyone can choose their own sport and enjoy it			0
i 've learned a lot from sports and discus throwing , and i want to share what i received			0
