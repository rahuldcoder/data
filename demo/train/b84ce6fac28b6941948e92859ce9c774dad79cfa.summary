-- when the head of the @entity3 says a new virus is her " greatest concern right now , " people worldwide may wonder whether they should be concerned			2
this new coronavirus , which experts recently named @entity8 or @entity10 respiratory syndrome coronavirus , first surfaced in @entity11 in spring 2012			1
it 's in the same family of viruses as @entity15 ( severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus ) as well as the common cold -- but the new virus is not @entity15			1
" there 's not the same level of concern as there was in @entity26 or @entity27 during the sars epidemic , " says dr. @entity18 , a professor of pediatrics and longtime coronavirus researcher at @entity21			1
unlike @entity15 which sickened more than 8,000 people in 2003 and killed 773 worldwide , this new coronavirus does not spread easily between humans -- at least not yet			1
it 's too early to tell whether @entity8 is going to spread or just burn out , so it 's essential that health officials stay vigilant , @entity18 says			1
" what 's important is continued reporting of active cases which allows for better surveillance			2
" 5 things to know about new coronavirus should i be concerned about @entity8 ? so far only 49 cases of @entity8 have been reported , including 27 deaths			1
most of those were older men with other health problems			0
and most contracted the virus in the @entity10 : @entity11 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49			1
cases have been reported in three @entity52 countries ( @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 ) and @entity56			0
but those cases had either traveled from the @entity10 or in a few instances were infected through close contact with someone who recently returned from one of the above countries			1
as of now , if you have n't been to the @entity66 , your chance of a @entity8 infection is probably considerably less than 1 % , or even zero , as all the cases have been linked to that region , says @entity3 spokesman @entity69			1
what researchers do n't know is how many people may have had mild symptoms and never were reported			2
the more information scientists have , the more can be done to try to combat the disease			0
i recently returned from the @entity10			2
what signs should i look for ? if you 've traveled to the countries above and have cold - like symptoms which are getting worse , and you 're having increasing difficulty breathing and a fever , you may want to see a doctor			0
it 's important to tell your physician where you have been , so you can be tested for regular flu and other illnesses that can cause these symptoms as well as @entity8			1
the @entity3 describes the common symptoms as acute , serious respiratory illness with fever , cough , shortness of breath and breathing difficulties			0
according to @entity69 , the real worry is that patients will develop pneumonia -- most , although not all , of the cases have			0
many have also had gastrointestinal problems including diarrhea			0
new virus takes more lives , spreads what should i avoid ? the original source of the infection is still a mystery , so health officials can not tell you what to avoid to prevent getting this coronavirus			0
researchers have n't identified any animal that may be carrying the virus			0
early on in the @entity15 outbreak , an animal called the civet cat was implicated -- maybe unfairly , because bats were later implicated too			2
it 's not known how the virus spreads between humans , be it droplets in the air from coughing or sneezing or touching contaminated surfaces , but who is n't ruling out contact with surfaces as a possible mechanism of transmission			2
it 's also not known how long the virus can live outside the body			0
the sars virus was shown to live as long as four days			0
other viruses , such as @entity136 , lose their ability to be infectious within hours			0
how can i help my family ? while there 's no cure for @entity8 , there are things you can do to protect your loved ones -- the same measures you would take to prevent spreading the flu or other viruses			1
if you 've recently returned from @entity10 and are n't feeling well , stay home and avoid contact with babies and people who may already be sick			1
cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze ( tissue , sleeve or elbow , not your hands ) and wash your hands frequently			0
there currently is no vaccine or treatment for @entity8			2
a lot has been learned about new coronaviruses over the past 10 years by studying the sars virus because the @entity167 have continued to support research on it , @entity18 says , adding that he 's hopeful that knowledge could be " potentially applied towards vaccines , " if @entity8 develops into a pandemic			1
new virus is a ' threat to the entire world '			0

if you have n't traveled to the @entity10 , your chances of being infected are low
there 's not the same level of concern as seen with @entity15 , an expert says
there is still much experts do n't know about @entity8
