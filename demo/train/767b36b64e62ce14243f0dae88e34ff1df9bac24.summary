@entity0 is asking for your help			1
no , you do not get to go to space			2
you do , however , get to view hundreds of thousands of images taken from space			2
via @entity6 to astronaut photography of @entity8 , @entity0 is making available images ranging from the @entity12 missions of the 1960s to photos recently snapped from the @entity15			1
the hope , @entity0 says , is that the images " could help save energy , contribute to better human health and safety and improve our understanding of atmospheric chemistry			1
but scientists need your help to make that happen			0
" the catalog contains more than 1.8 million photos , about 1.3 million of them from the space station and roughly 30 % of them taken at night			1
before 2003 , night images from the space station could be blurry , even with high - speed film and manual tracking , because the station moves at about 17,500 mph			1
in 2003 , enterprising astronaut @entity33 used a drill and assorted parts he found on the station to cobble together a " barn - door tracker , " a lower - tech predecessor to the @entity40 's @entity39 , which was installed at the space station nine years later			1
@entity39 's motorized tripod compensates for the space station 's speed , providing what @entity0 scientist @entity44 says are the highest - resolution night images from orbit			1
satellites collect data more regularly , but the photos tend to be lower resolution			0
" now the pictures are clear , but their location may not be , which limits their usefulness			0
that 's where citizen science comes in , " the @entity0 news release says			2
the @entity59 is spearheading efforts to catalog the photos and corral citizen input			2
it 's broken the images into three components requiring different levels of participation : 1			0
this is the easiest project , as it requires no scientific expertise			0
" anyone can help " by sorting the images into the categories : cities , stars or other objects , said @entity72 , doctoral student at @entity59			1
" without the help of citizens , it is almost impossible to use these images scientifically			0
algorithms can not distinguish between stars , cities and other objects , such as the moon			0
humans are much more efficient for complex image analysis , " he said			0
looking at night images , citizen scientists can tap their knowledge of local geography to match photos with positions on maps			1
residents of a city can more easily identify a city 's features than those who do n't live there , @entity72 said			0
the data will be used to generate light maps of cities			0
this is the trickiest , as it aims to identify cities in photos with 310 - mile circumferences			1
" we do n't know which direction the astronaut pointed the camera , only where the station was at the time the image was taken , " @entity72 said			0
" some images are bright cities , but others are small towns			2
it is like a puzzle with 300,000 pieces			0
" hundreds of volunteers have stepped up so far , classifying almost 20,000 photos , but @entity0 says multiple individuals should review each image to ensure accuracy			2
the " open atlas of nighttime images " can be used to assess economic conditions , @entity72 said			2
one photo of the @entity134 shows how @entity135 is a barely lit swath of land between the heavily illuminated nations of @entity139 and @entity140			0
@entity72 also cited the examples of @entity142 and @entity143			1
" @entity142 is the capital of @entity145 , a country facing a major economic crisis			1
it is much brighter in astronaut images than @entity143 , the capital of @entity149 , the country with the healthiest economy in @entity151			1
perhaps that is an indication that @entity149 more efficiently manages its resources			0
the images can provide evidence and data to verify that			0
" other aims of the project include evaluating street lighting for safety purposes as well as to analyze light pollution and its effects on human health .			1

until recently , night images taken from 17,500 - mph space station could be blurry
@entity0 says images could improve health , safety , grasp on atmospheric chemistry
@entity59 in @entity142 broke images down into three categories with different aims
*researcher* : @entity142 brighter than @entity143 , despite economic *disparity* between cities
