-- in many ways , my life is ordinary and extraordinary at the same time			1
i am a working mother with three young children ages 2 , 4 and 6			1
i got them dressed today			1
we fought over wearing hats because it was cold outside			1
i dropped them off and kissed their chubby cheeks			1
i am the @entity14 treasurer for my daughter 's school			1
i am a volunteer in the community			1
i am a wife to a partner i have been with nearly 14 years			1
i live in a suburb			1
i have all the trappings of a comfortable life			1
i am content in my daily life			1
what sets me apart from the typical soccer mom is that i am an outspoken recovering heroin addict			1
many people might be familiar with my story from the movie " @entity28 : the @entity29			1
" i agreed to be featured in the film because i thought it would live on after i died from an overdose as a testimonial to the dangers of drug addiction			1
yet i survived eight years of heroin addiction			1
i was one of the lucky few from that time period when treatment options and evidence - based treatment solutions were limited			1
i started my journey as a heroin addict while a college student in @entity43			1
i had been given @entity44 after removal of my wisdom teeth			1
i fell in love with that feeling opiates provided me			1
my burdens seemed to slip away under the influence			2
i longed for that feeling			2
after experimenting with many drugs , i found opiates provided me with the ability to forget my problems			2
no longer was i obsessed with feeling different			2
i was happy with being numb			2
my addiction quickly spiraled until i ended up being a homeless junkie in the streets of @entity60 's @entity59			1
at first i was doing the drugs , but in short order the drugs began to control every aspect of my life			2
i was living on the streets and in and out of rat - infested hotels			2
in a few short years , i was completely unrecognizable as my former self			2
my last day using was february 26 , 1998			2
i was injecting heroin into the soles of my feet because i no longer had any usable veins			2
i could barely walk , i was emaciated , and i was relieved when i was arrested that night			2
i spent my first months off drugs in the @entity74			2
this was not my first time detoxing from heroin			0
fortunately , it would be my last time			0
i was able to get into a treatment program followed by a sober - living house , where i lived for four years			0
in the years i have been off heroin , i have struggled with depression , post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety			0
many addicts find that once the drugs are removed , the underlying cause to the use can be nearly as painful as the use itself			1
when the drugs are removed , there can be an overwhelming sense of sadness			0
getting clean can be seen as the ultimate solution			0
when the veil of chemicals lifts , the person may not like what is revealed to him or her			0
i dealt with these feelings without using heroin			0
however , the thought crossed my mind many times that relief can easily be found at the bottom of a spoon			0
that is part of my affliction			0
everyone has a different treatment story			0
the reality for me was and is that stopping use of the substance is relatively easy compared with staying off drugs			0
the lifetime commitment to abstinence from drugs is what kills many people			0
when they have cravings to use , the stigma attached to heroin use forces them to deal or not deal with their affliction in private			0
this decision is frequently fatal , as in the case of @entity129			0
if we were courageous enough to try to conquer our insatiable desire for heroin , we feel weak telling another person that we feel like using is once again a viable option			0
fifteen years later , i still deal with the stigma of being a heroin addict			0
the track marks and scars are visible , but the pain of longing lies deep under the surface			0
many heroin addicts are embarrassed to admit they ever had a problem with this powerful substance			0
if you are open about it , it triggers speculation and scrutiny as to your personal well - being			0
addiction is a medical condition , yet there is little sympathy because society views it to be self - inflicted			1
i have chosen a different path for myself			0
i chose to be completely open about my experience in hope that others can learn that recovery is possible			1
what will i tell my children ? they are too young to understand drugs , but they know i used to be homeless			1
i want them to understand how fortunate they are in hopes they will not go down the same path			0
what do i say when people see the movie and contact me through social media looking for answers to their own addiction ? there are many roads to recovery			1
the path that i followed worked for me , but i can not dictate what may work for another user struggling to get off drugs			0
i can only share my experience			0
i have spent my second chance at life teaching both harm reduction and overdose prevention because all of us have a life worth saving			0
i feel blessed i am able to bring a voice and a face to the issue .			0
