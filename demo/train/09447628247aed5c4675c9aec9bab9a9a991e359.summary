-- tropical cyclones in the @entity2 do not worry some @entity4 residents because direct hits historically have been so rare on the islands			1
@entity4 is a small target in a large ocean			1
but the state finds itself prepping ahead of what could be a pair of back - to - back smacks from @entity13 and @entity14			1
even if these two storms weaken or do n't make landfall -- as is usually the case around @entity4 -- they can still cause damage , including flooding and debris , experts warn			1
try telling that to @entity23 , who has lived in @entity24 , on @entity4 's @entity26 island , for more than 60 years			1
" people are not really nervous , but honestly just hoping for some good surf , " said @entity23 , who owns the @entity27			0
" surfers get excited when hurricane season starts			2
the people here are really nonchalant and are used to rain , which is the main thing we are expecting			0
" there are no lines at the supermarket or stocking of supplies , even though @entity13 is on a forecast track to hit the islands on thursday			2
" i 'm not worried about this storm , " @entity23 said			2
history appears to back him up			0
a 2002 report by the @entity46 states that " actual hurricane strikes on the @entity48 are relatively rare in the modern record			2
" " more commonly , near - misses that generate large swell and moderately high winds causing varying degrees of damage are the hallmark of hurricanes passing close to the islands , " according to the report			2
a primer on @entity59 in @entity4 by the @entity60 says just as much : " hurricanes are relatively rare events in the @entity48			1
" however , even if @entity13 and @entity14 change course and miss the islands , it does not mean that dangers are averted			1
flying debris poses a risk , and back - to - back storms over an area that is already saturated makes for a flooding risk			0
officials at the state and local level are not taking the risks that @entity13 and @entity14 pose lightly			1
" we are actually monitoring very closely			0
we 've had several tropical systems since june 1 , " said @entity75 of the @entity76			2
" the ground is very saturated			0
we are very hopeful it will weaken			2
however , it still is likely to present tropical storm force winds at 74 mph , high surf at 10 to 15 feet , and heavy rain			1
" as of tuesday , @entity13 was a category 3 hurricane but was expected to weaken as it neared @entity4 , according to the @entity86			1
@entity14 , on the other hand , could strengthen to hurricane force by the time it reaches the islands			1
" we are very concerned with the flooding that will be possible from having two major storms so close together , " @entity92 spokesman chief petty officer @entity92 said			0
the @entity96 's priority is keeping the @entity97 open , where 90 % of the state 's goods and services pass through , he said			0
the agency is asking residents to stock up on supplies for at least seven days , as power outages are expected			0
honolulu mayor @entity105 has issued a similar warning			0
" yes , it is a concern if both storms hit back to back because the ground will be saturated with water , increasing the odds of flooding , " he said			0
many @entity4 residents spread the news of the coming storms via social media , but not all were worried about what they could bring			1
" ca n't wait for the storm to hit , i 'm ready for some rain , " one @entity120 user in @entity4 wrote			1
another wrote : " is it bad that my family is doing literally nothing to prepare for the hurricane ? " @entity4 's primary elections are slated for saturday			1
local media reported that many turned up for early voting in anticipation of severe weather on election day			0
others are concerned that voting turnout could be affected			0
some shelters will be set up in the same buildings where voting is to be held , the governor 's office said .			0

hurricanes rarely make landfall in @entity4
but one hurricane and one tropical storm are heading that way
@entity13 could weaken and @entity14 could strengthen
officials being *cautious* , but some residents less so
