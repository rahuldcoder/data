@entity0 -- the @entity2 on wednesday passed a @entity4 plan to extend the @entity6 - era tax cuts for middle income americans while rejecting a @entity9 alternative to continue all of the cuts -- twin votes that help to crystallize the position of the two parties on a critical issue heading into the fall campaign			1
the @entity4 proposal passed in a sharply polarized 51 - 48 vote , while the @entity9 plan was defeated 45 - 54			1
vice president @entity19 , the constitutional presiding officer of the @entity2 , was on hand to cast a tie - breaking vote if necessary			2
strategists on both sides of the aisle acknowledge that neither plan has a chance of passing both the @entity4 - controlled @entity2 and the @entity9 - controlled @entity27			1
@entity9 leaders in the @entity27 have indicated they have no intention of bringing the @entity4 ' plan to a vote			1
house speaker @entity32 , @entity33 , pledged in a written statement after the votes to " stop the tax hike , " and insisted @entity9 are the only ones addressing the " threat to our economy			2
" @entity41 chairman @entity40 blasted @entity4 for backing a " disastrous plan to raise taxes on small businesses and job creators " while putting " their tax - and - spend agenda ahead of creating jobs			1
" president @entity49 , however , said , " @entity50 are now the only people left in @entity0 holding hostage the middle - class tax cuts for 98 % of @entity54			1
" the @entity54 economy " is n't built from the top down , it 's built from a strong and growing middle class , and that 's who we should be fighting for , " he declared			0
rival @entity6 tax plans wednesday 's votes were primarily about political positioning in the heat of the 2012 election season , as well each party 's opening bid in what is sure to be a frenzied legislative negotiating session this autumn			2
the economy is approaching a so - called " fiscal cliff " brought on by the looming expiration of several tax cuts as well as the approach of a series of mandatory spending cuts			1
" at the end of the day this ( legislative maneuvering ) is n't going to solve the problem			0
it 's going to be political posturing all the way up to the november election , " said sen. @entity82 , @entity83			0
the @entity4 bill approved by the @entity2 on wednesday would extend the @entity6 tax cuts -- now set to expire at the end of the year -- just on incomes under $ 250,000 for a couple and $ 200,000 for an individual			1
the @entity9 bill would extend the tax cuts for all taxpayers -- including the wealthiest @entity54 -- and includes a requirement that @entity97 tackle comprehensive tax reform within a year			1
@entity9 argue that any tax hikes could derail what is already considered a weak recovery			0
opinion : @entity103 is headed our way after @entity2 leaders jockeyed for days over procedural issues tied to consideration of the bills , senate minority leader @entity106 , @entity107 , unexpectedly announced wednesday morning that @entity9 would agree to @entity4 demands and hold back - to - back votes requiring neither side to garner a filibuster - proof 60 - vote margin			1
@entity117 's decision gave the @entity4 bragging rights , allowing them to tout the fact that their bill is capable of passing the @entity2			2
but it also gave republicans the ability to put several centrist @entity4 senators on the spot , forcing those @entity4 to vote for a politically contentious plan that raises taxes on certain @entity54			2
" we owe it to the @entity54 people to let them know whether we actually think it is a good idea to double down on the failed economic policies of the past few years or whether we support a new approach , " @entity117 said before the vote			0
" by setting these votes at a 50 - vote threshold , nobody on the other side can hide behind a procedural vote while leaving their views on the actual bill itself a mystery			0
" for their part , @entity4 point to polling that shows a majority of @entity54 support their approach			0
" our bill has the support of president @entity49 , has the support of the @entity4 caucus and has the support of the @entity54 people			2
a majority of @entity54 , including a significant majority of @entity9 , agree taxes should remain low for the middle class and the top 2 % should pay their fair share to reduce the deficit , " said senate majority leader @entity155 , @entity156			0
" the only place there is no agreement is with @entity9 in @entity97			0
" want to attend one of the political conventions ? tell us why @entity1 should send you			0
opinion : give hardworking @entity54 a break			0
