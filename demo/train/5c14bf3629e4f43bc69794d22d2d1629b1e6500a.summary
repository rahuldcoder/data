little more than a week after it suspended " @entity2 " star @entity1 for incendiary remarks about homosexuality , the cable channel @entity0 said friday that it would include him in future tapings of the reality television show , effectively lifting the suspension amid a flurry of petitions in support of @entity1			1
" after discussions with the @entity1 family , as well as consulting with numerous advocacy groups , @entity0 has decided to resume filming @entity2 later this spring with the entire @entity1 family , " the channel said in a statement			1
in an apparent gesture to the advocacy groups , @entity0 said that it would " also use this moment " to broadcast public service announcements " promoting unity , tolerance and acceptance among all people			2
" @entity1 's son @entity24 wrote on @entity25 on friday evening , " back to work ! ! ! so proud of all the fans of the show and family			1
@entity29 may be a little crude but his heart is good			1
he 's the @entity32 ! " the announcement came nine days after @entity0 originally suspended @entity1			1
it was immediately perceived as a victory by some of the conservative groups that had protested the suspension			0
one headline on the influential @entity39 on friday evening was " @entity40 " ; another read , " @entity42			0
" @entity43 , founder of @entity44 , the group that gathered 260,000 signatures on a petition at @entity47 , said in a friday night statement that he and individuals like him would " remain vigilant as we measure whether @entity0 's actions reflect true tolerance , diversity , and mutual respect -- including their equal embrace of our biblically based values and deeply held beliefs			1
" the comments from @entity43 and other advocates signaled that " @entity2 " has become a weapon in the culture wars -- and will continue to be			2
@entity0 said on december 18 that it was placing @entity1 " under hiatus from filming indefinitely " due to the cast member 's controversial comments to a @entity65 interviewer			1
when the interviewer asked @entity1 what he thought was sinful , he replied , " start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there			2
@entity71 , sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men			0
" @entity1 used language that his family later described as " coarse			1
" at one point he remarked that " it seems like , to me , a vagina -- as a man -- would be more desirable than a man 's anus			0
i 'm just thinking : there 's more there ! she 's got more to offer			0
i mean , come on , dudes ! " furthermore , @entity1 said that when he was growing up in @entity93 in the pre-civil rights era , " i never , with my eyes , saw the mistreatment of any black person			2
" he continued , " where we lived was all farmers			0
the blacks worked for the farmers			0
i hoed cotton with them			0
i 'm with the blacks , because we 're white trash			0
we 're going across the field			0
... they 're singing and happy			0
i never heard one of them , one black person , say , ' i tell you what : these doggone white people ' -- not a word ! pre-entitlement , pre-welfare , you say : were they happy ? they were godly ; they were happy ; no one was singing the blues			0
" when the comments were published by @entity65 , gay rights groups , including @entity119 ( formerly the @entity119 ) , and civil rights groups , including the @entity121 , alerted @entity0			2
the channel moved quickly to express disappointment in the comments and put @entity1 on the bench			2
but it said the action would n't affect any previously taped episodes of the hugely popular reality show			0
one season 's worth of episodes featuring @entity1 had already been taped , so the suspension would only have affected future tapings in 2014			1
an assortment of conservative and religious groups immediately and loudly protested the suspension decision by @entity0 , which is jointly owned by the @entity139 and @entity140			1
speculation ensued about whether " @entity2 " would come to an end , at least on @entity0			1
some advocates said they hoped that a channel with overtly religious values would rescue the show			0
the @entity1 family stoked the speculation by issuing a statement that said , " we have had a successful working relationship with @entity0 but , as a family , we can not imagine the show going forward without our patriarch at the helm			1
we are in discussions with @entity0 to see what that means for the future of ' @entity2			1
' " inside @entity0 , a sudden end to " @entity2 " was never seriously contemplated			1
the show is enormously profitable for @entity0 and , executives there pointed out in private , for the @entity163 , too			1
( any shopper strolling through @entity165 , where the aisles are stocked with " @entity2 " gear , would recognize that			2
) but @entity0 executives felt they had to send a message of disapproval after seeing @entity1 's comments to @entity65 , partly because some of the channel 's own staffers were offended by the interview			1
the suspension announced on december 18 sent that message -- and shortly thereafter , the channel and the @entity163 ' representatives started to discuss a path forward			0
" we knew we had a great partnership with the family , " said an @entity0 executive , speaking on condition of anonymity because the channel and the family had agreed not to say anything publicly aside from friday 's statements			1
talks between the two sides took place on christmas eve , paused on @entity194 , and resumed on thursday , leading to friday 's announcement			0
while some observers accused @entity0 of backing down , some of the advocacy groups that were originally dismayed by @entity1 's remarks on homosexuality begged to differ			1
" it 's not really a reversal , " @entity201 , a representative of the @entity121 , told @entity203 's @entity202 in a telephone interview on friday			0
" we think it 's actually a positive outcome , and we want to thank @entity0 for their attentiveness and collaboration over the course of the last few weeks			1
" @entity201 said that his group was " heartened " by @entity0 's plans for the public service announcement campaign			1
a spokesman for @entity0 declined to comment on whether @entity1 or other " @entity2 " cast members would participate in the campaign , but the channel is said to be hopeful that at least some of the cast members will			1
" we 've received assurances also that the @entity1 family is now open to working with @entity224 and ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) people to address the real harm that such anti-gay and racist comments can cause , " @entity201 said on @entity203			1
" that 's been our ' ask ' since @entity233 's comments ran in @entity65 , and while it 's a positive step , it certainly can not and should not be the last one			0
" @entity119 took a more adversarial stance , stating friday night that " @entity1 should look @entity224 and gay people in the eyes and hear about the hurtful impact of praising @entity240 laws and comparing gay people to terrorists			2
if dialogue with @entity233 is not part of next steps then @entity243 has chosen profits over @entity224 and gay people -- especially its employees and viewers			0
" for supporters of groups like @entity119 , the " @entity2 " debate was primarily about whether offensive depictions of minorities -- what @entity119 called " vile and extreme stereotypes " -- were acceptable in public discourse			2
these people said no. for supporters of @entity1 , including a number of conservative politicians , the debate was about whether a deeply religious man had the right to speak freely about the tenets of his faith			0
to some degree the two sides talked past each other while the @entity1 suspension became national news			2
@entity271 , the @entity272 governor of @entity93 , who suggested on december 19 that @entity0 did not believe in the @entity273 , said friday that he was glad the channel 's executives " came to their senses and recognized that tolerance of religious views is more important than political correctness			2
" @entity271 added , " today is a good day for the freedoms of speech and religious liberty			0
the left is going to have to get accustomed to the fact that it does not have a monopoly on free speech and is not the only group who is permitted to voice its opinion in the public square			0
the left may control @entity293 , but they do n't control the hearts and minds of a majority of @entity298			0

" @entity29 may be a little crude but his heart is good , " @entity300 says on @entity25
" @entity2 " star @entity1 was suspended by @entity0
the suspension followed @entity1 's remarks about homosexuality and race
@entity0 now says the show will resume " with the entire @entity1 family "
