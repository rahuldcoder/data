april 13 , 1975 -- one of the darkest dates in @entity3 history			1
an attack on a busload of @entity6 in @entity7 that day sparked a civil war that would rage for 15 years , leaving some 150,000 dead , the capital divided along sectarian lines and sections of the country in ruins			1
but ask students in the city today of the significance of the date , and you get mixed responses			0
" i think it was a very important occasion for @entity3 , " says @entity20 , a student in @entity7 's @entity21			1
" but i do n't know what happened			0
" explains fellow student @entity24 : " we are studying about ... @entity26			0
we are not studying about the civil war , or what happened to @entity3			1
" more than two decades after the end of the country 's civil war , generations of young @entity3 are growing up with little formal education about the conflict			1
home to contesting political groups representing 18 religious communities , @entity3 society contains many deep divisions , and the country 's recent past is widely considered too contentious to examine in depth			1
to avoid inflaming old hostilities , @entity3 history textbooks stop in 1943 , the year the country gained independence			1
" we have a vacant hole in our history books , " said independent scholar dr. @entity47 , adding that this absence from the textbooks reflected society 's broader silence regarding the conflict			1
" there 's been no discussion , no writing , " she added			0
" it 's almost as if we wanted to apply to history the amnesty laws that we applied immediately after the civil war , and said ' nobody is to blame , everybody is equally not responsible for what happened			1
' " see also : @entity3 's women prisoners find freedom behind bars the country 's minister of education , @entity68 , acknowledges it 's all about politics			1
" after more than 20 years ... the teaching of history in @entity3 remains , as it has always been , subject to the interests of various political groups , " said @entity68			1
others caution that failing to teach younger generations a balanced view of their history could reinforce sectarian divisions			2
@entity81 said that the absence of a comprehensive , authoritative history of the war left events of the period " open for interpretation			2
" " the children turn to their families and to their communities to learn very particular perspectives of this contemporary history , " she said			2
@entity81 said that a survey of 3,000 @entity3 14 - year - olds conducted in 2007 - 8 found that the historical @entity3 figures children most strongly identified with were leaders from their own sectarian background			2
" what we discovered throughout ... the questionnaire is that children tend to learn and directly absorb the values of their parents and their communities			0
schools were not places where children went to learn about these things , " she said			0
" i think this is in part playing a big role in the kind of sectarian division we 're seeing today			0
" see also : sights and sounds of @entity7 's " @entity116 " dr. @entity117 , a psychoanalyst and history researcher , agreed			2
" they only have the oral history that their parents told them , " she said			0
" you grow up with deep divisions that become even deeper with time			0
there 's no sense of closure , there 's no coming to terms with your past			0
" the result , she said , was a heightened risk of communities becoming " stuck in the cycle of violence			0
" in this regard , she said , @entity3 remained a society " without closure			2
