-- did you know that buying @entity3 seafood could save a whale ? a new report from the @entity6 finds that 91 % of seafood consumed in the @entity3 is imported and nearly every wild - caught foreign fish product sold in the @entity3 violates the @entity9 , endangering the lives of marine mammals around the world			1
countries exporting fish to @entity3 are supposed to prove they use safe methods to catch fish destined for the @entity3 market			2
but for decades the @entity3 has failed to enforce this law			0
that means whales , dolphins and sea lions are at risk , and @entity3 fishermen who invest in safer methods have a disadvantage in the marketplace			1
commercial fishing fleets target species for the global market , including @entity3 consumers			0
they go after the seafood we love to eat like shrimp , salmon , tuna , crab , and lobster , setting traps and casting gillnets , purse seines , trawls and longlines			0
but in the course of catching the target species , they often entangle , trap and hook other animals like non-target fish , seabirds , sea turtles and marine mammals			1
it 's a tragedy for those animals caught in the wrong place and the wrong time -- collateral damage that may cause some populations to go extinct			0
there are ways to reduce this harm			0
until the @entity3 enforces the @entity9 , which requires importing countries to prove they are meeting @entity3 standards , consumers can play a role in protecting whales , dolphins and sea lions			2
when making sustainable fish purchases consider helping marine mammals by buying @entity3 - caught wild seafood			1
in many parts of the world , poor fishing practices are driving populations and species of marine mammals to extinction			0
research estimate that more than 650,000 whales , dolphins and other marine mammals are killed or seriously injured every year by foreign fishing fleets after getting trapped , entangled , or hooked in commercial fishing gear			1
while @entity3 fishers and foreign fishers exporting to the @entity3 are required to comply with the @entity9 to reduce this unintended " bycatch " of marine mammals , the @entity3 currently enforces the law against @entity3 fishers , but lets most foreign fishers off the hook with its failure to enforce the law			1
after 40 years , the government has indicated it is finally moving to require that imported seafood meets @entity3 standards for marine mammal bycatch			2
we know about whale , dolphin and sea lion populations suffering from bycatch from fisheries that likely export at least some of their product to the @entity3			2
we found that @entity113 right whales , @entity115 sea lions , @entity117 sperm whales , vaquitas , spinner dolphins in the @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 harbor porpoises , j - stock minke whales and false killer whales in the @entity126 and @entity127 are threatened by fisheries bycatch and that enforcing the @entity9 's provision against imports from these fisheries could force foreign fishing fisheries to adopt better practices that would save the lives of animals from these populations			2
enforcement wo n't be easy and wo n't necessarily be quick			0
motivating foreign fisheries around the globe to adopt better practices that will benefit marine mammals is a tall order			1
but continued access to the @entity3 market is a great motivator			0
while some fisheries may decide it 's not worth the hassle , others will view protecting marine mammals as an opportunity to continue a lucrative relationship with @entity3 consumers who love fish , but also want to know that foreign fisheries are working to limit harm to the whales , dolphins and sea lions that they also love			1
the greatest danger at this point is that the @entity3 government will drag its feet and issue enforcement regulations that are too weak or otherwise run afoul of other binding agreements , like @entity167 requirements that bar treating countries unequally			0
the government could also continue the status quo by failing to take any action to hold foreign fisheries accountable			0
for 40 years , federal watchdogs have failed to enforce a law that could save thousands of whales and dolphins from negligent foreign fishing practices each year			0
until foreign fleets see real consequences for failing to abide by the law , marine mammals will continue to be harmed around the world and @entity3 fishermen will be disadvantaged			1
no one wants their shrimp cocktail to come with a side of dolphin , but that 's essentially what 's happening when we eat imported fish that is n't held to the same standards as @entity3 seafood			1
next time you order that tuna steak , ask where it was caught and consider voting with your wallet and only buy @entity3 , wild - caught seafood			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			0

@entity201 : did you know that buying @entity3 seafood could save a whale ?
@entity201 : much of wild - caught foreign fish product sold in @entity3 endanger marine mammals
he says since *90* % of seafood eaten in the @entity3 is imported , consumers have a say
@entity201 : demand foreign fisheries use safer methods to avoid catching dolphins , whales
