-- @entity1 on tuesday reached another milestone by being upgraded from critical to serious condition at the @entity5 hospital where she has valiantly fought a condition caused by flesh - eating bacteria			1
according to @entity9 of @entity10 , both critical and serious conditions include a patient having vital signs that are unstable and not within normal limits			0
whereas a patient in critical condition may be unconscious and have indicators that are " unfavorable , " a person in serious condition is acutely ill with indicators that are " questionable			2
" @entity19 , 24 , late last month began breathing on her own and talking for the first time in weeks , and even cracked jokes			2
the bacteria led surgeons to amputate her hands , part of her abdomen , one of her legs and her remaining foot in an effort to stay ahead of the disease			0
the young @entity33 , @entity5 , woman 's ordeal began may 1 , when she was riding a makeshift zip line across the @entity37 , about 50 miles west of @entity38			0
the line snapped , and she fell and got a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close			0
three days later , still in pain , she went to an emergency room			0
doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh - devouring bacterium @entity46			1
surviving flesh - eating bacteria since then , her father , @entity49 , has written regularly about her situation , and the psychology department at the @entity52 -- where @entity1 has been pursuing her master 's degree in psychology -- also has posted regular updates online			1
family counters flesh - eating bacteria with faith			1
