-- @entity2 quarterback @entity1 was involved in the big game in @entity4 , where he helped his team perform another miraculous comeback in the fourth quarter with time running out			1
but the action did n't take place at @entity10 , home of @entity11			0
it was a virtual gridiron battle at @entity14 ' @entity13 played on @entity15 at the @entity16			1
@entity1 was part of the three - member " @entity18 , " which also featured @entity20 quarterback @entity19 and his teammate and tight end , @entity23			1
the trio beat the " @entity37 " 16 - 13 in a dramatic comeback , sending @entity26 ( wide receiver , @entity28 ) , @entity29 ( quarterback , @entity31 ) , and @entity32 ( running back , @entity34 ) home without the coveted trophy			1
@entity19 admitted that @entity1 " brings the magic , " although in a twist , it was @entity19 who played quarterback during that final drive with @entity1 playing wide receiver			1
@entity1 , who was on the cover of @entity14 @entity46 , said he was just happy to be part of the video game tournament			1
" it 's humbling to be here with these other great athletes and football players , just to be around them , to be friends with them , to continue to build relationships is wonderful , " said @entity1			1
" and then all of the opportunities we have to be in the @entity61 game , to be in the @entity13 , it really is a privilege			1
" even veteran players like @entity65 tight end @entity64 are drawn to the virtual competition , which offers something much more important than that trophy			0
" the @entity13 is popular because it 's still a competition , " said @entity64			1
" we 're built on competition			0
our characteristics are about competing and winning			0
when you come here , you get to see other players and enjoy the festivities			0
but in the back of everybody 's mind , you still want to win the @entity13			1
even if it 's not all over the news , you still want the bragging rights			2
" @entity64 said he and @entity83 running back @entity82 , who won @entity84 , spent time talking about this year 's competition while in @entity86 at the @entity87 last weekend			2
" it 's something like the @entity92 , " said @entity89 wide receiver and @entity87 mvp @entity90			2
" a lot of guys take pride in their @entity61 game and wagers are made			0
and it 's always fun to watch			0
" @entity14 keeps @entity100 's biggest names involved in the tournament , even after they hang up their cleats			1
the @entity104 team featured @entity105 and @entity106 and @entity107 , who retired in 2008			0
" when they came out with the four buttons on the front , that 's when i quit playing @entity61 , " said @entity107 , laughing			0
" it was just too much			0
it was just too much			0
" the competition , which @entity107 said is a whole new brand from when he used to play in the @entity100 , was too much for this trio			2
but they enjoy the focus the video game puts on the sport they still love to watch			1
with a constant influx of new talent , the rookies typically have an edge with video game skills , as many have been weaned on the intricate controllers that the @entity129 and @entity131 generation have had to learn			1
but just as fans see on the real field , nothing beats experience and football knowledge			0
" playing in the @entity13 is a tremendous experience , " said @entity138 veteran running back @entity139 , who played on the @entity140 in the tournament this year			1
" guys come into the locker room and say , ' hey , i just got through killing with you in @entity61			0
' so it 's an awesome feeling and @entity61 helped me get the name that i have today			0
" @entity2 linebacker @entity149 came to the party to check out the high definition gridiron action , which has become " the game before the game " during @entity92 week			0
" it 's crazy to be in @entity61 , " said @entity100 rookie @entity149			1
" that 's another dream			0
i always dreamed of playing in the @entity100 and to be in @entity61 is just amazing			2
i only play @entity61 , so it 's a big deal			0
" not everyone was happy with the outcome of @entity13			1
perhaps no player takes the video game tournament more seriously than @entity82			1
he said he plays @entity61 every day and is constantly preparing himself for the competition			0
he was n't happy with the format change from player versus player to three - man teams last year			2
" i can beat anyone here one - on - one , which is the way @entity61 is supposed to be played , " said @entity82 , who was part of the @entity140 with @entity169 linebacker @entity168 and @entity139			2
as for @entity1 , he does n't have as much time since going pro to play video games			1
but he is just as competitive as he is on the real field when it comes to @entity13 , as were his teammates			2
" i enjoy playing @entity61 , " said @entity1			2
" i stay pretty busy , so it 's not like i can play it a lot			0
but i have a good time playing with my brothers and teammates and we get pretty competitive on it			0
" that competitive nature has already started with @entity186			0
@entity14 announced at the @entity13 that 64 players -- two players from each @entity100 team -- will compete for the chance to be on the cover of the new game			1
fans will have the final say once again , after picking @entity194 running back @entity195 for this year 's game			2
can @entity1 work his magic again and grace the cover of this august 's football game ? do n't count him out .			1
