-- once a haven for painters seduced by its rich colors , @entity1 is back on track to become a world - leading destination for photographers thanks to the arrival of a major new museum			1
despite the reluctance of many in the city to have their image captured on film , the city already enjoys a strong relationship with the camera			1
it 's the only place in @entity21 that can boast an art venue -- @entity23 127 -- that exclusively exhibits photographs			2
recently it hosted an opening , at the @entity28 , by prestigious photographer @entity29			2
major photography museum on the way the city 's photography scene is likely to explode over the next few years as it prepares for the 2016 arrival of the @entity36 for @entity37 and @entity38			1
when it opens , the mmp + , as it 's known , is expected to be the largest space for photography and digital visual media in the world			1
the imposing building will exhibit images from the 19th century alongside contemporary artists from around the world			2
the ambition of the museum is to become a cultural attraction for the millions of visitors that come every year to the @entity52			0
@entity39 + 's cultural manager @entity53 says the city is the perfect place to locate a major photography museum because it 's retained its authenticity at the same time as becoming an economic and cultural player			1
" @entity1 inspires photographers , it is abuzz with @entity21 and worldwide creativity , and for all these reasons we thought is was useful to open it in this city , " he told @entity0			1
the museum already has a temporary home inside the ancient walls of @entity1 's @entity68 and has hosted exhibitions including one by five photographers from the @entity72 agency : @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			1
tricky subjects ironically for a city set to become an international photography hub -- and which looks so good on film -- taking photographs in @entity1 is n't always easy			1
many @entity21 , here more so than further south , do n't like to be photographed and they wo n't hesitate to make it known			0
it 's not impossible to capture beautiful moments			2
here are some tips on avoiding embarrassment : @entity90 is best the bigger the equipment is , the more noticeable the photographer			0
walking through narrow streets of the old medina with a bulky professional camera , a tripod and a bag full of lenses is the easiest way to spook potential subjects			2
modern compact cameras are lighter , more discreet and can often do a better job with street photography			0
being bold gets results in @entity1 , i sometimes ask people for permission to take their photo , explaining that it 's more an artistic approach than a journalistic one			1
then i just wait for this perfect moment when they forget i 'm there and get the photograph i want without disturbing anyone			0
so does staying hidden the complete opposite of the previous tip , but sometimes stolen moments are the most natural and the best			0
it 's not always possible to avoid being spotted by the people being photographed , but a polite attitude and a smile can work wonders			1
follow the light in addition to @entity1 's countless attractions , weather is one of the main reasons tourists visit the @entity133 -- and it 's definitely a plus for photographers			1
there are clear skies almost daily , meaning that when the sun is at its zenith , walks through the alleys of the old medina will be beautifully lit. not to mention the sunsets			0
the best spots whether the subject is a person a group or beautiful landscape , location is everything			0
it 's easy to get close to people in the main square , @entity153 , but photographers should n't be surprised if they get asked for money in exchange of their masterpiece -- this mostly applies to snake charmers and monkey trainers			0
the rooftops of cafes and restaurants surrounding this square offer commanding views of the marketplace and glorious sunsets			0
here are some of my favorite places : @entity171 ( northwest corner of the square ) : the service is n't five star , but the view over both sides of the square propels it to the top of the list			0
@entity183 ( @entity182 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity1 ; +212 0 524 42 42 42 ) has a rooftop terrace with a panoramic view over the city and the @entity189			1
@entity190 : this riverside road to the north of the city is another good place for sunsets , this time with silhouetted palm trees in the foreground			0
the old medina : best appreciated without a map since getting lost in the labyrinthine backstreets of @entity1 is the best way to escape tourist traps			2
place of the @entity202 ( @entity203 , @entity1 ) : still largely unknown by tourists , these seven towers , each topped by a tree , were built in 2005 in honor of @entity1 's seven patron saints			1
and finally ... one note of caution : taking photographs of government buildings is forbidden and can result in arrest			0
@entity214 is a @entity21 photographer , writer and director .			0

with strong sunlight and plenty of color , @entity1 is a photographer 's dream
in 2016 , the city will be home to the world 's largest photography exhibition
it 's *recommended* to work with a smaller , less *obvious* camera to avoid spooking local subjects
