after a week of demonstrations nationwide , as well as calls for justice and an uproar over hoodies on @entity5 , the focus of the @entity8 saga on saturday will once again return to the @entity10 city where it all began			1
thousands of activists are expected to turn out for a saturday morning march to the headquarters of the @entity15 , whose members have faced extensive criticism for not arresting the 17 - year - old @entity8 's shooter , @entity20			1
on february 26 , @entity20 has said , he killed @entity8 in self - defense in a gated community in that central @entity10 city			1
he told police that the teen punched him and slammed his head on the sidewalk before the fatal shooting , according to an @entity31 report that was later confirmed by @entity33 police			0
authorities have said @entity20 was not immediately charged because there were no grounds , at the outset , to disprove his account that he had acted to protect himself			2
yet critics say that @entity20 , who is @entity40 , deemed @entity8 " suspicious " and decided to follow him against the advice of a police dispatcher because the teen was black			1
shooting divides a community that sentiment is expected to be well represented at saturday 's march and subsequent rally			0
the participants include the president of the @entity40 advocacy group @entity51 , teachers union representatives and various @entity54 leaders			0
other notables will be the rev. @entity56 and the rev. @entity57 , both of whom have been regulars throughout the debate and in close contact with @entity8 's family			1
the late teenager 's parents are not expected to attend			0
an open letter on the @entity54 's website -- directed at @entity67 , the special prosecutor assigned to the case -- points to what it calls " evidence of racial bias , investigative mishaps , and the true nature of the circumstances surrounding @entity8 's killing ( that ) have shaken us to the core ... " however , nothing shakes us more than the knowledge that @entity8 's killer , @entity20 , remains free			1
" video : @entity20 in handcuffs the letter ends with a plea for @entity86 " to prosecute the case judiciously , and to passionately pursue justice			2
" @entity33 police chief @entity89 announced earlier this month that he was stepping down " temporarily " as head of the department amid the public uproar over the shooting			0
state 's attorney @entity94 , from @entity10 's 18th district , also stepped aside in the case			1
gov. @entity97 has appointed @entity86 as a special investigator , after which she said that her office could charge @entity20 , clear him or send the case to the grand jury			1
in an interview thursday with @entity105 's @entity104 , the shooter 's brother , @entity104 , questioned the competence of and the job done by @entity86 's office thus far			2
opinion : @entity8 's death more than teachable moment he cited leaks of details -- which have not been confirmed to have come from @entity86 or her office -- and described the account that his brother " chased a person " as " absolutely false			1
" " ms. @entity67 's investigation has been compromised , " the brother said			2
yet @entity10 attorney general @entity122 stood staunchly behind @entity86 , in an interview friday with @entity105 's @entity124			1
she noted that @entity97 appointed @entity86 after consulting with her			0
she is tough as nails			0
she is compassionate , " @entity122 said			0
" and if any leaks are coming out of this investigation , it is certainly not from @entity67 's office			0
" @entity122 added that she thought criticism of @entity86 -- both by those , like @entity104 , who support @entity20 and those calling for his prompt arrest -- " completely undermines the integrity of the investigation			2
" in depth : @entity105 peels back the layers she said that she 's spoken to @entity8 's parents , whom she called " amazing people , " as well as the family 's lawyers , whom she described as " friends of mine			1
" everyone involved , @entity122 said , would be best off if they " wait and let ( the investigation ) happen			0
" that means being patient in the face of fervent demands from activists that @entity20 be detained and charged as soon as possible , said the attorney general			1
" you never want to make an arrest too soon , " @entity122 said			0
" we need justice , but you never want to make an arrest without having all the answers			0
" while @entity20 has not spoken out about the case , his family members have taken their case public this week			1
besides the brother , @entity104 -- the shooter 's father -- told @entity170 tv station @entity169 that @entity8 " continued to beat @entity20 " and he said something to the effect of , " you 're going to die now			1
" what the witnesses are saying but on @entity177 affiliate @entity176 , @entity8 's brother @entity175 said he finds it " baffling how people ... just take ( @entity20 's ) word for it , as if that 's exactly what happened			1
" he was especially incredulous about his brother 's alleged threat to kill			2
" that does n't sound like my brother at all , " said @entity175 , a 21 - year - old student at @entity185			1
@entity10 law allows the use of deadly force anywhere a person feels a reasonable fear of death or serious injury			0
it has been cited in a number of justifiable homicide cases in the state			0
but as more information surfaces , the picture of what happened between @entity8 and @entity20 becomes more complicated			2
despite the twists and turns , @entity202 , @entity8 's mother , has said that she still has faith in authorities investigating her son 's case			2
" i feel confident that they 're going to do a thorough investigation , " she said			0
" we 're trying to be patient , even though it 's been over a month			0
we 're trying to be patient , and we 're trying to press on for justice			0

@entity175 says his brother , @entity8 , would never threaten to kill anybody
