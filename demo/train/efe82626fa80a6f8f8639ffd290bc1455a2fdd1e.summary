@entity0 -- it 's a position that @entity3 once called downright pathetic : that of a former president			0
in his post-presidency , @entity5 has plans to construct a presidential library and work on his memoirs			1
after all , the process of relinquishing the most powerful job in the world is n't an easy one , especially given the @entity16 public 's notoriously fleeting attention span and penchant for paying little heed to once - prominent political figures after they exit the public stage			0
as the days dwindle until president @entity5 joins what @entity23 called the " most exclusive trade union in the world , " the unpopular commander in chief recently declared that he 's more than ready to forgo the limelight			1
although ex-presidents in @entity3 ' day quickly descended into obscurity after their years in the @entity33 , today the transition away from serving as the leader of the free world is high - profile , potentially very lucrative and , above all , a difficult job in itself			1
this is especially true for @entity5 , historians and political observers say			2
he not only must oversee the construction of a presidential library and begin writing his memoirs , but he also must grapple with salvaging a legacy mired in the lowest presidential approval ratings in history			1
" the first year for every ex-president is really hard , " said @entity45 , a presidential historian at @entity46			0
" you have to raise all this money for your library , you 've got to build an organization , you have to write a huge memoir , your papers are in disarray , and you suddenly realize your mistakes because your pace slows down			0
" @entity5 has more than a month left in office , but planning for his post-presidential year began more than two years ago			2
in many ways , the process is in full swing			0
fundraising and planning for his presidential library , to be built on the campus of @entity64 in @entity65 , is well under way			0
the president has started interviews with high - profile journalists , by all accounts already trying to define his legacy			1
but as the president is set to begin his stint out of office , the exact path he will take remains unclear			0
@entity5 has expressed interest in writing a memoir and hitting the highly profitable lecture circuit , but experts say both pursuits could pose pitfalls			1
publishers , concerned the president 's slumping approval ratings could translate to less - than - stellar book sales , have reportedly been lukewarm about a @entity5 book deal			1
@entity5 has expressed interest in cataloguing 10 crises he 's faced , @entity45 said , but wary publishers are somewhat cold to that idea , perhaps concerned that a public still reeling from the country 's financial meltdown might not have an appetite for the president 's account of his own difficult times			1
@entity5 , like several of his predecessors , is also likely to embark on the business of making money -- and a lot of it -- off his status as a former occupant of the @entity105			1
the @entity106 have made more than $ 100 million in the eight years since the curtain closed on their @entity105 years , and @entity5 himself has said that his father earns $ 50,000 to $ 75,000 a speech			1
to be sure , profiting from their @entity105 years is a staple for modern ex-presidents : @entity113 capitalized on his accidental 2Â½ - year presidency by sitting on the board of several major corporations , and @entity117 caused a stir when he netted $ 2 million for a few brief speeches in @entity120 in 1989			1
but the public 's overwhelming disdain for the president may delay a speaking tour and @entity5 ascent to the corporate boardroom			2
" he is a president where people are expecting some kind of repair work , " said @entity127 , a professor of history and public affairs at @entity130			1
" if he just goes on the speaking circuit and focuses his time making huge money , that would only tarnish a presidency that only has a low approval rating			2
" instead , @entity5 is more likely to choose a similar post-presidential path , at least initially , as that of @entity144 , who also left the @entity105 with poor approval ratings , @entity127 said			1
instead of seeking to profit off his years in office , @entity144 became a globe - trotting humanitarian and was awarded the @entity149 in 2002 for his work promoting social and economic justice			2
in the process , @entity144 has rehabilitated his image and transformed a legacy that had seemed unsalvageable three decades ago			0
" what @entity144 showed is that you can be very active in your post-presidential years and help improve how people think of you as a leader and a policy maker , " @entity127 said			0
@entity5 and his handlers are mapping out this phase of the president 's @entity163 years			2
plans are well under way for a " @entity167 " that will aim to promote democracies abroad			0
the institute , where @entity5 is expected to play a significant role , is expected to be unaffiliated with an academic institution			2
its members are expected to be analysts whose views are in line with the neoconservative outlook that shaped the president 's approach to foreign policy			0
" this is going to be @entity5 vision			2
" @entity45 said of the institute			0
" @entity5 has never liked the academics , and this is a nonacademic institute aimed at cutting to the core of things : only pro-democracy foot soldiers who are green - lit by @entity5 and @entity188 are in the mix. " it 's under the auspices of this think tank that the president might try to improve his legacy , in hopes that @entity167 might reveal virtues in the foreign policy vision that led to the most defining decision of his presidency , the invasion of @entity201			1
" this president 's low approval rating is overwhelmingly connected to @entity201			0
it will rise and fall depending what turns out to be the history of that country and that part of the world , " said @entity204 , a former @entity205 aide and a scholar at the conservative @entity207			0
" that really is what his legacy for future historians is all about			0
