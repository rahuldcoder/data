-- like many voters on @entity2 , @entity3 and his family dutifully rose before sunrise and headed to the polls in @entity7 , @entity8 , to cast their votes			0
@entity3 , @entity10 and @entity11 voted as a family for @entity13 in their first presidential election this year			1
but this election was especially significant for @entity3 , wife @entity17 and son @entity11 , who were all voting for the first time			0
" as the first - time voter , it was emotionally remarkable to perform my civic duty , " said @entity3 , a @entity19 native who became a @entity21 citizen in 2005			1
" i felt great taking the ownership of this voting process that created a historic moment for the nation and the world			0
" as a family , the @entity30 represented two major groups from the bloc of first - time voters , which accounted for roughly 11 percent of this year 's electorate			1
@entity11 is a college student , and his parents , both in their 50s , are recent citizens			1
an overwhelming majority of first - time voters , including the @entity30 , voted for sen. @entity13 over sen. @entity41 by a margin of 69 to 31 percent , @entity0 exit polls show			1
for @entity3 , a business and economics professor at the @entity45 , it was an easy choice			0
he felt that @entity13 's campaign reflected a " paradigm shift " that would restore the @entity49 dream that had drawn @entity3 to the @entity21 as a post-graduate student in the 1980s			1
" i expect @entity13 will restore the @entity49 dream and create economic security by creating new jobs in new fields like alternative energy , science and math , global warming and health care			2
that is the only way economy can get back on track , " @entity3 said			0
@entity3 's views reflect those of first - time voters who were drawn to @entity13 for his pledges to restore the @entity21 dream			1
now , with @entity13 headed for the @entity67 , first - time voters are hoping he will stick to his campaign promises			1
@entity69 became a citizen in 1995 , but he was n't inspired to vote until now because of @entity21 's deteriorating image abroad			1
" this time , i felt it was very important to vote , because i saw where the country was heading , in a very opposite direction from the rest of world , " said @entity69 , who moved to the @entity74 , @entity73 , area from @entity75 with his parents in 1990			0
@entity69 said @entity13 campaigned on issues that were important to him : working with allies on security issues , energy concerns , civil rights issues like closing the @entity90 detention facility and withdrawing troops from @entity92			2
for young voters , discontent over the @entity92 war emerged as a key issue , according to @entity0 exit polls			2
" the first thing i want @entity13 to do is to get our men out of @entity92 ; that 's all that really matters to me right now , " @entity98 , a sophomore majoring in secondary education in @entity101 at @entity102 in @entity103 , wrote in an e-mail			1
" we have really spent a lot on war ; why not focus on our own economy ? " like many college students , @entity98 also considered the candidates ' positions on issues that affect her directly			1
as a deaf person , she looked for the candidates ' disability plans and could find one only for @entity120			0
@entity121 , a @entity122 senior who is studying social work , hopes @entity13 will make good on his promise to implement funding for social services so that she can do her job -- if she finds one			1
" a lot of families ca n't afford food and need food stamps and health care , even just child care so they can finish school or go to work , " said @entity121 , who volunteers with children at her local @entity129			0
" i 'm hoping he 'll start taking out troops and create more jobs , especially within social service agencies , because i 'm going to need a job when i get out of school			0
" about 66 percent of voters between the ages of 18 to 29 cast ballots for @entity13 , a number attributed to his campaign 's use of new media , including the @entity151 and mobile media			1
but equally inviting among young voters was his fresh perspective and direct appeals to them to become engaged in the process			0
" the fact that @entity13 appealed so much to the youth to make us feel like our voices count , they 've grown to idolize him			2
that 's what kind of sparked my interest			0
he really mobilized youth , " said @entity167 , a freshman at @entity168			0
for many new citizens struggling with @entity101 , the act of casting a vote was their own form of civic commitment			0
" when you do n't speak @entity101 , it 's difficult to be heard , but the person who votes speaks for himself and the community , " said @entity175 , a @entity177 living in @entity178 , @entity8 , who became a @entity21 citizen in january 2007			1
after becoming a citizen , @entity175 became active in the @entity8 - based community organization @entity187 , which helped register 1,111 voters in low - income neighborhoods throughout the state			1
@entity175 said that for minorities like her , @entity13 was a sympathetic voice who understood the pervasive effect of poverty , unemployment and lack of social services in their communities			2
" he talks about creating sources of employment and social programs , but he also talks about how the communities must help themselves , " said @entity175 , who plans to continue working for @entity187 to help bring about the changes @entity13 has promised			2
" to give a plate of food to the hungry does n't help , because where does the next meal come from ? @entity13 gives us hope for finding the tools to help ourselves			1
" then there were others who were dislodged from political apathy by the prospect of casting a historic ballot for the first @entity219 - @entity49 president			0
" i actually started paying attention because @entity13 was a black man running , but once i started listening , he started making sense to me , and i decided to get out there and vote , " said @entity220 , an @entity49 grocery store stocker and father of five from @entity223 , @entity224			2
those who voted for @entity41 are less optimistic about what an @entity13 presidency will do for them			2
" i hope he succeeds , simply because i care for our country too much , but i do n't really expect him to , " said @entity233 , a senior at @entity234 in @entity235 , @entity236			0
" more specifically , i 'm unsure as to which @entity13 will be inaugurated in january			2
will it be the more liberal @entity120 primary @entity13 , or will it be the more moderate general election @entity13 ? " @entity233 said in an e-mail to @entity0			0
" i firmly believe that @entity13 has the ability to be a successful president , but that depends entirely on his willingness to stick to his campaign promises and avoid the temptation that an extremely liberal congress will provide			0

first - time voters such as students , new citizens made up 11 percent of electorate
69 percent of new voters chose @entity13 based on platform of change
college students want @entity13 to end war , **improve** job market for them to enter
new citizens hope @entity13 will boost economy , **improve** @entity21 's image abroad
