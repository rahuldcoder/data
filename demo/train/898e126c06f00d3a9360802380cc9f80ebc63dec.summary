-- as an athlete , i enjoy competition -- but there is a battle happening off the field that is more important : the fight to end polio			1
this fight is personal to me			0
i grew up in @entity9 , where i contracted polio at the age of 3			1
it was tough being the only kid on the playground in a wheelchair			0
for years i watched the other kids play , and when i tried to participate , they moved away from me			0
thanks to the encouragement of my father , i persevered			0
after a lot of hard work and practice , i eventually regained full mobility in my right leg and have gone on to compete in track and field in the @entity26			1
no child should have to go through what i did , especially when we have a vaccine to prevent it			0
yet today , polio continues to cripple children in some parts of the world			1
polio is more than 99 % eliminated worldwide , and there are fewer cases than ever before			1
in 1988 , 125 countries were fighting polio , and more than 350,000 children contracted the disease each year			1
today , we have fewer than 200 cases , and polio remains endemic in just three countries : @entity9 , @entity45 and @entity46			1
as we commemorate @entity48 on wednesday , eradication is within reach			1
why polio has n't gone away yet this progress did not happen by accident			1
it happened because the global community launched an unprecedented effort called the @entity56 , a partnership that includes the @entity58 , @entity59 , the @entity60 , @entity61 and the @entity62			0
thanks to this initiative and the work of many others , we are closer than ever to shutting the door on polio			2
but we ca n't stop now			0
the last percent is always the toughest , and if we do n't finish the job , polio could return with a vengeance			2
according to @entity58 , if we do n't end polio now , more than 10 million children under the age of 5 could be paralyzed by the disease in the next 40 years			1
that 's a risk too big to take			0
we owe it to our own children -- and to all children -- to seize this moment and end this disabling disease			0
polio anywhere is a threat to children everywhere			2
our progress to date shows that when the world acts , we can achieve big things			0
that 's why world leaders came together last month at the @entity91 to reaffirm their commitment to ending polio and to issue an urgent call to fill a funding gap that threatens to undo the progress that has been made			2
the @entity98 's @entity97 campaign is carrying this message forward and empowering individual @entity100 to join the fight against polio			2
through @entity97 , @entity100 can raise awareness and funds to help the @entity91 immunize children in developing countries against polio and other diseases			2
@entity61 and others are doing amazing work delivering polio immunizations , including in hard - to - reach places where the fight against polio will be won or lost			1
we have a once - in - a - generation opportunity to make history and finally eradicate polio from our planet			2
each of us can make a difference this @entity48			0
to this very day , my mother gets tears in her eyes when she describes the moment she found out that i was paralyzed			0
together , we can wipe out polio and ensure that one day no parent has to share that same fate			0
opinion : do n't fall at the finish line in the race to eradicate polio the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity131 .			1
