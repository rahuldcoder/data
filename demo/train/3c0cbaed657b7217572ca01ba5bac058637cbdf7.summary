@entity0 , @entity1 -- on a recent trip to @entity5 , i had barely made my way down the concourse and arrived at the immigration processing area when i got stumped			1
signs pointed the way to two lines : one for " @entity12 " ( " @entity13 " ) , another for " @entity15 " ( " foreigners			1
" ) i stood there for a few seconds , unsure of where to go			0
growing up in @entity1 , i had been called a " @entity13 " my entire life			1
it 's ethnic shorthand in the same way that my friends in @entity24 refer to themselves as " @entity25 " or my friends in @entity27 describe themselves as " @entity28			0
" later , i settled on " @entity29			0
" but , this was @entity5			2
and , in the homeland of my grandfather , there was no need for shorthand or hyphens			0
i was simply an @entity37			2
i speak @entity38 , good enough to handle either end of an interview in that language			0
but i do n't have the vocabulary of a native , and i ca n't shake my @entity37 accent			2
so i took my @entity37 passport and got in the line for @entity15			2
i thought about that moment this week when @entity13 president - elect @entity47 visited the @entity48 to meet with president @entity49			1
on the agenda , as usual , when the leaders of these two countries meet : immigration , drugs and trade			0
news : @entity5 's new leader measured against old party @entity47 was also eager to talk about the growth of the @entity13 economy , which is one reason that @entity13 are now just as likely to stay in @entity5 as venture to the @entity37			1
he wants to partner with the @entity37 and @entity63 , and create a @entity65 - style trading bloc in @entity66			1
and @entity47 vowed to continue @entity5 's war against the drug cartels , even though he offered no specifics			2
for @entity5 , the relationship with the @entity37 is complicated and filled with hard feelings			1
most @entity37 probably never give a thought to the fact that , in 1848 , the @entity37 invaded @entity5 and forced its leaders to sign over half their territory at the point of rifle			1
but for @entity13 , who think in terms of centuries , not minutes , the reminders are everywhere			2
so the minute that a @entity37 official says anything the least bit critical of @entity5 , you start hearing -- in the @entity13 press , and among the elites -- complaints about how the @entity37 are encroaching upon their neighbor 's sovereignty			1
and the children of @entity91 go on the warpath			0
and yet , for @entity5 , the really challenging relationship is with the more than 35 million @entity29 living in the @entity37			1
you want to talk about hard feelings ? there is plenty			0
@entity5 has winners and losers , people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it does n't			1
the only reason you have so many people of @entity13 ancestry living in cities like @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 or @entity111 is because , at some point in our family tree , there was a person , maybe a parent or grandparent , who was shut out from opportunity in @entity5 and had to go north			1
and more often than not , that person fit a profile -- dark skin , little education , from a poor village , etc. we 're their offspring , and we 're loyal to them			0
and even though we may now be living the @entity128 , having gone to good schools and taken good jobs , we can never lose sight of the fact that it 's the @entity128 we 're living , and not the @entity13 one			2
our identity might sometimes be fuzzy , but our loyalty is clear			0
it 's to the @entity37			2
besides , we 're aware that many of the elite @entity13 in the ruling class do n't like us			2
they see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us as inferior stock that is n't sufficiently @entity13			2
our @entity38 will never be good enough , our ties to @entity5 never strong enough			2
our existence is , as they see it , all about failure			0
if our families had n't failed in @entity5 , they would n't have left			1
and we would n't now find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain , living well in the @entity37 but lost souls nonetheless			0
my wife , who was born in @entity155 and came to the @entity37 legally as a child , reminds me that there is friction between @entity13 and @entity13 - @entity37 because @entity13 have a firmer grasp of who they are and @entity13 - @entity37 resent that			1
while she 's a @entity37 citizen , she sees herself as a part of two countries			0
meanwhile , many @entity13 - @entity37 i know do n't feel like they 're a part of either			1
we love listening to the @entity13 band , @entity165 , but also to @entity166			0
you get the best of both worlds , but you 're rooted in neither			0
in @entity5 , we 're seen as @entity37			1
and in the @entity37 , we 're considered @entity13			1
now , to complicate the relationship even further , as i learned during my trip , some @entity13 leaders and parts of the intelligentsia want to reconnect with the @entity176			0
they want to put @entity13 - @entity37 to work as makeshift " ambassadors " for @entity5 , representing its interest in the @entity37			1
we would tell our fellow @entity37 what a great country this is to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with @entity5			1
that 's not going to happen			0
and , with income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence , many of us are not so sure that it is a great country			0
i 'm afraid you 're on your own , amigos			0
if at least some @entity13 are n't yet ready to forgive the @entity37 for how it treated @entity5 a century and a half ago , then they have to accept the fact that some @entity13 - @entity37 still hold a grudge for how their family members were treated much more recently than that			1
maybe we 're more " @entity13 " than i thought			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			0

@entity201 : long , troubled *history* divides @entity13 , @entity13 - @entity37
he says many were forced to leave @entity5 because of the lack of opportunities there
@entity13 tend to fault those who left ; they remind @entity13 of hard times , he says
@entity201 says @entity13 - @entity37 are caught between two worlds
