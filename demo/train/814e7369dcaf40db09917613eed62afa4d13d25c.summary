@entity1 , @entity0 -- a veteran of over 20 years of mountain climbing , @entity3 has been in some pretty tight scrapes			1
soldier mountaineer @entity3 on @entity7			1
his team tried to summit via the mountain 's notorious @entity10 in 2006			1
he and his climbing partner once watched in terror as a huge avalanche careered down a @entity16 mountainside straight for them			0
they were miraculously spared when the wall of snow parted on either side of the promontory where they were standing at a distance of just 50 meters			0
on another occasion he spent an agonizing night hanging precariously over a 3,000 - foot ( 900 meter ) drop during an electrical storm in the @entity28			2
he estimates he was electrocuted " half a dozen times " during the course of the night			0
faced with the fearsome power of nature mountaineers like @entity3 rely on one indispensable ally -- other mountaineers			1
teamwork is essential in climbing			0
the first successful ascent of @entity7 was as much about the bond of trust that existed between modest @entity41 sir @entity40 and his diminutive sherpa , @entity42 , as their individual talents			1
to illustrate this point , when @entity3 -- a warrant officer in the @entity46 -- was compiling a team of soldiers to attempt an ascent of @entity7 's notorious @entity10 the first quality he and the rest of the selection panel looked for was not climbing expertise , but compatibility			1
" a lot of people think that when you go and do something like that , you immediately look for all the best climbers in the army , " he says			2
" but what we based our selection process on , compatibility was first			0
" of course , all team sports rely upon a strong dynamic between the individual members			0
but there can be few disciplines in which the stakes are as high as in mountain climbing , where your life often literally rests in someone else 's hands			2
@entity3 , 40 , led the expedition of 21 army mountaineers to @entity7 's @entity10 two years ago			1
it was a daunting undertaking			0
of over 2,200 climbers who have made it to the top of the world 's tallest peak since it was first conquered , only 19 have done so via this route			2
the ridge is rarely attempted because of its steepness and because its position leaves it exposed to high winds and the risk of avalanche			0
the army 's summit attempt took three and half years in the planning and preparation and was the subject of a documentary , ' @entity7 : man v mountain			1
' much of this build - up involved establishing strong bonds between team members			0
practice climbs , social events and corporate - style teambuilding days were all employed to try to instil an atmosphere of mutual trust within the group			0
an essential factor on a mountain as significant as @entity7 , @entity3 says			1
" you are massively wrapped up in emotions there because you 've spent three and a half years preparing for it , " says @entity3 , who now runs his own outdoor events company in the @entity28			1
the prestige of getting to the top of @entity7 can sometimes blur a climber 's moral judgement , leading to acts of single - mindedness that border on the downright callous			1
during the same season as @entity3 's army expedition , @entity126 , a 34 - year - old @entity123 climber died of cold , exhaustion and lack of oxygen on his descent from the summit			1
as details of @entity126 's death became public it emerged that 40 climbers had passed him , making no attempt to save the stricken climber as he lay stranded in the scant shelter of a rock alcove on the mountain 's northeast ridge			1
the incident drew much soul - searching in the mountaineering world , with sir @entity40 complaining to @entity146 's @entity145 of the " horrifying " attitudes it revealed			0
" ( on @entity7 ) a lot of people are out for themselves completely , " says @entity3			1
he says this selfish streak is exacerbated by the fast turnover of commercial climbing expeditions , which often meet for the first time just a couple of weeks before a summit attempt , meaning there is little opportunity to build team morale			2
by contrast , among @entity3 's army mountaineers the needs of the group were always put before personal ambition			1
he gives an example : " as we went for the summit there were a number of support teams , one of whose job it was to break trail from base camp right the way up to 7,500 metres , clambering through two foot of snow			0
" each step you take at those altitudes is absolutely horrendous			0
there 's a clip in the documentary of one of the lads breaking trail , every step up to his knees in snow , and you hear him say : ' well , this is our job so we 've got to get on with it			0
' " a brilliant demonstration of teamwork			0
" the biggest test of this togetherness came when @entity3 was left the unenviable task of telling his team of ambitious young soldiers he was abandoning the summit attempt because of a high risk of avalanches			1
" two or three of the guys were pretty pissed off , to be honest			0
" instead of getting wrapped up in emotions -- because @entity7 is a very emotional place -- i looked at it in very black and white terms			2
i could n't risk sending my team up the mountain with that kind of real and present danger involved			2
" this clear - headed thinking meant his team braved one of the most dangerous climbs in the world and made it back down again , together .			2

army officer @entity3 *recruited* a team of 21 soldiers to @entity223
the 2006 attempt was via the mountain 's notoriously dangerous @entity10
they spent over three years preparing by building *cameraderie* and team spirit
@entity3 says personal ambition can sometimes get the better of climbers on @entity7
