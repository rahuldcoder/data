the 1 - 0 win lifts @entity93 above @entity102 to fourth in the table with 36 points , but the @entity105 can regain fourth if they beat @entity106 on sunday			1
@entity108 's late winner at @entity109 gave @entity110 some temporary respite from his troubled tenure at @entity113 as the @entity114 overcame @entity115 2 - 1			1
@entity116 headed @entity115 into a 1 - 0 lead just before half - time , but back came @entity113 as @entity119 netted after receiving an exquisite through ball from @entity121 in the 49th minute			1
@entity113 then proceeded to dominate the second half but had to wait until the second minute of injury time before @entity108 -- who replaced @entity125 in the 82nd minute -- tapped in to score -- from what looked like an offside position -- his first @entity129 goal since joining from @entity102 in the summer			2
@entity113 move up to ninth place with 25 points while @entity115 slip to seventh			2
@entity133 hauled themselves off the bottom of the table with a 2 - 0 win over @entity137 at @entity138			1
@entity137 defender @entity139 bundled the ball into his own net in the 51st minute to hand the @entity133 the lead , and striker @entity143 made sure of the three points for @entity146 's men 11 minutes from time with a low drive past @entity149 in the @entity137 goal			1
the victory lifts @entity133 to 15th in the table with 20 points			2
