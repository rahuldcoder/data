@entity1 's lawmakers voted thursday to authorize military force against the islamic state terror group in @entity4 and @entity5 , opening the door to cooperation with a @entity9 - led coalition going after @entity10 as its fighters laid siege to towns just south of the @entity1 border			1
the @entity15 voted 298 - 98 to not only to let the country 's military leave its borders to go after @entity10 and other terror groups , but also allow foreign troops to launch operations from @entity1			1
the authorization takes effect saturday			0
it is a big shift for @entity1 , a @entity26 member , which until now offered only tacit support to a @entity9 - led coalition of about 40 nations going after @entity10 in @entity5 and @entity4 in various capacities			1
the mood of @entity1 's leaders changed in recent days , with @entity10 on the nation 's doorstep and tens of thousands fleeing across its border			1
the prime minister asked @entity15 to consider military action this week , submitting a motion declaring that @entity1 was seriously threatened by the chaos in @entity4 and @entity5 , where @entity10 has captured land and is trying to establish an @entity43 caliphate			2
for months , @entity10 has been advancing , capturing portions of northern and eastern @entity4 and western and northern @entity5 for what it says is its new @entity43 state , or caliphate			0
the fighting has only intensified in the region in recent days , with @entity10 advancing and nearly surrounding the @entity4 @entity51 city of @entity52 , known in @entity53 as @entity54 , just a few miles from the border with @entity1			1
if @entity10 takes @entity52 , it will control a complete swath of land from its self - declared capital of @entity59 on the @entity60 to the @entity1 border , more than 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) away			1
residents told to evacuate residents in @entity52 were ordered to evacuate thursday by the local defense force , the @entity63 ( @entity64 ) , as @entity10 advanced on three fronts , seizing a number of villages just outside the city , @entity69 , a media activist in the city , told @entity73			1
@entity69 said he was waiting at the border at @entity75 with approximately 3,000 people waiting to cross into @entity1			0
@entity77 , a university student , said he had made it across the border after waiting with what he said were the last civilians to leave @entity52			1
only fighters trying to defend the city now remain , he said , but it is surrounded by @entity10 and they face a dire situation			2
@entity86 , a @entity64 fighter , said @entity52 had now been declared a military zone by the @entity51 force 's leaders			1
@entity10 has @entity52 surrounded from three sides and its fighters are positioned very close to the city , he said			1
@entity51 snipers have taken up positions on high ground around the city but can expect @entity10 shelling to try to dislodge them , he said			1
the @entity64 is now expecting @entity10 to try to enter the city itself , @entity86 said , adding that guerrilla warfare is the best chance for the defenders of @entity52 because they hold the city and know it well			1
' we are not afraid to die ' another @entity64 fighter who gave only his first name , @entity106 , said from @entity52 that the @entity51 forces were determined to fight on			1
" @entity10 has surrounded us but we will fight , we are keeping our morale high , " he said			2
" we know , we have also seen , what @entity10 is capable of , what brutality they can do			0
... we know what they can do but we are not afraid to die , we are not afraid to fight			0
we know what will happen if @entity10 takes over our town and what they will do to us			0
" the fighters will resist neighborhood by neighborhood , he said			0
" our fight is not just for the @entity51 , it is a fight for all of humanity			2
when people are getting their heads chopped off and tossed aside like animals , it is a duty to fight			0
" the @entity128 , a @entity129 - based monitoring group , said thursday that clashes had been reported between @entity64 and @entity10 fighters only a few hundred yards from the east and southeast of the city			1
@entity10 militants have seized more than 350 villages in the past 16 days and displaced no fewer than 300,000 people from @entity52 and the surrounding countryside , it said			2
many have taken to social media to ask why there has been seemingly little attention by the @entity9 and its coalition partners paid to helping the @entity51 fighters in @entity52 hold off @entity10			1
on @entity146 , people are using hashtags # @entity147 and # @entity149 as part of an effort to raise the question			0
there was at least one airstrike near @entity52 on thursday by the coalition , according to the @entity9 military			1
the strike targeted an @entity10 checkpoint near the town , the military said			2
@entity1 's decision on military action came a day after newly appointed @entity26 chief @entity163 stressed at his first news conference that the defense alliance was committed to protecting @entity1 if it comes under attack			0
special forces deployed a possible threat to an ancient tomb -- located in @entity4 but considered a @entity1 enclave -- also appeared to be a factor in @entity1 's decision to approve going after @entity10			2
reports had emerged that @entity10 surrounded the tomb of the grandfather of the founder of the @entity177			0
president @entity178 has dismissed reports that @entity10 had surrounded the site			0
but the debate in @entity15 mentioned increasing security risks to the white marble mausoleum			0
as part of the @entity184 in 1921 , which ended the @entity186 , @entity1 was allowed to keep the tomb despite its location in @entity4 , to place guards at it and to raise a @entity1 flag over it			0
opinion : will @entity1 boots on ground really defeat @entity10 ? there have been conflicting reports in recent days about what has happened at the tomb and its guards , with some claims emerging that @entity10 fighters briefly took the guards captive			1
it has also been widely reported that @entity10 has had the tomb surrounded for months			0
so valued is the tomb said to contain the remains of @entity205 -- grandfather of @entity207 , the founder of the @entity177 -- that @entity1 deployed special forces soldiers in march when @entity10 began to take villages and towns surrounding the tomb			0
@entity212 : ' important moment ' for @entity215 coalition @entity217 report details abuses while @entity1 approved the use of military action against @entity10 , a new @entity217 report outlined " a staggering array " of human rights abuses committed by @entity10 in @entity5 over a nine - week period , including executions , killings , rape and the desecration of religious sites			2
the report documents " acts of violence of an increasingly sectarian nature " by @entity10 and associated armed groups and says their abuses appear to be widespread and systematic			0
from women reportedly being shot in the head for refusing to treat @entity10 fighters , to the execution of @entity241 who refused to swear allegiance to @entity10 , to the suicide bombing of a @entity246 mosque , it 's a litany of horrors			1
produced jointly by the @entity250 and the @entity251 , the report covers the period from july 6 to september 10 , when @entity10 was advancing across a swath of northern @entity5			0
the abuses " include attacks directly targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure , executions and other targeted killings of civilians , abductions , rape and other forms of sexual and physical violence perpetrated against women and children , forced recruitment of children , destruction or desecration of places of religious or cultural significance , wanton destruction and looting of property , and denial of fundamental freedoms , " the report said			0
@entity279 exempts @entity10 strikes from civilian casualty guidelines			2

coalition airstrikes targeted @entity10 near @entity52 , @entity9 military says
strikes come as *criticism* *mounts* about the coalition *response* to @entity52 's *plight*
residents ordered to leave as @entity10 fighters advance on @entity52 , flee across border
@entity51 fighter says @entity52 is now a military zone , defenders will fight in the streets
