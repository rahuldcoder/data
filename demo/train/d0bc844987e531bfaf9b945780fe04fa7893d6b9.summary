-- record breaking wicketkeeper @entity4 's enforced retirement is a " huge loss " for @entity7 cricket , its former chief @entity1 told @entity0 wednesday			1
@entity4 was the victim of a freak accident while playing for the @entity7 tourists in @entity10 against county side @entity11 as splinters from a bail left him with a serious eye injury			1
the 35 - year - old @entity4 was set to be a key figure for the @entity16 in their upcoming series against @entity6 's top ranked team in @entity10 , but has been left in his own words with an " uncertain recovery " after emergency surgery on his left eye			1
@entity1 , who was in charge of @entity7 cricket when @entity4 first came to prominence in 1997 , paid his own tribute			1
" a fierce competitor , very determined , always playing to win			0
i would call him as a terrific pressure player , " he said			0
" he seemed to rise to the occasion , whenever @entity31 got into trouble , " @entity1 added			2
@entity4 averaged just over 30 with the bat with five test centuries , but his work behind the stumps set new milestones			1
he has a record number of 555 dismissals in tests and 999 in all forms of international cricket , a tantalizing one short of the thousand mark			0
he also played a record number of tests at 147 for a wicketkeeper			0
many of them were during the career of former @entity7 paceman @entity50 , the pair combining to send many batsmen back to the pavilion			0
" i think special mention should be made of the role that he played in the ultimate success of @entity50 , " said @entity1			0
" there 's no question , speaking to @entity60 on many occasions that @entity4 had a very profound beneficial effect on his career as a mentor , to guide him , to give him the benefit of his experience as @entity67 became an international budding star for @entity31			2
" @entity4 had an inspirational effect on all his teammates and tributes have flooded in since his career was cut short in such unfortunate fashion			0
@entity1 , himself a former @entity6 star , said it was likely @entity76 would take his place behind the stumps for the series against @entity10 which starts next week			1
@entity80 , 31 , has also been drafted into the squad as a replacement			0
but @entity1 said @entity4 would be tough to replace in the short term			2
" it 's a huge loss for @entity7 cricket , he 's had a most distinguished career in cricket for his country and he will certainly go down as one of our greatest ever cricketers			1
