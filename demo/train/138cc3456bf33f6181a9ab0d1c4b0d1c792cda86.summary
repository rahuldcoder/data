-- @entity1 paid the ultimate price for failing to deliver trophies at @entity4 last season , being sacked by the @entity8 club 's billionaire owner @entity6 just hours after a defeat on the final day			1
the @entity10 is determined to avoid a similar fate at @entity12 by guiding the big - spending @entity14 club back into the @entity15 -- a competition where success proves ever elusive for @entity6 -- for the first time since 2004			1
@entity1 replaced the sacked @entity19 at the @entity20 in december , with @entity12 sitting top of @entity14 's @entity22			1
his appointment has been just one of many changes aimed at boosting the club 's profile since the @entity28 became @entity12 's majority shareholder in may 2011			2
the 52 - year - old inherited an expensively - assembled squad including @entity33 playmaker @entity32 , who signed from @entity10 's @entity34 for a @entity14 record transfer fee			1
" the aim is to play the @entity15 next year , " @entity1 , who won @entity38 club football 's biggest prize as a player and coach with @entity41 , told @entity0			1
" i found the club at the top of the league and so i have to try to do the best to keep the club at the top of the league until the end of the season			0
but the aim is to play in the @entity15			0
" @entity1 fell out of favor at @entity53 after failing to follow up the glory of his first season in charge , when he oversaw @entity4 's first @entity58 and @entity59 double			2
after leading the @entity60 to second place in the league , he was axed in favor of one of football 's rising stars -- former @entity68 coach @entity67			2
the 34 - year - old is now himself in danger of losing his job , having overseen @entity4 's worst run of results since @entity6 took charge in 2004 , and is reportedly facing a player revolt over his team selections			0
the @entity60 are outside the qualification spots for next year 's @entity15 , and their hopes in this season 's competition hang by a thread after losing 3 - 1 in the first leg of the last - 16 tie away to @entity84 on tuesday			0
villas - @entity67 was heavily criticized for starting with experienced @entity86 duo of @entity87 and @entity88 and @entity90 's @entity89 on the subs ' bench in @entity93 -- players who were key figures during @entity1 's time at @entity4			1
" i think the problem at @entity4 was that they tried to change something , to have a team younger , to give less matches to the most important players @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity102 , " @entity1 said			1
" but i think that this change needed time because it is very difficult to substitute players like @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity102 because they are the players in @entity4			0
" @entity1 's coaching staff at @entity12 includes former @entity4 midfielder @entity106 , who won two @entity58 titles in @entity108 under coach @entity109 before moving to the @entity14 capital in 2008			1
" it makes me sad when i see @entity4 like this , " the 39 - year - old said			0
" in a team , you ca n't change five or six players			0
" now @entity4 lose a lot with a lot of experienced players on the bench			0
" fifth - placed @entity4 will seek to end a run of five games without a win in all competitions in the league match against @entity128 on saturday , while @entity22 leaders @entity12 travel to sixth - placed @entity131 with a one - point advantage over @entity133 .			2

@entity1 says he has to deliver @entity15 football at @entity12
the former @entity4 and @entity41 boss has been in @entity14 since december
the @entity10 say @entity67 has tried to change too much at @entity4
former @entity4 midfielder @entity141 says the situation at the club is " sad "
