-- bad weather is keeping @entity3 's @entity2 and a team of @entity3 veterans stranded in @entity6 , their take - off point to @entity8 where they will race @entity11 and @entity12 teams on a trek to the @entity14			1
@entity17 actor and " @entity18 " star @entity15 is an honorary member of the @entity11 team , while @entity20 , perhaps best known for his role as @entity22 in " the wire , " joins veterans wounded in combat from the @entity12 nations of @entity27 and @entity28			1
the seven - person teams also include a guide and mentor			1
they are trekking more than 200 miles ( 322 kilometers ) across @entity8 , in temperatures as low as -35 degrees @entity34 ) , to raise money for the charity walking with @entity37			1
the three teams left @entity39 for @entity40 on sunday , and had been due to fly to @entity8 's @entity41 on tuesday , but a polar storm has kept them grounded			1
" at the moment , they 're just waiting , " a @entity46 spokesperson told @entity0			0
" they 're managing to do a bit of training , hiking up @entity50 and around @entity40			2
" the spokesperson said their actual departure date would not be confirmed until the weather had cleared			0
once the teams arrive at @entity56 , they 'll have three days of acclimatization before setting off on the trek , which is expected to take about 16 days			2
the teams will be pulling pulks -- or snow sleds -- containing all their food and equipment , which will weigh about 70 kilograms ( 154 pounds ) at the start of the trip , @entity59 said			0
@entity2 is a patron of walking with @entity37 , a cause close to the prince 's heart			1
" they 're going to achieve something quite remarkable and in doing so will prove to everybody else that even when you 've lost a leg , you 've lost an arm or whatever the illness may be , that you can achieve pretty much anything if you put your mind to it , " he said at the official departure in @entity39 last week			0
despite his royal upbringing , it 's the prince 's role as a solider that has already won him praise from his fellow teammates and rivals			0
" he 's laid back , we 're not scared to have him around , he 's just another soldier along with the rest of us , " says sgt. @entity89 , from the @entity11 team			0
an army helicopter pilot who has served multiple tours in @entity95 , @entity2 has had plenty of training for the big race			1
back in 2011 , he spent time training for a walking with the wounded expedition to the @entity101 , which saw him diving into the freezing waters of the @entity104			2
but he had to withdraw from that expedition early to attend the wedding of his brother			0
more recently , @entity2 traveled to @entity107 for training and even spent 24 hours in an industrial freezer in preparation			2
but will it be enough ? the winning team is expected to cross the finish line in time to have @entity113 back home .			0
