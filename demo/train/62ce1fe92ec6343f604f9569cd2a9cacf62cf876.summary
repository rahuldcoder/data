-- @entity1 is getting used to life as @entity4 's lone racer			1
the four - time world champion jokes that he has become something of a ' sunday driver ' -- it 's just that he irritates those on the road behind him by being too quick instead of being proverbially slow behind the wheel			0
" it is a sunday afternoon drive , " he mused to @entity0 after winning the penultimate race of the season in @entity15 , @entity16			1
" but not in that regard			0
" along with his faithful @entity20 steed , @entity1 has powered to four straight world championships and polished off a record - equaling nine consecutive race wins at the season ending @entity26 @entity25			1
even more mind boggling , is the fact that he has won at least three of those races 30 seconds ahead of the next car -- an enormous margin by the sport 's modern standards			1
when it was pointed out at the @entity36 @entity25 that the reigning world champion had won by a measly 6.2 seconds , he joked that perhaps the watching world was disappointed that he had not put his foot down			0
class of one for the sport 's global audience of half a billion viewers and those watching from rival team garages , it is , of course , no joke			0
@entity1 probably could have injected a turn of pace @entity51 would have been proud of if he wanted to and won by a country mile			1
" we just wanted to make sure there was plenty available , " @entity20 team boss @entity54 agreed after the @entity15 race			1
despite being surrounded by a field of drivers that includes four world champions , @entity1 has effectively been racing himself			2
so how does it feel to be driving in a class of one ? " it 's not as if i 've been getting bored , " the 26 - year - old @entity66 racer deadpanned			1
even the best drivers in the world have to get the basics of motor racing right -- making a clean start , handling the seesawing balance of the car as it eats up fuel and managing the life of the tires to time the pit stops and maintain , or gain , an advantage over your rivals			0
" obviously i 've quite a lot to do , " @entity1 explained			2
" first of all , i have to match their pace			0
obviously when they do come closer it 's not the best feeling because you want the gap to increase always			0
" certainly it 's a great feeling when you do pull away , and then it 's about pacing yourself , pacing yourself to get the range , to look after the tires etc. " there are a lot of things going on but also it 's a nice feeling to have a little bit of a gap because you can take it a little bit easier in some crucial places , to look after the tires and benefit from that , especially later on in the stint			0
" overall , you do tend to have quite a bit of work in the car			0
" team orders @entity1 has won 13 races in 2013 but not all of them have been at a canter			1
the 26 - year - old caused a stink when he ignored team orders to snatch victory from his @entity20 team mate @entity119 in @entity120			2
then in @entity66 he fended off the @entity122 drivers while in @entity123 , @entity1 clawed back victory , again from @entity119 , on tire strategy			2
the 10 other race victories ? well , they can be summed up by a single word -- dominance			0
there have been signs that perhaps @entity1 , the lone racer , has been finding other ways to keep himself busy in the car			1
for one thing , the @entity66 claimed the @entity135 award for setting the highest number of fastest laps during the races in a single season			0
in 2013 , @entity1 set the fastest lap seven times -- and yes , there is actual silverware to add to his bursting trophy cabinet			1
there have also been hints that @entity1 has been amusing himself by testing the limits of his @entity20 team , as he pushes the limits of the car			1
his level - headed race engineer @entity151 has often had to be the voice of reason on the pit - to - car radio warning @entity1 to be patient , not to abuse the tires and to focus on " distance not speed			1
" even team boss @entity54 put on his best parental voice when he tried to persuade an impatient @entity159 not to pass @entity119 for the victory in @entity120 , saying : " this is silly , @entity162			0
" does @entity54 agree , i asked him at the @entity15 race , that @entity1 has had to find new ways of testing himself by pushing the limits of his car and the team when he is able to win races so easily ? " what are you trying to say ; that he 'd like to go for it a bit more ? " @entity54 responded			1
" of course , @entity162 's very fixated on the fastest lap record , and he 'd be enormously p * * * * d off if he did n't get that trophy , " he continued , with a dash of tongue in cheek humor			2
" his enthusiasm runs away with him at times , i keep telling @entity181 ' ok now you can slow him down			0
' " @entity54 did , however , add that @entity1 was equally comfortable notching up victories out in front or scrapping it out in a close fight with his peers			2
" he enjoys competing , he enjoys winning and he 'll do the best that he can in the circumstances , if that means going wheel to wheel with somebody he 'll get satisfaction out of both			0
" it 's a question of managing the race			2
we 've seen it with him so many times -- he 's incredibly good at that			0
" those racing behind the virtually untouchable @entity66 can also appreciate what @entity1 has been able to achieve with car designer @entity204 's peerless @entity20 at his fingertips			1
era of dominance @entity209 ' racer @entity208 , the 2008 world champion , told @entity0 he could barely remember winning a race by a clear 30 seconds -- although he did win a wet @entity211 @entity25 in his championship - winning year with @entity213 by more than a minute			1
" in @entity4 it 's always five seconds or maybe 10 maximum , " @entity208 explained , when considering what it must have been like for @entity1 to win races so dominantly in 2013			1
" when you have that kind of gap you can just cruise ; when you 're that much faster than everyone you can just cruise , you 've got no traffic , you 've got time to pit , no - one in front of you -- it 's really easy			2
" when you have that time in the bag you do n't make mistakes because you do n't have to push to the limit			0
" you can control it more and be more at ease and have more time to think about things			0
it 's a much , much different position to be in than fighting in the midfield			0
" @entity208 , alongside fellow world champions @entity237 , @entity239 and @entity240 , publicly refused to declare the sport as boring under @entity1 's era of dominance			1
but racing drivers have egos and inside they must privately acknowledge a gnawing sense of frustration that they have been fighting this season for the title of ' best of the rest '			2
major rule changes loom large on the horizon in 2014 -- it 's a chance for @entity4 to press the reset button			1
@entity1 may have raced off into the sunset as a lone racer in 2013 but next season he could find himself reunited with a posse of fierce racing rivals			1
for now , the achievements of his record season are still sinking in			2
" it is very , very difficult for me to realize what we have achieved again , " @entity1 said as he faced the media for the final time at @entity26 's season finale			1
" i 'm actually quite sad that this season comes to an end			0
hopefully one day , when i 've got less hair and i 'm chubby then it 's something nice to look back to			0

@entity1 won 13 of the 19 grands prix in the 2013 @entity4 season
@entity20 racer *wrapped* up a fourth straight title and equaled record for nine straight race wins
@entity208 says @entity1 " can just cruise " to wins ; @entity1 says he is not bored by winning
new rules changes coming in 2014 could halt @entity1 and @entity20 's winning streak
