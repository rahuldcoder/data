-- travel back in time with me to 1988 : @entity4 was blasting onto the music scene , @entity3 turned in an award - winning performance in @entity8 , and @entity9 coined the now - famous tag line , " @entity11			0
" but the year also brought a cultural touchstone with much deeper significance : the first @entity12			1
the importance of such a day -- to be held annually on december 1st -- could not be understated , particularly at a time when the disease was still widely misunderstood , and a diagnosis often meant a death sentence			0
twenty - five years on , it is difficult to imagine a world without @entity12 ( or without @entity21 , for that matter )			1
but in the quarter century since the first @entity12 , much has changedâ € ” so much so , in fact , that leaders have begun to call for " @entity25 of @entity21 , " a global tipping point when the number of people newly infected with @entity29 is surpassed by the number of people newly offered treatment			1
a new study released by @entity34 this week demonstrates just how far we 've come , and suggests that if current rates of progress continue , the world will reach " @entity39 " as early as 2015			0
reaching this milestone would have been unimaginable just a few years ago , and is testament to the immense global effort and impressive new science that has emerged , particularly in the last decade			0
that acceleration has also been fueled by the simple fact that aids treatment now works better , and costs far less			1
in 1988 , the only drug available to treat @entity29 / @entity21 was @entity47 ; it was not hugely effective , and it cost as much as a car			1
today , for the price of an @entity51 -- less than a dollar a day -- combination antiretroviral treatment allows @entity29 - positive individuals to not only stay alive , but live long and productive lives			1
the progress we 've made also means that the language we use to describe the @entity58 needs a refresh			1
in particular , one 's report stresses that it 's time to retire the phrase " @entity64			0
" of course , this does n't mean the disease has disappeared from the continent , but it does mean that @entity69 countries have made widely divergent progress , and that a one - size - fits - all approach no longer makes sense			1
in fact , 16 @entity69 countries have already achieved @entity25 of @entity21			1
countries like @entity76 , @entity77 , and @entity78 are leading the way , deftly combining their own domestic health financing and planning with donor aid to achieve real impact			0
political leadership has also been important in elevating @entity21 as a priority issue on the national agenda , supported ( and sometimes pushed ) by dynamic civil society organizations on the ground			2
it 's important that we celebrate all of this progress , and honor those who have worked so hard to make it happen			0
but the work is far from over , and in many ways , the @entity21 fight today is struggling precisely because of its own success			1
because it is no longer perceived as an emergency , but rather a chronic and manageable disease , the fight has lost some of its political momentum and funding has not grown to match the global need			0
@entity104 estimates that the funding needed to fight @entity21 is still at least $ 3 - 5 billion short each year			1
with a few exceptions , donor funding for @entity21 has stalled			2
compounding this problem , only six @entity69 governments are meeting their commitments to spend 15 % of their national budgets on health			2
these trends must be reversed -- and quickly -- in order to accelerate progress			0
insufficient money is not the only thing holding back the global @entity21 response			2
although treatment programs have grown massively -- they now reach nearly 10 million people around the world -- too many people are still being left behind			2
in the coming years , the world must do a better job at adapting treatment and prevention programs to reach those most at - risk , including @entity131 populations , drug users , and sex workers			2
doing so will , in some cases , require a sea - change in how these populations are treated			0
on a political level , leaders can do more to ensure that the hiv / aids responses in their countries are more equitable and free of stigma , as the first lady of @entity77 , @entity142 , recently did in a statement rejecting homophobia			0
equally important , donors must make sure that their resources are appropriately targeting these at - risk groups and tailored to match the unique nature of local and national epidemics			0
each @entity12 forces the world into a moment of reflection and accountability			2
on this 25th anniversary , we have much progress to celebrate , but we can not allow complacency to set in before we 're even halfway home			1
as we close in on a global tipping point and look to defeat @entity21 within our lifetimes , we must pick up the pace			1
we have the tools to defeat the epidemic , but we need reinvigorated political will and new resources from the public and private sectors			0
the message this year should be : let 's work harder , together , to make the beginning of the end of @entity21 a reality			1
or , to borrow from @entity9 's 1988 ad : " just do it			0
" the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			0

25 years on from the first @entity12 , much progress has been made in fight against @entity21
@entity177 says 16 @entity69 countries have passed the " beginning of end of @entity21 " tipping point
" treatment now works better , and costs less , allowing people with @entity21 to live long , productive lives "
but @entity177 says we must not allow complacency to set in ; there is still much to be done
