a prosecuting attorney greeted the jury in the @entity3 trial monday with a quote full of expletives , while his adversary decided it was appropriate to tell jurors a knock - knock joke			1
and that was just the beginning of opening statements in @entity3 's long - anticipated murder trial			1
in a case that has ignited national debate about gun laws and race relations , @entity3 , a neighborhood watch captain , is accused of second - degree murder in the fatal shooting of 17 - year - old @entity19 in february 2012 in @entity20 , @entity21			1
prosecutor @entity23 's first words to the six - woman jury may have raised a few eyebrows			2
' f * * * * * g punks , these a * * * * * * s all get away , ' " @entity23 quoted @entity3			1
" these were the words in this grown man 's mouth as he followed this boy that he did n't know			2
those were his words , not mine			0
" @entity3 , @entity23 said , " got out of his car with a pistol and two flashlights to follow @entity37 , who was walking home from a @entity39 , armed " with a fruit drink and a bag of candy			1
eventually the two became entangled on the ground in a fight			0
a witness has said @entity19 was on top of @entity3 , @entity23 said			1
" the defendant claims that while @entity19 was on top of him , he said , ' you are going to die tonight , ' " said @entity23			1
" @entity23 told jurors that no witnesses saw what happened the night of the shooting from beginning to end			0
witnesses only saw " slices " of what happened , he said			0
" we are confident that at the end of this trial you will know in your head , in your heart , in your stomach that @entity3 did not shoot @entity19 because he had to , " @entity23 said			1
" he shot him for the worst of all reasons , because he wanted to			0
" fast facts : @entity19 shooting in the first day of testimony , jurors heard witnesses recount @entity19 's trip to the convenience store , @entity3 's call complaining about a suspicious person walking through his neighborhood before @entity19 's killing , and a call from the previous august , in which @entity3 reported an alleged burglary to police			1
proceedings ended for the day when defense attorney @entity86 objected to the earlier call , which prosecutors argued was necessary to explain @entity3 's remark about burglars who " get away			1
" the @entity19 family sat watching the proceedings behind state attorney @entity93			1
before witness testimony began , judge @entity94 denied a defense request that @entity19 's father , @entity97 , leave the courtroom			1
@entity97 is a potential witness , and potential witnesses can be forced to sit outside of the courtroom to keep their testimony from being tainted by other witnesses			2
but the next - of - kin of victims are allowed to remain in court even if they 're expected to testify			2
@entity86 also accused @entity97 of using an obscenity toward a friend of @entity3 's while holding the door for him during a hearing two weeks ago			2
the friend , @entity110 , testified that he had n't wanted to make an issue of it before			0
" i was n't planning on coming up here			0
i do n't want to be sitting here , " he said			0
but @entity114 denied the request , and @entity19 remained in court -- but @entity3 's parents were covered by the rule regarding potential witnesses and had to sit outside , as did @entity119 , the lawyer for @entity19 's parents			1
at one point , @entity19 's father began crying as @entity23 detailed how officers tried to save his son 's life			1
@entity3 has mostly stared straight ahead without any signs of emotion			1
following @entity23 's statement , defense attorney @entity128 came forward to woo the jury			2
as he began , he told a knock - knock joke			2
but it failed to win a laugh			0
who 's there ? @entity3			2
@entity3 who ? good , you 're on the jury , " he said			2
" no more bad jokes , i promise that , " he told jurors			0
" i was convinced it was the delivery			0
" @entity128 quickly got on with the business of making his case : that @entity3 was forced to act in self - defense to save his own life			1
" the evidence will show this is a sad case ; no monsters here			0
... @entity3 is not guilty of murder			1
he shot @entity19 after he was viciously attacked			2
" with the help of @entity153 visuals , @entity128 spent hours hammering home his argument			0
he broke down @entity3 's 911 call in which he first reported seeing @entity19 and told about following him			1
" @entity157 did @entity3 know at the time in less than 10 minutes from him first seeing @entity158 that he , @entity3 , would be suckered punched in the face , have his head pounded on concrete and wind up shooting and tragically killing @entity19 , " @entity128 told jurors			1
@entity128 also deconstructed a 911 call a neighbor made , in which it is possible to hear screams and a shot in the background that @entity128 said was the sound of the fatal bullet			0
as the dramatic recording audio filled the courtroom , @entity3 showed no emotion			1
@entity19 's mother left the courtroom			1
" at the moment this actually became physical was that @entity19 -- i will use my words -- that @entity19 decided to confront @entity3 , " @entity128 said			1
" that instead of going home			0
he had plenty of time			0
this is , what , 60 or 70 yards			0
he could 've gone back and forth four or five times			0
" @entity128 quoted a witness named @entity188 who described the fight			0
" he called it a ' ground and pound ' by @entity19 , who he said was on top of @entity3 , beating him			1
" " he saw enough that this was serious , " @entity128 said			0
@entity3 cried out for help , looked at @entity188 and said , " help me			2
" but the beating continued while @entity188 went inside his home to call 911 , @entity128 said			0
shortly afterward , according to @entity128 , @entity3 said @entity19 " was beating me up , and i shot him			1
" @entity128 also disputed the prosecution 's claim that @entity19 was unarmed			2
" @entity158 armed himself with the concrete sidewalk and used it to smash @entity3 's head , " said @entity128			2
" no different than if he picked up a brick or smashed his head against a wall			0
that is a deadly weapon			0
" @entity128 showed jurors photos taken of @entity3 after the fight			2
" what you can really see in these pictures that you will have in evidence are the lumps , " @entity128 said			0
" the big knots on each side of his head			0
consistent with having his head slammed into concrete			0
" all - female jury to try @entity3 among the first prosecution witnessed called was the 911 dispatcher who took @entity3 's call before the shooting			1
@entity228 testified that he was trained to give general commands instead of direct orders to people			0
when @entity3 said he was following @entity19 , @entity228 told him , " okay we do n't need you to do that			1
" @entity228 told the prosecutor he 's liable for any direct orders he gives someone			0
on cross-examination , defense attorney @entity86 pointed out that @entity228 asked @entity3 , " which way is he running ? " " if you tell somebody twice to let you know if the person that they 're concerned about is doing anything else -- do you think they 're going to keep their eye on them ? " asked @entity86			1
" i ca n't answer that , " said @entity228			0
" you did tell him twice to let you know if that guy did anything else , " said @entity86			0
" yes sir , " said @entity228			0
@entity228 went on to say he only wanted a location of the suspect for officers and that he never told @entity3 to follow or keep his eye on @entity19			1
shortly before court got under way , @entity19 's mother , @entity260 , spoke to reporters , asking people to " pray for me and my family because i do n't want any other mother to experience what i 'm going through now			2
" judge : no state expert testimony on 911 calls @entity19 was black , and @entity3 identifies himself as @entity271			1
in a @entity274 poll released monday morning , 62 % of respondents say the charges against @entity3 are probably or definitely true .			1
