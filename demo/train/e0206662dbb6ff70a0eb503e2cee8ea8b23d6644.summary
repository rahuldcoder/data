the 19 - year - old has told investigators the brothers were self - radicalized via the @entity24			1
investigators also are looking into whether the online @entity25 @entity26 , put out by @entity27 , was used for instruction on how to make the bombs , but another source cautioned that other outlets could have provided that information			2
the twin blasts just before the finish line of the april 15 race killed three people and wounded more than 260 and turned a chunk of downtown @entity38 into a crime scene , disrupting the normal routines of countless others			1
authorities slowly began allowing residents and business owners back into the area tuesday			1
there was no word on when the street where the bombings occurred will be fully open to the public			1
that , the city says , will depend on how quickly building owners can make repairs and other issues			1
business owner @entity55 was among those who returned tuesday			1
he said he and his son narrowly missed injury in the bombing			2
" i 've had a tough time , " he said			2
" it 's just one of those things			1
" @entity65 , a businesswoman in the area , said it was important to get up and running again , but not just for economic reasons			2
" for us and our business , it 's really about how do we get back to @entity38 , how do we band together , how do we help those that were seriously injured that are going to have lifelong struggles , " she said			1

new details on officer 's slaying @entity104 was killed thursday night , near the beginning of a wild 24 hours that culminated in @entity11 's capture in the backyard of a home in @entity123 , a @entity38 suburb			1
authorities suspect @entity11 and his 26 - year - old brother of killing the officer , though @entity11 has not been charged in @entity104 's death			1
according to a source with direct knowledge of the investigation , @entity104 did n't even have time to activate his emergency alert before being shot four or five times in the chest and head as he sat in his patrol car on the @entity105 campus			2

i told them i 'm @entity163 , " @entity159 quoted the man as saying			2
" i was very scared			2
i asked them if they were going to hurt me			2
they said they wo n't hurt me			0
i was thinking , ' i think they will kill me later			0
' " the man escaped when the brothers stopped to fill up the gas tank , running for his life as one of the brothers swore at him , @entity159 reported			0
