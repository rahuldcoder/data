-- para-gliders soar above the snowy peaks and broad pistes where hundreds of youngsters are taking their first lessons at @entity7 's biggest ski school			1
nestled within the @entity9 beneath the @entity10 , @entity8 has earned a reputation as one of the world 's greatest winter playgrounds			1
the resort will host the @entity16 for the fifth time in 2017 and is bidding to stage the @entity18 for a record third time in 2022			0
at the foot of the mountains the @entity20 is taking place , giving motorists a momentary glimpse of the action as the bob hurtles above the ice wall			2
amateur daredevils on the nearby @entity30 can almost match the bobsleigh speeds of up to 140 kilometers per hour			0
the private club was established by @entity34 visitors as a winter tourist destination towards the end of the @entity37			0
on the valley floor stands the frozen lake of @entity8 -- home to an unlikely event of similar vintage -- " @entity46 " -- horse racing on snow and ice			1
" @entity46 is an exceptional event , " said the event 's president , @entity47			1
" it 's a meeting dating back from 1907 , so it 's the 106th anniversary this year			1
it 's run on three sundays in february and usually we have about 30,000 people attending			0
" watching paint dry is a mere instance compared to watching ice form , but each year the organizers have to wait patiently for a solid layer of at least 30 centimeters before declaring the event safe			2
then an army of helpers is needed to prepare the temporary land mass. a race track is marked out , while piste - bashers compact snow on top of the ice , affording the horses a modicum of grip			1
@entity71 starting gates are rolled in along with grandstands and a row of tents containing jockey changing and weighing rooms and the all - important corporate lounges			0
the race card at each meeting features flat racing , winter - style trotting and the local speciality , skijoring -- an awkward combination of horse , human and skis which is a clear crowd favorite			1
horses for @entity46 are brought to @entity8 from all over the world , including @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and the @entity34			1
before they set hoof onto the snow they have to undergo a change of shoes , a feat made possible by farrier @entity101 , who replaces regular shoes with a set containing winter grips and a unique layer of silicone to prevent snow sticking to hooves			0
" this has been invented and patented here in @entity8			1
without this , a pack of snow would form underneath and the horse would slip			0
it keeps the snow away , " he said			0
instead of adhering to hooves , the trampled snow forms a perilous kickback cloud fired into the path of the jockeys , who also need protection			1
" it 's like snowballs being thrown at you by a half tonne man , so it can be quite sore at times , " said jockey @entity125			0
to counter this , he sports a mask used by motocross riders in muddy conditions			0
en masse it produces the effect of a cavalry of @entity139 riding into battle			0
another addition to the jockey wardrobe at @entity46 is an oversized pair of fleecy slippers which would look less out of place on a circus clown -- vital footwear to cover riding boots while hanging around on a frozen lake before the race			1
even at this high altitude , the horses are physically able to handle the strain			2
" the altitude for the heart and lungs is not a problem for the horses , " said vet @entity154			2
" it 's not dangerous to them			0
maybe skijoring is dangerous because the horses are not really under control , but otherwise there is no risk			1
" @entity167 is a six - time skijoring champion -- and winner of sixteen races			2
as leader of the @entity8 ski school he can often be found handing out prizes to young skiers			1
but when @entity46 comes to town , he 's aiming for a prize of his own - " @entity177 " -- for the skijoring competitor who scores the most points over the three weekends			1
skijoring requires expert skiing skills as the jockey is pulled behind a rider-less horse			1
" we have not got that much control " said @entity167			0
" around 20 % is the driver 's responsibility and 80 % is the horse			0
" one of the hazards is the first bend , where all horses are aiming for the inside track and the curve sends skiers wide			2
jockeys often find themselves in the terrifying position of skiing alongside the sprinting horse of the team behind him			2
@entity167 uses his elbows to nudge horses aside -- if a hoof steps on a ski it 's enough to end their chances of winning			1
in the first race @entity167 finishes well down the field			2
but with two more weekends to go , he still has a chance to regain the title he lost last year			0
his pedigree in this unusual event is unmatched and only the brave would bet against the former " @entity177 " regaining his crown .			0
