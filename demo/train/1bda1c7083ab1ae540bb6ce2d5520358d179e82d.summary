-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 won re-election tuesday , according to a @entity0 projection , positioning the conservative hero for a potential shot at the @entity8 presidential nomination in 2016			1
@entity1 held off a challenge from @entity11 businesswoman and @entity13 school board member @entity12 , keeping hold of the governor 's office in a state that typically votes for @entity11 presidential candidates			1
the race was largely -- once again -- a referendum on @entity1			0
the @entity8 governor became a conservative rock star in 2010 when he successfully pushed a " budget repair " bill that stripped most state workers of their collective bargaining rights and slashed education spending by more than $ 1 billion			0
the cuts -- and the restriction of unions ' power -- triggered weeks of protests in @entity2 's @entity34 , followed by a move to recall @entity1 through a june 2012 special election			2
@entity1 survived , offering @entity8 a massive confidence boost that their favored policies could be winners even in blue - tinted @entity40 states like @entity2			2
his victory in the recall election also earned @entity1 a spot on short lists of 2016 @entity8 presidential possibilities			1
he 's fallen back to earth since then , though , surviving accusations this summer of illegal campaign coordination but facing a much tougher than expected challenge from @entity50 , a @entity2 school board member who is also a former @entity51 executive and state secretary of commerce			1
she criticized @entity1 for signing into law bills that restrict access to abortions and legislation requiring state - issued photo identification to vote			0
she also pledged to restore state employees ' collective bargaining rights			0
@entity1 complained in the days before the election that national @entity8 groups had n't done enough to shore up the seat			2
he spent the campaign 's closing days traveling the state with @entity67 gov. @entity66 -- another possible 2016 presidential contender .			0
