the slick , black aircraft came roaring down the runway on its way into the sky			2
we had been allowed to watch the takeoff from an elevated viewing area about three - quarters of the way down the strip			2
there were the five of us attached to the @entity12 's @entity11 : writers @entity13 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and me			1
a handful of airmen assigned to a @entity22 air force base in the @entity23 were on hand as well			2
i was tracking the jet 's advance down the runway with my video camera			1
i pivoted as the plane swept by , and my view was suddenly blocked by one of the airmen			2
he stood pumping his fist up and down as the jet rose in front of us			1
i momentarily paused on him and lost the plane			2
it streaked by with a blast of sound and air displacement that went right through me			0
i turned my camera in time to catch the afterburners as the aircraft rose at a steep angle into the sky			0
i thought i had blown the shot with my pause on the airman 's pumping fist			1
but then i realized i actually had the real shot , the shot that told the fuller story			0
the shot that underlined what i had been seeing over and over as we traveled from base to base and visited troops stationed in support of military efforts			1
opinion : everyday should be @entity61 from the truck drivers to the pilots to the gate sentries to the colonels in command , the effort is one of pride and preparedness that left me with a new take on what it means to be heroic			1
these people , far from home and seemingly in the middle of nowhere , are the noble but unknown troops			1
they 've got true character			1
when i had first been approached about joining a @entity12 tour comprising authors , i jumped at the chance			1
after all , i am in the hero business			1
i write about fictional characters who face adverse circumstances and with relentless spirit and drive overcome the odds to succeed -- sometimes at great danger and cost to themselves			0
this is the coin of the realm when it comes to fiction			0
it 's character , character , character			1
slick plotting and exotic settings and forensic detail are all window dressing on the real deal			0
readers come into a story looking to connect with a character they identify with and want to ride with			1
they are looking for heroes			0
veterans day by the numbers so what better way to meet and research heroes than a @entity12 tour ? i heard that last year 's @entity111 went to @entity112 and the one before that visited troops in @entity115			1
the writers on those trips were furnished with @entity119 helmets and flak jackets			0
i assumed we would make a similar journey , that we were going where the troops dodged sniper bullets and ieds as a matter of course each day			1
but then i got the word			0
@entity11 would not be going to the front			1
we would spend a week visiting support bases scattered across the @entity132			0
though my family breathed easier at the news , i have to admit i was disappointed			1
i had signed up to meet heroes and now i was going to meet the troops who backed up the heroes			2
well , i got that wrong			0
on our weeklong @entity12 , i got the chance to visit with the heroes who load pallets of water on cargo planes , the heroes who patrol the desert for explosives dating back to the first @entity146 of 1991 , the heroes who fix and maintain the vehicles that cover the rugged ground in @entity112 and the hero pilots that fly in supplies instead of bombs			1
most of them came from reserve units from across the @entity22			0
it is work that is not without danger , but still it never gets the notice of the media focused squarely down range on the fight			0
no matter , these troops were n't looking for attention and they were n't looking to be called heroes			2
they simply were going about their jobs with pride and professionalism , knowing that down range it mattered			1
like the airman fist - pumping at the side of the runway , character and heroism are where you find them			2
sometimes , it 's maintaining the plane instead of flying it			2
sometimes , it 's moving water bottles instead of bullets			2
always faithful : @entity183 veterans tend to hero 's grave , cemetery i met an @entity188 specialist on a base in @entity190 who drives a forklift			1
he did n't wear a combat helmet			0
he wore a hard hat			0
his hard hat was a custom - made white cowboy hat he had ordered off the @entity197			0
his job was to move pallets of water on to cargo planes that lifted them to bases all across the region			0
in a place where summer temperatures routinely break 100 degrees before the sun is barely up , bottles of water can be as important as bullets			0
eight months into his posting , he said he had helped move more than 3 million bottles of water and counting			0
it was a figure of which he was proud			0
he knew he played an integral part in the fight			0
i did n't get to @entity112 , but the @entity12 and the man in the white hat taught me a lesson in what it is to be a hero			1
they showed me sacrifice , pride , professionalism and reminded me that being part of the team and doing the job right -- whether anyone is paying attention or not -- are the ingredients of character			1
join us at @entity235 / @entity234			0
