@entity0 -- the @entity2 on thursday extended a travel warning that had been issued for @entity4 because of the region 's high level of drug and gang violence			1
the @entity2 warning also notes that the authorized departure of family members of @entity13 government personnel from @entity13 consulates in the northern @entity4 border cities of @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 has been extended			1
the @entity2 issued similar warnings in march and april			2
the @entity4 government said in april that more than 22,700 people have been killed in drug - related violence since december 2006 , when president @entity26 declared war on narcotraffickers			1
" while most victims of violence are @entity4 citizens associated with criminal activity , the security situation poses serious risks for @entity13 citizens , as well , " the @entity2 warning says			1
much of the recent violence has occurred in northern @entity4 , where two drug cartels have been waging a bloody war since january			1
the area , which borders @entity39 , has seen ferocious fighting between the @entity42 and @entity43 cartels after a recent gangland slaying			0
hours - long gun battles are common , and @entity13 officials were forced earlier this year to temporarily close the consulate in @entity48 , a city in @entity50 state			0
@entity18 remains the most violent city in the nation , though			0
" since 2006 , three times as many people have been murdered in @entity18 , in the state of @entity57 , across from @entity58 , @entity39 , than in any other city in @entity4 , " the @entity2 travel warning says			1
" more than half of all @entity13 killed in @entity4 in @entity61 whose deaths were reported to the @entity13 @entity64 were killed in the border cities of @entity18 and @entity16			2
" the @entity2 targets six @entity4 states as particularly dangerous			2
" recent violent attacks and persistent security concerns have prompted the @entity13 embassy to urge @entity13 citizens to defer unnecessary travel to @entity72 and @entity50 , to parts of @entity57 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 and to advise @entity13 citizens residing or traveling in those areas to exercise extreme caution , " the warning says			2
the latest trouble in @entity50 and neighboring @entity82 state started january 18 , when @entity43 cartel members killed top @entity86 lieutenant @entity85			0
the @entity42 demanded that the @entity43 cartel turn over the killers , but the narco group refused			0
the @entity42 , composed mostly of former elite military troops , had been the armed enforcers for the @entity43 cartel since 2001			0
they have become more independent in recent years , and authorities say the all - out war between the two cartels indicates the split is permanent .			0
