@entity0 -- the lawyer for @entity3 , an @entity4 sentenced to death in @entity6 for espionage , has called for the ex-marine 's case to be judged on humanitarian , not political grounds			1
@entity11 , who has been engaged by the 28 - year - old 's family to try to secure his release and return home , said @entity3 was at risk of falling victim to the animosity between the @entity4 and @entity6			1
" what worries me most is that this case is entrapped in an intense political environment , " the @entity4 - based lawyer told @entity1			1
" we want to remove it from the political environment and establish a humanitarian corridor of communication and see if we can just talk about @entity3 as a human being			1
" @entity3 , who served in the @entity28 from 2001 to 2005 , was arrested in august 2011 while visiting his grandmother and other relatives in @entity6			1
his family has said he made the trip after obtaining permission from the @entity34 of the @entity35 in @entity36			0
on monday , @entity6 's semi-official @entity38 news agency reported that he had been convicted of espionage , " working for an enemy country , " being a member of the @entity41 and " efforts to accuse @entity6 of involvement in terrorism			1
" he has 20 days in which to appeal against his death sentence			0
his family , who live in @entity48 , claim that a " confession " aired on @entity6 state television last month was coerced			2
" we believe that there 's a fundamental misunderstanding , and that the accusations against him are false , " said @entity11			1
" that said , we 're prepared to open a line of communication with the government			0
we hope that they will accept it , because we believe that there is a workable way around this			0
" @entity67 , which represents @entity4 interests in @entity6 , has officially confirmed the verdict and sentence , @entity66 spokesman @entity65 said tuesday			1
the @entity4 has not had diplomatic relations with @entity6 since 1980 , but " strongly condemns " the sentence and passed that condemnation to @entity6 through the @entity67 , she said			1
" we maintain , as we have from the beginning , that these charges against him are a fabrication and we call on the @entity6 authorities to release him immediately , " @entity65 said			1
" we 've also called on them to allow him to have legal counsel			0
defendants in @entity6 are allowed to appeal within 20 days			2
" @entity65 said @entity36 has urged @entity6 authorities to allow @entity67 diplomats to visit @entity86 , a step they have so far denied			2
@entity11 is a former ambassador - at - large for war crimes issues under the @entity90 administration , and served as a war crimes prosecutor at the @entity92			1
in 2010 , he negotiated the release of @entity94 , an @entity6 - @entity4 businessman detained in @entity6 for more than two years on suspicion of supporting an anti-regime group			1
the high - profile lawyer said he hoped his previous experiences in @entity6 would help in the case			1
" i 've established some relationships based on my prior negotiations with the @entity94 case			0
i 'll try to revive those connections and see if they are willing to have a conversation			0
" it will be difficult , but it 's possible , and one of the ways to do it is to move the government out of this , and have it be a communication from the family to the [ @entity6 ] government			2
" @entity11 said he had been shocked at the speed of the proceedings against @entity3 , and was concerned at a lack of openness surrounding the trial			1
" this was literally a half - day trial ; he was in detention only for a few months , and the verdict came within weeks			0
we also are troubled by the fact there 's been no transparency , so it is really hard to see what happened			0
" @entity3 's family is " obviously shocked and troubled " at news he has been handed a death sentence , @entity11 told @entity1 , particularly since they have had no contact with him in recent months			1
" the family in the @entity4 has not spoken with him since his incarceration , his detention			2
from the videos we 've seen he looks to have lost weight , he appears to be under duress , and we 're concerned			0
" it is very difficult			0
i hear from them easily five or six times a day -- as you can imagine , the stress level is very high , " he said			0
" the news is not positive , but we try to reassure them that it is not over : we will engage with the government and we hope that they will show compassion			0
" our hope is that they will talk to us			0
our hope is that they will listen to the family and ... make a humanitarian decision			0
" the family 's message [ to @entity6 ] is : please show some compassion			2
