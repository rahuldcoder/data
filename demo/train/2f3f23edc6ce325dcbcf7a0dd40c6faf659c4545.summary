@entity0 , the prosecutor in the case surrounding the death of an @entity5 man at the hands of a white police officer , was endorsed by the @entity9 @entity8 this weekend as their pick to replace resigned @entity8 rep. @entity11 , according to local reports			1
party chairman @entity13 chose @entity0 after interviewing both him and assemblywoman @entity14 , who has also expressed interest in the seat			2
@entity13 said , however , the 31 - member executive committee showed their support " overwhelmingly in favor of @entity21 " in an informal poll			0
" at the end of the day , we felt , the committee felt , overwhelmingly that @entity26 would make a better candidate , " he said , according to the @entity22			0
though the @entity28 has yet to endorse a candidate and has informally expressed support for @entity14 , @entity9 makes up the vast majority of the district 's population , and the @entity35 's endorsement all but ensures @entity0 will win the @entity8 primary outright			1
the endorsement , which came as no surprise , was issued saturday , the day after @entity0 officially launched his bid for the seat			0
national republicans have privately expressed some concerns over @entity0 's involvement in the case concerning @entity45 , the @entity5 man who died at the hands of a white police officer following a banned chokehold			1
@entity0 was prosecutor in the case in which the grand jury decided not to indict the police officer , a decision that fueled further anger and protests from @entity56 nationwide frustrated by what they see as the unfair treatment of minorities by law enforcement			2
@entity11 won a decisive victory despite the cloud of controversy hanging over him after he was indicted last spring on 20 counts , including the tax fraud charge to which he ultimately pleaded guilty , which could result in jail time			0
the swing district has long been a top target for @entity71 , but their hopes for an early pickup this cycle grew when @entity11 announced his plans to resign from the seat after entering his guilty plea shortly before the start of the new @entity80 .			1

@entity26 , the prosecutor in the @entity45 case , is the @entity9 @entity8 's pick for @entity11 's seat
the seat is a top @entity71 target now that @entity11 has resigned
some national republicans are concerned @entity0 's involvement in the @entity45 case could be *problematic*
