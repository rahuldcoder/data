-- we 're just going to put it out there : behind closed doors , whites talk differently about blacks			1
at least that 's what two sociologists found after conducting a study of college students across the country			1
one of the researchers , @entity14 , said that 's why it comes as no surprise to him that a powerful politician such as senate majority leader @entity20 would talk about @entity22 's skin color and use the term " @entity24 " in what he considered a private conversation			1
speaking not of @entity20 but of his conclusions drawn from his research , @entity14 said , " most whites have sharply reduced the blatantly racist stuff they do in public , while they still do huge amounts in private			1
" " it 's just social correctness in the front stage			2
the scale of this is gigantic on the backstage , which is why the notion of a post-racial @entity41 is laughable , " said @entity14 , a professor at @entity36			1
" and i think most whites know it because they 've been to @entity45 dinner with @entity46 and have heard the n - word jokes			1
" @entity14 and @entity48 of the @entity49 compiled their research in a book called " @entity52 " published in 2007			1
they surveyed 626 white students at 28 colleges and universities across the country			0
they asked the students to keep diaries and record any racial events they came across during the course of a day			0
the students recorded 9,000 accounts , of which 7,500 were " blatantly racist " events ranging from private jokes and conversations to violent incidents , @entity14 said			1
about 100 accounts stood up against racism , he said			0
the majority of racial events were directed at @entity72 , but @entity73 and @entity74 also came under attack			0
@entity14 and @entity48 also surveyed @entity72 students , but that research is still being compiled			1
" in these 7,500 blatant accounts , most of them are accounts of what we call backstage racism -- that is they 're doing these performances and skits with friends and relatives , " @entity14 said			1
does it surprise him that someone with such political clout as @entity20 would use a term such as " @entity24 " ? " no , " @entity14 said , " not after looking at our student diaries			1
" he said @entity20 " felt safe making " the comment about @entity22 because he was in a private setting			2
" it 's a great teaching moment , " @entity14 said			1
" it shows the difference between the front stage and the backstage			0
he thought he was saying that in the backstage , and now it 's been brought out in the public for all to see and discuss			2
" the controversy is centered on remarks published in the book " @entity110 " by @entity111 and @entity112			0
the book cites @entity20 as saying privately in 2008 that @entity22 could succeed as a black candidate partly because of his " light - skinned " appearance and speaking patterns " with no @entity118 dialect , unless he wanted to have one			2
" @entity20 , @entity120 , apologized to the president after excerpts from the book were released , and @entity22 said he considered the issue closed			0
your take : ireporters sound off on the issue " this is a good man who 's always been on the right side of history , " @entity22 said monday in a sit - down interview with @entity0 political contributor @entity129			1
" for him to have used some inartful language in trying to praise me , and for people to try to make hay out of that , makes absolutely no sense			0
" @entity20 has received the support of the @entity142			0
on monday , he said numerous prominent @entity72 - @entity72 officials , including @entity145 chairman @entity144 and attorney general @entity146 , called to offer their support			2
sen. @entity148 , @entity149 , head of the @entity152 's @entity151 campaign arm , has called for @entity20 to give up his leadership post after the " embarrassing and racially insensitive " remarks			0
@entity156 chairman @entity155 also called for @entity20 to step down			0
@entity158 political science professor @entity157 said he does n't dispute that attitudes toward race may be viewed differently in private than in public			1
but he said he does n't feel that came into play with @entity20 's remarks			2
" many of us who work in areas of race and politics asked these same kinds of questions , about whether @entity22 is different for whites than other black politicians , " @entity157 said			2
" i do n't think sen. @entity20 was expressing sentiments he would not have expressed publicly			0
" @entity177 , an associate professor at @entity178 , said the country should n't let this moment pass			1
" the takeaway is that there is a teachable moment , but we ca n't allow politicians to do all the teaching , " @entity177 told @entity0 's " @entity186			1
" " if you watched president @entity22 's interview with @entity129 , the conversation tends to be let 's sweep this under the rug and throw the baby out with the bath water and move on			1
" but the truth is that they are trying to get health care passed , and that 's good , i respect that , but i want to have the conversation on race			0
" added @entity202 , a columnist and blogger with the @entity204 : " for me , it 's that we have to continue to talk about this			2
we ca n't only talk about it when we have these national flare - ups			1
this takes time and nuanced conversations			0
... " the country is changing			0
in a couple decades , we will have a country with a very different racial makeup			0
and we will have to have these conversations , and it 's to our peril if we do n't			2
" @entity14 , the sociologist , said he agrees			2
he said @entity219 and @entity22 should come forward to talk openly about the national climate on race			0
" we ca n't keep ducking this racism stuff , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity223 contributed to this report .			0

sociologists find whites talk differently about *african* - americans in private
" the scale of this is gigantic , " says @entity14 of @entity36
@entity14 : @entity235 's comments not surprising , hopes nation will learn from it
@entity178 associate prof says politicians should n't " sweep this under the rug "
