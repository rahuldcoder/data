-- one of the jurors in the trial of @entity3 said that race played no part in the case			1
the @entity8 jury on saturday convicted @entity3 , 47 , on three charges of attempted second - degree murder for shooting into an suv holding four black teenagers , after arguing with @entity13 , 17 , about the volume of their music			1
@entity3 is white ; @entity13 was black			1
the shots continued even as the suv was fleeing , and @entity3 was also convicted of one count of shooting into the vehicle			1
but a first - degree murder charge for @entity13 ' death resulted in a hung jury			1
" i never once thought about , oh , this was a black kid			2
this was a white guy , " juror no. 8 @entity25 told @entity0 on thursday			1
" we did n't even think about the race aspect of it , " she said			2
" race was never a factor ... when i was making my decision			2
" the case , for @entity35 , was just about justice			1
" when i walked into it , i just wanted to bring justice to whoever it was , " she said			2
@entity35 , 21 , said she believes @entity3 is guilty of murder , but not as charged			1
she thinks he was guilty of second - degree murder			1
" i think he is a good guy			2
i do n't think he hates everybody			2
i do n't think he walks around wanting to shoot everybody			2
i think that he made bad decisions , " she said			0
like juror no. 4 , who spoke to @entity51 ' " @entity50 , " @entity35 said that the jury was split over the issue of self - defense			1
in his testimony , @entity3 insisted that @entity13 threatened him and that he saw a gun			1
@entity57 never recovered a weapon			0
both jurors felt @entity3 crossed a line when he continued to fire at the suv as it fled the scene , that any threat @entity3 may have felt earlier had passed			1
" i was honestly convinced that he was in self - defense until he chased the car down and started shooting more , " @entity35 said			2
" even if initially you did n't have the opportunity to take yourself out of the situation to stop , running behind the car and shooting more , that 's where you completely push your limits			0
" @entity35 is one of two black women who served on the jury			2
the others were four white women , four white men , an @entity78 woman and a @entity80 man			0
' could not agree ' @entity35 said that @entity3 's fiancee , witness @entity13 , made the biggest impact on her			1
@entity13 testified that in the weeks after the shooting , @entity3 had never mentioned to her that he had seen a weapon of any kind			1
" she 's the sweetest lady , you can tell			0
she was trembling , like she could hardly move , but she yet she still got up there and told the truth , " @entity35 said			0
" she knew she had to tell the truth , but she knew how much it would hurt her life			0
but yet , she still told the truth			0
" @entity35 said that she and the other jurors " just could not agree " on the murder charge			1
when asked what she would tell @entity13 ' family members , the juror said that she would tell them that she tried			1
" i really did try			0
i tried to fight for his son			0
we , everyone that felt he was guilty , we fought and we fought and we fought , and i saw the look on his dad 's face when we came to nothing , " she said			0
" i know it hurts			0
it 's like thinking you 've got this wound healed and then somebody slices it open again because now they have to go through that whole process all over again			0
" misgivings about @entity8 law @entity35 spoke the same day @entity13 ' parents told @entity0 's " @entity120 " that @entity8 's laws about self - defense need to be changed			1
" we 're going to go to @entity123 , the state capital , and we 're going to try to get the ' stand your ground ' law rewritten , " said @entity121			0
" that 's our mission -- to make sure that we bring to light and expose all the laws in our nation that are not effective in keeping our citizens safe , " said the teen 's mother , @entity127			0
@entity8 law says the use of deadly force is justifiable if someone reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm			0
its law also says people have no " duty " to retreat from a would - be attacker , as do laws in 21 other states , according to the @entity146			2
@entity3 's attorneys did not use the " stand your ground " defense , but prosecutor @entity152 told @entity0 on wednesday that the laws need to revert to what they were before " stand your ground " was enacted , in 2005			1
" i believe prosecutors and the sheriffs association are in favor of the former laws that we had on use of deadly force , and we do believe that , before someone should engage in a physical altercation , or especially an altercation where deadly force is used , we do believe there should be a duty to retreat , " she said			0
@entity121 said the jurors who deliberated for four days whether his son 's killer committed premeditated murder in the first degree faced another hurdle in not being able to use their " common sense , " as prosecutor @entity176 had urged them to do in his closing - argument rebuttal			1
" common sense and the law is not the same thing , unfortunately , " @entity13 said			1
" to the layman , premeditation is if you go home to get a gun or you go in your car separately to get a gun or you plan something -- to us , that 's premeditation			0
but to the law , it could be three seconds			0
" despite his assertion that the current law was responsible for the hung jury , @entity13 said he supported @entity196 's decision to retry @entity3 on the murder charge			1
" the world needs to know that @entity13 did nothing wrong and that this man is guilty of killing our son , of murdering our son , " he said			2
' @entity204 ' the incident occurred november 23 , 2012 , when @entity3 pulled into a gas station in @entity207 , parking next to a red @entity208 with four teenagers inside			2
the teens had gone there for gum and cigarettes ; @entity3 , had just left his son 's wedding with his fiancee , who 'd gone inside the convenience store for wine and chips			2
@entity3 did n't like the loud music -- " rap crap , " he called it -- coming from the teens ' suv			1
so he asked them to turn it down			0
what followed next is a matter of debate			0
@entity3 testified that @entity13 threatened him , and he decided to take matters into his own hands upon seeing what he thought was the barrel of a gun sticking out of the @entity208			1
but prosecutors say @entity3 lost control , firing 10 bullets , nine of which struck the suv , over music he did n't like			1
" my intent was to stop the attack , not necessarily end a life , " he testified			0
" it just worked out that way			0
" police found a basketball , basketball shoes , clothing , a camera tripod and cups inside the @entity208 , but no gun			0
@entity0 's @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 and @entity255 contributed to this report .			0
