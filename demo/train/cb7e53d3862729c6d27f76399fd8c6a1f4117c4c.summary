-- a trip to the @entity2 in @entity3 should be all about superhuman feats of skill or endurance on skis , skates or bobsleighs			1
but hearing the talk of @entity13 security plans in the run - up to the @entity15 in @entity16 next month , visitors may think they are entering a war zone			1
contingency plans for evacuating @entity13 in case of an attack are well in hand , it would seem			2
the @entity13 is moving to two warships into the @entity24			2
if ordered , helicopters could be launched from there to @entity3 , a @entity13 official told @entity0 recently			1
and if more capacity is needed , c - 17 transport aircraft will be on standby in @entity30 and could be on the scene in about two hours			0
that 's in addition to @entity13 precautions on @entity16 soil , where @entity37 agents are now arriving in @entity3 to work with their @entity16 counterparts , according to rep. @entity39 , chairman of the @entity13 @entity40			1
the @entity13 has also discussed at the highest levels the sharing of its high - tech bomb detection technology -- developed to protect service members from deadly homemade bombs in @entity47 and @entity48 -- with @entity16			1
concern over explosives is heightened because the radical islamists who have threatened to attack the @entity52 have a track record with hidden bombs			0
one was detonated under a stadium grandstand in @entity57 in 2004			0
look who 's watching over you at @entity3 and with the largest delegation of any nation to the @entity2 and @entity63 , as well as -- according to @entity39 -- 10,000 to 15,000 @entity13 as spectators , the @entity13 appears to be taking nothing for granted when it comes to security			1
@entity13 athletes , coaches and staff are being warned not to wear their red , white and blue @entity72 uniforms outside the " ring of steel , " the @entity16 security cordon surrounding @entity3			1
they also will be under the watchful eye of @entity13 security officials who will attend events with them , according to @entity80 officials			1
travel warning issued the @entity80 went so far last week as to issue an updated travel alert for the region , warning game - goers that bombings and abductions continue in @entity16 , particularly in the @entity83			1
it cited media reports about the hunt in @entity3 by @entity16 authorities for " black widows , " wives of dead insurgents who act as suicide bombers , even as it said the @entity13 government has not corroborated the reports			1
the reports were just one example of what one senior @entity80 official has described as an " uptick in threat reporting " in the lead - up to the @entity2			1
" our expectation is that we will see more in the coming weeks , " the official , speaking on background , told reporters during a briefing on @entity72 security measures			0
but is the @entity13 contingency planning in line with the potential threat ? security expert @entity113 , editor of @entity115 's intelligence review in @entity116 , thinks not			2
" it 's normal for countries to outline contingency plans for the removal of their nationals from any country in which there 's a risk to them , " he said			0
" at the same time , this is usually only undertaken in very serious situations such as cases of civil war or other kinds of conflict			0
" in the event of a terrorist attack on someone in @entity3 , even if it was around the city or venues , i do n't think the idea of there being a @entity13 military evacuation of their citizens from there would be a realistic prospect			1
" this , says @entity113 , is because it would cause huge logistical difficulties , would likely be overkill in terms of the situation and " probably the @entity16 would n't be very happy			2
" ' we 've had conversations ' it is unclear whether a military evacuation would entail @entity13 forces entering @entity16 territory , but secretary of defense @entity156 has publicly hinted that there is a plan of some sort			1
" we 've had conversations with the @entity16 government on protection of our citizens , " @entity161 said recently			2
he also has said the @entity13 has offered assistance to @entity16 , but there has been no request from the @entity16 government for help			1
@entity39 , speaking on @entity0 's @entity171 , also said the notion that @entity173 needs foreign help to deal with its own homegrown terrorist threat would likely rile many @entity16			2
" there 's a sense of nationalistic pride in @entity16 , just as we would have in the @entity13 , " said @entity39			1
" and so , while they 've been very productive , cooperating with us on some issues , when it comes to the military , it gets a little sensitive			0
" but former @entity37 assistant director @entity184 , a @entity0 law enforcement analyst , believes the @entity13 precautions make sense			1
" you 'd hope that the @entity13 would n't be sitting around waiting for a telegram from @entity16 going ' hey , come and get your people			1
' so to me , that 's a commonsense approach , and the military should have a very robust plan to come in and do that , " he said			0
" if an attack occurs , you 're going to have chaos			0
you 're going to have a large problem to get ships and get helicopters , so merely getting your forces in to get your people out will be quite an event just by itself			0
" @entity16 ambassador says he 's certain @entity2 will be safe @entity203 taking ' extra measures ' other nations are well - aware of the security risk attached to any such major event -- but are more coy about their precautions			1
@entity209 , spokesman for the @entity210 , declined to go into detail about the security measures planned for @entity213 in @entity3			2
" we will take some extra measures for our delegates , " he told @entity0			2
but , he stressed , " that is not new -- we have done that for a number of games			0
that 's been part of our planning from the beginning			0
" @entity209 said the primary responsibility for security always falls to the host country and the organizing committee			0
it 's something of which @entity203 is very conscious , having hosted the @entity15 in 2012			2
as it turned out , the @entity230 went off without incident , but the security measures taken included parking missile batteries on apartment block roofs and a huge warship on the @entity236			0
the precautions in @entity3 are even more extensive , those who 've been there say			1
" this security operation is the most impressive and well - fortified that we 've ever seen in @entity72 history , " @entity39 said			0
even so , a @entity244 poll conducted in the @entity13 last week found that half those surveyed believe a terrorist attack at the @entity2 is very or somewhat likely			2
allaying fears but @entity13 authorities have sought to allay concerns			2
" what i can tell you is there has been an uptick in some of the reporting , but that is not unusual			0
it 's of concern , but not unusual for an event like this , " said @entity260 spokesman @entity259			0
" the @entity80 has handled and is handling the issue of travel advisories for @entity13 citizens , and we are offering the @entity16 any assistance that they might require or request in a situation like this			1
" it 's not clear exactly how many people will travel to @entity3 for the @entity15			1
@entity273 , chief executive of the @entity274 , said in a statement : " the safety and security of @entity278 is our top priority			0
" as is always the case , we are working with the @entity13 @entity80 , the local organizers and the relevant law enforcement agencies in an effort to ensure that our delegation and other @entity13 traveling to @entity3 are safe			1
" former champion @entity72 swimmer @entity285 said that the security issues are likely the last thing on the athletes ' minds right now			0
" as an athlete , we do n't notice anything , " he said			0
" you know , we 're there to represent our country and we are there to compete at the highest level			0
" being in the @entity297 with athletes from all over the world is incredible , he said , adding " there 's nothing like it			0
" @entity0 's @entity303 and @entity304 contributed to this report .			0
