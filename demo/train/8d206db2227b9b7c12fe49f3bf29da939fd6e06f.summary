-- even for able - bodied golfers , the @entity1 is a stern test of stamina			1
and this week 's venue , the @entity7 's hilly , tree - lined @entity9 course , is as demanding as it gets			1
@entity11 can not walk for 18 holes , but nonetheless he will tee off in @entity13 on thursday 14 years after he made his only other appearance at a major tournament , also at @entity7			1
back then he was at the center of controversy as he sought special dispensation to use a golf cart due to a birth defect which affects the circulation in his right leg , causing him severe discomfort			1
" it 's not great at times			2
i 'm able to do it , but i 'm in pain when i play so i 'm grateful i have a ride to my shots , " the 40 - year - old told @entity0			1
" i deal with pain but it 's bearable			2
it helps me sometimes to concentrate -- i realize there 's only one thing i can do and i try to block out my leg			1
" @entity1 latest scores @entity11 eventually won the right to use a cart , appealing to the @entity39 after the @entity40 fought hard to prevent what it considered a dangerous precedent contravening its rules			1
legendary names such as @entity45 and @entity46 were called in to testify against him			2
in the end , it proved to be a storm in a teacup			2
@entity11 tied for 23rd at the 1998 @entity1 but the @entity52 - born golfer played only one full year on the @entity40 -- in 2000 -- and finally quit the professional circuit after another season struggling on the second - tier @entity55 in 2006			1
since then he has been coaching the @entity57 's golf team , but he decided to have a go at last week 's @entity1 regional qualifying event despite limited preparation			1
" it just came together			2
i have n't been playing much golf			0
i 've been around it with my team , i coach them , and i practice a little bit but i do n't play a lot of golf , " he said			1
" leading up to that qualifier i was at the national championship with my guys , so i hit about 20 minutes worth of golf balls that week			1
it was kind of a random occurrence me getting in , but i 'm glad i went through the qualifier and grateful i got hot at the right time and i get an experience like this as a reward			0
" while his early years trying to establish a place on the circuit were difficult , @entity11 is now hoping to cherish his return to the spotlight			1
" my life changed on monday night when i qualified -- phone calls and demands , and a lot of well wishers			0
which meant a lot , it 's been a really neat experience for me , " he said			0
" i have n't had much time for myself so i 'm anxious to get inside the ropes and just go play			1
realistically i do n't know what to expect			0
it 's so hard to quantify because i do n't play a lot of golf and i certainly have n't competed in so long			2
" so what does that mean when you go to a stage like this , where there 's millions of people watching on tv and the golf course is so hard ? i do n't know			0
i do n't even know what my golf should be , but i am going to give it great effort , enjoy every bit of it , add ' em up and see what that means			0
" @entity11 has already had a taste of what 's to come after tuesday 's practice round with his former @entity122 college teammate , @entity121			1
they played together at the 1998 @entity1 , when @entity124 -- who had already won the masters by that stage -- tied for 18th			1
" man , it 's great to see him			0
and just so happy in life			0
it 's good to see him in a really good place " said @entity124 , who is seeking to win his 15th major title but his first since the @entity130 at @entity131			2
" unless you really know him , i do n't think people have an appreciation of how much pain he 's in			0
just the everyday pain he lives with			0
he does n't show it , does n't talk about it , does n't complain , he just lives with it			0
" and you just look at him and he 's always so happy			0
it 's very easy to go the other way and be very bitter , because of how uncomfortable he is on a daily basis			0
but i think that 's what makes him special			0
that 's what makes him so different than everyone else -- he has such a strong will and such a strong spirit			0

@entity11 will play at his first major tournament since the 1998 @entity1
golfer will again use a cart to get around the @entity7 course
the 40 - year - old @entity166 suffers from a circulatory *problem* in his right leg
he played with college teammate @entity121 in practice this week
