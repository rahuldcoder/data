-- former top @entity2 military officers sunday called for @entity2 's former strongman to be allowed back without facing arrest and condemned what they called the " bashing " of the country 's armed forces			2
more than 100 former officers , most of them generals and admirals , signed their names to a letter calling for @entity14 to be allowed to return to @entity2 " and contest elections according to democratic norms			1
" the retired brass included the retired gen. @entity18 , once the head of @entity2 's @entity20 during part of @entity14 's rule , and adm. @entity23 , who served as head of the navy under @entity14			2
" we feel that gen. ( r ) @entity14 should be provided with a level playing field in the political arena and also provided protocol and security as befits any ex-president of the @entity35 of @entity2 , " wrote the officers , who have formed a group they called " @entity28			2
" @entity14 , who seized power in a 1999 coup , has been living in @entity38 and @entity39 since resigning in 2008			1
he had announced plans to return from exile in late january and run in upcoming elections -- but his party said he was reassessing those plans when @entity2 's elected government warned that if he returned , he faced arrest in connection with the 2007 assassination of former prime minister @entity49			1
a @entity51 report in 2010 accused @entity14 's government of failing to protect @entity49 , who had returned to @entity2 from her own exile to run for office			1
@entity14 has denied the allegations , arguing that @entity49 had police protection and took unnecessary risks , but a @entity2 court issued a warrant for his arrest			1
@entity49 's widower , @entity61 , is now @entity2 's president			0
if @entity14 were to return , he would be walking into the middle of a public squabble between @entity2 's civilian and uniformed leadership that was sparked by a memo that allegedly asked for @entity68 help to rein in the military			1
in sunday 's letter , the ex-generals said they opposed the " bashing " of @entity2 's army and its powerful @entity74			0
" we feel that erosion of these institutions can only lead to weakening of @entity2 's position as a sovereign and proud nation , " they wrote			0
" this forum feels that while all state institutions must be allowed to function within the purview of their respective roles , the demands of national dignity and state security dictate that all organs of the state as well as the media persistently raise and maintain the prestige and morale of the nation and its armed forces , both at home and abroad			0
" @entity61 faces his own legal problems			0
his prime minister , @entity96 , appeared before @entity2 's supreme court thursday in a battle over corruption cases facing the president and other officials , telling reporters the president has " full immunity " from prosecution under an amnesty granted by @entity14 before @entity61 and @entity49 returned in 2007			2
in 2009 , the justices ruled that amnesty was unconstitutional and called on the government to reopen the cases			0
the government has not done so , and the court has cited @entity96 for contempt .			0
