saying he had no discretion under state law , a judge sentenced a @entity4 , @entity5 , woman to 20 years in prison friday for firing a warning shot in an effort to scare off her abusive husband			1
@entity11 unsuccessfully tried to use @entity5 's controversial " stand your ground " law to derail the prosecution , but a jury in march convicted her of aggravated assault after just 12 minutes of deliberation			1
the case , which was prosecuted by the same state attorney who is handling the @entity22 case , has gained the attention of civil rights leaders who say the @entity27 - @entity26 woman was persecuted because of her race			1
after the sentencing , rep. @entity29 confronted state attorney @entity31 in the hallway , accusing her of being overzealous , according to video from @entity35 affiliate @entity34			1
" there is no justification for 20 years , " @entity29 told @entity36 during an exchange frequently interrupted by onlookers			2
" all the community was asking for was mercy and justice , " she said			0
@entity36 said she had offered @entity44 a plea bargain that would have resulted in a three - year prison sentence , but @entity44 chose to take the case to a jury trial , where a conviction would carry a mandatory sentence under a @entity5 law known as " 10 - 20 - life			1
" the law mandates increased penalties for some felonies , including aggravated assault , in which a gun is carried or used			0
@entity36 said the case deserved to be prosecuted because @entity44 fired in the direction of a room where two children were standing			2
@entity44 said she was attempting to flee her husband , @entity62 , on august 1 , 2010 , when she picked up a handgun and fired a shot into a wall			1
she said her husband had read cell phone text messages that she had written to her ex-husband , got angry and tried to strangle her			2
she said she escaped and ran to the garage , intending to drive away			0
but , she said , she forgot her keys , so she picked up her gun and went back into the house			2
she said her husband threatened to kill her , so she fired one shot			1
" i believe when he threatened to kill me , that 's what he was absolutely going to do , " she said			0
" that 's what he intended to do			0
had i not discharged my weapon at that point , i would not be here			0
" @entity44 's attorneys tried to use the state law that allows people to use potentially deadly force anywhere they feel reasonably threatened with serious harm or death			0
but a previous judge in the case rejected the request , saying @entity44 's decision to go back into the house was not consistent with someone in fear for her safety , according to the @entity98 newspaper			2
a jury convicted @entity44 in march and judge @entity100 denied her request for a new trial in april			1
@entity100 handed down the sentence friday after an emotional sentencing hearing during which @entity44 's parents , 11 - year - old daughter and pastor spoke on her behalf			1
several people had to be escorted from the courtroom after breaking out singing and chanting about a perceived lack of justice in the case , but @entity100 made a point to say that he had no choice under state law			1
" under the state 's 10 - 20 - life law , a conviction for aggravated assault where a firearm has been discharged carries a minimum and maximum sentence of 20 years without regarding to any extenuating or mitigating circumstances that may be present , such as those in this case , " @entity100 said			1
@entity29 , the @entity4 congresswoman , told reporters after the sentencing that the case was a product of " institutional racism			2
" " she was overcharged by the prosecutor			0
period , " @entity29 said			0
" she never should have been charged			0
" @entity29 has been more complimentary about @entity36 's work in the @entity22 case , where her office filed second degree murder charges against neighborhood watch volunteer @entity135 in the february 26 death of the unarmed @entity27 - @entity26 teen - ager			0
that case provoked nationwide protests demanding @entity135 's arrest after an initial police investigation released him under the " stand your ground " law .			0
