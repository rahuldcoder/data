@entity0 -- president @entity4 's recess appointments to a federal agency -- made without @entity7 confirmation -- will be reviewed by the @entity8 , the court announced monday			1
it will mark a major constitutional test of executive power			0
at issue is whether three people named to the @entity14 lack authority because the presidential appointments were made while the @entity7 was technically in a " pro forma " session during the 2011 - 12 winter holiday break			1
the case sets up a high - stakes @entity8 fight between the other two branches of government			0
oral arguments will be held in public session later this year or early next			0
@entity27 and @entity28 lawmakers in the past have used the " virtual @entity33 " tactic to block unilateral appointments by the president when the @entity7 is away			1
a federal appeals court in january determined the @entity14 " could not lawfully act , as it did not have a quorum			1
" republicans had claimed the appointments to the board created a panel that was overly pro-union , and an eventual high court ruling could invalidate hundreds of findings issued over the past two years			0
what the justices decide could also put in jeopardy the recess appointment of @entity46 , who heads the @entity47 , a move also being challenged in a separate lawsuit			0
" allowing the president to define the scope of his own appointments power would eviscerate the @entity57 's separation of powers , " said the judges from the @entity51 in their january 25 ruling			1
" an interpretation of ' the recess ' that permits the president to decide when the @entity7 is in recess would demolish the checks and balances inherent in the advice - and - consent requirement , giving the president free rein to appoint his desired nominees at any time he pleases , whether that time be a weekend , lunch , or even when the @entity7 is in session and he is merely displeased with its inaction			1
this can not be the law			0
" justices to hear abortion - related case for review the @entity77 has said it believes the pending case will not affect @entity46 's appointment , but did express displeasure with the appeals court 's january action			0
" the decision is novel and unprecedented			0
it contradicts 150 years of practice by @entity28 and @entity27 administrations , " said @entity85 , @entity77 press secretary			0
" so we respectfully , but strongly disagree with the rulings			0
there have been -- according to the @entity92 -- something like 280 - plus intra-session recess appointments by @entity28 and @entity27 administrations dating back to 1867			0
that 's a long time and quite a significant precedent			0
" there was no immediate reaction from the @entity77 or congressional leaders monday to the @entity8 's decision to intervene and offer the final legal word			0
eighteen months ago , @entity4 had defended his moves after @entity104 earlier blocked giving @entity46 a floor vote			1
" when @entity33 refuses to act and as a result hurts our economy and puts people at risk , i have an obligation as president to do what i can without them , " the president said in january 2012			1
" i will not stand by while a minority in the @entity7 puts party ideology ahead of the people they were elected to serve			2
" @entity7 @entity104 had applauded the earlier court decision			2
" the @entity51 today reaffirmed that the @entity57 is not an inconvenience but the law of the land , agreeing with the owners of a family - owned business who brought the case to the court , " senate minority leader @entity120 said in a written statement			2
some @entity27 lawmakers also accused the president of flip - flopping on the issue			2
when he was a senator , @entity4 criticized then - president @entity135 's recess appointment of @entity136 as ambassador to the @entity138			1
high court poised for a week of high - stakes rulings @entity46 was named the same day as the three @entity14 appointments , which gave the board a full panel for the first time in a year			1
two of the members were @entity28 , the other a @entity27			0
the lawsuit was brought by @entity149 , a family - owned @entity150 , @entity0 , bottling company , which complained the @entity14 unfairly ruled in favor of @entity154 during contract negotiations			1
company executives said the board lacked a binding quorum because the recess appointments made by @entity4 were not legal			1
" small - business owners throughout the country have suffered under the unabashedly pro-union decisions handed down by the @entity14 , " said @entity160 , executive director of the @entity161 , which filed an amicus brief in the case			2
" they deserve to be protected from unconstitutional acts that exacerbate the @entity14 's devolution from a neutral arbiter between labor and employers to a pro-union government agency			1
" the issue has sharpened tensions between the @entity77 and @entity33			2
the nation 's founders placed the power to make recess appointments in the @entity57 to ensure government could operate , back when @entity33 did not meet year - round			1
over the decades , presidents of both parties have used them for political and practical purposes			0
since may 2011 , republicans have been relying on a little - known procedure to keep the chamber in session , even when it was not really conducting any business -- in order to stop the president from making those recess appointments			2
the legal basis comes from a 1993 @entity195 brief saying the president should act only if the @entity7 is in official recess more than three days			1
so , party leaders had arranged for a single @entity27 lawmaker to show up every three days and gavel the @entity7 to order , wait around for a while , gavel it to a close , then leave			2
legal experts have disagreed on both the tactical and timing procedures by the @entity7 , and whether the president has unilateral authority to override those legislative tactics			1
the case to be decided by the high court is @entity149 v. @entity14 ( 12 - 1115 ) .			0

president @entity4 had appointed @entity14 members during a @entity7 holiday break
lawmakers had used a " virtual @entity33 " tactic to prevent such appointments
