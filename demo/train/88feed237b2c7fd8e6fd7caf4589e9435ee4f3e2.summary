@entity0 , @entity1 -- the lawyer of a @entity1 father accused of carrying out a bizarre hoax involving his son and a huge balloon said monday that official charges in the case could be filed next week			1
authorities announced that @entity11 and his wife , @entity11 , face several felony charges , but @entity13 said the sheriff was overreaching with the charges			1
" it 's piling on and it 's using charges that really are n't designed to fit this sort of allegation , " @entity13 said on " @entity16			0
" " the attempt to influence a public official fraudulently , that 's bribing a public official			0
that 's not what happened here			0
" the @entity27 face charges of conspiracy , contributing to the delinquency of a minor and attempting to influence a public servant , @entity26 sheriff @entity11 said sunday			1
the family also probably will be charged with filing a false police report , which is a misdemeanor , @entity11 said			1
@entity13 has said that the couple is " not running from the law " and deserves the presumption of innocence			1
" the sheriff having a press conference saying that they 're guilty does not make them so , " @entity13 told @entity2 's " @entity43			0
" authorities say the event -- in which the tearful couple said their 6 - year - old might have been trapped in the drifting balloon -- was staged			2
@entity11 and @entity11 had met in a @entity50 acting school and pursued fame for their family in the world of reality tv , @entity11 said			1
@entity13 , asked monday by @entity2 about his client 's state of mind , said it was " what you would expect someone 's state of mind to be after law enforcement searched your house , seized your property , held a press conference announcing you 're about to be charged with felony criminal charges			0
your state of mind would be rather upset and you would feel somewhat under siege , which is exactly how the family feels at this point			0
" during the incident thursday , as millions worldwide watched live tv coverage of the contraption floating above northern @entity1 , authorities did not pick up on any deceptive behavior , @entity11 said			1
but that night , during an interview on @entity2 's " @entity16 , " the boy , @entity11 , gave authorities an " aha ! moment , " @entity11 said			1
" you guys said we did this for the show , " @entity11 said in the interview , when his father asked him why he had not come out from hiding when his parents were looking for him			2
@entity11 and @entity11 said their son was simply confused			2
@entity13 said on " @entity16 " on monday that he thinks @entity11 was referring to his demonstration to reporters of how he hid from view			0
but authorities enacted a game plan to get the truth , @entity11 said			1
the plan included misleading the media on friday when @entity11 said authorities still believed the incident was not a hoax			1
they wanted to keep the couple 's trust , the sheriff said			0
investigators pursued separate interviews and polygraph tests with the @entity11 parents saturday , then searched the couple 's home early sunday for computer records , phone records , video recordings and other potential evidence , @entity11 said			0
" the sheriff put both of them on a box , and they have not shared with us whether or not they passed or failed , " @entity13 told " @entity43 " on monday			0
polygraphs are not admissible in court , @entity13 added			0
@entity11 said that , under @entity1 law , authorities can not announce whether polygraph tests were taken -- only that authorities pursued them			1
he added that authorities plan to seek restitution for the expenses incurred in the wild goose chase for @entity11			1
because authorities are n't required to share evidence until charges are filed , @entity13 said he could not lay out the @entity27 ' defense			1
" until that point ... i 'm shooting in the dark , " he said , adding , " if they have probable cause to make an arrest , then make an arrest and give me the evidence			0
" @entity140 : " outraged " over balloon hoax @entity11 , speaking at a news conference sunday , said authorities are concerned about the safety of all three @entity11 children , ages 6 , 8 , and 10			1
authorities spoke with @entity11 about domestic violence and the children 's safety , the sheriff said			1
" but we did n't have enough that would allow us or child protection services to physically take the kids from that environment			0
" a 9 - 1 - 1 call from the home earlier this year led authorities to a " suspicious circumstance " that the sheriff said might have involved " domestic violence , perhaps against the wife			0
" @entity13 told @entity2 affiliate @entity160 on sunday that he has " no reason to believe they 're anything but loving parents			0
" ireport.com : " balloon boy saga is symptom , not disease " speaking to @entity2 on monday , @entity13 said the @entity11 children were in his office sunday , and that by his observations as a father of three , " they seem to be perfectly , normal , happy , well - adjusted kids that are being insulated from this process as much as possible			1
" during a round of live tv interviews friday morning , @entity11 was sick , which many speculate was because he was upset about the incident			1
one of the questions that remains unanswered is where @entity11 was as the balloon drifted			1
on friday , @entity11 said it had been determined that the boy was hiding in an attic in the garage			2
now , authorities are unsure			0
@entity11 said the boy might not have even been in the home			2
the @entity27 have previously appeared on the @entity193 program " @entity194			0
" @entity11 also chases storms , brings his family along and takes videos			2
@entity198 , which produces the show " @entity200 " -- told @entity2 that the @entity27 had " approached us months ago " about a possible show , " and we passed			0
" @entity11 has been described as a meteorologist , but his education ended at the high school level , @entity11 said			0
the sheriff said investigators want to interview researcher @entity207 , who worked with @entity11 for about two months this past spring			2
@entity207 , 25 , was paid by the gossip site @entity209 to write about his experience with @entity11 for a story published on saturday			2
in an interview arranged with the help of @entity209 , @entity207 told @entity2 that at one point they talked about the @entity215 of the late 1940s , when @entity11 said it would be easy to cook up " a media stunt that would be equally profound as @entity215 , and we could do so with nothing more than a weather balloon and some controversy			2
