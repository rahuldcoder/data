-- almost 20 years ago , @entity1 walked away from " @entity2 " -- the wildly popular comic strip he created and illustrated from 1985 until 1995			1
fans of the mischievous 6 - year - old boy and his sardonic stuffed tiger have been left wanting more ever since			0
for the time being , they can at least take comfort in some cameo work released this week			2
@entity10 writes " @entity11 , " which chronicles the lives of its main characters -- @entity14 , and the dreaded @entity15			1
he 's also a big @entity1 fan			1
last spring he attempted to reach the notoriously reclusive comics legend via e-mail , to no avail			0
undeterred , @entity10 included a " @entity2 " reference in his next strip			0
in it , @entity10 approaches a woman at a bar and uses his profession to impress a female patron			0
when the woman asks which strip he draws , @entity10 says " ever heard of ' @entity2 ? ' " the two end up in bed , a thought bubble above @entity10 ' head says : " that was wrong			0
" shortly after that , much to @entity10 ' surprise , @entity1 replied			1
" just getting an email from @entity1 is one of the most mind - blowing , surreal experiences i have ever had			1
@entity1 really exists ? and he sends email ? and he 's communicating with me ? " @entity10 wrote on his blog			1
not only was @entity10 in communication with him -- @entity1 wanted to collaborate			1
the two decided that @entity1 would contribute panels to three " pearls " cartoons			1
the series of strips ran nationally this week with the premise that a small girl named ' @entity52 ' ( or ' @entity53 ' ) would stand in for @entity54			1
according to @entity10 ' blog , ' @entity53 ' is " a precocious second grader who thought my art was crap " and is really a cheeky inside joke			0
( @entity60 : ' @entity53 ' is almost ' @entity61 ' spelled backward )			0
in the first of the three strips , ' @entity53 ' draws two crocodiles eating @entity54			2
the second strip is more reminiscent of @entity1 's " @entity2 " days and features a " martian robot attack " that could be seen as nod to @entity69 's alter ego @entity70			2
the third ends with @entity10 asking @entity53 if she 'll draw his comic forever			0
the art form 's dying , " she responds			0
according to @entity10 , having the legendary @entity1 draw his strip is like working with " the @entity78 of cartooning " -- rare , and the highlight of his career			2
millions of fans feel exactly the same way			0
many took to @entity85 guessing correctly that @entity1 was the guest comic			1
now if only we could get hold of a transmogrifier to turn this into the comeback " @entity2 " fans have been longing for			0
how ' @entity2 ' met ' @entity11 '			2

@entity1 contributed to the comic " @entity11 "
@entity1 contributed three strips
