( upwave.com ) -- every year , we like to celebrate @entity15 by indulging in some quintessentially @entity17 things , such as stout beer , strong whiskey and / or corned beef and cabbage			1
cabbage aside , those are n't exactly the cornerstones of a healthy lifestyle -- but the good people of @entity17 do know a few things about staying fit			1
according to data collected by the @entity32 in 2013 , 47 % of @entity17 men and women aged 16 and over participate in some form of regular exercise			1
while some choose common activities ( gym - based workouts , swimming , running , cycling ) , others enjoy singularly @entity17 ones like dancing ( think : @entity43 ) and the sport of hurling			1
want to celebrate @entity15 ( or any day ) in a healthy way ? here are a few @entity17 - themed workouts that 'll help you earn a @entity48 or two			1
upwave : 7 awesome things beer does for your body good : exercise like a lumberjack during the @entity17 potato famine of the 1840s , many citizens of the @entity54 immigrated to the @entity57 and @entity58 and found employment as lumberjacks and loggers in the booming timber industry			1
today , there is an exercise known as the " @entity65 , " which builds the arm and core strength needed to chop down trees			1
sure , you probably wo n't have to hew gargantuan trees anytime soon , but great arms , abs and balance always come in handy			0
here 's how the exercise works : execute a few sets of one - armed dumbbell rows while balancing on one leg with the knee slightly bent			2
be aware of your posture and try to keep your back from rounding			0
your non-weight - bearing leg should be fully extended behind you with your torso parallel to the floor , so your body makes a " t " shape			0
repeat until you feel like an @entity17 lumberjack			1
upwave : quick 5 - minute upper body workout better : give hurling a whirl believed to be the world 's oldest field game , the @entity90 sport of hurling is a mixture of soccer , hockey and lacrosse , with two teams of 15 players squaring off to put a small ball into the opposing team 's net			0
since you need 30 people for a full game , it can be hard to get one going on a whim ( unless you join a club team )			0
luckily , though ( and the @entity17 are full of luck ) , reaping the physical benefits of the sport can be accomplished without heading to the field			1
personal trainer @entity113 recommends mixing aerobic and anaerobic conditioning to train like a hurler athlete			1
some days , run two to three miles at a steady pace to build up endurance			0
other days , do a series of 50 - meter sprints to hone in on your explosiveness			0
that way , if you do ever make it onto the hurling field for a game , you 'll have the speed and the strength to play hard until the final whistle blows			2
upwave : increase your stamina in 5 days best : leap like you 're @entity131 dancing has always been an integral part of @entity17 life , comprising everything from traditional @entity17 folk dances to the vigorous step dances and jigs popularized in modern times by " @entity131 " creator @entity140			2
it 's also excellent exercise -- especially step dancing , which requires the dancer to execute intricate and rapid movements with the feet ( making it a powerful workout for both the legs and the lungs )			2
another perk of @entity17 dancing is core development , since the body and arms are mostly kept still as the dancer performs the elaborate footwork			1
upwave : quick 6 - minute core workout the benefits of getting footloose also extend beyond the physical			0
a recent study published in the @entity159 found that dancing keeps your brain nimble and can help to ward off dementia as you age			0
and because you 're listening to music while you dance , it feels like less work than comparable exercises			0
