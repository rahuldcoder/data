-- roughly 700 students at the @entity3 , @entity3 , will be given a powerful antibiotic to guard against meningitis after coming in contact with four people diagnosed with meningococcal disease , county health officials said tuesday			1
the news came as the @entity10 confirmed a fourth student at the university has been diagnosed with meningococcal disease			1
the four students all became sick with meningococcal disease , which can cause meningitis or blood infections , during a three - week period in november			1
one of them has become permanently disabled , the @entity18 said			1
the second and third students who fell ill recovered and are back in classes , @entity3 spokesman @entity20 said			2
the fourth is expected to recover , he said , but the first is still hospitalized			0
the first three cases were confirmed to be caused by type b bacteria , which is the same bacteria strain causing an outbreak of meningitis at @entity29			1
testing is not complete on the most recent case , county health spokeswoman @entity30 said in an e-mail			2
meningitis is a form of meningococcal disease , but not all four cases at @entity3 are meningitis , @entity34 said			1
although the @entity40 recommends that college freshmen living in dorms receive a meningitis vaccine , the vaccine approved for use in the @entity45 does not protect against the kind caused by type b bacteria			1
@entity3 is sending a letter to its fraternities and sororities , most of which are based off campus , asking them to refrain from large social gatherings where cups might be exchanged , @entity20 said			2
" we 're almost certain that they 'll go along with that as we head into the holiday period here , " he said			0
more than 500 students at @entity3 who were identified as close contacts of these students have received preventive antibiotics , county health officials said			1
this week , additional individuals who may have been exposed to the bacteria causing the meningococcal disease are being directed to take antibiotics			1
the school has been consulting with the county health department and the @entity40 about the outbreak , @entity20 said			0
on the opposite @entity45 coast , @entity29 announced last week that it would make an unlicensed vaccine for meningitis b available to undergraduate students , as well as graduate students living in dorms or the @entity77 and annexes , and other university community members with particular medical conditions			1
the vaccine , @entity82 , made by @entity83 , is approved in @entity84 and @entity85 but not the @entity45			0
the @entity40 's @entity86 approved the importation of @entity82 specifically for the @entity29 situation			2
" the @entity40 is the lead on the vaccine issue , " @entity34 said tuesday			0
what is meningitis b ? meningitis is caused by inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord , known as the meninges			0
infection of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord usually causes this inflammation , according to the @entity40			0
meningitis usually develops in response to bacteria or viruses , but there can be other forms and causes , such as physical injury , cancer or certain drugs , according to the @entity40			0
the bacterial form is rare in the @entity45 , and the @entity115 bacterial strains are even more rare			0
meningitis can spread via the exchange of saliva and other respiratory secretions through kissing , coughing , sharing drinks and living in close quarters , such as in dormitories , according to health officials			1
symptoms can include a stiff neck , headache , fever , vomiting , rashes , sensitivity to light and confusion			0
untreated , the disease can lead to complications such as hearing impairment , brain damage , limb amputations and death			0
antibiotic treatment of the most common types of bacterial meningitis " should reduce the risk of dying from meningitis to below 15 % , although the risk remains higher among young infants and the elderly , " according to the @entity40			2
in 2012 , there were 480 cases of bacterial meningitis in the @entity45 , according to the @entity40			2
of those , 160 were group @entity149 @entity0 's @entity150 contributed to this report .			0
