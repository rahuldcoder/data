@entity0 -- it 's the wildest dream of tea party extremists : the ultimate political comeuppance for the liberal president they love to hate			1
since the day @entity8 got elected to the @entity9 , they have wanted to force him out			0
first , it was the birth certificate			0
then , it was the bailouts			0
a succession of other allegedly impeachable issues followed : @entity15 targeting , the @entity17 terrorist attack , executive branch overreach			0
but it 's not going to happen , even if @entity20 take back the @entity21 and retain their @entity9 majority in the november congressional elections			1
here 's why : no chance : the numbers just do n't add up			2
under the most optimistic election result for @entity20 , they would be far short of the two - thirds @entity21 majority needed to convict @entity8 if the @entity9 passed articles of impeachment			1
also , a @entity1 / @entity31 last week showed nearly that two in three respondents opposed impeaching the president			2
@entity20 leaders such as house speaker @entity35 know all that , and so they 're trying to tamp down the expectations of their conservative base			1
" we have no plans to impeach the president , " @entity35 said this week			2
" we have no future plans			0
" @entity20 - led @entity9 authorizes lawsuit against @entity8 @entity44 chairman @entity43 , who may have presidential ambitions in 2016 , also quashed the possibility , saying wednesday that " this does not rise to the high crimes and misdemeanors level " of impeachment			1
' stop just hatin ' all the time ' : meanwhile , @entity8 and @entity50 talk up the threat to raise money and inspire their supporters to turn out in november			1
vote , " @entity8 told a @entity56 , @entity57 , crowd that voiced its displeasure wednesday over @entity20 tactics he criticized			1
the president cited the vote by @entity63 authorizing @entity35 to sue him over executive actions , saying @entity65 should instead be passing legislation			0
" they 're mad because i 'm doing my job , " @entity8 said of his @entity20 foes , urging them to " stop just hatin ' all the time			1
" @entity72 @entity71 : ' you bet we 're going to run ' on impeachment in debate before wednesday night 's vote , @entity77 @entity76 made sure to link the lawsuit proposal to possible impeachment down the road , calling it a first step to trying to oust the president next year			1
the issue resonates with @entity50 supporters , according to rep. @entity88 of @entity89 , who chairs the @entity90			0
the group has raised $ 7.6 million online since @entity35 announced the lawsuit plan just over five weeks ago , he said			0
" you bet we 're going to run on a @entity65 that is just obsessed with lawsuits , suing the president , talking about impeaching him instead of solutions for the middle class , talking about jobs and infrastructure , " he said			0
' not how @entity102 works ' : it all makes for grand @entity0 theater in an election year but reflects deeper political undercurrents , particularly for a right wing already divided between diehard conservatives and more moderate @entity20			1
@entity110 political scientist @entity109 called impeachment a " farfetched " maneuver that could cause independent voters leaning @entity20 now to instead vote @entity50 in november			1
" it reflects in the @entity20 the idea that if you lose an election , you can use every means possible to nullify the result , " she said			1
" that 's just not how @entity102 works			1
" @entity120 , a writer who predicted four years ago in a @entity122 article that @entity9 @entity20 would vote to impeach @entity8 before his presidency ended , said wednesday that he now doubts that will happen			2
missteps by @entity20 , including primary defeats of viable candidates by conservative extremists and the government shutdown they forced last year , " really convinced the establishment that they could n't indulge the base on all its flights of fancy , " @entity120 said			2
@entity20 pivot : now @entity35 and others want to steer their base away from impeachment , he said , noting that they fear getting pushed into holding a vote that would be politically damaging			2
in dismissing an impeachment move , @entity35 and @entity43 sought to shift the blame for any discussion about it onto @entity50 and the @entity9			0
@entity35 called it a @entity50 fundraising " scam , " adding , " they 're trying to rally their people to give money and to show up in this year 's elections			1
" @entity8 lambastes @entity20 for ' hatin ' all the time ' asked about the accusation , @entity9 spokesman @entity152 offered a list of @entity20 legislators who have discussed impeaching @entity8 in recent months , including @entity156			2
@entity157 of @entity158 , @entity159 of @entity160 and @entity161 and @entity162 of @entity163			0
the challenge to @entity35 and other @entity20 leaders is to find a middle path between tea party demands to impeach @entity8 and less extreme options for action , such as the lawsuit			1
an impeachment effort after the november election would dominate @entity0 in the final two years of @entity8 's presidency , posing possible benefits and risks			0
it would divert attention from congressional dysfunction contributing to dismal approval ratings but also could cause the public to blame @entity20 for exacerbating that dysfunction			2
" we 've got a lot of tools at our disposal , " rep. @entity182 of @entity183 said , citing such steps as cutting funding for some parts of government disproportionate to the problems			0
" nor do i think you ought to do things in a legislative sense to harass the president , " said @entity182 , who is a @entity35 ally			0
" we 've got a disagreement between the two branches , and this is not uncommon			0
you go to court , and that 's what we 're seeking to do			0
" @entity201 : the impeachment proceedings against president @entity201 and his subsequent resignation still rankle many @entity20 today , 40 years later			1
it was an event that made efforts to remove a sitting president part of routine political discussion in @entity102			1
a @entity20 - led @entity9 voted to impeach president @entity209 on charges of perjury and obstruction in 1998			1
the @entity21 acquitted him on both charges , with none of the minority democrats voting to convict , and he stayed in office			0
today , any @entity20 with presidential ambitions -- such as @entity43 , perhaps -- wants to avoid making impeachment a reflex response to dissatisfaction with the @entity9 , @entity109 noted			2
" if you want to be president some day , " she said , " the last thing you want is for @entity65 to be able willy - nilly to impeach you			0
" @entity1 's @entity224 , @entity225 and @entity226 contributed to this report .			0

@entity230 dream of ousting the president not realistic
@entity20 leaders try to tamp down far right 's expectations
democrats happy to raise money off the issue
