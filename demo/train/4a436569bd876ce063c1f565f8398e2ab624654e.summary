-- @entity2 finance ministers recommended saturday that economic sanctions be levied against the @entity6 government for its part in a bloody , months - long crackdown on civilian demonstrators , a senior @entity2 official told @entity0			1
state - run @entity10 ( @entity10 ) called the move an " unprecedented procedure ( that ) contradicts the rules of the economic and trade cooperation among the @entity16 countries and targets the @entity6 people			1
" @entity2 foreign ministers from the regional alliance will meet at 11 a.m. sunday in @entity21 ( 4 a.m. et ) to consider whether to adopt the proposal , the league official said			1
@entity23 had failed to respond to a friday deadline for it to allow @entity2 observers into the @entity27 country to monitor the government 's response to civil unrest			0
" the @entity6 responded with more requests to amendments to the protocol ; they did not reject or accept , " a senior @entity2 diplomat said			2

in addition , all assets belonging to the @entity6 government and its officials would be frozen so they could n't be accessed , and @entity6 officials would not be allowed to visit @entity2 countries			1
pictures on @entity10 's website on saturday showed people packed in the city of @entity52 , reportedly to decry " the @entity2 decisions and foreign interference in the @entity6 internal affairs			1
" @entity57 foreign minister @entity56 has said @entity6 risked international isolation if it continued along its present path -- adding that the reported violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests could not be tolerated			2
" @entity6 has to make a decision , " he said in @entity62 alongside his @entity64 counterpart , @entity63			2
" it will either continue this crackdown policy against its people and become isolated more and more , or it will say yes to this well - intentioned @entity2 proposal , sign this protocol and observers will monitor the situation on the ground by going to all @entity6 cities			2
" meanwhile , more violence was reported in @entity6 on saturday , with the activist group @entity77 claiming that at least 29 civilians -- among them , four children -- had been killed			1

" the martyrs were killed in the line of duty by the armed terrorist groups in the governorates of @entity104 , @entity81 and @entity87 , " that report said			0
" the families of the martyrs expressed pride in their son 's martyrdom , ... stressing that @entity6 will remain steadfast in the face of the conspiracy which targets its unity and stability			2
they said that the @entity6 people will overcome this ordeal through national unity , and that the blood of the martyrs will protect @entity6 and make it stronger in the face of challenges			0
" @entity0 can not independently verify reports from either side , since @entity6 's government has limited access to international news organizations			1
since march , protesters in cities across the country have been demanding president @entity131 's ouster and democratic elections			0
the @entity133 estimated earlier this month that more than 3,500 @entity6 have died in the subsequent government crackdown , said @entity135 , a spokeswoman for the @entity136			0
@entity138 's government has consistently blamed armed gangs for the violence			0
adding to the pressure on @entity23 , the @entity141 said friday it is " deeply concerned about gross and pervasive human rights violations in @entity6 , " which are allegedly taking place " in a context of impunity			0
" " of particular concern are reports referring to children who have suffered torture and mutilation while detained ; as well as cases of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ; arbitrary detention by police forces and the military ; and enforced and involuntary disappearances , " said @entity148 , who heads the expert panel			1
reliable sources indicate the abuses " are allegedly conducted under direct orders from public authorities , at their instigation or with their consent or acquiescence , " @entity148 said			0
