-- photographer @entity2 's show , " neighbors , " consists of photographs taken of the residents of a building near his studio in @entity9 through the windows of their apartments			1
a few residents , unaware they were being photographed , have raised objections			1
in this column , @entity2 explains his process and his work			1
my art practice has led me down many and varied paths of visual exploration -- from landscape photographs of @entity23 to portraits of sock monkeys , chewed dog toys and medical museum specimens			1
currently , in collaboration with the @entity29 , i am working on a long - term portrait project with a group of autistic teenagers			2
given my background as a special education teacher , i find this a particularly rewarding homecoming			2
first and foremost , my practice seeks out the inner life -- the essence -- of my subjects , whether they be human or inanimate			1
i use my camera as a writer uses text , to create a narrative that helps the viewer understand what might lie hidden or obscured			1
this narrative , at times only a whisper or suggestion , weaves throughout my bodies of work			2
some time ago , i began photographing the occupants of a neighboring building through the windows			1
i 've lived in @entity57 , in @entity58 , for 30 years , and have built my life and studio here			0
the area has gone through many changes , and i watched the building across the way built from the ground up			1
made entirely of glass and steel , it offers residents views of the neighborhood -- and neighbors and passersby views into the apartments			0
as people filled the empty units , i was intrigued not only by the implied stories within the frame of the glass but also by the play of light upon the subjects , the shadows , the framing of the structure			2
i do n't photograph anything salacious or demeaning -- instead i record the turn of the head , the graceful arc of a hand , the human form obscured by drapery			0
the photographs make up a show called " neighbors , " which opened a week ago at the @entity95 in @entity9 , and some people have raised concerns			0
i am not photographing the residents as specific , identifiable individuals , but as representations of humankind			0
in fact , i take great care in not revealing their identity ; the strength of the imagery comes from us seeing ourselves in the anonymous figures of " the neighbors			0
" in @entity9 , people are masters of being both the observer and the observed			0
we live so densely packed that contact is inevitable -- even our homes are stacked facing each other			0
it is no wonder that street photography was born in this city , and some of the best subjects and most famous works are the results of those who did n't know they were being photographed or painted			1
" neighbors " has sparked a good bit of conversation			0
while people differ in their opinions -- as most do when it comes to art -- i believe the images speak for themselves			2
i encourage everyone to draw their own conclusions after seeing the work			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

fine art photographer @entity2 's artworks *encompass* many subjects
@entity2 photographed occupants of nearby building through the windows
their faces were hidden , but some objected because they were unaware of camera
@entity2 says portraits are *powerful* because we recognize ourselves in them
