@entity0 -- who 's afraid of a harmless course in @entity6 - @entity5 studies ? arizonans			1
in the immigration debate , the state that has demonstrated that it is terrified of changing demographics and determined to run off @entity15 seems afraid of its own cultural footprint			1
we 're talking about courses in @entity6 - @entity5 history being taught to high school students of all colors and backgrounds in the @entity24			1
concerned that teachers are presenting material in a biased and inflammatory manner , a posse of elected officials , education bureaucrats and school board trustees -- made up of @entity32 and @entity33 -- are trying to shut down the district 's @entity34			1
those wrongheaded efforts got a boost last week when , at an administrative hearing , state administrative law judge @entity38 -- relying on auditors that had surveyed only a few classes -- found that the program was being taught in an inappropriate manner			2
it 's rare that you find ethnic studies at the k - 12 level			1
maybe that 's because parents and communities are sometimes uncomfortable with the subject matter			0
i bet you could go into most high schools in the @entity5 , and you 'd find @entity5 history textbooks that make no mention of the @entity58 , the birth of the @entity61 union , the @entity62 and a long list of other seminal events experienced by @entity6 in this country			1
and given that @entity15 account for 16 % of the @entity5 population and are projected to make up twice that percentage in a few decades -- and that @entity6 and @entity69 - @entity68 account for about two - thirds of the @entity71 population -- that sort of blind spot does n't serve anyone 's interests			1
@entity15 have to learn about the culture and institutions of the mainstream			0
why should n't those in the mainstream have to reciprocate and learn a little something about @entity15 ? that 's not only fair , but also wise			2
these days , it 's hard to be wise in @entity84			1
an ominous state law passed by the legislature in 2010 bans courses that teach " racial resentment " or are " designed for a specific ethnic group " or advocate " ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals			1
" under the law , the state can withhold 10 % of the funding for a school district -- in the case of @entity99 , about $ 15 million a year -- until the district changes the courses or eliminates them			1
in writing his opinion , @entity38 charged right into the debate with the grace of , well , a right - wing radio talk show host			0
" teaching oppression objectively is quite different than actively presenting material in a biased , political , and emotionally charged manner , " @entity38 wrote			0
" teaching in such a manner promotes social or political activism against the white people , promotes racial resentment , and advocates ethnic solidarity , instead of treating pupils as individuals			0
" as an example of the harm supposedly done by such courses , he brought up one lesson that taught students that the historic treatment of @entity6 was " marked by the use of force , fraud and exploitation			2
" and so ? is n't that true ? and is n't the same thing true of @entity130 , @entity68 and @entity131 ? are these the next groups to be bullied ? so we wo n't teach the ugly chapters of @entity5 history			1
why not just have the textbooks written by @entity137 ? here 's what this is really about			0
a group of people is afraid that the tables are being turned , and that they will eventually lose power and suffer retaliation			1
so they 're portraying themselves as victims of a new oppression			0
this view is shared by @entity33 and @entity32 alike			0
this is n't about partisanship			0
and losing your place in line			0
@entity84 , the problem child of the @entity161 , has it backward again			2
in recent years , state officials have made it awfully clear where they believe @entity15 belong in the social pecking order			0
that was the message when artists hired to paint a mural at a school in @entity172 were told to " lighten " the face of the child at the center of the drawing because people objected that the figure was obviously @entity71 -- before the school came to its senses and retracted the order			2
that was the message when state lawmakers passed a tough immigration bill that encouraged ethnic profiling by deputizing local and state police to enforce federal immigration law based on who they suspect is in the country illegally			1
and that was the message when state education officials went so far as to bar instructors who are determined to have heavy accents from teaching @entity196 language classes			0
opponents of ethnic studies think knowledge is dangerous			0
but what 's the alternative ? take a good look at what 's become of @entity84 and consider the perils of ignorance			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity208			0

@entity84 judge rules for group trying to stop school district 's @entity6 - @entity5 studies
