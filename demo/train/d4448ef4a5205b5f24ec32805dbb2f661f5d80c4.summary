@entity0 -- it 's the hardest question in @entity0			1
in the twilight hours of saturday , when the people of @entity0 were breaking the daily @entity5 fast , fireballs illuminated the night sky			1
the @entity8 military was intensifying its assault on @entity0 militants in the @entity12 neighborhood near @entity0			1
the battle had only just begun			2
as dawn broke sunday , some barefoot , many looking dazed and haggard flooded from their smoldering neighborhood			1
thousands walked along sidewalks , packed into cars , and piled onto donkey carts with only what they could carry : some clothing , a bit of food			2
most just had clothes on their backs			2
when @entity1 put this question to one @entity12 resident , with his family in tow , he broke into tears			1
" where are you going ? i just do n't know , " he replied			1
nearby explosions prodded the family forward into the unknown			2
a barrage of rockets @entity0 militants respond with a barrage of rockets			1
another fleeing family waited for a car to ferry them to safety , but one member was missing			1
" my mother refused to leave , " said @entity49			2
" she told me to leave her to die , but i will try to go back			2
" a temporary cease - fire later gave a @entity1 crew a glimpse of the inferno being fled			1
for many of those able to make it out , their destination will be the @entity61 schools that have been turned into centers for those displaced			1
by sunday afternoon , at least 81,000 people had arrived at 61 @entity61 schools , and the number was likely to rise			1
it 's the largest number of internally displaced gazans since @entity8 pulled out of the coastal strip in 2005			1
a human surge found its way to the @entity72			2
the classrooms overflowed with civilians moving quickly without direction around the compound			2
the schoolyard is also a place for the latest news from home			2
one man found out his brother had been killed			2
no information yet about other members of his family			2
when word came that the shelter was full , rumors of a nearby school with space sent a stampede of families off again into the unknown			0
more than 60 killed for hundreds of @entity95 's residents , safety never came			1
the lucky ones received a ride to a hospital			0
the @entity99 put the neighborhood wounded at more than 400			1
more than 60 were killed			0
" there are more women and children this time around and the doctors are shocked and depressed , " said @entity101 with international aid group @entity102			0
@entity101 pointed to the lack of medical supplies which she describes as " chronic and becoming more acute			0
" officials at the hospital braced for an influx of injuries they know will come from @entity95			0
" many people are underground , " said dr. @entity114 , general manager of @entity115			0
" we could not reach those people to extract them and there are surely dead people and wounded people and others will die if we ca n't get to them			1
" to retrieve those stuck in @entity12 , the @entity122 called for a ceasefire			0
for a moment the guns fall silent over @entity95			0
pleas for help entering the densely populated neighborhood of roughly 100,000 residents , a @entity1 crew found a woman pleading for help			1
" my son is in the house , " said @entity131			0
i called the @entity134 , i called for an ambulance but no one came			0
can you help ? " on one street , a twisted pile of metal lay on the side of the road			0
only the burned frame of a steering wheel revealed that it was any type of vehicle at all			0
in front of it was another ambulance -- its windows blasted out and its back door ajar			0
bandages spilled into the rubble - strewn street			0
glass , pavement , and leaves mixed with gasoline			0
snapped power and telephone lines hung from crooked poles			0
the smell of death mingled with the fumes of fuel			0
paramedics rushed one motionless body away on a stretcher			0
a steady stream of ambulances rushed in and out of the shattered neighborhood , sirens wailing			1
a sense of urgency a sense of urgency gripped the remaining fleeing residents who refused to stop long enough to talk			1
they were on edge , alert for the presence of any nearby @entity8 soldiers			0
a local journalist whispered , " do n't stay long			1
it 's not safe here			1
" he saw two men armed with @entity187 assault rifles slink away with purpose			0

it ultimately was extended until 5:30 p.m. @entity192 , a young father holding his 1 - year - old daughter , @entity193 , said he was going to take his family to a nearby @entity61 school			0
" it 's full , it 's full , " he shouted			1
@entity192 , like many others , then had to ask himself @entity0 's toughest question , where would he go ? @entity201 : @entity8 seeks ' sustainable quiet ' with @entity0 life in @entity0 : search for safety , or wait for destiny			1
