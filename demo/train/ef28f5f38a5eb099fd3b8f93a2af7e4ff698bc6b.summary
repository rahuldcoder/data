-- his black robes and turban may harken back to @entity5 rulers from 1,500 years ago , but @entity7 's taste in wrist - wear is decidedly more 21st century			1
days after the mysterious leader of the @entity12 terror group @entity11 was purportedly filmed at a mosque in northern @entity14 calling on believers to wage " jihad " against @entity17 's enemies , social media is ablaze with speculation on the make of @entity22 's watch			1
but while critics claimed that the flashy silver timepiece dangling from the @entity5 warlord 's wrist was a luxury western watch worth thousands , his supporters say he was actually wearing a relatively more modest $ 560 " @entity30 watch " from @entity31 , a @entity32 - based watchmaker			1
the deluxe stainless steel @entity34 -- the preferred choice of " true @entity36 , " according to some commentators on social media -- can be programmed with the correct prayer times for hundreds of cities around the world			2
the watch can be set to ring before each " azan , " or call to prayer , wherever the wearer happens to be , according to the @entity31 website			0
@entity36 pray five times a day , and prayer times are based on the movement of the sun , so they can vary in different places within the same city			0
in addition to the prayer alarms , the @entity54 - made watch has a built - in compass to indicate the direction of @entity59 , @entity30 's holiest site , so believers will know what direction to pray			1
the bilingual watch displays in @entity63 and @entity64 and allows you to choose either the @entity67 or @entity68 calendar , which is " based on the astronomical moon sighting at @entity59 , " according to the watchmaker 's website			0
the deluxe model also has a @entity74 bookmark feature which enables you to record the last @entity75 and @entity77 number so you can pick up where you left off later			2
an employee at the watchmaker told @entity0 : " we ca n't be sure 100 % that the watch [ @entity22 ] was wearing was actually ours , but after seeing the picture we can assume it is the @entity82			1
though the @entity64 signs were not clear , the watch 's shape is identical to ours			0
" " there is no record about who bought what from the more than 30 branches we run			0
while we do n't have branches in @entity14 , we do have them in many other countries , among them 11 @entity5 countries and even @entity100 branches such as the one in the @entity101 , " the employee added			2
@entity11 has not commented on the watch @entity7 was wearing , but observers claimed earlier this week that one of the world 's most wanted men was wearing either a @entity107 or a $ 5,000 @entity108 -- the timepiece of choice for @entity111 , the world 's most famous silver screen spy			1
critics of @entity22 -- the ringleader of the @entity117 splinter group whose lightning - quick advance has seen them seize large swathes of land in @entity121 and @entity14 in recent months -- say his flashy silver timepiece contradicted with his attempt to strike a pose of pious humility during his sermon at the mosque in @entity128			1
" the ' @entity131 makes his first appearance wearing expensive @entity108 or @entity107 watch , " said one observer on @entity130			2
" new ' @entity134 ' spotted with serious bling , maybe he needs that @entity54 precision to know it 's time for the @entity138 ? " joked another			0
regardless of the brand , @entity22 , like @entity140 before him , wore the watch on his right arm in accordance with @entity145 tradition dating back nearly 1,500 years to the @entity146 , who encouraged all @entity36 to prioritize the right side of their bodies as they go about their daily lives			0
@entity151 's appearance in @entity128 came days after @entity11 declared him as the leader of a new state extending from @entity155 in northeastern @entity121 to the @entity156 in @entity14			0
@entity0 could not independently verify the video 's authenticity , but the video did identify the man as @entity161 , the name @entity22 now goes by with his followers since @entity11 declared the creation of their so - called caliphate , or " @entity166			1

@entity176 was purportedly filmed giving a sermon at a mosque in northern @entity14 last week
observers claimed on social media that the @entity5 warlord was wearing an expensive @entity184 watch
others now claim he is wearing an " @entity30 watch " that sets prayer *reminders* and has a @entity74 bookmark function
an employee at @entity31 , the @entity32 - based watchmaker , tells @entity0 that @entity22 's watch " appears to be one of ours "
