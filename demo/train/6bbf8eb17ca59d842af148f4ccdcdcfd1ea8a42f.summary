-- @entity1 claimed a controversial 2 - 0 victory at home to @entity4 on saturday night to keep up the pressure on @entity7 leaders @entity8			1
@entity1 stayed within five points of the defending champions , who came from behind to beat @entity12 2 - 1 earlier in the day , following a bizarre incident late in the match at @entity15			1
@entity16 was allowed to put the ball into the @entity4 net while goalkeeper @entity19 was trying to take a free - kick , after the @entity22 midfielder handled when he went down having vainly claimed a penalty			1
the linesman instantly flagged , but referee @entity25 over-ruled him and awarded @entity1 a second goal to the fury of the visiting team -- who have been on the wrong side of several controversial decisions at @entity15 in the past decade			2
@entity1 boss @entity32 said @entity16 had correctly played to the whistle			2
" @entity16 looked back and looked at the referee , and the referee said play on , so what can he do but put the ball in the net , " @entity32 said			2
" you can look at the referee and look at the linesmen and blame them , but the goalkeeper should know better			0
he 's an experienced goalkeeper			0
i thought he made a mess of it			0
" i thought it was a penalty first of all and i think @entity16 felt he handled the ball			2
but the referee did n't blow for it			0
" fifth - placed @entity4 extended their historically dreadful run at @entity1 's home ground to 21 years without a victory , but had been in the match until the 84th - minute incident			1
@entity53 hit the base of the @entity4 post in the eighth minute , but @entity57 midfielder @entity56 rattled his compatriot @entity58 's woodwork with an even more spectacular effort just after the half - hour mark -- a day after the goalkeeper 's 40th birthday			2
@entity1 took the lead five minutes later as @entity4 paid for poor defending , with @entity68 center - back @entity66 stealing in unmarked to head home @entity16 's curling free - kick			1
@entity58 then did well to keep out a fierce shot from @entity72 , but @entity4 lacked the potency to equalize despite their smooth passing game , with boss @entity75 bringing on @entity76 and @entity77 to replace @entity78 and @entity56			2
@entity8 , still missing injured @entity80 midfielder @entity79 , needed an 84th - minute winner from @entity82 to see off @entity12 , who earlier in the week announced the club is poised to be the first in the @entity7 to have @entity87 owners			1
@entity89 striker @entity88 had headed a 21st - minute opener for his first goal for @entity12 , from @entity93 's cross , but former @entity95 striker @entity94 leveled three minutes before the break after @entity97 nodded down @entity99 's cross			2
@entity12 could have led again in the 81st minute but striker @entity100 missed a golden chance , and the @entity102 immediately pounced for the winner as @entity68 defender @entity82 headed home @entity106 's cross			0
" @entity12 could have scored before our goal and we were a little bit lucky , " @entity8 coach @entity108 told reporters			1
" to win here was important because they were better			0
we were not great again			0
@entity12 put us under some pressure and we were not able to play our football			0
" @entity116 claimed second place on goal difference above @entity1 after snatching victory at home to bottom club @entity121 , with @entity122 heading a late winner following an end - to - end @entity125 derby			1
@entity95 midfielder @entity127 hit the crossbar with a long - range free - kick and @entity80 winger @entity130 struck the post after coming on as a substitute , while former @entity80 goalkeeper @entity133 kept the visitors in the game with a series of fine saves			0
but @entity139 international song finally broke the deadlock with two minutes to play with a diving effort from fullback @entity143 's cross			0
@entity116 manager @entity144 told reporters that captain @entity146 should be available for wednesday 's @entity148 trip to @entity150 's @entity149 despite suffering a hamstring twinge			0
however , @entity153 's hopes of a first league crown since 1968 were dented by a second successive defeat , this time at lowly @entity156 , which left the club eight points behind @entity8			0
beaten 3 - 0 by @entity116 last weekend , @entity153 went ahead in the 23rd minute with a penalty from @entity160 -- who was partnered up front by @entity163 in the absence of injured captain @entity165			1
but @entity68 midfielder @entity166 equalized on half an hour and @entity167 -- who headed against the post in the first period -- gave @entity170 a first win since the opening day of the season with a 57th - minute strike			0
but @entity170 remained second from bottom on goal difference below @entity177 , who travel to @entity179 sunday			1
@entity180 moved up to seventh place with a 1 - 0 win at home to @entity184 , with @entity186 striker @entity185 scoring his first goal since april in the 67th minute			1
@entity188 climbed to eighth with a 2 - 0 victory against @entity190 , with @entity192 international @entity191 netting both goals in the first half for the home side .			1

@entity1 third on goal difference after beating fifth - placed @entity4 2 - 0
win marred by late controversy surrounding second goal scored by @entity16
@entity8 earlier maintained five - point lead with 2 - 1 victory away to @entity12
@entity116 claim second place after snatching late 1 - 0 win at bottom side @entity121
