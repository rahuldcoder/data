on the eve of peace talks , photos of alleged mass torture in @entity2 gruesomely illustrate the difficult task before @entity7 - led negotiators to end the country 's civil war			1
on tuesday , a day after the photos were revealed by @entity12 , a prominent @entity2 opposition group charged the pictures demonstrate " industrial killing " by president @entity16 's regime			1
the @entity17 also urged world leaders tuesday " to exert all possible pressure on the regime to step aside and allow @entity2 to realize their desire for a free country			1
" @entity24 deputy spokeswoman @entity23 said the photos underscore how negotiators need to establish a political transition and " get the @entity16 regime out of power			1
" " these most recent images , i think presented by your network first , are extremely disturbing , " @entity23 said			2
" they are horrible to look at , and they illustrate apparent actions that would be serious international crimes			2
" a preliminary session for the peace talks , dubbed @entity38 , will begin wednesday in @entity39 , @entity40 , and the formal international talks will commence friday in @entity38 between the @entity2 government and opposition delegations			1
even as @entity7 secretary general ban ki - moon arrived tuesday in @entity40 , controversy roiled over how the @entity7 rescinded an invitation to @entity47 to join the talks , with @entity50 officials saying it was a mistake but " not a catastrophe			1
" @entity47 , accused of supporting the @entity16 regime , announced monday it would not attend the conference because it objected to preconditions seeking a transitional government			0
the @entity17 , however , said @entity47 's attendance would have been " a deal - breaker			2
" " continued @entity50 and @entity47 support for the regime is the main obstacle to finding a solution to the violence in @entity2 , " the coalition said in its tuesday statement			2
meanwhile , in @entity38 , delegations to the conference continued arriving tuesday as media outlets awaited their reaction to photographs purporting to show " systematic torture and killing " of detainees by the @entity16 regime			1
could photos be a game changer ? that assertion is being made by a team of internationally recognized war crimes prosecutors and forensic experts , who analyzed thousands of digital photos taken and provided by a @entity2 defector codenamed " @entity82 , " who , along with his family , is now living outside @entity2 in an undisclosed location			1
the experts ' report was partly sponsored by the government of @entity90 , which funded the @entity92 law firm @entity91 to write it			0
@entity90 and @entity93 provide most of the outside support for @entity2 's rebel forces			2
the experts advancing the report are @entity98 , the first chief prosecutor of the @entity99 ; sir @entity100 , the former chief prosecutor of the same special court ; and professor sir @entity103 , former lead prosecutor against former @entity106 president @entity105			0
they shared their findings in a joint exclusive this week with @entity12 's " @entity110 " and @entity112 newspaper			0
the experts contend their analysis -- based on thousands of photographs of the dead bodies of alleged detainees killed in @entity2 government custody -- would stand up in an international criminal tribunal			1
in the photos , lifeless bodies show signs of starvation , brutal beatings , strangulation and other forms of torture and killing , according to the report			1
4 things to know about @entity2 in one group of images of 150 individuals examined in detail by the experts , 62 % of the bodies showed emaciation -- severely low body weight with a hollow appearance indicating starvation			1
the majority of all of the victims were men most likely between ages 20 and 40			0
stomachs , faces and even legs are concave -- sunken , rather than convex			0
on some torsos , bruising and bleeding is so severe that the victims ' skin is a mosaic of black , red , purple and pink			0
@entity158 and parallel wounds , a mix of bruises and torn skin , line one man 's chest and torso , covering every inch of the victim 's body from neck to pelvis			0
the forensics team identified the neck bruising as consistent with strangulation with a rope , piece of rubber , or other such object , as opposed to the marks that would be left by a hanging			0
@entity180 likened the images to those of @entity184 survivors			0
the emaciated bodies were the product of starvation as a method of torture , " reminiscent of the pictures of those ( who ) were found still alive in the @entity193 death camps after @entity194 , " de @entity100 said in a @entity12 interview			0
the report asserts the killing was orchestrated by @entity2 's highest levels of government			1
haunting images of @entity2 's abandoned homes a complex numbering system was used to catalog the corpses , with only the relevant @entity2 intelligence service knowing the identities of the corpses			1
it was an effort , the report says , to keep track of which security service was responsible for the death , and then later to provide false documentation that the person had died in a hospital			0
@entity12 can not independently confirm the authenticity of the photographs , documents and testimony referenced in the report and is relying on the conclusions of the team behind it , which includes international criminal prosecutors , a forensic pathologist , an anthropologist and an expert in digital imaging			0
the report draws its evidence from the testimony of a defector dubbed " @entity82 " and almost 27,000 photographs he provided ; in all 55,000 such images were taken out of the country			0
@entity82 worked as photographer in the military police , and once the war broke out , his work consisted entirely of documenting " killed detainees , " the report said			0
he claimed to have photographed as many as 50 bodies a day			0
at one point he took the unusual step of photographing a group of bodies to show that it " looked like a slaughterhouse , " according to the report			2
refugees starving to death in @entity2 camp the fact that all the bodies were photographed , the report 's authors say , strongly suggests that " the killings were systematic , ordered , and directed from above			2
" it is also possible that far from being a systematic plan to document human rights abuses , photographing the bodies was the unexamined continuation of a long - time practice			0
@entity2 is not a member of the @entity259			2
the only way the court could prosecute someone from @entity2 would be through a referral from the @entity7 @entity264			1
but because of @entity50 's support for the @entity16 regime , and because it has veto power on the council , such a referral seems unlikely , at least for now			0
more than 100,000 people have been killed in @entity2 since the revolt against @entity16 began in march 2011 , the @entity7 says			1
a communique by last year 's @entity274 conference calls for a transitional government and eventual free elections as part of a political settlement to end the war			0
@entity280 has called for this week 's conference to include a focus on " fighting terrorism " in @entity2			2
throughout the civil war , @entity2 has blamed violence on " terrorists			1
" in a meeting with @entity2 's delegates to the talks , @entity16 directed them to preserve their nation 's sovereignty by " preventing and rejecting any foreign interference no matter its form and context , " @entity2 's state news agency , @entity287 , reported monday			1
@entity280 also said no political solution could be reached without the agreement of the @entity2 people and " first and foremost the complete cessation of terrorism " and its support by other countries , the news agency said			2
