-- @entity1 defended thursday its right to explore outer space after reports that a rocket , believed by the @entity6 to be a long - range missile , had been positioned on its launch pad			1
replicas of @entity11 and @entity1 missiles are displayed at the @entity12 in @entity13			2
@entity1 recently informed a pair of @entity16 agencies that it plans to launch a satellite			1
the launch is believed to be slated for sometime between april 4 to 8 , according to @entity19 , @entity11 's state - sponsored news agency			2
@entity1 's announcement has triggered international consternation			2
@entity6 and @entity11 officials have long said the @entity1 is actually preparing to test - fire a long - range missile under the guise of a satellite launch			1
@entity27 lashed out against critics on thursday in a commentary reported in the state - run @entity31 news service			0
" this is nothing but a groundless outcry of the political philistines ignorant of any legality of the study of space science for peaceful purposes , " the commentary said			0
" outer space is not a monopoly of a few specified powers but an asset common to mankind and the space development is promoted worldwide at present			1
" should anyone have the right to explore space ? the @entity6 has no plans to shoot down the @entity1 rocket , @entity6 secretary of state @entity47 said wednesday in an interview with @entity0 's @entity51 , but will raise the issue with the @entity53 if @entity27 carries out a launch			1
" we are doing our best to dissuade the @entity1 from going forward , because it is provocative action , " @entity55 said			1
" it raises questions about their compliance with the @entity62			0
and if they persist and go forward , we will take it up in appropriate channels			0
" @entity1 is technically capable of launching a rocket in as little as two to four days , according to @entity67 , an expert at the @entity68 , but who doubts a launch will come that soon			1
it would not make sense for @entity27 to make such a move after going through official channels with its plans , @entity67 said			0
" @entity77 could delay the launch if they experience problems with the weather , or within the leadership , but i do n't see any reason why they would fire it ahead of time , " @entity67 said			0
what the @entity1 would be testing may not be known until an actual launch , @entity6 officials have said			1
a @entity53 resolution in 2006 banned @entity1 from conducting ballistic missile activity			2
@entity91 officials said they could shoot down the object whether it is a missile or a satellite			0
" as the @entity16 resolutions prohibit ( @entity1 ) from engaging in ballistic missile activities , we still consider it to be a violation of a technical aspect , even if ( the @entity77 ) claims it is a satellite			1
we will discuss the matter with related countries based on this view , " @entity91 foreign minister @entity100 said this month			0
@entity11 echoed @entity55 's statements			0
" the @entity11 government believes that if the @entity1 conducts its launch despite continuous warnings of the @entity11 government and the international community , it is a provocative action that constitutes a serious threat to the security of northeast @entity115 and the @entity116 , " said @entity106 spokesman @entity105			1
" the launching of the long - range rocket is a clear violation of the @entity120 , and we strongly urge @entity1 to immediately stop such measures			2
" the @entity123 missile is thought to have an intended range of about 6,700 kilometers ( 4,200 miles ) that -- if true -- could strike @entity125 or @entity126			0
