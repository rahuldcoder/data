-- some athletes earn the right to be considered a sporting legend			2
few , in truth , are truly deserving of such an honor			2
but there can be no quarrel over the greatness of @entity10 's @entity9 who , in a career spanning 16 years , has redefined the art of long - distance running			1
@entity9 during the epic 10,000 meter final at the @entity15 in 2000			1
it is regularly described as one of the greatest track races of all time			2
born in the rural town of @entity21 in the central province of @entity23 , @entity9 was seven years old when the @entity10 @entity24 triumphed in the 10,000 meters final at the @entity25			1
listening to the victory on the family radio the feat implanted not only a desire to run , but also a belief that it was possible for @entity10 athletes to succeed at the highest level			2
@entity9 soon took up running			1
poor transport services in @entity10 necessitated that he regularly run 10 kilometers to school and back with his books tucked under his left arm			2
when he began to run competitively -- he won his first 1500 meter race at primary school when he was eight years old -- he ran with a crooked arm , as if the books were still there			0
but the bent arm did n't hinder him and it has remained a distinctive feature of his running style ever since			1
spurred on by his physical education teacher , @entity9 started training after school			0
extra sessions running around his father 's farm soon reaped rewards as he began to win not only local but regional races			1
when he was 15 years old , he and his brother joined an athletics club in @entity55 and tried to make the national team			0
the young @entity9 's devotion to running initially annoyed his father , who implored his son to forge a career as a doctor or a teacher , but he kept up his training schedule and the more he practiced , the faster he got			1
in 1992 , the same year he met his future wife @entity64 , a 19 year - old @entity9 won the 5,000 and 10,000 meter finals at the @entity66			0
the following season his senior career would take off in spectacular fashion			1
at the @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity71 he claimed the 10,000 meter title			0
the following year he broke his first world record -- 5,000 meters at a meet in @entity75 , @entity76 -- surpassing the time set by the @entity79 @entity78 seven years earlier			1
1995 produced further extraordinary success			0
not only did @entity9 retain his world 10,000 meter crown -- he would eventually win four -- but he clocked three world records in just 71 days			2
still only 23 years old , his fledgling career reached its pinnacle when he won the 10,000 meter @entity86 gold at @entity87 in 1996			1
in doing so , @entity9 had emulated his boyhood hero @entity24			0
the next four years saw @entity9 go unbeaten over 5,000 and 10,000 meters , smash records indoors and out -- taking his career world record tally to 15 -- and star in the 1999 @entity93 movie " @entity94 " which chronicled his life			1
his triumph over his great rival , @entity98 @entity97 at the @entity15 in 2000 is perhaps his most famous race			2
@entity9 -- who had spent the weeks prior to the games struggling with an achilles tendon injury -- piped @entity97 on the line by 0.09 seconds to retain his 10,000 meter @entity86 title in dramatic fashion			1
the victory secured him national hero status at home in @entity10 , and hundreds of thousands of fans cheered him through the streets of @entity55 in a homecoming parade			0
his attempts to win an unprecedented third @entity86 title in @entity113 in 2004 were dashed by a recurrence of the achilles tendon injury			1
any sense of personal disappointment -- it is difficult to tell as @entity9 has always worn a smile in triumph or defeat -- was replaced with elation as his protégé and countryman @entity124 took the gold medal			0
the previous year @entity9 had finished runner - up to @entity124 in the @entity127 10,000 meters in @entity128			0
@entity9 soon turned his attentions away from the track and began to focus on road running , in particular the half - marathon and the marathon			2
in 2006 , he duly added the half - marathon world record to his collection and in september 2007 he broke the marathon world record in @entity137 to register his 25th world record mark			1
now 34 years old , his body shows no signs of fatigue -- physical or mental -- and he retains a hunger to achieve			0
whatever happens in the future , his performances merit a permanent place in the pantheon of truly great sportsmen			0
off the track , @entity9 has maintained his links with @entity10 , choosing to live and work in @entity55			0
he remains committed to promoting the @entity10 cause , not always through charity -- although he lends his vigorous support to numerous projects -- but by repeating the mantra of reward through hard work			0
there can be few better role models for sport and life than he .			0
