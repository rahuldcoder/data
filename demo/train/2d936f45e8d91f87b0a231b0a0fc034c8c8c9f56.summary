-- i saw @entity2 in " @entity3 " and saw @entity5 's " @entity4			1
" i saw @entity6 do " @entity8 " and why @entity7 was a " 10			2
" i saw the 1919 @entity9 sell out baseball in " @entity11 " and the 1961 @entity14 belt out baseballs in " 61 *			1
the one movie i wrote in my mind a hundred times and on paper nine or 10 times , though , was " 42			1
" of course , it was n't called that 20 - odd years ago when i was under contract to be the @entity24 biopic 's screenwriter			1
and i have zero to do with the " 42 " -- named for @entity24 's uniform number -- that will slide into a theater somewhere near you on friday			1
it nonetheless will leave me a little choked up			2
@entity31 once described @entity32 as the one place where you can " die from encouragement			2
" well , once upon a time , i was encouraged to bring @entity24 's life story to the screen , only to be discouraged by the way reel life turns out			1
the buzz on " 42 " is strong			1
@entity24 's widow , @entity41 , 90 , was guest of honor at a recent @entity43 showing where @entity44 said , " we think everybody in this country needs to watch this movie			1
" a long overdue film , " 42 " features an up - and - comer , @entity50 , as the infielder who changed the face of baseball , and @entity54 , of all people , as the insider who held open the door to the big leagues			1
@entity59 found a few fake treasures in his day , but @entity62 's unveiling of @entity24 was a true discovery for the ages			1
i spent many hours with @entity41 cramming to learn details of the life they shared			2
i went to her family 's foundation in @entity70 to pore over documents and correspondence			1
i tapped away on the @entity73 on a clunky early ' 90s computer , not knowing that this cinematic masterpiece i was eager to deliver was doomed			2
who was i to do @entity24 's story ( and hers ) justice ? oh , no one			1
i so wanted to hit it out of the park for her			2
when i failed , well , do n't we all ? it began in the late ' 80s			2
it had occurred to me that a mighty figure of @entity87 sport and african - american culture had been insufficiently immortalized on film			1
the man i mean is , naturally -- well , not @entity24 , but an equally monumental gent			1
apart from being a heavyweight champ , @entity92 was a model citizen , a military vet and a true difference - maker when too many men and women were still struggling to become color - blind			1
a script called " @entity92 " was born			1
it was co-written by myself and a @entity102 journalist friend , @entity101 , as a specific look at a 1930s span when @entity92 lost to the popular @entity105 to whites ' delight , only to transform into a red - white - and - blue hero in their eyes , triumphing in the rematch against a @entity113 example of so - called white supremacy			2
we fought to get it made			0
producers and options came and went			0
during which time we discover what quite a few of @entity32 's movers and shakers want more and more of , beyond all else			1
they want more @entity125 to them , it is n't the story of a man			0
it is the story of two men			0
a black man and , hey , guess what , a white man			0
think of who we could cast ! " would n't it be great , " a producer babbled at one point , " if we could get @entity140 for this ? " " for what ? " i ask			0
" for @entity125 " " i have a couple of questions , " i reply			0
" why would a movie star play a guy who ends the movie by getting his ass kicked ? and how do we explain why @entity105 is built like @entity151 ? " with logic that makes me laugh to this day , he says : " hey , if you can get @entity140 , you get @entity140			1
the other stuff will work itself out			0
" a good thing does happen , though			0
someone familiar with our script slips a copy to @entity41 , in the hope she will give her blessings to @entity101 and me taking a crack at mr. and mrs. @entity24 's remarkable tale			1
we are told who the producer will be -- he has a few noteworthy credits -- and a deal is cut			0
@entity170 is backing the movie , ostensibly to air on @entity173			1
a meeting is held in a packed @entity173 conference room			0
@entity41 expresses reservations -- it does not escape her eye that there is no non-caucasian in the room -- but life is short and she is willing to give it a shot			0
" the @entity186 " is under way			0
at first , we keep the title of the 1950 film , in which the title role was played by the man himself			1
in 1990 , @entity193 airs one called " @entity194 of @entity24 , " based on an experience in the @entity196			1
i remember @entity41 being pleased by @entity199 's portrayal of @entity200			1
( note : i have never heard @entity41 call her husband by any name but " @entity200			0
" ) it is 1991			0
i have a full - time job -- @entity206 sportswriter -- which i have made clear must come first			0
i spend all morning and afternoon in @entity70 at the @entity208 , conferring with @entity41 and doing research			0
i catch a 5 p.m. flight to @entity211 for a baseball playoff game , cover it , catch a dawn plane to @entity70 , repeat the previous day			1
i nearly collapse at 5 as i run to grab a cab			0
i hear my producer tell my partner : " he 's not putting in enough time on this ! " nothing is ever enough			1
the writers are never right			0
the producer wants it one way			0
@entity41 wants it a different way			0
he wants the baseball years			1
she wants the life beyond baseball			1
we write it both ways			1
both hate it both ways			0
no one else -- not the producer , not @entity41 , not anyone from the studio , not our agent -- ever speaks to me again			0
worse , the film is killed			2
i read in @entity245 's column in the @entity246 that director @entity247 is teaming up with @entity41 to do a @entity24 movie			1
hey , who better ? i had long thought @entity247 to be the right man to do the right thing by 42			2
@entity245 writes that documentarian @entity251 was to do a film , but neglected to consult @entity41 first			2
she is quoted : " i really felt , and i still feel , that a black man can understand another black man and all the nuances of his life better than anyone else can			0
" i do not disagree			0
i read a story on how @entity247 's option has expired			2
a quote from @entity41 : " he could n't put all the pieces together -- the studios , the funds , the star , the script			2
it 's not the first time the project has been aborted			2
i 've been trying to get a movie done for the past 15 years and have n't succeeded			1
but i wo n't give up			0
that 's right , that 's how long it took			2
@entity41 , you made it			0
i know writer - director @entity276 made it and @entity50 made it and @entity54 made it , but you made it			0
you have your whole life			0
i give it thumbs - up and , hey , i have n't even seen it .			0
