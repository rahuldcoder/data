wait ! were these really the @entity2 that we watched on sunday night ? could n't have been			1
where was the rampaging snark or the woozyboozy stage patter we 've hated to love -- or vice versa -- year after year ? it was a @entity2 ceremony on its best grown - up behavior			1
the outside world was more present than usual at this year 's show , with a few shout - outs of freedom - of - speech solidarity with the victims of last week 's deadly @entity16 terrorist attack in @entity17			1
the topical jokes from co-hosts @entity19 and @entity21 -- including a couple of pointed ( and not too shabby ) impressions of a lascivious @entity24 -- landed deftly enough , though the running gag featuring @entity26 as a grim - faced @entity28 representative of the @entity30 press may have gone on slightly longer than it needed			1
in fact this year 's show seemed to work harder than ever to keep the traffic flowing and the loose ends from dangling			2
even those who were glumly pretending at humiliation ( looking at you , @entity37 ) or succeeded at humiliating themselves ( maybe we wo n't see your movie on friday after all , @entity41 ) did n't seem to have their hearts in it			0
for the most part , there was so much deportment , grace and dignified good intentions on display that you 'd have thought you were watching the @entity52 or something ! and they 're not the @entity52			1
that much has n't changed			0
voters for the @entity57 , a group of about 90 who write about movies and tv for the international press , have very little connection with or bearing upon the thousands of actors , directors , cinematographers , producers , writers , directors and other movie trades people who 'll be voting on the @entity52			1
but perhaps this year , more than any other in recent memory , people peered into the @entity2 to get an early sense of who 's got the legs to score big			1
that 's because after a year that movie pundits considered among the more dismal in both overall quality and box office returns , there has n't been a movie showing big - footed momentum heading into awards season			1
the verdict ? cloudy , but with some signs			0
@entity87 's prize for best actor in a comedy or musical seemed to signal a big night for " birdman , " which also won for best screenplay			0
but " @entity98 " scored the best comedy or musical @entity95 , while " boyhood " won for best drama			0
" @entity101 's " front - running status for best picture is likely solidified after winning so many year - end critics ' awards			2
sunday night 's audience -- which by the way contained far more people who will cast @entity52 votes than it did @entity57 voters -- seemed most galvanized when @entity112 awarded the best original song @entity95 to @entity114 and @entity115 for collaborating on the song " glory " from " @entity118			1
" in his acceptance speech , @entity114 further roused the house by saying , " i realize i am the hopeful black woman who was denied her right to vote			0
i am the caring white supporter killed on the front lines of freedom			0
i am the unarmed black kid who maybe needed a hand but instead was given a bullet			0
i am the two fallen police officers murdered in the line of duty			0
' @entity118 ' has awakened my humanity			2
" it 's not improbable that those listening may find themselves feeling the same way in a few weeks when they fill out their @entity52 ballots			2
the outside world has a way of intruding on the bigger show , even in a year where there was more to be nervous about than inspired by .			0

@entity143 : @entity2 shed snarky vibe for more sober ceremony this year
topical jokes *touched* on @entity28 , @entity24 ; there were solidarity shout - outs to @entity150
@entity152 : *enthusiasm* after " @entity118 " best song win may be a hint at where @entity52 will go
