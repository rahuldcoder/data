-- the @entity2 assault on a mall in @entity4 , @entity5 , is alarming for its audacity , its scale and the sophisticated planning that went into it			1
both the choice of target and method of attack exactly fit the new @entity14 playbook			2
few counterterrorism experts are surprised that the @entity17 group launched another attack in the @entity5 capital			1
it has threatened to take revenge ever since @entity5 forces entered @entity2 's heartland in southern @entity17			1
small - scale attacks , frequently with hand grenades , have already brought bloodshed to @entity4 's streets			0
back in september of last year , @entity5 authorities said they had disrupted a major plot to attack public spaces in @entity4 in its final stages of planning			2
authorities also broke up a plot by the group against @entity37 tourists in the city in late 2007			0
but the scope of the assault on the @entity41 -- and especially its eerie similarities to the attack in @entity44 , @entity45 , in 2008 -- show that @entity2 has taken its ability to strike outside @entity17 to a new level			1
only once before has the group caused such carnage in @entity50 , when bombers attacked bars and restaurants in the @entity55 capital , @entity56 , on the night of the @entity57 in 2010			0
more than 60 people were killed			0
@entity2 said the attacks were in retaliation for @entity55 's leading role in the @entity63 force supporting @entity17 's weak government in @entity65			1
but the attack on the @entity41 is very different , involving perhaps 10 or more heavily armed assailants , using multiple entrance points to lay siege to a high - profile venue in an upscale neighborhood			0
the assault then evolved into a hostage - taking to garner maximum publicity			0
@entity2 grew amid @entity17 's lawlessness @entity2 says the attack took months of planning and training , and as it unfolded the group kept up a running commentary on its @entity82 feed			1
" the @entity83 entered # @entity41 today at around noon and are still inside the mall , fighting the # @entity85 ( infidels ) inside their own turf , " it said			2
@entity88 the operation ticks the boxes that @entity14 leader @entity91 listed in a message published just over a week ago			1
ensure the target is @entity37			0
the @entity41 has several @entity95 establishments and is popular with expatriates			0
those killed include three @entity101 citizens , two @entity102 nationals and two @entity103 , their governments said			0
in his september 13 message , @entity91 warned against attacks on non-western states unless the regime was part of " the @entity110 forces			1
" @entity5 , with its long tradition of @entity113 governments and close relationships with @entity37 militaries , fits that bill			2
@entity91 recommended taking " the citizens of the countries that are participating in the invasion of @entity122 countries as hostages so that our prisoners may be freed in exchange			2
try to avoid @entity122 casualties			0
@entity2 claimed on its @entity82 feed that the gunmen escorted @entity122 out of the mall , before turning on the " disbelievers " inside			2
witnesses said the gunmen at the @entity41 tried to identify @entity122 by asking shoppers the name of @entity136 's mother			0
they shot those who did n't know			0
@entity4 is vulnerable to @entity2 attacks not least because of the large @entity17 community , many of them refugees from the country 's long - running clan warfare , that lives in the @entity144 district			1
known as " little @entity65 , " @entity144 is now home to an estimated 250,000 @entity17			2
and @entity2 is well established there , raising money , finding recruits and setting up safe houses			2
@entity2 also has an ally in the militant @entity5 group @entity152 , formerly the @entity151 , which has a strong presence in @entity144 and in the coastal city of @entity155			1
investigators will be examining whether @entity152 played a role in the attack on the @entity41			2
@entity5 @entity152 militants are suspected to have been responsible for several of the small - scale terrorist attacks that have hit the country			1
@entity162 : how @entity2 picks its targets this is a worrying trend , analysts say			2
while @entity2 's @entity17 fighters are not used to operating abroad , @entity166 have been training with the group in southern @entity17			1
@entity152 is the most potent outgrowth of that training			0
founded in an @entity144 mosque in 2008 , @entity152 took advantage of growing radicalization among a minority of @entity5 's 4.3 million muslims to build a significant presence in @entity4 and @entity155			1
investigators established the group had close links to the attacks in @entity56 in july 2010			0
according to the @entity183 on @entity17 , most of the operatives who conspired in the attack were @entity5 and close to @entity152 leaders			1
a crackdown against @entity152 by @entity5 authorities , helped by the @entity110 , has weakened the group			1
according to a 2013 @entity195 report , " @entity152 members were plagued by unexplained killings , disappearances , continuous ' catch and release ' arrest raids and operational disruptions			0
" but @entity152 is far from defeated			0
according to the @entity195 report , it has established links with @entity2 affiliates elsewhere in @entity50 and is enlisting the services of fighters returning from @entity17 " to conduct new and more complex operations			1
" its leadership has become closer to @entity14 through figures such as @entity204 , known as " @entity205 , " who is said to favor large - scale attacks in @entity5 in support of @entity2			1
@entity2 has other valuable alliances in the region , including the government of @entity212 , which sees it as a useful ally against its arch - enemy @entity215			1
a @entity195 @entity183 reported in 2011 that financial records and shipping movements indicated @entity212 's support for @entity2 went far beyond the humanitarian			1
in a 400 - page report , it concluded that @entity212 's relationship with @entity2 seemed designed to " legitimize and embolden the group rather than to curb its extremist orientation or encourage its participation in a political process			1
" @entity2 has also established a relationship with @entity228 in @entity229 , from which it obtains weapons and training , according to counterterrorism officials and former members of both @entity228 and @entity2			0
one former jihadist tells @entity0 the relationship began in 2008 when he linked up a senior figure in @entity2 , @entity238 , with the @entity229 cleric @entity239			0
in september 2011 , the @entity240 warned that @entity2 , @entity241 in @entity242 and @entity243 were trying to synchronize their efforts to launch attacks on @entity110 and @entity37 interests			0
@entity17 jihadists recruit in @entity110 , @entity103 and @entity248 @entity5 incursion the @entity5 capital became much more vulnerable to retaliation when @entity5 troops and tanks , supported by airstrikes , moved into @entity17 in october 2011 in response to growing cross-border violence			1
@entity2 immediately warned that the incursion would have " cataclysmic consequences			0
" what was meant to be a limited engagement dragged on			0
it took a year for @entity5 forces to capture the port of @entity263 , but in doing so they dramatically raised the stakes for @entity2			1
according to the @entity195 , @entity2 used to collect an estimated $ 35 million to $ 50 million annually in custom tolls and taxes on businesses in @entity263 and two secondary ports higher up the coast -- about half its entire estimated annual income			0
its expulsion from @entity263 changed the dynamics for @entity2			0
previously the group held off plotting large - scale attacks in @entity5 because of @entity5 's importance for recruitment , logistics and fund - raising			2
@entity2 commanders realized a crackdown by law enforcement on @entity17 interests in @entity5 would be devastating to the @entity17 business community , creating a backlash against it in @entity17			1
but after they lost control of @entity263 , the gloves came off			0
in march , @entity2 warned @entity5 they would not " sleep safely " in @entity4 as long as their soldiers were in @entity17			1
and in the midst of the siege , the group tweeted : " for long we have waged war against the @entity5 in our land , now it 's time to shift the battleground and take the war to their land			2
" " the attack at # @entity300 is just a very tiny fraction of what @entity122 in @entity17 experience at the hands of @entity5 invaders , " another tweet said			1
it 's notable that @entity2 was able to plan and train for such a sophisticated attack despite losing much territory in southern @entity17 and around the capital , @entity65			1
as it has lost ground , the group has resorted to suicide bombings			0
earlier this month it carried out a bomb attack against a restaurant popular with @entity315 in @entity65 , killing more than a dozen people			0
a @entity195 report issued in july noted that @entity2 " has shifted its strategic posture to asymmetrical warfare in both urban centres and the countryside " but added that it " continues to control most of southern and central @entity17			1
" the report estimated the military strength of @entity2 at about 5,000 fighters , with a functioning chain of command , and said it had " preserved the core of its fighting force and resources			0
" after years of infighting and feuds , the @entity4 attack may also confirm the ascendancy of @entity2 's most militant faction and its leader @entity334 ( aka @entity335 )			1
@entity334 attended a madrassa in @entity337 as a young man and merged the group with @entity14 in february 2012			2
he sees @entity2 as part of @entity14 's global jihad			1
dissenters have defected or been killed			0
sheikh @entity343 of @entity2 's old guard surrendered to @entity17 authorities			1
and earlier this month @entity334 reportedly ordered the killing of two @entity37 militants who were critical of his leadership style and had aligned themselves with @entity343 -- @entity349 and @entity350			0
@entity349 was an @entity110 from @entity351 who had become a prominent mouthpiece for @entity2 before publicly criticizing @entity334 last year			0
@entity334 's increasingly tight grip on @entity2 -- thanks to his ruthless use of the group 's intelligence wing in hunting down opponents -- appears to have forestalled the collapse of @entity2 , and may have made it more dangerous			2
@entity334 has threatened a direct attack on the @entity110 , and last year the @entity110 offered a $ 7 million reward for information locating him			0
it would be very surprising if the attack in @entity4 did not receive his blessing , and it may be a sign of things to come as @entity2 takes its war to other parts of @entity50			2
of more immediate concern to @entity5 authorities , in a country where political violence can explode quickly , is a likely backlash against @entity17 and @entity5 muslims , which could create a new cycle of radicalization and unrest .			2

@entity2 has threatened revenge on @entity5 ever since @entity5 forces entered @entity17
mall attack shows @entity2 has taken its ability to strike outside @entity17 to a new level
the operation meets *criteria* that @entity14 leader @entity91 listed in a recent message
@entity2 allies in region include @entity5 militant group @entity152 and @entity212 government
