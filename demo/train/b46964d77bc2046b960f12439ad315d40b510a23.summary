when @entity1 the elephant was rescued after being shackled and abused for five decades , the story and picture of him " crying " went viral			1
his rescuers say he apparently cried first while he was still in his captor 's custody			0
his rescuers describe the tears as " gushes of liquid " coming out of his eyes , pouring down both cheeks			0
they say he looked like he was in a lot of pain			0
" it was a very emotional moment for us , because we 've never seen an elephant cry like that , " says @entity17 , co-founder of @entity18			1
" the rescue occured in @entity24 , @entity25 state , on july 4			0
video and images were published three days later and have since registered well over a million views on @entity29			0
even though a team of 10 wildlife experts and 30 enforcement officers were involved in @entity1 's rescue , it took eight hours to free the malnourished elephant			1
@entity17 says the shackles , laden with spikes , were tied so tightly around @entity1 's wounded legs that after they unchained him , he cried again			2
this time , they appeared to be tears of joy			0
" i do n't know how scientific this is , but it seemed like he understood that we were there to help him , " @entity17 said			0
different owners , repeated cruelty it is not known whether elephants can cry , but experts say they 're known to be emotional animals			1
but @entity1 's story goes far beyond the tears he shed , whether of pain or joy ; it puts the spotlight on a much larger animal - rights issue in @entity59			1
@entity1 's rescuers believe he was poached soon after he was born , and that he was sold again and again			1
he may have had up to 27 owners			0
they believe @entity1 was beaten severely , and say the weapons used against him look like they belong in a torture chamber			2
the idea was to " show the elephant who is boss , " says @entity67 , another @entity18 co-founder			1
@entity1 was forced to work as a " begging prop " -- on the side of the road , at temples -- and sometimes was rented out for weddings and other celebrations			2
all the while , his rescuers allege , he was kept in line with beatings and starvation			0
tradition is a huge obstacle it is illegal to trade or commercially exploit elephants in @entity59 , but the practice is common			1
since 2011 , @entity59 - based @entity18 has rescued 11 elephants subjected to torture			1
they 've also rescued thousands of captive bears , leopards and monkeys			0
still , there are more than 3,000 elephants still living in captivity in @entity59			1
@entity67 says the biggest challenge is changing the people 's mindset ; tradition is a grounds for justifying every kind of cruelty against captive elephants			0
the animals have been used in @entity59 weddings as a vehicle for the groom			0
they also are kept in temples as representations of the @entity108 elephant @entity109			0
" it is ironic that @entity59 worship the elephant god , the monkey god ... but when it comes to protecting animals , the majority do n't understand , " @entity17 says			2
and , in a country of 1.2 billion people , many of whom live in poverty , animal rights have yet to become a priority			1
@entity1 is now healing from his wounds and getting care among the other rescued elephants			1
a veterinarian said an elephant @entity1 's age and size should weigh between 4,500 and 4,800 kilos ( around 5 tons ) , but @entity1 is only half that weight			2
while many of the elephants can move around freely , experts say it will take years for @entity1 to learn to accept the kindness of human beings			2
but for now , at last , he 's free			0
