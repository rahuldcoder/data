-- like millions around the world , i owe my early career choices to the @entity4			1
as a 6 - year - old , i stayed up " late " one sunday night to watch the @entity4 explode onto the world stage on " the @entity7			1
" there were the saturday afternoons i walked to the @entity9 in downtown @entity10 , @entity11 , to watch " help ! " and " @entity13			2
" i thank @entity14 for my love of percussion , which manifested itself via paint brushes and coffee cans until i could get real drums			2
fast forward a number of years , and i was an honest - to - goodness musician , touring the world with a number of recording artists			1
i had a gold record on the wall			2
december 8 , 1980 , was an off day			2
on the road with jazz - grass fiddle wizard @entity29 , we were somewhere in @entity30			2
we stayed the night there so a tv crew could follow us the next day as we arrived in @entity33 for a series of shows			1
the hotel room tv was on " @entity37 " when the world changed			2
sportscaster @entity39 told us that @entity40 had been shot and killed that night in @entity33			1
share your own memories of that day our trip to @entity33 took on a different meaning			1
it was dreary and rainy and cold the next morning as we drove toward the city			0
after sound check , the road manager and i took the subway up to @entity51 and began walking up @entity52 toward the @entity53 , the apartment building where @entity40 lived and where he was shot			1
as we walked along the sidewalk , it was like someone had thrown a sad , gray , wet blanket on the city			0
there was traffic on the streets , but the streets were quiet			0
there were people talking as they scurried , but the air was mute			0
and as we approached the @entity53 , we noticed a flock of birds circling above the building			0
as if they were standing guard , mourning			0
" @entity73 's " @entity72 on @entity40 then , from around the corner , we heard the serenade of " @entity76 " and " imagine " from the hundreds of fellow fans			1
there was so much sadness that day , so many tears , yet it was overshadowed by peace and love and memories			0
i 'll never forget it			0
when my son was born in 1987 , we named him @entity53			0
some years later , i traded in life on a tour bus for a different seat , watching history			1
i traded in the recording studio control room for the @entity0 control room			0
thirty years later , the @entity4 , and @entity40 , live on			1
so does the hope -- that someday the world will give peace a chance			0
