-- @entity1 won all three of tuesday 's @entity3 presidential primaries , putting more distance between himself and his closest contender , @entity5 , who indicated he plans to fight on to his home state of @entity7 and beyond			1
@entity1 's wins in @entity9 , @entity10 and the @entity11 put him past the halfway mark to the 1,144 delegates needed to clinch the nomination and add to a wide delegate lead that he holds over the other major @entity3 presidential candidates , according to @entity0 estimates			1
yet @entity5 indicated tuesday night he would compete in the april 24 primaries in five states , including @entity7 , where his campaign hopes a win would be a gateway to a run of may primaries in states where he can capitalize on higher percentages of conservative voters			1
@entity1 , in a speech to supporters in @entity32 , made no mention of his @entity3 rivals and instead mostly contrasted himself with president @entity35			1
" this has really been quite a night			0
we won a great victory tonight in our campaign to restore the promise of @entity41 , " @entity1 said			1
he continued his criticism of @entity35 's economic polices and what he repeatedly called @entity35 's plan for a " government centered society			0
" " there is a basic choice that we 're going to face : the president has pledged to transform @entity41 , and he spent the last four years laying the foundation for a new government - centered society			0
i will spend the next four years rebuilding the foundation of an opportunity society led by free people and free enterprises			0
" the former @entity60 governor is expected to take the majority of @entity9 's 42 delegates and @entity10 's 37 delegates , with some designated solely for the winner and the rest to be awarded proportionally			0
he will take all 16 delegates at stake in the @entity11			0
counting partial allocations for @entity9 and @entity10 , and full allocations for @entity11 , @entity1 has collected 648 delegates since the primary and caucuses began in january , according to @entity0 estimates			1
that 's more than twice the 264 delegates @entity5 is estimated to hold			1
@entity76 and @entity77 trailed well back			0
@entity3 delegate count delegate calculator with 93 % of the vote reported in @entity9 , @entity1 had 42 % and @entity5 , a former @entity41 senator from @entity7 , had 38 %			1
@entity41 rep. @entity77 of @entity81 had 12 % , and former house speaker @entity82 had 6 %			0
in @entity10 , with 75 % of the vote reported , @entity1 had 49 %			1
@entity5 had 29 % , @entity76 had 11 % and @entity77 had 10 %			1
in the @entity11 , with 99 % of the vote reported , @entity1 had 70 %			1
@entity77 had 12 % and @entity76 had 11 %			0
@entity5 was not on the @entity11 ballot			1
@entity10 results @entity11 results pre-primary polls appeared to show @entity9 's contest was the only one tuesday that @entity5 had a chance to win			2
and analysts said @entity9 might be @entity5 's final chance to slow @entity1 's march toward the @entity3 nomination			1
@entity9 exit poll @entity10 exit poll but @entity5 told supporters in @entity98 , @entity7 , on tuesday night that the race was essentially at halftime , with only roughly half the available delegates awarded			1
" @entity7 and half the other people in this country have yet to be heard , and we 're going to go out and campaign here and across this nation to make sure that their voices are heard in the next few months , " @entity5 said			1
@entity5 , who has touted himself as a more conservative candidate than @entity1 , also warned supporters that the @entity3 often has fielded moderate @entity3 against incumbent @entity112 presidents , only to see the moderate @entity3 lose			1
he appeared to raise @entity113 , a conservative who defeated @entity116 in 1980 , as an example for a way forward			0
" if we 're going to win this race , we ca n't have little differences between our nominee and president @entity35			0
we have to have clear , contrasting colors , " @entity5 said			2
" ... time and time again , the @entity3 establishment and aristocracy have shoved down the throats of the @entity3 and people across this country moderate republicans because , of course , we have to win by getting people in the middle			0
there 's one person who understood we do n't win by moving to the middle			0
we win by getting people to the middle to move to us and move this country forward			0
" president @entity35 , meanwhile , clinched the @entity112 presidential nomination tuesday with primary wins in @entity10 , the @entity11 and @entity9 , @entity0 projected			1
unlike the @entity3 , @entity35 faces no serious opposition in his race			0
according to @entity0 's delegate estimate , the president had 2,735 of the 2,778 delegates needed to secure his party 's nod before tuesday 's contest			1
he is expected to win most or all of the 119 delegates at stake in @entity10 and @entity11 , as well as the 100 delegates at stake in @entity9			0
on the @entity3 side , since @entity1 's double - digit victory in @entity155 two weeks ago -- followed by a wave of some of the @entity3 's major names and elder statesmen endorsing him and urging a quick conclusion to the divisive nomination battle -- the conversation seems to have changed : the @entity3 front - runner increasingly being called the inevitable nominee			1
@entity9 exit polls show that endorsements might have helped @entity1			2
about 60 % of respondents said the @entity1 endorsements were a factor in their votes , and 33 % called them an " important " factor			2
most of those voters broke for @entity1			2
@entity0 chief political correspondent @entity174 reported that @entity1 's campaign was prepared to spend " a lot of money and a lot of candidate time in @entity7 , " where polls show @entity5 's once - large lead has shrunk			1
@entity5 's campaign points toward may , which looks friendlier for him			2
he could be the favorite in primaries in @entity187 and @entity188 on may 8 , @entity189 on may 15 , @entity190 and @entity191 on may 22 and @entity81 a week later			0
but it could be too little , too late by may			0
sen. @entity193 won most of the final contests against sen. @entity35 in the marathon 2008 @entity112 presidential nomination battle			2
but in the end , it did n't matter			0
and @entity199 , a @entity0 contributor and former @entity203 @entity202 spokesman , said that while he believed that @entity5 earned the right to fight through @entity7 , the race was all but over			1
" i think the writing is on the wall			0
does @entity208 want to read it is the question , " @entity199 said			0
@entity1 and @entity35 on tuesday seemed to be turning their attention to november 's general election , with @entity1 blasting the president during a campaign stop in @entity9 and @entity35 mentioning @entity1 in a speech for the first time this year			2
speaking at a restaurant in @entity218 , @entity9 , @entity1 suggested @entity35 wants to duck responsibility " for what 's happened in this country , " saying the president should get full credit or blame for " what 's happened in this economy , and what 's happened to gasoline prices under his watch			2
" " it is time to have somebody who will take responsibility , and if i am president , i will not only get things right again , i will take full responsibility for my errors and make sure that people understand we have a president in the @entity202 again where the buck will stop at his desk , " @entity1 said , while standing with @entity231 chairman @entity230 , a prominent @entity232 who endorsed @entity1			2
later tuesday , @entity35 mentioned @entity1 while slamming a @entity202 - passed budget proposal that @entity230 drew up and @entity1 embraced			2
@entity35 , speaking at a media luncheon in @entity11 , said the plan , which would lower tax rates and cut spending while reforming the @entity252 and @entity253 government - run health care programs , was " thinly veiled @entity254 " and " antithetical to our entire history as a land of opportunity and upward mobility for everyone who 's willing to work for it			0
" " one of my political opponents , gov. @entity1 , has said that he hoped a similar version of this plan from last year would be introduced on day one of his presidency , " @entity35 said			2
" he said that he 's very supportive of this new budget and he even called it marvelous , which is a word you do n't often hear when it comes to describing a budget			0
" while @entity1 is far ahead of @entity5 , @entity76 and @entity77 in the hunt for delegates , exit polls have indicated @entity1 still has a problem locking in the conservative base of the party			1
that continues to fuel @entity5 's campaign , in which he continually depicts himself as the lone true conservative going up against the @entity3 establishment and liberal media bias			2
as in previous contests , @entity9 's early exit polls showed @entity1 doing better among higher - earners and @entity5 better with lower - income voters			1
among exit - poll takers making $ 100,000 to $ 200,000 annually , @entity1 led 55 % -30 % , with @entity5 winning the under - $ 30,000 voters , 44 % -34 %			1
