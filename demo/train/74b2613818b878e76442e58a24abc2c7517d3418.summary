in honor of the @entity2 , this story will be 7,633 words long , padded out with flowery phrases and belabored metaphors , leavened with a surprise adjective or two and summed up by a yawning and expected conclusion			1
well , at least about the number of words			2
we ca n't promise anything about the rest			2
but that 's the thing about the @entity2			1
so much of what they present ( and represent ) is predictable : amusement and pageantry , self - importance about the role of movies and occasional stretches of dullness			1
( well , there are 24 awards to give out			2
) still , you never know when the show will surprise -- and even entertain			2
this year , for the 87th @entity2 , the " entertainment " portion will be helped immeasurably by the inclusion of host @entity32 , who has proven himself to be an all - star performer with his turns at the @entity35 and @entity36			1
and a number of award categories -- including best picture -- are still undecided , unlike recent years when many top winners seemed preordained			2
so grab some popcorn and an @entity2 ballot			1
here 's what you can expect from this year 's show			0
who should win an @entity2 ? cast your vote @entity49 is gone			1
the comedian and longtime red - carpet maven died last september , and love her or hate her , she always added some zip to the red - carpet procession , from popularizing the question " who are you wearing ? " to calling out faux pas on " @entity58			2
" this year 's red carpet -- coverage begins at 7 p.m. et -- is less colorful for her loss			0
nevertheless , plenty of color ( and color commentary ) will remain			0
@entity65 and @entity66 are hosting on @entity67 , while @entity68 will trot out @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			1
the weather forecast calls for a partly cloudy day with temperatures in the mid- 60s and a 10 % chance of rain			0
sparkling @entity2 weather , in other words			1
when @entity32 hosts your show , you know you 're in for a good time			1
his song - and - dance moves at the @entity35 -- which he 's hosted four times -- have earned raves			1
and though the @entity86 proved unexpectedly dull , he was n't blamed			0
so now @entity87 is hosting the @entity2			1
it wo n't be @entity32 ' first time on the @entity2 stage -- he opened the show in 2010 -- but it 's his debut as the show 's emcee			1
he 's aware of the challenges			0
@entity96 did a good job last year , but all anyone remembers is her selfie			0
and @entity100 , another ace song - and - dance man , hosted the show in 2009			2
recall anything else ? " in many ways , it 's lose - lose , " @entity32 told the @entity107			1
" there 's so much scrutiny			0
and so much anticipation , and so many ( oscar - viewing ) parties where people are hoping that things go wrong			2
it 's not really an audience wanting you to win			0
" the 42 people scheduled to hand out awards sunday range from 80 - year - old @entity120 to 18 - year - old @entity121 , from perennial nominee @entity122 to newcomer @entity123			1
perhaps in an effort to appeal to younger viewers , only five of the presenters are over 50			0
and the academy may be mindful of complaints this year about the all - white slate of acting nominees			2
more than one - quarter of the scheduled presenters are black , including @entity134 and perceived best actor snubee @entity135 , both from " @entity137			2
" yes , reading off lists of nominees can be a little dull			0
so who 's going to bring the funny ? we 're pinning our hopes on @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144			0
count on @entity2 for @entity147 ( best actress , " @entity153 " ) , @entity148 ( best supporting actor , " @entity154 " ) and @entity150 ( best supporting actress , " boyhood " )			1
after that things get less predictable			0
best actor is a two - way race between sentimental favorite @entity158 ( " birdman " ) and upstart @entity160 ( " @entity162 " )			1
and best picture ? " birdman " appears to have a slight edge over " boyhood , " with " @entity167 " as a long - shot contender			1
some people think " @entity172 's " blockbuster status gives it a chance , but liberal @entity175 may be loath to reward a movie so beloved by right - wing @entity177			2
oscars 2015 : who will win and who should win if you 're looking for a full slate of predictions for your @entity2 pool , @entity181 is a pretty good handicapper			1
by now , after the @entity188 , the @entity189 and other awards shows , we have some idea of what the front - runners might say if they win			1
based on recent history , @entity158 may get teary and thank his handsome son @entity195 , while @entity160 and @entity147 might dedicate their awards to people coping with als and @entity200 's , respectively			0
@entity150 might mention her lineage as a descendant of actors , and @entity148 may thank " @entity154 " co-star @entity204 for how he " inspired me every day to want to scream at him and hit him in the face			0
" in recent years , the academy has n't really known what to do with the songs			0
occasionally they 're a highlight -- @entity216 's " things have changed " and @entity219 ' " @entity218 " come to mind -- but , more often , they 're an excuse for a bathroom break , or not performed at all			0
this year features five songs with intriguing back stories			0
you 've got " glory , " the gospel - tinged @entity226 - @entity225 collaboration that 's one of just two nominations received by " @entity137 " ; @entity231 's puckish " everything is awesome ! " , the only nomination for " the @entity233 " ; " i 'm not gon na @entity235 , " a wrenching swan song from the @entity200 's - stricken @entity237 ; " @entity238 , " from the overlooked " beyond the @entity240 " but written by the anything - but - overlooked @entity239 ; and " @entity242 , " from " @entity243 , " which was directed by " once 's " @entity244 and performed by @entity246 's @entity245			2
" glory " will probably win -- it 's been justifiably celebrated -- but for once , best song may be one of the strongest categories at the @entity2			1
( all except for @entity237 's song are being performed by the original artists ; @entity253 will sing " i 'm not gon na @entity254			0
" ) find other moments to go to the bathroom			0
producers @entity257 and @entity259 have also promised " several musical sequences " featuring such names as @entity264 and @entity265 , according to the academy 's website , and " @entity266 " songwriters @entity268 and @entity269 are writing a number for @entity32			1
did we mention @entity272 is back ? a year after he mangled singer @entity274 's name as " @entity275 , " @entity272 has somehow been invited back to redeem himself as a presenter			0
( maybe they 'll ask him to introduce best live action short film , where @entity279 , @entity280 and @entity281 await			0
) let 's be honest : many of us watch the @entity2 not for the awards but for the high - wire risks of live tv : the fumbled speeches , the wardrobe malfunctions , the chance that someone will do or say something crazy			1
@entity293 , @entity294 and @entity295 will be speaking live , too			0

the 87th @entity2 air sunday night on @entity68
host will be @entity32 , who has proven himself at the @entity35 and @entity36
" birdman , " " boyhood " are front - runners for best picture
