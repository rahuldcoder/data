-- an attorney for a @entity3 teacher who admitted to raping his 14 - year - old student is asking the judge in the case to cancel a hearing scheduled for friday			1
in a response filed thursday with the @entity10 , attorney @entity8 joined prosecutors in saying that the new hearing would be " without legal authority			2

the case drew widespread attention when district judge @entity20 imposed the 30 - day sentence on @entity22 and made controversial comments about the victim , saying she " seemed older than her chronological age			1
" in an order this week , the judge said that it now appears the mandatory minimum is two years , not 30 days			2
he said the court , " if necessary and appropriate , " would amend the sentence at friday 's hearing			1
such a hearing , however , would " create confusion and uncertainty for all parties left to interpret and execute the sentence of mr. @entity38 , " @entity8 argued			2
he said his client contends the sentence imposed , which prosecutors are appealing , is lawful and appropriate			1
also thursday , prosecutors filed an emergency petition with the @entity44 , asking it to stop the scheduled hearing			1
while acknowledging " the district court 's effort to correct the error at the trial court level , " they wrote that the " only remedy prescribed by statute and case law is appeal before this @entity10			0
" further , the september 6 hearing , if permitted to be conducted , will undermine the @entity57 's appeal and otherwise frustrate the just and orderly administration of ordinary appeal processes , " the petition read			0
