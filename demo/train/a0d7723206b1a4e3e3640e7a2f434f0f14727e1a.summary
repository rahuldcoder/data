-- when i visited @entity2 on monday , i took a walk past the @entity5 dormitories on @entity6 before speaking about my career to a student seminar -- the same one i took 10 years ago			1
every time i see the entrance to @entity11 , i am overcome with disbelief that my friends and i are n't still students			2
i consider it a cruel and unusual fact of life that there is a learned student living in my 171 square feet of paradise			1
but we all had to move on , and i am happy			2
i 'm 29 , i live in @entity22 , i work at @entity0 , and i did not marry a @entity23			1
@entity25 's letter to the @entity23 advising female students to find a husband on campus is surprising in its antiquated assumptions , for sure			1
@entity31 strategist and @entity0 commentator @entity30 and others have taken it apart for its focus on marriage over career and its pointedness toward male - female relationships			1
i do n't fault anyone for wanting their college romances to continue , and i know some that have			1
but in my experience , parts of her letter are out of whack with the realities of college today			1
i 'm sure @entity2 was different for the class of 1977 , when @entity54 graduated			1
there were only 200 women			2
( @entity2 began admitting women only in the fall of 1969 ! ) she wrote that it was seen as " heresy " for her to say she wanted to get married and have children			1
in my generation , the gender breakdown on campus is nearly 50 - 50 , and i never felt even a little unwelcome as a woman			2
i heard people express the wish to have a career , marriage and children			2
but it was far from the only thing we talked about			0
we talked philosophy , politics , religion , diversity , journalism , anthropology and the value of higher education ; that 's the level of dialogue that i craved when i applied in the first place			2
@entity54 writes about how freshman women should be " a little nicer " to senior men , as though women never date men younger than themselves in college , and therefore , there are fewer to choose from as each new class graduates			2
as a freshman , i barely even knew any seniors			0
i 've heard i seemed " nervous " and " spazzy " in my first year			0
i lived in fear of sounding stupid , getting subpar grades and locking myself into a major i did n't like			0
i was probably less emotionally prepared to have a serious relationship than at any other time in my college career			1
seven years after graduation , i understand how difficult a college marriage , the kind @entity54 suggests , could be			2
many of my good friends from @entity2 are in @entity107 programs across the country or are practicing lawyers or doctors , teachers or nonprofit administrators or , like me , journalists			1
in order to have those great careers , though , a lot of us had to move around			0
we had to take jobs or attend graduate programs that were very far away from our idyllic @entity121 town and far away from each other			0
i know some @entity2 couples who did the long - distance thing and are now engaged or married			1
let 's be clear : they did n't get married in college , but the hard work of balancing two careers in flux can work out			1
personally , i could n't have done it			0
this is not a @entity2 problem			1
this is a 22 - year - old problem			0
there is this truth in @entity54 's letter : when you live in close proximity to thousands of other people your age , it 's not unreasonable to hope that you will meet at least one other person who captures both your heart and mind			1
intelligence is sexy , so a lot of really smart people are going to casually hook up or date or both			0
@entity2 is a place that brings together some of the most fascinating people i have ever encountered			1
@entity160 gave me advice on my novel			0
@entity163 taught me about animal cruelty			0
science writer @entity165 got me interested in what i do today			0
i got useful sex advice from dr. @entity168			0
the experiences we had at @entity2 do change our lives			1
they inspire inside jokes among friends and lovers that seem annoying or absurd to anyone else and make us think that we will always maintain some connection			0
the school inspires a longing to return to that beautiful time when we were surrounded by thousands of people our age who also loved to learn			0
about 20,000 alumni come back to @entity2 for @entity188 every year , a testament to the memories of " @entity190			1
" @entity2 is also notorious for breeding life partnerships			1
pick up any copy of the @entity194 magazine and you 'll see the latest wave of marriage announcements			0
love that happens in college can be incredibly powerful , solidified by uninterrupted time spent together and shared academic and social bliss			2
but it 's not everything			2
i met my college sweetheart after my junior year , when i had been taking five classes per semester , running two campus magazines , writing for other publications and tutoring a second - grader			2
i literally planned every hour of every weekday except six hours of sleep			0
he was two years younger -- scandalous ! -- and he respected me for all of my efforts			0
he even recognized my name from @entity215			0
i 'd like to let you all in on a little secret : if you are following your intellectual passions , that itself makes you attractive			0
but do n't do it to meet other people			0
if i had married my college sweetheart , i would have dragged him to @entity22 , a city without the think tanks and rigorous public policy programs where he would thrive			2
or i would have moved somewhere for him , and given these uncertain times in journalism , it is unclear whether i would have stayed in the field i love			0
inside the @entity2 bubble , this may seem improbable , but you can find fascinating people who did not go to @entity2 or any schools atop the @entity238 rankings			1
i know smart , funny people without four - year degrees			0
i have wonderful friends with great careers with degrees from non-elite schools			0
in fact , i have been dating one of these amazing people for five years -- longer than a @entity2 education			1
disregarding the language in @entity54 's letter that 's offensive to some , it 's really not revolutionary			1
of course , many people want to find their life partner in college			1
i 'm going to go out on a limb here and say : it 's ok to want to find your life partner in college			1
you 're also going to be ok if you do n't find your life partner there			1
a true life partner is going to admire you for following your own intellectual or career passions anyway , so do n't change yourself for someone else			1
potential life partners are findable -- even ones , as @entity54 says , " worthy of you			2
" i still miss my dorm , though , and i 'm totally going to @entity188			0
@entity270 is on @entity271 at @ lizlandau			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity270 .			0

@entity2 alumna says it 's ok to look for life partner in college
differing career paths , distance can *complicate* relationships that started in college
@entity25 's letter to the @entity23 has been *controversial*
