@entity1 's saber rattling again shook the world wednesday			1
@entity3 vowed to shut down a key military hotline with @entity5			0
it was another day of hostile , over-the - top rhetoric from the reclusive , impoverished nation led by @entity9			1
but the recent missile and nuclear tests , and the annulment of the 1953 @entity14 armistice are raising questions about the young leader			2
is his behavior erratic or staged ? is he competent enough to run a government ? @entity3 watchers , reading the news and the tea leaves , say the latest hot air wafting over the @entity24 could reflect an effort to prop up appeal and allegiance for @entity9			2
is the warlike rhetoric for the folks on the home front ? @entity31 , a career @entity32 diplomat , said the " prolonged , rather intense " flurry of tough talk out of @entity3 should n't be ignored , but it could be directed to the citizenry itself			2
" i think there 's a big element of domestic @entity1 politics , if one can understand that concept , where clearly @entity9 is not being well received , " @entity31 told @entity38			1
" i think they are trying to kind of boost his status to some sort of wartime leader			1
" is this about @entity9 trying to consolidate power ? the @entity51 - based independent newspaper said @entity9 is working " to shore up his position			0
" " not only must the new ' supreme leader ' see off challengers from within @entity1 's perhaps skeptical military ; he must also prove to his brutalized , often starving , people that threats from ' foreign imperialists ' must take precedence over , say , early promises of improved living conditions			1
" what better than to conduct a nuclear test , and then use the resulting slap on the wrist from the international community as an excuse to ready the troops , tear up the non-aggression pact with @entity70 and release incendiary propaganda about , for example , @entity72 perishing in a nuclear onslaught ? " is @entity9 mentally stable ? is @entity9 insane ? @entity75 and @entity76 , writing in @entity78 , say " do n't bet on it			0
" they say he 's a contrast to his introverted dad , @entity82			2
in power for more than a year , @entity9 is very much an extrovert who loves to appear in public , watch his beloved hoops and deliver speeches			0
" much of his behavior may be political theater aimed at convincing his own people that the young general is comfortably in charge , but it is also a contrast with his father 's ruling style , " the authors say			1
" @entity82 paid no attention to the public aspect of ruling , whereas his son 's visibility and embrace of popular culture appears to be aimed at convincing @entity1 that changes may actually occur under him			1
" is @entity9 more dangerous than his father ? this month , a senior administration official told @entity38 that @entity9 was " acting in ways a bit more extreme than his father , who was colder and more calculated			0
" " i do n't recall he ever went this far in terms of the pace and scope of the rhetoric			2
threatening to launch nukes directly against the @entity32 and @entity5 confirms what a lot of people have been saying , which is we are dealing with someone new , " the official added			0
another senior administration official said @entity9 's youth and education abroad offered promise for many @entity1 watchers that he would be more willing to engage with the @entity129			1
" unfortunately , he is following the example of his father and grandfather pretty closely , " the official said			0
" it 's hard to be optimistic			2
" his grandfather , @entity135 , was the founding leader of @entity1			1
where will he go beyond political theater ? @entity75 and @entity76 said the question that should be asked about @entity9 is whether he is turning out to be adventurous or cautious			1
a risk - taking leader " may or may not be good for @entity1 and its relations with the outside world , " they say			1
any major changes in foreign policy would bring " enormous hazards			0
" domestic , economic and social reforms also involve risks , they said			0
" if @entity9 moves beyond the political theater of the past 60 years -- chest - thumping , name - calling , threatening to turn @entity70 into a ' sea of fire ' -- and actually risks a major military strike against @entity5 or even the @entity32 , he is putting his own neck , as well as his country 's , on the line , " they wrote			1
what if @entity9 plays it safe ? " a cautious @entity9 , who simply pursues the status quo , would mean that @entity1 policy will muddle along , with no real change to the frustrating , dangerous , decades - long game of brinksmanship , " they said			1
what we do n't know about @entity9 @entity170 , writing in @entity172 , said @entity82 was schooled to take the reins of power			0
@entity9 , however , " is still an unknown quantity			1
" @entity9 " had no political or military experience before taking putative control of the army , the party , and the nation			2
" the young leader " had little time to learn anything ; his behavior is at best hard to read , and at times bewildering			2
" @entity186 cites an incident last year			0
president @entity72 agreed to provide @entity1 with food aid if they suspended missile and nuclear tests			1
but @entity9 embarked on a missile test before the food arrived			0
he touted the act after @entity72 canceled the food aid and got the @entity195 to condemn the @entity1 action			1
he compares @entity9 to his father and grandfather			0
@entity82 and @entity135 " would make a threat , and wait for the enemy ( the @entity32 , @entity5 , the @entity195 , or some combination of the above ) to offer a bribe in exchange for their forbearance			0
they would take the bribe -- and they 'd forbear , " @entity186 writes			0
" but this new @entity9 took the promise of a bribe -- then went ahead and carried out the threat anyway , even before the payment , in this case desperately needed food , came through			0
what the hell ? " people now want to know @entity9 " knows how to play his family 's game , " @entity186 said			0
" it 's always been an odious game , but in the old days , when the father and grandfather were around , it would end with peace , at least for a while , if the west played along , " he said			0

is the rhetoric meant to boost the @entity1 leader 's appeal ?
he *thrives* on political theater
will he be adventurous or cautious ?
he 's still an " unknown quantity "
