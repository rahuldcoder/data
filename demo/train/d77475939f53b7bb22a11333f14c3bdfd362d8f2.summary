-- as media outlets monday circulated security - camera video of @entity4 punching his then - fiancee in a hotel elevator , many wondered why the woman -- now his wife -- would remain with the fallen @entity9 star			1
the answers came in a rush , on @entity12			0
by tuesday the social media platform was flooded with affecting stories from women explaining why they remained in abusive relationships and why they finally left			1
the outpouring was collected under two hashtags , # @entity19 and # @entity20			1
writer and domestic abuse survivor @entity21 said she started the campaign # whyistayed on monday because she wanted to " change the tone of the conversation			1
" @entity21 said she married her husband after he hit her because she loved him -- and , she wanted to " protect " him			0
" i was thinking about him and not myself , and i think that 's the story of a lot of people out there , " she said			1
" the hashtag shows that there are people out there who have lived this , and like me , have come out of this			0
" by tuesday afternoon , the hashtag had been used more than 46,000 times , according to web analytics tool @entity39 , captivating participants and observers alike			0

why i stayed : my domestic abuse story the couple went forward with their plans to marry			1
@entity4 underwent pretrial diversion instead of facing criminal charges , and the @entity9 suspended him for two games -- a punishment criticized by many as too lenient			1
but the incident returned to the the spotlight monday with the release of the elevator video			2
amid the public outcry , people began asking questions about @entity74 's motivations			1
why did n't she leave ? why did she marry him ? why did she stay ? @entity74 posted a statement on @entity78 on tuesday defending her husband and criticizing the media and the public for making her family " relive a moment in our lives that we regret everyday			2
" and on @entity12 , the stories reflected many of the reasons domestic violence victims stay in abusive relationships			1
eventually , people began sharing why they left , in an evolution that added dimension to the conversation , feminist and media critic @entity97 said			2
hashtag campaigns often focus on " raising awareness " without providing solutions or activist strategies , @entity97 said			0
when it comes to helping women in abusive relationships , we need to understand why they stay in the first place , " instead of contributing to the stigma of staying by shaking our heads and asking why , " she said			1
if a woman knows that her actions will be picked apart " she has little incentive to rock the boat and make a change , " @entity97 said			0
" the power of this hashtag is that abuse survivors volunteered the answer to the ' why did she stay ? ' question so that , hopefully , friends and family members of other survivors wo n't have to ask they can just provide support			2
" the reasons women stay in abusive relationships are " complex and varied , " said @entity127 of @entity128 , a @entity129 women 's shelter			1
" too many people assume that if a woman is in an abusive relationship that she is making a choice to stay , and that she has the power to end the abuse if she just leaves , " she said			1
" we need to begin to understand , support and believe victims -- not blame them			0
" instead of asking why does n't she just leave , we should be asking different questions when we read those headlines			2
we should be asking , ' why is he abusive ? ' or ' how can we break the cycle of violence ? ' or ' how can i support her to be safe ? ' " fear is one reason partners stay , especially if children are involved , said @entity149 , chief executive officer of the @entity150			1
@entity151 , who is not connected with the @entity4 incident , offered some general thoughts on what motivates victims of domestic violence when it comes to staying in the relationship or leaving			1
" the fear a woman feels is real			0
the threats her partner makes are real			0
when a woman 's husband tells her he will kill her if she leaves , she believes that			2
we all know it is possible , we see the stories on tv and the @entity170 , " she said			2
in most domestic violence situations , the abusive partner blames the victim and the victim believes it , @entity151 said			1
" outside the home , this man appears to be a great man			0
many woman describe it as @entity182 / mr. @entity182 : ' great guy to everyone else , so i must be the problem , ' " she said			0
@entity4 's fame could have affected his wife 's decision - making , @entity151 said			1
" i ca n't imagine how @entity74 may have felt			0
fans were blaming her on social media , sportscasters made comments somehow indicating she must have provoked the violence , and then she has to sit next to her abuser and apologize , " @entity151 said , referring to a press conference earlier this year			2
" we would never ask a person who was mugged on the street to apologize for walking down the street where their assailant was			0
" love and hope also can play into the dynamic , she said			0
the abusive partner is not abusive all the time , and the victim sees the person with whom she fell in love			2
" victims remember how it used to be and they see that person throughout the relationship			0
the abusive partner continues to tell them that they will change , that the abuse will not happen again , " she said			0
" everyone deserves a relationship that is based on dignity and respect			0
we want victims to be able to reach out and talk to an advocate so they know they have choices			0
