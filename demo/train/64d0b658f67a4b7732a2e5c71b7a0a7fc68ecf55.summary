-- in the late 1950s , a young singer called @entity2 began going by the name of @entity2 , a handle bestowed in part by @entity7 's wife ( seriously ! )			1
because it was a less vulgar time , nobody thought to warn young @entity2 that his new moniker was just begging to be used as a lame double entendre ( example : " @entity2 ? i barely know ' er ! " )			1
but 60 - odd years later , times have most definitely changed			2
celebrities show off their female breast nipples all willy - nilly , despite strict orders from the suits at @entity18			0
nobody really gives a fâ € ” when somebody drops an f - bomb on national tv during the year 's most - watched program			0
and not too long ago , some jokester thought it 'd be funny to make an app called " the @entity2 , " which promises to predict the size of a man 's @entity27 based on what size shoe he wears			1
@entity0 : @entity30 saves @entity31 from huskster naturally , @entity2 was n't pleased when he found out about the app 's existence â € ” and now he 's filing a $ 500,000,000 trademark infringement lawsuit against @entity35 due to the " irreparable damage and harm " caused by this goofy little novelty			1
@entity0 : ' jeopardy ' goes all out with ' @entity40 ' clues the twist : the app was removed from all @entity44 and @entity35 - hosted web sites in september 2012 , and the operating system that runs it was discontinued even before then in august 2011			2
so @entity2 is asking for half a billion dollars on account of something that cost $ .99 , was downloaded a grand total of 84 times , and would have faded away quietly and completely if not for this headline - grabbing lawsuit			2
bad move , @entity52 ; you 'll never get kinged if this is the way you play			0
