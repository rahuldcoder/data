in 2012 , photographer @entity0 sold everything in her @entity3 apartment and hit the road on a cross-country journey			1
her goal ? to photograph individuals from each of the 562 federally recognized @entity10 tribes in the @entity11 and memorialize their stories			1
since then , the number of federally recognized tribes has risen to 566 , and @entity15 is still crisscrossing the country , immersing herself in the worlds of @entity19 from @entity20 to the far reaches of @entity22 for her ongoing photo series , @entity24			1
" stereotypes in the media reduce @entity19 country to the @entity33 in a headdress , " said scholar @entity25 , a member of the @entity26 of @entity27 whom @entity15 photographed for the series			1
" ( project 562 ) gives people an opportunity to see the diversity in @entity19 country and reframe what they think of when they think of @entity19			1
" a selection of photos from @entity24 is on display at the @entity44 in @entity45 through october 5 , with audio from @entity15 's conversations with her subjects			1
fans of the series say its timing could not be better			2
with mainstream @entity54 showing more support for efforts to end appropriation of @entity10 imagery in sports and fashion , they say @entity24 provides positive examples to fill the void			1
" having these counter-narratives and counter-representations to the stereotypes and negative portrayals we see in the media every day is really important for helping people understand contemporary @entity19 , " said @entity25			0
the project is also building relationships in @entity19 country , cultivating bonds among @entity15 , the participants and also connecting them to elite institutions like the @entity44 , @entity25 said			1
" what she 's doing is not just photographing			0
she 's building relationships and bonds that are going to last far beyond the physical photographs			0
" @entity10 designers fight cultural caricatures ' the project is for the people ' @entity15 , whose first name means " the messenger , " said the images allow @entity19 to see a diverse representation of a group they rarely see and hear from			1
they also highlight positive role models in @entity19 country for the next generation			2
" the project is for the people , not just native people but everyone , " @entity15 said			1
" i think that there are truths that remain untold and we can really learn a lot from one another			0
hopefully it can inspire the next generation to seek that authenticity			0
" questions around native american identity are central to @entity24			1
@entity15 asks each person 15 questions about their family history , self - determination , sovereignty and the future			1
then she asks her subjects how and where they would like to be photographed and takes their portrait			0
some wear traditional regalia and pose in sites relevant to their tribe 's history			0
others stand on their porches in t - shirts and jeans , or on the roofs of buildings			0
letting them decide is central to the project , @entity15 said			1
participating in @entity24 was an opportunity for @entity25 to reflect on what being a " contemporary @entity10 " meant to her			2
@entity15 and @entity25 knew each other before @entity24 through their efforts in a larger movement in @entity19 country to change negative perceptions of @entity19			1
@entity25 , a @entity133 - educated post-doctoral researcher at @entity134 focusing on @entity136 access to higher education , deconstructs stereotypes of @entity19 on her blog , @entity140			0
like @entity25 , @entity15 left @entity19 country to pursue higher education and spent part of her career in fashion photography before turning her camera on indigenous communities in @entity54 and the @entity11			1
taking @entity10 fashion ' beyond @entity148 ' the two met in @entity25 's apartment in downtown @entity151 in january , when @entity25 was writing her dissertation as a predoctoral fellow at @entity154			2
@entity25 told @entity15 about how her @entity26 ancestors were forced from their ancestral lands in western @entity157 to @entity27			2
they lived in @entity27 until they were displaced by the construction of a river			0
it was not until @entity25 was working on her dissertation at @entity133 that she visited her ancestral land in @entity157 for the first time			0
she said it was a powerful experience she 'll never forget			0
" we talked about how to me , being a real @entity167 means i can go to those places and feel a connection with the land and know my ancestors stood there thousands of years ago , " she said			0
" this is something that runs through me , and that connection makes me a real @entity26 person , being able to say that with full authority and full knowledge			0
i had n't felt it until i was there			0
" creating a legacy for @entity136 youth the concept of identity is fluid from person to person and generation to generation , @entity15 said			1
some @entity19 lost their language and traditions through assimilation in @entity19 boarding schools			0
others are fighting for federal recognition of their tribes under the vast regulatory criteria of the @entity11 @entity197 's @entity196			0
the project has prompted her to ponder what being a @entity10 will mean for future generations			1
code talker @entity202 and the tragic history of native language " i 've recently come to recognize that it really is about the actions , the way we choose to live our lives on a daily basis , is ( what 's ) really going to control the outcome of what happens to our people , " @entity15 explained			1
she has high hopes for @entity218 's legacy			2
this year , a second @entity220 campaign surpassed her $ 54,000 goal , to raise more than $ 213,000			0
she 's using the money to continue traveling and plan the next iteration of @entity24 as books , websites , maybe even educational materials			2
" the life we live is for the people , " @entity15 said			2
" that 's what i was raised for , to find my gift and share it with the community			2

@entity0 began *touring* the country in 2012 to photograph native americans
those images , project 562 , show the diversity of @entity10 identity
project 562 is on display at the @entity44 until october 2014
@entity15 hopes to turn the images into books and websites that share native culture
