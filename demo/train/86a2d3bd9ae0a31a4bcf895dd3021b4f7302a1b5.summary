@entity0 -- the @entity2 and the @entity3 are n't going to have all of the fun this election year			2
governors are sure to get a slice of the pie with 36 races on tap			1
while not as high - profile as many congressional races , gubernatorial campaigns are statewide races and can reveal political and policy trends that play out nationally			1
governors often drive legislative agendas in their states and many possess broad authority to act unilaterally on policy and other matters that can impact millions of people			1
states enacted around 40,000 laws last year on issues that ranged from same - sex marriage to the use of teen tanning beds			1
5 @entity2 races to watch in 2014 governors have final say on funding for middle school computers as well as public safety programs			1
they can reject or approve new voter id laws and limits on abortion			2
additionally , the @entity2 is often a spring board to the @entity39			0
many presidents -- including four of the past six -- were governors first			1
here are five gubernatorial races to watch in 2014 : @entity43 gov. @entity44 is retiring , opening the door for a newcomer			1
while @entity43 is a solidly @entity48 state , the liberal left is heavily involved as they see a winner in candidate @entity51			1
a state senator , @entity52 rose to prominence last june when she filibustered a bill that would make it much more difficult for @entity43 women to obtain an abortion			1
the left got behind her and helped propel her candidacy for governor			0
@entity61 of the non-partisan @entity61 wrote that @entity52 faces an uphill battle with the still - to - be - determined @entity48 candidate holding an advantage in the reliably red state			1
still , @entity66 , he said , have incentive to push for her victory			0
" democrats and liberals believe that long - term demographic trends will turn @entity43 purple , and @entity52 ' effort could speed up that process , they hope			1
moreover , she could well be a national fundraising machine for liberal groups , no matter how realistic her prospects , " he wrote			0
@entity81 the @entity81 is a perennial battleground in presidential races , so anyone leading it factors into the bigger conversation			1
this year , gov. @entity86 is asking voters for a second chance			0
elected in 2010 with the support of the tea party , the former congressman initially championed conservative agenda that included dramatic cuts to state pensions			1
but he ran into trouble with fellow @entity48 during the 2012 presidential election when he touted @entity81 's vastly improved economy during his time in office , a talking point that did not mesh with @entity48 presidential candidate @entity101			1
his campaign focused heavily on @entity104 economic difficulties			0
mostly ignored , shifts emerge in the politics of poverty and as in any battleground state , the party not in power often has a shot			1
polls show @entity86 and the leading @entity66 contender , @entity114 , in a close matchup			0
a tough general election fight , however , is not in the cards yet			0
@entity86 must first win a primary sought by conservatives disappointed with @entity86 's decision to expand @entity121 for the poor			0
the funding for that comes from federal money made available as part of president @entity128 's health care reforms that are detested by most republicans and a centerpiece of their campaign overall to defeat @entity66 in november			1
@entity86 's @entity48 challenger : tea party leader @entity132			0
@entity134 the primary will be the first real test for the governor 's race in one of the most populous and politically important states			1
former @entity141 gov. @entity141 is now @entity66 gubernatorial candidate @entity141			2
@entity141 has a long political history in the @entity134			1
instead of running for re-election in 2010 , he aimed for the @entity3			0
but he was bested in the @entity48 primary by tea party favorite @entity145 , which led @entity141 to change his affiliation to @entity149			0
he still lost that election			0
now he 's trying again for the post he once held			0
if he wins his primary against state sen. @entity153 , he 'll face @entity48 incumbent @entity154 , whose tenure has been tenuous			2
a recent @entity158 and @entity157 poll in the vote - rich @entity159 found that 44 % of respondents said @entity154 is doing a " not so good " or " poor " job			2
the non-partisan @entity61 rates this race as a tossup and likely to be extremely expensive			0
a competitive statewide fight will be very closely noted by 2016 @entity39 contenders -- who may include @entity145 -- to detect campaign and voter trends in what 's been a presidential battleground in the past			2
@entity171 @entity48 incumbent @entity172 is running for re-election -- again			0
this will be his third election in four years			0
he was forced into a recall election in 2012 after @entity66 successfully forced a vote in response to severe cuts in state pensions as a budget - cutting measure			1
@entity172 won his recall bid with 53 % of the vote , 1 % more than his 2010 election			0
while @entity186 rates this race as a likely win for @entity172 , democrats are rallying behind @entity189 , a member of the @entity191 school board and former trek bike executive			1
this race is also notable because @entity172 could be making a play for a possible 2016 presidential run			2
@entity196 @entity66 do n't hold that many gubernatorial seats , so keeping this one in @entity66 hands is critical			2
it is a reliably @entity66 state and home to the president , so a loss would be especially difficult for a party that has lost ground in state legislatures in recent years			2
whether they like it or not , @entity66 have incumbent @entity207 as their candidate			0
the race is considered a tossup by @entity186 even though @entity48 do n't yet have a strong candidate			0
@entity207 has angered and pleased @entity66 in the past month alone			0
he signed a bill that cut state pensions , angering unions , and approved a measure legalizing same - sex marriage , pleasing social liberals			1
the @entity219 wrote that his actions could benefit him politically			0
if so , that 's a stark shift from the just a couple months earlier when he tangled with the @entity66 - controlled @entity224			2
the @entity61 wrote during @entity207 's tumultuous fall , " @entity66 ' saving grace could be the ineptness of the state @entity48			2
" 5 @entity3 races to watch in 2014			1

there are 36 gubernatorial races on tap in 2014
twenty - nine republicans are governors , giving them an edge over democrats
being a state chief executive is often a *springboard* for higher office
@entity134 and @entity81 offer *key* races and are presidential battlegrounds
