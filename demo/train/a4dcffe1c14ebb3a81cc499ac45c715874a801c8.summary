-- @entity2 midfielder @entity1 scored the winning goal as @entity5 's @entity4 defeated former club @entity6 2 - 1 in the first leg of their @entity8 last 16 tie at the @entity10			1
@entity1 drilled home a low shot from 18 yards out , just four minutes after @entity6 had levelled matters , to leave the tie finely poised ahead of the second leg at @entity16 in three weeks			1
all the talk beforehand had been about the two coaches , @entity5 and @entity19 -- with no love lost between the pair from when @entity19 was in charge of @entity4 's rivals @entity23 , who share the @entity10 with them			1
added to the mix was the fact that @entity5 was still highly - thought of by many at @entity6 after leading the club to successive league titles in 2005 and 2006			2
and it was @entity5 's side who struck first , taking a third minute lead when @entity34 cut inside @entity35 before firing home a shot inside goalkeeper @entity39 's right - hand post			0
in a frantic opening 45 minutes , @entity40 struck the bar for @entity6 with a fierce free - kick while they also had a penalty claim for a tackle on @entity46 turned down			2
however , @entity6 did equalize six minute after the re-start			0
fine work from right - back @entity49 saw him skip a couple of challenges before laying the ball off to @entity46 , who curled home a shot fromt he edge of the area that goalkeeper @entity58 should have done better with			0
but @entity1 quickly restored @entity4 's advantage and @entity58 then made up for his error on the goal by keeping out @entity63 's close - range strike			1
@entity6 may have to do without keeper @entity39 for the second leg			2
the @entity65 international appeared to damage his knee while rolling the ball out and had to be stretchered off			0
his possible absence would be a major blow for the @entity73 side as they fight for trophies on three fronts this season			0
meanwhile , in the evening 's other @entity8 tie , @entity79 side @entity78 look favorites to progress after earning a 1 - 1 draw at @entity83			1
@entity84 gave the @entity86 side a 25th minute lead when tapping home at the far post from a pinpoint @entity91 cross			0
but the home side levelled midway through the second half when @entity94 , who ironically joined @entity83 in the summer from @entity78 's city rivals @entity96 , fired home an unstoppable long - range drive that gave goalkeeper @entity99 no chance .			1

@entity1 scores the winner as @entity4 defeat @entity6 2 - 1
the result leaves @entity8 last 16 tie evenly poised ahead of second leg
@entity83 *recover* to draw 1 - 1 with @entity78 in the evening 's other tie
