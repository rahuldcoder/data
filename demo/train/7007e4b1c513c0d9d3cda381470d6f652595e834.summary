@entity0 -- walk into rep. @entity4 's @entity3 office , and you are overwhelmed with how much the @entity7 @entity6 is consumed by the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
there are photos on the walls of funerals he attended , images of a smoky @entity15 , and baseball caps with sayings including " @entity18 , @entity19			2
" @entity4 says he does n't have a monopoly on grief -- but it is what drives him			1
" if you ask me what i think about going to work every day , it 's 9/11 and preventing another 9/11			2
there were too many people i knew , " he told @entity1 in an interview in his office			2
that 's why he says he is determined to use his powerful post as @entity34 chairman to hold a series of highly controversial hearings on what he has dubbed radicalization of @entity40 in the @entity41			1
" i have no choice , i have to hold these hearings , these hearings are absolutely essential , " @entity4 said before the first hearing in march			1
" there are elements in that community that are being radicalized , and i believe that the leadership , the leaders of that community , do not face up to that reality			2
too many cases are not cooperative , not willing to speak out and condemn this type of radicalization that is going on , " he insisted			2
the fact that he is singling out the @entity58 community has ignited protests and anger against him , and accusations of bigotry			2
he has even been compared to sen. @entity63 , who used a congressional gavel he wielded in the 1950s to go on a @entity67 witch hunt			0
@entity4 said there is " no basis " for that			1
" i tell people wait and watch and listen to the hearing and they will see it will be a thoughtful , meaningful , very fair hearing , " he said			0
@entity4 once had a close bond with leaders in the @entity58 community			1
in the 1990s , he broke with fellow @entity6 and backed president @entity77 's military efforts in the @entity78 to defend @entity40 there			1
" that was not popular in my district , but i did it because it was the right thing to do			0
i thought the @entity84 populations in those countries were being victimized , " said @entity4			1
though the @entity84 community in his mostly blue - collar @entity88 district is small , @entity4 had close relationships with @entity84 leaders -- he even attended a ribbon - cutting at a local mosque			1
but @entity4 said after 9/11 a switch flipped			1
" i saw the @entity58 community not responding the way that they should have , covering up for @entity96 , when they tried to blame it on @entity98 or the @entity99 -- i could n't believe what i was hearing			0
these people -- i had known them for years , i had their relatives interning in my office , i had gone to weddings and dinners of leaders in the @entity84 - @entity41 community -- and the same people that i had known , i hear them saying its not @entity96 , it 's the @entity99			1
i could n't believe it , " recalled @entity4			1
one of those leaders was @entity114 with the @entity115 of @entity88			0
" i said we should also investigate the possibility of @entity118 being involved			0
that changed his opinion 100 % , " said @entity114			0
@entity4 said he was furious that no @entity84 leaders denounced those post- 9/11 comments			1
but even worse , he insisted , was what he started hearing from law enforcement -- that the @entity84 - @entity41 community was not cooperating with efforts to rein in radicalization and prevent terror threats			1
" that would be psychobabble , to say that because of what was said after 9/11 , i 'm holding these hearings			1
that 's when i first began to look more carefully , " he said			0
" since then , it 's dealing with police at all levels , in @entity7 and around the country			0
... privately , i am told time and again that they 're not getting the cooperation they need			0
@entity4 , the son of a @entity7 police academy instructor and a self - described close friend of @entity7 cops and firefighters , insists he gets the real story from his buddies about what they call lack of cooperation in the @entity84 community in rooting out radicalism			1
but other law enforcement officials say they get valuable assistance from @entity84 - @entity41			1
and academic studies , like one conducted by @entity156 and the @entity157 , show fellow @entity41 @entity40 turned in 48 of the @entity40 suspected of plotting terror attacks on the @entity41 since 9/11			1
@entity4 insists that does n't jibe with what he hears on the ground			1
" i can tell you that in @entity7 , we 're in the epicenter , we 're in the eye of the storm			0
there has been no virtually no real cooperation coming from the @entity58 community			0
the police commissioner 's office in ( @entity171 ) has said that they have not gotten one tip from the @entity58 community , " he said			0
still , @entity4 invited no law enforcement officials to be witnesses at the march hearing -- neither the @entity99 director , nor the attorney general , nor any of the @entity7 officials who he says tell him they 're concerned			1
the only one who attended was @entity181 sheriff @entity180 because he was invited by @entity182 on the panel			0
some call @entity4 's efforts against @entity41 @entity84 terrorism hypocritical			1
in the 1980s , @entity4 , an @entity186 , was an active supporter of @entity187 and the @entity188 , an organization the @entity190 then deemed terrorists , which was responsible for hundreds of civilian deaths in terror attacks			1
" i knew what was happening in @entity196 , and with the @entity188			0
the @entity188 was a legitimate force , they 'd been there for 40 years , 60 years , any way you want to look at it , " said @entity4			1
he insists he only got involved so heavily with @entity187 because he knew he would be willing to broker peace with the @entity204 government			0
" i was one of those helped bring ( peace ) about			0
this is n't me saying it , it 's @entity209 and @entity77 saying that , among others , " said @entity4 , who later pointed to a photo on his wall of @entity209 , the former @entity204 prime minister , with an inscription praising @entity4 for his role in the @entity215			2
the @entity217 editorialized before the march hearing that @entity4 is a man " obsessed " with @entity84 radicalism			2
is he obsessed ? " i 'm very focused , " he replied			0
" i lost many people from my ( congressional ) district on 9/11 , and within a 30 - mile radius of my home , probably about a thousand people murdered on 9/11			0
" another answer to that question may be in what @entity4 writes about			2
he is a part - time novelist , and in 2004 published a book called " @entity230 , " about an @entity186 - @entity41 congressman from @entity7 who traces a terrorist attack to @entity84 radicals in his own district			2
" you write about what you know , " shrugged @entity4			2
if the negative publicity and protests about his hearing are getting to @entity4 , he 's hiding it well			2
" hey , i would love to be loved , you know , i 'm not a masochist			0
but on the other hand , i have a job to do			0
and i would not want to wake up the day after an attack and say , ' i should 've done something differently , ' " he said			0
" my goal , if i could have an ultimate goal , is to have new leaders emerge from within the @entity252 , who are not defensive , who day in , day out , are willing to denounce radicalizations , denounce the attempts by @entity96 to go into their communities			0
" @entity1 's @entity258 contributed to this report .			0
