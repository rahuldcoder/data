@entity0 -- after generations of conflict , the clamor of the @entity5 - @entity4 dispute has the tendency to drown out other voices and stories from the region			0
the work of multimedia artist @entity13 -- whose identity as a @entity4 @entity16 living in @entity5 makes him " a minority within a minority " -- aims to rectify this			1
through the use of video , historical photographs and documents , the @entity20 - based @entity13 tells the narrative of a marginalized community			1
" it 's not about supporting one cause or another , " he says			0
" it 's about having this voice heard among other voices			0
" @entity13 , whose first solo show in the @entity34 , " 40 days , " opens in @entity0 's @entity36 gallery on april 12 , focuses on depicting the experiences of the @entity39 's @entity16 minorities , including his own family			1
while his father is of @entity45 - @entity44 descent , @entity13 's mother is a @entity16 , her family hailing from @entity47 , known in @entity48 as @entity49 , ancient city 15 kilometers ( 9 miles ) southeast of @entity51			1
the city is home to the @entity53 , a major shrine to the 4th - century @entity16 martyr			1
" the cemetery is where my grandfather is buried , my great - grandfather , for many generations back , " @entity13 says			1
" it can be under @entity5 , @entity61 , @entity34 regime ; we have zero control over it , being a weak and small minority -- weak in numbers , not in education			0
but we have a connection to the place itself			0
" read more : a great year for @entity39 cinema when the territory was claimed by the newly declared state of @entity5 in 1948 , the @entity71 were expelled , with only about 1,050 remaining			1
some of @entity13 's family resettled in @entity0 , @entity76 and @entity77 , but others remained , finding themselves in an " extremely complicated and difficult " situation , he says			1
" we have pressure from both groups -- the @entity83 and the @entity5 -- to identify with their goals , " he says			0
" i think that in the case of the @entity16 , we really got stuck in between sometimes			1
" @entity13 says the community had to negotiate their identity against two majority groups -- @entity5 @entity45 and @entity71 -- displaying a dual attitude towards both groups to protect their identity			1
on the one hand , he says , they demonstrated their will to integrate , but they also had a clear desire to maintain a distinct cultural identity			2
" both @entity45 society and @entity97 society fail to understand the versatility of the @entity16 minority , as well as its religious , social and cultural needs , " he says			1
today , the majority of @entity4 christians live outside @entity5 and the @entity16 territories			2
according to @entity5 's @entity105 , there are about 120,000 @entity106 in @entity5			0
@entity13 's art draws heavily on the @entity108 , an electronic database he started that catalogs photographs , passports , birth certificates and other documents from the community 's history			1
it started out as a family archive but quickly snowballed to include members of the @entity4 @entity16 diaspora throughout the world , he says			2
" i started thinking , ' why do n't we as a community have our own archive , when almost every culture around the world has one ? ' " he says			2
" obviously , it 's because of political reasons			0
a lot of @entity102 around the @entity39 do n't want to build an archive because it will be interpreted as a political act of separation			0
" read more : @entity76 's love for the arts @entity134 , secretary of the board of trustees behind the @entity36 , said @entity13 's personal background informed his work			1
" he is the product of two conflicting realities -- the creation of the state of @entity5 which made it possible for his father 's @entity45 @entity44 family to immigrate to @entity5 and the dispossession of his mother 's family , " he says			0
@entity13 's focus on the fate of the region 's minorities was particularly poignant " in a time of great sectarian tension -- in @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 and quite possibly elsewhere , " @entity134 says			2
@entity13 says his work had provoked strong reactions in @entity5			1
" some of them are very supportive , but a lot of them are like , ' you 're a traitor -- why should a museum in @entity5 show the narrative of @entity16 ? ' " he says			2
" i think that 's a part of the dialogue with audience			0
i would have been surprised if it was received quietly -- not that i think of what i do as something provocative			0
" rather , he says , his work is about asking " what is nationality " and " creating a community through individual voices			2
" " i think that what unifies people is a will , " he says , adding that there are " many different voices within what we call @entity179			0
i think that 's something that 's very important to remember			0

@entity13 is an artist who has *dedicated* himself to telling the story of @entity16 communities
he has *launched* a @entity189 which he draws on heavily for his work
he says the community negotiates its identity against @entity193 and @entity71
