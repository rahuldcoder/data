-- @entity1 may be struck by lightning every day , but it 's nothing to do with the miserable @entity5 weather			1
deep within the @entity9 university 's department of engineering is a state - of - the - art " lightning - lab " where bolts of electricity are shot onto aircraft components			1
the idea is to recreate the conditions present when lightning strikes a plane at 35,000 feet , testing the fortitude of composite materials and conductor strips found on modern planes			1
" there is a lightning strike every second around the world ( and ) every single aircraft is hit by lightning once a year , " said professor @entity24 of @entity1 's @entity25			0
displaying the charred remains of two recently zapped plane panels , @entity24 explains that a thin layer of copper mesh on an aircraft 's exterior can drastically reduce the damage caused when lightning strikes			1
with support from the government and aerospace manufacturer , @entity40 , the ultimate aim of the $ 2 million project is to further refine and increase the working knowledge of how aircraft cope with these elements at altitude			0
explore more : how airports beat bad weather but while of particular interest to the electrical storm specialists at @entity1 , lightning is just one of the many extreme weather phenomena encountered by planes when in the air			1
the build up of ice and strong winds in particular can also be issues and a host of academic institutions are applying hi - tech techniques to study the impact these conditions can have			2
watch this : superjumbo visits in tiny @entity71 village at @entity74 just outside @entity75 a team of engineers specialize in analyzing the formation of ice around engines and on aeroplane wings			1
here , sub-zero temperatures are created and tests carried out in a specially designed " icing - tunnel " with the aim of understanding ice and its aerodynamic qualities			2
according to dr @entity86 of @entity88 's @entity87 , a large build up of ice can alter the shape and performance of vital aircraft components			2
pointing to a freshly tested model wing , @entity86 explains how " the ice that forms ( during flight ) ... can have a big spike that reverses the curvature of the leading ( wing ) edge and creates unsteadiness			0
" " in an aircraft we work out which parts are most critical and make sure they 're protected one way or another , " he added			0
researchers at @entity88 are currently investigating how a wire mesh can act as an effective method of preventing ice build up near fuel tanks			0
but @entity86 is hopeful that other discoveries on how planes react to extreme weather will arise during the process of the group 's studies			2
" we 're really trying to support the people who design and test aircraft , " @entity86 said			0
" there 's always a little bit of efficiencies that we can build in or maybe we can design slightly more efficiently to get performance for the passengers and for the environment			0
