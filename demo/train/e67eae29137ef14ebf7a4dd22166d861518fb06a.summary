-- after days of mass demonstrations , @entity2 's military finally ousted @entity4 , the country 's first democratically elected president , in the country 's second revolution in two years			1
@entity4 , a @entity9 - educated @entity8 aligned with the @entity11 movement , had rejected an ultimatum delivered by the military to resolve the crisis within 48 hours , creating a stand - off with the military , the most powerful institution in the country			1
in a televised speech to the nation , @entity2 's top military officer , gen. @entity20 @entity19 , said @entity4 " did not achieve the goals of the people " during his single year in office			1
who runs @entity2 now ? @entity19 said @entity27 , head of the country 's @entity28 , would replace @entity4 as interim president and @entity27 was sworn in on thursday			1
the road map announced by @entity19 also includes suspending and rewriting the constitution introduced after former dictator @entity34 's ouster , and holding new parliamentary and presidential elections at a later , unspecified date			2
at his swearing in ceremony , @entity27 said the @entity2 people had given him the authority " to amend and correct " the 2011 revolution			0
who is @entity27 ? the 67 - year - old judge only became the head of @entity2 's @entity28 on monday , and was named as the country 's new interim president just two days later			2
he was appointed vice president of the court in 1992 , serving during @entity34 's nearly 30 - year rule			2
@entity0 's chief international correspondent @entity51 said that , according to one former military official , @entity27 could serve between 9 to 12 months in an interim role			1
profile : @entity27 how have the @entity2 people reacted ? the news has been met with jubilation and fireworks in @entity58 in central @entity59 , where hundreds of thousands had turned out in recent days demanding @entity4 leave office			1
their complaints ranged from concerns about the @entity11 's @entity65 agenda being brought to bear on the nation 's laws , to frustration with his government 's failure to address high unemployment , crime and living costs			0
but @entity4 , who was elected as president with 52 % of the vote last year , retains a substantial support base , which has congregated at rallies in places like @entity80 in @entity59			1
the @entity82 camp has decried the army 's move as an illegitimate coup and refused to accept its validity , while @entity4 himself has declared that he is still president			1
@entity0 senior international correspondent @entity88 , a former @entity59 bureau chief who has been covering the crisis , said one protester at a @entity82 rally had told him he felt demonstrators would stay there " until @entity4 is once again president of @entity2			1
" despite the euphoria in @entity58 , said @entity88 , " there 's a significant portion of the @entity2 population -- i would n't suggest it 's a majority -- who are very upset at what has happened			1
" as news of the coup broke , clashes were reported throughout the country , with at least eight killed and 340 wounded			0
political violence had rocked the country in the days leading up to the military takeover			0
how are @entity4 and the @entity11 being treated ? the deposed president was arrested by presidential guards at their headquarters , and is being held under house arrest and " basically cut ( off ) from the world , " @entity11 spokesman @entity108 told @entity0			2
" they cut all his access , all his calls			0
no one is meeting him , " he said			0
according to reports , the military has also begun rounding up members of the @entity11 , the long - repressed political movement that propelled the deposed president to office			0
state - run newspaper @entity124 reported 300 members of the @entity11 were being sought by police , and @entity108 said the @entity11 's @entity128 chief , @entity129 , and his deputy , @entity130 , had been arrested			0
has anyone else been affected in the crackdown ? arabic satellite network @entity133 reported its @entity59 studios were raided during a live broadcast and its presenter , guests and producers detained , after broadcasting a taped statement from @entity4			2
how is @entity4 's @entity8 base likely to respond ? @entity4 has called for dialogue and appealed to his supporters to demonstrate peacefully , but observers fear the army 's actions could trigger a violent response			1
@entity88 said there was a danger that some members of the @entity11 would become disenfranchised and " challenge ( @entity2 's new leaders ) with violence			1
they may take the attitude of ' we tried to play the game , our leaders were jailed , our media have been shut down ... so we 're going to destroy the system , ' " he said			0
he felt the mood appeared more volatile than after @entity34 's ouster in 2011			0
" there 's not going to be that quiet after the storm this time around , " he said			1
@entity165 , @entity166 professor emeritus of international relations , wrote an opinion piece for @entity0 warning of a potential extremist backlash to the coup			1
" the major lesson that @entity8 in the @entity173 are likely to learn from this episode is that they will not be allowed to exercise power no matter how many compromises they make in both the domestic and foreign policy arenas			0
" he added : " this is likely to push a substantial portion of mainstream islamists into the arms of the extremists who reject democracy and ideological compromise			0
" telling @entity0 's @entity188 that the @entity82 protests would remain on the streets , @entity11 spokesman @entity108 reiterated his movement 's commitment to non-violence , but hinted at the frustrations felt by his camp			0
" at the end of the day , we are committed to democracy and to peaceful change of power			0
but if the road to democracy every time ... gets derailed ... what other option are the people left with ? " what has been the reaction internationally ? @entity206 president @entity205 has expressed his country 's " deep concern " over the toppling of a democratically elected leader and the suspension of the constitution , and said he would instruct officials to review aid contributions to @entity2 as a result			2
but as @entity0 's @entity217 pointed out , @entity205 's statement was telling in that he did not use the word " coup , " and in that he called on the @entity2 military to restore power to " a democratically elected civilian government " -- but not explicitly @entity4 's			1
@entity224 @entity223 ban ki - moon also called for a quick return to civilian rule , appealing for " calm , non-violence , dialogue and restraint			0
" by contrast , @entity231 and the @entity232 both issued statements congratulating the @entity2 military for their actions			0
' correction ' or ' coup ' ? the military 's actions have been decried as a coup by @entity4 supporters but celebrated as a " correction " and an expression of the popular will by his opponents			1
the issue of definition is critical , as @entity51 pointed out , with ramifications in terms of how the international community responds to the situation			2
but , she said , " if it 's proven and true that they 're running around issuing arrest warrants for all these people , attacking and closing down various media outlets , there 's very little you can call it other than a coup			1
" as one analyst said to me ... no matter what it 's called ... it 's umpired by the army ... it 's the army in charge no matter who they put there ( in charge )			2
" the situation was " a paradox , " she added			0
" here you have the first elected government -- which obviously did n't perform as the people wanted -- now being drummed out by the military called upon by so many millions of @entity2			0
