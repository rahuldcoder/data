-- the @entity1 is releasing the details of its new net neutrality order in stages			1
although the @entity1 's new ban on " unreasonable discrimination " for wired @entity11 allows certain kinds of traffic discrimination ( not all bits need be equal ) , the agency made clear after tuesday 's meeting that " paid prioritization " deals with @entity15 companies are unlikely to be allowed			1
critics had worried that the @entity18 would only affect outright website blocking , leaving paid prioritization untouched ( or even implicitly sanctioned )			1
" pay for priority unlikely to satisfy ' no @entity24 , " advises one subheading of the new net neutrality rules			2
@entity26 's dream of directly charging @entity27 and @entity28 to " use his pipes " -- a key event in starting the entire net neutrality debate -- appears to be dashed			0
" a commercial arrangement between a broadband provider and a third party to directly or indirectly favor some traffic over other traffic in the connection to a subscriber of the broadband provider ( i.e. , ' pay for priority ' ) would raise significant cause for concern , " the @entity1 then elaborates			1
this is because " pay for priority would represent a significant departure from historical and current practice			0
" insofar as engaged as we 've reported , the @entity1 's new rules forbid internet providers from blocking lawful content and they require transparency from @entity11			1
they also require that network management and packet discrimination to be " reasonable , " but that only applies to wireline broadband			1
wireless operators gets a free pass on rationality ; they 're limited only to the transparency and blocking provisions			0
here 's the text of the @entity1 's " no unreasonable discrimination " rule : a person engaged in the provision of fixed broadband internet access service , insofar as such person is so engaged , shall not unreasonably discriminate in transmitting lawful network traffic over a consumer 's broadband internet access service			1
reasonable network management shall not constitute unreasonable discrimination			1
what are " reasonable network management " practices ? here you go : a network management practice is reasonable if it is appropriate and tailored to achieving a legitimate network management purpose , taking into account the particular network architecture and technology of the broadband internet access service			1
legitimate network management purposes include : ensuring network security and integrity , including by addressing traffic that is harmful to the network ; addressing traffic that is unwanted by users ( including by premise operators ) , such as by providing services or capabilities consistent with a user 's choices regarding parental controls or security capabilities ; and by reducing or mitigating the effects of congestion on the network			1
" @entity106 services " like @entity107 ( think @entity108 '' s u-verse ) will also be allowed over the last - mile broadband connection , although the @entity1 insists it will watch their deployment for anti-competitive behavior			2
but the order rather strongly suggests that priority deals are " unlikely " to fit into this " reasonable " framework			0
why not ? first , " since the beginning of the @entity15 , " the agency explains , " internet access providers have typically not charged particular content or application providers fees to reach the providers ' consumer retail service subscribers or struck pay - for - priority deals , and the record does not contain evidence that @entity121 broadband providers currently engage in such arrangements			1
" second , priority deals would represent a " departure from longstanding norms " and " could cause great harm to innovation and investment in and on the @entity15			0
" they would raise barriers on entry for edge providers and could also boost " transaction costs arising from the need to reach agreements with one or more broadband providers to access a critical mass of potential users			0
" third , pay for priority could hurt users at the low end of the economic ladder -- bloggers , students , libraries , schools , advocacy groups			0
" even open @entity15 skeptics acknowledge that pay for priority may disadvantage non-commercial uses of the network , which are typically less able to pay for priority , and for which the @entity15 is a uniquely important platform			0
" finally , @entity11 that push pay for priority service " would have an incentive to limit the quality of service provided to non-prioritized traffic			0
" as some game developers worry , @entity11 might effectively charge for non-inferior service , investing " less in open access and more in services that they can provide at a premium			0
" " in light of each of these concerns , as a general matter , it is unlikely that pay for priority would satisfy the ' no unreasonable discrimination ' standard , " this section of the @entity1 's order concludes			1
" the practice of a broadband internet access service provider prioritizing its own content , applications , or services , or those of its affiliates , would raise the same significant concerns and would be subject to the same standards and considerations in evaluating reasonableness as third - party pay - for - priority arrangements			2
" history all of these assertions will soon be contested			0
@entity108 has all but told the @entity1 that it could live with net neutrality rules ... provided those rules give a green light to priority access arrangements			1
as @entity108 warned the @entity1 a year ago , a " strict " nondiscrimination provision " would completely ban voluntary commercial agreements for the paid provision of certain value - added broadband services , which would needlessly deprive market participants , including content providers , from willingly obtaining services that could improve consumers ' internet experiences			1
" on top of that , @entity108 has its own take on the history of this matter			0
the @entity11 insists that paid priority access was " fully " and even " expressly " contemplated by the @entity213 decades ago as it mapped out the ' @entity215 's key protocol , @entity214			2
but the @entity216 pushes back that @entity108 is misreading early @entity213 documents , which were purposed to " describing the technical architecture needed to deploy differential services not the payment schemes that may be associated with it			0
" hello , @entity222 then there 's the sticky question of whether the dispute between @entity222 and @entity226 falls into this zone of scrutiny			0
the internet backbone and @entity231 operator insists that @entity226 crossed the line by charging it to move @entity234 movie data to @entity226 network subscribers			2
@entity226 pushes back that this is just a private peering / transit dispute , in which @entity222 's sudden jump in traffic required a economic response			0
when asked if the @entity1 would scrutinize the @entity222 dispute , chairman @entity240 responded that the agency was " looking into it			2
" it seems likely that if controversies like this keep coming up , complaints invoking the @entity1 's @entity18 will be filed , requiring the @entity1 to look into the matter quite a bit over the coming months			1
@entity226 seems quite sanguine about tuesday 's decision			0
" while we look forward to reviewing the final order , the rules as described generally appear intended to strike a workable balance between the needs of the marketplace for certainty and everyone 's desire that internet openness be preserved , " @entity226 vice president @entity250 declared			1
" most importantly , this approach removes the cloud of @entity264 regulation that would unquestionably have harmed innovation and investment in the @entity15 and broadband infrastructure			0
" reasonable and timely rather than @entity269 common carrier regulations , much of the order 's legal framework is based on @entity272 of the @entity273 , which requires the @entity1 to " encourage the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability to all @entity121			1
" the question of whether this and various other sections of the @entity273 that the @entity1 is invoking will survive court scrutiny is an interesting one , but there are other potential legal bugbears ahead			2
the @entity11 also insist that they 've got the @entity286 right to cut priority access deals with content providers			2
" @entity286 protects the right not just to decide what to say , but how to say it , " former @entity290 ceo @entity289 declared last year			0
" does the @entity286 really allow the government to prohibit a content or applications provider from paying to acquire the means to distribute its content in the form or manner it wishes ? " how will all this play itself out ? it depends on how the @entity1 enforces this advisory , and who sues the government in response			1
" we have a legal basis for the rules we adopted today that is very strong -- that gives us the authority we need , " @entity240 told reporters in a press conference held after tuesday 's @entity310 meeting			2
" and i am confident it will in court			0
