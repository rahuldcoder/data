@entity0 , @entity1 -- bomb attacks by dissidents in @entity7 nearly quadrupled over the past six months from the period before , a report from the @entity4 said thursday			1
dissident republicans have steadily increased the number of improvised explosive devices they have deployed and detonated over the past two and a half years , the commission said			1
since may , the number of devices deployed was roughly double that of the previous six months -- and the number detonated went up nearly fourfold , it said			1
the findings by the commission , set up nearly seven years ago by the @entity19 and @entity20 governments , are in the latest and last of its biannual reports on the paramilitary and security situation in @entity7			1
while the number of bombings has gone up , there have been no deaths from bomb attacks and no one has suffered life - threatening injuries			1
still , the commission said , " the high level of dissident activity would undoubtedly have led to many more deaths , injuries , and destruction had it not been for the operations of the law enforcement and security agencies north and south ( in @entity7 and the @entity20 ) and their ever closer cross-border co-operation			0
" it said that in both @entity7 and the @entity20 , about three times the number of dissidents have been charged with terrorist offenses in all of 2010 than in 2009 , and the number of arrests has nearly doubled			1
dissident republicans are those who refused to accept the 1998 good friday peace settlement and power - sharing deal negotiated and signed by mainstream republican leaders such as @entity52 's @entity51 and @entity53			0
groups like the @entity55 and @entity56 broke away from the @entity57 , also called the @entity57 , which fought for decades against @entity19 rule in @entity7			0
the @entity57 agreed to a process of decommissioning under the good friday deal , something the dissident republicans do not accept			0
the report also said the two factions of the @entity55 have been the the most active and dangerous of all such groups , conducting 18 attacks on members of the security forces and those associated with them			2
each faction has its own structure and " army council , " the report said			2
" together , the two were responsible for a very major campaign of violence directed particularly at members of the security forces , " the report said			2
" it was the most serious paramilitary threat over the six months under review			2
" the attacks included an improvised mortar , pipe bombs , and shots fired at army and police targets			0
in august , a device in a hijacked taxi exploded outside a police station in @entity89 , causing substantial damage to property			0
" during the six months under review , the two factions of ( the @entity55 ) remained a very dangerous and potentially lethal terrorist threat , " the report said			1
" we are convinced that they would have taken the lives of members of the security forces if they had been able to do so in several of the attacks			0
" amid the rise in the number of bomb attacks , the number of casualties from shootings and assaults over the six - month period was " considerably lower " than in the recent past , something the @entity4 attributed to a reduction in the amount of violence inflicted on people for anti-social behavior like dealing drugs			1
" at a time when attention is rightly directed to the dissident threat , this trend should also be borne in mind , " the report said			0
@entity2 's @entity123 in @entity0 , @entity1 , and journalist @entity124 in @entity125 , @entity7 , contributed to this report .			0
