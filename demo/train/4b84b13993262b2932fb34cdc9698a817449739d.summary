some three months after @entity15 rebels declared an independent " @entity16 , " @entity13 government forces are encircling the city of @entity18			1
photojournalist @entity19 was in the city in may and returned two weeks ago to find it battle - scarred and slowly draining of life as its people flee			1
the images he has captured show the anguish of the immediate aftermath of shelling -- the relatives of victims , people left homeless , the dead			1
others depict those left behind sheltering in @entity34 or @entity35 - era cellars and boarded - up buildings as their homes are engulfed by the conflict			1
the photographs , many too graphic to show here , leave no doubt about the true horror of the destructive conflict			2
" if you go north of the city towards the airport you have entire areas that are no - man 's land -- they are not controlled by anybody and they are being shelled daily ... with mortars and tanks , " @entity19 tells @entity0			1
" you see some families that have remained there -- mostly elders and a lot of people that do n't really have any money , they have to stay			0
you also get people who stay because they do n't want to leave their homes			0
it 's been their family home for a long time and they have their belongings inside , so they want to stay close to that			0
" you do have a lot of elders who are pretty tough and they 're very pro-russian , so for them that 's also their struggle but a lot of them are hoping that this will end quickly			0

the day before @entity19 spoke to @entity0 , the group he was with -- fellow photographers and a local driver / translator -- had almost been killed in the town of @entity93			2
" it 's always hard when we see people getting killed where you are , that 's tough , because they 're just regular people and they 're not really involved in the war , " he says			0
the team 's driver was one of the residents trying to earn a living while it was still possible			2
many of those still facing the dangers of @entity18 have sent their children away , @entity19 says			1
the trains have stopped running from @entity18 , so the refugees travel by bus , many making the perilous journey through fighting in @entity116 region to reach @entity117			2
others go south to @entity119 , traveling through the conflict 's front line to safety , @entity19 says			1
there , where the fighting is at its most intense , photography is not welcomed by the rebels			0
" you can hang out with them if you want , but since just they get hit all the time and as you ca n't take pictures or photos there 's no reason to hang out with them , " @entity19 says			1
