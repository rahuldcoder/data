@entity0 -- a woman on the wrong end of a love triangle received a measure of support from the @entity7 on tuesday in an unusual case involving a domestic dispute , global agreements and local sovereignty			1
at issue is whether @entity13 may criminalize conduct -- under its treaty ratification power -- that is otherwise the domain of the states			0
@entity19 was given a long prison sentence in the federal system after being convicted of violating an international agreement on the use of chemical weapons			1
she would have gotten a much shorter sentence under state law			2
the case of toxic love has soap - opera elements , but @entity32 's lawyers argued she was being treated like a foreign terrorist instead of someone caught up in a domestic dispute			1
beyond this fact - specific dispute , the case touches on larger concerns about the strength and purpose of the @entity42 's 10th amendment , designed to preserve state power			1
it is also a question roiling the current political debate , especially among tea party conservatives in this post- 9/11 , security - conscious environment			0
the justices are using this case to explore the limits of congressional and presidential authority , with timely , far - reaching implications			2
" it would be deeply ironic that we have expended so much energy criticizing @entity58 , " for its government 's alleged use of chemical weapons in an ongoing civil war , said justice @entity54 , " when if this court were now to declare that our joining or creating legislation to implement the treaty was unconstitutional			1
we 're putting aside the impact that we could have on foreign relations			0
" professor accused of poisoning wife " i just would like a fairly precise answer whether there are or are not limitations on what @entity13 can do with respect to the police power , " chief justice @entity70 asked of the @entity73 administration 's top lawyer			2
" if their authority is asserted under a treaty , is their power to intrude upon the police power unlimited ? " @entity32 , a native of @entity86 , lived outside @entity87 and worked as a microbiologist			1
as a federal appeals court succinctly summarized the relevant facts in the case : " @entity32 was excited when her closest friend , @entity92 , announced she was pregnant			1
@entity32 's excitement turned to rage when she learned that her husband , @entity95 , was the child 's father			1
" the woman , known to her family as @entity100 , struck back by stealing dangerous a chemical -- arsenic - based 10 - chloro - @entity102 - phenoxarsine -- from her company			1
she also obtained potassium dichromate over the @entity105			0
both substances in heavy doses can cause toxic , even lethal harm with very little physical contact			0
the 42 - year - old then tried to poison @entity112 some two dozen times over several months , secretly sprinkling small amounts of the chemicals on an apartment doorknob , car door handles , and a mailbox			0
while suffering no more than a chemical burn on her thumb , @entity112 grew suspicious -- one of the chemicals was a bright orange powder			2
after getting little help from local police , in 2007 she called postal inspectors , who set up surveillance cameras			0
@entity32 was videotaped stealing mail and placing chemicals inside the mailbox and a car muffler , court records show			1
@entity32 admitted her guilt early on and claimed she never meant to kill @entity112 , but only wanted to cause her " an uncomfortable rash			1
" the defendant also said her friend 's betrayal caused an " emotional breakdown " that made her respond in such a shocking fashion			2
instead of being charged with simple assault , which may have gotten her six months to a year or two in state prison , @entity32 was indicted in federal court on two counts of mail fraud and -- the bombshell -- two counts of violating a federal law and international treaty on the possession and use of " chemical weapons			1
" when a judge denied her motions to transfer the case to state court , @entity32 pleaded guilty and immediately appealed			1
she received a sentence of six years behind bars and nearly $ 12,000 in fines and restitution			2
she was released in august 2012			0
did @entity160 doctor kill his wife ? during tuesday 's lively hour of arguments , @entity32 's lawyer , @entity162 , called the @entity164 an " odd statute " that clearly exceeds congressional authority			1
he said the treaty was designed to deal with " warlike " behavior , not " ordinary " poisoning cases			0
" i do n't think that nation - states poison romantic rivals , attempt to commit suicide , or try to get rodents out of their houses " using chemicals that might have everyday non-criminal uses , he said , like vinegar			0
" you are imagining a world in which judges day - to - day try to get inside the head of treaty makers , " where judges might say : " we understand that there 's a national interest in regulating sarin gas , but we do n't think that there 's a sufficient interest in regulating some other chemical down the line			1
it seems to me a completely indeterminate test " for judges to delineate " what is in the national and international interest			0
" solicitor general @entity198 agreed , defending the treaty and law by saying , " there ca n't be a ' too local ' exception to the treaty power			0
" the @entity204 says federal law broadly prohibits a person from knowingly using a chemical weapon in a way that can " cause death , temporary incapacitation , or permanent harm " to another person , which prosecutors said @entity32 admittedly did			1
@entity198 dismissed a " parade of horribles " -- hypothetical suggestions that a sweeping treaty could be authorized giving the federal government complete police power over the states			2
" it seems unimaginable that a convention of that kind would be ratified by two - thirds of the @entity226 , which it would have to be , " he said			0
" it also seems unimaginable that you would bring this prosecution , " against @entity32 , said justice @entity228			1
" but let 's leave it at that			2
" the remark brought laughter in the courtroom , but @entity228 clearly was not joking			0
test your knowledge of the @entity239 @entity7 justice @entity240 used the issue to delve into another controversial issue			1
" let 's assume that an international treaty is approved by two - thirds of the @entity226 and the president , which requires states to approve same - sex marriage			2
all right ? " he said			0
" now , if that were a self - executing treaty , same sex marriage would have to be approved by every state			2
if it is not self - executing , however , it will be up to @entity13 to produce that result , and @entity13 would do it by having a federal marriage law			2
" the conservative @entity240 said to do so would be " dragging the @entity13 into areas where it has never been before			0
" " if you told ordinary people that you were going to prosecute ms. @entity32 for using a chemical weapon , they would be flabbergasted , " said justice @entity258			1
" this statute has an enormous breadth -- anything that can cause death or injury to a person or an animal			0
would it shock you if i told you that a few days ago my wife and i distributed toxic chemicals to a great number of children ? on @entity277 we gave them chocolate bars			0
chocolate is poison to dogs , so it 's a toxic chemical under the chemical weapons convention			1
" again there was audience laughter , but no smiles from the bench			0
justice @entity289 also worried about the scope of federal power			2
" in principle your position constitutionally would allow the president and the @entity226 , not the @entity301 , to do anything through a treaty that is not specifically within the prohibitions of the rights protections of the @entity42 , " he told @entity198 , citing a 1920 high court precedent giving @entity13 the power to enact treaties , even if it steps outside its traditional constitutional authority by usurping state laws			2
" and i doubt that in that document the @entity306 ( of the @entity42 ) intended to allow the president and the @entity226 to do anything			0
" " i am worried about that and i think others are , too , " the left - leaning @entity289 added			0
among those attending the arguments was former justice @entity314			2
justices prepare for hot - button cases - and hot internal rhetoric there are about a thousand treaties signed by the @entity239 currently on the books			0
many academics and lawmakers hope the majority right - leaning bench will use this opportunity to delve further into the scope of the 10th amendment , which states , " the powers not delegated to the @entity239 by the @entity42 , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people			1
" in the broader political context , a bipartisan sphere of @entity239 worry the federal government and @entity13 have been overly aggressive in staking claims to disputes they believe are best left to states , especially in the criminal arena			0
and it is not just felonies			0
areas like gun ownership , zoning laws , environmental regulations , taxation , health care , and education standards all could be re-examined in the wake of this high court decision			0
some of @entity32 's supporters argue that some federal prosecutions are novel and the penalties are often more harsh , creating conflict and confusion with local efforts to ensure public safety			1
they see @entity32 as an unexpected hero in the fight to return " the power back to the people			1
" " the proposition that the @entity365 is a trump card that defeats all of the remaining structural limitations on the federal government is not a proposition that is logically defensible			0
" sen. @entity370 , @entity371 , said last week			0
@entity32 had won an earlier @entity7 appeal , with a unanimous ruling she had " standing , " or legal authority , to pursue her claims in the courts			1
that allowed her to continue trying to have her federal conviction tossed out , which is the current issue before the justices			1
her lawyers say she had been trying in recent years to repair her shaken marriage , and has come to terms with her husband 's betrayal			1
the case is @entity32 v. @entity239 ( 12 - 158 )			1
a ruling is expected by the spring .			0

@entity19 is challenging her conviction on a federal chemical weapon charge
she used poisons to try to get back at a woman who had an affair with @entity32 's husband
she received a measure of support from the @entity7 during oral arguments tuesday
the case touches on the conflict between federal and state powers in the 10th amendment
