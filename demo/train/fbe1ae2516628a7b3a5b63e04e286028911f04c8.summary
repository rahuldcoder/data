-- amid our vacations , fireworks and barbecues wednesday , it 's easy to forget that we are actually commemorating the signing of the @entity7			0
the most famous phrase from that document is one of our nation 's founding values : " all men are created equal			0
" as it happens , this july fourth week brings two significant victories for that value that are worth celebrating			0
most @entity17 are probably not aware that since 2011 , more than two dozen measures have passed that will make it more difficult for some eligible citizens to vote , denying them the opportunity to participate equally in our democracy			1
too often , it appears that politicians are trying to manipulate voting laws to save their jobs and pick their voters , rather than allowing all voters to choose their politicians			1
the good news is that the public , the courts and some elected officials have fought these new restrictions in several states , including @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and , just tuesday , @entity42			1
another view : voter id laws are common sense to the surprise of many -- at the urging of good government and voting rights groups , several editorial pages and many of @entity42 's citizens -- gov. @entity52 vetoed a package of restrictive voting laws in that state			1
one of the bills would have restricted voter registration drives			1
under that bill 's proposed rules , the @entity58 of @entity42 , which has conducted voter registration drives for decades , would need to attend mandatory , state - approved training sessions			1
but the law did not say how widely those trainings would be available			0
the law also would have required volunteers to sign an intimidating form threatening them with criminal prosecution for vaguely defined offenses			0
( in may , @entity17 district judge @entity69 stopped a similar requirement in a @entity72 law , saying this can have " no purpose other than to discourage voluntary participation in legitimate , indeed constitutionally protected , activities			1
" ) also this week , the state of @entity72 confirmed it will likely not resume its purge of the voter rolls , which gained national notoriety and could have kept thousands of eligible citizens from voting in november			1
@entity72 gov. @entity82 claimed the purge was necessary to get noncitizens off the registration rolls			1
of course , if a state confirms that noncitizens are on the rolls , it should take appropriate steps to remove them			2
but that is not what the @entity72 was doing			1
rather , the state created a list rife with errors that many local election officials warned from the start was inaccurate			0
this flawed list was used to send purge notices to hundreds of eligible citizens , disproportionately @entity99 and members of other minority groups			2
among them was @entity103 , a @entity105 - born 91 - year - old @entity104 veteran , who said he was " flabbergasted " when he received such a letter			0
another view : economic policies will discourage @entity99 , not voter id laws last week , the same judge who stopped part of @entity72 's registration law scolded the state for the " major flaws " in its purge , which was " likely to have a discriminatory impact " on the tens of thousands of newly naturalized citizens in the state each year			1
moving forward , @entity72 must create strict and uniform criteria for developing purge lists , as suggested in the @entity123 's 2008 " @entity128 " report , one of the first systematic examinations of the chaotic and largely unseen world of purges			2
sadly , the news is n't all good			0
the @entity123 estimates that 16 states have passed restrictive voting laws that have the potential to affect the 2012 election			1
these states account for 214 electoral votes , or 79 % of the total needed to win the presidency			0
elections should not be decided by politicians who manipulate voting laws for partisan gain			0
improving our elections need not come at the expense of our shared value that all citizens should have the opportunity to participate in our democracy			0
if we truly want to make our election system better -- and get past the voting wars seen in @entity72 , @entity42 and across the country -- the first step is to modernize voter registration , which could add more than 50 million eligible voters to the rolls , permanently			1
even though voter files are kept on computers , citizens must fill out paper forms to register , and can be dropped from the rolls due to errors or address changes			2
modernizing registration would use digital technology to enable citizens to register and stay registered to vote , and to update their registration online			2
in recent years , at least 21 states have moved forward to automate voter registration at @entity169 offices , a step supported by officials from both parties			1
experiences in the states demonstrate that this increases accuracy and registration rates , minimizes the potential for fraud and saves money			2
all eligible citizens should have the opportunity -- and responsibility -- to vote			0
the right way to honor our @entity185 is to ensure their bold ideals of equality of opportunity are upheld			0
let 's make our election system better , and reject measures that restrict access to the polls			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			2

@entity197 : since 2011 , more than two dozen restrictive voting measures have passed
*fortunately* , some states have rejected them , as @entity42 did tuesday , says @entity197
@entity72 will probably not resume its notorious purging of voter rolls , he says
@entity208 : modernizing voter registration could add 50 million eligible voters to the rolls
