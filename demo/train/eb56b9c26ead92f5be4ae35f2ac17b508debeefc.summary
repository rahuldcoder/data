@entity0 -- an @entity3 official involved in a 2010 conference cited for wasteful spending said thursday no rules were broken and no fraud occurred , though he acknowledged that video parodies , fancy hotel suites and other excesses funded by taxpayers never should have happened			1
" it 's embarrassing , and i apologize , " said @entity12 , the @entity3 official who portrayed the mr. @entity14 character in a training video for the conference that parodied the " @entity19 " television show and films			1
@entity12 told a congressional hearing that new federal regulations would prevent such a video and conference from occurring today			0
however , he said planners " followed @entity3 and government procedures that were in place at the time			0
" he also noted that an inspector general 's audit that revealed high hotel bills and other wasteful spending for the $ 4.1 million cost of the conference found no fraud occurred			1
" in hindsight , many of the expenses that were incurred at the 2010 conference should be been more closely scrutinized or not incurred at all , " said @entity12 , a 32 - year @entity3 veteran			1
his testimony under oath to the @entity42 followed fierce criticism from the panel 's top @entity44 and @entity46			2
@entity3 puts two on leave over lavish 2010 conference @entity44 chairman rep. @entity49 of @entity50 called the waste by the agency that collects taxes from the public " maliciously self - indulgent			1
" he noted that in some cases , @entity3 workers who received employee benefits from the conference failed to file @entity59 forms for the income , saying " the @entity3 effectively was guilty of tax evasion			2
" the panel 's ranking @entity46 , rep. @entity63 of @entity64 , berated @entity12 for wasting the money of people who earn less in a year than the cost of the " @entity19 " parody video			0
insisting he found " no redeeming value " from the video , @entity63 cited examples of working people in his neighborhood , such as a hotel cleaning woman he saw at the bus stop on thursday morning			0
" that is her money , the one who makes $ 35,000 , that 's her , " he told @entity12			0
" the gentleman up the street from me who makes $ 45,000 hauling trash			0
that 's their money and so , it was wasted			0
" thursday 's hearing was the seventh in recent weeks on controversies at the @entity3			1
the others focused mostly on the targeting of conservative groups seeking tax - exempt status that was uncovered in a separate inspector general 's audit made public last month			1
despite the public displays of outrage by legislators , @entity49 and @entity63 conceded that such wasteful @entity3 spending on conferences and travel no longer occurred due to government reforms			1
" it 's not a new occurrence and many of these things may not be happening today , " @entity49 said , while @entity63 credited both the committee and the @entity103 administration for taking effective action in response to a similar spending scandal involving the @entity107 that was uncovered in 2011			2
partisan views of @entity3 targeting : political conspiracy or overzealous scrutiny on wednesday , the @entity3 announced it has placed two employees on administrative leave in connection with the @entity119 , @entity50 , conference in 2010			1
@entity121 , the acting @entity3 commissioner appointed by president @entity103 last month to clean up the mess at the agency , said thursday the move was a step toward firing the two employees , who have not been identified			0
in his report on the conference spending made public on tuesday , treasury inspector general @entity126 said the @entity3 spent taxpayer dollars on everything from event planners ' commissions to speakers ' fees to guest prizes to parody videos			1
" questionable expenses " comprised much of the budget , according to @entity126 's report , which also said $ 3.2 million to pay for the conference expenses came from unused funds allocated for hiring			1
the august 2010 conference , held by the small business / self - employed division , had 2,600 attendees at three hotels in @entity119			2
@entity12 said the conference provided valuable training for new managers at the time , despite what he called inappropriate spending			0
that did n't satisfy the legislators from either party , who questioned how @entity3 employees notorious for being sticklers on compliance with the law did not realize or protest the excess and waste of the conference			2
@entity162 rep. @entity161 of @entity163 called the problem " a culture of arrogance and a real tin ear to the concerns of the public that pays the bill " rather than something criminal			0
@entity173 , an official in the inspector general 's office who helped conduct the spending audit , agreed with @entity161 , telling the panel it did n't appear to be fraud but rather " a case of people who lost sight of the fact they were spending taxpayer money			1
" while outrage over the wasteful spending was bipartisan , both sides sought to score political points on thursday			0
@entity49 , a leading @entity44 messenger in efforts to depict the @entity103 administration as government gone wild , complained of a " culture without whistle blowers " in the federal government and referred specifically to the targeting scandal his panel also is investigating			0
he wondered out loud how many @entity3 workers involved in the improper targeting could have benefited from better training and more staff paid for by the money spent instead on the @entity119 conference			2
@entity63 , meanwhile , noted that @entity3 spending on conferences doubled during the final years of the @entity44 @entity205 administration , when the nation headed into recession			1
" it would be legislative malpractice if we do n't figure out what happened there , " he said			0
some @entity44 sought to link the @entity3 controversies to @entity103 's health care reform law , pointing out the tax agency will enforce compliance with requirements for people to purchase health insurance			1
@entity44 rep. @entity220 of @entity221 said the problem was a " cultural , systemic , moral , character " issue at the @entity3 that no amount of training would solve			0
noting that people now will submit health information to the @entity3 , which already has their financial information , @entity220 said " those are details we do n't share with people we do trust			2
" @entity63 took exception with such remarks , saying that the misdeeds of some at the @entity3 did n't impugn the 90,000 - employee agency or its ability to do its work			0
" i do n't buy this because we had some bad players , we ca n't do the job , " he said , asking @entity121 if the @entity3 was up to the task of taking on the health care law 's mandate			2
" yes , " replied @entity121 , saying the @entity3 has reached all key milestones so far in preparing for its new responsibilities and adding he would be " very active in this area because it 's one our critical operational priorities			0
" on the targeting issue , @entity121 said the agency and the inspector general would soon be providing additional information on groups seeking tax - exempt status that came under extra scrutiny			1
in the inspector general report last month , an @entity3 unit that handles applications for tax - exempt status was found to be using criteria that included conservative labels such as " tea party " to target groups for extra questioning			1
@entity44 contend the targeting was political discrimination , but the report blamed poor management in dealing with unclear regulations and an increased workload rather than a political motivation			0
latest on the @entity3 inquiry @entity1 's @entity273 and @entity274 contributed to this report .			2
