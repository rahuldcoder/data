@entity0 , @entity1 -- the stands around the boxing ring were mostly empty and the bout was a mere three - round exhibition fight , but @entity7 battled as if a title was on the line			1
" if you want to be a great boxer in @entity1 , " he said , moments after being declared the winner , " you have to be willing to work hard and sacrifice			2
" @entity15 's drive is n't unique for @entity1			1
@entity17 , along with baseball , is a passion that runs deep for many of the island 's 11 million inhabitants			1
and despite @entity1 's small population , the country has been a consistent force to be reckoned with at the @entity25 , winning 32 gold medals in the sport			1
three of those golds went to @entity1 boxing legend @entity30			1
now 60 years old , @entity30 has lost the quickness in his step and he carries the scars of years of battle in the ring			2
but his eyes still light up when he discusses the sport that made him a household name around the world			2
" @entity1 like to box because of our temperament , " @entity30 said , with a smile creeping across his lips			1
" because of our idiosyncrasies and because we have needed to know how to defend ourselves			0
" after the 1950s @entity1 revolution , boxing was briefly banned by the country 's new leaders			1
but then -- like all sports -- it fell under the control of the government			0
today that remains the case as there are no professional sports in @entity1			1
in the 1960s , boxing trainers -- many of them @entity59 -- were brought into work with fledgling talent such as @entity30			1
@entity1 boxers ' amateur status let them compete in the @entity25 , but not on the high profile -- and high paying -- professional fight circuit			1
@entity30 famously turned a million - dollar offer to fight @entity67			1
other @entity1 fighters have chosen a different path , defecting and earning the huge purses not available to them in their home country			1
despite those losses , @entity1 's boxing commissioner @entity72 says there is a deep talent pool to draw from			1
" our strength comes from the heart , from patriotism , " he said			0
" our boxers may not have a million dollars but they have 11 million @entity1 who support them			2
" @entity72 said despite the country 's legacy of great boxers , he expected countries like @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 to provide strong competition at the 2012 olympics in @entity90			1
he believes @entity1 's advantage comes from the government 's ability to identify and cultivate emerging talent at a young age			2
" we can say with total certainty that in the farthest corner of @entity1 if there 's a talented boxer we know about him and are following his progress , " he said			2
" so that maybe one day he might join our national team			0
" the @entity103 boxing gym in @entity0 is one of the places where young boxers receive that encouragement from a young age			2
the students receive lessons as early as eight years old in the gym 's open - air ring			0
while the facilities are threadbare , the instruction they receive is world class			0
two - time olympic gold medal winner @entity117 runs the gym , teaching the children how to throw and take a punch			0
" what makes @entity1 different is the intelligence that we fight with , " he said , " our aggression , our tactics and the way we move			0
" @entity127 said most of the children at the @entity129 are boxing as an after - school activity			0
they will pick up the basics of boxing and confidence while never achieving greatness in the ring			0
boxing teaches them skills , he said , they can use in their everyday life			0
" we teach them the elements of boxing but also patriotism , " he said			0
" how you act in the classroom or on the street			0
it 's not just boxing			0
" @entity127 is looking for young fighters with drive and something to prove			0
because there among the gangly youths bobbing and weaving in his classes , @entity127 said , could very well be @entity1 's next champion of the ring .			2

boxing is a passion in @entity1 , rivaling baseball as the country 's national sport
professional sport is *outlawed* in @entity1 , but the country still produces world - class boxers
@entity1 *heavyweight* @entity30 won three golds between 1972 and 1980
the men 's boxing event at @entity177 *begins* at @entity90 's @entity179 center on july *28*
