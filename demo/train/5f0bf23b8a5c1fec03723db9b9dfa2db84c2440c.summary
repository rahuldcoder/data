-- in @entity3 's classic fairy tale , " @entity9 , " two swindlers promise an emperor new , beautiful clothes that are invisible to anyone who is unfit for their position , unjust or stupid			1
the clothes do n't actually exist , but the emperor pretends to see them anyway so it is not thought that he is stupid or unfit to be emperor			2
his followers and ministers do the same			0
it takes an innocent little child to say what no one else is willing to say : the emperor does n't have any clothes on			2
in the first presidential debate last week , the president had his emperor 's clothes moment in front of more than 60 million people			1
complete coverage : @entity0 's election center all the bright , beautiful robes of his presidency were reduced to nothing			0
he was unprepared , listless , and as @entity36 said , he did n't look like he even wanted to be there			0
@entity39 's empty chair , which earned the ire of liberal pundits , now seems ever so prophetic			0
but @entity3 's tale does n't end there			2
when the little boy exposes him , the emperor turns a blind eye and says , " this procession has got to go on			0
" @entity3 concludes the story , " so he walked more proudly than ever , as his noblemen held high the train that was n't there at all			0
" the procession went on this past weekend with the president 's noblemen , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , all taking to the sunday shows to insist that the real grievance was not president @entity60 's debate performance , not that he had no clothes , but that no one is calling @entity63 on his lies			1
ah , the modern day twist -- the child is a liar ! the problems in labeling @entity63 a liar are several			2
first , he did not lie			0
his tax plan would not raise taxes on middle - class families			0
in fact , @entity75 economist @entity74 says the @entity60 administration is misrepresenting his study on @entity63 's tax plan			1
second , calling @entity63 a liar blatantly ignores the reality of the debate : the president 's missing clothes and his terrible performance			1
while more than 60 million people witnessed the debate , the only people ignoring the president 's performance are his advisers and his closest ideologues			1
for four years @entity60 has been cosseted and insulated by the friendly mainstream media			2
his lack of interest in taking hard questions from the media and the media 's lack of interest in asking hard question showed during the debate			0
he was unprepared for @entity63 's aggressiveness and forcefulness			2
one can now only wonder how prepared he has been for the presidency these past four years ? third , if @entity63 was such a blatant liar , why did n't @entity60 say anything about it on stage during the debate ? @entity60 could n't put together a cogent defense of his own policies , let alone go on the offensive against @entity63 , which leaves little substance or truth to the case that @entity63 is a liar			1
or as @entity123 wrote , " how do you erase that imprinted first image from public consciousness : a president incapable of making a single argument or even a halfway decent closing statement ? " opinion : five ways @entity60 can bounce back fourth , the allegations of lies wo n't stick			1
as several commentators have said , @entity63 's brilliant debate performance obliterated $ 100 million in negative ads against him			1
the @entity60 administration 's caricature of @entity63 , as well as much of the mainstream media 's , as a vulture capitalist monster who only cares about the rich , was shattered			1
the problem with caricaturing someone is that the caricature better fit			0
on debate night it did n't , and it wo n't fit going forward			0
just how good was @entity63 's debate performance ? in a @entity0 / @entity143 conducted right after the debate , 67 % of debate watchers said @entity63 won			1
in the most recent @entity145 poll taken after the debate , @entity63 now leads @entity60 49 % to 45 % among likely voters			1
just last month , @entity63 trailed by 8 points among this group			0
that 's an incredible 12 - point swing less than one month away from the election			0
@entity63 's supporters are more engaged by 15 points , and his favorable rating now surpasses @entity60 's for the first time , 50 - 49			1
on the question of which candidate would best " improve the job situation , " @entity63 now leads @entity60 by 8 points			1
in september , @entity60 was winning likely female voters by 18 points			0
now , @entity60 and @entity63 are tied among women at 47 , a remarkable comeback for @entity63			2
his campaign is against the ropes			0
but if they think calling @entity63 a serial liar will make up the ground lost in the first debate , @entity60 may be even more unprepared for this presidential campaign than anyone thought			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			0

@entity175 : @entity60 had his emperor 's clothes moment at first debate
@entity173 : president 's supporters are wrong to call @entity63 a liar
he asks why did n't @entity60 *effectively* *challenge* @entity63 when on stage ?
@entity173 : @entity60 campaign is reeling , they *'re* trying to make up for lost ground
