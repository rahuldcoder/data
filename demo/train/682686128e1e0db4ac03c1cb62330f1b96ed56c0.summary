-- as @entity2 walks through the dusty streets of a slum on the outskirts of @entity6 , she passes pigs rummaging through piles of trash , and colorful saris hanging out to dry			1
in a nearby doorway , a girl and a boy sit with furrowed brows			0
the 26 - year - old is on her way to a makeshift classroom , where she runs regular music workshops for the community 's children			1
once inside , the expressions on the faces of her skinny pupils could n't be more different than those worn by the pair outside			0
the children sing , their bright eyes fixed on @entity2 , as three musicians accompany them with a ukulele , keyboard and rhythm eggs			1
@entity33 is home to some of the richest but also some of the poorest people in the world			0
the country has the sixth - largest population of billionaires worldwide , and yet more than 300 million @entity33 , or around a quarter of the population , lives on $ 1.25 or less a day , according to the @entity41			0
the children who live in the low - income communities of @entity6 's sprawling metropolis have more worries than most -- poverty , malnutrition , disease -- but above all , says @entity2 , they feel an overwhelming sense of powerlessness			1
in 2008 , @entity2 founded @entity51 , an arts education program that seeks to inspire @entity6 's underprivileged children to share their dreams and aspirations through music , and teaches them important life skills that they may not get from formal schooling			1
" music is a really powerful way of communicating and it 's a really powerful equalizer , " she says			1
" it also brings with it a whole host of learning and developmental benefits -- whether it 's learning math and rhythm , learning language and singing , or learning how to work together with other children			2
" over the last six years , the program has worked with at least 600 young people -- children who , @entity2 says , would never have a chance otherwise to hold a public platform or stand on a stage			1
her goal is to raise awareness of the importance of creative learning for children 's development , especially for the so - called " at risk " children , such as orphans , abuse victims , and beggars , that @entity90 supports			1
more than 200 musicians and artists have contributed to the program , and yet persuading teachers to make a long - term commitment to working with these communities can be as challenging as raising funds , @entity2 says			1
" music and arts are often relegated from the education system as much as the people we work with and the communities that live on the fringes of the city , " she says			1
but attitudes in @entity6 are gradually changing , and with them , the lives of the children are transforming too			2
" the biggest positive change that we see in the children , and the communities that we work in , is ... how learning music and performing music gives children a sense of achievement but also of confidence , and that goes a huge way in many other aspects and areas of their lives			0
" last year , the students wrote and recorded an album , and held a concert in the center of @entity6 in front of 500 people			0
around 170 children are taking part in the program this year			0
music has played an important role in @entity2 ' own life			2
she grew up listening to her mother sing old folk songs , and her brother is now a professional pianist			0
@entity2 was heavily involved in music at school and as a student at @entity140			2
her deep belief in the transformative power of music is the source of her passion for the work she does now			0
" seeing the program in action , it 's always deeply encouraging and deeply motivating , especially to see children enjoying the process of learning , not being afraid by it , " she says			2
" but it also reminds me that we have a really long way to go in trying to take this model of education to many , many more children in our city , but also in our country			0
