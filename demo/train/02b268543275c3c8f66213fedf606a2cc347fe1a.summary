-- visits to the controversial @entity2 by @entity4 officials , including the younger brother of prime minister @entity6 , ignited criticism from @entity8 and @entity9 , which see the visits as an homage to @entity4 's past wartime aggressions			1
over the weekend several officials , including @entity6 's brother , senior vice foreign minister @entity14 , visited the shrine , according to @entity16			1
the visits started last week as part of an autumn festival and included 159 members of the diet , @entity4 's national legislature			2
prime minister @entity6 refrained from visiting the shrine , but sent an offering			0
an editorial in @entity25 , a @entity8 state - run newspaper , blasted @entity4 officials for their deference to the shrine			1
" @entity8 and @entity9 will never accept the @entity2 , whether it is a matter of rationality or sensibility			1
no matter how much trade with @entity4 grows , or how interdependent their economies are , the positive elements are flushed away once the @entity4 politicians stage a group show at the shrine , " it stated			2
the @entity4 lawmakers who went to the shrine defended their decision to go to the site where 14 of @entity4 's class - a war criminals from @entity43 are enshrined with thousands of @entity4 soldiers			1
the group insisted the visits have been misrepresented by the foreign media and that the shrine is where @entity4 visitors go to " pray for peace			1
" the site , built in 1869 , enshrines those who " devoted their lives to their country , " the group said in a statement			0
past visits by @entity4 prime ministers and other political leaders to @entity2 have ignited a firestorm of controversy with @entity8 as well as @entity9 and @entity62			1
the shrine is regarded by those nations as a symbol of @entity4 's imperial military past			2
the visits are seen as honoring war criminals and denying its atrocities in @entity71			1
millions of @entity8 civilians and soldiers , and hundreds of thousands of @entity9 died in wartime			1
the @entity4 lawmakers who visited the shrine remained unapologetic			1
in 2012 : shrine visit could inflame tensions between @entity4 , @entity8 " how the war dead are commemorated is determined according to each country 's own culture and tradition , " the group stated			1
" this long tradition of homage and commemoration is a matter of national sovereignty and should not be subjected to distortion by outside interference and propaganda			0
" @entity91 , director of asian studies at @entity93 , described the shrines as " the talismanic ground zero of the unrepentant view of @entity4 's wartime history			0
" " to say that they 're going there only to venerate the war dead is disingenuous on their part , " he said			0
" on the conservative side , they cheer them on , because they represent a voice that finds @entity4 's war crimes as justifiable			2
on the left , the newspapers like @entity110 or @entity111 are quite critical of these visits , precisely because of the political mischief intended , " @entity91 said			0
an editorial published in the @entity4 newspaper , the @entity115 last week called on @entity6 to " establish a new way to pay a tribute to the war dead that allows @entity4 to remember them quietly and comfortably and does not cause diplomatic friction			2
" it stated : " we can not support visits to the shrine by the prime minister or other political leaders			0
" on sunday , @entity6 's cabinet minister @entity129 visited the @entity2 and maintained that he did not want to " irritate neighboring nations			2
" but he also added that , " offering condolence to the heroic souls that sacrificed their lives for the country and pledging for the peace for @entity4 and the world is a natural duty for a national diet member			0
" @entity8 officials summoned the @entity4 ambassador to the country last week to voice its displeasure			1
a spokesman for the @entity62 foreign ministry expressed " deep concerns and regret			0
" the cycle of @entity4 politicians visiting @entity2 , prompting foreign criticisms , is well - worn			1
" in a sense , if the @entity8 government or @entity62 government criticizes @entity4 for doing this , this gives them ( @entity4 politicians ) attention			1
and then they can say to voters , ' these countries are trying to bully us , they 're interfering with our internal affairs			0
' in a way , it creates a dynamic and they feed off the criticism in some sort of odd way , " @entity91 said			0
polls in @entity4 , he said , indicate that most oppose the shrine visits by the prime minister			2
whether @entity6 will visit the controversial shrine remains a source of constant speculation in east @entity71			1
@entity174 , the director of @entity175 , said approximately half of the general population support the shrine			0
" especially under the heating - up of nationalism in the current east - asian context , the number of supporters among the general public might have been growing , " he said			0
" if this is the case , some politicians may well think that visiting @entity2 can help in their re-election			0
" earlier this month , @entity188 secretary of state @entity187 and defense secretary @entity189 paid their respects , laying wreaths at the @entity192 in @entity193 , which sits less than a mile away from @entity2			2
the secular cemetery holds the remains of unknown @entity4 soldiers and citizens who died overseas during @entity43 the @entity188 ' visit was seen by many as suggesting an alternative to venerating the war dead at @entity2			1
" i think @entity6 has heard that message , " @entity91 said			0
" he has refrained from going to @entity2 in the spring , summer and fall festivals			0
i think he gets it , that not only it would complicate relations between @entity4 and it neighbors , but also its most important ally , the @entity188 " @entity0 's @entity211 contributed to this report from @entity193 .			0
