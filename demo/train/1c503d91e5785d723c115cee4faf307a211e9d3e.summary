@entity21 : is @entity7 collapse a wake - up call for football ? " i 've been into see him myself , as have his close family members , and had a conversation , a few words exchanged , that will remain private , which is a great sign , " he told reporters			1
" but i must stress it 's still very early in the process , the doctors have stressed that point			1
@entity7 still has a long way to go but it is encouraging signs			2
" i 've spoken to @entity36 his partner and his dad @entity39 about it and where we all were on saturday night certainly at this stage i would never have expected the improvement that 's come			2
" i have to mention the support he has had from countries all over the world			0
the qualities he has as a man , football pales into insignificance but he is an outstanding young individual and we pray he gets back to that level again			0
" even though the treatment given to @entity7 at @entity11 's @entity59 ground is widely credited with helping to save his life , the @entity56 said they are to review medical procedures in the wake of the 23 - year - old 's collapse			1
' @entity7 collapse proves i was right to quit the game , ' says ex pro chairman @entity69 told a sports industry event that an incident involving goalkeeper @entity72 in 2006 , which saw the @entity74 international fracture his skull , had been a wake up call for the football authorities			1

" we will do everything we can to make sure we reduce to the point of elimination , if we possibly can , things like that			0

when asked if @entity7 could make a full recovery @entity1 replied : " that 's something [ doctors ] have said has happened before but every case is individual			1
fears for stricken soccer player @entity7 's recovery " but we 've said before the two things @entity7 has that can help is that he is such a fit young man and the life he 's had he 's had to fight every step of the way along his young journey			1
those things will stand him in good stead			0
" he said @entity2 's players , most of whom had visited @entity7 since saturday evening , could be back in training on wednesday			1
@entity11 manager @entity149 said on tuesday he feared the worst for @entity7 when he collapsed , especially as he had previously coached the late @entity150 , who died of a heart attack while playing for @entity152 in 2003			2
" i signed @entity150 , i brought him to @entity124 , he played at @entity153 for me			0
he was a fantastic boy			0
when you saw [ doctors ] pumping [ @entity7 's ] chest you feared for the worst but the medical assistance was amazing , " he told a press conference			1
" it 's affected everybody who saw it			2
it was an unbelievable incident , we 've never seen anything like that before			0
" the last few days , you ca n't get the lad out of your mind , what happened			0
but the news is positive so we keep our fingers crossed			0
