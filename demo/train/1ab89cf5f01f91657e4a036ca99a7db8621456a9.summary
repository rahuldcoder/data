@entity1 's general election , the largest democratic exercise in history , begins monday			1
voters will elect 543 members to the lower house of parliament , which will then select the country 's next prime minister			1
here are 11 things you need to know about the world 's biggest election : 1			1
more than 814 million voters are eligible to cast ballots over the next month to elect the lower house of parliament , or @entity20 , up from 713 million voters in 2009			1
the @entity1 voting pool is larger than the total populations of the @entity24 and @entity25 combined			2
given the infrastructure in @entity1 , an election of this scale ca n't be done in a day			1
voting will take place in nine blocks over the next five weeks , to allow election authorities to tackle the daunting logistics of operating 930,000 polling stations			0
the vote counting will be carried out and concluded on may 16			0
it 's the economy , stupid			2
@entity1 's flagging economic performance is the election 's central issue			1
after registering @entity42 - style growth rates of 8 % to 10 % in the 2000s , @entity1 's economy slowed sharply in 2012			1
gdp growth now remains below 5 % , coupled with persistently high inflation			0
@entity1 politicians and academics remain divided over whether the country should focus its energy on first reigniting growth or on alleviating poverty			2
even after a decade of rapid growth , @entity1 is still home to one in three of the world 's poorest people			1
unlike other countries , @entity1 's poor tend to vote in higher numbers than the rich			1
the @entity58 and the " @entity60 wave			1
" @entity1 's main opposition party , the strongly nationalist @entity58 , is positioned to win the most seats in the lower house of parliament , though it is not likely to win the outright majority necessary to form a government without coalition partners			1
the @entity58 's prime ministerial candidate , @entity60 , has gathered momentum by positioning himself as an advocate for economic development and good governance			1
many expect @entity60 's business - friendly campaign to lead his party to its biggest victory ever			2
@entity60 's charisma and controversy			2
@entity60 has a strong record as chief minister of the state of @entity82 and a " strong man " reputation that many see as a welcome contrast to current prime minister @entity86			1
but @entity60 has also been criticized for his authoritarian bent and ties to right - wing @entity91 organizations			2
although an investigation set up by @entity1 's @entity94 cleared him of wrongdoing in 2012 , some voters remain suspicious of @entity60 's role in the 2002 @entity82 riots , in which 1,000 people , mostly @entity98 , were killed			1
the @entity99 denied @entity60 a visa in 2005 because of his alleged culpability , but it changed tack in march , saying it would welcome @entity60 to the @entity24 if he wins the election			2
infographic : @entity1 's vote by the numbers 5			1
the crisis of confidence in the @entity109			0
anemic growth , persistent inflation and frequent corruption scandals have tried the public 's patience with the @entity109 , the country 's oldest party and the core of the ruling @entity117 over the past decade			2
@entity118 , the heir to the @entity120 dynasty and the party 's choice for prime minister , has been portrayed as a reluctant leader , and some believe the @entity109 will be reduced to its lowest number of seats in history			1
for its part , the @entity109 criticizes the @entity58 's policies as exclusionary and emphasizes its social welfare programs , aimed at helping the poor			2
nepotism is here to stay			0
the competition between @entity120 and @entity60 has become something of a public referendum on @entity1 's entrenched political elite			1
@entity118 , who is the son and grandson of previous prime ministers , is depicted by critics as cosseted and out - of - touch , while @entity60 's campaign emphasizes his humble origins working for his father 's tea stall as a child			1
but despite @entity60 's popular appeal , research by @entity148 indicates nepotism remains alive and well in @entity1 politics			1
nearly 30 % of current members of parliament are from political families ; for parliamentary members younger than 40 , the figure rises to two - thirds			0
criminality among the @entity1 political class is endemic			2
an astonishing 30 % of the current parliament faces criminal charges			0
judging by the new crop of candidates , it is n't going to be much better in the new parliament			0
according to research published last week , almost a fifth of the candidates face criminal charges			0
by contrast , none of the sitting members of the @entity172 is facing criminal charges ; in 2013 , only two members -- or less than half a percent -- were convicted of a crime			0
put another way -- and this may come as something of a surprise to those many @entity24 readers who hold the @entity172 in low regard -- @entity1 parliamentarians are on average 60 times more likely to be charged with a crime than their @entity24 counterparts			2
corruption and criminality may prove hard to shake in @entity1 politics , since the rising cost of campaigns means they are dominated by the wealthy			0
the @entity193 estimates that @entity1 politicians may spend around $ 5 billion campaigning , triple the sum for the last national poll in 2009			0
the figure is second only to the $ 7 billion spent in the 2012 @entity24 presidential race , the world 's most expensive election			1
the role of young voters and social media			1
first - time voters are expected to make up roughly 10 % of those who will go to the polls this election			0
@entity1 's population is very young : more than 65 % , or nearly 800 million people , are younger than 35 , according to the latest census			1
this youth bulge is lending weight to candidates who prioritize economic development , as well as increasing the importance of social media in campaigns			0
young voters grew up after reforms to liberalize the @entity1 economy began in 1991 , and thus have high expectations for leaders to reignite @entity1 's growth			1
in large part because of the youth contingent , spending on social media advertising during the election may reach $ 83 million			0
the rise of the @entity228			0
an offshoot of the anti-corruption protests in 2011 - 2012 , the @entity228 galvanized support with its surprise showing in last year 's local elections for the @entity234			0
. the @entity228 won 28 of the legislature 's 70 seats and its leader , activist - turned - politician @entity237 , was appointed as @entity239 's chief minister			0
but while the @entity228 has energized young voters and the middle class , it has n't yet shown it can transition from a protest movement to a governing force			1
after failing to deliver on key election promises , @entity237 quit his post in @entity239 after only 49 days in office			0
the @entity228 is expected to take votes from more established parties in the election and could be instrumental in forming a governing coalition			0
women are raising their voices			0
long expected to vote in line with the male members of their families , @entity1 women are becoming an electoral force in their own right			2
women account for 48.5 % of the electorate , but in some recent polls , they have voted in higher numbers than men			0
inflation and safety are likely to be among their most pressing concerns as women control most household budgets and violence against women is an emergent political issue			0
the gang rape and subsequent death of a 23 - year - old woman in @entity239 in december 2012 and numerous other cases have sparked widespread protests and precipitated a reckoning of the position and treatment of @entity1 women			2
the key role of regional parties			0
no party has won an outright majority in @entity1 since 1989			0
this year 's results are likely to be the same , meaning @entity1 's regional parties will likely be instrumental in helping the @entity58 or @entity109 form a government			1
regional parties control five of @entity1 's biggest states -- @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity289 , @entity290 and @entity291 , which together account for more than 200 @entity20 seats -- and their wide variety of agendas and proclivities make determining @entity1 's future policy direction difficult			1
whether elected officials can deliver the decisive governance that @entity1 needs will depend in large part on the character and strength of the governing coalition .			0
