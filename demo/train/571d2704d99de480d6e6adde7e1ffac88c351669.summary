-- world champion @entity1 may have thought new teammate @entity3 would be his biggest threat of the new @entity6 season , but a surprise name will be at the head of the grid for saturday 's revamped final qualifying session in @entity11			1
rookie @entity12 , making his debut for @entity14 following the retirement of @entity16 and the departure of @entity18 , snatched top spot from @entity1 's @entity20 by just one - thousandth of a second in friday 's third practice			1
" practice today went pretty well -- better than expected , " @entity12 said			2
" i was very comfortable on the bike and this is the important thing			0
" what we are missing is a bit of pace and consistency			0
we will have to make the most of the 30 minutes that we have before qualifying tomorrow to improve those points			0
" under new rules for motorcycling 's elite class , the top 10 riders automatically go through to " @entity39 " to decide the leading start positions for sunday 's opening race , while in the earlier " @entity43 " the rest will fight for the remaining two spots to take part the pole position shootout			1
" it 's separated qualifying , so that the fastest group runs together and the slowest group runs together , " race director @entity48 said			1
" it 's one thing for the show , and the other really big reason is for the safety of the riders ; each rider group will get a clear race track and be better able to do their best lap time			1
" splitting the sessions will also give the sponsors of smaller teams more television exposure , the @entity6 website said			2
most eyes will be watching seven - time world champion @entity3 , who has returned to @entity20 after two unsuccessful seasons with @entity69			1
" the practices were not so bad , but we are continuing to work for the race , " @entity3 said			0
" we still have to decide which tire to use ; that will be very important for sunday			0
" the @entity75 earned fourth place in the practice sessions , behind @entity79 's @entity78 on a @entity80			1
@entity81 , his replacement at @entity69 , claimed sixth place ahead of last season 's championship runnerup @entity86 -- who was outshone by his new @entity14 colleague @entity12			2
another @entity89 rider , @entity88 , was seventh for @entity90 while @entity92 's 2006 world champion @entity91 was eighth on the second @entity69 ahead of @entity79 rookie @entity93 on the other @entity80 and @entity95 's @entity94 on an @entity96			1
the 20 - year - old @entity12 has moved up to the top division after winning the @entity99 title last year , and the 125cc class in 2010			0
with two - time world champion @entity16 quitting last season after becoming disillusioned with the sport , there is a gap for @entity12 to make his name			1
however , he will have to show he can be as consistent as @entity1 , who last season finished in the top two for 16 of 18 races -- with two retirements -- as he claimed his second title in three years			2
" i 'm very happy with the changes we made on the bike because it improved a lot , " @entity1 said			0
" i think we can still improve the bike more tomorrow			0
" we still have n't decided which chassis is better ; today it is the new one , yesterday the old one			0
i 'm very curious to see how the qualifying goes with the new formula -- we will just be concentrating on doing four fast laps and the maximum performance we can get			0
" before saturday 's two qualifying sessions , there will be one last practice run for the riders			2
" we 'll use the first three practices to get the right setups and then probably use the last free practice to do a long run , just to check the race situation , " @entity1 's crew chief @entity126 said on the @entity6 website			1
" it 's not exactly the race distance , but half an hour should be enough -- and then we 'll prepare for the time attack ! "			0
