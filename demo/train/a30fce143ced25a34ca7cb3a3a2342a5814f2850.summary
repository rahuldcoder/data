-- @entity1 has completed his widely - expected return to @entity3 after the @entity5 club ended weeks of speculation by confirming monday that the former @entity8 coach has agreed a four - year contract			1
" i am delighted to welcome @entity1 back to @entity3			1
his continued success , drive and ambition made him the outstanding candidate , " @entity3 chief executive @entity10 said in a statement			0
" it is our aim to keep the club moving forward to achieve greater success in the future , and @entity1 is our number one choice as we believe he is the right manager to do just that			2
" he was and remains a hugely popular figure at the club and everyone here looks forward to working with him again			0
" in his first interview since taking charge , the @entity31 told @entity34 that he was offering fans the same qualities that he did when he first took charge of the club nine years ago -- namely , a pledge to deliver quality work , love and passion to bring success to the @entity44			0
" it is exactly the same message but now i can say i am one of you -- and that makes a little bit of a difference , " he said			0
" in football , i had in my career two great passions : @entity54 and @entity3			2
@entity3 is more important for me			0
" it was very , very hard to play against @entity3 - i did it only twice , which was not so bad -- so now i promise exactly the same things that i promised in 2004 , with the difference that i am one of you			2
" after leaving @entity3 in 2007 , it was not until 2010 that @entity1 returned to @entity59 as a visiting coach , winning a @entity62 quarterfinal 1 - 0 in march 2010 to seal a 3 - 1 aggregate win for an @entity54 side who would go on to lift that year 's trophy			1
@entity3 said the 50 - year - old would bring his three coaching staff -- @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 -- who will work alongside the current first - team coaches @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			1
@entity1 first joined @entity3 on june 2 , 2004 and dubbed himself " the @entity76 " after having led @entity77 to the @entity79 title the previous season			1
he was unable to take @entity3 to the @entity62 final , but guided the club to two successive @entity5 titles -- its first @entity85 championship successes since 1955			1
after falling out with @entity3 's @entity87 owner @entity86 in 2007 , @entity1 joined @entity54 the following season and won two successive @entity91 @entity90 titles and the @entity62 in 2010			1
he was then courted by @entity8 with the goal of ending the club 's long wait for a record - extending 10th @entity79 title , but despite winning @entity96 in his second season @entity8 fell three times at the semifinal stage of the @entity62 and his relationship with key @entity102 players such as captain @entity103 deteriorated			1
as in @entity91 , he had a prickly time with the local press -- who took every opportunity to publish stories about dressing - room unrest at the @entity110			0
@entity8 announced last month that he would be leaving , despite having signed a contract extension until 2016			2
@entity1 's final game in charge of was saturday 's 4 - 2 win over @entity115 , which left the @entity102 club in second place in @entity96 -- 15 points behind @entity119			2
he did not talk to reporters after the match , though he did an interview with @entity102 television in which he denied omitting goalkeeper @entity103 and defender @entity124 -- with whom he has had public disputes -- and top scorer @entity127 for any other reason than they were not fit enough to play			0
last month he described this season as the worst in his career after losing the @entity133 final to @entity134 , meaning no trophy for @entity8 in 2012 - 13			2
" i wish everyone associated with @entity8 much happiness in the future , " he said in a statement on friday			0
" i appreciate the support of lots of fans and respect the criticism of others			0
once again , a lot of happiness to everyone and , above all , good health			0
@entity147 ! " his return to @entity3 was one of the worst - kept secrets in world football -- the @entity5 jumped the gun by announcing his reappointment sunday before a deal has been done			1
the @entity5 's website published a story , dated monday , with the headline " @entity1 makes @entity3 return			1
" its subheader read : " @entity31 coach back at @entity59 after signing a xx - year contract			1
" the story was taken down , and the @entity5 issued a statement apologizing to @entity3 -- which was searching for a new manager following the departure of interim coach @entity165			0
" it was a publishing error			0
we took it down as soon as we were notified of it , and we 've spoken to and apologized to @entity3 , " the @entity5 said			0
@entity165 led @entity3 to third place in the @entity5 , guaranteeing a place in the @entity62 next season after taking over from the sacked @entity171 in november			1
the @entity172 also took @entity3 to success in the @entity174 , with the club having dropped to the second - tier competition after becoming the first @entity62 winner to fail at the group stage the following season .			2
