in an article published monday by the @entity24 , the team of researchers says an analysis of the genetic history of @entity27 and other peoples indicates the contact with @entity3 took place roughly 4,000 years ago			1
that period coincides with the arrival of the dingo in @entity5 , according to archaeological records , suggesting the @entity3 migrants may have brought the wild dog with them , the genetic study says			1

they based their findings on large study of genetic data from aboriginal @entity5 , @entity51 , island @entity52 and @entity3			2
their analysis supported the theory that indigenous groups in @entity5 , @entity51 and the @entity57 are descendants of a wave of migration out of @entity61 tens of thousands of years ago			0

people from @entity3 arrived in @entity5 about 4,000 years ago , a genetic study says
that means they arrived long before @entity4 begun settling the continent
the research challenges the view that @entity5 was *isolated* for nearly 40,000 years
the @entity3 may have brought dingoes and new tool techniques to @entity5
