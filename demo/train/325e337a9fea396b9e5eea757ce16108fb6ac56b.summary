" ( @entity5 's ) nuclear weapons serve as an all - powerful treasured sword for protecting the sovereignty and security of the country , " a foreign ministry spokesman said , according to the state - run @entity13 news agency			1
" therefore , they can not be disputed ... as long as the @entity2 nuclear threat and hostile policy persist			1
" the stern statement marked the latest in the war of words , and more , pitting @entity5 against the @entity2 and , in fact , many other countries worldwide			0

@entity2 to beef up missile defense against @entity5 , @entity57 @entity5 blamed the @entity2 on saturday for " having compelled ( @entity5 ) to have access to nukes " because it " escalated the situation of the @entity61 to an extreme phase			0
" the statement challenged claims that @entity5 was pursuing its nuclear program as a " bargaining chip " to gain economic benefits through negotiations , such as food and other humanitarian aid			2
" the @entity2 poor temptation that it would help ( @entity5 ) if the latter makes other choice ( s ) may work on other countries , but it sounds nonsensical to ( @entity5 ) , " the foreign ministry spokesman said			0
