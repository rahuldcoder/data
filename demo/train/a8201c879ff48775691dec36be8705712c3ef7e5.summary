@entity0 , @entity1 -- insulated in designer skiwear against a temperature of -15 ° @entity5 , three of @entity1 's burgeoning ski set bundle into a gondola headed to a wind - swept mountaintop in @entity10 province , @entity1			1
these new members of @entity1 's skiing elite had traveled from @entity13 three hours drive away for a day 's skiing at @entity15 , @entity0 , and clearly relished hurtling downhill at one of the country 's newest high - end resorts			1
" control your speed " is good advice for any novice skier , but it could be equally applied to the growing number of businesses aiming to tap into the nascent @entity24 skiing industry			2
skiing is just the latest market in @entity1 touted to " boom " as an increasingly affluent middle class finds new ways to spend their wealth and leisure time			1
the @entity34 put the number of skiers in @entity1 at 5 million in 2005 , up from just 200,000 in 2000			1
the association predicts 20 million skiers by 2014			1
" but around 80 percent will probably never do it again , because the experience is so bad , " says @entity39 , ceo of @entity40 resorts the developers of @entity15 , @entity0			2
it 's a factor that has held back the momentum of the @entity24 ski industry , where the image is still one of bumpy nursery slopes crowded with first - time skiers snow - ploughing into one another			1
" the industry is n't developing as fast as it should , " says @entity52 , president of @entity53 , a @entity54 - based resort industry consultancy			1
" ninety percent of skiers are still considered beginners and rent their equipment			0
the quality of the product and safety has often been questionable , service has been poor			0
" @entity39 hopes @entity63 will provide @entity24 skiers with a five - star destination resort that keeps novices coming back to the slopes			1
others developers are following suit			0
@entity71 resort company @entity70 plans to open a dedicated ski village in @entity1 at the end of the year , the first of five the company plans to open by 2015			1
@entity1 's @entity75 have plans on a resort in the mountains bordering @entity79 , and a resort called @entity81 is being developed outside of @entity54 near the @entity82			1
since opening last year @entity63 has gained accolades , including @entity86 's @entity85 - over in 2009			2
@entity0 was also the site of the @entity88 in 2009 , with a reported $ 400 million invested by the government in updating the facilities and improving transport links to the area , making it the base for @entity1 's national ski team			1
for @entity39 , however , transforming a sleepy town with one aging hotel at the bottom of a mountain has been far from a smooth ride			0
" to be perfectly honest , it 's been a struggle , " says @entity39			0
" it 's easy to have a mountain in @entity1			1
people often ask , ' why did you put [ the resort ] here ? ' there are beautiful mountains [ elsewhere ] , but too far from the market			2
@entity24 people travel like @entity112 ; they 're @entity113 travelers			0
" with over $ 100 million invested in @entity15 , @entity39 hopes it will be the centerpiece of the new face of skiing in @entity1 , offering more than just well - groomed slopes and après - ski with a @entity24 twist			1
" it 's a combination of operations and real estate , you ca n't sell luxury homes if you do n't sell luxury products , " says @entity39			0
a new boutique hotel at the top of the 1000 - meter mountain will open next year and capacity eventually expanded to 15 hotels			0
but it is the resort 's real estate that will be just as important to how fast the area develops			2
around 75 houses are already built with almost a thousand more nestled on the mountainside planned for the next 10 years			0
" the concept of buying a recreational home in the mountains when it 's -20 ° @entity5 is not something the @entity24 have grasped yet , " says @entity52			0
" the ski market [ in @entity1 ] is so small that you ca n't expect to put $ 100 million into a project and hope to recoup that any time soon off your ski operations			1
but the leisure real estate market is also immature in @entity1			1
" as well as selling the resort as an investment opportunity , nurturing the culture of skiing is part of the development			1
its absence is something that @entity52 believes is really hampering the market			0
" when i went to work in a ski resort it 's because i wanted to ski all day and party all night			2
the people who go to work in @entity24 ski resorts do n't have any aspirations to do any of those things , " says @entity52			2
a few gold medals by @entity24 skiers at the @entity167 could help create a buzz around the sport itself , but for @entity39 and @entity52 , presenting a gold - standard lifestyle is just as important			2
" all their gear is high - end , because of course it represents their status			0
and that 's why we 've chosen to go higher end , because those kinds of customers want to be with us , " says @entity39 , who plans to add vip gondolas with heated seats and sound system at @entity15 , as well as slope - side tea service			0
" you ca n't just pick up a @entity188 or three valleys pop it into @entity1 and expect it to be successful , " adds @entity52			0
" because while @entity24 skiers want all the positive trapping they also want something that is theirs -- food and cultural elements , but delivered at a much higher level			0
" the younger generation is getting money , traveling and getting more adventurous , they 're the ones who are going to define the industry			0
