-- every holiday season we are cursed with the same challenge : to articulate exactly how fond we are of our friends and family in the language of purchasable objects			1
appreciate specific virtues of the people you 're buying for and connect those qualities to fabulous presents			1
this begs a couple of questions , like , " how do i shop for gifts that please both my brother and his wife without offending my own soul ? " even if you love your brother dearly , you might spend way too much and give him a @entity22 designer tablecloth covered with a really terrific artichoke print , which would prompt his cute but rigidly uptight wife to say something like " artichokes ? wow			1
@entity28 ; only you would give us something like that ! no , really , it 's great ! " and another deep and philosophical question : " how the hell am i supposed to express fondness for my extremely fancy friends when i have only $ 40 ? " deciding i needed a psychic obstacle course that would train me to emerge victorious in this upcoming battle , i arrived at a strategy : i would theoretically buy gifts for people who were absolutely impossible to shop for			1
@entity0 : free ( or really cheap ! ) gift ideas if i could climb these holiday @entity44 , i could find presents for anyone			2
i asked myself : " who in the world would best represent my worst nightmares in the area of budget holiday shopping ? " and i came up with a holy celebrity trinity : @entity54 ( the mind - bogglingly fashionable , ex-supermodel wife of the president of @entity22 ) , @entity58 ( the half - @entity60 father of six , at last count ) , and ultracouple @entity62 and @entity64 ( who i technically counted as one since i wanted to get something they 'd both like )			1
my budget for each : around $ 40			1
obviously , this mission was going to require an insane level of creativity -- especially in a city like @entity74 , where everything is so monstrously expensive			2
so i called women 's clothing designer @entity76 at his new boutique inside @entity79 , a posh yet quirky department store filled with enormous golden @entity81 and strange chandeliers , and asked him to accompany me			0
" we should get my friend @entity84 to take us to @entity85 , " he offered			0
i knew immediately what @entity76 was getting at			0
the @entity85 section of @entity91 is a fertile mix of @entity94 families , art school hipsters , neighborhood discount stores , and specialty shops crammed to the ceiling with exotic imports			0
@entity84 -- writer and artist @entity97 -- met us at @entity99 , a legendary discount store that sells everything from leather baby pants to @entity104 shower fixtures			0
we agreed that when shopping on a budget for people rich enough to buy their own islands , the goal was to find objects that would underline qualities we liked about them , and let them know we understood their particular needs			1
" i think @entity58 would appreciate something that helps him control his children , " i suggested			1
" i mean , he has so many of them			0
we need to find him a six - headed lollipop , or something that can keep the kids consolidated in space for a few minutes so he can rest			2
" @entity0 : the secrets of thrifty shoppers we found a gift that , with just a little bit of creative doctoring , might do the trick : an xxx - large t - shirt featuring the late hip - hop artist @entity127			2
" we could cut five more neck holes in it and call it a six - pac , " said @entity84			2
this masterpiece of modern babysitting cost only $ 8.99 , which would enable us to buy more child management aids			1
but i was n't satisfied that @entity58 would be as thrilled with it as i wanted him to be			1
" hey , check this out , " said @entity84 , having already moved on to @entity54			1
" it 's a camouflage duffel bag featuring a fake @entity140 's logo			0
" even more beguiling was a secret pocket outside the bag , the fabric of which was printed with the image of a cheerful , anthropomorphic @entity22 fry			0
the price : only $ 4			2
@entity0 : gifts that give back true , madame @entity54 might love it			1
she is , after all , a tastemaker			0
still , we wanted to see what they had at a few smaller shops			0
a bobble - headed decoy owl ? perhaps @entity54 could use it to keep pigeons off statues of her husband ? no.			1
. then we came upon the @entity162 , which promised that we 'd be able to " give a gift with @entity164			0
" " look , hanging in the window ! " i screamed			0
" it 's the gift that perfectly reconciles @entity54 's @entity168 , freewheeling past , her new diplomatic role as a high - profile political wife , and her much - maligned singing career ! " it was perfect : a tambourine in the shape of a peace dove			1
it really said it all , and for the low , low price of $ 21.99			2
score ! with that , we turned to the grueling task of shopping for @entity62 and @entity64			1
since they are quintessential show people and are no doubt on the road a great deal of the time , living out of @entity190 steamer trunks in six - star hotels with @entity193 teams of hair and makeup artists , we wanted to find them something that would strike the right balance of sophisticated flair and down - home comfort			1
we came upon a $ 14 pair of boxer shorts covered with bags of money hanging on a rack in front of a clothing store ( unlike @entity99 , many of the smaller places have no visible names ) , which we thought mr. @entity62 might appreciate			1
another nameless discount store had a fantastic @entity213 chart for identifying the different hair bun attachments it sold			0
perhaps , we agreed , we could buy @entity64 half a dozen of the various $ 7 " donut buns " and throw them into a @entity220 box for extra whimsy ! but neither of these options was really singing to us , maybe because they did n't speak to the couple 's celebrated togetherness , which was the original sentiment behind buying them one gift			1
" oh , stop -- these are it , " @entity84 suddenly enthused as we passed a small , anonymous shoe store			0
" these bandanna slippers are absolutely @entity231 2009 ! " " actually , " said @entity76 , " they are really nice			2
" the price : $ 19.99			2
we decided to buy red slippers for @entity64 and blue for @entity62 besides satisfying our criteria ( snazzy yet relaxing ) , since mr. and mrs. z " tied the knot , " this matching - scarf footwear could serve as a lasting symbol of a peaceful @entity243 marriage			1
i was very pleased so far ... but i did n't feel we 'd completely succeeded with @entity58 , so we wandered into a store called @entity246 that featured items of a @entity249 nature			1
" hey , these could be great for @entity58 , " said @entity76			1
the air in the room started shimmering , because he had , indeed , found some divine objects : a stack of six child - size straw porkpie hats			1
they were utterly hip , as if designed for miniature jazz musicians			0
we figured if @entity58 could manage to get all of his adorable children to wear the hats at the same time , like a global version of the @entity261 , he could sell the photo to a tabloid for more than $ 4 million and donate the proceeds to the charity of his choice			1
at $ 10 each , the hats were a tad beyond our price range			1
but we decided we 'd splash out and spend the extra $ 20 , since eventually they could end up housing , say , 30,000 displaced persons			2
we 'd put @entity273 on the gift card , too , and then we would n't have to buy her anything at the last minute			2
we were suffused with the joy of giving			0
@entity278 accomplished , we found ourselves considering the plight of the @entity280			0
even with an unlimited royal budget , it still must have been difficult to shop for a newborn messiah			0
but they looked around their respective kingdoms and gathered up the swankiest stuff they could find			0
in the earliest example of holiday gift giving , it was the thought and the effort that counted			0
all in all , i came away with one really valuable lesson			0
you can learn a lot by shopping outside your ordinary consumer comfort zone			0
and during our practice pilgrimage , @entity76 , @entity84 , and i remembered what 's important about the whole insane gift hunt : appreciating specific virtues of the people we 're buying for , and connecting these qualities , with love , to fabulous presents			2
