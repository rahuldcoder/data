-- just what is it that separates a champion athlete from the also - rans ? natural talent , hard work and determination are all essential , but athletes and coaches are becoming increasingly aware of the crucial role diet plays in sporting success			1
@entity13 athletes are fueled by high - carb diets			0
dr @entity15 is national lead for performance nutrition at the @entity18 ( @entity19 ) and helped make the @entity21 's most successful games for a century			0
" a good diet is n't going to turn a mediocre athlete into a champion , but a champion eating a bad diet may just miss out , " she told @entity0			2
training is the key to improving athletic performance , and the right diet is the key to sustaining a punishing training regime			1
your body uses glycogen stored in the muscles to provide the energy needed for exercise , and the body makes that glycogen by breaking down the carbohydrates you eat			1
so carbohydrates are the vital fuel needed for training , and the more training an athlete does , the more fuel they need			1
sprinters will often train for just an hour a day , whereas an endurance athlete will train for three hours or more			1
to sustain that level of training , sprinters need to eat around 5g of carbs per kg of body weight every day , whereas endurance athletes need at least 7g per kg. for @entity57 sprint sensation @entity56 , that means consuming some 450g of carbs a day , whereas , while @entity61 distance demon @entity59 would need at least 380g			1
despite doing less training , @entity56 would have to eat more carbs simply because he weighs more			1
so what 's the fuel of choice for these elite athletes ? " in general , endurance athletes are better about getting a variety of carbs , just because they have to eat so many they get bored			1
they 're good at mixing up pasta , rice and potatoes , " says @entity15			0
because " strength - and - speed " athletes do less training than endurance athletes , they have to watch their weight			1
@entity79 says sprinters often favor low glycemic - index carbs to help them keep their weight in check			0
what is the glycemic index ? carb consumption becomes crucial when athletes are training more than once a day			1
@entity15 says it 's essential that athletes refuel between training sessions , otherwise they risk fatigue , which can weaken their immune system and make injury more likely			1
she also stresses the importance of refueling immediately after training , when the body restocks glycogen at a higher rate			2
when it comes to this kind of rapid refueling , athletes load up on high glycemic - index carbs , which the body can better convert to glycogen -- and then to energy			0
but man can not live by bread alone			0
protein is needed for building and repairing muscle and is essential in the diet of athletes and non-athletes alike			2
surprisingly , the protein recommendations for elite athletes are much the same as for regular folks			0
a confirmed couch potato needs about 0.75g of protein per kg of body weight per day , while someone doing regular activity -- about an hour of a day -- needs some 1.2g/kg			2
endurance athletes need about 1.3g/kg and strength and speed athletes , with their extra muscle volume , need about 1.5g/kg			2
even once the competition has begun , nutrition has a role in keeping the body working at its best			0
in endurance events , from distance running to tennis , the main danger for an athlete is dehydration			1
" in a marathon the runners need to refuel and rehydrate and one of the best ways of doing that is with a sports drink			2
they provide carbs for fuel and there 's salt in there to help with electrolyte loss and help with the absorption of the water , " says @entity15			0
as well as eating the right food , athletes use a host of ergogenic aids to maximize performance			0
for example , some athletes use buffers such as sodium bicarbonate and sodium citrate to neutralize the lactic acid that builds up in the blood during exercise , fending off fatigue , while others choose to have a caffeine boost on race day			2
@entity15 says the @entity19 uses over 100 ergogenic aids to aid performance , as well giving athletes assorted anti-oxidants , fish oils and amino acids to boost their immune system			0
diet is a serious business at the @entity19 , which employs 18 nutritionists			0
although performance nutrition was only brought in to the set up in 2005 , it has clearly had an impact on @entity183 sport			0
at the @entity184 @entity183 won nine golds -- at the 2008 games team @entity186 won 19			0
while nutrition alone can not take the credit for that remarkable improvement , when @entity191 hosts the @entity13 in 2012 , the competitors will be all too aware the right diet could be the difference between gold and silver			1

the right diet can be the difference between a gold and silver medal
carbohydrate intake is the key to sustaining a punishing training regime
a sprinter like @entity56 needs to eat 450g of carbohydrates each day
rehydration with sports drinks is essential during endurance events
