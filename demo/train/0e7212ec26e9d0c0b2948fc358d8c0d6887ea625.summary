-- seven - time world champion @entity1 could be set to make a shock return to @entity3 as @entity5 look for a short - term replacement for the injured @entity7			1
@entity1 remains very much part of the @entity5 set - up as an advisor for the @entity3 team			1
the 28 - year - old @entity12 is currently in intensive care at the @entity15 military hospital in @entity16 after suffering a fractured skull in a freak accident in qualifying for saturday 's @entity20			1
@entity7 's condition has improved in the past 24 hours with doctors taking him out of a medically - induced coma on monday night			1
he has since responded well to questions and @entity25 , the medical director of the hospital , claimed on tuesday morning that @entity7 might be able to walk out of the hospital in 10 days ' time			1
@entity7 's crash in pictures			1
Â» " my expectation is that he would walk out of the hospital on his own			0
if his recovery continues , i would n't rule out that he could leave within 10 days , " @entity25 told @entity35 tv channel @entity34			0
" he 's spending more and more time awake , talking to family and friends			0
i would like to point out that , although he is recovering , this is not the end of the story , he is still in a life - threatening condition			0
of course , the danger is decreasing by the day			0
" while the news regarding @entity7 's condition continues to be encouraging , behind the scenes @entity5 are faced with the task of finding a replacement driver			1
doctors have said @entity7 will be out for at least six weeks , although there are still fears he may never return as a result of his injuries			1
he will certainly miss the @entity56 and @entity57 @entity55 at the end of august , although the current four - week break before the next race in @entity61 gives the @entity63 team time to assess their options			0
on the list of likely replacements could be @entity1 -- who won five of his drivers ' titles with @entity5 and works as an advisor for the team			1
the 40 - year - old @entity73 's representative @entity72 told @entity0 : " there is no offer from @entity5 , but if they decided they need him , @entity1 would certainly weigh his options			1
" @entity5 spokesman @entity79 later confirmed to the @entity80 that @entity1 , who retired in 2006 , was an option			2
" we have said before that it is possible that @entity1 could return to help us out , " said @entity79			1
" however , we have two test drivers at @entity5 ( @entity85 and @entity86 ) at the moment and @entity1 is an advisor			2
does safety need to be improved in @entity3 ? " we have not spoken to him and we will have to wait and see what happens			2
it is something for ( @entity5 team principal ) @entity92 to consider over the coming weeks			0
" we need to see how @entity7 is and the situation will evolve from there			2
we are not in any hurry , the first and foremost thing is @entity7 's recovery			2
" @entity79 also provided further encouraging news regarding @entity7 , although he played down @entity25 's assertion that he could walk out of hospital as early as next week			2
" i think that on monday he improved a lot but we have to remain cautious , " he said			0
" it is not useful to put forecasts on these things			0
i think for the moment we should just enjoy the positive improvements that @entity7 is making			0
" @entity7 was hurt when a spring that had fallen from the back of @entity111 's @entity110 car struck him on the helmet at high - speed , causing him to lose control of his car and crash into a tire barrier			1
on monday , professor @entity118 , the surgeon who operated on @entity7 over the weekend , told reporters that @entity7 had suffered some damage to his left eye , which could threaten his future in the sport			0
" it 's too early to say about his future as we do n't know the extent of the damage			0
without an operation it 's very hard to evaluate the eye 's function , " said @entity126			0
@entity7 's crash came less than a week after @entity133 driver @entity132 , the son of former world champion @entity134 , was killed in similar circumstances , knocked unconscious by a tire which flew off another car in a race at @entity139 in @entity140 , before crashing			1
@entity3 's safety record has improved dramatically in recent years , with the last fatality in 1994 when the legendary @entity12 @entity143 crashed at @entity144 .			0

@entity1 could be set to make a *surprise* return to @entity3
