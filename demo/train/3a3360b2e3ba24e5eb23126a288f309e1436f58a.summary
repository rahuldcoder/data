-- an asteroid the size of an aircraft carrier passed within the moon 's orbit tuesday , the closest approach by an object that large in more than 30 years			2
asteroid 2005 @entity9 passed within 202,000 miles of @entity10 -- about four - fifths of the distance to the moon -- at 6:28 p.m. tuesday , @entity8 said			1
@entity14 , a researcher at @entity8 's @entity15 in @entity16 , said the space agency was able to train a great deal of high - powered instruments -- including the massive radio telescope at @entity21 , @entity22 -- on the asteroid as it approached			1
" this is a rare event , and we learned a lot , " @entity14 told @entity0			1
follow space and science news on @entity28 though the space agency classified the asteroid as a " potentially hazardous object , " it posed no threat of a collision , according to @entity8 's @entity35			1
if the asteroid had crashed into @entity10 , it could have caused a 4,000 - megaton blast and a magnitude 7.0 earthquake , according to scientists at @entity41			2
if it fell into the ocean , it could have caused a 70 - foot - high tsunami within 60 miles of the crash site , the experts said			0
the last time a space rock in the same league as 2005 @entity9 passed as close to @entity10 was in 1976 , @entity8 said			1
the next similar encounter is projected for 2028 , @entity14 said			0
podcast : asteroid close encounter as the object neared @entity10 , @entity8 studied the asteroid with the @entity55 radar antennas in @entity16 's @entity56			1
goldstone antennas are very sensitive radio telescopes used to investigate quasars , radar mapping of planets and comets			0
scientists plan to reconstruct the shape of the asteroid with a resolution as fine as 13 feet ( 4 meters ) using the antennas			0
share your view of the asteroid the approach also provides a rare opportunity for amateur astronomers to directly observe an asteroid with optical telescopes			0
but because the object is so dark , @entity8 said stargazers would need a telescope with an aperture of 6 inches ( 15cm ) or larger to see it			2
" it 's visible across @entity81 in the ensuing hours , dim at 11th or 12th magnitude and moving fast , " @entity79 magazine said			0
@entity0 's @entity83 contributed to this report .			0
