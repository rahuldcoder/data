@entity0 -- with its early colonial portraits , depictions of grand historical battles , transcendentalist landscapes and intimate , turn - of - the - century paintings of the elite classes , the collection of @entity4 art at the @entity5 in @entity6 ranks as one of the finest in the world			1
it also functions as a visual timeline for the events in the nation 's history			0
" it 's @entity4 history through the eyes of @entity4 artists , " said @entity20 , chairman of the @entity21 at the @entity5 of @entity22 " most of the major trends , the events of importance in the nation 's history , were addressed by artists in one way or another -- war , @entity34 , the environment , all of these things , " he said			1
now , the @entity4 wing at the museum has been re-configured for the 21st century and has re-opened to the public following a decade - long renovation program			1
" the display of the art is broadly chronological , " said @entity20 , explaining that the re-designed galleries move from early colonial paintings , onto the @entity45 period , the @entity48 , the @entity34 era and finally to the late - nineteenth century paintings of @entity51 and @entity52			1
@entity53 sets up ' mini-museum ' in @entity56 's @entity55 also on display are collections of @entity4 decorative arts , including furniture , silverware and ceramics			2
" we want to treat these different media as works of art on their own -- it 's an effort to have a broader a view of what constitutes art , " said @entity20			0
but the jewel in the collection , according to @entity20 , is @entity74 's monumental painting @entity75 , which depicts @entity76 crossing an iceberg - strewn river with his troops at a pivotal moment in the revolution			0
" it was a major history painting , @entity74 had done a series of history paintings that documented and touched on the evolution of the @entity4 as a democratic society , " said curator at the @entity83			1
@entity74 grew up in @entity4 but subsequently moved back to his native @entity89 , where he painted @entity75 in 1851			2
" the intention was really to fuel the quest for freedom in @entity93 and @entity89 by looking back in time to this great hero of the @entity95 , creating this kind of mythic historical scene , an event that was a turning point in the revolution , " said @entity83			1
it was later taken to @entity4 and served as a focal point during the @entity34 , @entity83 said , and has fallen in and out of public favor ever since			2
now it takes pride of place in the new galleries			0
also on display following a recent acquisition -- obtained just three days before the new wing opened in january -- is a sculpture of @entity111 by @entity112 , a reduction of the one that stands in @entity115 in @entity116			1
" this is particularly exciting for us because it was originally in the collection of @entity122 and @entity122 was @entity111 's private secretary during the @entity34 , " said curator @entity117			1
@entity124 's riches travel to @entity6 's @entity5 the sculpture portrays @entity111 deep in thought and looking , according to @entity117 , " as if the weight of the world is on his shoulders			1
" though the works in the collection are arranged chronologically , themes emerge throughout -- notably the importance of the environment			0
@entity83 describes a painting by @entity136 , founder of the landscape - oriented , mid- 19th - century @entity48 , depicting a tourist attraction on the @entity139			0
" he 's portrayed settled land on the right and wilderness on the left and it 's essentially his manifesto to preserve the wilderness , to not lose sight of the beauty and spiritual importance of the wilderness as we rush to settle the land , " said @entity83			0
" it 's almost like the beginning of the environmental movement , portrayed in this painting , " she continued			0
this also comes through in the 1918 bronze sculpture " @entity165 , " by @entity159 , which portrays a @entity161 sat slumped on his exhausted horse and which functions as a metaphor , according to @entity117 , " for the effect of @entity168 settlement on the @entity169			2
" what also emerges throughout the collection is the enduring influence of @entity93 styles in @entity4 art. through the works , said @entity176 , you can see " an interesting blend of @entity93 sophistication and aesthetics with @entity4 subjects			1
" this carries through from the early colonial portraits by @entity185 artists , which influenced @entity4 painters such as @entity188 , all the way through to @entity190 @entity51			0
" what is @entity4 art ? " said @entity20			2
" well , it 's somewhat in the eye of the beholder			0
