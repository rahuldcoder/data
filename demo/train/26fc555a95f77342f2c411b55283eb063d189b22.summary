-- @entity1 put @entity2 on course for a spot in the @entity6 quarterfinals with a late winner in a topsy - turvy 3 - 2 @entity9 victory over @entity10			1
@entity10 bossed the first half and went ahead inside 10 minutes through @entity12			2
a terrible mistake from @entity10 keeper @entity14 allowed @entity15 to equalise and @entity16 gave @entity2 the lead in the 72nd minute			1
@entity18 thought he had earned a point with an 82nd - minute penalty but @entity1 had the last word for @entity2 just four minutes later			1
the @entity2 were looking to ignite their campaign after a shock 1 - 0 defeat by @entity25 in their opening match , which was also a first loss for manager @entity27			1
but it got worse for the four - time champions in only the eighth minute , and it was experienced center - back @entity30 who was the architect of his own side 's downfall			0
@entity34 swung in a great cross from the left and , in attempting to head behind , @entity30 instead drew a point - blank save from his keeper			0
@entity39 , though , could only push the ball out to @entity12 , who was left with a simple tap - in			0
@entity10 should have doubled their lead before half - time			1
@entity44 's fierce free - kick was pushed back into the danger area by @entity39 but @entity18 could not direct his shot away from the keeper			0
and that was made to look very costly in the 68th minute when a calamitous mistake from @entity14 saw @entity2 draw level			2
@entity15 sent in a hopeful cross from the right wing that the @entity10 keeper inexplicably helped into his own net			2
and the turnaround was complete four minutes later thanks to @entity16			0
with @entity10 appealing for handball , the striker collected @entity59 's cross and fired into the far corner			0
but @entity39 handed @entity10 a way back into the match with his own rash bit of goalkeeping , scything down @entity12 on the left edge of his penalty area to concede an 82nd - minute spot - kick , which was coolly dispatched by @entity18			1
there was another twist to come , though			0
four minutes later , @entity15 swung in a free - kick from near the halfway line and @entity1 rose above the defence to power his header into the bottom corner			2
meanwhile , @entity25 added a 0 - 0 draw with @entity76 to their opening win against @entity2 as they put themselves within touching distance of the last eight			1
there was little between the two sides at the @entity87 do @entity83 and a draw was a fair result .			0

@entity1 put @entity2 on course for a last eight spot in the @entity6
he scores a late winner in a topsy - turvy 3 - 2 @entity9 success over @entity10 on *sunday*
meanwhile , in the other group match , @entity25 and @entity76 played out a dull 0 - 0 draw
