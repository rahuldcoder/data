-- @entity2 may not be the best - known player in the car rental industry , but it 's best in class for many travelers , a new survey finds			1
the @entity9 - based company was tops in the @entity11 2011 @entity12 , released tuesday			0
@entity2 received particularly high marks for its prices and shuttle service			1
@entity16 was in second place , performing especially well among leisure travelers			0
@entity19 ranked third in the study			0
the survey measures satisfaction with car rental companies in six categories : costs and fees , the pickup process , the return process , the rental car itself , the company 's shuttle bus or van , and the reservation process			1
travelers ' overall happiness with rental car companies increased for a second consecutive year , the study found			1
" as positive as this increase in satisfaction is , there remains ample opportunity for rental car companies to further delight their customers in the future , " said @entity39 , a vice president at @entity11			1
those improvements could include companies digitally measuring gas tank levels for more accurate charges , retrieving mileage and gas information digitally as customers return cars , and giving real - time estimates of shuttle van arrival times , he said			2
meanwhile , a big issue continues to be the amount of time it takes customers to pick up their cars			0
the average wait time now is 17 minutes , the study found			1
that 's an improvement from 20.5 minutes in 2010 but still way too long for many people			1
satisfaction drops considerably among travelers who have to wait more than five minutes to get their car			2
" the culture of immediacy creates expectations around timeliness of service that can be challenging to meet , " said @entity69 of @entity11			0
the company advised travelers to use kiosks -- if available -- instead of waiting in line at the counter			0
very few rental car customers now use kiosks , but those who do tend to be more satisfied with the experience overall , @entity11 said			2
the 2011 @entity12 is based on more than 12,500 evaluations from business and leisure travelers who rented a car at an airport location			0
the survey was conducted between january and september .			0
