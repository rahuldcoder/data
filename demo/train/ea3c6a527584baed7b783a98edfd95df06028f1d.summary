-- the @entity2 mining disaster is already the deadliest industrial catastrophe in @entity5 's history			1
yet @entity6 are unable to grieve for the appalling loss of human life			2
@entity10 shock and fury are the overriding public sentiments against the brazen lack of humility and sense of responsibility displayed by those in positions of power , both in the government and private sector			1
but prime minister @entity23 's scandalous attempt to justify the death of more than 280 miners by pointing to mining disasters that occurred in @entity27 , @entity28 and the @entity29 more than a century ago reveals more than the worldview of a ruthless politician with a skewed sense of chronology			1
it also exposes @entity5 for what it has become : a grim 21st - century @entity38 dystopia , where a new class of political and business elite grows rich and powerful on the back of cheap labor and expendable lives			1
the comparison with 19th century @entity45 is hardly superfluous : worker 's rights have been systematically weakened and are routinely violated in @entity5 since the 1980s , to the extent that the country was " blacklisted " by the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) in 2008			1
trade unions , once powerful and influential , have been emasculated and seen their ranks dwindle			0
over a million subcontracted workers in the public and private sector are without job security , deprived of their right to join unions and participate in collective bargaining			0
cheap labor and weak regulation make @entity5 an attractive destination for industrial production and fuel the country 's construction sector , which has been driving growth over the past decade			1
yet they also come with a terrible price tag : the @entity50 ranked @entity5 first in @entity45 and third in the world for fatal work accidents in 2012			1
coal mining is among the deadliest of professions			0
according to a 2010 report by the @entity6 think tank @entity78 , the ratio of deaths to production capacity in @entity5 was five times the figure for @entity80 and 361 times the figure for the @entity29 , two of the world 's leading coal producers			1
an overwhelming majority of the work related deaths are caused by poor working conditions , inadequate training and a general lack of job security , and are thus preventable			2
" dying , " he declared following an explosion that killed 30 workers at a @entity95 mine in 2010 , " is the fate of the miner			0
" in @entity2 , he casually suggested that accidents were in the nature of this work ; they were " usual things			2
" as he spoke , his normally animated face remained calm and expressionless , devoid of any visible sign of remorse or empathy			0
he accepted no responsibility , including for his party 's rejection of a parliamentary proposal by the opposition @entity109 only three weeks ago to investigate a string of past accidents and deaths at the very mining facility in @entity2			1
it would appear that @entity23 views such " accidents " as unfortunate but unavoidable side effects of @entity5 's rise as a regional power under his leadership			1
after all , no empire is built without the blood and sacrifice of the nation , whose " will " he claims to embody and grandeur he seeks to restore			0
as in @entity28 and @entity27 at the turn of the last century , tales of imperial glory constitute a central part of the ruling @entity131 's populist discourse			2
and in a country that is deeply divided along identity issues , especially along the secular versus religious fault line , such discourse has powerful appeal			0
but even @entity23 can not sustain his tremendous popularity through nationalist propaganda and perpetuated feelings of social resentment , if he and his aides continue to dismiss the plight of " his people " and respond to their ultimate sacrifice with kicks and punches			1
in this regard , the @entity2 disaster may turn out to be a watershed moment			2
numerous times in recent years , the government 's security apparatus harassed those who were experiencing unspeakable agony for having lost loved ones , some at the state 's own hands			0
the families of those killed in an airstrike near the @entity166 village of @entity167 in december 2011 , in the terror attack in @entity169 in may 2013 , or during the anti-government protests across the country since last june have been deprived of their right to grieve and forced into a continuous state shock and outrage			0
but these were mostly poor @entity166 , @entity175 or secular @entity6 , who are unlikely to support @entity23 's party			2
in @entity2 , on the other hand , the @entity131 is popular			0
it carried the town comfortably both in the general election in 2011 and the municipal election held in march this year			0
and it is here that the @entity131 's headquarters have been ransacked , and the prime minister hackled and called on to resign by furious residents			0
in @entity186 's @entity185 , " soma " was the hallucinogenic substance used by the state to induce a feeling of contentment and happiness among citizens			0
it remains to be seen whether in @entity23 's @entity5 , @entity2 will have the opposite effect .			1
