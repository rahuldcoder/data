-- as " @entity3 " has developed over the past five seasons , the series has expanded from the story of the people -- and vampires -- living in the small town of @entity8 , @entity9 , to a sprawling , multinarrative saga about how supernatural beings can exist in the modern world			1
season six premieres on june 16 with the show 's first episodes since the departure of creator and showrunner @entity19			1
new showrunner @entity20 will immediately bring fans back into the action from season five 's tumultuous finale and , eventually , back to where the series all began			1
" there 's a real energy and excitement , and i think that came this year from the top down , " said @entity27 , who stars as werewolf @entity28			1
" the show got really big in its scope during seasons three , four and five , and it became more about the world and these creatures with so many plot lines			1
in season six , there 's a concerted effort to make this show return to what made it great in season one and two			1
it was about these people who lived in a town			1
it was about the town versus the rest of the world			2
i think ( the show ) really returns to that at the end of this season			1
the way that it 's pulled is really smart , and i think it 's going to be really fun for the audience			2
" when last season came to a close , the governing @entity61 was under attack , the @entity60 factories had been destroyed , and vampire @entity65 ( @entity66 ) had transformed into all - powerful god figure by drinking the blood of @entity69			1
meanwhile , @entity28 had become the werewolves ' packmaster , and @entity72 ( @entity73 ) was being pursued by an ancient and mysterious vampire named @entity75			2
the season 's premiere episode , " @entity78 , really ? " quickly draws the action forward to reveal just how much is at stake for the vampires , the humans and everyone in between			1
" the tone is pretty dark this season , " said @entity84 , whose character , @entity86 , became a vampire last season and left viewers with a glimpse of a possible relationship between her and her maker , @entity94 ( @entity93 ) , in the finale			1
" i think the ads that they 're putting out right now say it best : no one is safe this season			1
there 's definitely a war going on			2
the vampires have to fight that war , ( and ) the humans have to fight that war -- so it 's like survival of the fittest			2
" various new characters emerge in the picture as it becomes clear that a conflict is brewing against the vampires -- and possibly the werewolves and shape - shifters as well			2
@entity9 gov. @entity118 , played by new cast member @entity119 , leads the crusade against the supernatural while @entity122 , played by @entity123 , appears as a pro-vampire activist			1
meanwhile , @entity72 's faerie grandfather @entity125 ( @entity125 ) materializes to help his granddaughter seek out @entity75			2
" we always have these amazing new characters played by unbelievable actors , " @entity127 said			2
" we have guest stars like @entity125			2
that , for us , is really lovely			2
i just remember being in scenes with @entity136 ( in past seasons ) and thinking , ' this must be what it 's like to play tennis with ( @entity142 ) @entity141			0
' you just rise to the occasion			0
you just want to bring your best game when you 're with someone like @entity125			0
" " how @entity75 is going to be introduced is rather amazing , " @entity147 added			0
" you 're not gon na see it coming , i think			0
it takes a minute to figure out who @entity75 is , because he is introduced , but he 's not introduced as @entity75			0
the guy who 's playing him is an amazing actor , so it 's going to be really nice			0
" on the relationship front , @entity72 has seemingly exhausted her obsession with vampires @entity65 and @entity158 ( @entity159 ¥ rd ) and will meet a new love interest played by @entity161 , who may also be supernatural			0
@entity28 , who @entity27 says is learning that the benefits of being packmaster include his choice of women , may not totally be out of the picture , though			0
" it was about to go down , and she threw up on his shoes , so i think there 's a lot left on the table still , " @entity27 said of @entity72 's relationship with his character			0
" they have n't even gone there yet , come on ! i think the door is definitely still open			1
" for @entity127 , the possibility of a romance between @entity94 and @entity86 is compelling , mostly because the two characters have hated each other over the course of the past few seasons			0
although the actress wo n't confirm whether the two vampires will end up in a relationship , van @entity93 is interested in how these two characters interact on the show			1
" what 's fascinating to me is that after six years , it starts to seem normal and make sense , " @entity127 said			0
" they 're both very strong women who have been through some very hard times , and they 're not victims , they 're survivors			0
so we have this interesting chemistry			0
i just started wondering as the season was being filmed last year when it would happen			1
" but the biggest mystery awaiting fans of the series this season is the question " who will die ? " rumors that season six will feature the death of a major character have flown for months , leading to extensive online speculation and a looming sense of dread			1
according to the actors , there is truth to the rumors			0
" that 's true , " @entity27 confirmed			0
" but i 'm not going to say who			0
i can say that that 's true , but that 's about it			0
" on a less morbid note , the show is still replete with nudity and sex scenes , some involving several characters			1
@entity27 , who regularly bares all for the series and appeared as a stripper in last year 's " @entity228 , " just sees it as part of job after several seasons			0
" i 'm as naked as i ever am ( this season ) , " @entity27 admitted			1
" there 's always all these questions before your first nude scene , but even my first nude scene on ' @entity3 ' was n't my first nude scene ever			1
i did a play during college in an off - @entity242 theater where i was full - frontal , and i did another show in college where i emerged onstage naked as well , so i think once you get over it in front of a crowd of live , paying customers or your classmates , it 's like , whatever			1
it 's not that big of a deal			0
i think it 's probably a lot of the motivation behind why i work out so hard			0
it 's at least a part of it ! "			0
