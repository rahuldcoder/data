@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's @entity5 has ruled @entity6 the winner of a november 7 presidential runoff election , the court 's president announced friday in the country 's capital city			1
the ruling wraps up a two - year transition to civilian rule after a military junta took power in december 2008			0
provisional results that had been released by the west @entity19 country 's electoral commission on november 15 put @entity20 ahead of his rival , @entity23 , with 52.5 percent of the vote			2
the @entity5 took two weeks deliberating fraud charges from both sides before upholding the provisional results of what has been viewed as @entity1 's most democratic and transparent election in its 52 - year history			1
" mister @entity6 , having obtained 52.52 percent of ballots cast , is elected @entity35 of @entity1 , " @entity31 , president of the @entity5 announced to reporters at the @entity5 office in @entity0 shortly after midnight			1
upon announcement , representatives from @entity6 's party rejoiced and cheered their victory but expressed their desire to repair the damages of a polarizing campaign marred by violence and intimidation			0
" we ask all @entity1 to lend a hand so that together ... we can participate in the moral , physical , institutional and political reconstruction of our country , " @entity45 , @entity20 's campaign director told reporters			2
@entity23 , who had previously rejected the results -- alleging the election was riddled with fraud that prevented his victory -- took on a more conciliatory tone after the verdict			2
" since the @entity5 decision allows for no appeals , we can only accept the verdict given by the highest judiciary institution of the republic , " @entity23 told reporters at his home on friday			1
the provisional results were met by riots and violence around the country			0
the prime minister subsequently declared a national state of emergency to deal with the violence			0
analysts are worried about the potential of violence in @entity1 spreading to neighboring @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 , all of which are recovering from civil wars			1
fighting broke out in the eastern @entity74 town of @entity82 between @entity83 and @entity84 after the @entity1 election results were announced			2
" @entity74 and @entity1 are only divided by what you call colonial boundaries between us			0
most of the major ethnic tribes here you find in @entity74 also , " @entity90 , ambassador of @entity74 to @entity1 told @entity2 recently , adding that ethnic tensions can easily spread across porous borders			0
the court decision on the election -- which was deemed " credible and transparent " by @entity98 representatives -- surprised few in @entity1 's sprawling seaside capital			1
the new president -- a 72 - year old former lecturer at @entity101 in @entity102 -- will face immense challenges ranging from creating employment to reforming the notoriously corrupt and abusive army in a country sharply divided along ethnic lines .			0
