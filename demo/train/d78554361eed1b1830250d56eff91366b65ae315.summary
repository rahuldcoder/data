-- a sailor has described her " miraculous " escape after a whale leapt out of the water and crash - landed on the deck of her boat off the coast of @entity9			1
@entity10 , 50 , of the @entity11 , and her partner @entity12 had been watching the whale from a distance in @entity15 , near @entity17 harbor , when it moved toward their 10 - meter vessel and breached 20 meters away			2
southern right whales are a common sight in @entity17 waters during the breeding season from june to november , drawing whale watchers to the region			1
@entity27 said the couple -- both experienced sailors -- expected the creature to go under the boat before re-emerging on the other side			2
" i looked around and i saw this huge whale coming out of the water and smashing against the side of the boat , " @entity27 told @entity0			0
" the whale slipped back into the water but we just saw the mast with all its rigging and everything flying towards us , and that was scary , actually			2
" @entity27 said @entity44 ducked behind the steering wheel which bore the impact of the mast			0
and while the masts need replacing , @entity27 said the steel structure of the boat was undamaged			0
" miraculously nothing happened to us , " she added			0
a tourist on a nearby boat captured the moment when the whale breached out of the water on camera			0
@entity27 said she had spoken to a local marine mammal expert who had told her that the incident was a " freak accident			1
" because the couple had been sailing without the engine on , the whale had failed to hear them , she said			1
" it was a young southern right whale and he was just having fun			0
they have very poor eyesight and obviously if they 're breaching visibility is very poor			1
the whale did not intend to attack us , it just did not hear us			0
" whale experts have taken dna samples from blubber left on the deck to see whether they have any existing records on the animal			0
@entity27 said the whale appeared to be unhurt by the experience : " we saw it afterwards and there was no blood or anything			1
i think for a whale it was just a scratch and a bump			2
" in future , the couple would make sure they had the engine on while sailing during whale season , she added			1
" we were just going out sailing because it was an awesome day			0
obviously it 's a bonus if you see a whale but we did n't quite count on having one on top of the boat			1
