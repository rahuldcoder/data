@entity0 -- a @entity3 citizen has been arrested in the @entity6 bombing probe , @entity3 attorney general @entity2 announced early tuesday			1
@entity7 was arrested at @entity8 in @entity0 as he prepared to board a flight to @entity10 , @entity2 said			1
" it is clear the intent behind this terrorist act was to kill @entity3 , " @entity2 said			2
" we will not rest until we bring everyone responsible to justice			2
" law enforcement officials said the suspect is the person who bought the @entity19 used in the bombing attempt			1
earlier , a law enforcement official said the buyer is a naturalized @entity3 citizen from @entity24 , and that investigators are looking at more than one person in connection with the unsuccessful bombing			1
@entity1 has learned that the @entity29 investigating the bombing attempt is considering the possibility that the attempt involved more than just a " lone wolf			1
" according to a source familiar with the investigation , investigators believe the plan was an intended terrorist attack to set off explosives in the heart of @entity41 on saturday night , but the individuals did n't have the expertise to detonate their device			2
the @entity19 had been sold three weeks ago in a cash deal with no paperwork exchanged , a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told @entity1 earlier monday			1
the $ 1,800 deal was closed at a @entity52 shopping mall , where the buyer handed over the money and drove off , the source said			0
the seller described the buyer as a man in his late 20s to early 30s , and investigators are checking into phone records between the two , the source said			0
a bomb made up of propane tanks , fertilizer and gasoline failed to detonate inside the suv			1
@entity0 police commissioner @entity66 said the device could have produced " a significant fireball " in the heart of @entity41 on saturday night had it detonated properly			1
earlier , authorities said they were searching for two people they wanted to question in connection with the would - be bomb			1
a video obtained from a tourist in the area shows a person apparently running north on @entity78 , while another video shows a balding man with dark hair removing a shirt and putting it in a bag before walking out of view of the camera , which was inside a restaurant			1
" these are not suspects , " @entity66 said			0
" these are people we would like to speak to			0
" the question of who was behind the failed bomb attempt was the subject of intense scrutiny monday			1
@entity3 attorney general @entity2 said investigators have some " good leads , " but he declined to elaborate			0
and @entity66 said it was " too early to say " whether the attempt was carried out by a lone wolf , international terrorists , or any other type of network			1
@entity24 @entity105 leader @entity104 appeared on a video released less than 24 hours after the attempt , claiming @entity105 fighters were prepared to inflict " extremely painful blows " in major @entity3 cities			1
but a senior @entity3 military official said there was no " credible evidence " at the early stages of the investigation that the @entity24 @entity105 was responsible for the @entity6 bomb incident			1
and one counterintelligence official told @entity1 there was no evidence of any communications among terrorist organizations overseas about the device after saturday night 's attempt			2
" people overseas were not giving high fives ... or saying anything about the bomb not working , " the official said			2
" there is no indication that there was that kind of tie			0
" another @entity3 official with direct awareness of the latest @entity3 understanding of the incident said the @entity24 group has never shown " trans - national capabilities " like other groups , such as @entity140			0
but such a possibility is " not something one can rule out at this early stage , " said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the information			0
but @entity24 's @entity105 movement has been linked to a 2008 plot to blow up subway stations in the @entity150 city of @entity155 , and at least two of the 11 men convicted in the plot came to @entity155 from @entity24 , @entity150 prosecutors said			2
and @entity159 , a former agent with the @entity3 @entity160 , said the bomber could have been " internationally inspired , " but the device showed little sign that a group like @entity140 was behind it			0
" their bombs would be better funded , better fused , better materials , better knowledge , " he said			0
the device inside the @entity19 was made up of propane tanks , gasoline and fertilizer that turned out to be of a non-explosive grade , along with a metal pot containing wiring and firecrackers			0
more firecrackers were found in a can on the back seat of the vehicle , sandwiched between two full , five - gallon gasoline cans and connected by wires to clocks			0
@entity159 called the bomb " a @entity186 contraption " that would have been difficult to set off			2
" that does not mean that the bomb 's not deadly , " he said			2
someone close by could be hurt or killed			0
" but it 's not a very reliable working system , a fusing and firing system , at all , " he told @entity1			0
@entity192 , a former @entity0 bomb squad member , said the device had " no known signature " -- a style of construction that might link it to known terrorist groups			1
that suggests it was the work of either an individual or a new organization , said @entity192 , who is now an adviser to the @entity203			0
@entity192 said the detonating mechanism lacked the energy needed to properly set off the explosion			0
@entity0 police have been examining the device for clues such as fingerprints , hair and fibers since saturday			1
the vehicle and bomb components were taken to the @entity214 's forensic laboratory in @entity218 , @entity219 , on monday , @entity214 spokesman @entity213 said monday evening			2
@entity1 's @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225 contributed to this report .			0
