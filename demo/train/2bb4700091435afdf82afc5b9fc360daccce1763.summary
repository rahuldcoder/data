-- the @entity1 found leading computer chipmaker @entity3 guilty wednesday of violating @entity5 anti-trust rules and ordered that it pay a fine of 1.06 billion euros ( $ 1.45 billion )			1
@entity3 was allowed to present a defense to the @entity1 ahead of tuesday 's ruling it is the largest fine the commission has ever imposed , said @entity11 , the @entity5 commissioner for competition			1
@entity3 has said it plans to appeal the decision			1
the commission found @entity3 abused its dominant market position in the market for computer chips known as the x86 computer processing unit ( cpu ) , @entity11 said			1
the abuse lasted more than five years , she said			0
" those x86 chips are the engine of the car , so to say , " @entity11 said at a news conference in @entity22 , @entity23			0
" your computer wo n't work without these chips			0
" @entity3 held a 70 percent share of the market during the period of the violations , she said			1
" that @entity3 had such a large market share is not a problem in itself , " @entity11 said			1
" what is a problem is that @entity3 abused its dominant position			1
specifically , @entity3 used illegal anti-competitive practices to exclude essentially its only competitor , and that reduced consumer choice -- and the whole story is about consumers			2
" @entity3 's actions frustrated innovation and reduced consumer welfare , @entity11 said			2
the commission found that @entity3 awarded major computer manufacturers rebates on the condition that they purchase all or most of their supplies from @entity3			1
@entity3 also paid @entity5 's biggest computer retailer , @entity56 , to sell @entity3 - based pcs exclusively , the commission found			2
@entity56 has some 200 megastores in nine countries			0
the commission also found that @entity3 awarded payments to computer manufacturers so they would postpone or cancel the launch of products containing parts from its leading competitor , @entity67			2
" the commission found that these payments had the potential effect of preventing products for which there was a consumer demand from coming to the market , " the commission said in a statement			0
" given that @entity3 has harmed millions and millions of @entity5 consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for more than five years , the size of the fine should come as no surprise , " @entity11 said			1
@entity3 was allowed to present a defense to the commission 's preliminary conclusions			2
but @entity11 said the company " went to great lengths " to cover up its anti-competitive practices , resulting in a long and complex investigation			0
in a statement on the company web site , @entity92 , @entity3 's president and ceo said the company took strong exception to the ruling and planned to appeal			1
" we believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace -- characterized by constant innovation , improved product performance and lower prices , " @entity92 said			0
" there has been absolutely zero harm to consumers			0
he added that the compnay did not believe its practices violated @entity5 law and accused the @entity112 for @entity113 of ignoring or refusing to " obtain significant evidence that contradicts the assertions in this decision			0
" @entity92 added that the company had never sold products below cost but had invested in innovation , manufacturing and developing leadership technology with the result that it could " discount our products to compete in a highly competitive marketplace			0
" " despite our strongly held views , " @entity92 concluded , " as we go through the appeals process we plan to work with the @entity1 to ensure we 're in compliance with their decision			0
