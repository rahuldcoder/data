-- photo - sharing app @entity1 has attracted more than 100 million users by encouraging people to snap pictures with their smartphones , dress them up with filters and share them with friends			1
in the two years since @entity1 launched , it 's been a mobile - only network for an increasingly mobile society			2
now that 's about to change			0
@entity1 announced monday it will be adapting user photos and data into web - based profiles for people to enjoy from laptops or desktops			1
each @entity20 profile will feature a selection of recently shared photographs along with the user 's profile photo and bio , offering a quick visual snapshot of someone 's interests and aesthetic			1
" we 're launching web profiles to give you a simple way to share your photos with more people and to make it easier to discover new users on the @entity20 , " @entity1 said in a blog post			1
photos are expandable on the new web pages , meaning your followers will be able to view your prized pics in a larger , 6x6 - inch format instead of peering at those little square images on their phones			2
" it strikes me that a quick , dynamic overview of your life in pictures is maybe even more compelling than the overall @entity50 because it 's so simple			0
everyone understands pictures , " wrote tech columnist and prolific @entity1 user @entity52 on his blog			0
users wo n't be able to upload images to their accounts from the @entity20 , although they can follow others , comment and like photos			2
it 's a big upgrade over @entity1 's traditionally bare - bones website , which has contained little more than a blog and information for app developers			0
the new interface creates a challenge for the ecosystem of independent sites that had sought to fill @entity1 's web void by offering browser - based platforms for viewing , liking and commenting on photos from the app. they include @entity76 , which gives users a detailed breakdown of data concerning their @entity1 feed , and @entity81 , a more straightforward photo viewing site			1
@entity1 says its web profiles will launch for all users in the next week or so			1
" if you ca n't see your profile yet , rest assured that you 'll see it in the next few days , " the company says			0
@entity1 also says that if your photos are set to private , they will be visible on the web only to @entity1 users you 've allowed to follow you			1
instagram photos show @entity96 's path of damage to see your profile or to explore a friend 's profile , go to @entity100 / [ username ]			0
here 's an example of how it will look			0
