-- the race to the @entity2 is off -- although the trek still continues for @entity4 and teams of wounded veterans			1
@entity7 , the expedition director of the @entity8 , revealed saturday that he 'd made the decision to call off the competition among three teams to reach the pole after five days			1
" the reason for this is entirely simple -- safety , which remains the core principal of our expeditions , " @entity7 said in a statement			1
it was n't bad weather that led to the decision , and @entity7 even said that " all three teams were progressing well " over the first five days			2
rather , it was the fact that the mission -- especially as a competition -- was putting undue strain on the participants			2
" it was becoming evident that there was a higher degree of stress imposed on the team members , due to unprecedented terrain on the plateau , " said @entity7 , a former @entity29 soldier who co-founded walking with @entity30 in 2010			0
prince @entity4 -- himself a member of @entity29 's armed forces , having served in @entity41 and elsewhere -- has had a long association with this charity			1
in several ways , he 's been preparing for this latest mission for a long time			0
that includes taking part in a walking with the wounded expedition to the @entity49 -- even plunging into the @entity51 's freezing waters -- in 2011 before withdrawing to attend his brother @entity52 's wedding			0
more recently , he traveled to @entity55 for training and even spent 24 hours in an industrial freezer in preparation for the @entity2 race			2
yet , while @entity4 may be the only royal in @entity60 , he 's hardly the only celebrity			2
@entity63 actor and " @entity64 " star @entity61 is an honorary member of the @entity66 team , while @entity67 , perhaps best known for his role as @entity69 in " the wire , " joins veterans wounded in combat from the @entity74 nations of @entity75 and @entity76			1
still , the stars -- and focus of the event -- are the veterans themselves			0
the three teams of seven participants each represent the @entity29 , @entity66 and the @entity74 , which consists of several countries long affiliated with the @entity29 empire			0
the plan was to trek more than 200 miles ( 322 kilometers ) across the sparse continent , in temperatures as low as -35 degrees @entity88 )			0
and that 's still the plan ; it 's just that they wo n't be racing			1
the participants on sunday are set to resuming the walk , hoping to traverse the 70 remaining miles to the @entity2 " with no stress being placed on the teams ... enabling them all to do this in their own time , " @entity7 explained			1
@entity7 said he expects them all to reach that , by friday or saturday of next week , all of them will be at the finish " celebrating			0
" @entity0 's @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity8 is nixed , its director says
the reason is " safety , " specifically the " stressed imposed " on participants
prince @entity4 , @entity61 participate *alongside* wounded vets
they *'ll* continue to go to the @entity2 , but just wo n't be competing
