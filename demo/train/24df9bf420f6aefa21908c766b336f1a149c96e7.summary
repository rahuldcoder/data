@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 is a 2 - year - old boy full of energy , curiosity and emotions			1
watching him play with his toys , you do n't notice any of the emotional toll that having a parent deploy can take on a little boy			1
let alone having both parents deploy , for nearly seven months simultaneously			1
but that 's what @entity3 's parents did , choosing to deploy to @entity15 together , rather than have one stay home with @entity3 while the other deployed			1
that decision may be hard for some parents to fathom , but for the @entity20 it was the best option			1
" it was very difficult , " @entity22 staff sgt. @entity21 said in an interview from @entity24 , where he and his wife are based			1
" it took a lot of back - and - forth discussions , " @entity27 said			1
part of what made the decision less difficult was @entity3 's age			1
" we were thinking that a 2 - year - old would n't remember too much of us being gone than if we had to do it when he was 7 , when he 'd remember the whole thing , " @entity21 explained			1
still , the day they left was hard for them			0
" it was a very difficult day			1
just wanted to hold him , told him we loved him , and that we 'd be home soon , even though he did n't understand that , " @entity21 said			0
chat could n't put it into words : " i do n't think a mother could ever describe that feeling , leaving your son			0
" the genesis of the idea came from previous deployments , when @entity55 would came back from the war zone and @entity21 had to leave a few weeks later			2
" she deployed to @entity58 in 2004 and then as soon as she came back i deployed to @entity58 in 2005 shortly after			0
it was about two weeks that we got to hang out together			0
it was very hard , because you try to catch up in those two weeks			0
" so when new orders came , they decided they wanted more time together as a couple , and that that meant leaving their 2 - year - old in the @entity69			1
but that difficult decision was made much easier by @entity21 's parents			1
" they asked us if we would be willing to keep @entity3 and of course that was a no - brainer , we said yes , " said @entity72 , @entity3 's grandfather			1
" i 'm just thankful that we 've been able to be there , and spend time with him and see him a lot more than what we would have before , " @entity77 , @entity21 's mother , said			2
" it 's just been a blessing			2
" @entity3 and his parents live in @entity85 , and most of his relatives on his father 's side live in @entity0			1
so for the last seven months he 's gotten to know that side of his family			1
but perhaps the true saving grace for @entity21 is a software application that was n't even around when the war started in @entity15 , the video chatting program @entity97			0
the first time @entity21 deployed to war , he wrote home only a few times			0
now , with high - speed internet connections , he and @entity55 can call home and see @entity103 and he can see them			2
but since he 's just 2 , @entity3 is not the ideal video chatter yet			1
instead of talking to his parents on the computer , he 'll play with balloons or his basketball			2
he even puts the basketball in front of the computer screen with his mother and father on it and ask them to shoot			0
@entity21 said these video chats are important to helping them cope			0
" it 's huge , because no matter how rough your day goes , we get to see our little son ... takes all the worries and everything away , " @entity21 said			2
" it really boosts your morale ... being able to see him grow day by day , and hearing the new words he learned to say and showing you everything he learned			0
" having the ability to communicate so easily with the home front can be a double - edged sword for deployed troops , said @entity133 of the @entity134			2
@entity135 cites her own experience , as the wife of a soldier who deployed to @entity58 but was frustrated when their daughter refused to @entity97 with him , avoiding the sessions			0
" ' why does n't she want to talk with me ? ' " @entity133 recalls her husband asking			0
" it was after a few months that we finally realized that her way of coping with the deployment was out - of - sight , out - of - mind			2
and that by talking to him on the phone , by skyping with him -- it was just a reminder that he was n't there and it was hard on her			0
" technology also means troops ca n't immerse themselves in war , like they used to			0
for some , it means dealing with problems at home that previously would be out of sight , out of mind			0
@entity21 are expected to return to @entity85 on thursday , and that 's when this difficult choice pays off			1
instead of just a couple of weeks together , the @entity3 family will have months and months without much concern that either parent or both will have to head off to war again			2
perhaps the only regrets on that day will be from @entity3 's grandparents			1
" we 're already dreading letting him go back because we 're gon na miss him , so i ca n't imagine how his parents feel , " @entity72 said			0
" it would just be devastating , i think			0
" @entity178 contributed to this report .			0

*enlisted* parents decide to leave 2 - year - old with grandparents
" it was very difficult , " boy 's @entity22 dad says
but after 7 - month *separation* , family to be together again
