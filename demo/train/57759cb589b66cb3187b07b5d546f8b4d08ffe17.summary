, you could go down to the local record shop and plunk down your paper - route money for little disks of plastic that were embedded with the latest sounds of your favorite musical performers			0
a self - admitted tech geek , @entity10 is president of @entity13 , a blogging network			1
whether your tastes ran from @entity16 to " @entity17 , you could be assured that those purchased disks were yours -- for keeps			0
you could play ' em over and over until they were scratched beyond repair , you could lend ' em to friends , you could amplify ' em at illicit @entity24 dancing parties , you could sell ' em to used record stores or you could store ' em away in a safe deposit box in hopes they 'd gain value as collector 's items			1
you could even make precious mix tapes for your soda - sharing sweetheart with songs copied from ' em , though this made recording industry executives more than a little nervous			0
and it was n't long before their weaselly whimpers of protest began			2
as the digital age arrived to usher in more perfect ways to copy and distribute ( aka " pirate " ) what these executives saw as their property , those whimpers turned to howls			2
they 've only grown louder since			0
so the recording industry has had a good gig going			0
it 's easy to see why its upper crust is miffed at lowly hoi polloi tampering with its bread and butter ( or pizza			2
whatever crust suits your fancy )			0
one can imagine some mad scientist under the employ of said recording industry locked away in an underground bunker somewhere cooking up a scheme so dark , so evil , that its repercussions would completely remap the way media would be controlled -- with consumers being suckered into paying much , much more for much , much less			2
this scheme would come to be known as @entity74			1
digital rights management or devious rental misappropriation ? that 's right			1
you see , you do n't really buy music for keeps anymore			1
i mean , how can you when this is the sort of thing that can happen ? it 's a bit like buying your dream car , driving it around for a while , then being told it 's got to be given back to the factory because the dealership where it was purchased no longer has a legal association with the factory			1
sorry if you thought you could drive it around until it was worn out beyond repair , if you thought you could lend it to your friends , if you thought you could drive it to the illicit @entity24 dancing party , if you thought you could sell it to a used car dealer or if you thought you could store it under a tarp in your garage for the next couple of decades in hopes it would gain value as a collector 's item			0
being used to the old , tangible business model , you were under the impression that you 'd actually bought something			0
no one told you that you were merely borrowing someone else 's property for a while ( and paying for the privilege to do so )			2
and most people do feel like suckers when @entity74 locks them out of something that they feel they have every right to use , often to the point of attempting to circumnavigate this crappy , unfair system by means that might lead to trouble			1
i can only conclude that , like bootleggers at the repealing of @entity141 , viruses and spyware acquired in pursuit of overcoming content restrictions would n't prosper in a @entity74 - free world			1
really , it 's hard to take alarm from @entity74 - happy organizations such as the @entity146 as anything but a double dose of dookie when you find out that 2007 was a record box office year in spite of all the pirates and ne'er - do - wells and whatnot ! who , exactly , is getting plundered ? it 's no wonder blogger @entity157 finds @entity74 to be one of the most offensive digital constructs on the planet			1
it 'll go away or change dramatically			0
let 's hope sooner rather than later			0
( this column was written before @entity166 announced that @entity167 would be , at some point in the future , capable of providing @entity74 - free music throughout its entire library			1
this was pretty big news , considering how many people use @entity167 to manage their music library			0
this is n't to say that the @entity74 - free tracks available at @entity177 or @entity178 are any less valid , but let 's face it : just about everybody who carries an @entity182 or @entity183 also uses @entity167 as the gateway for purchasing music			1
) i subscribe to @entity187 , so i can listen to just about anything from my desktop , and subscriptions are my preferred method of content consumption			2
i have an @entity194 satellite radio subscription , i pay for just about every channel on digital cable and i have been known to purchase hard copies of content in the past ( dvds , cds , 8 - track tapes , etc. ) but drm ? it 's no good			1
i find it very difficult to purchase something outright when i 'm told that i can only play it x times , only on x devices or for @entity209 long			1
that 's counter-intuitive and consumer unfriendly			0
there are certainly exceptions to the rule , but not when the content is a commodity			0
i once found four different versions of the same song on my wife 's system			2
one had been purchased on @entity187 , another on @entity167 , another on @entity223 and the fourth was an @entity224 ! quadruple madness ! i do n't care how good a song is , she does n't need to have four copies of it ( three of which are completely useless without the proper systems in place )			1
the @entity224 ? it 's as perfect as it needs to be , playable on just about anything these days			0
that 's consumer friendly .			0

services that limit when and how you play digital music are ripping off consumers
digital rights management , or @entity74 , means you do n't really own the music you buy
@entity10 : it 's hard to buy a song when i 'm told i can only play it x times , on x devices
@entity10 : i prefer subscription music services like @entity187 or @entity194 satellite radio
