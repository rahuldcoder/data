-- @entity1 has had a big , big , big last couple of weeks : its @entity4 app dropped at the beginning of april , and @entity6 recently acquired the photo - sharing service for a whopping $ 1 billion			1
the result of all this attention ? a flood of new users , swelling @entity1 's user count up to 50 million			1
so what does this mean for the fate of everyone 's favorite photo app ? it 's probably going to get a whole lot more annoying			0
yup , those salad days are about to end , folks			0
that glorious period in which @entity24 - filtered snaps of @entity25 mingled with @entity27 - tinged mountainsides and cats made classic with a dash of 1977 - bred nostalgia			2
the end is nigh , we say ! steel yourself : we 're about to see an influx of photo - happy parents , drunken college kids and , horror of horrors , even more pheromone - crazed teens with accounts entirely dedicated to prepubescent boy bands			1
@entity1 's passionate users wary of @entity6 takeover in preparation for the onslaught , we 're asking you , dear readers , to take stock of your own @entity52 souls			1
dig deep and evaluate how you can help stave off the horror that is blurry shots of food - caked children and one 's sparkly manicure			1
we 're all guilty of @entity57 ( verb : to thoughtlessly snap and share snaps with no regard for our followers ' feelings ) , and while it 's your inalienable right to share and share alike , you can probably agree that at least one in five of the transgressions below should be quashed			0
translation : do n't do these : 1 )			2
myspacing all over the place we get it , @entity1 is supposed to be a photo feed depicting your life and all the many interesting factions of it ( i knit ! i canoe ! i collect severed heads in my freezer ! call the cops ! )			2
a self - snap is , consequently , totally ok once in a while -- especially if you just got a new haircut / tattoo / head for your collection ( seriously , your phone is n't just a camera -- call the cops )			2
however , do n't you have any , i do n't know , friends ? if not , you 're not going to make any pouting into the camera , your mien made even more morose via the @entity90 filter			0
flooding the feed just took 15 photos of your new puppy in various stages of repose ( he 's in a sunbeam ! he just turned over ! he shifted a little out of the sunbeam ! he just turned over again ! ) ? awesome ! we 're glad you 're pleased with your pet - buying prowess ! upload one and save the rest to your phone for personal perusing -- we do n't need a flipbook			1
if you must needs overshare , might we suggest downloading @entity107 ? this @entity109 app allows you to turn all your snaps into a rad animated gif			0
getting overly textual this faux pas is more @entity1 's fault than users ' -- since the app does n't have private messaging , it can be really hard to flirt with -- i mean , carry on a conversation with another user without cluttering up the comments section of a photo			1
luckily for the chattier folks among us , there 's @entity126 , an @entity109 / web app that makes it easy to converse privately with other users			0
once downloaded , please refer to our article about how to hit on people online without being a creeper			0
being a camera cheat guys : the whole point of @entity1 is that it lets anyone with a phone and some vague sense of composition take an awesome photo -- a filter fixes pretty much anything ( even your face ! burn ... )			2
taking a snap with a really good camera and then uploading it to @entity1 is like enrolling in a kindergarten - level finger - painting class and bringing your own oil paints ( and brush )			1
leave us to our delighted muddlings -- we implore you			0
being an easy target for a parody @entity153 account check out @ textinstagram			0

@entity1 is overrun with new users , and @entity157 *columnists* have *advice* on how to use it
dear readers : help stave off the horror that is blurry shots of food - caked children
do n't flood users ' feeds with 15 shots of your new puppy
