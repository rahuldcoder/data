@entity1 , @entity0 -- after a six - year hiatus in which many bands have emerged , such as the @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 , copying their blend of melodic , intelligent songs and cheeky blokeishness , @entity13 return to show them who is best			1
@entity13 frontman @entity15 still exudes the matey bonhomie that made him one of the best - known @entity18 pop stars of the 90s			1
much has changed since the mid- 1990s when the @entity21 boys fought @entity22 in the hyped @entity23			0
singer @entity15 has pursued successful side projects such as @entity27 and the @entity28 , guitarist @entity25 went solo after being axed acrimoniously during the troubled recording of the " @entity31 " album , bassist @entity24 makes cheese on his farm while drummer @entity34 plans to stand for the @entity18 parliament at the next election			1
happily for fans , the band 's two dominant personalities in @entity15 and @entity25 are now reconciled and , in the year 's most anticipated reunion along with @entity42 ' comeback gigs , @entity13 on thursday played the first of two outdoor concerts in @entity1 's @entity45			1
before a massive crowd and a setting sun , @entity13 kick off with their first single , a feedback - drenched " @entity48 " before going straight into " @entity50 , " the disco - inspired anthem to hedonism that propelled them into the big time in 1994			1
@entity15 exudes matey bonhomie , asking , " was that adequate ? " the crowd roars its reply in the affirmative			0
the good - natured banter continues throughout the concert ; he pays tribute to @entity45 's " lakes , speaker 's corner ... other stuff " and more thoughtfully , reminds the crowd that a million people marched there in 2003 in an unsuccessfully effort to prevent the @entity70 war			2
@entity25 seems happy just to be back in the band , doing the job he does best			1
there is a poignant moment when he takes the lead vocals in " @entity76 " while @entity15 watches his songwriting partner admiringly			0
and as with all the greatest concerts , the hits the crowd has paid to hear keep coming : " there 's @entity82 , " a raucous and bouncy " @entity83 " and " @entity84 " on which actor @entity85 takes the jokey vocals			0
the audience responds to all the songs perfectly , even forcing the band into an extended singalong version of " tender			0
" the only disappointment on that song is that the gospel backing singers are drowned out in the mix. as the light fades , a superb light show suits the mood of the songs perfectly			0
and despite this being a huge concert , there is room for more subtle songs like " out of @entity105 , " a nostalgic " @entity106 " and " this is a @entity107			0
" @entity13 finish with " for tomorrow " and " the @entity108 , " ending what , for this reporter , will be remembered as one of the most amazing concerts			2
what @entity13 fans hope for now is some new material to match the classics they are evidently so proud of .			2
