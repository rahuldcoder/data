" in december 2010 , @entity1 fell ill with the flu			2
the @entity31 were visiting family in @entity33 , so his mom took @entity1 to an urgent care clinic			2
a blood test revealed his platelet count was low			0
probably nothing to worry about , the doctors told @entity39			0
just follow up on it when you get home			0

" @entity11 is an inherited blood disorder that affects about 1 in every 130,000 people , says dr. @entity53 , a pediatric hematologist oncologist at @entity54			1
patients with @entity11 ca n't repair their dna			2

a bone marrow transplant will buy @entity1 more time , but it 's not a cure			1
and the procedure itself is dangerous , requiring up to a year of recovery			0
" @entity101 is n't really on our side , or anybody 's side , with this disease , " @entity39 says			0
the prognosis for @entity11 patients is difficult to predict , @entity53 says			1

to date , @entity118 has given more than $ 1.5 million to @entity53 's program			0
donations stream in from all over the country			0
most are in $ 100 or $ 200 amounts from fans who hear about @entity1 and want to help			2
but the donation @entity39 remembers best came from former @entity14 player @entity146 , who gave $ 5 the night the foundation 's @entity148 account was set up			2
" five dollars to him was a lot of money because those players rely on their program money heavily , " she says			0
" it touched my heart			0
" the @entity14 players have been " unbelievable , " @entity13 says			1
they 've all signed up for the bone marrow donor registry			1
several have already donated bone marrow to help another child in need			1
and they 're great with @entity1 , who is doing his best to live life as a normal kid			2
his parents have told him about his @entity11 , but have n't explained the seriousness of the disease			2
" he 's very aware that all of these people have come together and are trying to help , " @entity39 says			2
" he has the rest of his life to worry			0
" through the foundation , the @entity31 have met other families who 've been through similar struggles			0
a 15 - year - old who has n't yet gone into bone marrow failure gave @entity39 hope that @entity1 could hold out a few more years			1
