in the midst of a disheartening outbreak of measles and assorted other diseases we thought had been wiped out , comes another outbreak that has just gotten started : a @entity7 pander war			1
and those parents who have apparently decided it is in their childrens ' interests to forego vaccines are now smack in the middle of it , and with good reason : outbreaks of the measles and whooping cough are back , endangering the youngest populations everywhere			1
but somehow a clear issue of public health has morphed into a political debate over liberty , personal freedom and individual choice			1
we all understand the past debates over a possible link ( now thoroughly disproven ) between vaccinations and autism , and no one can challenge parents ' rights to try to protect their children			1
but the science is now clear : vaccinations are necessary			1
what 's murky is the politics			1
the growing anti-government animus in the country and a complete lack of trust in institutions has somehow devolved into paranoia -- that the big government - elite - corporate ideological agenda is driving the push for vaccinations			1
whether it 's the skeptical left or the skeptical right , it comes down to the same theory of everything : a deep - seated mistrust in institutions and an unwillingness to defer to them			1
so maybe it should come as no surprise that libertarian sen. @entity57 , while pointing out he 's not " anti-vaccine , " called it a " personal decision			2
" or that @entity61 gov. @entity60 , looking to burnish his conservative credentials , allowed that parents " need to have some measure of choice " about vaccinating their kids ( although he later tried to soften that statement by adding there 's " no question " kids should be vaccinated against measles )			1
is this the same @entity60 who , going against the advice of experts , required a mandatory quarantine of a woman returning from @entity76 who had been fighting @entity77 to keep the public healthy ? hard to square that circle			1
in many ways , says @entity83 , who was domestic policy adviser to former president @entity85 , " vaccines have become the black helicopter of medicine			2
people think that those in positions of institutional authority are either self - aggrandizing or possessed of some ideological mission			2
" that 's precisely why it 's so difficult to lead in this country right now			2
and precisely why the country is in such need of real leaders -- maybe even someone who comes out and says there oughta be a law			2
even president @entity100 's spokesman says the president " believes it should n't require a law for people to exercise common sense and do the right thing			0
" maybe it should n't , but when children who visit @entity109 are getting sick , something is very wrong			0
maybe that 's why conservative pediatric neurosurgeon dr. @entity111 is for mandatory vaccines			0
or why @entity114 sen. @entity113 is rethinking a mandate , as he told @entity5 's @entity116			0
" i 've pulled up short of a federal mandate ... but i am really distressed by some of these comments of wannabe presidential candidates ... , " says @entity113			0
" think of an analogy : what if i said ' it 's my car , i do n't want any brakes ... and it just endangered my life ? [ but ] you 're endangering the lives of other drivers			0
that 's what this is about			0
" and for those zealous small - government types , consider this : even in the most ardent libertarian circles , there 's a classic theory that " the right to swing my fist ends where the other man 's nose begins			0
" it 's a pretty standard argument that makes sense			0
unless , apparently , you are running for political office .			0
