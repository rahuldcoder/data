-- based on @entity3 's serious expression and @entity5 ' focused stare , it was clear the pressure was on			2
it was the summer of 1972 , and the @entity8 were on their @entity10 concert tour for their acclaimed " @entity12 " album			1
but when they were not onstage and rocking out with their fans , they were hard at work remixing tracks at the @entity20 studio in @entity21			0
it was a heady time filled with parties and recording sessions and only one person was there to capture it all intimately -- famed music photographer @entity28 , who was covering the tour for @entity30			1
now the estate of @entity28 is releasing some of the never - before - seen photos of the band in a new book " @entity8 1972 " ( @entity35 ) , out on august 15			1
there will also be a show at @entity39 's @entity38 from july 5 to september 8 , and an exhibit at @entity41 in @entity42 , opening on july 14			1
some of these frames are being displayed exclusively on the @entity45 blog			1
the release could n't have had better timing as the @entity8 recently announced plans to mark their 50th anniversary this year			2
@entity50 , a photographer who worked as @entity28 's assistant , is the sole owner of @entity52			1
( @entity28 died in 2010			2
) working with @entity28 to archive his work allowed her to listen to @entity28 's many stories and delve into his memories			1
@entity57 told @entity0 that what made @entity28 's shots unique was that he always demanded total access to the rock stars			1
" he really was everywhere with the musicians on the tour bus or offstage , " @entity57 said			2
" he always had his camera with him			0
people ignored the camera in a sense			0
it was an extension of him			0
he had the ability to be a fly on the wall			0
" @entity28 's ability to camouflage without disturbing the band 's dynamic also allowed him to experience the touring life of the @entity8 , @entity57 said			1
" it really set the precedent for the rock star concert tour , " she said			1
" they had their own plane , lots of drugs , lots of alcohol			0
there was a lot going on			0
" @entity57 said that @entity28 's strong personality , fierce passion for music and his drive to get the best pictures while maintaining a sense of camaraderie made him relatable to musicians such as @entity97			1
" he was their friend , " she said			0
" he partied with them			0
as @entity5 said in the foreword of the book , on the tour he was like another @entity106			2
" but @entity28 most enjoyed capturing those quiet moments , when the musicians took off their performer masks and were just themselves , she said			2
one only has to look at photos of @entity3 onstage and off it to see the different personas			2
" @entity3 was very business - oriented , " @entity57 said			0
" @entity3 was much more serious than @entity5			0
that 's what a lot of people do n't realize is that he was the businessman of the band			0
" @entity57 said that while @entity28 spent a short time following the @entity8 , it was enough to create a bond with some of the members , especially @entity97			1
but the most important task for @entity28 during his career , whether it was the @entity126 ' final concert in 1966 or @entity128 's performance during the @entity129 in 1967 , was to capture the feeling of music , a task that could seem quite impossible			1
" @entity28 was always trying to show the true face of whatever he photographed , " @entity57 said			1
" he shattered stereotypes of what rock stars are supposed to look like			0
he said , ' i was a historian with a camera and i did n't know it			0
' he was photographing pieces of history			0
