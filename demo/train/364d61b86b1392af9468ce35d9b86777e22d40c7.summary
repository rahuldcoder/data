@entity0 -- for the first time in almost two weeks , the name of presumptive @entity4 leader @entity3 has appeared in state media , but it was n't to dampen speculation about his " disappearance " weeks before a major @entity11 congress			1
instead , the 59 - year - old vice president 's name appeared on a message of condolence following the death on september 6 of a former official in @entity19			1
" after the passing of comrade @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity3 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 expressed their condolences and conveyed their deep sympathies to his family , " it said			1
@entity3 's name appeared second on the list after current president @entity23 , and before other leaders including @entity24 , head of the powerful @entity35 department who , like @entity3 , is tipped for a place on the @entity38 , the nine - member team who leads @entity4			1
jockeying for position ahead of @entity4 's leadership jamboree the message did not include any direct quotes from @entity3 , and its existence does n't provide any explanation as to why @entity3 has dropped from public view			1
the vice president has not been seen in public since september 1 when he was reported to have given a speech to the @entity51 in @entity52			1
images published by major news websites after the date showed @entity3 looking well and smartly dressed in a dark suit and purple tie			2
however , since then , the cancellation of a number of meetings with high - profile foreign dignitaries has created a storm of speculation as rumor and hearsay fill the void of official information			0
who are the next generation of @entity4 leaders ? for a number of days , @entity4 foreign ministry spokesman , @entity71 , has declined to answer queries on @entity3 at the @entity76 's daily press briefings			1
when @entity3 's meeting with @entity78 secretary of state @entity80 was abruptly canceled on september 5 , @entity78 officials said their @entity4 counterparts had blamed a " scheduling conflict			1
" no official reasons were given following the cancellation of other appointments , including a meeting with @entity88 prime minister @entity87			0
the lack of comment has fueled unsubstantiated rumors , including wild plot lines ranging from a car crash , to an assassination attempt			0
others say @entity3 has been sidelined by a suspected heart attack or stroke , neither of which have been denied or confirmed			2
it is not unknown for @entity4 leaders to suffer serious illnesses in secret			2
in april 1993 , @entity103 , the then premier , disappeared for six weeks after a heart attack			0
the foreign ministry said he had " a cold " and confirmation that he had been treated in hospital did not come until this july			0
" in most countries including in @entity116 , people are entitled to know the health of their leaders , but in @entity4 this is still regarded as state secrets , " @entity109 , a longtime @entity4 watcher who teaches politics and history at universities in @entity0 and @entity113 , told @entity1 monday			2
during @entity3 's absence , other @entity4 leaders have made a number of high - profile appearances outside @entity4			1
@entity23 has addressed @entity126 delegates in @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity4 's top legislator , @entity129 , met with @entity131 president @entity130 in @entity132			1
@entity4 expert @entity133 , of the @entity134 in @entity135 , says that the mere presence of a high - ranking official on foreign trips indicates that @entity4 's leadership is not dealing with a crisis			1
" if @entity3 was gravely ill or had encountered political problems , which would call into question his anointment as head of the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) at the upcoming @entity146 , senior leaders would not be traveling and the leadership would be convening in @entity52			2
that is standard @entity11 practice at a time of crisis , " she wrote in a recent column			0
in a matter of weeks , more than 2,000 delegates are expected to meet in @entity52 for the @entity11 's 18th @entity156			0
during their event , @entity4 's political elite are expected to announce the results of months of political maneuvering , and the names of the five to seven new entrants to @entity38			1
" the @entity4 leadership is worried about social stability , " said @entity163 , a seasoned @entity4 observer and a professor at @entity165			2
" but nothing creates greater social instability than this kind of lack of information about the leadership			0
" already , @entity4 's leadership transition has been marred by extraordinary twists and turns			1
in april , @entity177 , once considered to be among party royalty and a fast - rising star within the party , was stripped of his leadership positions for an unspecified " breach of party discipline			0
" he has not been seen publicly since			0
disgraced party chief looms large over @entity4 's leadership @entity177 's wife , @entity186 , was convicted last month of murdering @entity187 , a @entity188 businessman , and received a suspended death sentence			2
and @entity177 's former police chief , @entity190 , whose attempt in february to seek asylum in a @entity78 @entity193 triggered the scandal , was charged last week with defection and bribe - taking			0
although most analysts agree the all - important 18th @entity156 will be held in the middle of next month , though authorities have yet to confirm the date			0
" more questions are now being asked about the transparency of @entity4 politics since everything is in a black box , " said @entity109			0
observers say the official silence could also signal last - minute negotiations among senior political figures before they present a facade of unity to the public			0
the current generation of leaders has been particularly sensitive to maintaining a united front since 1989 , when the party hierarchy split over how to deal with pro-democracy protests in @entity52 's @entity219			0
" @entity3 is already projected to be a weak leader because he does n't have a power base of his own , " said @entity109 , who predicted @entity23 will remain the head of the @entity4 military for two to three years after relinquishing his party and state titles to @entity3 " @entity23 could be the ultimate winner here -- he will be the power behind the throne			1

@entity4 media mentions @entity3 in statement of condolence
vice president @entity3 has n't been seen in public since september 1
@entity4 officials have failed to comment on why he 's dropped from public view
@entity3 is expected to *replace* @entity23 in the leadership transition later this year
