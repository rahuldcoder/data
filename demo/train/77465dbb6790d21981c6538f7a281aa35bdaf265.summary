-- it will be former world no. 1 against former world no. 1 when @entity3 lines up against @entity4 in the women 's final at @entity6 on sunday -- a tale of two careers that have headed in opposite directions			1
while @entity3 completed her recovery from longterm injury problems by completing her collection of grand slam titles at last year 's @entity14 , @entity4 is still waiting for her first major crown as she battles to remain among the game 's top 10			1
@entity3 returned to second in the rankings following friday 's 6 - 4 6 - 3 semifinal victory over fellow @entity21 @entity20 , as another former no. 1 -- defending champion @entity22 -- slipped down after pulling out of her quarterfinal clash with @entity4 due to an ankle injury			1
the @entity25 , meanwhile , battled into her third final in four years at the @entity28 hard - court tournament as she came from behind to overcome @entity30 fourth seed @entity29 2 - 6 6 - 4 7 - 5			2
" @entity3 is a great competitor and fights for every point , " @entity4 said of her next opponent , who she thrashed in the 2011 semis on the way to winning the title			1
" she plays very aggressively and tries to take every ball on the rise and plays very flat -- it 's going to be very tough			2
" @entity3 , who won the desert event in 2006 and was runnerup last year , has a 4 - 2 advantage over the world no. 10 and won both their encounters after that @entity6 @entity46 defeat			1
" @entity4 is dangerous when she has the opportunities to open up the court and runs you side to side , " said the 25 - year - old , who will be seeking her 28th @entity50 title while @entity4 aims for a 21st			1
the 22 - year - old will try to stifle @entity3 's power game on a surface that suits her patient baseline approach			1
" i really enjoy this tournament -- i think it shows , " @entity4 said			2
" i think the court suits me very well			0
i like that it goes fast through the air but it 's a pretty slow court			0
" it 's a game of chess out there -- if you play it here , you expect it here			2
' wait , is it short ? okay , go in and attack			0
is it deep ? you need to play deep back because you do n't want her to attack			0
' " it 's a game of finding out where is the toughest for the opponent to get to the ball			0
" in the men 's tournament , @entity79 has reached his fourth successive final since making his comeback from longterm injury after beating sixth - seeded @entity86 @entity85 6 - 4 7 - 5 in the first of saturday 's semifinals			1
" it 's completely unexpected , " said @entity79 , who won two out of three clay events before heading to the @entity91 " to be in the final ... it 's a big surprise but i 'm here and i 'm very , very happy			1
" the @entity96 will face @entity97 , who eliminated @entity98 1			0
@entity99 4 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 4 to end the @entity102 's 22 - match winning streak			2
" he 's a big challenge for me also , " @entity97 told reporters of @entity79			1
" he will want to win this tournament , for sure , and it 's going to be very interesting match			2
" @entity99 had won 17 matches since the start of the year , which included his run to a fourth @entity111 crown and the @entity113 title in @entity114			0
" it happens , " @entity99 told reporters			0
" all the credit to my opponent today			0
he deserved to win because he was more composed in the important moments and he played the right shots			0
" he stepped into the court , where , on the other side , me , i made a lot of unforced errors and was at back of the court too passive			0

@entity3 will play fellow former world no. 1 @entity4 in final
