@entity0 -- ahead of direct talks between @entity4 and the @entity5 on thursday , president @entity2 said wednesday night that he was " hopeful -- cautiously hopeful " that the talks could achieve a two - state solution to the long running @entity9 conflict			1
" though each of us holds a title of honor --- president , prime minister , king --- we are bound by the one title we share , " @entity2 said on a stage with @entity4 prime minister @entity19 , @entity21 president @entity20 and the leaders of @entity23 and @entity24			1
" we are fathers , blessed with sons and daughters , " @entity2 said			2
" so we must ask ourselves what kind of world do we want to bequeath to our children and our grandchildren			0
" the president was speaking at the start of a working @entity33 dinner with @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity24 's @entity34 and @entity23 president @entity35			1
each made remarks before the dinner			0
also attending the dinner were secretary of state @entity39 middle east quartet representative @entity38			0
the quartet consists of the @entity41 , @entity42 , the @entity43 and the @entity44			0
" we do n't seek a brief interlude between two wars , we do n't seek a temporary respite between outbursts of terror , " @entity19 said			1
" we seek a peace that will end the conflict between us once and for all ... for our generation , our children 's generation and the next			1
" @entity19 and @entity20 condemned attacks against the @entity4 in recent days			1
" we do not want any blood to be shed -- one drop of blood from the @entity4 or the @entity5 , " said @entity20			1
" we want peace between the two countries ... let us sign a formal agreement for peace and put an end to this long period of suffering forever			1
" in earlier remarks from the @entity66 , @entity2 said that " this moment of opportunity may not soon come again			2
" with the @entity41 war in @entity70 drawing to a close , the @entity9 moved front and center for administration officials wednesday as @entity2 held a series of high - stakes meetings with @entity4 and @entity78 leaders			2
@entity2 huddled behind closed doors at the @entity33 with the @entity4 and @entity78 leaders			1
on wednesday night , @entity2 called the talks " very productive			1
" but he also pointed to challenges ahead			0
" we are under no illusions , " he said			0
" passions run deep ... there 's a reason that the two - state solution has eluded previous generations --- this is extraordinarily complex and extraordinarily difficult			2
" " but , " he continued , " we know that the status quo is unsustainable			0
" @entity2 and @entity19 met first on wednesday , briefly addressing reporters to condemn , in @entity2 's words , the " senseless slaughter " of two men and two women tuesday near the @entity96 city of @entity97			1
" terrorists ... are purposely trying to undermine these talks , " @entity2 said			1
" the message should go out ( that this attack ) is not going to stop " the @entity41 from backing @entity4 and the peace process			2
later , after meeting with @entity20 , he said that " we are making progress " in negotiations			2
during his meetings with @entity20 and @entity34 , according to the @entity33 , @entity2 was joined by secretary of state @entity107 , chief of staff @entity108 , national security advisor gen. @entity109 , and former sen. @entity110 , among others			1
@entity110 is @entity2 's special envoy for @entity9 peace			1
at stake is a unique " window of opportunity " for a breakthrough in the @entity4 - @entity21 conflict within the next year , according @entity110			2
talks have been stalled for a year and a half			2
the hurdles , however , remain steep			0
one immediate threat is the looming september 26 expiration of @entity4 's 10 - month freeze on settlement construction in the @entity96			0
chief @entity21 negotiator @entity124 indicated to @entity1 this week that if @entity4 does not extend the freeze , direct talks may quickly fall apart			0
@entity19 will have " closed the door in my face " if settlement construction resumes , @entity124 said			2
pressed on whether the @entity21 delegation would walk out of talks at that point , @entity124 said that " we will not be able to go			0
" @entity19 can have settlements or peace , but he ca n't have both , @entity124 said			1
another roadblock to any comprehensive deal is the @entity21 view that any two - state solution must include a handover of all the land @entity4 captured in the 1967 war , along with @entity143 as the @entity21 capital			0
while @entity19 has expressed openness about a @entity21 state , he has expressed strong opposition to a @entity21 takeover of @entity143			2
the issue of @entity151 control of @entity152 , @entity124 noted , also remains a " major problem			0
" while @entity152 is generally considered to be part of any future @entity21 state , @entity151 has refused to recognize @entity4 's right to exist and is not a part of the talks			0
@entity151 leaders are frequently in conflict with the more moderate @entity20 and his @entity162 organization , which has the upper hand in the @entity96			1
@entity110 , however , told reporters tuesday that both @entity19 and @entity20 are noting polls showing fear of intensified conflict if negotiations fall apart			1
this is " a moment in time within which there remains the possibility of achieving the two - state solution , " @entity110 asserted			0
" the alternatives ... pose far greater difficulties and far greater problems in the future			0
" several top officials close to the negotiations conceded to @entity1 that it is hard to be optimistic about a peace deal at the moment			0
they downplayed expectations , saying that nobody directly involved in the talks expects a deal to be reached this week			0
but simply resuming talks was a critical step , and a comprehensive @entity9 peace deal has been one of @entity2 's top foreign policy goals , they said			1
" the biggest breakthrough would be an agenda [ emerging thursday ] for a second round of meetings soon to move forward , " one top official actively engaged in the talks said			0
@entity200 is set to play the main role in the talks on thursday , hosting a meeting at the @entity204 with @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity1 's @entity205 and @entity206 contributed to this report			0

@entity2 says he is " hopeful -- cautiously hopeful " about the talks
@entity19 says , " we seek a peace that will end the conflict between us "
@entity20 says , " let us ... put an end to this long period of suffering forever "
@entity2 is hosting @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity35 , and @entity34 at the @entity33
