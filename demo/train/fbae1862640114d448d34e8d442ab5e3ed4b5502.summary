as the night wore on , the buildings at @entity2 's @entity1 stood out , silhouetted against a backdrop of oily , orange blazes , the night air punctuated with the unmistakable chatter of machine - gun fire			1
we arrived on the scene shortly after the @entity11 - claimed attack began on the country 's largest airport on sunday night , which left 28 dead -- including 10 attackers -- and 24 injured			1
the airport , located off the city 's main arterial @entity20 road , had already been sealed off by @entity21 , a heavily - armed paramilitary force			1
a number of vehicles -- both emergency and military -- lined the route in			0
we watched hundreds more rangers pouring in on the back of pickup trucks , guns mounted on top of each one			0
terminal targeted even by the time the media had assembled at the scene , it was apparent things were far from settled			2
there was a commotion of people around the airport as gun battles still raged nearby , while thick plumes of black smoke drifted high into the sky as what smelled like aviation fuel burned			1
the gunmen had targeted @entity49 , the old terminal that had fallen out of regular use			2
this terminal is only ever used for people flying to and from pilgrimages , for private flights , or sometimes government flights			2
the gunmen may have chosen this part of the airport as an infiltration point because it is largely vacant			1
the attackers were trying to cut through barbed wire to get into the airport when they were spotted by @entity64 personnel ( @entity64 )			2
a heavy gun battle ensued and four @entity64 members were killed -- the first fatalities of the attack			1
the terrorists apparently divided into two groups and hid in two different hangars near the terminal building			0
one was a hangar run by the national carrier , @entity74 ( @entity74 ) , and the other to the right -- where the thick black smoke plumed up before their eyes -- was a large hangar , known as the @entity80 , which is used for wide - body aircraft maintenance			2
police said one gunman detonated a suicide vest after being cornered in one of the hangars that contained fuel			2
gunmen killed by the early hours of monday morning , senior government officials had made the vip area of the terminal building their makeshift command center			1
we 'd just finished an interview with the chief minister of @entity97 province , @entity98 , when a group of senior military and police chiefs walked in looking very confident			0
they shook hands with the chief minister and declared that the militants had been killed			0
there was a quiet a moment of relief among everyone in the room			0
by contrast , we witnessed a disheveled group of airport workers leaving the building shortly after , their clothes soiled and torn			1
most would not talk to the media , saying they were too traumatized to discuss their ordeal			0
but one older man described how the gunmen ran towards him and his colleagues and started shooting			0
he said they ran and hid in the toilet			0
while they were in there , he said they heard what they thought was a bomb			0
though they feared the roof would collapse on them , they stayed hidden there for hours until soldiers arrived and told them it was safe to come out			0
the eyewitness , who asked not to be named , said some of the assailants were disguised as airport security workers , something that was later corroborated by @entity147 's ( @entity146 ) @entity145			1
he said others were dressed in black as airport security force commandos .			1
