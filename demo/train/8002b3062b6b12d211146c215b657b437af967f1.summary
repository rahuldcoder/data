@entity0 -- @entity0 agreed in a settlement tuesday to pay $ 98 million in back pay and benefits to entry - level firefighters who claim the @entity6 used a biased entrance exam that kept @entity8 and @entity9 off the job			1
the @entity11 sued the city in may 2007 , alleging the exams â € ” first administered in 1999 â € ” both discriminated against minority candidates and did n't properly determine who was qualified for the positions			1
a @entity19 district judge ordered the city to pay $ 128 million and to hire 293 black and @entity21 applicants , provided they pass all of the tests in the hiring process			1
the first groups of these candidates joined the fire department in july 2013 and january , with an additional group expected to join in july			2
the financial issue had remained a sticking point			0
however , current mayor @entity32 's administration did not seem to have former mayor @entity34 's desire to continue fighting the suit			0
" this administration is fully committed to promoting diversity and equal access in every sector across our five boroughs , and this settlement will move @entity0 one step closer to this goal , " de @entity32 said in a written statement			0
among the steps the city says it will take to increase minority hiring will be the creation of a chief diversity and inclusion officer position within the fire department			2
@entity54 , who was president of the @entity55 , which represents black firefighters , when the suit was filed , said tuesday , " hopefully , after almost 150 years of blacks being excluded from the best uniformed job in the city , we are witnessing a turning point			1
" as part of @entity19 and @entity64 vs. @entity0 , a group of black firefighters alleged the city had intentionally discriminated against them , violating @entity65 , the @entity66 and state law			1
the lawsuit alleged that the exams had little to do with firefighting and instead focused on cognitive and reading skills			2
because of the hereditary nature of the fire department , white candidates were recruited and supported throughout the application process by family or neighborhood contacts , and whites consistently passed while minority candidates failed			2
" there has been one persistent stain on the @entity84 's record , " the lawsuit said			2
" for decades , black and other minority firefighters have been severely underrepresented in the @entity6 's ranks			1
" this pattern of underrepresentation has remained essentially unchanged since at least the 1960s			0
while the city 's other uniformed services have made rapid progress integrating black members into their ranks , the @entity84 has stagnated and at times retrogressed			0
" the lack of minorities in @entity19 fire departments has been the focus of many lawsuits around the nation			0
however , some big cities have diversified their ranks much faster			0
more than half of the @entity104 and @entity105 fire department members are black or @entity21			1
the settlement still needs to be approved by the district court			0
" we look forward to a new era in which @entity8 and @entity113 firefighters are full and equal participants in the @entity6 's proud tradition of protecting and serving the people of the city of @entity0 , " said @entity108 , @entity19 attorney for the @entity109			1
@entity1 's @entity117 contributed to this report .			0
