@entity0 -- who knew what , and when ? some congressional democrats are calling for an investigation into controversial @entity6 interrogation techniques			1
those questions , focused on recently released @entity9 - era @entity6 memos detailing " enhanced interrogations " of suspected @entity12 members -- are now being posed inside the @entity13 , as calls by @entity3 for an independent investigation into torture allegations have become louder			1
@entity18 minority leader @entity17 said thursday that the release of what he described as the " torture " memos is politically motivated			2
" last week , they [ @entity25 administration ] released these memos outlining torture techniques			1
that was clearly a political decision and ignored the advice of their director of national intelligence [ @entity33 ] and their @entity6 director [ @entity34 ] , " @entity17 said			1
the @entity36 @entity35 pointed out that he saw a partial list of the number of members of the @entity18 and @entity40 , @entity3 and @entity35 " who were briefed on these interrogation methods and not a word was raised at the time , not one word			1
" rep. @entity45 , @entity46 , also blasted concerns being raised by @entity3			1
" only now that we have a new administration are people coming out who were aware of these programs saying wait a minute , these were terrible programs			2
in reality , two , three years ago , they signed off on it , they voted for legislation that funded these programs , and now all of a sudden these are terrible practices , " he said			2
but when asked whether or not she raised objections to the interrogation measures at the time , house speaker @entity60 -- a then - ranking member of the @entity61 -- vehemently said " we were not , i repeat , we were not told that waterboarding or other enhanced methods were used			1
" " what they did tell us is that they had some legislative counsel ... but not that they would			0
and that further , further the point was that if an when they would be used they would brief @entity74 at that time , " she added			2
president @entity25 has called waterboarding -- which simulates drowning -- torture , and has defended releasing the @entity6 memos			1
one memo showed that @entity6 interrogators used waterboarding at least 266 times on suspected @entity12 leader @entity81 and @entity82 , the suspected mastermind behind the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the @entity85			2
earlier this week , @entity25 left open the possibility of criminal prosecution tuesday for former @entity9 administration officials who drew up the legal basis for aggressive interrogation techniques many view as torture			1
@entity25 said it will be up to attorney general @entity94 to decide whether or not to prosecute the former officials			1
prosecutions of @entity6 interrogators carrying out @entity98 orders would not , however , be prosecuted , according to @entity25 and @entity94			1
sen. @entity99 said he agreed that @entity6 operatives should n't face prosecution , but is " not prepared to say the same for the senior @entity9 administration officials who authorized or directed these policies in the first place			1
" " the focus for right now should be on finding the facts , " the @entity106 @entity105 added			0
sen. @entity109 , the @entity110 @entity105 who is chairman of the @entity111 , has said that he wants a commission of inquiry to look into the matter			0
" we must take a thorough accounting of what happened , not to move a partisan agenda , but to own up to what was done in the name of national security , and to learn from it , " he said			0
but the @entity40 's top @entity105 said thursday that it 's important for both @entity3 and @entity35 to take a step back and let the appropriate investigation take place			1
majority leader @entity127 said while he does n't support an independent " truth commission " to look into the affair , he does want the @entity130 to take the lead			0
" i think it would be very unwise from my perspective to start having commissions , boards , tribunals until we find out what the facts are			0
i do n't know a better way to get the facts than through the intelligence committee , " he said			0
that position puts @entity127 at odds with @entity60 , who said thursday that , " i have always been for a truth commission			0
" earlier this week , the @entity146 released a 230 - page report detailing interrogation tactics used at the @entity149 in @entity150 -- and the methods employed at @entity152			1
the report showed that top @entity9 administration officials gave the @entity6 approval to use waterboarding , a controversial interrogation technique , as early as 2002			1
" these are 230 pages of facts as to how abusive techniques were used , what i consider to be abominable legal opinions were written to justify those techniques , " chairman @entity158 , @entity159 , told @entity1			0
read more on the report @entity158 now wants the @entity98 to investigate exactly what happened -- something @entity25 called for on tuesday			1
on thursday afternoon , @entity94 told a @entity169 on the memo prosecution question , " i will not permit the criminalization of policy differences			0
" but , he said , " it is my responsibility as the attorney general to enforce the law			0
it is my duty to enforce the law			0
if i see evidence of wrongdoing i will pursue it to the fullest extent of the law and i will do that in an appropriate way			0
" other democrats are calling for criminal inquiries to be held			2
" it is the duty of the @entity85 under the law to at least have an investigation , " rep. @entity189 , @entity191 - @entity190 , said			0
@entity3 leadership sources say , however , that strong @entity35 resistance makes that a hard sell			1
@entity127 insisted that despite calls for investigations and even prosecutions to take place , there is no @entity3 divide			1
" justice must be served			0
retribution ought not be what were talking about , " he added			0
resistance has begun to show -- coming from a top @entity40 @entity35			1
sen. @entity209 -- a @entity210 who was tortured -- has been a vocal opponent of the practice			0
but on wednesday , he told reporters that it 's important for the country to move forward			0
" if we prosecute individuals for providing their best recommendation to the president of the @entity85 , it will have a chilling effect from now on , " the @entity216 @entity35 said			1
ireport.com : share your take on torture @entity209 -- along with sens. @entity229 , i - @entity226 , and @entity227 , @entity46 - @entity228 -- on wednesday sent a letter to @entity25 strongly urging him not to prosecute government officials who provided legal advice related to detainee interrogations			1
" pursuing such prosecutions would , we believe , have serious negative effects on the candor with which officials in any administration provide their best advice , and would take our country in a backward - looking direction at a time when our detainee - related challenges demand that we look forward , " they said in the letter			2
the senators ' concerns are also being echoed by @entity25 's defense secretary , who warns of the consequences abroad			2
defense secretary @entity251 said thursday that he was is concerned with the " potential backlash " in the @entity253 and in the war zones			0
he said the release might have a negative impact on the troops			0
but @entity251 said with all the congressional investigations being released and lawsuits , the release of the memos was going to happen			2
" there is a certain inevitability that much of this will eventually come out , " @entity251 said			0
" pretending that we could hold all this and keep it all a secret , even if we wanted to , i think was probably unrealistic			0
" @entity1 's @entity269 and @entity271 's @entity270 contributed to this report .			2
