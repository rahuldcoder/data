@entity0 , @entity1 's largest lake , has been plagued by water hyacinth plants for over two decades			1
while its flowers can be beautiful its foliage can grow to cover large swaths of the waters in a dense green mat of leaves that choke the shoreline of fish			1
fishermen often struggle each day for a meager catch , but an entrepreneurial weaver has found that the invasive plant can be a free source of material for the area 's women who make handicrafts			1
" when we make products from this hyacinth , we are empowering women economically			1
they become self - reliant			0
that means we are alleviating poverty , " said @entity24 , who heads @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27			0
the organization , which sells products ranging from handbags to furniture , aims to give employment to disadvantaged women , youths and those with disabilities			0
for years , the area 's weavers have used banana and sisal fibers to make their wares			1
they are now turning to hyacinth because of its abundance			0
but if the weavers ' craft is flourishing , many in the local fishing community are suffering			2
water hyacinth grows into a thick bed of waxy leaves and violet flowers that cover the surface of the lake			1
it is native to @entity58 but was introduced in @entity1 in the late 1800s			0
the plant species can double its mass every five days , according to scientists			1
because of its dense growth , it blocks sunlight from reaching the lake 's native aquatic plants , which affects fish and other marine life -- and those who make their livelihoods catching them			1
" it has really affected us because the quantity of fish that we used to get from this lake has diminished , " said @entity73 , a fisherman			2
the difficulties faced by the fishing community are evident at the local markets , where instead of fish traders and buyers loudly haggling over prices , there are only a few quiet voices			2
the weavers are not even putting a dent into the sheer growth of the plant , which at the moment is particularly severe			1
" it goes all the way -- the furthest you can actually see , " said @entity92 , a research scientist who is working with the government to mitigate the environmental problems caused by hyacinth			0
" this is the biggest acreage of water hyacinth since it was first reported in @entity0 in 1992			1
" methods that have been tried in the past include the release of @entity58 weevils that eat the plant , as well as machinery that shreds from the water surface			2
these efforts worked for a while but were not seen as a permanent solution			0
@entity92 does not advocate the weavers ' use of hyacinth , because transporting it from the lake to their homes could help the plant spread			1
however @entity24 says she thinks the weavers could make a real contribution to the removal of the harmful plant from the lake			1
she would like to see support for the project and to have the resources for machinery that would help make thousands of meters of hyacinth rope each day			2
" if we have like a factory somewhere , we 'll be consuming a lot of hyacinth , " @entity24 said			0
the wares that @entity24 's group creates are sold mainly in large towns across @entity27			0
the finished items are not cheap , and some she says some locals do not appreciate the innovation of utilizing a menacing weed			0
" they say , ' you normally get this hyacinth free of charge from the lake			2
you should sell it for 20 shilling			0
' they 're not looking at the time and skill of coming up with new products and a competitive product , " she said			0
invasive species : eat them before they eat everything			0
