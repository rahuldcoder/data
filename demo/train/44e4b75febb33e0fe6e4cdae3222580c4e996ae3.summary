-- food fanatics may recognize @entity2 from his stints on tv shows like " the @entity5 " and " top chef masters , " but @entity8 residents know the @entity10 - raised chef and ex-marine as an evangelist for local food culture			1
after @entity14 devastated his city in 2005 , @entity2 rallied the teams at his flagship restaurant august to feed the @entity18 , @entity20 troops , evacuees , refugees and medical personnel			1
he also set up field kitchens for rural parish residents after hurricanes @entity26 and @entity28 in 2008			2
@entity2 's 2009 love letter to his city 's distinctive cuisine , a nearly 400 - page volume of recipes , photographs , stories and field guides to local ingredients entitled " my @entity8 " was recently named best cookbook of the year by the @entity39			1
with his region 's foodways again in peril , @entity2 spoke with @entity0 about what 's at risk from the @entity46 oil spill and what @entity48 eaters can do to help			1
@entity0 : from a food perspective , what 's at stake ? @entity2 : we have a rig that 's about 45 miles off the southern tip of @entity10 -- that little bit of land that just happens to be some of the most incredibly rich marshland , which feeds an enormous ecosystem			1
so , some of the most fragile land on the face of the earth -- at least in @entity64			2
two - thirds of the production of seafood from the lower 48 states comes from this ecosystem			1
it all begins with the micro-organisms in the marsh grasses at the mouth of the @entity73			2
there are other rivers there , too , but it 's the mighty @entity73 that feeds it all			1
we have to act swiftly , as if we were going to war			2
we have to protect this coastline			1
there are not just jobs ; there are communities and cultures			1
family - owned restaurant fears ' devastating glob ' @entity0 : how will this affect the local economy -- especially the shrimpers ? @entity2 : one thing in particular that 's been a real slap in the face to the @entity48 shrimper is the rapid importation , unchecked , of foreign shrimp flooding our market			1
we do n't know what waters they come from , we do n't know what they were fed. we really know very little about their origin			2
yet we accept them with open arms in our country -- a lot of time using slave labor to process these things that we 're feeding our children and eating in our massive chain restaurants			1
these shrimpers , these communities have been through hurricane after hurricane			1
they really got back on their feet themselves -- very resilient people			2
and now we 're dragging our feet -- this slow , very delayed response to the waters			0
we 're talking about this ecosystem that 's a source , that 's a $ 2.9 billion a year industry just in our region for shrimp and oysters and crab -- along with some fin fish production			1
this whole industry [ is ] on the verge of collapse if we do not act swiftly			0
@entity0 : what can @entity48 outside the @entity46 do to help ? @entity2 : we need people to really be unified about this			1
it 's more than just about a job			0
because it 's really about a culture			0
we need to preserve our environment			0
[ president ] @entity141 was put in office for the very things he claims to have espoused , yet now we 're seeing that administration really dragging their feet with this one -- and that 's a huge shock to all of us			0
and that 's why we 're asking everybody out there -- call your representatives , call your senator , call whoever			0
one thing you can do right now is eat @entity48 shrimp			1
@entity0 : how can diners make sure it 's domestic ? @entity2 : each state has its own laws , but in many , grocery stores have to label the origin of the shrimp			1
demand , demand , demand , and they will have to supply it in order to pay their bills			2
@entity0 : what can chefs do ? @entity2 : chefs should be very mindful of the origin of their seafood			1
we still have a lot to work on			0
we have a lot to clean up			0
but perhaps we can still salvage that culture and the industry			0
not to mention all the environmental effects			0
@entity0 : what are you doing at your own restaurants like august , @entity189 and @entity190 ? @entity2 : we 're focused on supporting oyster families -- like @entity193 -- and local shrimpers by buying from our shore -- at least stabilizing as best we can the few people who are out there and able to make a living at it			1
and we have an active feeding arrangement going on			0
we 're taking food down to the mouth of the river when the mitigation stabilizes			0
like just when we were rebuilding after @entity14 , we 'll come and rebuild the restaurants -- we 're going to feed you			2
you want to come save our environment ? we 're going to feed you			2
@entity0 : what does the future hold for @entity46 cuisine in light of this disaster ? @entity2 : we have no idea what we 're dealing with yet because @entity216 tells us one thing , the government tells us another			1
even those reports have been skewed -- it may be up to five times worse than what our government is even saying			0
right now , there 's just this big question and our question is not to cast blame right now			0
let 's just deal with it			0
let 's bring in all of our resources -- the @entity231 if need be -- because we 're an incredible country			0
we can do so much			0
i love @entity64 and i 'm not against oil			2
but we 've got to figure out how to handle crises like this before they become crises			0
that 's my plea to everybody			0
get out there and get involved			0
make it known that we 've got to save the @entity46 .			1

chef @entity2 : we should wage campaign to save @entity46 from oil slick
need to protect " most incredibly rich marshland , which feeds an enormous ecosystem "
he says not just jobs are at stake , but also communities and cultures
he urges @entity48 to demand @entity48 shrimp at grocery stores and restaurants
