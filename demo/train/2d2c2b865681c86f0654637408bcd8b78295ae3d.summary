@entity0 -- president @entity3 's disapproval rating has reached a new high of 55 % while the number of @entity6 who think he is a strong leader has dropped to a new low , 48 % , according to a @entity1 / @entity9 poll released tuesday			1
and a familiar pattern in public opinion on @entity3 again asserts itself : @entity6 do n't like his track record on major issues while they continue to like him personally			1
nearly eight in 10 respondents say @entity3 is likeable ; large majorities believe he is compassionate , hard - working , and has a vision for the country 's future			1
three - quarters think he fights for his beliefs			0
but only 39 % approve of how he is handling unemployment , and just 36 % approve of the way he is handling the economy , not surprising when more than eight in 10 think the economy is in poor shape			1
opinion on @entity3 's economic track record is mixed , however			1
while fewer than one in 10 ( 9 % ) think his policies have made the economy better , about four in 10 ( 39 % ) credit them with preventing the economy from being even worse than it is today			1
on the other side , 37 % say @entity3 has made economic conditions worse			1
fifteen percent think his policies have had no effect			0
overall , 55 % now say they disapprove of how he is handling his job as president			1
that 's one point higher than the 54 % disapproval rating he routinely hit in polls taken in july and august			2
forty - three percent now say they approve of how @entity3 is handling his job overall			2
that is not an all - time low for him ; he hit 42 % a year ago			0
six in 10 say @entity3 has fallen short of their expectations			0
those numbers are not great , but they 're way better than the 15 % who approve of how @entity54 is handling its job			0
one piece of good news for @entity3 is that his standing among the @entity60 base has turned the corner after a drop in the wake of the debt ceiling agreement			0
the number of @entity60 who wanted the party to renominate @entity3 dropped to an all - time low of 70 % in early august , but it rose to 72 % in the previous poll and 76 % in the current survey			2
the poll was conducted for @entity1 by @entity71 september 9 - 11 , with 1,038 adult @entity6 questioned by telephone			2
the survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points			0
the sampling error for the question asked only of @entity60 is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .			0

overall , 55 % of @entity6 say they disapprove of how @entity3 is doing as president
39 % think @entity3 's policies kept the economy from getting worse ; 9 % say they made it better
37 % think his policies have made the economy worse
