@entity0 , @entity1 -- the top ranking is at stake in the men 's game when @entity7 meets @entity8 in sunday 's @entity10 final			1
but do n't let that fool you -- both tennis titans , having held down the no. 1 spot previously , are more concerned about piling up grand slam titles			1
for current holder @entity7 , he 's seeking a record - extending ninth success at @entity10 , an accomplishment that would also see him tie @entity21 for second on the men 's list with 14 majors			1
a bad back and @entity27 , likely in that order of significance , stalled @entity7 in january 's @entity31 final			1
@entity8 , meanwhile , is attempting to become the eighth man to complete a career grand slam and inflict only a second defeat on @entity7 at @entity10			1
their historic 41 - match rivalry has seen streaks of the roller - coaster variety , and second - ranked @entity8 is the man in the ascendancy at the moment , capturing four straight tussles including the final of the @entity44 last month			1
@entity8 stretched @entity7 to five sets last year in the last four , undone by a freak occurrence when he touched the net deep in the fifth			1
" he 's an unbelievable opponent , " @entity7 told the crowd after his semifinal friday			1
" it 's always a big , big challenge			0
" it 's a finale too close to call but based on the semis , @entity7 might just have the upper hand			1
as temperatures soared in @entity0 to about 30 degrees , helping to banish memories of a cold , rainy first week , @entity8 toiled in the heat -- not something new -- before ousting @entity61 's conqueror @entity62 6 - 3 6 - 3 3 - 6 6 - 3			1
he subsequently told @entity1 television he indeed dipped physically in the third			0
@entity7 then had an easier time against @entity67 champion @entity66 , prevailing 6 - 3 6 - 2 6 - 1 in a quick - fire 100 minutes			1
@entity66 always had an uphill task , never overcoming @entity7 in five tries on clay , spending four - and - a - half more hours on court this fortnight -- maybe the equivalent of two matches -- and having to contend with a @entity75 whose heavily spun balls shoot off the clay and spin in the air even more in steamy conditions			1
" today i played my best tennis of the tournament , " @entity7 said			2
@entity7 , probably unlike @entity8 , will be glad to know the mini-heat wave is expected to continue through sunday			1
" for me it 's much better when the weather is like today , " @entity7 later told reporters			2
" it 's obvious that with days like today , it helps my game			0
" i need to play aggressive			0
i need to find my best level , and i 'm gon na try			0
" @entity8 took his time attending the post-match press conference , heightening suspicions something was amiss			2
" there is nothing bothering me , " he said			0
" just the general fatigue that , you know , probably was influenced by conditions or other things that i felt today			0
but i 'm not going to talk about			0
" i 'm glad i won in four sets , because if it went to a fifth , @entity105 knows in which direction the match could go			0
" @entity111 ' coach , @entity110 , said before the semifinals his man had " no chance " against @entity8 , trying to ease the pressure on the reformed @entity115			2
but unlike @entity118 football manager @entity117 , who often resorts to mind games , @entity110 admitted to uttering the words to relax @entity62			2
does n't that defeat the purpose ? ultimately , @entity110 was right			0
@entity8 breezed through the first two sets before a blip in the third -- the third time that transpired this tournament			2
hunched over and hitting with less pace , his malaise allowed @entity62 to force a fourth			2
the problem for @entity62 was that he , too , seemed to be in distress , often clutching his lower back			0
he said afterwards , however , that he was n't hurt			0
@entity8 broke near the end of the fourth set and to his relief served out the match comfortably to achieve a second @entity10 final			1
" i 'm just going to rest today and tomorrow , try to not spend too much energy on the courts and get ready for finals , " said @entity8			0
@entity7 seized the initiative with an early break against @entity66 and never let his grip go			1
his feared forehand was in devastating mode , giving what must have been a jaded @entity66 little opportunity			0
@entity7 never faced a break point and was taken to deuce only once , in his last service game			0
the result countered their tight three - setter in @entity44			0
" you can go out there with all the tactics in the world , but when he 's hitting the ball like that , it 's very difficult to hit the ball where you want to , " @entity66 told reporters			2
@entity8 has the ability to handle @entity7 's cross-court forehand like no other , perhaps a reason @entity110 picked the @entity166 to win the title			1
sunday will tell us if he is right again .			0

@entity8 will face @entity7 in sunday 's @entity10 final
