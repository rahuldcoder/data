@entity23 is one of a growing number of hospitals , web sites , even states , helping patients comparison shop on the internet before undergoing a medical procedure or test			1
hospitals say they 're responding to a growing demand from patients who are paying for more of their health care out of pocket , thanks to rising deductibles and the advent of high deductible , consumer - driven plans like the @entity16 have			1
in the early 2000s , @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity56 , began receiving more calls from patients wanting to know what a particular procedure would cost , said @entity60 , director of revenue cycle management			2
" as sad as it sounds , we had to say we did n't know , " @entity60 said			0
that 's because something like knee replacement is n't one expense but many			0
there are the surgeon 's fee , the operating room charge , equipment and supplies , the hospital bed during recovery , and other costs			2
five years ago , @entity77 put the information together so would - be patients could get an accurate picture of the final bill			1

" @entity23 , with nine hospitals in @entity21 and southwest @entity95 , started my cost in january 2007 , posting the price of more than 500 tests and procedures along with data on quality of care			1
@entity104 , a 14 - hospital system in @entity106 , has a consumer price line number that allows patients to learn what the out - of - pocket costs will be for their procedures			1
the service started in july 2007 after ceo @entity113 had some " secret shoppers " try to get pricing information , said @entity116 , @entity104 spokesperson			1
@entity117 receives between 800 and 1,000 calls a month , she said			0
sixteen state hospital associations operate web sites that allow comparison shopping for such inpatient procedures as appendectomies , maternity stays and knee or hip replacements : @entity127 , @entity95 , @entity128 , @entity21 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity56			1
other states have their own systems			0
@entity143 health care providers collaborated on the @entity145 web site , which allows price comparisons between 110 providers for 103 common medical procedures			1
the web site tells what insurance companies pay , on average , for procedures ranging from caesarean delivery to a colonoscopy			2
@entity155 has detailed price information on cardiac and joint replacement surgeries on its @entity160 web site , but the data are several years old			1
still , it underscores the enormous differences in prices			0
for example , knee replacement costs ranged from $ 11,243 to $ 97,031 at the state 's hospitals			2
even individual hopsitals are striving to offer more transparency			0
@entity171 in @entity172 , @entity130 , posts very detailed information about prices on the hospital 's web site			1
spokesperson @entity178 said it 's part of the medical center 's mission to provide transparency about cost , outcomes and patient satisfaction			0
the information is only a starting point , though , @entity178 said			1
" we want that to drive you to a more informed conversation " with a doctor , he said			0
" a bilateral knee replacement is not like buying a car on the lot			1
" but @entity194 , co-founder of @entity195 , said health care and car buying are a lot more similar than many people think			1
the eight - month - old site was created to do for health care what automobile pricing guides did for new car buying 20 years ago , @entity194 said			1

patients who are not covered in a group plan generally get bills three times as high , he said			2
" just picking up the phone will get you 20 percent off			0
nine times out of 10 , if you want to haggle , it 's more like 50 percent off , " @entity194 says			0
@entity195 , which went live in january , now gets 40,000 to 50,000 users a month , @entity194 says			1
@entity234 , a senior research associate with the @entity235 , said cost sites such as @entity195 are crude tools because they do n't tell people with traditional plans what they 'll pay out of pocket			1
a lot depends on how much of their deductible they 've already spent			0
also , people with expensive chronic diseases such as diabetes usually reach their deductible early in the year and are less concerned about price after that , @entity234 said			0
childbirth is a perfect procedure to price ahead of time , according to @entity254 at @entity255			0
others are not as clear cut			0
with knee surgery , for example , patients may not know the exact procedure they need or what complications could arise , she said			0
@entity28 said knowing what hospital fees would be in advance gave her and her husband peace of mind : " we were able to enjoy the anticipation of @entity30 a little bit more instead of having to worry about the financial piece of it			0
" @entity0 's @entity274 contributed to this report .			0
