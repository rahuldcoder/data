editor 's note : @entity3 contributor @entity2 is a bestselling author whose current book is " when we get to @entity6 : a journey through @entity8 in @entity9			1
" @entity2 says @entity10 has had a great perk : seeing @entity8 on his own bus			1
( @entity3 ) -- you 've undoubtedly heard that @entity10 has left the football broadcast booth			1
what you may not have heard is that he 's not leaving his bus			1
" it 's been such a great ride , " @entity10 said as he announced his retirement			1
but the truly great ride -- the one he will not relinquish -- was n't his long career as a @entity23 broadcaster			2
the best ride was the literal one			0
@entity10 's aversion to flying in airplanes led him to perhaps the grandest business perk in all of @entity8 life : he was given his own bus , with his own professional drivers			1
he crisscrossed the country , on his way from one big game to another , on what came to be known as the @entity36 , the cost of which eventually was underwritten by corporate sponsorship			2
you may think that being stuck in a bus for days and nights on end must be a lousy way to lead a life			2
not when you 're the only passenger -- you , or whatever buddies and colleagues you choose to invite along			0
not when there 's food and drink onboard , and television sets with @entity52 players at the ready , and plenty of room to stretch out and observe the country as it passes by			1
and those amenities leave out the most beautiful lure of all			0
let president @entity59 explain it			0
he did , inadvertently , the other week			0
he was n't talking about @entity10 -- he was talking about plans for a new high - speed rail system			1
these were the president 's words : " no racing to an airport and across a terminal , no delays , no sitting on the tarmac , no lost luggage , no taking off your shoes [ at the metal detector ]			2
. " that 's the gift @entity10 gave himself , by working out the bus deal -- the gift of avoiding the endless headaches of travel the rest of the world has to endure			1
departure time ? whenever he wants			0
flight cancellations ? no such thing			0
security lines ? there are none			0
it can make for a pretty peaceful life			0
a football game to see every week , the country winding gloriously out ahead of you between stadiums , your main decision boiling down to how to chop up the miles , where to eat and where to sleep and where to stop for a few hours just to talk to people			2
. there is a hotel on the west coast of @entity101 where i have stayed quite often , and during football season @entity10 would sometimes stay there too			1
if there had been a game in , say , @entity105 , and the next one was in @entity107 , he might ask his bus driver to stop for the night at this place , which features outlying cottages on the @entity111			2
talk about a guy who seemed tranquil -- i know his on - air image was always sort of loud and animated , but i 'd see @entity10 having a serenely silent and unhurried meal by himself in the restaurant , leisurely flipping through the sports pages ; i 'd see him in the little sandwich shop / deli in the morning , a quiet and amiable fellow standing in line with everyone else , waiting to pay for his breakfast pastries ; i 'd see him , on departure day , strolling blissfully toward his bus , an overnight bag in his hand , having decided that this was the time that he 'd like to roll out			1
. who would ever have thought that a fantasy life could revolve around something as seemingly mundane as a bus ? but in a chaotic and confused world , full of noise and anger and deadlines , the allure of cruising in splendid solitude through the country , seeing @entity8 mile by mile , the journey itself being the ultimate victory			1
. @entity10 is the grand champion of bus riders , the winner of the lifetime achievement award			1
and for those who thought that @entity10 must have felt trapped on that bus for all these years , the truth -- i can promise you this -- is that rolling through the country that way is the opposite of being trapped			1
the highway begins to feel like a best friend ; as well as you may have thought you knew @entity8 before , you begin to understand it in ways you never even considered			1
@entity159 by block , town by town , state by state , you appreciate anew : there are still so many things to see			0
so i was n't surprised when @entity10 , after declaring that the football life he is leaving had been a great ride , said that , by the way , he 's keeping the bus			1
when he travels , that 's how he will do it , with or without a corporate sponsor , even now that there will be no game waiting on the other end			0
and of course , after all these years there is a certain remarkable aura that has formed around the man and that bus of his			0
at the place in @entity101 where he would sometimes stay , i was coming back from dinner one night and saw two local police squad cars on the property			0
this was highly unusual ; the town was a quiet dot on the map			0
i asked the police officers if there had been a crime committed			0
they appeared a little sheepish			0
they exchanged glances , as if deciding whether to tell me their real reason for being there			0
finally one of them laughed , and said : " we just wanted to look at @entity10			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity10 's retiring as a broadcaster but keeping his bus
he says football expert had the ultimate perk for traveling the country
