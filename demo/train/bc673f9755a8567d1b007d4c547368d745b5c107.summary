@entity6 has reported 16 new cases with nine deaths			0
@entity9 has had 34 new cases and 14 deaths since last week			0

in fact , it has been a week since a new case has been reported in that country			0
there have , however , been two deaths reported			0
with their countries facing an @entity37 epidemic , the health ministers of 11 @entity3 nations have agreed to a joint strategy to try to stem its deadly advance			1
as part of the plan , the @entity1 will set up a " sub-regional control center " in @entity21 -- one of the three @entity3 nations at the heart of the outbreak -- to help coordinate the response			1
the strategy was announced last week at the end of a two - day summit in @entity50 that brought together ministers from the @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity50 , @entity21 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity6 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity9 and @entity58 with health experts , @entity37 survivors and @entity1 representatives			1
it also calls for better surveillance and reporting of cases , the mobilization of community and political leaders to improve awareness and understanding , and greater cross-border communication			0
who has previously warned that " drastic action " is needed to halt the spread of the virus , which can kill up to 90 % of those infected			1
addressing the closing session , dr. @entity77 , @entity1 regional director for @entity3 , welcomed the move			2
" it 's time for concrete action to put an end to the suffering and deaths caused by ebola virus disease and prevent its further spread , " he said			1
who reports there have been 844 cases , including 518 deaths , in @entity21 , @entity9 and @entity6 as of july 6			0
' enormous ' impact the impact of the outbreak , which began in march , " has been enormous in terms of loss of human lives and negative socioeconomic effects , " @entity77 said			0
the disease 's spread " is in great extent associated with some cultural practices and traditional beliefs " that run counter to preventive health measures , he said			1
according to a @entity1 statement , such traditional practices foster " mistrust , apprehension and resistance " in local populations regarding health workers ' efforts			1
these include the hiding and treatment at home of @entity37 victims and funerals at which mourners touch the body of the deceased			1
" these are very high - risk practices leading to extensive exposures to ebola virus in the community , " the statement said			1
@entity77 added , " the extensive movement of people within and across borders has facilitated rapid spread of the infection across and within the three countries			2
" he also paid tribute to those on the front lines of the fight against the deadly disease , saying health workers have been " disproportionately affected , " with more than 60 cases and 32 deaths reported among their ranks			1
what you need to know about @entity37 @entity58 takes steps @entity58 's health authorities , who took part in the summit in @entity50 , announced new measures friday to screen people arriving from @entity37 - affected countries			1
" all border posts have been told to intensify disease surveillance check points , " @entity58 health minister @entity150 said			1
" special focus is on anyone with travel history of the past three months from the three @entity3 countries of @entity21 , @entity9 and @entity6			0
" although no travel ban is in place , @entity58 residents have also been urged to limit nonessential travel to those three countries			2
@entity150 said @entity58 , which has experience in dealing with @entity37 outbreaks , most recently in 2012 , had been asked by @entity1 to provide technical assistance in the latest battle to contain the virus			1
@entity168 , external hemorrhaging @entity37 is a violent killer			2
the symptoms , at first , mimic the flu : headache , fever , fatigue			0
what comes next sounds like something out of a horror movie : significant diarrhea and vomiting while the virus shuts off the blood 's ability to clot			2
as a result , patients often suffer internal and external hemorrhaging			0
many die in an average of 10 days			0
people are traveling without realizing they 're carrying the deadly virus			2
it can take between two and 21 days after exposure for someone to feel sick			0
the good news is that @entity37 is n't as easily spread as one might think			1
a patient is n't contagious -- meaning they ca n't spread the virus to other people -- until he or she is showing symptoms			1
the disease is transmitted by direct contact with the blood and body fluids of infected animals or people , according to @entity1			1
the scientist who discovered the ebola virus in the 1970s , dr. @entity207 , told @entity0 's @entity208 this week that the situation is " unprecedented			1
" " one , ( this is ) the first time in @entity3 that we have such an outbreak , " he said			0
" secondly , it is the first time that three countries are involved			0
and thirdly , it 's the first time that we have outbreaks in capitals , in capital cities			2
" officials believe the wide footprint of this outbreak is partly because of the proximity between the jungle where the virus was first identified and cities such as @entity226 , @entity21 's capital , which has a population of 2 million and an international airport			2
complicating matters , the countries hit hardest by the epidemic have major medical infrastructure challenges			0
there is no cure for @entity37 , but in theory , the disease should be easy to fight since close contact is needed to become infected , @entity207 said			2
simple hygienic measures such as washing with soap and water , not reusing syringes and avoiding contact with infected corpses are sufficient to stop spread of the disease , @entity207 said			1
" this is an epidemic of dysfunctional health systems , " he added			0
" fear of the virus , and the lack of trust in government , in the health system , is as bad as the actual virus			0
" get the fast facts on @entity37 we 're aliens in @entity37 's world what is @entity37 , and why does it kill ? @entity0 's @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 and @entity261 contributed to this report			1
