apparently , when it comes to middle - earth , director @entity0 thinks three is the magic number			1
last month at @entity4 , @entity0 teased fans with the idea that he was interested in pushing beyond his planned two - film adaptation of " @entity8			1
" today , after weeks of intensive talks with @entity10 over how exactly that might be achieved , @entity0 announced on his @entity13 page that he is , in fact , going to turn " @entity8 " into a trilogy			1
" it is only at the end of a shoot that you finally get the chance to sit down and have a look at the film you have made , " @entity0 wrote			2
" recently @entity30 [ @entity29 ] , @entity31 ] and i did just this when we watched for the first time an early cut of the first movie â€” and a large chunk of the second			0
we were really pleased with the way the story was coming together , in particular , the strength of the characters and the cast who have brought them to life			0
all of which gave rise to a simple question : do we take this chance to tell more of the tale ? and the answer from our perspective as the filmmakers , and as fans , was an unreserved ' yes			0
' " how exactly @entity8 will be turned into a three - film series is still somewhat unclear , though			2
as @entity0 has acknowledged , " @entity8 " is a slender story compared with the far more sprawling and complex " @entity53 " trilogy			1
but the director is drawing not only on the original book , but also on more than a hundred pages of appendices @entity54 later wrote that expanded on the world of " @entity8			2
" @entity0 is obviously confident that all of this material taken together can sustain three films and hinted in his announcement at what narrative elements will be incorporated to fill out the trilogy			1
" we know how much of the story of @entity69 , the @entity70 , the dwarves of @entity72 , the rise of the @entity74 , and the @entity75 will remain untold if we do not take this chance , " he wrote			0
" the richness of the story of @entity8 , as well as some of the related material in the appendices of @entity53 , allows us to tell the full story of the adventures of @entity69 and the part he played in the sometimes dangerous , but at all times exciting , history of middle - earth			2
" the first installment in the trilogy , subtitled " @entity90 , " hits theaters dec. 14 , 2012			1
the second film is slated for dec. 13 , 2013			0
the last installment will hit theaters in the summer of 2014			0
