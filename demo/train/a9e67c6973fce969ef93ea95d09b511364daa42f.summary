-- the sub-zero climes of northern @entity2 are an unlikely outpost for the world 's hippest tech firms			1
temperatures have been known to plummet to a bone - chilling minus - 40 degrees centigrade in the winter months , while the rural landscape is more commonly associated with the sparkling beauty of the northern lights than the humdrum back office of cloud computing			0
but it 's here , in the tiny @entity14 town of @entity15 , that @entity16 has operated a 30,000 square meter server farm since 2013 -- its first such facility outside the @entity19			2
so content with the operation is the social media giant that it announced the creation a second data center in @entity15 earlier this year			2
according to @entity24 regional head of telecoms firm @entity26 the region has plenty to offer big international companies despite its distant location			2
" there is a lot of ( engineering ) competence ... and good cooperation with the technical universities , " @entity24 said			0
on top of that , good transport links ensure its easily accessible by road and by air while solid infrastructure ensures business stability			0
@entity26 is currently laying down @entity44 , a 1,250 - kilometer ( 776 - mile ) fiber cable that will serve mobile and communications networks as well as provide the digital infrastructure that data centers in northern @entity2 require			1
" as far as we understand it this is one of the best places to establish data centers , " @entity24 added			1
the @entity16 move has inevitably attracted the attention of other firms with large data storage needs			1
@entity15 will soon host another large data facility for @entity60 - based data - storage specialist firm , @entity61 , while the nearby town of @entity63 welcomed @entity65 mining group @entity64 earlier this year			1
across the border in @entity68 , @entity66 runs a similar operation in the town of @entity71			0
and a thousand miles over the @entity72 in @entity76 specialist data storage firm @entity73 caters for large firms likes of @entity79 car manufacturer @entity78			2
with so many wealthy companies with increased data related needs , storage clearly has the potential to become a highly lucrative business in this part of the world			1
a report from management firm , @entity88 estimated that the @entity16 's presence in @entity2 will be worth upwards of 9 billion @entity93 ( $ 1.2 billion ) and 4,500 direct and indirect jobs over a 10 - year period			2
in september this year , meanwhile , the @entity96 cited a report from @entity98 which stated that energy efficiency in the $ 220 billion cloud computing market could become a significant driver of growth			2
@entity104 appeal the attraction of the extreme north for many tech companies is both practical and environmental			1
cold temperatures mean the high costs associated with air conditioning units used to keep servers cool can be drastically reduced			2
an abundance of renewable energy sources , meanwhile , ensures the large amounts of electricity required to power data centers is clean and environmentally friendly			1
@entity76 , for example , currently meets 100 % of its energy needs through geothermal and hydro - electric sources , according to independent energy sector analysts @entity123			2
@entity2 is also blessed with a plethora of natural resources : @entity15 has produced large amounts of hydro - electricity for well over a century			2
" the environmental impact ( of data centers in the north of @entity2 ) is pretty much zero , " said @entity128 of the @entity15 , a regional trade body designed to attract investment into @entity15 , @entity63 and nearby town @entity131			1
" we have about a 50 % surplus from the electricity we produce , " @entity128 added			0
for high - profile companies like @entity16 -- which was once publicly scolded by @entity140 for obtaining 53 % of the electricity it uses from coal sources but has since said it wants to go green -- these are highly attractive qualities			1
@entity98 estimate that information and communication technologies are already consuming 10 % of the world 's produced electricity			1
a report from @entity140 in april this year , meanwhile , found that if the internet was a country , it would rank in the top six energy consuming nations in the world			1
on top of this , @entity140 say demand for electricity that powers internet usage is expected to increase by 60 % or more by 2020			1
" we do n't really think that when we use our @entity164 or @entity165 that somewhere there is a computer doing something , " @entity128 said			0
" when i do a @entity66 search , somewhere there is a computer processing that			0
and that computer needs electricity			0
it needs someone to look after it			0
" it greenwash ? but not everyone is convinced that moving data centers to these icy climates is good for business -- or the environment			1
@entity184 of specialist it publication @entity185 recognizes the potential environmental and cost benefits but highlights numerous circumstances where storing company data far away from headquarters or operations would n't be practical or cost effective			0
big financial institutions require servers close to their core operations as they regularly perform trades where prices can change over a fraction of a second , @entity184 said			0
if a signal from a trading desk in @entity204 or @entity205 had to travel all the way along a cable to @entity2 to confirm a trade , vital milliseconds could be lost			0
" for companies like @entity16 or even @entity66 that kind of latency difference ( the time between a button being pressed and that action occurring ) is negligible , " @entity184 said			0
the data still moves at an extremely rapid pace			0
" ( but ) a financial services company may have a physical location requirement where they want servers to be close to trading engines " because of this			0
then there are things like data protection laws that mean certain types of information like medical records or government data must be stored within particular jurisdictions			0
" in the @entity231 world there is mistrust ( from people ) in having their data held outside of their country , " @entity184 added			2
professor @entity237 , chair of the @entity238 at the @entity239 is even more cautious as to the benefits of storage units in these parts of the world			0
he points out that while cooling can be cheap and use less electricity near the @entity104 for now , new server technologies are becoming more efficient and less power intensive			1
this could eventually mean it becomes equally cost effective to house data centers closer to business hubs and centers			1
" they ( locations in the likes of @entity2 , @entity68 and @entity76 ) say they are attractive because they have a lot of spare power that they want to sell			0
" they 've lost industries like paper and aluminum and have an excess of power ( and ) data centers appear to be a very high revenue load			1
" some companies are attracted to the corporate social responsibility thing and want to get @entity140 off their back			0
" " ( but ) most clients wo n't go there because they want to build their data centers where they want their data centers			1

some companies have begun operating large data centers near the @entity104
the area is attractive because of its low electricity prices and high levels of renewable energy
internet related activity accounts for an ever increasing share of the world 's energy usage
