-- @entity1 fears the weather could have a huge impact on the @entity5 @entity4 as his @entity7 team try to haul back @entity9 's lightning start to the season			1
@entity1 emerged victorious at the @entity11 in 2009 when the race had to be cut short due to torrential rain , and he went on to clinch the drivers ' championship at the end of that campaign			1
the @entity19 @entity7 driver finished sixth in the season - opener in @entity21 two weeks ago , as reigning world champion @entity22 drove from pole to flag to secure an impressive victory for @entity9			1
and @entity1 thinks whoever handles the inclement weather best in @entity28 will stand a good chance of claiming the checkered flag			2
he told @entity35 's official website : " it is a fun place to race and the weather can really play a big part here , especially with the four o'clock start , it is pretty much on the dot when it starts raining			1
" it makes it tricky for every team in the pit - lane and every driver to really understand the conditions and to make the right call			0
" only 33 laps were possible when @entity1 won in 2009 as thunderstorms and failing light made racing too dangerous			1
drivers also have to contend with the humidity in @entity5 and @entity1 has been training in @entity52 for the past week to prepare for the tough conditions			1
he told @entity19 newspaper @entity55 : " with the heat and humidity , and with it being a very tough circuit on tires , then we are going to see a very different race to the last one in @entity21			2
" then you chuck the weather into it and it 's going to be absolute madness			0
it will still be good , and we 're all looking forward to it because you never really know what 's going to happen			0
" @entity1 might well have improved on his sixth place in @entity21 but for a tussle with @entity71 's @entity70 , which resulted in a drive through penalty after he overtook the @entity74 illegally			0
but the 31 - year - old thinks overtaking will be far easier in @entity5 , with the help of the @entity78 ( which helps cars boost speed in passing situations )			2
he said : " it is one of those circuits where you can really have a good tussle as corners flow into each other			0
i think with the @entity78 it is going to make overtaking a lot easier than it was in @entity21			0

@entity1 says the weather could play a big part at the @entity5 @entity4
torrential rain caused the 2009 race to be called off after only 33 laps
@entity1 won that rain - hit race on his way to 2009 drivers ' championship
@entity19 @entity7 driver also thinks humidity will be a *factor* for drivers
