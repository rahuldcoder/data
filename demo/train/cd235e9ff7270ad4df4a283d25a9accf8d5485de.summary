-- where there should be excitement there is trepidation			2
where there is hope , there is also fear			2
@entity9 expects -- but what it also anticipates is a night of high drama , tension and nails being bitten until they are no longer visible to the human eye			1
when @entity16 's side take to the turf at the iconic @entity18 , the ' @entity19 ' , it will attempt to secure a victory which guarantees a place at next year 's @entity22			1
one win is all that separates @entity9 from challenging the world 's best in @entity25 and yet it still seems so far away			1
perhaps it 's not difficult to understand given the country 's history and that painful night 40 years ago when @entity9 faltered in such agonizing fashion			1
as on tuesday , the opponent will once again be @entity32			1
it was @entity32 and their goalkeeper , @entity36 who was infamously labeled a ' clown ' by former @entity38 and @entity40 manager @entity39 ahead of the qualifier on october 17 1973 , who proved the scourge of the @entity9			1
indeed , it was the @entity45 who had the last laugh -- claiming a 1 - 1 draw to progress to the 1974 @entity22 finals and leave @entity9 desolated			1
forget that @entity32 only had two efforts on goal to @entity9 's 36 or that the home side hit the woodwork twice and had four efforts cleared off the line			1
instead , that night is remembered as one of the most depressing in the history of @entity60 football			0
once again it is @entity32 , which will be roared on by more than 18,000 fans , which stands in @entity9 's way -- a proposition which is enough to make @entity9 manager @entity16 slightly nervous			1
" i 'm a worrier			0
i think anyone who works in football is a worrier , " @entity16 told reporters			0
" it wo n't be my best night 's sleep because at the moment all of my waking thoughts are around @entity9 versus @entity32			1
" on the other hand , i have great faith and trust in the players			0
i do n't think i can be putting a stronger bunch of players , a more confident bunch of players , onto the field			0
" but football is not a science			0
if it was a science and based on logic and science , i think we would be 99 % there			0
" but it 's not , it 's a game and things can happen in games that you do n't really want to happen and that 's what makes you worried			0
" it 's not that you are worried the team is not capable , it 's just that you are worried something untoward might happen			0
" @entity9 has performed inconsistently during its qualifying campaign , holding @entity99 to draws on two occasions , while also finishing level away in @entity32 and @entity102			1
until friday 's 4 - 1 win over @entity102 , it had only managed to defeat minnows @entity105 and @entity106 -- a statistic which has left @entity36 unimpressed with @entity9 's current generation			1
" back then they ( @entity9 ) were one of the world 's best teams , probably even the best , " @entity36 told @entity109 " now @entity9 is weak , weak but they 're not falling below a certain level			1
they could have qualified already , like the @entity116 or @entity117 , but they 've drawn too many games " they ( @entity9 ) are still among the world 's best , but for sure now they 're not in as good form as 1973			1
" but , objectively speaking , they 're the best team in the group			0
" something just is n't right with @entity9 these days			1
all the players are fantastic but during a game -- i mean individually these players are nearly the world 's best -- when they play together something 's off with the communication , it 's just not there			2
" @entity9 last failed to qualify for a major tournament in 2008 when it missed out on the @entity135 finals following a 3 - 2 home defeat by @entity137			1
that defeat signaled the end of @entity141 's reign as national manager and left a deep and painful mark which resurfaced when @entity9 was humiliated 4 - 1 at the @entity144 in @entity145 by @entity146			1
should @entity9 fail to defeat @entity32 and @entity99 triumph over @entity105 then @entity16 's side will face the lottery of the playoffs			1
but with the @entity45 having failed to claim a competitive victory over @entity9 in 40 years , @entity16 is in confident mood			1
" history 's important when it comes to not making political mistakes but i do n't think it has any relevance in sport whatsoever , " added @entity16			0
" every game 's a new game and each @entity32 team that 's played @entity9 has been a very different team so , as far as we 're concerned , we 'll do our job against the @entity32 we will face			1
" @entity163 it is not just @entity9 which needs to gain a result to qualify -- defending champion @entity163 requires a draw from its final game to book its place in @entity25			1
@entity163 faces @entity170 knowing that should it slip up then @entity171 can steal top spot			1
but the chance of that happening is remote according to captain @entity175			0
" @entity163 did the job on friday ( by beating @entity180 2 - 1 ) and we do n't expect them to fail tomorrow , " he told a news conference at the @entity171 ahead the game with @entity178			1
" yes , we already have the playoffs next month in mind			0
" @entity171 could meet @entity185 in the playoffs unless @entity188 's side pull off a huge victory over @entity191 and @entity192 leaders @entity193 lose in @entity194			2
" @entity171 are the strongest we may face , " @entity188 told reporters after being asked about the prospect of the playoffs			0
" they are the only ones i do not want to face			0
" @entity198 in @entity199 , @entity198 can book its place at the @entity22 for the very first time with victory in @entity203			2
@entity198 sits top of the group alongside @entity206 with 22 points , but enjoys a superior goal difference			2
@entity206 faces bottom side @entity209 in its final game but @entity198 manager @entity212 , a former international striker who played for @entity213 in the 1982 and 1990 tournaments , is confident of success			0
" we are awaiting the game with impatience , " he told reporters at @entity218			0
" the most important thing is that nobody is suspended or injured and we have had a good rest after beating @entity209			0
" @entity225 @entity225 is preparing itself for " the most important game we have ever played " according to captain @entity228			2
the nation has never competed at a @entity22 but can clinch a playoff spot with victory in @entity232			1
a draw or defeat would be good enough as long as @entity235 do not better their result when they face group winners @entity240			0
" we are young and do not scare easily , " @entity241 midfielder @entity228 told the @entity243 website			0
" we have already put pressure on ourselves and now we just have to handle it			0
we have @entity232 on tuesday , which will be the most important game we have ever played			2
" the @entity232 will not give us anything , like we would n't give them anything			2
they have nothing to lose so they might play well , but we just have to think about our game , stay cool and everything will be ok			0
" @entity253 while the @entity117 cantered to top spot in @entity257 , the race for second place remains wide open			1
@entity253 is in pole position , leading @entity259 by four on goal difference going into the final matchday			0
but @entity253 faces the @entity117 while @entity259 hosts @entity262			0
should @entity253 fail to defeat its visitors then @entity259 can pounce and snatch the playoff place			2
but if @entity253 and @entity259 both suffer defeats then @entity265 could yet sneak in through the backdoor			0
@entity269 @entity270 and @entity271 can both seal their places at next year 's tournament tuesday			2
a draw between the two teams will be good enough for both to progress			0
should there be a positive result then @entity280 could finish fourth with victory over an @entity283 side which has already qualified .			2

@entity9 will qualify for the @entity285 with victory over @entity32
@entity99 can take top spot if it beats @entity105 and @entity9 loses
world champion @entity163 expected to seal qualification
@entity225 can secure a playoff spot with victory in @entity232
