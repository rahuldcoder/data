-- the new report out of the @entity2 confirms what @entity3 have said all along : raising the minimum wage could cost hundreds of thousands of jobs			1
under normal circumstances , this would be a devastating blow to the @entity9			2
but these are exciting times			0
now , evidence of one thing from nonpartisan sources can be mined and manipulated to read as evidence of the opposite			0
earlier , when the @entity2 said the @entity17 could make 2 million @entity18 less likely to seek work , that was spun by the left as : @entity17 releases 2 million workers from the pressures of " job lock			2
" the minimum wage report is also being spun			1
in the moments after the report was released , @entity9 were already pulling the " good " bits from the report to tout the strength of their prior arguments			2
both sides do that , of course			0
but the problem with this is that the " good " talking point @entity9 are celebrating is one that was never questioned			2
the " revelation " that raising the minimum wage to $ 10.10 an hour would increase hourly wages for millions of people hardly warrants the " i told you so " dems want to deliver			1
it more warrants a " no duh			0
" after all , is anyone truly surprised that paying people more money will mean they make more money ? where @entity9 ca n't get off so easy is on the news that raising the minimum wage will result in a loss of half a million jobs			1
although some will try to shrug that off -- such as @ benadgatemusic , who tweeted at me , " oh noooooo .03 % of the workforce ! nice concern trolling , @entity61 " -- most serious folks will recognize that 's no small number			0
but time and time again , @entity9 have insisted that raising the minimum wage will not result in less hiring despite everything you or i have ever learned about supply and demand economics			1
@entity78 , for example : " the great preponderance of the evidence from these natural experiments points to little if any negative effect of minimum wage increases on employment			2
" @entity80 , for another : " it has been raised consistently , and it has never actually killed jobs			0
in fact , there has been no relationship between raising the minimum wage and losing jobs			1
" president @entity90 : there 's " no solid evidence that a higher minimum wage costs jobs			1
" this puts @entity9 in a tricky position			0
instead of being a little less committed to an economic principle they should have known to be false , they doubled down			0
now they 're left explaining not only why raising the minimum wage is still a good idea but why they did n't seem to anticipate these findings			1
they can spin this all they want			0
and i 'll even throw them a bone -- the report also says that raising the minimum wage will reduce the number of people living in poverty by an estimated 900,000			1
that 's a good thing			0
the question we have to ask ourselves : would that be that worth the potential loss of 500,000 jobs ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity117 .			1

@entity119 : new @entity2 report showing minimum wage hike could cost jobs flummoxes @entity9
she says @entity3 has long held what @entity2 said ; dems are trying to spin hike as poverty - lowering
@entity2 says raising minimum wage could indeed take 900,000 people out of poverty , she says
@entity117 asks : is doing that while potentially losing 500,000 jobs worth it ?
