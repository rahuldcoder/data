-- @entity1 , a cancer survivor , has worn a urostomy bag for the past three years			2
yet , he says , little could have prepared him for his recent airport pat down , when an officer broke the bag 's seal and urine spilled out " onto my shirt and down my pants			2
" " i 'm a good @entity10			2
i know why we 're doing this , and i understand it , " @entity1 told @entity0			0
" but this was extremely embarrassing , and it did n't have to happen			0
with educated @entity17 workers , it would n't have happened			1
" with the height of @entity20 holiday travel the next two days , the @entity17 is trying to strike a delicate balance between ensuring the safety of the traveling public and not invading people 's privacy rights			1
but the screening raises an array of questions from health - care professionals : are @entity17 officers trained to deal with patients like @entity1 who may have medical conditions ? what about the elderly and others with hip replacements and similar ailments ? will cancer patients have to take off wigs ? how is the @entity17 dealing with pat downs of children ? what about people with mental illness ? the @entity17 says it has taken all of these concerns into account -- that children are not to be separated from their parents if pat downs are deemed necessary and that travelers with medical conditions should be treated with " the dignity , respect and courtesy they deserve			1
" watch : cancer survivor accepts @entity17 apology " our program covers all categories of disabilities -- mobility , hearing , visual and hidden , " the @entity17 says on its website			1
" as part of that program , we established a coalition of over 70 disability - related groups and organizations to help us understand the concerns of persons with disabilities and medical conditions			1
" @entity75 , a psychologist at the @entity76 in @entity77 , says he advises anyone traveling right now to come mentally prepared for the unexpected			0
" go in with an expectation that this is going to happen , and go in with the expectation that you 're going to be the one singled out to go through a pat down , " @entity75 says			2
by doing that , people " can take more control of the situation			0
" he says people with medical conditions should also carry notes from their doctors			2
if a tense situation does arise while being screened , passengers should think about the big picture , he says			0
" there is a larger purpose to this trip that has nothing to do with the @entity17 and nothing to do with the government			1
and the purpose is : you 're visiting people you love			0
" the @entity17 has said the ramped - up use of pat downs and full - body scanning is necessary to prevent weapons and explosives from getting aboard planes			1
the @entity110 on monday said the process is evolving and that the government is taking into account the public 's concerns			1
" the evolution of the security will be done with the input of those who go through the security , " @entity110 press secretary @entity116 said			1
recent polls have shown most @entity10 support the measures , and a periphery glance at airports nationwide shows that the vast majority of travelers are dealing well with the extra scrutiny , even if it makes them uneasy at times			1
dr. @entity129 , the head of oncology at the @entity132 , says the extra scrutiny raises concerns for cancer patients , who could have metallic dishes for chemo placed under their skin , external catheters or other necessary medical devices on their bodies			1
" you can imagine during a pat down , you 're feeling this piece of metal under somebody 's skin			2
if you do n't know what it is , then it 's going to create a lot of problems for people , " she said			0
doctors must be more aware of when their patients are traveling and write notes explaining their conditions , she says			1
most of the time , though , " patients only think about it after they 've had a terrible experience			2
" a doctor 's note also carries a demoralizing stigma			0
" you want to go on vacation and forget you have cancer , " @entity129 says			2
" it 's just one more reminder of how different you are from the rest of the population			0
" another area of concern is the pat down of children			1
@entity176 , a psychologist at @entity177 , has simple advice for the @entity17 : have officers trained to deal with children on shift at all times , and always have the parent or guardian undergo a pat down first , in front of the child			1
" why not let the child see the parent go through it , that it 's no big deal , that it 's fine , " @entity176 says			0
he says it 's simple and practical advice , but he 's doubtful any of it will be used			0
after all , he says , it 's big government			0
" not only does it not use common sense , it does n't move that quickly			0
" to the agency 's credit , @entity17 administrator @entity201 called @entity1 to apologize monday after he learned of the incident			1
the two had a cordial conversation , and @entity1 even shared some advice			0
" he asked me what i thought , " @entity1 said			0
" so i talked to him -- that i really do n't believe that they 've been trained as well as [ they could ] to handle medical conditions			0
