a @entity1 judge has ordered the state attorney general 's office to stop pursuing criminal charges against @entity4 while a lawsuit related to prostitution ads on the popular classifieds site makes its way through the courts			1
@entity1 attorney general @entity10 has threatened criminal action against @entity4			1
in statements to the media and on his web site , @entity1 attorney general @entity10 has accused @entity4 's operators of not doing enough to eliminate ads soliciting prostitution in accordance with an agreement struck last november with 40 states attorney generals			1
earlier this month , @entity10 sent a letter to @entity4 ceo @entity22 accusing the site of failing to " install sufficient safeguards " to prevent it from being used " as a vehicle to advertise or solicit prostitution			2
" @entity10 set a deadline of 5 p.m.may 15 to permanently remove portions of the site " allowing for the solicitation of prostitution and the dissemination and posting of graphic pornographic material " or face criminal prosecution			0
in response , @entity4 filed a lawsuit on wednesday seeking to prevent @entity10 and his employees from charging the site with crimes related to the ads , claiming that to do so violates @entity4 's @entity42 and @entity43			1
the site also alleges that @entity10 's threats of prosecution violate the @entity46 , which states that no " provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider			0
" on friday , judge @entity54 granted @entity4 's request for a temporary restraining order preventing @entity10 and his employees from " initiating or pursuing and prosecution against craigslist or its officers and employees in relation to content posted by third parties on @entity4 's web site " until the court rules on the merits of the site 's lawsuit			1
@entity4 's lawsuit cites an interview @entity10 gave to @entity71 on monday , in which he likened the site " to a hotel or motel owner that knows prostitution is going on on their premises and fails to do anything about it especially after having been told			2
" the lawsuit contends that , because the site relies on posters for content , @entity10 's threats leave @entity4 with no choice other than to shut down its @entity1 section or face criminal prosecution			1
@entity4 's says that since november , the @entity87 , @entity88 - based company has undertaken significant good faith measures to cut back on prostitution - related ads , accounting for an 80 percent reduction in ads in its erotic services subcategory in @entity95 cities			2
some of the measures included asking posters for credit card number and telephone verification , implementing keyword filtering , and shuttering the erotic services section altogether , the web site claims			0
in its place , the site established an adult section , where , in addition to the previous measures employed , the ads are also manually reviewed to ensure compliance with the site 's @entity109 , resulting in just 40 ads in the section as of may 18 , the lawsuit claims			0
" the defensive legal action @entity4 has taken against the solicitors and my office is good news			0
it shows that @entity4 is taking the matter seriously for the first time , " @entity10 said in a post on his web site on may 20 , the day the lawsuit was filed			2
" unfortunately , we had to inform them of possible state criminal violations concerning their past practices to produce a serious response			0
we trust they will now adhere to the higher standards they have promised			0
