-- the @entity2 's @entity1 recently gave president @entity3 his " @entity5 in @entity6 " award			1
indeed , @entity1 wrote that there was a growing sense among the public that " @entity3 simply is n't up to the job to which he was elected twice			1
" but while it 's hard to argue that @entity3 has not had a difficult 12 months , the notion that this president is somehow done or a lame duck just does n't feel quite right			1
the fact is the office of the president is still the most dynamic change agent in our political system			2
and unlike @entity22 or the @entity23 , which go in and out of session , the president is on 24/7 , with significant power at his disposal , a point underscored by recent initiatives on immigration , climate change and @entity31			2
" my presidency 's entering the fourth quarter , " @entity3 said in a press conference friday			1
" interesting stuff happens in the fourth quarter , and i 'm looking forward to it			0
" that 's particularly the case on foreign policy , where presidents usually go when they 're stymied at home			0
and while @entity3 is clearly not the transformative foreign policy hero his supporters hoped he would be , neither is he the appeaser in chief his detractors claim			1
so , six years into his presidency , how is @entity3 's foreign policy shaping up , and what can we expect in his final two years ? he 's the anti-terrorist in chief @entity3 's base may have wanted ( and expected ) a kinder , gentler leader when it came to the policy of killing @entity58 's enemies abroad			1
instead , the president doubled down in @entity60 in 2009 , had @entity61 killed , dismantled much of @entity62 central and has used drone strikes with a frequency and lethality that makes him look like @entity67 on steroids			1
the raw numbers speak for themselves : as of november 21 , the @entity58 had conducted 500 targeted killings ( about 98 % of them with drones ) , " which have killed an estimated 3,674 people , including 473 civilians , " according to the @entity73 ' @entity72 , citing @entity75 numbers			2
about 50 of these were authorized by @entity67 , and some 450 and counting by @entity3			1
the president may have declared in may 2013 that the global war on terror is over			2
but there 's no reason to believe that the trend line on specific counterterror attacks will go anywhere but up			0
indeed , @entity86 and the war against @entity88 is proving to be a new frontier			0
he 's no nation - builder @entity3 was determined to pull @entity58 forces out of @entity60 and @entity92 and end @entity58 's combat role there			1
that is n't likely to happen by the time he leaves the @entity95			0
indeed , it 's possible by 2016 you might even see special forces expand their numbers in @entity92 and enter @entity86 , too			0
but what the president has done is to refrain from illusory efforts at using @entity58 forces to reconstruct @entity92 or @entity60 , let alone @entity86			1
if you want to understand @entity3 's policies on @entity88 and the reintroduction of @entity58 special forces into @entity92 , it 's best to look at them as significant counterterrorism operations designed both to enable the @entity58 to hit targets and to train and equip local allies to do so			1
but the reality is that @entity3 is determined not to be drawn into another trillion - dollar social science experiment to see whether he can put the @entity92 , @entity60 and @entity86 @entity115 back together again			1
even when it comes to @entity86 , the president has been reluctant to establish " no - fly " zones to neutralize @entity120 's air power and create sanctuaries for training opposition forces			2
indeed , the massive deployment of @entity58 ground forces or billions in assistance to those bottomless money pits are red lines that this president is unlikely to cross in the next two years			0
he 's a true believer in engagement when @entity3 said back in the 2008 campaign that he was prepared to engage @entity58 's adversaries , he really was n't kidding			1
the president is a committed internationalist with global sensibilities -- and probably far too invested in the power of diplomacy as the talking cure			1
last year , using secret diplomacy , @entity3 started a process of negotiation on the @entity143 nuclear issue and normalization efforts with @entity31 that he hopes will produce real change			1
he all but admitted in his press conference last week that change will be slow , but he reaffirmed his faith and belief in the power of engagement			0
but belief in significant change in authoritarian states such as @entity31 and @entity143 really represents the triumph -- at least for the moment -- of hope over experience			0
there 's not a whole lot of evidence to suggest that real transformation ever occurs in these societies when driven from the outside -- it did n't in @entity165 , @entity166 or @entity167			0
in @entity143 's case , buying time through diplomacy is premised on the highly arguable assumption that over time , @entity143 will somehow moderate its views and that the @entity143 public , now freed from sanctions and integrated into the international community , wo n't want to return to the old days and will press their leaders to avoid becoming a pariah again			0
but being one screwdriver 's turn away from a nuke may well be an @entity143 national priority that the president 's hope may not be able to alter			0
the next two years anyone watching the president 's press conference last week could feel just how energized he was			2
and it was n't just because he was going on vacation -- @entity3 can no doubt feel the pull of wanting to leave a positive legacy			1
right now , he likely believes the corner has been turned on the economy , and he may even feel things are breaking his way on foreign policy , too			0
after all , @entity88 ' momentum has at least been temporarily stalled , while the decline in oil prices has taken @entity166 president @entity198 down a notch or two			0
plus , if @entity202 elections due in march produce a more centrist government , @entity200 may start pushing @entity3 to get more engaged in the long - stalled peace process			2
yet challenges remain -- the possibility of a terror attack always looms at home , while @entity209 , @entity86 and @entity92 are proving to be ongoing thorns in the @entity58 side			0
and presidential luck can evaporate just as easily as it has appeared			0
still , as tough as 2014 was , and although 2015 brings with it a @entity215 - controlled @entity22 bound to take some wind out of his sails , one thing is abundantly clear -- driven by legacy and momentum , this lame duck president plans to be doing a lot of quacking next year .			2
