-- the thought of it is enough to make fair - weather golfers shudder in horror			1
but for hardier sporting souls , a sub-zero round in the @entity7 snow could be the perfect off - piste adventure this winter			1
welcome to a world where greens are " whites , " where snowplows -- not mowers -- groom fairways , and players swap snazzy pants and @entity19 sweaters for ski jackets and mittens			2
like normal golf , the goal remains frustratingly simple and the rules are largely the same as they are on grass			2
but the obstacles are somewhat different as players battle a strange playing surface and the cold			2
at @entity31 , a ski resort in @entity33 which started offering snow golf last year , players can expect a warm welcome but a decidedly chilly round			1
" we are 250 kilometers to the north of the @entity38			0
it can be anything from zero degrees @entity46 down to -25 , but usually the average is around -10 , " says @entity39 , marketing and sales manager for @entity42 , the company which manages @entity31 's facilities			0
thin a ball at those temperatures and your poor hands may never recover			0
but for most the experience is a happy one , @entity39 says , with players enjoying clean , crisp air under frequently blue skies while mastering the art of driving , chipping and putting on snow and ice			1
@entity31 's winter golfers tread the same path as summer guests , playing the route of a long - established grass course beneath			1
" summer golf has been here since the 1930s , but we wanted to do something for the wintertime , " explains @entity39			2
" we have nine holes and we use snowplows that we usually use on the slopes ( to smooth the course )			0
" visitors pay 350 @entity76 ( around $ 50 ) for a round , which includes club hire and balls			2
tee times after dark are also available thanks to glowing golf balls -- and night golf also lets players witness one of nature 's most magnificent spectacles up close			1
" it 's very , very magical if you catch the @entity91			1
we are one of the best places in the world to watch them , " @entity39 says			0
the @entity94 can be seen frequently in @entity33 during the winter , but sadly the opportunities to get stuck into snow golf are more limited -- the course is only open for three weeks in march			1
" we want to keep the ' whites ' in the right condition to ensure a good standard of play , " says @entity39			0
@entity31 joins a long list of @entity105 destinations which host snow golf events			1
@entity108 in @entity109 , @entity107 will welcome entrants to the 35th @entity111 later this month , and in march patrons of the annual @entity114 and @entity115 tournament will reconvene on @entity116 in @entity117			1
other annual events are scheduled to take place in @entity120 and @entity121 , but 2014 will not see the return of the @entity123 in @entity124 , @entity125 which has , since 2009 , fallen foul of the weather			0
" global warming has made it more difficult to arrange the event as we ca n't rely on ice being formed on the fjord of @entity124 -- the place where the event used to take place , " @entity128 of @entity125 told @entity0			0
happily for @entity31 , there have been no such issues with the weather so far and plans are in place for a weekend of competitions in late march , with the @entity144 forming the centerpiece			0
