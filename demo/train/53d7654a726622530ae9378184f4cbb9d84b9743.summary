-- when is bug spray more than just bug spray ? when it 's a compound that , according to researchers at @entity5 , is thousands of times stronger than @entity7 , works on many different insects and could very well save lives			1
scientists at the school say they 've developed just such a repellent			1
known merely as @entity13 for now , they say it works not just on mosquitoes , but also ants , flies , moths and a host of other bugs that , at best , are a nuisance and , at worst , carry deadly diseases like malaria			1
in fact , the project began as an effort to curb malaria , which will probably be contracted by as many as 500 million people this year , said @entity29 , a professor in the biological science department at @entity5 in @entity31			1
but researchers soon discovered the chemical compound they 'd created could have wider uses			0
" it turns out if we found the world 's greatest mosquito repellent , no one would care , " @entity35 said			1
" so we needed to find something that would work against all insects			2
" the trick , @entity35 says , was taking the way bug spray as we know it works , then doing the exact opposite			1
most commercial insect repellents target the bug 's olfactory system -- the way it smells -- to make it harder for them to find us and consider us as targets for a meal			1
" we decided to take a more aggressive approach and , rather than turn off the mosquito 's olfactory system , we could look for something that would turn it too far on , to see if we could design a new generation of insect repellents based on overloading their smell system , " @entity35 said			1
" they hate , just like we hate , overstimulation			0
they will move away from too much smell			2
" the researchers , who were funded in part by a grant from the @entity71 , say that , so far , @entity13 has worked on every insect they 've tested it on			2
that widens the possibilities for it			0
potential uses range from shooing away bugs that eat crops to a commercial product that can be used to keep pests out of the home			2
but the original goal , helping prevent a deadly disease that , according to the @entity84 killed more than 660,000 people in 2010 , remains foremost for @entity29 and his team			0
" our hope is that we 're able to help develop a product that can be sold for profit in the developed world , and use that profit to leverage distribution in the developing world , " he said			0
" our hope is that every time we spray on a mosquito repellent here in @entity99 , we 're subsidizing malaria reduction in @entity101 and @entity102			2
" the team has patented the compound			0
but there 's no word yet on when it might hit the shelves			0
for now , they 're doing tests to make sure it will be safe for people to use			0
" so far , we do n't see any toxic effects , " @entity29 said .			0

an insect repellent from @entity5 works on mosquitoes , ants and other bugs
they say it 's thousands of times more powerful than @entity7
it works by *flooding* the bug 's system of smell
they 've filed for a patent , but testing needed before it hits the *market*
