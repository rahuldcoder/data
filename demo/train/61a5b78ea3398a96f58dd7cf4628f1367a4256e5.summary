former sen. @entity0 , @entity1 , said this week that the growing threat towards @entity4 religious freedom by the government could lead to " @entity7 persecution , " similar to how the oppression of @entity9 and @entity10 evolved over time under @entity11			1
arguing that the rise of the @entity11 regime happened in a stable country where it was not expected , @entity0 said that a similar situation could occur in the @entity4 where , according to @entity0 , religious liberties are " under direct assault " for the first time in history			1
" @entity11 , prior to the @entity23 getting there , was a very religious country , " @entity0 said in an interview with the @entity22			1
" it was a @entity7 country			0
it was a very sophisticated country			0
" " the idea that you can have this kind of persecution take place over a period of ten years -- where you go from @entity10 -- jews , obviously , but also @entity10 -- being not just persecuted but put to death -- was unfathomable , " he said			0
" it was unfathomable to them that ( in ) a country like this , this could happen			0
" while the former presidential candidate did acknowledge that persecution in @entity4 is " fairly mild " compared to what 's going on in other parts of the world , he warned that it is still dangerous because " it 's something that grows over time			2
" " it starts in a gradual erosion , " @entity0 said			2
" we 're not in a dire situation right now , but that does n't mean you ca n't get there			0
i would argue that there 's a certainty that we will get there if we do n't push back and defend our liberties			1
" " if we do n't nip it here , then things get a lot worse , " he continued			0
asked why such attacks on religious liberties exist in @entity4 , @entity0 said it is mostly a result of government overreach			1
" the government wants to tell you how to live your life , " @entity0 said , citing abortion and same - sex marriage issues			2
" you either conform to what the government says you have to believe in , or you 're going to lose certain privileges			0
" @entity0 discussed the topic as part of an interview about his new film , titled " @entity80 , " which is produced by a movie production company run by @entity0 called @entity82			2
the film , @entity0 says , highlights where religious persecution comes from , what it is about and why it is a danger to society .			1
