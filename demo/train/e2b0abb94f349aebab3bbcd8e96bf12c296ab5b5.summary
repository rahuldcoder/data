-- the former @entity3 employee at the center of a political firestorm said friday that president @entity6 did n't literally say he was " sorry " when they spoke thursday , but " by simply calling me , " she believed he was apologizing			1
@entity8 -- forced to resign from her job based on incomplete and misleading reports about a speech she gave in march -- also told @entity0 's " @entity15 " that the department official who asked for her resignation was only a " messenger			1
" and later friday , she had a " very emotional " reunion with the white @entity18 couple she referenced about in her now - famous speech			1
as for the @entity20 , @entity8 told @entity0 that it had had been trying to reach her since wednesday night			1
" my phone was full , could n't take any more messages			1
finally , i was on the way to the airport in an attempt to get home when i checked my messages and had received one from the @entity20 saying the president was trying to get in touch with me and give them a call , " she said			1
" i did that , and i had the conversation with him , and , you know , i feel good about that			2
" asked whether she was able to enlighten him about her work , she said they did n't have time to get into that			1
" but toward the end of the conversation , i told him i 'd love to have him come to @entity48 , " she said , adding that she would " take him around and show him some things			1
" " i could definitely bring the point home , " said @entity8 , who lives in @entity18			1
she said he did n't precisely say he was sorry			2
" i really did n't want to hear the president of the @entity55 say ' i 'm sorry ' to @entity8 , " she said			1
" i felt he was saying that in his talk just by simply calling me			2
i felt it was , in a way , saying ' i 'm sorry ' because he did n't have to do it			2
" the @entity8 controversy began after conservative blogger @entity63 posted a portion of the speech in which @entity8 spoke of not offering her full help to a white farmer			1
the original post indicated that the incident @entity8 mentioned occurred when she worked for the @entity3 , and news outlets quickly picked up on the story			1
however , the incident took place decades before she joined the department , and her speech in its unedited form made the point that people should move beyond race			0
in addition , the white farmer whom @entity8 mentioned has told reporters that @entity8 helped him save his farm			1
nevertheless , @entity8 was swiftly fired after government officials heard only the portion of the speech			1
when the full version of the speech was heard , she received apologies from the @entity20 , the agriculture secretary and the @entity93 , which criticized the edited remarks			0
on " @entity15 " on friday , @entity8 was asked about the " ability " of @entity6 , @entity55 's first black president , to discuss and deal with racial issues			1
" i guess because he 's a black president , for some reason , they felt you ca n't talk about issues that affect just black people , " she said			1
she said she believes that " the administration feels too that if they highlight issues of black people ... the country would perceive ( it ) as something negative			2
i know they probably have to struggle with that			0
but i think they 're wrong			0
i think they could do more to advance unity if they could promote a discussion from that level			0
" @entity8 was also asked about @entity117 , the @entity3 official who phoned @entity8 and asked for her resignation			1
" i know @entity117 , and i know , had she been given the opportunity to make a decision her on her own , we would n't be sitting here talking about this			2
so she was the messenger			2
i really truly do believe it was not her message , " she said			0
" @entity117 is a great person			0
i definitely want to see her be able to continue the work she was doing at @entity3			0
so i would hope that this attention on her would not cause them to do the same thing they did to me : boot her out			0
" @entity8 has received an apology for her firing from agriculture secretary @entity135			1
although she has n't received an apology from @entity63 , @entity8 said she is not sure she 's ready for that kind of a chat just yet			1
" he would really need to come and sit down with me and look me in the eye so that we could see if we could find a place -- i 'm not saying i would n't forgive him , but we would need to see if we could find a place for that to happen			2
" i do n't see it at this point			0
he has n't been willing			0
he has n't tried to apologize to me for anything he 's caused me to go through , " she said			0
@entity63 's website included corrections wednesday on two blog entries that included the video footage from @entity8 's speech			1
" correction : while ms. @entity8 made the remarks captured in the first video featured in this post while she held a federally appointed position , the story she tells refers to actions she took before she held that federal position , " said a notice added to one of the postings on @entity63 's biggovernment.com site			1
a shorter version appeared on another posting of the @entity8 video footage			2
the corrections did not mention the edited nature of the video he posted monday or the full context			0
@entity63 told @entity0 's " @entity173 : 360 " on thursday that he saw no reason to apologize : " what would warrant an apology ? ... i 'm not the one who threw her under the bus			0
" @entity8 had said that she was offered some type of civil rights position in the department 's @entity181 and that she was expecting to receive something official in an e-mail from the department			1
on friday , she did not address that issue or say she would accept the position			0
the edited @entity8 video initially brought condemnation from the @entity93 , which later retracted its statement and apologized to @entity8 after the context became clear			2
also , the farmer and his wife @entity8 was discussing , @entity194 and @entity195 , came forward tuesday , saying that they credited @entity8 with helping them save their farm and that she did not discriminate against them			2
on friday , @entity8 and the @entity200 held a reunion at a restaurant in the @entity204 , @entity18 , area			1
a @entity205 witnessed the get - together			0
@entity0 's @entity207 , who saw the reunion , said it was " very emotional			0
" " the interesting thing is watching them look at each other in the eye and talk to each other			0
there were no tears but only big smiles			0
it seemed very authentic , " he said			0
@entity207 asked the couple whether they 'd ever have to help save her as she saved them			0
" never in a million years , " @entity222 said			0
the @entity93 , which initially called @entity8 's statements " shameful , " said in a statement tuesday that it was " snookered by @entity225 " and @entity63			2
@entity63 's post was picked up by the @entity225 website			0
on monday , @entity225 hosts @entity228 and @entity229 played the edited clip on their programs			0
@entity228 , who had called for @entity8 's immediate resignation , apologized for his statements wednesday			1
also wednesday , @entity225 anchor @entity234 sharply criticized @entity63 's website as well as his network 's own coverage of the story .			0
