@entity0 firmly put to rest fears over his form and fitness with a straight sets demolition of big - serving @entity7 @entity6 sunday to reach the @entity9 quarterfinals			1
@entity0 came into the opening grand slam of the season short of match practice and survived an almighty scare when sick on court and taken to five sets by @entity17 @entity16 in the second round			2
but with each passing match , the world number three looks to be building momentum			0
he took just over two hours to see off 15th - ranked @entity6 7 - 5 6 - 1 6 - 4 on the @entity22			0
the @entity23 oozed confidence after his victory as he bids for his second @entity9 title			2
" after a tough period of time for me it 's a fantastic result and i 'm very happy with the way i played today , " he said in his courtside interview			0
" it was probably my best match here this year so that 's very important for me and very special			0
" @entity0 , beaten by @entity35 in a dramatic final in @entity37 last year , will face @entity40 seventh seed @entity38 in the last eight			2
@entity38 will doubtless prove a dangerous opponent and showed his intentions with a straight sets victory over @entity47 hope @entity45 in their last 16 clash sunday , but he has a 3 - 18 career record against @entity0			1
the route to the final in that half of the draw has been eased by the upset exit of second seed @entity55 to @entity56 of @entity57 friday			0
@entity56 looked set to build on those heroics when he took a two - set lead against the poster boy of the championships , 19 - year - old @entity62 , but the @entity47 teenager was made of sterner stuff			1
he fought back to level -- saving a match point in the fourth set -- and amid a mounting frenzy on the @entity69 took the deciding set 8 - 6 after over three and a half hours of riveting action			0
the 5 - 7 4 - 6 6 - 3 7 - 6 8 - 6 victory earned him a quarterfinal against two - time grand slam champion @entity73			1
the @entity76 star 's match with @entity78 @entity77 on the @entity22 was briefly interrupted by fans cheering @entity62 ' victory and there is a sure to be a partisan following for tuesday 's intriguing clash with a semifinal berth at stake			1
@entity73 had to dig deep to avenge his @entity87 defeat last year to @entity77 , rallying from 2 - 5 down in the fourth set before closing out a 6 - 4 6 - 7 6 - 3 7 - 5 victory			1
in the women 's singles , @entity89 and @entity90 set up their eagerly - awaited quarterfinal clash with contrasting victories sunday			1
second seed @entity89 was rarely troubled in dispatching 21st seed @entity96 of @entity97 , 6 - 3 6 - 0 , while @entity98 struggled to defeat @entity99 of @entity100 6 - 1 5 - 7 6 - 2			1
@entity90 , who has had to cope with increased media attention after the " @entity103 " controversy , lost concentration to drop the second set , but was impressive in the opener and the decider			1
she has never beaten @entity89 , one of her inspirations but came close in the semifinals of last year 's @entity110			2
five - time grand slam winner @entity89 conceded as much when asked to reflect on the upcoming clash tuesday			2
" it was a really tough three setter			0
she 's been playing incredibly well -- confident aggressive tennis			0
i have a tough match ahead of me , " she said			0
third seed @entity118 of @entity100 later joined them in the last eight , battling past @entity122 @entity121 6 - 4 6 - 2 to earn a match with @entity126 10th seed @entity124 .			0

@entity0 into quarterfinals of @entity9
@entity90 and @entity89 to meet in women 's quarters
@entity62 wins five - set *thriller* against @entity56
@entity47 hope will play @entity73 in the last eight
