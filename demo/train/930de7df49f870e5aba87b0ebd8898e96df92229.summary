@entity0 -- a man who volunteered as a suicide bomber for a terrorist group intent on blowing up a @entity7 - bound plane was working instead as an intelligence agent for @entity9 , the @entity2 reported tuesday , citing @entity7 and foreign officials			1
the double agent departed @entity13 , traveled through the @entity14 and gave the bomb and information about @entity17 to the @entity18 , @entity9 intelligence and other foreign intelligence agencies , the newspaper said			1
the bomb , which was intended to pass undetected through airport security , was given to the @entity24 , which was poring over it , the newspaper said			1
the @entity2 , citing officials , said the agent works for @entity9 intelligence , which has " cooperated closely " with the @entity18 for years			1
the officials , who would not identify the man , said he is safe in @entity9 , the newspaper reported			1
citing a senior @entity7 official , the newspaper described the device as sewn into " custom fit " underwear and able to be detonated in two ways			2
that redundancy may have been an attempt to ensure that an attempt to blow up a jet over @entity42 in 2009 , which failed because the bomb did not detonate , would not be repeated			2
the primary charge in the latest device was high - grade military explosive that the @entity2 , quoting an official , said " undoubtedly would have brought down an aircraft			1
" a senior administration official told @entity1 that officials were debating whether to release photographs of the device to law enforcement agencies			1
on one side of the argument , @entity57 screeners and law enforcement might more easily identify any similar devices made as part of the same plot , the official said			2
but officials were reluctant to do so out of concern that the photographs would be leaked to the news media and that the would - be bombers would learn what law enforcement knows -- and might not know -- about the bomb 's workings			1
the news of the double agent might explain comments made earlier tuesday by @entity76 , the chief @entity77 counterterrorism adviser , who told @entity85 's " @entity84 " that @entity7 officials were confident they were in control of the situation leading up to the seizure of the improvised explosive device , or @entity83			1
@entity76 said that officials believe redundant security systems would have prevented any attempt at bombing a flight from succeeding , but analysts were studying the device to see whether security procedures should be adjusted			1
" we 're trying to make sure that we take the measures that we need to prevent any other type of @entity83 , similarly constructed , from getting through security procedures , " @entity76 said			2
the device investigators were studying is more sophisticated than were previous ones and represents a disconcerting advance in @entity17 bomb - making techniques , officials said tuesday			1
" it is a device similar to the underwear bomber of 2009 , but an evolution to that , " homeland security secretary @entity102 said			1
the device never posed an immediate danger to air travel or the @entity7 , she said			2
but lawmakers said more such devices may exist , and @entity113 chairman @entity112 , @entity114 , said the release of information about the device could complicate an effort to seal the long - term threat			1
" if something bad happens because it was leaked too early , that 's a catastrophe and it 's also a crime , " @entity112 told @entity1			2
news about the device became public on monday , about two weeks after @entity7 intelligence agents thwarted the plot after receiving a tip from @entity9 , a source familiar with the operation said			1
information from the double agent proved key to a @entity18 drone strike sunday in @entity13 that killed @entity131 , 37 , a senior operative of @entity17			1
@entity132 was a suspect in the bombing in 2000 of the @entity135 in @entity13			2
the vehicle he was in was hit by a drone strike in the @entity141 district in @entity143 province , @entity7 officials said			1
@entity145 's bomb - makers evolve , adapt " i was told by the @entity77 they are connected ; they 're part of the same operation , " the source familiar with the operation said			2
@entity150 hinted at the existence of another bomb effort in february , when he was asked whether the group had stopped exporting terrorism operations			2
" the war did n't end between us and our enemies , " he replied			2
" wait for what is coming			2
" @entity160 officials describe @entity17 as @entity17 's most dangerous affiliate			1
@entity7 rep. @entity162 , chairman of the @entity163 , expressed dismay that the news was public			2
" it 's really , to me , unfortunate that this has gotten out , because this could really interfere with operations overseas , " he said			0
" my understanding is a major investigation is going to be launched because of this			0
" officials have provided few specifics about the device			1
but @entity112 said it underscores @entity17 's continuing efforts to carry out terrorist attacks			0
" this is a device that was more sophisticated , had some fail - safes built into it , and it was something that concerns us because it tells us that they brought some very capable people together to build something , " he said			0
a @entity189 spokesman said authorities have " no specific , credible information regarding an active terrorist plot against the @entity7 at this time			1
" though the threat was foiled around the time of the anniversary of the raid that killed @entity197 , a second @entity7 counterterrorism official said the two were not related			0
president @entity200 was told last month about the plot , which " underscores the necessity of remaining vigilant against terrorism here and abroad , " the @entity77 said			0
@entity17 has been responsible for two of the most audacious attempts to target the @entity7 in recent years : the attempted @entity208 2009 bombing and a 2010 attempt to load bombs hidden inside printer cartridges onto cargo planes headed for @entity213			0
in both cases , @entity7 authorities believe the bombs were built by @entity216			0
both devices contained @entity218 , a white , powdery explosive that conventional " single - beam " x-ray machines are rarely able to detect			0
in 2009 , @entity216 outfitted his brother , @entity220 , with a petn - based underwear bomb in an attempt to kill prince @entity223 , a top @entity9 security official			0
the device killed his brother instantly but failed to kill its target			0
" we are not ready to say the threat stream is over , " a @entity7 official told @entity1			0
" we believe external plotting continues			0
" the investigation involves a number of countries and is " ongoing , " @entity162 , @entity232 - @entity231 , said on @entity1 's " @entity236			0
" he said the leadership of @entity17 was intimately involved in the plot			0
@entity112 told @entity240 's @entity239 , " i can confirm to you that , in fact , it was an @entity17 core group that was responsible for the development and procurement and financing and putting together this particular bomb			0
" as the hunt continues for the mastermind bomber , a @entity7 official said the assumption continues to be that @entity216 is training others in bombmaking			1
" they understand that @entity216 is going to be killed or captured one day , " @entity254 , the director of security and defense studies at the @entity257 , told @entity1			0
@entity254 had been briefed on @entity17 by @entity9 counterterrorism officials			1
" we 're talking about a new generation of very skillful bomb builders and very committed people			0
" @entity7 counterterrorism agencies have reached a similar conclusion			0
" i think the fear is not just that he 'll share his ability within his own circle , but rather more widely , and send it to other @entity17 - sympathetic individuals or organizations , " a senior @entity7 counterterrorism official told @entity1 in march			0
@entity13 's government has been fighting @entity17 for years with mixed results			0
@entity13 president vows offensive against @entity17 @entity13 authorities appeared miffed by the revelations of the foiled plot , saying that @entity0 had shared no information with them			1
" @entity13 has been a key ally to the @entity7 when it comes to fighting terror and cooperates in every way possible , " said a senior intelligence official in @entity13 who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation			1
" it 's very sad to know that the @entity7 did not share such critical intelligence information with @entity13			1
" the @entity7 can not win the war on terror alone , and intelligence sharing must be bilateral if it expects complete cooperation from @entity13			1
" " this was a key victory for us , " @entity162 said			0
" it also reminds us , though , that this war is not going to end in @entity299			0
... @entity145 has metastasized and morphed			0
and they are constantly attempting to find new ways to get at us			0
" @entity1 's @entity302 , national security contributor @entity303 , @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 , journalist @entity309 contributed to this report .			0
