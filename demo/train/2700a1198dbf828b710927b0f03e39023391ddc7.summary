-- it 's laughable to watch political prognosticators on the various tv shows weigh in on @entity5 's chances of becoming the next mayor of @entity7 , @entity8			1
if you trust any of them , you swear president @entity12 's outgoing chief of staff sees the position as a birthright that he is about to assume now that @entity15 is stepping down			0
folks , do n't buy the national media hype			0
as they say , all politics is local , and in this case , @entity5 has a long way to go before he can even think of moving into the fifth floor mayoral suite			2
@entity7 has long been called a city of neighborhoods , and as a resident of the city for the last six years , i have witnessed the territorial views of its residents live and with full effect			2
you name it , @entity7 is a city that is all about its neighborhood boundaries , and when you ask someone where they were born and raised , they are likely to give you the street address rather than just the @entity44 , @entity45 or @entity46			2
and those boundaries are often defined by race			0
with that being said , the issue of race will be a major obstacle for @entity5 , and not because he 's white and @entity52			1
first , it 's assumed that because he was a @entity7 congressman for six years , he 's well known in the city			1
yes , he did represent a @entity56 @entity7 district , but there are political strongholds all across the city , and he 's going to have to navigate them			1
the @entity60 commissioned a poll shortly after @entity15 announced he was n't seeking re-election , @entity5 placed fifth with 7 percent , within the margin of error			1
those topping the poll : @entity68 @entity67 ( 12 percent ) ; state sen. @entity69 ( 10 percent ) ; rep. @entity70 and rep. @entity71 at 9 and 8 percent , respectively			0
@entity7 has never had a @entity73 mayor , and @entity75 - @entity74 are still champing at the bit to revive the legacy of former rep. @entity78 , who stunned the nation with his election in 1983 when he bested a younger @entity15 and mayor @entity81 in the @entity83 primary			1
no one thought he had a chance because race has loomed large in heavily @entity83 @entity7 , and that was on full display when @entity89 eked out a victory that november against @entity91 , a white @entity92 who no one gave a shot and who some say subtly stoked the fears of white residents about a black takeover			2
his death in 1987 still resonates in the city , and with @entity15 reigning supreme for two decades , running everything from the schools to public housing to the rail system and the city college system , that enormous constituency sees this moment as an opportunity to finish what @entity89 started			0
african - americans dominate five of the city 's top 10 wards			0
and of the top 23 wards with registered voters , african - americans control a majority in 12			0
do n't assume that @entity5 , being a @entity118 , can easily win those			1
and if you 're one of those folks who think it 's wrong for me to focus on race , then you clearly do n't get @entity7 politics			1
it is an open secret in @entity89 that the @entity127 despises @entity5			2
a longtime caucus member told me that normally when they meet with the president , the chief of staff attends the meetings			0
but in the time @entity12 has been in the @entity134 , @entity5 did n't attend one meeting , and has always given a cold shoulder to black members of @entity138			1
and if you ask black political operatives , pollsters and insiders , they all have a " why - i - ca n't - stand - @entity5 " story			1
if he wants to win the mayor 's race , just having the public support of @entity12 is n't enough			1
he is going to have to deal with @entity147			0
@entity149 , @entity150 and @entity71 all three have massive ground troops , and if they are willing to rally around someone like the rev. @entity69 , also a state senator ( i attend his church , @entity156 of @entity7 ) , who can also pull white social conservatives to his side , @entity5 can forget about getting a significant share of the black vote			1
then there is @entity7 's @entity73 community			1
the population is substantial , but to count , they need to be registered voters , and @entity73 voters do not dominate a large portion of the 50 wards			0
yet winning their votes is vital to building a winning constituency			0
and with many blaming @entity5 for no progress on immigration reform over the last 18 months , and with @entity5 facing brutal scrutiny from @entity70 , a major immigration reform proponent , he 's going to have to do a lot of politicking in order to win			1
of course , there are the city 's white voters			0
you have the @entity186 liberals and the city 's blue - collar workers , who are strong union supporters			0
@entity5 has been at odds with unions in his time as chief of staff , notably over health care and the primary bid of @entity196 sen. @entity195 , and the national labor leaders will be quick to remind their supporters in @entity7 just how good a friend @entity5 was or was n't			1
@entity5 will also have to stare down @entity200 , a white man who won office with a multiracial coalition and has gained high marks , especially for refusing to follow through on serving residents with eviction notices from their foreclosed homes			2
if he is in the race , along with @entity211 @entity210 , a savvy politician from the @entity46 of @entity7 , they will be able to win a sizeable portion of the white vote , thereby leaving @entity5 on the outside looking in			1
@entity5 rightfully gets praise for his tough - as - nails approach to politics			2
but in a city that is used to @entity15 running the show with an iron fist for so many years , frankly , this might be the wrong time for someone with @entity5 's style to seek the city 's top post			2
we can expect a bruising battle in february for the job , and as many as 15 candidates could be on the ballot			0
the top two vote getters will go to a runoff , and there is a strong chance that @entity5 may not be one of those two			0
his run is certainly a gamble , and suffice it to say this could be the riskiest political decision he has ever had to make			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241 .			0

@entity5 is leaving @entity134 with *ambition* of becoming @entity7 's mayor
@entity241 says it wo n't be as easy as some people think
he says @entity5 faces a *challenging* field and has some *handicaps*
@entity241 : @entity5 will have to work to win confidence of @entity7 's black population
