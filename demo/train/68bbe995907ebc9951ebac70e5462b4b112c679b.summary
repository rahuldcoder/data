-- actor @entity1 , who spent the last 10 years portraying @entity2 , the awkward , nerdy pal to the trio of students at the center of the @entity7 films , is moving on			1
as the last of eight films based on the books by @entity11 hits movie screens across @entity13 , @entity1 spoke with @entity0 about his journey as @entity2 and how it has not just affected him , but prepared him for a career as an actor			1
@entity0 : @entity2 starts out as a pretty psychologically wounded character , and you have been able to portray his journey of personal growth			1
most people pay a lot of money to psychologists to make a journey like that			1
what life lessons have you learned from @entity2 ? @entity1 : oh wow			1
the great thing about @entity2 -- what message he conveys that @entity11 wrote for him -- was that you can have any kind of disadvantage at the start of your life and it does n't define you			1
you can still go on to be whoever you want to be			1
as long as you have friends around you and you have a belief in doing the right thing , you can go on to be a hero			2
it does n't matter what humble beginnings you came from			2
i think that 's really inspiring			2
i think that 's a really nice life lesson			2
@entity0 : what do you think fans like best about @entity2 ? what do they identify with ? @entity1 : it 's really the underdog success story of it all			1
everybody loves an underdog , but crucially , it 's the message that a lot of people can have a pretty lousy time at school			2
a lot of people struggle in their younger years and i think people can relate to that			2
and @entity2 shows that 's not the be all end all			1
you can still go on to do great things in your life			2
what i 've gathered from fan mail and meeting people is that that 's quite inspiring , and it helps some people get over bullying at school or whatever difficult problems they 're having in life			2
as an actor , that 's the loveliest thing in the world to think that something you 're doing , what your job is , is inspiring people			2
@entity0 : is there a difference between @entity92 and @entity13 fans ' reaction to @entity2 ? @entity1 : you know , it 's a very similar reaction only it 's different in terms of -- how do you explain it ? -- i guess @entity13 tend to be quite a lot louder			1
but the responses are the same with varying degrees of excitement			2
@entity0 : a lot of people are probably surprised by the man you grew into			2
your nerdy look in the films , even your slightly crooked teeth , were very endearing to fans , and you look quite different now			1
what has coming out the other end of @entity7 been like for you personally and professionally ? @entity1 : well , it 's a really exciting time to be honest with you			1
when the films finished i obviously had a degree of sadness about it all coming to an end			2
having done something that you 've loved so much for such a long time , it 's obviously going to be sad when it comes to an end			2
but it 's also an exciting time because for the first time in a decade , i do n't know what 's coming next			2
and really , it 's the opportunity now for me to show that i 'm not just @entity2 , there is more that i can do , and i really just want to sort of push myself			1
it 's a transitional period at the moment , and we 'll have to see what happens next			2
@entity0 : do you like the fantasy genre as an actor , or is there a different genre that inspires you ? @entity1 : genre is not something i particularly look at			1
i just want to be an actor -- in theater , on television , in film			0
i love the idea of being able to become somebody else , and it 's like being a child and never having to grow up			0
i can dress up in fancy dress and play make believe as a job and people pay me to do that			0
i never have to get old			0
but i would love to do something grittier			0
i 'd love to do sort of a war picture or a gangster film or something much more real life			0
but i ca n't begrudge the fantasy genre			0
i 'm a huge fan of " @entity168 , " " @entity7 " and " @entity169 , " science fiction , that kind of stuff			1
@entity0 : what 's your favorite memory from your total @entity7 experience ? @entity1 : i 've got two			1
one 's @entity7 related and one 's definitely not , but it came about because of @entity7			1
the first one , the @entity7 one , was my first week at work			1
it was in @entity183 in @entity184 , @entity185 , and it was the broomstick lesson when @entity2 gets on the broomstick and is flying around and crashing into walls			1
i just remember being so frightened of the whole process of being in this big , big film			0
and then i was told by @entity190 that the first scene i would be doing was all about me and i would be working with the stunt team			0
it was very nerve - wracking , but he put me at ease and made me relax , and it ended up being the most fantastic week			0
i remember being very excited for the next six months or so			0
little did i know that it would go on for another decade			0
and the other thing that i will never , ever forget is being able to meet sir @entity200 , which definitely came about because of @entity7 , and i 'll never forget that			1
he 's a personal hero of mine			0
@entity0 : has @entity11 let you know what she thinks of how you brought her character to life ? @entity1 : yes			1
and it 's obviously something i was really concerned about			0
@entity11 is just the most incredible author , and i 've loved her stories since i was a boy of 9 years old			1
i was so focused on getting it exactly how she imagined it in her head			1
and a couple times i spoke to her at premiers and she came to the studio and said , you know , i 'm doing it right			0
it 's exactly how she wanted it			0
and as a compliment you ca n't get much better than that			0
to have @entity11 say that , it was just the most amazing feeling			1
and she was so lovely			0
she mentioned it on the red carpet , as well , on [ last ] thursday in @entity230 , and it 's a nice thing to hear			0
it 's great for the fans to love what we do , but for @entity11 to enjoy it , too , it just means so much			1
@entity0 : what will you do now ? after a thrilling end to such a consequential pop culture event , many people might say , " i 'm going to @entity243			0
" where are you going ? @entity1 : i 've been doing theater for the past six months in the @entity92 @entity246 told me to do theater , he recommended theater , and so i did			1
and it was really a learning experience for me			0
i wanted to expand my ability , and i want to try and learn as much as possible and really add another string to my bow , if you like			0
i feel like i 've grown in confidence as a person and an actor in theater			0
it really is a foundation for all acting , whether in television or film			0
it really is where it all started			0
so i would not mind going back in the theater at all , but i 've got a couple of things that i 'm reading through at the minute			0
i 've got a meeting when i get back to @entity230 , as well , in a couple of weeks			0
i want to take what i 've learned in the theater and what i 've learned on @entity7 in the last decade and really just take it to the next level			1
forge out an acting career			0
and i 'm not focused on trying to better @entity7 , i 'm not focused on trying to get a leading man role , i just want to act			1
i very much see myself as a jobbing actor who needs to work , and so i just keep looking to get back on the wagon and keep working .			0
