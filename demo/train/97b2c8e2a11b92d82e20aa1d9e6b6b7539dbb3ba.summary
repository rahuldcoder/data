-- @entity2 voters have just rejected @entity3 , the ballot initiative that would have legalized marijuana under state law			1
where did @entity3 19 go wrong ? @entity3 failed in part because many proponents emphasized the wrong arguments for legalization			1
many advocates promised major benefits to @entity2 's budget because of reduced expenditure on marijuana prohibition and increased revenue from marijuana taxation			1
other supporters claimed that @entity20 drug violence would fall substantially			0
the budgetary benefits , while not insignificant , would have been small compared with @entity2 's fiscal mess			0
@entity20 drug violence is mainly associated with the cocaine and methamphetamine trades , as well as from marijuana traffic to other states			2
many voters sensed that @entity3 supporters were overreaching , and this made them suspicious of all the arguments in its favor			1
common sense should have recognized that since marijuana was close to legal already , @entity3 would not have had dramatic effects			1
@entity3 failed also because it overreached			1
one feature attempted to protect the " rights " of employees who get fired or disciplined for using marijuana , including a provision that employers could only discipline marijuana use that " actually impairs job performance			0
" that is a much higher bar than required by current policy			0
this provision allowed @entity3 19 opponents to claim that workplaces would become infested with impaired pot users			1
that assertion is not well - founded , but that is not the point			0
@entity3 19 did not need to address employee marijuana - testing in the first place			1
a more effective position for @entity3 supporters would have been that employee marijuana - testing should be unencumbered by state or federal law			1
that would allow employers to protect themselves and their employees against perceived risks from marijuana , thereby promoting support for legalization			0
a final problem with @entity3 is that it would only have legalized marijuana under state law , since federal law also bans marijuana			1
@entity74 attorney general @entity73 , moreover , announced just weeks before tuesday 's election that the administration would enforce the federal law fully even if @entity3 passed			2
this legal limbo would have kept the marijuana market underground , limiting tax revenue and continuing the ills of black market			2
this ambiguity also dimmed support by making state - level legalization feel like an empty gesture			0
so what is the path to legalizing marijuana in the @entity74 ? first and foremost , advocates must emphasize that in a free society , the burden of proof should be on prohibitionists to justify the interference with liberty that results from outlawing marijuana , a burden the prohibitionists have never met			1
any calm assessment of marijuana versus alcohol , for example , shows that alcohol is the substance with the greater potential for harm			0
ancillary benefits of legalization are naturally important : by eliminating the black market , legalization promises reduced crime and corruption , fewer infringements on civil liberties , better quality control for marijuana users , along with budgetary benefits			0
but these considerations are unlikely to convince the majority until more people agree that government should not interfere in the private decision to consume marijuana			0
marijuana advocates should also focus on federal law , in addition to or even instead of state law			2
legalization proponents have long despaired of affecting change at the federal level and assumed that state - by - state change would someday bring down federal prohibition			2
that position is understandable , and it has achieved some success , such as the decriminalization of medicalization of marijuana in many states			0
yet it 's hard to see the federal apparatus yielding ground without direct elimination of its authorization ; the stakes for those who hold this power are too high			0
@entity149 can also argue compellingly that no reasonable interpretation of the @entity151 justifies federal imposition of a marijuana ban			2
a final key to legalizing marijuana is to get conservatives , not just liberals , more involved			1
a number of well - known conservatives have advocated legalization , such as @entity160 , @entity161 , and @entity162 , but the general perception is that legalizers are " stoners , " acting mainly out of self - interest			0
yet legalization can appeal to conservatives , especially if the arguments emphasize freedom , personal responsibility , and the @entity151 , along with up - front clarity about the goal : legal production and use of marijuana for adults , whatever their motivations			1
past liberal efforts , such as medical marijuana , invite charges of hypocrisy and weaken support			0
marijuana can and should be legal , @entity185 19 's failure notwithstanding			1
but the strategy for achieving that end must change			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			2

@entity191 : @entity3 19 advocates did *n't* present right reasons for making pot legal
voters were wary of claims of dramatic positive change if it were legalized , he says
@entity191 advises advocates to argue pot prohibition interferes with individual liberty
another key to legalizing marijuana is to get conservatives involved , he writes
