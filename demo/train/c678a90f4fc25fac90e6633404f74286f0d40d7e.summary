-- @entity1 said a core group of states needed to press on with @entity5 integration to fight the eurozone crisis , a rebuke to @entity8 , @entity9 prime minister , who has called for more short - term crisis measures			1
only hours before mr @entity8 's visit to the federal chancellery , @entity12 's chancellor said nations " in a currency union have to move closer together " , reinforcing the shift to " a multi-speed @entity5 " which began with the introduction of the single currency			1
" we can not just stop [ the process ] because one or other does n't want to join in yet			0
" ms @entity1 seemed intent on highlighting what @entity22 perceives to be a contradiction between the @entity9 's refusal to sign up to strict new @entity27 fiscal rules and mr @entity8 's call for more intervention in the crisis -- a stance which has irritated many in the @entity12 capital			1
with @entity35 straining to recapitalise its banks and @entity38 reforms in doubt , @entity34 on wednesday signalled that mr @entity8 would use his @entity22 visit to urge ms @entity1 to take quick steps to pull the eurozone back from the brink of disaster			1
her meeting with mr @entity8 in the chancellery -- which included a good - humoured 90 - minute discussion with students -- came amid a chorus of calls for the eurozone , and @entity12 in particular , to do more to quell market turmoil			1
the @entity9 government has in recent weeks called for near - term measures including a bigger eurozone rescue fund to act as a firewall against financial market contagion , and jointly issued eurozone bonds -- ideas which the @entity12 government has repeatedly rejected as unnecessary as it pushes for longer - term fiscal integration			1
@entity62 , @entity9 chancellor of the exchequer , added to this drum beat on thursday morning when he said @entity35 banks should be given immediate access to the eurozone rescue fund , which can at present only disburse money to governments			2
@entity35 's vicious cycle with @entity72 , @entity73 president , also putting pressure on ms @entity1 to switch tack , the chancellor used her first television interview in weeks to emphasise her commitment to her plan to encourage eurozone governments to cede some fiscal power to @entity81			2
" we need more @entity5			0
we do n't only need monetary union , we also need a so - called fiscal union , " she said			0
" and most of all we need a political union -- which means we need to gradually cede powers to @entity5 and give @entity5 control			0
" the @entity12 government believes only a clear roadmap for eurozone integration will ultimately restore investor confidence			2
@entity22 is expecting @entity92 , @entity93 president , to make suggestions about a banking union at the next @entity27 summit at the end of june , with more proposals expected in december			0
with @entity35 free to make a request for emergency bank capital from the eurozone rescue fund , and the future of @entity38 in the hands of voters in mid-june elections , @entity22 sees no point in committing to new crisis - fighting tools at the moment			2
but the difficulties of persuading even like - minded countries to transfer sovereignty to @entity81 also became clear on thursday , when the @entity112 , usually a staunch ally , questioned ms @entity1 's call for some countries to integrate faster than others			1
@entity117 , finance minister , said " one of the fundamental causes " of problems in @entity38 , @entity124 and @entity35 was that the single currency had fostered economic divergence , not the promised convergence			0
" within a single @entity5 economic and monetary union , i do n't think it 's possible to have structurally different paths			0
" the @entity112 government is preparing for elections later this year in which parties on the far right and left have strongly rejected tighter @entity5 political integration , putting the government on the defensive over any delegation of political power to @entity81			0
ms @entity1 on wednesday took a big step towards securing swift parliamentary approval of the new @entity147 and the fiscal pact , when her @entity139 and the opposition @entity138 agreed outlines for a financial transaction tax , which they hope other eurozone states will adopt. as the fiscal pact requires a two - thirds majority in the @entity151 , @entity12 's lower house , ms @entity1 had to woo the @entity138 with a push for an @entity153 , which her junior coalition partner , the @entity155 , has long resisted			1
both @entity138 and free democrats on thursday said they backed a proposal by the finance ministry , which suggested using the @entity9 's stamp duty and @entity161 plans to introduce a similar tax as " a basis for a first step at @entity5 level "			2
the move could open the way for ratification of the fiscal pact and @entity147 by the end of june			0
