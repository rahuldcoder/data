@entity0 -- the commuter train that jumped its tracks in the @entity5 was barreling into a curve at nearly three times the posted speed when it derailed , killing four passengers , federal safety officials said monday			1
preliminary data from the event recorders aboard the train clocked it at 82 mph as it approached the 30 - mph curve , where the @entity19 and @entity20 rivers converge , @entity11 member @entity10 told reporters			1
the data show the engineer cut the throttle and slammed on the brakes , but those moves came " very late in the game , " @entity10 said			1
" this is raw data off the event recorders , so it tells us what happened			2
it does n't tell us why it happened , " @entity10 said			2
investigators questioned the engineer , @entity35 , and the rest of the train crew on monday			1
@entity35 told investigators he applied the brakes , but the train did n't slow down , according to a law enforcement official who was at the scene and is familiar with the investigation			1
but while the cause of the derailment has not yet been determined , investigators have seen no indication of brake problems , @entity10 said			2
all seven coaches and the locomotive came off the tracks in the sunday morning crash on @entity0 's @entity54 line			1
in addition to the four dead , at least 67 more were hurt			2
three remained in critical condition monday night , and 16 others were still hospitalized , hospitals told @entity1			1
the train 's recorded speed is not only far faster than the rated speed for the curve where the derailment occurred , it 's faster than the 70 mph posted for the section of track that led into the curve , @entity10 said			1
the force of the crash ripped apart the rails and a section of the track bed , leaving chunks of concrete strewn about the scene			1
@entity76 , a former deputy chief of field operations for the @entity78 , said the data is " uncannily similar " to a july rail crash in @entity81 that left 79 dead			1
" i would have to see all the data from the event recorder , " @entity82 told @entity1 's @entity83			2
" but clearly , from what has been captured , the train was overspeeding , and the request for emergency brake application comes too late for the train to be able to negotiate the curvature			1
" @entity10 said authorities will be looking at the engineer 's recent work history and will examine his mobile phone , which is now in the hands of authorities			2
in the @entity81 crash , a court found the engineer had been on the phone with railway staff when the train derailed			1
but a preliminary review has found no reason to believe @entity35 was using his phone at the time of sunday 's derailment , a senior law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told @entity1			1
in a statement issued monday evening , @entity0 gov. @entity111 said the data " makes clear that , as we suspected , extreme speed was a central cause of this crash			1
" " the lives that were lost yesterday are a stark reminder that protecting the safety of all @entity0 must be our top priority , " @entity111 said			0
" when the investigation concludes , we will make sure that any responsible parties are held accountable			0
my thoughts and prayers continue to be with the families of the victims of yesterday 's crash			1
" the @entity130 carried 15.9 million people last year			1
about 150 were aboard when the train derailed , authorities said			1
@entity135 sen. @entity134 said the speed report " sort of takes your breath away			0
" " for a train to be going 82 mph around that curve is just a frightening thought , " said @entity134 , @entity139 - @entity0 , who appeared at a news conference with @entity10			1
" the fact that it was going 82 mph even in the 70 - mph zones before the curve started raises so many questions and is scary			1
" @entity134 said the tracks appear to have been in good shape , and the preliminary indication is that signals were working properly -- " but it 's premature to blame anyone or anything right now , " he added			0
' it was just smoke ' the train was about 10 miles short of its destination , @entity159 's @entity158 , when it derailed on the approach to the @entity162 station in the @entity5			1
despite the high speed , surviving passenger @entity163 said she felt the wreck in slow motion			0
" i was nodding off , and the thing that woke me up was my own equilibrium , " @entity163 told @entity1 's @entity167 360			0
" i realized that my body was tilted very severely , and that woke me up -- and when i woke up and saw the entire cab of the train was tilted , i immediately woke up and realized that i was in the middle of a train crash			1
" the windows of the coaches broke out and then , " gravel came flying up in our faces , " said @entity163 , 26 , who was on her way to work at a @entity159 restaurant			0
she put her bag in front of her face to block the rubble as the car she was riding in flipped over and skidded to a stop with a thud			0
" i could n't see anything , " she told @entity1 's @entity190			0
" it was just smoke			0
" workers lifted the rail cars back onto the tracks on monday , and police determined no other bodies were trapped in the wreckage			1
@entity199 , who sent photos to @entity1 's @entity201 , called the scene " very surreal and very scary			0
" " it was a scene straight out of a sci - fi movie , " @entity203 said			0
cameras may have caught deadly derailment it 's not the first time a train jumped the tracks on that turn			1
a freight train derailed in the same curve in july , damaging about 1,500 feet of track , the @entity213 reported at the time			1
@entity217 , a former inspector - general for the @entity135 @entity218 , said investigators should take a close look at the sharp curve			2
" it has been there forever , but the fact that we 've had other accidents there means we have to look beyond just the fact that the train engineer said that brakes were not working , " she said			1
" we have to see if there 's additional issues concerning that track			0
" @entity10 said the agency would look into whether there was any connection between the july derailment and sunday 's crash , but both he and @entity0 gov. @entity111 discounted the possibility			1
" the curve has been here for many , many years , right , and trains take the curve every day , 365 days a year ... we 've always had this configuration			2
we did n't have accidents , " @entity111 said sunday			0
" so there has to be another factor			0
" authorities also are looking for video that may have captured the derailment , safety board spokesman @entity248 said			0
railroad officials have said there were no video cameras aboard the train			2
@entity10 said security cameras from a nearby bridge captured the train 's approach , but the image is small and obscured by a cloud of dust			2
video technicians in @entity264 will try to recover some usable imagery from the recording , he told @entity1 's " @entity267			0
" @entity269 inspects its tracks twice a week , spokeswoman @entity268 said			0
the most recent inspection found the track was " ok for normal operations			0
" she said the train was n't equipped with positive train control -- a high - tech system designed to slow down or stop trains to prevent crashes caused by human error			2
@entity281 said the railroad conducted routine drug and alcohol tests on crew members but has not released the results			0
@entity35 appeared coherent at the scene , and there was no indication he was intoxicated , said a high - ranking law enforcement official who is part of the investigation			2
@entity293 , general chairman of the union that represents @entity35 and the train 's conductors , said the crew members are also eager to find out what caused the crash and " make sure it does n't ever happen again			1
" " hopefully over the next day or two , there will be some kind of idea or closure , " he said			0
the victims the @entity213 identified those killed as @entity307 , 54 , of @entity308 , @entity0 ; @entity309 , 58 , of @entity310 , @entity0 ; @entity311 , 59 , of @entity312 , @entity0 ; and @entity313 , 35 , of @entity314 , @entity0			2
@entity309 did freelance audio and was headed into @entity0 to work sunday morning , said @entity316 , a town council member in the @entity318 community of @entity319			0
" he loved his family and did what was necessary to keep things afloat with his family			0
he was a great man , " @entity316 said			0
one of the survivors suffered a spinal cord injury that could leave him paralyzed from the neck down , said dr. @entity329 , director of the emergency department at @entity331 in the @entity5			0
the man is the father of a 14 - year - old boy who was released from the hospital sunday			0
" it 's hard to understand how they were sitting next to each other on the train , and the son walks away with minor bruises , and the father sustained such a severe injury , " @entity329 said			2
while patients with severe fractures could be released from the hospital monday , he said , they may require further treatment and mental health care after surviving the devastating accident			0
" for a lot of these people , the train was their way of commuting to work			1
i think a lot of these people are going to have to contend with getting back to normal life , " he said			2
" i think that 's going to be very difficult for them			0
" train crash victim was ' pure goodness , ' widow says @entity1 's @entity361 reported from @entity0			1
@entity1 's @entity362 , @entity363 and @entity364 reported from @entity365			0
