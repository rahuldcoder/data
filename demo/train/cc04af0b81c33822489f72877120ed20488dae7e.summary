-- by now , unless you live under a boulder large enough to block data signals , you know that @entity5 rep. @entity4 is embroiled in a scandal involving an extremely personal picture sent from his @entity9 account to a @entity11 college student			1
@entity4 says his account was hacked , but ca n't say " with certitude " if the picture is a fake			1
but what else does the story that has @entity17 all a-twitter reveal about everyone 's favorite microblogging service ? 1			1
@entity9 is very effective at spreading the news , but it ca n't control it			1
for @entity9 itself , the @entity4 story could n't have broken at a less appropriate time			1
the company 's ceo , @entity28 , and a large portion of its pr team were hunkered down at the @entity32 conference in beautiful @entity33 , @entity34 , preparing to launch -- of all things -- its new photo - sharing service			0
@entity28 deftly batted away questions about @entity4 with a " no comment			2
" but for a company that is anxious to prove its maturity , talking about ways to share pictures on @entity9 at a time when the most famous example of that is a lewd underwear snap could only have been frustrating			2
maybe this is a good time to launch @entity9 photo - sharing after all			1
reports emerged thursday that the mysterious sender of that photo may well have exploited a security flaw in @entity53 , a third - party photo - sharing service			0
the loophole would have allowed anyone to send a picture from @entity4 's account using tools no more advanced than e-mail			1
@entity53 has since disabled the e-mail feature			0
still , that 's a strong argument for sharing photos directly and securely from your @entity9 account -- which is exactly what @entity9 is launching			1
checking @entity9 on a friday night is the new normal			1
college student @entity68 , recipient of the offending tweet , wrote for the @entity70 that she first learned about it when logging into @entity9 on a friday night			1
if you think that 's unusual activity for a co-ed on a friday night , get with the 21st century			1
a dozen of @entity68 's friends had already seen the @entity4 tweet , she wrote			2
according to @entity9 tracking firm @entity79 , friday is the third - biggest day of the week for tweeting ( after tuesday and wednesday			1
) social media , it seems , is how we like to relax after hitting the books			0
account hacking is more common than you might think			1
if it turns out @entity4 's account was hacked , he can take comfort in one thing : it happened to one of his main detractors , @entity95 , too			1
in 2009 , followers of the network 's official @entity9 feed were puzzled to see a tweet about host @entity101 's sexual orientation , the result of an 18 - year - old hacker called @entity104 uncovering the account 's password			1
@entity95 was only the first in a series of @entity104 attacks on @entity9 accounts including those of @entity112 , @entity113 , the @entity114 , and @entity115 himself			2
little more than a year later , hundreds of accounts -- including the one owned by tech pundit @entity118 -- were hacked by a spammer looking to advertise a weight - loss product			0
there are plenty of things you can do to keep your account secure			0
@entity9 has spent years beefing up its security and dishing out advice on how you can help			2
the top tips : use a strong password with numbers and unusual characters ; use the more secure url " https://twitter.com / " ; be wary of links and e-mail phishing scammers that pretend to be @entity9 employees asking for your password			2
always double - check the person you 're tweeting			0
@entity68 's take on why @entity4 , whom she does n't know , may have tweeted at her ? because her name is alphabetically close to that of @entity146 , a @entity147 exotic dancer that @entity4 also followed on @entity9 until recently			1
it 's entirely possible , given that @entity9 auto - suggests who you might be trying to reach once you start typing their names			2
one false click , and that racy message intended for your spouse may be winging its way to your mom instead			0
@entity17 may be obsessed with @entity4 , but @entity9 users have already moved on			1
you might expect the @entity9 hashtag that denotes the scandal , " @entity165 " , to be popular right now			2
but you 'd be wrong			0
it is n't even in the top 10			0
beltway pundits and politicians may be talking about little else , but @entity9 's 200 million users have other things on their minds			1
the top trending hashtags in the @entity174 friday morning ? " # myperfectmorning " and " @entity175			0
social media can bring unwanted attention -- but mostly from old media			0
another sign that @entity9 users care little about the scandal : as of friday , @entity68 's account was being followed by less than 800 people			1
compare that to @entity184 , the tweeter who first noticed the @entity186 raid on @entity187 that killed @entity188			0
@entity184 's sudden fame gained him roughly 100,000 new followers			0
@entity68 's biggest beef is n't with anyone on @entity9 -- it 's with the @entity193 , which she alleges wrangled an interview out of her under false pretenses			2
social media is really hard to quit			0
@entity4 may be done talking about the scandal to reporters , but he has n't stopped tweeting			0
@entity201 's initial response to the scandal was to disable her accounts on @entity9 , @entity113 , and the question - and - answer social site @entity205			0
within days , however , she was back and tweeting up a storm			0
her new tagline ? " i ca n't believe i 'm back on @entity9			0
" as fellow social media addicts , we here at @entity210 understand perfectly .			0

@entity9 is very effective at spreading the news , but not as good at controlling it
