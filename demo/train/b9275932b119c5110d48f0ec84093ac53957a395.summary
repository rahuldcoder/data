@entity0 , @entity1 -- nearly 90 professors at @entity1 's oldest and largest university signed a letter to @entity7 ayatollah @entity6 , criticizing the government 's violent handling of student protesters			1
" the issue that has left a bitter taste in the mouths of the devout muslim and patriots of this land is the violent and above the law [ illegal ] encounters , particularly with @entity24 students and faculty members of this land , " says the letter , which was posted on the reformist web site " @entity19 , " or " @entity20			1
" " in fact , the nightly attacks on the dormitories and living quarters of innocent students and daily assaults on them ... are not testaments to the power of the system , just as the violent beatings and imprisonments are not testament to its faith and piety			1
" the professors ask @entity6 to order revolutionary guards , government - sanctioned militiamen and others who have engaged in campus violence to vacate the university			1
the letter also calls for official apologies for beatings of university members and the unconditional release of detained students and faculty			1
there was no immediate government response to the letter			2
the 88 professors -- all of whom are considered employees of the @entity72 -- who signed the letter are " risking their jobs and @entity66 knows what else , " said @entity57 , a research fellow at the @entity59 - based @entity58 who has researched the relationship between @entity1 civilians and the @entity63			2
" some of them may end up arrested , " he added			0
the letter , posted on a reformist web site monday , is a rare and significant showing of discontent among @entity24 's academics			2
student unrest has only increased since thousands of protesters turned out on the streets of @entity1 to oppose the country 's disputed presidential election , in which hardline incumbent president @entity85 was declared the overwhelming winner			1
" unfortunately and sadly ; all of this takes place under the veil of safeguarding @entity93 and the representation of the supreme leadership and , even more sadly , no institution or organization accepts responsibility for this savagery ! " the anti-government demonstrations began following the disputed june 12 presidential vote , which re-elected hardline president @entity85 over main opposition candidate @entity101			1
last month marked the deadliest clashes since the initial protests broke out this summer			0
at least seven people were killed and hundreds arrested as they took to the streets on @entity107 , a @entity109 holy day			0
one university researcher told @entity2 he was one of many beaten by police , struck with a baton 11 times			0
@entity1 interior minister @entity114 warned saturday that the government will not show leniency to protesters in the future			2
" it does n't surprise me that professors wrote this letter , because universities have been one of the first victims of increased government pressure , " @entity57 said			1
in the aftermath of the election , @entity24 and other institutions quickly became hotbeds of violence , with members of the government 's @entity133 militia attacking young protesters on campus , including dormitories			1
in august , @entity6 addressed a group of university professors from all over , noting that academics would be held to a higher standard of accountability -- especially after the elections			1
" naturally , the expectations that we have of the professors and faculty is much greater than what we expect from the students , " @entity6 was quoted by @entity1 media as saying on august 30			1
" the students are the young officers on the front lines of this war and the professors are the commanders [ against ] this ' soft war ' -- the professors who can fulfill this role will be worthy of the @entity63 republic			0
" the @entity1 government has denied that its security forces killed anyone and has blamed reformists for the violence			0
at times , video has shown protesters apparently turning on security forces			0
still , the letter serves as another blow to @entity1 's @entity63 leadership , which reformists say has lost credibility in its handling of the post-election unrest			2
several critics , including cleric and former presidential candidate @entity178 have compared the tactics of the current government to those of the @entity182 , who was overthrown by the same fervent followers of @entity93 more than 30 years ago			0
@entity57 noted that numerous petitions were drafted and published in the days leading up to the overthrow of the @entity187 , who was also slammed with allegations of injustice and human rights violations under his watch			0
he said it 's no surprise that academics today are taking a similar approach as it becomes increasingly harder to teach amid the violence			0
" the opposition and even ordinary citizen are trying to duplicate the events of 30 years ago -- they 're trying to play to the memory of the public , " @entity57 said			0
@entity2 's @entity200 contributed to this report .			0
