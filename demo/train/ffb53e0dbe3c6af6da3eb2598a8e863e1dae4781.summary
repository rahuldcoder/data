how close was @entity3 to building a nuclear weapon ? the deal does not stop the @entity3 nuclear program			1
it merely slows certain elements of that program for six months while others continue			0
after six months , @entity3 can resume where it left off			1
@entity3 made no concessions that can not be reversed			2
more telling , @entity3 has protected its top nuclear priority			2
the deal allows it to continue enriching uranium , a stark departure from previous @entity19 policy and a clutch of @entity21 that declare enrichment by @entity3 illegal and unacceptable , period			1
if @entity3 was on the verge of a nuclear breakout , it might make sense to pay a high price to slow the @entity3 nuclear program			2
if nuclear breakout was less imminent , the trade - off looks reckless			2
20 questions about the @entity3 nuclear deal 2 ) how close was @entity3 to economic collapse ? the @entity3 economy is staggering			1
its currency has lost three - quarters of its value over the past two years			0
goods have vanished from shops			0
unemployment is high , and inflation roars			0
this year -- and over the objections of the @entity43 administration -- @entity44 imposed the most effective round of sanctions yet : the @entity48 sanctions that barred @entity3 from the international payments system			1
sanctions have squeezed one of the world 's major oil producers to the point where it has access to perhaps only $ 20 billion in usable hard currency , barely more than @entity58			0
this deal unfreezes $ 7 billion in cash , a big infusion			0
potentially even more important , the deal relaxes sanctions on gold , opening the way to the resumption of an old sanctions - busting trick : selling oil abroad in exchange for gold trucked in from neighboring @entity72			1
@entity3 will also be allowed to buy spare parts for its aging civilian aircraft			2
3 ) how much do we care about making @entity3 's new president look good ? @entity3 is no democracy , but it has a political process			1
elections are manipulated , and candidates unacceptable to the religious establishment are barred from the ballot , but there is some space for some limited discussion of issues			0
in the presidential elections this summer , the winning candidate , @entity87 , pledged to obtain relief from sanctions			1
some in the @entity43 administration seem to have decided that @entity87 is an @entity3 @entity92 , a leader with whom the @entity93 can do business			1
in this view , a " win " for @entity87 is important to the @entity93 , strengthening moderates against hardliners and opening the way to a broader detente			1
the trouble with this view , however , is that the evidence is strong that @entity87 is really the @entity3 @entity104 , the former @entity105 secret police chief who preceded @entity92			1
less doctrinaire and stupid than other communist leaders , @entity104 was no less hostile to the @entity93			0
@entity87 led the long effort to dupe @entity109 governments about @entity3 's nuclear program in the earlier 2000s			1
there 's every reason to fear that the " detente " he wants is one that allows @entity3 to obtain a respite from sanctions while continuing its development of weapons of mass destruction			1
4 ) how little do we care about the anxieties of regional allies ? @entity125 and @entity126 have vociferously voiced their dismay at this agreement			0
smaller allies such as the @entity131 have been less vociferous but no less dismayed			0
the @entity43 administration answers , " we know better			0
we have larger interests and therefore larger perspective			0
we put our interests ahead of yours			0
" that 's what great powers do			0
but is this particular great power correct at this particular time ? being big is not the same thing as being smart			0
5 ) how much do we care about other forms of @entity3 misconduct ? even if @entity3 had never started its nuclear program , it would qualify as a major bad actor			1
without @entity3 support for @entity151 's @entity150 , that country 's civil war would have ended long ago			1
@entity3 makes mischief in @entity153 and @entity154 , bankrolls terror attacks on @entity125 and @entity126 , and trains and supports anti- @entity19 movements and regimes in places as far away as @entity160			2
none of that behavior was on the table on @entity164 , and therefore that behavior will continue after @entity164			0
does that behavior not matter ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			2

@entity169 : was deal smart ? if @entity3 was **n't** close to building a nuke , deal looks reckless
he says deal relaxes sanctions just when they *'d* left @entity3 close to economic collapse
he says some view president @entity87 as a @entity92 - type figure
@entity182 : deal does **n't** address @entity3 as bad actor in @entity151 and beyond ; does that not matter ?
