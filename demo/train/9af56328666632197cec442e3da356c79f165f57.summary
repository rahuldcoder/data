-- now that it 's almost over , let 's remember how the whole thing started			2
" @entity7 " is the story of a high school chemistry teacher who found out he had lung cancer			1
not that there 's ever a good time for this news , but for this guy , the timing could n't have been worse : a pregnant wife , a handicapped son and financial circumstances so dire ( did i mention he was a public high school teacher ? ) that his wife and children will be impoverished when he dies			2
so he did exactly what you or i would do under the circumstances : get into the burgeoning market for crystal methamphetamine			0
among the many things you wonder : what kind of country , especially one as supposedly civilized and technologically advanced as this , would put any of its citizens in such a predicament ? and there are duly elected representatives still willing to put this country 's government into a coma until they force repeal of the relatively meager measures enacted into law to widen its citizens ' access to health care			2
granted this teacher 's situation is that of an imaginary character , a sad little man who becomes enlarged by the kind of situational barbarism that can rationalize anything			1
but long before @entity49 became a buzzword , every @entity48 could recognize this fellow 's desperate cornering as something that could happen to her or him			2
ah , but imagine a more libertarian sensibility making this case			2
while dealing crystal meth is a very bad thing , the fact that this poor sap could use his resources as a chemist to secure enough money for treatment only proves that you do n't need any government - subsidized medical care			0
and if the casualties of this shake - and - bake encompass dead law enforcement officers , garroted convicts , innocent passengers and crews on two commercial jets along with thousands of hapless addicts on two continents , well , these are what we call the breaks			0
and anyway , there are many ways for an @entity48 to exert initiative , to figure his own way out of such dilemmas that do n't involve violent death and self - destruction			0
at least , not necessarily			0
which , as everyone who 's paid close attention of " @entity7 " will tell you , sounds exactly like something @entity94 would say			1
no matter where you stand on health care -- or on anything else -- " @entity7 " has been able to make the ground beneath your feet softer and shakier than you think			1
not since " @entity100 " ( to my mind , its one true peer in this golden age for cable television series ) has there been a tv drama that watches us as intensely -- and almost as balefully -- as we watch it			0
remember how we were pulled every which way on how to feel about the psychologically wounded @entity110 's struggle to reconcile being both a dedicated family man and ruthless criminal entrepreneur in the thick of the turn - of - the - century economic boom ? so are we now torn between pity and scorn for the morally crippled @entity94 's fumbling and now crumbling attempts to keep everybody close to him alive , well and happy in the midst of his sordid machinations ? is his dismal negotiation of narrowing options a hint of what the " @entity127 " has in store for us ? maybe , maybe not			1
such a question would never occur to us if we were watching a television crime show 50 , 40 , even 30 years ago when " @entity134 " assumed credit for introducing black comedy and moral ambiguity to police melodrama			0
" @entity7 " has never overtly claimed to explain the way we live now			1
the finest works of art and literature never have to			0
when we watch @entity140 ( whom i 've been proclaiming our greatest living actor since roughly the second of this show 's five seasons ) inhabit the rotting soul of @entity94 as he keeps trying to explain away everything , we are both riveted and appalled by his cluelessness , his monstrousness and his plausibility			1
whether it 's passively watching a junkie choking to death on her own vomit , engineering a nursing home 's explosion to eliminate a threat to his survival or manipulating his partner @entity160 ( @entity161 , who will someday revive the heroic private detective genre by himself ) away from suspecting him of attempted child murder , @entity151 is able to explain away all of it , to convince himself , if no one else ( the viewers least of all ) , that he 's doing it all to make the best out of a bad situation			1
call this impulse what you want , making excuses or , better still , total denial			0
denial is @entity151 's true addiction			0
more than the " crystal blue persuasion " @entity151 's been cooking or the ricin he threatens to use , denial is the toxic , satanic brew permeating " @entity7 's " narrative			1
deniers are worse than explainers when they facilitate or validate gruesome activities			0
and yet , there have been times in the five - season run of @entity7 when a small part of us rooted for @entity151 to make the best of things somehow , even in his own twisted fashion , as though we could n't quite believe or accept that anyone in his situation would submit to an alter ego as forbidding and deadly as @entity195 the @entity196			1
from a safe distance , we judge him as we would any sociopath			0
but that 's too easy given what a complicated mess he is			0
and it 's the seeming normality of @entity94 that makes us interrogate ourselves more than he interrogates himself			1
the honest , overpowering question : how much of this jerk 's disease is carried in us ? how much are we willing to pass by or let go just to make the best of our generally imperfect lives ? i like to think i would n't go anywhere near @entity151 's dark side -- and i 'm sure most of " @entity7 's " audience feels the same way			1
but just as @entity110 became our perverse surrogate in lunging for the goodies of the boom years , @entity94 is the dreaded specter of the bust era , making one terrible choice after another as the legacy of dead bodies and dread excuses slowly close in on him for what promises to be a shattering revelation			1
no wonder we ca n't wait to see how it all comes out			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 .			2

@entity229 : " @entity7 's " focus on an *anti-hero* *challenges* viewers ' normal stances
he says we are torn between pity and scorn for the main character , played by @entity140
@entity242 : @entity94 is the dreaded specter of our era , making one bad choice after another
