-- the stock market crashed			1
people stashed silver and gold under mattresses while businesses shut doors across @entity9			1
people in @entity11 , @entity12 , line up for food at the @entity14			1
we 're talking , of course , about the @entity17 ... of 1873			1
that 's the event that @entity19 cites when asked to give an historical perspective on today 's sputtering economy			2
the historian says the economic panic of 1873 started with the same toxic mix as today 's crisis : risky mortgages , a stock market dive and the use of complex financial instruments that few understood			2
" until 1929 , when people used the word [ s ] @entity17 they referred to 1873 , " says @entity19 , a professor of history at the @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34			1
" that was a worldwide international depression that started with the banks			1
that 's what we 're seeing now			2
" the nation 's economic crisis is not only causing people to look more closely at their 401 ( k ) account statements			1
they 're also turning to their history books			2
politicians and commentators routinely invoke the @entity17 and other historical events to describe today 's economic crisis			1
but how fair is that historical analogy ? why @entity17 comparisons may be unfair @entity55 , an economist at @entity56 , says the nation experienced two " rough " recessions in the mid- 1970s and the early 1980s			1
a recession is generally defined as a decline in the @entity61 for two or more consecutive quarters			2
he says it 's not fair to compare the current economic crisis to the @entity17 because the federal government was far more passive in the 1920s			1
" we let 15,000 out of 30,000 banks fail , " he says			2
" government efforts to jump - start the economy were slow and relatively weak until president [ @entity73 ] @entity72 came along with the @entity74			2
" @entity55 says people can learn more by looking at @entity76			1
he says the @entity9 economy is facing the same crisis as @entity76 in the 1990s when the @entity76 economy collapsed from a real estate bubble , and never fully recovered			2
" the @entity76 government moved too slowly and not aggressively enough , " he says			2
" @entity83 , a professor of economics at @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity87 , says the federal government better protects ordinary people from financial ruin today than during the first stages of the @entity17			1
today we reap the benefits of policies created during that era , @entity83 says			2
@entity72 helped create @entity74 legislation to insure bank deposits and enacted other modern relief efforts like unemployment compensation to help those in distress			2
" by any measure , incomes were lower then than now , and the worst imaginable loss of output today would still keep the nation well above where we were back then , " @entity83 says			1
@entity107 is not an economist , but she definitely knows something about the @entity17			1
@entity107 , 83 , grew up on an @entity111 farm during the @entity17 and lived through the @entity113 storms			1
for much of that decade , " black blizzards " -- formed by a prolonged drought and poor farming techniques -- ravaged the @entity114			0
@entity107 , who now lives in @entity118 , @entity119 , snorted when told that today 's conditions remind some of the @entity17			1
during the depression , crops failed , and few had a job , car or clothes , she says			1
" everyone had one nail for themselves in the clothes closet , " @entity127 says			0
@entity127 says the @entity17 toughened people up			1
people grew and canned their own food , sewed their own clothes and learned how to make possessions last			1
" no one really came from wealth , and nothing was easy , " she says			0
" but people got by because they had a wonderful spirit of survival			1
we 're not as gutsy			0
i do n't know if we have that today			0
" why this economic period is still frightening @entity145 , an economist at the @entity146 in @entity147 , @entity148 , says the nation 's most recent recession was the dot - com bust , which hit around march 2001			1
" this recession has already eclipsed the dot - com bust in every fashion , " he says			0
" during that time , the gdp did not fall much , and unemployment did not rise much			0
" @entity145 offers one bit of good news , though			0
he says today 's unemployment rate is not as bad as in previous eras			0
the unemployment rate reached 10.8 percent during the early 1980s and 25 percent during the @entity17 , he says			1
yet @entity145 says there is an ominous feature to the current situation : the @entity164 has lowered interest rates as far as they can go , to around zero percent , but the recession marches on			0
the current recession is so " scary " that @entity145 says he has reversed his attitude on @entity170 's $ 787 billion stimulus plan			0
he once opposed it but now supports it because he ca n't think of anything that might work better			0
he says the economy will not bounce back on its own anytime soon			0
" you got ta go with what you got , " he says			0
" the @entity164 has loosed all of its cannons , and it has nothing left			0
now we 're down to fiscal policy			0
" @entity19 , the historian who has studied the panic of 1873 , says today 's economy might even be worse than the @entity9 economy in 1873			0
" this is a perfect storm : banks failing , stock markets declining and commodity prices dropping , " @entity19 says			0
@entity19 says it took @entity9 four years to recover from the 1873 panic			0
tens of thousands of workers -- many @entity195 veterans -- became homeless			0
thousands lined up for food and shelter in major cities			0
the @entity200 , where wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few " robber barons like @entity204 , " followed the panic			0
@entity9 , of course , pulled out of the panic			0
@entity19 is just not quite sure how the nation is going to do it now			1
his ultimate assessment of today 's economy is blunt : " it looks grim			0

is it fair to invoke @entity17 ?
some economists say comparison *overblown*
nation had another @entity17 few remember , *scholar* says
depression survivor : " people had a wonderful spirit of survival "
