-- " @entity10 " beat out films from the likes of @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 to top honors at the @entity6 on sunday -- not bad for a silent , black - and - white @entity8 film with no big - name stars			1
director @entity13 's love letter to old @entity15 cinema was the undisputed king of the industry 's biggest night , garnering five @entity6 for best picture , best directing , best costume design , best original music score and best actor			1
but was the rise of " @entity10 " from contender to best picture winner -- the first silent film to win the award since " wings " at the first @entity6 in 1929 -- a triumph of marketing over art ? for many , the film 's triumph at the @entity6 was a foregone conclusion , the result of a marketing process set in motion months ago by movie mogul @entity39 , who snapped up the @entity41 distribution rights before anyone at the @entity43 had a chance to swoon over the @entity8 film last year			1
" there was n't any doubt when it came to the top awards who the winners were going to be , " @entity47 deputy editor @entity46 told @entity11			0
" @entity39 is the best in the business at getting that awards attention , and it became clear with ' @entity10 ' two months ago that this was the film that had caught the tailwind			2
" the mercurial movie promoter and co-founder of @entity61 , credited for discovering " @entity63 " director @entity62 and a string of commercial and critical successes including " @entity66 , " " @entity67 " and last year 's " @entity68 , " is famous for harnessing the momentum of his films at the right time and riding waves of publicity to wins at the podium and at the box office			1
no sooner had @entity77 taken the top actor award for his portrayal of silent film star @entity10 at @entity43 than @entity39 had the film 's stars and directors hitting the award campaign circuit to capitalize on its surprise success			1
best actor winner @entity77 walked red carpets around the world as other awards began to flood in			0
co-stars @entity88 and @entity90 plugged the film on @entity11 , and @entity92 , the film 's canine star , played dead and performed tricks from the film on major news channels on both sides of the @entity98			0
" people who do n't play the game tend not to win at the @entity6 , " said @entity46			0
" you really have to press the flesh and hit the road , and for the last three months their lives would 've been dedicated to that			0
" @entity107 's @entity106 says that by the time the @entity111 nominations came around , the race for @entity6 glory had narrowed to a two - horse race between @entity4 's " @entity113 " and " @entity10 " -- a race @entity116 's relentless campaign strategy began to win by the end of last year			1
" something about what @entity39 managed to do -- getting these three very charming leads and the director out there , getting the dog out there , screening it to everyone who mattered , milking the nostalgia and old @entity127 of it -- lifted it from the competitor to the favorite long before the show came around , " he told @entity11			0
" once one film has a foothold -- once it 's become the thing like ' @entity68 ' did last year -- then even @entity4 ca n't compete , " he said			0
@entity39 's strength , says @entity106 , lies in his ability to catch a " middle - brow " film right before it becomes popular and turn it into the frontrunner			2
@entity106 told @entity11 : " he 's very good at picking the middle - brow films ... and the @entity6 are a mainstream event which celebrates the best of the middle			0
@entity39 's been a very wily player in that , and you have to give him that credit , he knows how to map that out over a year			2
" while " @entity10 " has punched above its weight at the box office , tallying roughly $ 76 million in worldwide receipts so far ( 58 % from outside the @entity41 ) , the film did n't receive much of a box office bump following the announcement of @entity6 nominations in january , according to @entity106 -- especially compared with " @entity68 , " which raked in an estimated $ 415 million worldwide ( 66 % from international ) on its way to winning best picture , actor and director at the @entity159			1
" it has n't made the usual @entity6 success money that the ' @entity68 ' did last year , " said @entity106			2
" it 's a silent film with a @entity8 sensibility , and it 's a tougher sell for audiences			0
but now that it 's got all the attention in the world , can that translate to more money ? " while the money may not follow , @entity106 says one thing seems certain -- after a relatively dry decade , the back - to - back successes of " @entity68 " and " @entity10 " means @entity39 is back in business			1
" @entity39 's come out of his fallow years as the guy to beat at the @entity6 , " he said			1
" it 's a bit of a second coming -- clearly he 's still got a little bit of that magic			0

" @entity10 " won @entity6 for best picture , best director , best actor
@entity39 's company also distributed " @entity182 , " " @entity183 " and " *undefeated* "
movie mogul @entity39 also a big winner last year with " @entity68 "
