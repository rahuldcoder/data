-- scaffolding that collapsed during a storm and killed seven people during the @entity4 last year was not up to standard , and the fair 's commission did not have adequate emergency planning in place , according to two investigative reports presented thursday			1
" calculations and in - situ physical testing determined the @entity12 ( support ) system had grossly inadequate capacity to resist both the minimum code - specified wind speed ( 68 miles per hour ) and the actual wind speed that was present at the time of the failure ( approximately 59 miles per hour ) , " according to a report by @entity22 , an engineering firm			1
the findings were presented by representatives from the firm and officials from @entity27 , a public safety and crisis management consulting group			0
the @entity29 had estimated winds of 60 to 70 mph were raking the area when the incident occurred in august			1
a massive gust of wind brought down the stage , killing five people and injuring dozens			1
two others later died as a result of the collapse			0
" a big gust of wind came through			0
you could see a lot of people panicking			1
all the scaffolding and speakers -- all that came crashing down -- and the whole stand just collapsed , " said @entity46 at the time , who witnessed the collapse			1
@entity53 , the country music duo of @entity55 and @entity56 who were scheduled to perform during the fair , issued a statement thursday saying that , " in all the back - and - forth between the lawyers , the suggestion 's been made that we 've somehow been trying to avoid having to answer questions about last summer 's terrible tragedy			1
" " this is simply not true , " they said			0
" there is no one who wants to get to the bottom of what happened more than we do , which is why we 're ready , willing , and able to give these depositions today and tomorrow			0
" they added that they " want all the facts to come out , not only for the sake of all the victims and their loved ones , but also so we can make sure that nothing like this ever happens again			0
" @entity80 , the group 's spokesman added : " the fact is that @entity55 and @entity56 never told anyone not to delay the concert because of the weather			1
they care deeply about their fans and , as they 've said , nobody wants to get to the bottom of what happened more than they do			0
" @entity92 gov. @entity91 said his administration " will insist on immediate and complete implementation of the recommendations in this report			2
" " but it 's also now clear that most , if not all states , have been deficient in this area and have much to learn from this tragedy , " he said in a statement			2
" we will share freely all these findings and suggestions with any state who will listen , starting later this month at a national meeting in @entity108 about national safety standards for outdoor temporary stages and structures			0
" in february , the @entity92 @entity112 announced penalties totaling $ 80,800 following a worker safety investigation into the collapse			0
the largest fines -- totaling $ 63,000 for what the agency said were three " knowing violations " -- were levied on @entity120 , which built the stage structure and leased it to the fair			2
metal scaffolding supporting the stage lights fell onto a crowd of fans and workers as a storm swept through the @entity108 fairgrounds on august 13 , 2011 , right before @entity53 was to perform .			2
