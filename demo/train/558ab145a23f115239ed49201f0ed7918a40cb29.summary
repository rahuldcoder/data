@entity1 , @entity0 -- the day after @entity3 was a tough one for @entity4 in his ancestral homeland of @entity0			2
a @entity7 youth group held a demonstration thursday in @entity1 , blasting the " jolly old elf " of legend and lore for contributing to moral decay and urging residents to turn against him			1
" traditions such as new year celebrations , christmas tree decorations , and @entity4 leaving presents are leading to degeneration of our culture and leading to identity crises in our society			0
it tears our youth from their own culture and familiarizes them with the culture of the @entity31 leading them to embrace those values , " the @entity24 said in a statement			0
the group used an inflatable plastic @entity4 as a prop -- littering the ground below it with beer cans , a syringe and a cross to illustrate the dangers of inviting @entity4 into @entity0 homes			2
they also distributed an image of a man delivering a brutal left hook to @entity4 's bearded cheek			0
three years ago , the same group stabbed a blow - up @entity4			1
such sentiments are not widespread in @entity0			0
many secular @entity7 in @entity0 decorate their homes with @entity3 trees and @entity53 -- known in @entity0 as " @entity54 , " or @entity3			1
they exchange gifts not on @entity3 , but rather @entity56			0
despite thursday 's unpleasantness , @entity0 and ol ' @entity4 go way back -- all the way to 4th century			1
that 's when , as religious tradition has it , the @entity61 secretly gifted money and other items to residents around his home in what is now the southern @entity0 city of @entity70 , becoming the model for the modern @entity4			1
