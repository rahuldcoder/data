-- over the course of his 50 - plus years in @entity3 , @entity1 has become the archetype of the star who lives by his own rules			1
along the way , the actor known for thwarting convention has revamped the very idea of what it means to be a leading man			0
now , that life is on full display as the subject of a new ( unauthorized ) biography by @entity18 , whose ample resume includes works on @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
all the @entity1 stories are there : his " overnight " success in " @entity29 " that was preceded by 19 movies ; his unorthodox lifestyle ; and his grand appetite -- particularly for food and sex			1
here are 10 things you may not know about @entity1 , as gleaned from @entity18 's book and @entity0 's interview with the author			1
at age 76 , the actor allegedly still does n't know the identity of his real father			0
according to @entity18 , @entity44 is listed on @entity1 's birth certificate , but the author writes that the star 's actual father was a man named @entity49 , " a sometime musician who played with various pickup bands along the @entity52			1
" to make family matters even more complicated , @entity1 apparently did n't discover until he was an adult that the woman he thought was his older sister was actually his mother , and the woman he thought was his mother was really his grandmother			1
all this bears an ironic resemblance to the storyline in " @entity62 , " where @entity64 's character belatedly confesses about a mystery girl , " she 's my sister ... my daughter			0
she 's my sister and my daughter ! " 2			0
@entity1 improvised the famous dentist 's chair scene in @entity71 's " the @entity70 " ( 1960 ) , a performance so memorable it would earn him his first role in a studio film ( 1960 's " @entity75 " )			1
the entire film was shot in two days on a micro-budget			0
to save money , @entity1 , @entity71 and the rest of the filmmaking team vaulted the fences at @entity83 's old studio in @entity3 , where they filmed without permission , @entity18 recounts			1
@entity1 made over a dozen movies with @entity71 in the early part of his career			1
" @entity71 is the person most responsible for @entity1 becoming an actor and then a star , " @entity18 told @entity0			1
@entity1 's big break of course came in the role of @entity94 in 1969 's " @entity29			1
" the part was initially to be filled by @entity96 , until that actor quit after feuding with director and co-star @entity99			0
@entity1 's salary : $ 392 a week			1
to adopt a @entity102 twang for the part ( and drop his native @entity104 accent ) , @entity1 listened to tapes of a former president			1
" they made him listen to speeches of @entity109 over and over again until @entity1 was able to pick up a few nuances of the accent , " @entity18 said			1
the film premiered at the @entity113 in may 1969 , and " @entity1 was really a complete unknown " at that point , @entity18 said			1
" as he walked out of the theater ( after the premiere ) , he knew and everybody in that audience knew that he was going to be a star			0
among @entity1 's most famous roles is the rebellious @entity122 in " @entity123 " ( which won him his first @entity125 in 1976 )			2
but @entity18 writes @entity1 almost lost out on the part to a slew of other stars			1
producers @entity23 and @entity134 's first choice to play @entity122 " was @entity129 , who immediately said no , then @entity130 , who also turned them down , " @entity18 writes			2
" so did @entity135 and @entity136			0
" but @entity1 has turned down his share of roles too , including some that made cinema history -- with other actors portraying them			2
according to @entity18 , these are among the roles @entity1 spurned : @entity144 in " @entity145 " the young priest in " @entity147 " the lead in " @entity149 " the @entity151 role in " @entity152 " the @entity154 role in " the @entity155 " the @entity157 role in " @entity158 " the @entity160 role in " @entity161 " @entity162 in " @entity163 " @entity164 in 1974 's " @entity165 " the @entity167 connection 5			1
@entity18 writes that @entity1 was friends with @entity169 , who was among the multiple victims of the @entity167			1
and when @entity167 went on trial for the murders in 1970 , @entity1 attended the proceedings virtually every day			2
" he was fascinated by @entity167 's persona and the crazy way he looked " during the trial , @entity18 writes			2
" @entity1 ... could n't get enough of it			2
" his fascination with prominent trials was not limited to the @entity167 case , according to @entity18			2
the author writes that @entity1 also attended the 1977 trial of actress @entity183 ( @entity185 ' ex-wife ) , who was accused of killing her lover , " @entity187			2
" he always sat in the first row of spectators , usually next to ( @entity185 ) @entity185 , mystified by the lovely face of a woman driven to kill , " @entity18 writes			2
to judge from @entity18 's biography , @entity1 may have bedded more women than any other star ( with the possible exception of @entity196 )			1
space does not permit a full listing of his conquests , but @entity18 reports they include : @entity200 ( his co-star in " @entity201 " ) @entity202 @entity203 @entity204 ( of the @entity205 ) @entity206 @entity207 @entity208 @entity209 @entity210 @entity211 ( then the estranged wife of the @entity214 prime minister ) @entity215 ( daughter of @entity217 ) @entity18 describes a particularly voracious period of carousing for @entity1 , when he and friend @entity23 were traveling the world to promote " @entity123			1
" " they stripped and devoured ( young women ) like peeling shrimp , " @entity18 writes , " as they romped through @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232			2
@entity1 's other love , apart from women , is collecting art. according to @entity18 , the actor 's collection is worth $ 100 million , comprised of works by @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245			1
how did @entity1 afford all that expensive art ? by becoming one of the wealthiest actors in @entity3			2
as one of the industry 's most sought - after talents , he was able to strike a hard bargain for his services -- demanding and receiving profit participation in the great majority of his films			0
the most lucrative role of @entity1 's career came as the @entity257 in @entity261 's " @entity260 " ( 1989 )			1
the actor 's take : somewhere between $ 60 million and $ 90 million , according to @entity18			2
@entity1 might have done the role for nothing , given how much he loved @entity260 lore			0
@entity18 writes the actor grew up reading @entity260 comic books and was especially fond of that grinning villain			0
" playing the @entity257 was not a gag for him , " @entity18 told @entity0			0
" for @entity1 , ( appearing in ' @entity260 ' ) was a chance to connect to childhood			0
" according to @entity18 , @entity1 was so taken with the role he shelled out $ 70,000 to buy his character 's " electrified purple clown outfit			1
" the famous golf club incident 9			0
many instances of @entity1 's generosity are detailed in the book , but so are his occasional outbursts			0
none is more famous than the day in february 1994 when he demonstrated his golf swing for the driver of a @entity283			0
the mallet in question ? a two - iron ( graphite shaft )			0
@entity1 pulled it from its bag and smashed the windshield and roof of the @entity283 after the driver allegedly cut him off in traffic			0
it was a costly encounter			0
@entity1 settled a civil suit filed by the driver ; @entity18 cites unnamed sources who peg the payout at $ 500,000			1
has @entity1 retired ? 10			0
the one question the book does n't answer is whether @entity1 will make another film			0
he has n't starred in anything since 2010 's " @entity306 , " and a recent unsubstantiated report claimed the actor had retired ( @entity0 previously reached out to @entity1 's agent , @entity302 , for comment on that but did not receive a reply )			0
@entity18 told @entity0 " retirement " is a dirty word in @entity3 , because actors , no matter what their age , are always hoping one more great role will come their way			0
the author told @entity0 he hopes we have n't seen the last @entity1 performance			0
" hopefully we 'll have more of @entity1 , because you can never have enough			0

@entity18 has written an unauthorized biography of @entity1
the writer covers his career and unorthodox lifestyle
the tome is filled with *tidbits* that fans may not know about
