-- the death of @entity2 is not the game - changer many would like it to be			1
his regime was already a thing of the past			0
for @entity11 's transitional government , the challenges today are just as daunting as they were last week			1
to be sure , @entity2 's death provides them a moment of respite and an important propaganda boost as they try to cobble together a credible coalition that can govern			1
it further breaks down the psychological barrier of fear so many @entity11 have continued to feel , left over from decades of dictatorial rule			1
however , the gains , while important , are more symbolic than practical			0
@entity2 was the greatest unifier @entity11 could have asked for			1
he was erratic , brutal and a mismanager par excellence and , as such , managed to mobilize a broad swath of @entity11 around a shared goal : the downfall of his hated regime			1
now that @entity2 has left the scene , the rebels and their fledgling government have lost their original raison d'etre			1
@entity11 was the @entity36 's first true revolution , the only one in which the revolutionaries now hold the levers of power			1
and , unlike @entity42 and @entity43 , @entity11 does not have to contend with old , decaying institutions			2
the old regime does not need to be adapted to the new			0
but as promising as blank slates are , they are also dangerous			0
the @entity49 has been plagued by infighting and the emergence of factions			0
the divisions have taken on an increasingly ideological tone			0
it is the same old story : liberals and islamists come together during the revolution , only to split afterward , often in acrimony			0
above all else , a government needs to govern			2
it has to have a monopoly on the use of force , and this is a challenge in one the world 's most heavily armed countries			2
the various militias that helped bring down @entity2 now represent competing centers of power and influence			1
disarming them , or integrating them into the national army , is a key task ahead for @entity11 's new leaders			1
the euphoria we are witnessing today in the streets of @entity80 and @entity81 is encouraging			0
but it is also premature and misleading			0
it is likely to be remembered as a brief but welcome aberration in a slow slog toward something resembling democracy			2
all the actors with a stake in @entity11 should quickly adjust their expectations accordingly			2
i , and many others , are optimistic about @entity11 prospects , but only if @entity11 -- and international supporters and donors -- get the key components of the transitions right and do it right away			1
revolutions are much more glamorous when they are being fought , less so when they 're being built through the sometimes unsavory give - and - take of consensus building			0
with @entity104 disintegrating , @entity43 holding landmark elections and @entity42 sputtering along unconvincingly , the attentions of the international community are understandably divided			1
but it can not afford to forget @entity11			2
fortunately , @entity11 is perhaps the only @entity106 country where people seem to genuinely like @entity108 and the @entity109 for the decisive support they offered to the revolution			2
that sort of good will does n't come every day			0
here 's hoping that we use it and that we use it for good			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity119 .			0

@entity119 : @entity11 's new government 's task is challenge even before @entity2 's death
*loathing* for regime unified @entity11 , he says ; now new government must unify , govern
disarming militias , integrating them into army next task ; slog toward democracy begins
@entity119 : international community must use its unique chance to help @entity11 in its transition
