it did n't take long monday for speculation to ramp up online over the timing of the @entity4 bombings , which came on @entity5 , a @entity6 state holiday commemorating the opening battles of the @entity8			1
the @entity10 uprising against the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity6 , was on april 19 , 1775 , but @entity5 is celebrated in @entity6 and @entity13 on the third monday in april , falling this year on april 15			1
" it 's a day that celebrates the free and fiercely independent spirit that this great @entity10 city of @entity21 has reflected from the earliest days of our nation , " president @entity14 said monday , a few hours after a pair of bombs rocked the finish line of the @entity4 , killing at least three and injuring dozens more			2
for many @entity25 , it is a day of pride that comes with historical re-enactments , the @entity4 , baseball and a day off for schools and government employees			2
it 's now a day that will go down in history along with other violent @entity10 incidents in april , including the 1993 @entity37 siege of @entity39 's compound in @entity40 , @entity41 , the 1995 @entity43 bombing , a mass shooting at @entity45 in 1999 and the @entity46 in 2007			1
only the @entity40 siege and the @entity43 bombing actually occurred on april 19 , the anniversary of the @entity50			1
still , to many following developments in @entity21 online , the proximity of monday 's attack to the april 19 anniversaries was enough to suggest an act of domestic terrorism			1
" obviously , nobody knows anything yet , " @entity60 's @entity59 said , " but i would caution folks jumping to conclusions about foreign terrorism to remember that this is the official @entity5 holiday in @entity6 ... and that the actual date ( april 19 ) was of some significance to , among other people , @entity68 , because he fancied himself a waterer of the tree of liberty and the like			1
" @entity68 and @entity43 bombing co-conspirator @entity72 were associated with the extreme right - wing and militant @entity73 , which rejects the legitimacy of the federal government and law enforcement			2
adherents sometimes form armed militia groups and claim the right to armed self - defense against what they believe to be an oppressive government			0
@entity68 said he targeted the @entity85 in @entity43 to avenge the raid on @entity40			2
despite commonly held beliefs , it 's unclear whether the @entity45 shooters timed that attack to mark either @entity92 's birthday or the @entity40 incident			2
time @entity95 correspondent @entity94 also noted @entity5 's " significance " to the " militia movement " in a tweet that was shared 507 times			0
he also mentioned the @entity43 bombing anniversary			1
in a subsequent tweet , he clarified that " @entity101 was on apr. 19 , anniversary of the @entity103 , which are celebrated in @entity6 as @entity5			1
" but is there really something about this time of the year that makes domestic terrorism more prevalent ? " i have seen nothing to suggest that anything about april itself makes people violent , " @entity108 , who runs the blog @entity110 , said in a 2011 interview with @entity112 about the 20 - year anniversary of the siege of the @entity40 compound			1
" that said , the reason why we see certain types of political violence in mid- to late april is because of a few unhappy coincidences : that @entity40 happened to fall on the anniversary of the @entity50 , the first battles in a war against a tyrannical oppressor			2
" for many people who labor under the idea that the federal government is a tyrannical foreign oppressor like the @entity11 monarchy , @entity40 symbolizes a war of a government against its people			0
" in the mythology that has grown up around @entity40 and @entity43 among self - identified patriots , he said " the 19th has become a sort of high holiday for those who think that they live under the thumb of a tyranny			1
" but , as the injury count continues to rise in @entity21 , the prevailing sentiment is sorrow and solidarity			0
" do n't know what to say			0
everyone who grew up in and around @entity21 has been at the finish line on @entity5			0
could have been any of us , " tweeted @entity155 , digital editor for @entity157 's " @entity158 " show			0
president @entity14 offered a nod to the city 's strength			0
" @entity21 is a tough and resilient town , so are its people , " he said			0
" i 'm supremely confident that @entity163 will pull together , take care of each other , and move forward as one proud city			0
" and , as they do , the @entity10 people will be with them every single step of the way			0
