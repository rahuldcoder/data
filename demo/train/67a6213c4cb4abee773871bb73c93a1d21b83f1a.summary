-- as speculation grows over @entity4 's path to freedom , @entity1 teased that his " flight of liberty " campaign starts wednesday , promising further details			1
but so far , @entity1 has not lived up to the @entity11 promise to provide more details			2
and the questions are piling up			0
is the future of the @entity16 intelligence leaker , grounded at @entity18 's airport for more than two weeks , no longer up in the air ? not so fast			1
it 's unclear whether @entity4 has accepted anyone 's offer of asylum			1
and if he has , how does he intend to get there ? speculation centers on @entity26 , which was the first to offer asylum			1
with both sides expressing interest , it only appeared to be a matter of time before it is confirmed			0
@entity26 extended the asylum offer to @entity4 last week , and on monday president @entity33 received a formal asylum request from @entity4			1
just who is @entity4 ? there were flurries of information tuesday after a tweet by a @entity41 lawmaker announced that @entity4 had accepted @entity26 's offer of asylum			1
but the lawmaker who sent the tweet , @entity41 parliamentary spokesman @entity45 , deleted the message			0
@entity1 , which has been assisting @entity4 in his asylum bid , denied the report in a @entity11 post			1
" the states concerned will make the announcement if and when the appropriate time comes , " @entity1 said			2
" the announcement will then be confirmed by us			0
" if @entity4 does accept , it resolves one issue in the saga , but sets the stage for the next chapter : how will he get from @entity18 to @entity60 ? creative maneuvering the trick would seem to be avoiding @entity16 airspace or the airspace of nations friendly to the @entity16			1
@entity4 , a former @entity69 contractor who faces espionage charges , would be wise to take a chartered jet on a route that goes over water the entire time , former @entity67 analyst @entity66 told @entity76			2
" leave @entity18 , " he told the @entity76			0
" fly north to the @entity77 , thence over to and through the @entity78			0
continue south , steering clear of @entity79 until getting to the east of the @entity81			0
fly through some convenient gap between islands and continue on to @entity60			0
" @entity84 , president of expert @entity85 , told @entity0 that such a route would probably work , as it avoids the airspace of any countries that may try to ground the plane			2
" that would probably be his only choice , " he said			0
such a flight would not come cheap -- about $ 200,000 -- @entity84 said			0
" where it gets more interesting is if they try to put him on an @entity99 flight nonstop to @entity100 , @entity101 , " he said			0
" the smart move would be to put him there as a passenger and hope nobody notices			0
" would other countries make a commercial passenger jet land if they believe @entity4 is on board ? given what happened to @entity112 president @entity111 , it 's possible , @entity84 said			1
opinion : why we 're all stuck in the digital transit zone with @entity4 no place to fly last week , several @entity118 countries would n't let @entity120 ' plane fly through their airspace , allegedly because of rumors that @entity4 was aboard			1
the presidential aircraft instead made an unscheduled stop in @entity125 , @entity126 , which became a sore spot for @entity120 and sparked outrage throughout @entity129			0
on tuesday , members of the @entity131 passed a resolution condemning the incident , calling for @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 to formally apologize			0
the @entity16 and @entity138 dissented			2
security clearance : no end in sight for @entity69 leak fallout as speculation swirled about @entity4 's next move , @entity33 took the @entity16 to task in a speech to military academy graduates , accusing @entity147 of persecuting @entity120 and threatening his life			1
" under those circumstances , several @entity129 countries have decided for dignity and as a clear message to the empire , that we 're not afraid of it , that the children of @entity159 do not fear the empire , " @entity33 said in a speech broadcast tuesday on @entity150 , a tv network based in @entity60			2
@entity162 administration keeps close watch officials in national security agencies and on @entity166 were watching closely wednesday for any signs that @entity4 was preparing to leave @entity18 for asylum in @entity26			1
some are questioning @entity33 's motivation , according to two @entity16 officials who declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the information involved			1
@entity16 officials believe @entity33 's decision to offer asylum to @entity4 is aimed more at boosting the @entity26 president 's standing at home rather than engaging in any direct @entity179 effort , according to an assessment by the @entity162 administration that the officials described to @entity0			1
@entity183 internet users back @entity4 @entity0 's @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 contributed to this report .			2

@entity147 analysis : @entity33 is pushing for *political* points in @entity26
@entity1 fuels speculation about @entity4 's next move
it 's unclear whether @entity4 has accepted any offer of asylum
the trick will be avoiding the airspace of the @entity16 and its allies
