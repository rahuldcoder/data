@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's wireless network will face major challenges " in the short term " unless the carrier is able to begin integrating @entity8 's infrastructure , said @entity4 ceo @entity10			1
he did n't specify an exact timeframe for when his company 's problems could compound but acknowledged that the network 's needs must be addressed in less than three years			1
@entity4 announced plans to acquire the @entity18 @entity8 unit from @entity19 on sunday in a $ 39 billion transaction			1
" with this deal , we 're set " for both the short and long haul , @entity10 said in a brief interview on tuesday			1
analysts predict that @entity4 could see major scrutiny from the regulating bodies that must approve the deal			1
however , it 's unclear how long that process might draw out			1
" one of the key drivers ( for the deal ) was the need for additional spectrum , " he said on a panel at the @entity34 conference			0
" it resolves the pending spectrum challenges that we 're facing in major cities			0
" wireless spectrum is the airwaves on which cellular signals travel			0
without enough spectrum , phone calls can get dropped and internet surfing can slow to a crawl when too many gadgets are trying to connect at the same time			0
people in the industry talk of an impending " spectrum crunch			0
" @entity56 chairman @entity55 dedicated a large part of his speech at this week 's mobile conference to the topic			2
" unleashing more spectrum must be a national priority , " he said			0
" every day we are not freeing up spectrum for mobile broadband is a day with real costs to our economy			0
" the @entity56 is one regulator , along with the @entity68 , that will review @entity4 's acquisition proposal			1
@entity55 declined in his speech to comment on the deal			0
he promoted the idea for broadcasters to auction their spectrum -- something he 's championed but has n't succeeded in implementing			2
however , @entity76 cto @entity75 is n't feeling a spectrum crunch			0
he said @entity76 secured ample airwaves at the @entity56 auction in 2008 , when the company spent an estimated $ 9.6 billion			0
" we bet pretty big with the 700 megahertz spectrum that we bought , and we feel that that gives us a very good path forward for @entity85 , " @entity75 said			0
" there is not a @entity76 spectrum concern in the short term			1
" at that same auction , @entity4 paid $ 6.6 billion , analysts said then , in addition to the $ 2.5 billion spent to acquire @entity92 earlier that year			1
@entity4 is positioning the @entity8 purchase as a proactive move to alleviate overflow in major cities			1
poor service quality in cities such as @entity99 and @entity100 has been a criticism lobbed at @entity4 over the past several years			1
@entity102 , the @entity4 executive , said he expects @entity76 will face issues down the road if it does n't continue to aggressively buy spectrum			2
" you wait and see , " he said			0
@entity76 's forecast determines that its network will be stable until 2015 before it will need to buy more or free up spectrum from its own holdings , @entity75 said			2
that 's despite @entity113 data usage being " a little bit higher than what we had expected , " he said			2
" we feel we 're in pretty good shape for the next three to four years			0
" @entity75 was also unimpressed with @entity4 's pledge to expand the rollout of its faster @entity85 network to 95 % of the @entity18 population from 80 % if federal regulators approve the @entity8 merger			1
" from my view , that 's old news , " @entity75 said of @entity4 's promise			1
@entity76 had set a deadline in 2013 for when its own version of that network technology will match its 3g coverage , which blankets about 97 % of @entity18			2
@entity76 's @entity85 began deployment in december , currently covers 59 cities and will add 88 more by the end of the year .			0

@entity4 ceo @entity10 says the network faces short - term problems
@entity8 's *assets* could alleviate the troubles @entity4 faces , he says
but @entity4 faces a *potentially* long regulatory approval process
