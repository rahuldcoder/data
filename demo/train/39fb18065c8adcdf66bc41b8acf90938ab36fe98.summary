-- few of us can imagine living the opulent " @entity5 " lives of the fictional @entity4 family at the turn of the 20th century			1
there were servants to address one 's every material need , dinner in white tie and lavish gowns , and rules designed to keep the upper crust on top and the lower classes in their place			1
you almost have to see the sprawling estate to believe that the lifestyle existed , yet the trip to visit @entity23 , the estate used by the television show in rural @entity25 , may cost more than the less well - to - do @entity26 can afford			1
there 's no need to cross the pond to get a taste of that life			2
although the @entity26 did not have lords or ladies living on grand estates , there were @entity26 millionaires who made their fortunes by harnessing the resources of a new country			1
with an eye to the style of their @entity43 counterparts , they built mansions on extensive grounds to show off their power and wealth			1
so if you 're entering a period of " @entity5 " withdrawal , consider a peek into @entity26 's historic high life			1
the places where masterpieces are born " these homes represented the creation of immense wealth at the turn of the century in the @entity26 , the kind of wealth acquired through fundamental commodities like water , gold , oil and food , " said @entity56 - @entity55 , the @entity58 's historic sites director of outreach , education and support			1
" these estates represented the taste and sophistication of their owners , as well as the skills and labors of those who built them and worked in them			1
these places were icons then and now , and they make for great television and fantastic places to visit as historic sites , because they contain all of those complex , compelling and interwoven stories			2
" the new @entity26 wealthy did n't have hundreds of years to build their fancy homes and reputations , yet the @entity92 , @entity93 and other wealthy families built houses to last for generations			1
these are just a handful of the homes where they were living large around the same time as the " @entity5 " story lines			1
@entity5 creates tourism boom the @entity93 : @entity103 , @entity104 with the economic engine that is @entity104 nearby , it makes sense that the country 's new wealthy would build their homes and country homes in the city 's suburbs and nearby @entity103			1
the @entity92 , roosevelts and @entity115 all had homes in the area			1
completed in 1913 , @entity118 was the home of @entity121 founder and philanthropist @entity122 and the next three generations of his family			2
the six - story home , now a @entity58 property operated by the @entity127 , is open to the public for tours			2
make sure to tour the gardens to see @entity104 gov. @entity132 's 20th - century sculpture collection , including the works of @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136			1
@entity118 's elaborate gardens also feature classical sculpture , pavilions , fountains and @entity142 views			1
the @entity144 family : @entity145 , @entity146 like the fictional @entity147 , the @entity144 family was touched by the sinking of the @entity149			2
although the @entity153 estate was built for wealthy widow @entity154 and her six children in 1886 , the @entity151 family lived there just 20 years			1
the @entity157 and @entity158 family and its descendants , known for @entity161 and @entity162 , lived there from 1906 to 1981			2
it was @entity157 's brother @entity165 who perished on the @entity149			2
reports say his wife , @entity167 , asked him to join her on a lifeboat			0
he replied , " no , i must be a gentleman " and went to join a group of men waiting for later lifeboats			0
his body was recovered later and identified by his monogrammed shirt			0
visitors can tour the 21 - room queen anne style mansion and grounds			1
the @entity177 : @entity178 , @entity179 the @entity182 - born owner of an ironworks company , @entity180 settled in @entity184 when he married @entity185 , the daughter of the founder of the @entity187			0
the @entity177 purchased a rundown farm in @entity178 to turn into their summer home and eventually built a new year - round home , @entity191 , which was completed in 1908			1
@entity180 became a leading patron of the @entity193 in the early 20th century , and it showed in the designs he chose for his home and the art he collected			1
the couple also started six education and arts institutions on their property , including the famous @entity202 while still alive , they deeded the house , much of its contents and the surrounding property to the @entity208 they created , living the rest of their lives not as owners but under a life trust at @entity191			0
it is the oldest surviving manor home in the metro @entity184 area			0
the @entity92 : @entity217 , @entity218 @entity219 did n't care for the city life as much as the rest of his family			0
so it was no surprise that after he visited the mountains of @entity218 , he eventually built his 250 - room estate in @entity217			2
the @entity227 was completed in 1895 , when he was still single			0
@entity92 married @entity229 in @entity230 in 1898 , and the couple raised their only child at @entity227			0
descendants of the @entity92 still own and operate the estate as a for - profit company , and the home is now open to the public for tours			0
there 's a 10,000 - volume library , a bowling alley , a banquet hall featuring a 70 - foot ceiling , an indoor pool and the artwork of @entity246 and @entity247 , among others			0
architect @entity249 modeled the house after three 16th - century @entity55 chateaux			2
with more than 30 bedrooms , it 's still shy of the 50 plus bedrooms at @entity5 's @entity23			0
still , @entity227 seems more than adequate for a house party			0
do n't miss the butler 's tour if you want to see how the other half lived on the estate			0
modern guests can stay at an inn built in 2001 or a historic cottage that once served as the gardener 's house			2
the @entity266 : @entity267 , @entity268 @entity269 was completed in 1917 as the country estate for mr. and mrs. @entity271 , @entity273 whose money came from water and gold			0
@entity269 is just 30 miles outside @entity277			0
the @entity43 influence can be found all over the property : @entity281 columns in the portico , art from the @entity266 ' travels to @entity43 and even some of the house 's walls			1
( the house library was copied from the library at @entity289 , a 1690s home in @entity25			0
) the expansive formal gardens were designed and constructed between 1917 and 1929			0
the next owners lived in the house until 1975 , when the house and formal gardens were donated to the @entity58			0
the @entity295 : @entity296 , @entity297 @entity5 fans might remember that the mother of @entity26 - born @entity300 , the countess of @entity302 , had a home in @entity296			1
that 's where rich @entity26 summered , and it 's where visitors can tour several grand homes at a time			1
mr. and mrs. @entity311 , who made their money in coal mining , built the @entity316 as their summer residence in @entity296			2
now one of the famous @entity319 and a @entity320 , the @entity316 was finished in 1901			0
unlike some residents of fictional @entity5 , who grudgingly adapted to modern conveniences like telephones and electricity , the @entity295 had the @entity316 outfitted with the latest modern conveniences			0
the house was among the first in @entity296 to be fully electrified with no gas backup			0
there was even an early ice maker			0
the couple 's art collection featured 18th - century @entity335 and @entity55 paintings and @entity337 ceramics			1
to get a good sense of life among the servants , the @entity319 , which owns and operates 10 historic properties in @entity296 , added an @entity342 last year .			2
