with only two nights left in the season , @entity2 claimed victory tuesday given its insurmountable lead			2
the win snaps @entity3 's unprecedented eight - year winning streak			1
@entity2 gets cocky : ' we are the center of the universe ' among total viewers , @entity2 has led the broadcast field for years , ranking no. 1 during 10 of the past 11 seasons			1
but this is the first time @entity2 has won in the 18 - 49 demo in 21 years			1

the network claims nine of the top 15 scripted primetime programs , including " @entity25 , " " @entity26 " and " @entity27			0
" during a press breakfast for reporters last week , @entity2 ceo @entity28 relished the current standings			2
yet @entity2 only deserves partial credit for its ranking			0

but it was @entity3 declining 22 percent due to softening " @entity46 " popularity and other factors that gave @entity2 the trophy			1

" @entity3 unveils fall schedule the rest : @entity60 slipped slightly this season			2
but if you were to remove the @entity21 from its average last year , @entity60 would have actually been up thanks to " @entity65 " boosting its fall ( and despite a rather spectacular midseason ratings crash )			0
