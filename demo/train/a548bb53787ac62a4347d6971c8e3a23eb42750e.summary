-- when waking up this morning in @entity1 , one could be forgiven for not knowing that @entity1 celebrity magazine closer had crossed the @entity3 and published topless pictures of @entity5 , wife of prince @entity6 , heir to the @entity7			2
no mention on early morning radio shows or television news bulletins , nothing on the national daily newspapers ' websites			0
it is in fact the @entity17 furore over the publication which slowly made @entity1 aware of the shocking faux pas			1
in an interesting cultural twist , the @entity17 media suddenly discussed the outrageous breach of the @entity24 ' privacy by @entity1 photographers , invoking the fate of late princess @entity27 in @entity28 , at the hands of @entity1 paparazzi			1
@entity17 commentators seemed to be forgetting a little too quickly perhaps that @entity17 boasts the most intrusive tabloid and celebrity press in @entity34 , one which never shies away from divulging , and often making up , stories about public figures ' intimacy			1
and while there is a right to privacy in @entity17 under the human rights act , the law is much stricter in @entity1			1
in that country , privacy laws protect people from such intrusion and there is no doubt that if the @entity49 and @entity5 do sue , they 're likely to win their case			1
only last week , @entity51 , partner of @entity1 president @entity52 , won a string of cases against publications having showed her in a bikini this summer			2
however , the rise of the celebrity press in @entity1 since the introduction in 2005 of magazines such as @entity61 , -- the @entity1 edition is published by @entity64 company @entity63 , part of the @entity67 empire -- has proved that @entity1 readers have a taste for gossip too			2
with a weekly circulation of 400 000 , closer is a natural heir to @entity1 's first gossip magazine , @entity76 - owned @entity75 introduced in 1981			0
many in @entity17 may add that @entity1 has in fact a much older tradition : look at @entity80 , the world 's oldest celebrity magazine			1
@entity80 , a political and current affairs magazine , has indeed a keen interest for public personalities , but keeps away from the salacious unlike publications such as @entity61			0
@entity80 also publishes serious political reportages			0
the problem of the celebrity press in @entity1 lies in the fact that magazines such as @entity61 , knowing all too well they 'll be condemned and fined for invading people 's lives , take it into account from the beginning and provision all legal costs in advance			2
in short , their success is such that they can afford paying hefty fines every week			0
they also tend to target foreign personalities , @entity104 or @entity17 , as their lives have already been invaded by sister publications in their respective countries and they are less inclined to sue			1
@entity1 celebrities whose privacy has been invaded tend to react , fast and furious , and sue straight away , well aware of their rights			1
no doubt , the @entity1 public at large will have sympathy for the royal couple especially as their intimacy was breached in @entity1 while they were having some time off before embarking on a tour of @entity116 on behalf of the @entity117			0
as a nation as a whole , they value privacy and everyone 's right to it , powerful or not			0
however , they may take the @entity17 media 's attacks less kindly and brand it hypocritical			1
they remember how , only just a few weeks ago , @entity129 's @entity128 justified publishing the pictures of a naked prince @entity131 in a @entity133 luxury hotel in the name " of public interest			0
" if the @entity17 media is keen to protect the young royal couple from the paparazzi 's glare , perhaps they could start at home			1
a spokesman from @entity143 declared : " we believe a red line has been crossed			0
" the red line is crossed every time somebody 's privacy is invaded , royal or not			0
after @entity27 : why no privacy in @entity1 ?			2

@entity151 : @entity17 commentators forget @entity17 boasts most intrusive press in @entity34
in @entity1 stricter privacy laws protect people from such intrusion , she says
@entity160 : " @entity1 celebrities whose privacy has been invaded tend to sue straight away "
@entity1 value privacy but may see @entity17 media attacks as hypocritical , she says
