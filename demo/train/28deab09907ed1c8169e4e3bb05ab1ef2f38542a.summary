-- for the @entity2 of @entity3 , @entity4 , the canoe slalom event at the @entity1 will be a family affair			1
@entity7 , who is competing in the men 's kayak class , will not just be trying to impress his father , who coaches him , or his brother and sister , who will be watching from the crowd			1
he will also need to ensure he does n't incur the disapproval of his mother , @entity15 , who is one of the judges at the event			1
the idea of a mother officiating in a competition in which her son is participating may strike some as a little unfair , but the @entity2 and the @entity4 @entity23 are eager to stress there 's no scope for special treatment in this case			1
" the only real advantage mum can give me is her presence at what will be my biggest race ever , " said @entity7 , who is competing in the @entity1 for the first time after finishing 16th in the canoe slalom world championships in @entity30 last year			1
the event involves the kayakers flinging themselves down a steep course of white - water rapids , weaving through a series of gates like slalom skiers in a race against the clock			2
if the competitors touch or miss a gate , they suffer a time penalty			0
each gate has a judge watching out for errors , and a chief official oversees the entire course			0
as one of the gate judges , @entity53 has an important role , but her decisions will be scrutinized by other officials -- each gate judge also monitors the two gates on either side			1
competitors ' runs are reviewed on video , and the chief official has the final say			0
" i ca n't envisage any way a single gate judge could influence the outcome for any athlete , " said @entity67 , the secretary general of the @entity4 @entity23			1
" @entity15 is a very experienced international judge			2
" the @entity72 , which selected her as the only judge from @entity4 for the @entity75 event , agrees			2
in the past few years , @entity53 has officiated at canoe slalom world championships and world cups in which her 25 - year - old son has raced			1
the @entity72 has " a strong officiating process in place to ensure accuracy and fairness at all its competitions , whether it is at world cups , world championships or at the @entity75 , " said @entity86 , a spokeswoman for the federation			0
she noted that some judges at the event have the same nationality as some competitors			0
" that could equally be thought to create a conflict of interest , " she said			0
" however , the judging process is thorough and stringent and does not provide any possibility for a single individual to affect the outcome of a competitor 's run			0
" despite the multitude of officials at the canoe slalom event , the role of individual judges is still significant , @entity53 has said			1
" when officiating the athlete and 100 % accuracy is always the focus , one poor call can mean the difference between a top - 10 finish and chance of a medal or being out of the competition , " she wrote in an article on the @entity4 federation 's website in february			2
relationships with family and friends do n't enter the equation , though , she says			0
" i 've been officiating for a number of years now and know a lot of the athletes , so it is easy to put aside any personal emotions when i 'm on the course , " @entity53 said in comments relayed by the @entity72 on wednesday			0
" several of the top men 's slalom paddlers have stayed with us in @entity4 while they 've been training with @entity7 and i owe it to all of them to do the most professional job possible , " she added			1
@entity7 , who was born and raised in the @entity135 of @entity4 , says the best way for him to stamp out any perceptions of favoritism is to not make any mistakes			2
" if i 'm paddling well , the gate judges wo n't come into play at all , " he said			1
he is not the only @entity142 competing in the canoe slalom : @entity144 , also from @entity3 , became the first @entity4 woman to compete in the kayak competition in the @entity1 after qualifying for the @entity147			1
@entity148 will be her second @entity1 , at the age of just 23			0
for @entity7 , the @entity75 are full of new experiences			0
" we 've been in the @entity152 for a few days and it 's pretty cool , " @entity7 said			2
" i can see how people get intimidated , but really it 's just like a hotel with an epic food court			0

@entity7 is competing in the men 's kayak event at the @entity1
his mother , @entity15 , is one of the judges at the event
the @entity2 and the @entity4 @entity23 say she ca n't influence the result
she is one of many gate judges over the canoe slalom course
