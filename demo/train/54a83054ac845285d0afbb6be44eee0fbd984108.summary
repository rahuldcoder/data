@entity0 -- a pre-teen me once learned how to slow dance to " @entity5			1
" picture a middle school auditorium circa 1987			0
i was that retainer - wearing girl at the school dance , clumsily shuffling along to the @entity9 classic with a nervous boy about a full arms - length away from me			1
it was an awkward moment , yet my heart still flutters when i hear those harmonies			0
so when i learned @entity1 's @entity15 had booked the @entity9 for an interview in @entity0 , i jumped at the chance to interview @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
blog : @entity22 they 're currently on their 50th anniversary tour around the world			1
@entity26 and @entity27 passed away long ago , but the band includes three original members -- @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 -- as well as @entity30 and @entity31 , who joined the band in 1965			1
on tour , they 're serenading fans with favorites like " @entity36 " and " @entity37 , " as well as a delightfully fresh new single , " @entity38			1
" although their new song is about a technology the band is nostalgic about , the @entity9 are not stuck in the past			1
incredibly , after half a century of recording and performing , they are not a tribute band to their 20 - something selves			2
they 're still crafting those richly complex harmonic sounds			2
they 're still hitting all those notes			0
and they 're still capturing the sweet , adolescent purity of " @entity5			0
" " @entity5 , " released in 1963 , marked @entity20 's emergence as a producer			1
he tells me , " i wanted to do something original that was inspired by the @entity56			0
when @entity57 and the guys came to my house one day , i learned how to arrange the chords			0
' @entity5 ' was the first song i ever learned how to make harmonies to a song			0
" three years later , @entity20 would produce " @entity64 " -- considered by @entity66 magazine as his " ultimate triumph as a producer , and one of the most innovative pop hits of the @entity71			1
" " the night we cut the vocals was one of the highlights of my life , " says @entity20			1
" it was a departure from anything we 've ever done before			0
" @entity9 did the background orchestration in five different studios			1
@entity20 tells me the production took little more than a month			1
not so fast , claims @entity18 : " we were re-doing things endlessly until they were perfect because of him , ' mr. @entity86 ' ( pointing at @entity20 ) here			1
so it took more like six months ! " " @entity64 " is a multi-layered pop symphony with nearly everything thrown in -- sleigh bells , cello , harpsichord , even a theremin -- one of the earliest electronic instruments			1
as @entity20 puts it , " my brother @entity95 said , ' why do n't you use a theremin ? ' i said , ' what for ? ' and he goes , ' i do n't know			2
' " i came up with the ' @entity100 ' ( he mimics the theremin sound )			0
it was a scary record actually			0
it was a good scary			0
" like a roller coaster , " @entity64 " twists and turns like a joyride of sound			2
and the boys all agree , it is their masterpiece			0
" they are all masterpieces , " says @entity112 ' full playlist			0
" but the one that is commercially successful and brilliant musically ... is ' @entity64			2
' " half a century on , the @entity9 are still creating new music that captures the emotional thrills of youth			2
" we feel these emotions as if we were kids , " says @entity18			2
" we still have them inside of us			0
" @entity19 adds , " the harmony is timeless ... as long as you can get those notes and create those sounds together , then there is a timeless factor			2
" when the interview wraps , @entity20 is the first to rip off his microphone			1
he kindly agrees to pose for a photo with me , and -- after a handshake -- leaves the room			0
@entity19 and @entity18 then take to a small nearby stage and strike up an impromptu version of " @entity36 " ( with @entity18 on bass and @entity19 doing vocals )			1
@entity31 then appears out of nowhere to play the piano			0
and then it hits me , i 'm being serenaded by @entity9			2
and inside , i 'm screaming like a giddy 12 year old			0
but where was @entity20 ? " off to a buffet somewhere , " quips @entity19 with a smile			1
and why not ? he has to feed the muse .			0
