@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's fate hangs in the balance			1
the @entity7 man convicted for the 1988 @entity9 bombings has terminal prostate cancer and , according to his lawyers , just weeks to live			1
mourners at the 20th anniversary memorial service for the victims of the @entity9 bombing			1
@entity1 's justice minister @entity16 is weighing up whether to release him on compassionate grounds so he can die at home ; to transfer him to a @entity7 jail under a prisoner transfer agreement drawn up between @entity7 and the @entity21 ; or whether to keep him in a @entity1 jail for the rest of his days			1
that is certainly the preferred option of the @entity26 secretary of state @entity27 who last week wrote to mr @entity16 urging him not to send @entity4 home			1
in @entity9 itself , matters of politics seem far removed			1
@entity34 was one of the first policemen on the scene when the @entity37 crashed into @entity38			1
" i 've never talked about the politics of the thing because i had no interest , " he says			0
" people here are n't interested in the politics , they just want to carry on with their lives			0
" @entity34 has vivid memories of the night of december 21 , 1988 -- the " shortest and darkest night of the year , " he says			1
" the houses were just slowly burning and more houses were catching fire			0
the windows were popping , the gutters were burning , everything was burning			0
i remember seeing a wrought iron gate in the distance and i remember it was dripping like molten butter , drip drip dripping away			0
" at first @entity34 thought it was a military aircraft which had crashed into the town			1
then he heard that the nose cone of a 747 had landed in a field three miles from @entity9 and he knew that he was dealing with far greater numbers of dead			1
" we were told about the 747 , " he says , " and we realized we were n't looking for twenty people but for 300			0
but where were they ? " there is a small memorial room beside the little church of @entity0 , across the road from where the nose cone landed			0
inside are inscriptions from visitors commemorating the huge loss of life and photographs of each of the 270 people who died in the @entity9 bombing			2
" @entity88 " reads one of the inscriptions from a family member who lost a loved one			0
" some say the land there is now tainted , i say it is blessed			2
" in the field itself there are no marks to suggest where the nose cone landed			0
the local farmer points to the horizon across the rolling @entity1 hills			1
" between here and the top of the hill , here on my father 's farm , we found 120 bodies , " he says			2
the force of the explosion and the wind that night blew bits of the plane , personal possessions and body parts across a vast area			0
@entity119 , and hundreds of policemen and other volunteers combed 845 square meters of land looking for clues as to what brought the plane down			1
documents from the plane were even discovered in the @entity128 , 60 miles away			0
the crucial piece of evidence that implicated @entity4 was a scrap of clothing wrapped around a part of the device used to detonate the suitcase bomb			2
it was traced back to a @entity138 boutique whose shop - owner recognized @entity4			2
@entity9 local @entity141 said he was never entirely convinced of @entity4 's guilt			1
" i did feel that some of the evidence was circumstantial , " he says			0
" i think partly out of compassion and partly out of a possible element of doubt , he should be allowed out			0
" as he looks down @entity38 at the neat rows of houses , not yet twenty years old , he says : " @entity151 and once a tragedy like this is over people pick up the threads of their lives			2
and they do n't forget but they do n't dwell on it			0
because there 's no earthly point in dwelling on any of this			2
" 270 people from 21 nations lost their lives in the beautiful hills around @entity9			2
some of them had been so badly incinerated no trace of them was ever found , just their personal belongings and the @entity171 passenger list which proved they 'd been on board			0
twenty years later in the town of @entity9 , the streets have been rebuilt , the past buried , but not forgotten .			1
