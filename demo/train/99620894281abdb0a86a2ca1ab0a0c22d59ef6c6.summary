-- once again we see the scenario unfold : a powerful man , with tremendous responsibilities , apparently " caught " in a compromising sexual situation with a woman who is not his wife			2
there is the now - familiar ritual of the threats of embarrassing revelations of intimate conversations , the hunted - down " other woman " who either decides to tell more or not , the nationwide harrumphing and moralizing , and the schadenfreude - stoking musings over the humiliations of the loyal wife			0
and of course , there is the spectacle of another career -- in @entity26 ' case , one that distinguished him in his service to our country -- in tatters			1
but while the media tell a familiar narrative of misjudgment and temptation , to me this story is about the terrifying power of the @entity38 , married to the terrifying power of the resurrected @entity40 -- and combined with a lethal admixture of our nation 's @entity42 , prurience about and ignorance regarding sexuality			1
what happened to @entity26 -- and the recent slew of other powerful men or men threatening to some power blocs , from @entity53 to @entity54 ? they were surveilled by political elites in an increasingly intrusive surveillance society , and exposed			1
opinion : must one lose a job over infidelity ? we should understand that the surveillance that keeps tripping up these powerful men is not something about which only heads of state , whistle - blower publishers or generals have to worry			1
it also includes others in which the allegations of what initiated their downfall are more complex and serious , such as @entity74 and @entity75			0
because of the @entity38 , any of us , if we annoy or threaten powerful interests , can have our e-mails read without our knowledge			1
any of us can be subject to a search that could lead from one e-mail correspondent to another until the @entity83 or the @entity84 , which have both confirmed that they have invested heavily in domestic surveillance of social networks , find something -- anything -- that could be seen as compromising			2
at that point , any of us can be subjected to terrible pressure -- even legal threats -- if what is uncovered can be in any way described as " classified information			0
" we live at a time in which our government is vastly over-classifying subjects in the name of public interest or that might embarrass the state			2
@entity102 forbid if anyone provides " material support " for the enemy , which is so vague a term that president @entity109 's own lawyers confirmed to judge @entity110 , in my presence during the @entity114 hearing on the @entity115 this past spring , that it can be used to include basic journalism about , for instance , the @entity119 , or other information the government simply does not wish exposed			2
any of us can be threatened with possessing classified information			0
this is why @entity124 has spent months in solitary confinement in prison			0
we can be threatened with the @entity40			1
this is why @entity75 is hiding in the @entity128			0
if @entity75 were convicted of receiving classified information , and extradited under the @entity40 , he could theoretically be shipped to @entity129 -- for which some congressional voices have called			1
but that precedent casts a shadow over everyone who might have ever heard about or discussed classified information -- something that is routine in @entity136			0
there are still many unknowns to the @entity26 story			1
maybe it really is just about the @entity141 and the @entity84 being very , very worried about @entity26 sleeping with his biographer			1
but we do n't need to buy into this theater			0
if there is a national security breach -- which would be a real issue if one took place -- that can be investigated and addressed without spectacle or bullying			0
opinion : blame affairs on evolution of sex roles in working with these two appalling laws , we need to understand what loss of privacy means : any of us can be brought down , intimidated , silenced , threatened , by exposure of our personal lives , for any reason			1
we all have secrets we do not wish made public			0
any of us can be threatened with exposure of infidelity , or sex addiction , or flirtatious communications , or addiction to embarrassing pornographic images , or alcoholism or bipolar disorder , or even our discussions with our doctors , psychiatrists or accountants -- about our most personal information			2
it is hard to imagine fully what the loss of sexual privacy means to private life -- and to the human condition			1
in the film " @entity183 , " set in @entity184 before the @entity185 came down , the state listened in on lovers doing what lovers do : quarrelling , engaging in highly intimate acts of desire and passion , and sometimes , yes , betraying their spouses			2
but what is clear from the depiction is that whatever private pain such betrayal as infidelity causes , the general pain and the deadening quality for everyone , of living in a society in which there is no privacy -- and no sexual privacy -- is far , far more destructive and more distorting of the human condition			1
sexual privacy is absolutely necessary for human beings to have basic dignity , and that includes the space to make mistakes or do things one may regret			1
a third of couples , husbands and wives , report that they have committed infidelity			0
what if all of those marriages were subject to surveillance and exposure ? what if the power regarding who tells you that your spouse has betrayed you , becomes not a private struggle in private life , but a matter for the state to decide ? and how many people in marriages that might have survived an infidelity , might have their lives and relationships further shattered by the state , as it can do now , from knowing the details of every single e-mail or credit card record or gift ? finally , add to this toxic mess @entity42 and prurience			1
it is easy to look at what seems to be a man , a mistress and a furious wife , and to assume that one knows all about what has gone on			0
but often such situations are complex			0
women commit adultery as often as men do , though the media are full of stories asking : why do men cheat ? indeed , women initiate divorce more often than men do			0
female unhappiness in intimate relationships is rife in @entity265 , because of some basic misunderstandings of female desire that i have detailed in my new book			0
it is not our place to judge and condemn , or to cast the first stone			0
a new understanding of the dangers of the @entity38 and @entity40 acts should show us why it is more important than ever for couples to be permitted to experience the pain and betrayal of a possible infidelity in private , without the power of the state breathing down the necks of all involved			1
of course , there is no way ever to justify an infidelity -- betrayal is always wrong			0
one can not know from the outside what kind of sexual or emotional loneliness may have been part of any given marriage , what kinds of demons any one of us might struggle with			0
understanding the toxic sexual culture in which @entity265 marriages try to thrive should lead us , at least , to see such breakdowns without snap judgments			2
and understanding the role of a surveillance society in the state 's choosing which adulterers to go after should give us pause about joining into to any theatrics of public condemnation			1
unless there was a serious state security issue in relation to this infidelity , what happened between @entity26 and @entity313 should be , personally speaking , the equivalent of classified information : in other words , absolutely none of our business			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity321 .			2

@entity321 : we live in an increasingly intrusive surveillance society
@entity325 says for her , @entity26 story is about terrifying power of @entity38 and @entity40 acts
she says loss of sexual privacy would be destructive to the human condition
@entity325 : we should not rush to judge marriages and those who commit infidelity
