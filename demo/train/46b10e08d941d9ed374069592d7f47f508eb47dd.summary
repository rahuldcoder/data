-- the license plates on our police escorts ' land cruisers read " @entity5 , @entity6			1
" many of those we meet during our stay in @entity10 , northeast @entity11 , smile bitterly at the irony of that statement			1
the state 's capital is now better known as the birthplace of @entity17 and peace here is always uncertain			1
down the dusty streets we drive , passing checkpoint after checkpoint manned not by soldiers but civilians , mostly armed with little more than machetes and swords			0
these vigilante groups , driven by a determination and motivation that the @entity11 security forces largely lack , have managed to establish some semblance of security in @entity10			1
their pursuit of @entity17 has become relentless -- hardened as they are by losses to the terror group over the years -- and they show no mercy , not even to family			1
watch : @entity40 for @entity17 focuses on @entity41 " i caught him with my hand and handed him over to the authority , " one of the sector 's leaders , @entity45 , tells us unapologetically			1
he is speaking about his 16 - year - old nephew , who he says was with @entity17			1
" he has been executed , " @entity45 informs us , without a hint of remorse on his face			0
" he was like my son , i have no regret			0
" what started as a home - grown movement for @entity60 law in northern @entity11 is now a full - scale insurgency			1
@entity17 attacks have terrorized this part of the country for years , but their kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls in @entity67 in april has brought them an unprecedented level of international infamy			1
since then the insurgents , seemingly galvanized by the attention , have stepped up the frequency and brazenness of its attacks on villages in the region			0
a presidential fact - finding mission is in @entity10 at the same time as our trip			2
each morning we receive word that they will travel to @entity67 ; each morning the residents and parents of the girls stolen from @entity67 wait ; and each afternoon everyone is disappointed by another postponement			0
one woman , who is part of the mission and asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation , told us that she would be quitting " [ the parents ] need to know that the nation is with them , that people are with them , " she said emotionally			0
" but there are people that would n't let us even call them			0
they keep saying it 's security and that 's why we ca n't go , but some of us are willing to risk it			2
" more than six weeks after the kidnapping , the @entity11 government and its forces have done little to ease the agony of the girls ' parents and those who have rallied behind the cause			1
last week , officials banned all protests in support of the " @entity118 " campaign , calling them " lawless , " before reversing tack in the face of a public outcry			2
traveling outside of @entity10 is a risk , and our time on the ground is limited by security concerns			0
just twenty minutes outside the city limits we find entire villages empty after recent attacks			2
@entity10 may be @entity17 's birthplace , but its terror is spreading			1
refugees have been flowing into neighboring countries , where borders exist in name only , and each person has a harrowing tale of escape , a heartbreaking story of loss from which few will recover			0
the @entity144 ( @entity144 ) estimates that as many as 1,000 refugees a week are crossing the border into @entity148 's @entity147			1
four out of five are women and girls			0
the @entity144 estimates that if the violence continues in northern @entity11 , up to 100,000 refugees could be living in @entity147 by the end of the year			1
orphaned by @entity17 all that 14 - year - old @entity154 and her little sister @entity155 , 12 , have of their former life in @entity11 are tattered photos of their parents			1
@entity154 curls up and buries her face , her shoulders shuddering with each silent sob			0
@entity155 seems to have utterly internalized her pain , and speaks in a numb monotone			0
they tell us they want to go back to @entity10 , but for now they ca n't			0
they are orphans -- their mother died of natural causes before they can remember , and their father was killed in a @entity17 attack about five months ago			1
we find them living with their aunt on a small plot in @entity147 , @entity148 , uncertain about a future they are now forced to navigate alone			2
" she [ @entity154 ] ca n't understand how this could have happened , " the @entity144 's @entity180 , explains			2
" she is a victim going through a psychological trauma , she needs protection			0
" there are no refugee camps in @entity147 , and @entity11 fleeing across the border have been absorbed into the local populations			1
the @entity188 is helping to ease the burden on host families by providing aid to the refugees , but it only has a quarter of the money it needs for its @entity148 programs , according to the country 's @entity188 director			1
on the outskirts of town , the village of @entity200 's population has doubled			2
its new residents all come from a @entity11 village located 3 kilometers from the border			1
many fled a @entity17 attack in the middle of the night and spent the night hiding in the bush before crossing the river into @entity148			1
@entity213 tells us how she came across her brother 's lifeless body in the middle of her escape			2
he had been dragged out of a mosque , executed with his prayer beads still in his hand			0
" the only thing i could think in that moment was ' survive , ' " @entity213 often tells us			0
her walk to @entity148 took just thirty minutes			2
here , the border is more an idea than a reality			0
a shallow river along the edge of @entity200 marks the line between relative safety and terror			0
but fear continues to haunt people who cross it			0
few dare to even utter the words " @entity17 , " as if merely calling the group by name will bring the same violence and terror across the border as well			1
local government officials in @entity148 refuse to speak about security , and brusquely warn us not to ask about it and to stick to our pre-planned program			1
@entity249 and @entity11 security sources tell us @entity17 tends to use @entity148 as more of a logistics hub or to escape military operations in @entity11			1
there have been concerns that fighters are hiding themselves among the refugees , and recruiting among @entity148 's disgruntled unemployed youth -- a concern shared by @entity11 's other neighbors as @entity17 morphs into a transnational terrorist organization			1
the journey to @entity41 we leave @entity147 in the morning , along tracks barely visible in the sand			0
we travel in a convoy through the remote , unforgiving landscape			0
pickup trucks stacked high with cargo pass us in the opposite direction , laboring over the dunes			0
our driver tells us they 're carrying dried fish from @entity41			0
sources tell us the lake is an area of interest in the search for the missing @entity11 schoolgirls			1
bordered by @entity148 , @entity11 , @entity279 , and @entity41 , islands now cover half of the once - massive lake as its waters continue to recede			1
it is an ideal hideout for @entity17			2
in march , along the area of the lake just south of where we are headed , @entity11 forces raided a @entity17 camp , capturing weapons , ammunition and explosives			1
but for the most part , these are lawless waters			0
we leave the port of @entity295 , but not before hearing more stories of another town dealing with the influx of refugees			0
it seems no one and no place here is lucky enough to escape the effects of @entity17 's brutal campaign			1
we charter a fishing boat and head out on the water			0
we travel as far as we 're told we can safely go , then land on one of the islands closest to @entity148			2
all we can see is dense vegetation along the shoreline			0
inland , we find a small fishing village			0
the village leader , @entity314 , tells us he and many others here lived on one of the islands closer to @entity11			2
one day , @entity17 arrived on what was essentially a shopping trip -- but before they left with all of the produce and food , @entity321 says they torched all of the homes and killed so many villagers that he says he lost count			2
this is just one of the many horrifying tales about @entity17 that we hear during our time in @entity148			1
it makes us think of all the stories we have n't heard from the countless victims of the last few years when the group has operated with impunity			2
before we came to @entity41 , we 'd met two informants in @entity11 who live among @entity17 members and know the terrorist organization 's tactics better than most			1
we ask them what the group has planned for the kidnapped schoolgirls			2
" they will use them to negotiate with the government about those of their members that have been detained by the government , " one tells us			0
" or they will use them as human shields			0
" as we sail through the waters back to the mainland , it becomes clear just how challenging a search and rescue operation will be			0
the terrain here is as harsh as @entity17 's tactics are unforgiving			1
