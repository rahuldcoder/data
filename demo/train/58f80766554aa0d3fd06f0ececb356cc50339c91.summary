@entity0 -- @entity3 's ordeal started last august when a man burst into her room and tied a fake bomb around her neck , and ended on tuesday when he was sentenced to at least 10 years in jail			1
the @entity10 teenager was studying for her final year exams when 52 - year - old @entity3 broke into her suburban @entity13 home and carried out what the prosecution called an act of " urban terrorism			1
" " the terror instilled can only be described as unimaginable , " judge @entity18 told the @entity19 in @entity13 during sentencing tuesday			1
@entity3 was in the courtroom , as were her parents , and the man who , on a wednesday afternoon , pushed open their unlocked front door and found the 18 - year - old student alone in her bedroom			1
armed with a baseball bat and wearing a multi-colored balaclava , he told the frightened teenager to sit on the bed while he fixed a bicycle lock attached to a black box around her neck			1
according to court documents , as @entity3 walked away , @entity3 asked him where we was going			1
" count to two hundred ... i 'll be back ... if you move i can see you , i 'll be right here , " he replied			0
around her neck was also two - page typed note and a usb stick in a plastic sleeve			1
after a few minutes @entity3 yelled out			1
she texted her parents : call the police			2
then she read the note			0
" powerful new technology plastic explosives are located inside the small black combination case delivered to you			0
the case is booby trapped			0
it can only be opened safely , if you follow the instructions and comply with its terms and conditions			0
" with one look at the word " explosives " she knew what was around her neck			2
call the police , she begged			2
the note went on : " if you disclose these instructions , future instructions , any correspondence , remittance instructions enclosures , direction or any other relevant fact outlined here or elsewhere , to any @entity78 or @entity79 agency , the police or @entity80 , or to any non-family member , it will trigger an immediate @entity83 event			2
" @entity3 phoned her father back			1
do n't call the police			2
sitting alone in her bedroom , @entity3 was presumably waiting for what would come first , the police or the blast			1
when officers arrived they " found the victim in a hysterical state and crying uncontrollably , " court documents state			0

he was forced to wear the device by co-conspirators in a bank heist			0
it exploded as he sat in a parking lot soon after being stopped by police			0
@entity3 was only in the house for a matter of minutes , but it would take police nine hours to determine that the box contained no explosives , and 10 hours to remove it			1
the entire time @entity3 supported the box with her hands for fear it may explode			2
outside the court tuesday , @entity3 expressed relief at the sentencing			1
" i am pleased with today 's outcome and that i can now look to a future without @entity125 ' name being linked to mine , " she told the assembled media			0
behind the events of that day is the tragic unraveling of a once successful man 's life , from an international career in finance to divorce and a heavy drinking problem , where the lines between fact and fiction became increasingly blurred			2
according to court documents , @entity3 was an above average student who left university with a double degree in law and economics			2
he had a successful career in @entity0 , where he grew up , before moving to the @entity101 with his second wife and young family to take a high - level position with a @entity101 firm			0
promoted to be managing director of the same firm , he " achieved substantial financial rewards and maintained a high lifestyle			0
" however , around six years ago , his marriage broke down			0
his wife filed for divorce and told him that he would n't see his children again			0
according to court documents , @entity3 told one of three psychiatrists asked to examine him that " that is where the story really starts			2
" disillusioned with the banking industry , @entity3 moved back to @entity161 and started writing a book			2
initially it was a historical novel set in @entity0 , but morphed into a tale of revenge featuring a character called " @entity167			0
" @entity3 told the examining psychiatrist that he as became more involved in his book he took on @entity167 's persona			1
according to court documents , " he said the suburb of @entity172 was like the @entity0 peak and he wanted to create in his own mind what the nemesis in his book could have been doing			0
" during sentencing , the judge debunked suggestions that @entity3 was motivated by a confused reality and said the motive , beyond reasonable doubt , was extortion			1
" the offender intended to place the very young victim in fear that she was going to be killed in order to ensure compliance with the directions in the demand			0
the offender did so in order to extort money from the victim , " judge @entity192 said			0
the plan ultimately failed , the judge said , because police were called , the media was alerted , and @entity3 decided to abandon his efforts to extort money			1
five days after entering the house , @entity3 flew from @entity13 to @entity203 before boarding a connecting flight to @entity205 , @entity206			1
he was arrested there on august 15 and later extradited to @entity10			0
it remains unclear why @entity3 targeted an 18 - year - old girl and it would be " unproductive to speculate , " said judge @entity192			1
outside the court , @entity211 said of his daughter : " @entity214 is a very , very special young lady who has handled herself with incredible poise and dignity			0
we 're unbelievably proud of her			0
" @entity3 was sentenced to 13 years and six months in prison , with a non-parole period of 10 years .			1
