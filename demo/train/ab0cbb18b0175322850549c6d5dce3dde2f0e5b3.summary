-- @entity1 has been a household name since before he was old enough to drive			1
we listened as his voice changed and watched him trade in his purple hoodies and signature swoopy hair for low - riding pants and a more voluminous ' do			0
the 19 - year - old pop star is one of many celebrities who 've grown up under the proverbial microscope , where the simplest rites of passage -- like grabbing your girlfriend 's backside during a passionate make - out session -- are headline fodder			1
it 's nothing we have n't seen before			2
stars like @entity21 and @entity22 would likely agree that the transition from teen sensation to adult icon is seldom seamless			1
for whatever reason , @entity1 might have considered himself to be an exception			1
" i think i 'll make a smooth transition from a teen star to an adult star , " he told @entity28 in 2011			1
" i do n't want to grow up too quickly and do anything that 's not smart			2
" two years later , 2013 is shaping up to be that fateful time in the @entity36 - born star 's career			1
in january he was seen holding what sites identified as marijuana in one photograph , while another showed him getting handsy with a female fan			0
earlier this month , @entity1 had his " worst birthday , " and angered fans when he was late to the stage for a sold - out show at @entity47 's @entity46			1
the most recent @entity1 news is n't any more flattering			1
according to authorities , the singer 's neighbor is accusing him of " battery and threats " after a confrontation took place outside his @entity58 home on tuesday			0
as the @entity60 pointed out after the " girlfriend " singer 's 18th birthday last year , " mr. @entity1 can be his own man , sure , so long as he continues to belong to everyone else too			1
" despite rejecting comparisons to @entity65 , @entity1 would be lucky to moonwalk into adulthood the way the " @entity69 " singer has			1
of course , @entity65 had the support of his boy band ' @entity71 behind him when he made the leap			0
it also helped that there were other male stars around , like the @entity77 , helping to dim the harsh limelight			0
@entity1 does n't exactly have a counterpart today			1
while " @entity86 " stars @entity81 and @entity82 , or " @entity87 " stars @entity83 and @entity85 , have distracted the media -- and countless tween fans -- @entity1 remains in a league of his own			1
every step of her own maturation -- from the time she danced with a pole at the @entity98 , to her drastic haircut in 2012 -- has made headlines			0
the " @entity107 " singer and " @entity110 " actress issued a public apology after a video surfaced of her smoking salvia ( an herb sold legally in many health food stores ) in 2010			0
" but do you really think it was a mistake ? " @entity114 's @entity113 asked @entity92 in a 2011 interview			2
" obviously college kids your age all over @entity118 are smoking bongs with a lot more than salvia in them			0
" " but they 're not @entity92 , " she said			0
" they 're not role models			0
so for me it was a bad decision , because of my fans and because of what i stand for			0
" @entity92 is getting older , but she 's not in and out of court ( no offense , @entity134 ) , or getting into car wreck after car wreck ( no offense , @entity138 ) , so is n't the " good girl gone bad " label pushing it ? another former @entity142 princess who 's growing up in the public eye is @entity1 's former girlfriend , @entity141			1
the singer - actress is attempting to shed her @entity142 image ( without muddying her squeaky - clean off - screen persona ) by co-starring in the raucous crime dramedy " @entity148			0
" @entity149 has n't taken nearly as much heat as @entity92 , though she has shown a fair amount of side boob with her red carpet choices of late			0
despite the age - old idea that each generation is more reckless than the last , @entity1 and his famous peers do n't appear to be rebelling so much as they 're just getting older			2
@entity157 , whose son @entity158 is friends with @entity1 , recently took to her @entity161 page to express her frustrations with the way young stars are treated : " is it okay to continually attack and criticize ( @entity1 ) a famous 19 year old who is simply trying to build a life , exercise his talents while figuring out what manhood and fame is all about as he carries the weight of supporting his family as well as providing the paychecks to others who depend on him to work so they can feed their families as well ? " she wrote			2
" does that render being called a c --- by an adult male photographer as you try to return to your hotel after leaving the ( sic ) hospital ? " sure , @entity1 has consciously snapped a few pictures of his bare abs , and strolled through the airport topless , but the singer has n't even been present for some of the events that produced the most scandalous and tragic headlines of all			1
in 2011 , a @entity58 woman alleged in a paternity lawsuit that @entity1 fathered her 3 - month - old baby boy			1
and in january , a photographer was killed by oncoming traffic after he thought he saw @entity1 sitting in his white @entity196 in @entity197			2
" while i was not present nor directly involved with this tragic accident , my thoughts and prayers are with the family of the victim , " @entity1 said in a statement			2
" there 's a lot of pressure on this kid to do bigger , better things , " @entity204 wrote on tulsaworld.com january			0
" the adoration could be crushing			0
@entity1 , so far , has mastered it by being himself			2
he threw up on stage once ; he 's raced cars ; he 's partied ... some			0
" maybe we should all take a page out of internet sensation and @entity220 ' advocate @entity219 's book and just leave @entity1 alone ?			1

@entity1 is one of many celebs who 've grown up under the proverbial microscope
" i think i 'll make a smooth transition from a teen star to an adult star , " he said in 2011
2013 is already shaping up to be that fateful transition time in @entity1 's career
