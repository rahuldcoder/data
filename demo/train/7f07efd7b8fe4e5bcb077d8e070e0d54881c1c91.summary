-- fifty years ago this weekend , a four - piece guitar band from @entity2 touched down at @entity3 in @entity4 and changed the course of popular culture in the twentieth century			0
that much we can be sure of , and since the days of @entity8 that guitar band has been credited with changing music , fashion , culture and everything else that really counted in the sixties			1
the trans - @entity16 entertainment industry is gearing up for an avalanche of tributes and events to commemorate this anniversary			0
the dyspeptic rock critic @entity21 once railed against the never - ending re-release of the @entity24 catalog by asking : " i 'd like to know what i have missed by not missing the @entity24			2
" the answer over the next few weeks is plenty : concerts , exhibits , panel discussions , documentaries , conferences and a pre-recorded @entity34 tribute featuring a " reunion " of @entity36 and @entity37			0
for that generation lucky enough to be swept along by @entity8 , it was a unique event , a turning point for some			2
there are still plenty of @entity44 of a certain age who can tell you exactly what happened when they first saw the @entity24 on the @entity50 that chilly february night : " i was two inches from the screen , screaming			2
" the run - up to this anniversary feels a little like the preparations for the @entity24 arrival in 1964 , when there was a continual stream of tidbits , teasers and promotions which announced " @entity24 are coming ! " but instead of radio bulletins , high - school gossip , and those flyers that @entity66 records distributed to record stores nationwide , this time the news comes to us on mobile phones and lap tops , in web casts and posts on the internet			1
if you miss the rebroadcast of the @entity76 show this weekend you can easily retrieve it from numerous sites on the world wide web , but back in 1964 you had to wait a whole week for the next @entity50			1
this of course added to the tension and increased the expectation of another television event which could not be missed			0
if a note of self - congratulation enters into the celebrations , you can hardly blame the record and television companies for waxing nostalgic for a time when @entity44 were locked into watching three channels and still buying records			2
in the fractured and endlessly expanding digital world , nobody will be able to recreate the excitement of @entity8 because it is no longer possible to completely command the media as the @entity24 did back in 1964			1
the triumph of @entity8 was essentially a triumph of the record -- the seven inch vinyl disc -- and a demonstration of its potency in diffusing culture and creating value			2
@entity8 's anniversary might be the time to mark an end of that era , when records were something you treasured			1
in the digital world sound recordings are cheap and disposable ; you wo n't be able to relive the giddy excitement of returning home with that priceless copy of " @entity120 " with an mp3 download			1
the anniversary of @entity8 will doubtless see more praise heaped on the musicians and their timeless music			1
but who were the architects of @entity8 ? @entity127 planned the campaign , perfected the look and made the deals ( some strokes of genius , others not )			2
above all he saw the @entity44 market as the pinnacle of success : " we knew that @entity44 would make us or break us as world stars ... in fact , she made us			0
" how ironic that what began as an exercise in @entity44 exceptionalism ended in a " @entity144 " of imported music , fashion and design that swept all before it and made the sixties look and sound like the sixties			0
@entity8 marked the ascendancy of @entity152 - based television producers who created a new type of music program -- live , frenetic , engaging -- and made the @entity24 its most able practitioners			1
@entity8 was powered by radio : not crystal - clear broadcasts from corporate headquarters but crackling , crummy am , with crazed disc jockeys like @entity162 providing a running commentary of @entity8 and whipping the fans into a frenzy			0
those tiny transistor radios that the girls carried with them connected them to a larger community of @entity24 lovers , a radio family who dressed alike , thought alike and shared the same obsession			0
fifty years on that community sees @entity8 as a special moment in time			1
there was an air of expectation in the crowd awaiting the @entity24 at @entity3 : " at the airport you could really feel that something was happening ... you felt like this was the beginning of the earthquake			0
the @entity24 touched teenagers like no other band before or after , lifting their fans ' gaze above the buying and selling of a commodity to an aura of hope and a state of transcendence			0
in 1964 music could change your life			0

*historian* @entity205 says nobody will be able to recreate the excitement of @entity8
the fractured digital world makes it *impossible* to completely command the media as the @entity24 did back in 1964
