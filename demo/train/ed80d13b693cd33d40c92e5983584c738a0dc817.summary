-- last year , on my third trip to the @entity3 , i met @entity4 , a shy , soft - spoken boy who appeared to be far younger than the 13 years he said he was			1
he told me he had lived in a nearby village			1
he and his family had been asleep around dawn when strange men burst into their house			1
with machetes , they killed his father and brother			2
as @entity4 ran for his life with his 10 - year old brother , @entity15 , the men struck a final machete blow on the head of the younger child			2
the boys hid in the bush for weeks			2
somehow little @entity15 survived , and the two found their way to an abandoned schoolroom in the troubled town of @entity25			2
people of all ages filled the space -- sitting , sleeping , waiting			1
everyone had a similar story : they had seen family members killed , their houses had been set on fire , they had run for their lives , they were surrounded by their attackers , they were not safe			2
no one dared to guess what would happen to them			2
they were living from day to day			2
they were scared and they were hungry			0
since that november visit , the @entity3 has spiraled into deeper chaos and violence -- an unimaginable violence in which children are directly targeted , raped , tortured , mutilated and killed			1
in 2007 and 2008 , i came away from my visits to this remote nation thinking that the women and children of the @entity3 are surely the most abandoned people on @entity53			1
marauders and armed militia throughout the country were terrorizing communities			0
uncounted thousands of men , women and children were hiding in the forest eating leaves and sucking swamp water			0
for them , there were no medicines , no schools , no protection from the ever present violence			0
by the time of my visit in late 2013 , things had changed -- for the worse			0
the violence had taken a more sinister shape along sectarian and ethnic lines , turning communities against each other			0
as in all conflicts , the most vulnerable , the children , pay the heaviest price			0
according to the @entity81 , some of the 690,000 people have been displaced within their homeland while others have escaped into neighboring countries , where they are refugees			1
within @entity3 , every system has crumbled			1
malnutrition and disease stalk children this is a country where impunity reigns			0
the complete absence of law and order has given even @entity94 and his @entity95 a haven			0
it could easily be viewed as an open invitation for other extremist groups to set up training camps , including the likes of @entity103 's @entity102			1
yet in the midst of this grim scenario , there are unsung heroes : doctors and health workers are risking their lives to save the wounded and the sick			0
religious leaders , both @entity113 and @entity114 , are sheltering displaced families regardless of ethnicity or religious preference			1
organizations such as @entity119 and @entity120 are also on the ground			1
@entity120 is working with local partners to provide lifesaving support to hundreds of thousands of children			1
but humanitarian needs have outpaced funding			1
this year , @entity120 appealed for $ 81 million to help the most vulnerable children in the @entity3			1
at this point , not even half of that amount has been donated			0
in the face of the enormity of this tragedy , and the many other conflicts around the world , it is understandable that we would feel helpless			0
however , we should be inspired by the heroism and determination of those frontline humanitarian workers -- and by @entity4 with his little brother and all the innocents who are hungry , hurting and living in terror but who hope for better times			0
for them , i think we can do better .			0

@entity149 is a @entity120 *goodwill* *ambassador* ; she *focuses* on kids *devastated* by *war*
she got the @entity153 for her work in the @entity3
nearly *700,000* people have been displaced by *fighting* there
@entity120 is working on the ground , but it 's running short on funding
