@entity0 -- two years ago , @entity2 -- the famed and much - feared head of the @entity0 mob -- was sitting pretty in @entity4 , @entity5			1
today , he 's sitting in prison , where he could potentially spend the rest of the life			1
the turn of events was capped monday when a federal jury found the former mob boss guilty on 31 of 32 counts -- including extortion , money laundering , drug dealing and weapons possession			1
the jury held @entity2 responsible for the murder of 11 people			1
the 83 - year - old @entity2 faces a maximum sentence of up to life , plus 30 years in prison			1
" so many peoples ' lives were so terribly harmed by the criminal actions of @entity2 and his crew			2
and today 's conviction does not alter that harm , and it does n't lessen it , " said @entity29 attorney @entity28 , speaking about the victims and their families			0
" however , we hope that they find some degree of comfort in the fact that today has come , and @entity2 is being held accountable for his horrific crimes , " she said			2
@entity2 was accused of involvement in killing 19 people , including two women			1
@entity2 linked to 11 murders the jury found @entity2 played a role in 11 of those murders , and that the evidence did not prove he was involved in seven , stretching back to 1973			1
the jury made no finding in one murder			2
@entity51 , widow of victim @entity53 , cried openly when the verdict was announced			0
victim @entity56 ' daughter , @entity55 , clenched her fists and said , " yes " when her father 's death by @entity2 was proved			1
but the daughter of victim @entity61 left court after the jury did not find enough evidence to link @entity2 to his death			1
" thirty - eight years ago when my father died , we always knew who killed him			0
we still know who killed him , and we still cant get any justice , " said @entity69 , now grown			0
and victim @entity74 ' brother , @entity73 , left in disbelief after the jury had " no finding " in her death			0
@entity74 was dating @entity2 partner @entity79 , and one day in 1981 just did n't come home			2
" it 's hard to digest			0
with all the years since ' 81 , i 've been looking for answers , searching for answers , and i come out with an @entity84			0
it 's not good enough , " @entity73 told @entity1			0
" i put up a big fight for justice , for answers			0
i do n't believe in closure , but i believe that i deserve more than an @entity84			0
i 'm disappointed , " he said			0
their lives had one thing in common : @entity2 16 years on the lam the eight men and four women of the jury deliberated for five days , over more than 32 hours , before reaching their verdict			1
the only count @entity2 was not found guilty of was on the alleged extortion of @entity102 , a ticket broker , who had said he was warned in 1994 that he had to give " payoffs " to @entity2 in order to operate			1
@entity2 showed no emotion as the verdicts were read			2
they came after seven weeks of testimony about murder , extortion , drug trafficking , loansharking , bookmaking and other gangster crimes covering the time @entity2 ran @entity0 's @entity117 mob from the early ' 70s through late 1994 , when he fled the city			1
share your thoughts on the verdict the case closes an epic criminal tale that included a life on the lam for 16 years that began when a crooked @entity128 agent told @entity2 that he was about to be indicted on federal racketeering charges			1
the gangster who ruled south @entity0 soon became one of the most wanted men in @entity29			2
@entity2 the @entity128 informant became @entity2 the @entity128 fugitive			2
it was the stuff of @entity137 moviemaking , and in fact , @entity2 's mob - boss brutality inspired @entity141 's character in the film " @entity146 , " which was directed by @entity143 and won four @entity144 in 2006 , including best picture			1
then , in 2011 , the @entity128 finally tracked him down : @entity2 was living on the other side of the country in an apartment just blocks from the beaches of @entity4			1
he had about $ 822,000 in cash -- largely $ 100 bills -- hidden inside a wall in his apartment , located in a tourist haven right beside @entity156			0
@entity2 also kept 30 guns in his residence			2
daring to the end , @entity2 was hiding in plain sight , living under an alias with his girlfriend			2
they called themselves @entity165 and @entity166			0
@entity2 ' pleased ' by the verdict it was a long fall for @entity2 : one of @entity29 's notorious mob bosses was called " a rat bastard " and " a coward " by victims ' relatives and former associates who attended or watched the trial			1
@entity2 declined to take the stand to testify in his defense , telling the judge , outside the jury 's presence , that his trial was " a sham " because he had an immunity deal with federal authorities in exchange for being an informant			1
the judge had ruled he could n't make that claim during his trial			0
however , after the verdict , @entity2 's lawyer said that his client was " very pleased " by both the trial and its outcome			2
" it was important to him that the government corruption be exposed , and important to him that people see first hand the deals that the government was able to make with certain people , " attorney @entity194 told reporters			0
