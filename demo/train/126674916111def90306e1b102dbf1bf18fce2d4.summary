@entity0 , @entity1 -- we all know that vaccines save lives by protecting people against disease			2
what is less well - known is that vaccines also are an engine for economic growth -- far beyond their health benefits			2
i am reminded of this in @entity1 this week , where my organization , the @entity14 , is hosting a conference for its partners			1
@entity14 's mission is to save children 's lives and protect people 's health by increasing access to immunization in developing countries			1
we do n't do this alone			0
we have many partners , including prominent companies that work closely with @entity14			1
they recognize that in addition to the humanitarian need , countries such as @entity1 are emerging markets that can fulfill their economic ambitions only if they also can ensure good health for their citizens			0
the private sector is a critical part of the equation			1
our corporate partners know they can do well by doing good			0
it has an ambitious five - year development plan that aims to transform the country into a middle - income economy by 2025			1
the plan includes critical funding to ensure a healthy population by strengthening the health system , which will significantly improve child and maternal mortality rates			0
@entity1 already has begun this process by working closely with @entity14 and its partners to significantly increase its routine vaccine coverage rates to above 90 % today from 79 % in 2001 , the year before @entity14 began its work there , according to data from the @entity55 and @entity56			2
at the same time , @entity1 's gdp growth has been astounding , rising to $ 23.7 billion last year from $ 10.2 billion in 2001 , according to the @entity58			0

but we know for a fact that vaccines -- in addition to saving lives and improving health -- are the cornerstone of a vibrant economy , fuel growth and serve as a magnet for foreign investment			1
indeed , research has shown vaccines to be among the most cost - effective investments in global development			0
this has been borne out of several independent studies that look beyond the health impacts toward areas such as cognitive development , educational attainment , labor productivity and financial attainment			0
in other words , healthier children -- spurred by immunization -- attend school more often , learn more while they are there and remain in school longer			1
as adults , they therefore are more productive , earn more money , save and invest more , and live longer			2
healthier children also spread less disease through the adult population , further increasing productivity			1

for instance , i attended a landmark meeting in @entity115 in july organized by the @entity116 , where its president @entity117 brought together a variety of ministers and experts to discuss how to allocate budgets and make healthcare a national priority			0
i was in @entity115 because of the wide recognition that immunization can be the high - octane fuel that leads to increased trade , capital infrastructure projects and technological improvement			0
this brings me back to the private sector and the benefits many companies now see in playing a role in supporting global health , including immunization services			1
one benefit , of course , is humanitarian			0
the @entity14 -- with help from partners such as @entity56 , @entity55 , the @entity141 , the @entity58 and donors -- has helped countries immunize 370 million people , saving more than 5.5 million lives since 2000			1
@entity14 now is in the midst of helping immunize another quarter billion people , which could save an additional 4 million lives by 2015			2
the private sector is involved , providing core business skills to tackle key obstacles to immunization in the developing world			1
for example , @entity14 is working with a leading telecommunications company to explore the use of its mobile technology with hopes of improving vaccine stock management in implementing countries and alerting parents when children are due for vaccines			1
@entity14 is constantly looking for partners to lend their business savvy to help us accomplish our mission			1
an increasing number of them are responding , compassionate in their outlook while aware of the underlying economic value of vaccines			0
they understand that this is the highest return on investment they could ever make			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			2
