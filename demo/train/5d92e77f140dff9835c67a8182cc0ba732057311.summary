-- @entity2 rugby coach @entity1 has been banned from coaching for three years for his part in masterminding a fake blood injury to one of his players			1
@entity2 rugby coach @entity1 admitted asking his player to fake an injury using artificial blood			1
in a scandal dubbed " bloodgate " the 46 - year - old admitted to getting one of his players to use fake blood to feign injury in order to make an otherwise impossible substitution happen at a crucial time in a @entity21 quarterfinal between his side harlequins and @entity24			1
sport is littered with competitive personalities , but some are prepared to go further than others in order to achieve victory			1
do you agree with @entity0 's list of sport 's top ten notorious rulebreakers ? 1			1
@entity35 , football - for years @entity35 shared the credit for his most remembered goal with a higher being			2
" a little with the head of @entity35 and a little with the hand of @entity48 " was his account of how he scored the opener in @entity42 's 2 - 1 victory over @entity43 during the 1986 @entity45 semi-final			1
however , in 2005 @entity35 admitted that it was less divine intervention than retribution that was behind the now infamous goal			2
referring to the @entity54 control of the @entity55 which lie just off @entity42 and were the scene of a bitter war in 1982 , he said : " i do n't for a second regret scoring that goal with my hand			2
. whoever robs a thief gets a 100 - year pardon			2
@entity69 , the marathon - after taking gold - medal in the 1980 @entity66 and setting the third - fastest time ever recorded for a female runner in the process , many spectators noticed how remarkably sweat - free and relaxed the 23 - year old @entity69 appeared as she took to the winner 's podium			1
race officials were also dismayed by the jubilant victor 's absence from the numerous photographs taken during the competition , and none of the checkpoint monitors or fellow runners were able to recognize the young champion after the 26 - mile race had ended			1
it was not long before a few members of the crowd came forward to reveal that they had seen @entity69 simply jump in during the last half - mile , where she duly sprinted to the finish line			2
@entity88 , boxing - in the early 1980s " @entity90 " was regarded as one of the most formidable boxing trainers of his time			2
these days he is typically regarded as one of the sports murkiest operatives			1
@entity90 's lowly stature was secured during the 1983 fight between his boxer @entity99 and @entity101 before the fight @entity90 had soaked @entity99 's hands in plaster of @entity105 and removed the padding from his gloves			1
@entity99 punched @entity108 to a pulp and , nine months later , @entity108 - suffering from depression caused by the fight - died in a car accident that many believe was suicide			2
@entity35 scores against @entity43 for @entity42 using what he called the " hand of god			2
@entity118 's 2000 @entity117 team , basketball - the @entity120 witnessed the basketball team from @entity118 take the gold medal in the " intellectual disability " category			1
however , soon after @entity124 , an undercover journalist , revealed that the players on @entity118 's team had not actually undergone the testing required to prove mental deficiency			1
it turned out that ten of the twelve players on the @entity118 basketball team had no such disability			0
the @entity134 subsequently decided to scrap the category due to the difficulties of assessing the disabilities of performers			0
@entity141 , cycling - in 1978 the @entity140 rider was ahead of the rest of the field after the mountain stage of the @entity145			0
he submitted a urine sample which came back clean from drugs , the only problem was it was n't his urine ! it transpired that @entity141 had used a sample given to him by his teammate that was delivered via a plastic pipe concealed in his shorts , he was subsequently thrown from the @entity145			0
@entity157 , athletics - the @entity54 sprinter had high hopes of taking on the world 's elite after showing early potential but his career was derailed when he tested positive for the banned substance @entity164 in 2003			1
slapped with a two - year suspension and lifetime ban from the @entity168 ( @entity168 ) @entity165 later revealed he was taking a cocktail of seven different drugs			0
@entity171 , fencing - as a fencer for the @entity173 , @entity171 performed unbelievably for his nation 's modern pentathlon team at the @entity176			1
and there was good reason as the @entity54 team , who complained to the organizers , suspected			0
it turns out the wily athlete used an illegal switch to trigger the system that registered a hit from his foil on his opponents , which guaranteed him victory			0
the illegal switch on his grip was discovered resulting in his disqualification from the @entity193			0
the @entity54 sprinter @entity157 admitted to taking a cocktail of seven different drugs while competing			0
@entity198 , high jump - in the 1936 olympic games in @entity201 , @entity197 was determined to prove his philosophy about the aryan race -- that meant winning at any cost			0
@entity198 , who was known for her low voice and reluctance to share the shower room with the other female athletes , was the @entity210 entry for the women 's high jump			1
after setting a new world record , @entity54 's @entity214 , the former holder , suggested to officials that @entity198 was a man			1
after some research @entity198 was found serving as a waiter called @entity219			0
@entity198 , born @entity198 , had in fact been a member of the @entity221 and said that the @entity222 had made him participate as a woman			0
@entity224 , the marathon - in the burning heat of the @entity227 in @entity228 , only 14 of the 32 starting marathon runners made the finish line			0
all the more credit then to @entity224 , the @entity232 who burst through the white tape after three hours and 13 minutes , to be announced the winner			0
having bagged a photograph with the @entity237 , daughter of the @entity238 , @entity224 was on his way to collect an apparently well - deserved gold medal			0
however , word soon spread that the @entity242 had spent nearly half the marathon sitting down ... in a car			0
despite claiming it was just a practical joke , @entity224 received a lifetime ban			0
@entity253 , 100 meters - having taken gold medal at the @entity250 and slicing four - hundredths of a second off the world record , @entity248 's 100m sprint champion took to the mic : " i 'd like to say my name is @entity256 and this world record will last 50 years , maybe 100			1
" only hours after the race had ended , a urine sample belonging to the sprinter was found to contain the anabolic steroid stanozolal resulting in the time being scrapped from the record books			0
@entity253 protested his innocence but , after a two - year suspension , he was banned in 1993 for testing positive again - and this time it was for life .			2
