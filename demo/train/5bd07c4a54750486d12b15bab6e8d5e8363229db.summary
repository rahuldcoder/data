@entity0 -- health care reform backers won a key victory saturday night as the @entity4 voted to move ahead with a floor debate on a sweeping $ 848 billion bill			2
the 60 - 39 vote to prevent a @entity9 filibuster against the start of debate on senate majority leader @entity13 's legislation broke down along strict party lines			1
all 58 @entity15 -- along with independent sens. @entity16 of @entity17 and @entity18 of @entity19 -- supported bringing the measure to the floor			1
thirty - nine of the 40 @entity23 opposed the motion			2
sen. @entity25 , @entity26 , did n't vote			1
" tonight 's historic vote brings us one step closer to ending insurance company abuses , reining in spiraling health care costs , providing stability and security to those with health insurance and extending quality health coverage to those who lack it , " @entity28 press secretary @entity27 said in a statement			1
the polarized vote set the table for a holiday season now virtually certain to be marked by acrimonious deliberations on president @entity46 's top domestic priority			1
@entity47 , who are trying to pass a bill before the end of the year , spent much of the day tarring their @entity9 colleagues as defenders of a broken status quo benefitting rich insurance companies at the expense of ordinary @entity57 families			1
republicans , in turn , slammed democrats for pushing a bill that conservatives insist will force millions of @entity57 to drop insurance plans they like while boosting premiums , raising taxes and leading to government rationing of care			1
read the health care bill ( @entity69 ) " today we [ decide ] whether to even discuss one of the greatest issues of our generation , " @entity13 , a @entity71 @entity70 , said shortly before the vote			1
" whether this nation will finally guarantee its people the right to live free from fear of illness and death , which can be prevented by decent health care for all			2
" the @entity23 " are frightening people , " said sen. @entity85 , @entity86			2
" now is not the time to go wobbly in the knees			2
now is the time to stand strong ... and move this country forward			2
" " this bill ... is a massive monument to bureaucracy and spending , " replied senate minority leader @entity91 , @entity92			1
it " imposes punishing taxes on almost everyone			2
... a vote in favor of proceeding to this bill is a vote in favor of adding to the tax burden of the @entity57 people in the midst of double digit unemployment			1
" the bill " does worse than nothing , " said sen. @entity108 , @entity109			0
it " threatens the economic recovery			0
... changes to the health care system must be responsible and not break the backs of the taxpayers			0
" the procedural vote represented another milestone in what has become an epic battle over the future of @entity57 's health care system			1
the @entity124 narrowly passed a more than $ 1 trillion bill this month			0
if the @entity4 also manages to pass a bill , a congressional conference committee will then need to merge the @entity28 and @entity4 proposals into a consensus version requiring final approval from each chamber before moving to @entity46 's desk to be signed into law			1
the nonpartisan @entity134 has projected that @entity13 's 2,074 - page bill would extend health insurance coverage to 31 million additional @entity57			1
the agency estimates that the proposal would reduce the federal deficit by $ 130 billion over the next 10 years , through 2019			0
any effect on the deficit in the following decade would be " subject to substantial uncertainty , " but probably would result in " small reductions in federal budget deficits , " according to budget office analysts			0
a minimum of 60 votes is required to break a filibuster in the 100 - member @entity4			0
the outcome of the @entity4 vote was unclear before saturday afternoon , when sen. @entity152 , @entity153 , announced her intention to back a floor debate on the measure			1
@entity157 , a key moderate probably facing a tough re-election campaign in 2010 , said the issue deserved further debate and consideration			0
she made clear , however , that she opposes several aspects of @entity13 's bill , including a controversial government - run public option			1
" although i do n't agree with everything in this bill , i believe it is important to begin debate , " @entity157 said			0
" the issue is very complex			0
there is no easy fix			0
" republicans wasted no time tearing into @entity157 's vote , issuing a news release while she was still announcing her decision , proclaiming that she had caved to " pressure from the left wing of her party			1
" " there 's no doubt that this vote will be a critical issue for sen. @entity157 as she embarks on her uphill re-election bid , " said @entity184 , a @entity9 spokeswoman			1
" the people of @entity153 will have an opportunity to hold her accountable when they cast their ballots next november			0
" two other @entity196 moderates whose support was considered to be in doubt -- @entity200 's @entity199 and @entity202 's @entity201 -- also announced their decision to back a full debate shortly before the vote			1
@entity13 's bill , projected to ensure coverage for 94 percent of @entity57 , includes a range of tax increases and new fees			2
the @entity212 payroll tax on individuals earning $ 200,000 a year and couples earning $ 250,000 a year would increase by half a percentage point , from the current 1.45 percent to 1.95 percent			0
in addition , insurers providing costly health coverage -- known as @entity219 plans -- would face a 40 percent tax on policies worth more than $ 8,500 for individuals and $ 23,000 for families			0
the bill also includes a 5 percent tax on the cost of elective cosmetic surgery , as well as new fees for insurers and pharmaceutical manufacturers			0
the total projected revenue raised by all the taxes and fees would exceed $ 200 billion			0
the bill would require individuals to buy health insurance , with a fine for non-compliance of $ 95 in the first year that would escalate to $ 750 by 2016			0
unlike the plan recently passed by the @entity28 , the @entity4 bill does not mandate that all employers offer health care			1
businesses with more than 50 workers , where at least one employee qualifies for government subsidies , would face a penalty of $ 750 for every full - time employee if it does not offer health care coverage			0
@entity13 's bill also would expand government - run @entity253 coverage for the poor to everyone making less than 133 percent of the national poverty level			2
@entity196 leaders in both chambers have been wrestling with the most contentious issues , including abortion and immigration , as well as how to pay for reform			0
the @entity28 bill has more restrictive abortion language and includes a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge on individuals making more than $ 500,000 and couples earning more than $ 1 million			1
both bills include a government - run public option , but the @entity4 version allows states to opt out before the national program would go into effect in 2014			0
the two bills are virtually identical on a broad range of changes , including creating health insurance exchanges , expanding @entity253 , subsidizing insurance for low - and some middle - income families , and capping out - of - pocket medical expenses while preventing insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions			0
insurers under both plans would be barred from charging higher premiums based on a person 's gender or medical history .			2
