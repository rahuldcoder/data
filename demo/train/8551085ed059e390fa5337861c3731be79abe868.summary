-- " thank you , mr. president , you 're not such a bad - looking guy yourself			1
" that would have been my response if i were @entity8 attorney general @entity7 , who finds herself in the middle of a media dustup after president @entity11 introduced her as : " by far the best - looking attorney general in the country , " at a fundraiser earlier this week			1
@entity15 is a beautiful woman			2
she 's also super intelligent and accomplished , which the president also noted			1
in fact , he lauded her professional merits first			2
so , i say take the compliment and move on			1
or , if you 're slightly embarrassed by the comment , give it back and move on			1
president @entity11 's observation is not a major offense to women around the globe			1
ridiculous flaps such as this one have always made me uncomfortable with calling myself a feminist , especially if that means i have to fly into a fit each time a man makes an awkward comment about a woman			2
these were the president 's exact words , according to a @entity40 transcript from the fundraiser : " you have to be careful to , first of all , say she is brilliant and she is dedicated and she is tough , and she is exactly what you 'd want in anybody who is administering the law , and making sure that everybody is getting a fair shake			1
she also happens to be by far the best - looking attorney general in the country â € ” @entity7 is here			2
) and she is a great friend and has just been a great supporter for many , many years			2
" opinion : @entity11 's ' best - looking ' remark was sexist clearly , the president realized in hindsight that his comment did n't go over very well , and he has apologized			1
but i do n't believe an apology was necessary			0
it 's impossible to believe that anyone could seriously call president @entity11 a chauvinist over this banter between friends			1
no matter your politics , you will have a hard time finding a president who has included women more in his agenda			1
what has he done for us lately ? let me recall just a few things : - appointed two female @entity79 justices , @entity80 and @entity81			0
- appointed @entity82 as secretary of state			0
- signed the @entity84 , which restored worker protections against pay discrimination			0
the bill had failed in the @entity88 in 2007			0
i have disagreed with the president at times , but if @entity92 is sexist , then we need more men just like him ; the world would be a much better place for women			1
in my book , when a person -- man or woman -- acknowledges someone 's intellect and professionalism and then gives a lighthearted nod to her beauty , it 's not sexist			1
it 's just a compliment			1
throughout my career , i 've had to learn how to deal with men , and a few women , who made it a point to always comment on my looks , or tell jokes about women working in sports			1
early in my career , i admit , i was uncomfortable and wondered how to best handle the situation , not easy when you are many times the only woman in the newsroom			0
but even when i started out , i realized that context is everything , especially in the workplace , when talking about women and harassment			1
here 's an example : one night , while i was working late in the office editing on deadline , a male co-worker stumbled into my cubicle in a drunken stupor , he slung himself on my desk and leaned into me , slurring : " @entity133 , you 're so beautiful			2
seriously , i 've been watching you			0
... why do n't you pay attention to me ? " now , that was creepy			0
and clearly it was sexual harassment			0
my bosses and the human resources department quickly dealt with the guy			0
in fact , his behavior was reported by a male colleague , who witnessed the entire thing , before i could even make the call			0
on another occasion , a senior executive speaking at an employee " town hall " meeting at work , pointed me out for a professional accomplishment , and then added : " hey , @entity133 looks like that woman on the show , ' the @entity155			0
' " there was some laughter in the room but most of the women froze			2
i laughed and said : " thanks , i 'm glad you like my new hairdo			0
" sure , i knew immediately that the comment was a little awkward			2
but i was in no way offended			0
and i did not want the executive , who had always been a champion for women in the workplace , to get any backlash for his comment			1
he did n't deserve the criticism			0
honestly , when he made that comment i was more worried that my female colleagues would be angry with me			2
women might not want to admit this but we often hate women who look good , are smart and successful			1
just think : @entity177 , @entity178 , or @entity179 , @entity181 ceo			0
maybe we 've been conditioned to believe the stereotypes			0
but none of us will achieve true equality in the workplace until we end this animus toward one another and focus on how to truly achieve power			0
luckily , sometimes life is n't serious			0
sometimes , we can laugh at ourselves and know that not every man is out to hold us down			0
and if we women are indeed confident in our abilities and our appearance -- no matter how we look on the outside -- then we should stop cowering every time a man notices us and makes a comment			1
stand up strong and take the compliment , but just make sure you 're handling your business , because beauty is nothing without brains to match			2
