@entity0 -- the rev. @entity2 criticized @entity4 presidential candidate @entity3 on tuesday over his reaction to the arrest of six black juveniles in @entity8 , @entity9 , on murder charges , accusing the @entity12 senator of " acting like he 's white , " according to a @entity15 newspaper			1
the rev. @entity2 speaks to the press tuesday in @entity8 , @entity9			1
the comments reportedly came during a speech at @entity19 , a historically black college in @entity20 , @entity15			0
the newspaper reports @entity2 later said he did not recall saying @entity3 is " acting like he 's white , " but continued to condemn the @entity12 @entity23 as well as the other presidential candidates for not bringing more attention to this issue			1
he also said @entity3 needs to be " bolder " in his stances if he wants to make inroads in @entity15			1
@entity3 currently trails rival sen. @entity30 in @entity15 by 18 points , according to a recent @entity34 / @entity33 poll			2
in a statement released wednesday afternoon , @entity3 said his previous statments about the @entity8 case " were carefully thought out " with input from his national campaign chairman and @entity2 's son , rep. @entity41 , @entity42			1
" outrage over an injustice like the @entity8 is n't a matter of black and white			1
it 's a matter of right and wrong , " he said in the statement			2
@entity2 , who ran for president twice in the 1980s , endorsed @entity3 's @entity48 bid earlier in the year			1
@entity2 won the @entity15 @entity4 primary , where @entity51 voters play an influential role , in both presidential bids			2
" if i were a candidate , i 'd be all over @entity8 , " the prominent civil rights activist said tuesday in @entity20 , @entity15 , the @entity56 newspaper reports			1
" @entity8 is a defining moment , just like @entity58 was a defining moment			2
" in a statement released wednesday , @entity2 reaffirmed his support for @entity3			1
" he has remarkably transcended race , however the impact of @entity64 and @entity8 makes @entity66 's unresolved moral dilemma of race unavoidable , " he said			1
" i think @entity68 is another defining moment of the issue of race and the criminal justice system			2
this issue requires direct and bold leadership			0
i commend sen. @entity3 for speaking out and demanding fairness on this defining issue			1
any attempt to dilute my support for sen. @entity3 will not succeed			2
" tensions had simmered at @entity79 and in the small town for first three months of the 2006 school year after a black student asked the vice principal if he and some friends could sit under an oak tree where white students typically congregated			0
told by the vice principal they could sit wherever they pleased , the student and his pals sat under the sprawling branches of the shade tree in the campus courtyard			0
the next day , students arrived at school to find three nooses hanging from those branches			0
according to @entity100 in nearby @entity101 , the school 's principal recommended expulsion for those involved in placing the nooses			0
instead , the newspaper reported , a school district committee suspended three white students for three days calling the incident just a " prank			2
" on december 4 , several students jumped a white classmate , @entity8 , knocking him unconscious while stomping and kicking him			1
the charges against the six blacks -- dubbed the " @entity8 " -- resulted from that incident			1
@entity2 is slated to be on hand for a march in @entity8 this thursday			1
the rev. @entity116 , @entity117 , and hip - hop artist @entity118 are also expected to be on hand			0
@entity3 formally released a statement on the case friday evening after one of the teen 's charges was thrown out , saying , " i am pleased that the @entity9 state appeals court recognized that the aggravated battery charge brought in this case was inappropriate			1
" " i hope that today 's decision will lead the prosecutor to reconsider the excessive charges brought against all the teenagers in this case , " he added			1
" and i hope that the judicial process will move deliberately to ensure that all of the defendants will receive a fair trial and equal justice under the law			0
" he also said in a separate statement last week , " when nooses are being hung in high schools in the 21st century , it 's a tragedy			0
it shows that we still have a lot of work to do as a nation to heal our racial tensions			0
this is n't just @entity68 's problem ; it 's @entity66 's problem			0
" @entity1 senior political analyst @entity152 said @entity3 is under special pressure because he is the only @entity51 - @entity51 running for president			2
but @entity3 is not of the same generation of black leaders , such as @entity2 , who came out of the civil rights moment , @entity152 said			1
" i think that gives him a special position , " @entity152 said			0
" he is running on his appeal -- to white voters as well as to @entity51 voters -- as a uniter			0
" " he does n't want to be a divider in this case , " @entity152 said			0
meanwhile , @entity3 's chief rivals for the @entity4 nomination , @entity170 and former @entity172 sen. @entity171 , have also recently condemned the @entity8 case			1
sen. @entity170 said the controversy surrounding the " @entity8 " court case is a " teachable moment for @entity66			1
" " people need to understand that we can not let this kind of inequality and injustice happen anywhere in @entity66 , " the @entity4 presidential hopeful told the rev. @entity116 when she called into his nationally syndicated radio program tuesday afternoon			0
at last saturday 's @entity185 in @entity186 , @entity170 said , " there is no excuse for the way the legal system treated those young people			0
... this case reminds us that the scales of justice are seriously out of balance when it comes to charging , sentencing , and punishing african - americans			0
" " it cries out for a full investigation from the @entity203 's @entity202			0
" @entity171 released a statement wednesday morning , saying " as someone who grew up in the segregated @entity15 , i feel a special responsibility to speak out on racial intolerance			0
americans of all races are traveling to @entity8 because they believe that how we respond to the racial tensions in @entity8 says everything about who we are as a nation			2
