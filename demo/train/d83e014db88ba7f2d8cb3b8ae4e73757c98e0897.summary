@entity0 -- pirates ? ravers ? at first glance , the portraits are startling and confusing			1
hidden behind sunglasses and hats , their faces shrouded in brightly colored scarves and t - shirts , these striking , enigmatic figures could as easily be rebel fighters as models at an edgy runway show			2
in fact , they are migrant construction workers of the @entity17 , mostly men from @entity19 and @entity20 whose cheap labor has powered the rise of the country 's skyscrapers			1
the laborers -- often subjected to exploitative working conditions , according to @entity27 -- are described by photographer @entity28 as " the new slaves " of the @entity30			1
" but they do n't look like slaves , " said the @entity31 , whose photographic study of the migrant workers was published as a book , " @entity36 , " by @entity35 last month			1
they do n't look like like workers either , he said , their bright colors a stark contrast to traditionally drab depictions of laborers in the @entity45			2
" i try to give something very beautiful , a little seductive			2
i want not to denounce , but to give people the possibility to get inside a very deep problem , " @entity28 added			1
@entity28 began visiting the @entity17 in 2007 , initially training his camera on the bold new architecture emerging out of the desert			1
but he soon became fascinated with the brightly - dressed workers in the margins of his viewfinder , a group which seemed to pass unnoticed by the surrounding society			2
" the most shocking thing for me is the violence of the indifference , " he said			0
despite their vivid appearance , he likened them to ghosts			2
" they were omnipresent but at the same time invisible , as if the eye did not see them as worth attention , " he writes			2
the men were anonymous , their faces were shielded from the sun , while their work barely registered with the majority of the population , which spent the day sheltered from the elements inside air - conditioned buildings			0
@entity28 began visiting their building sites and dormitory camps unannounced , shooting " very fast and very sharp " to capture realistic representations of the men and their surroundings			1
on one occasion he was arrested			0
having seen the squalid conditions in their dormitories , which he likened to a prison , he became further intrigued to discover the men , who earn salaries of about $ 160 a month , seem to accept their plight			0
" the worker is a slave , but he feels lucky to have an opportunity to try to meet his destiny , " said @entity28			1
" his hell is bearable			0
" @entity94 , @entity95 researcher at @entity27 , said that some workers paid up to $ 4,000 to recruiters in pursuit of good wages and low living expenses , taking on significant debts just to get the jobs			1
" most are completely trapped by financial circumstances , " she said			0
they are let into the country as temporary workers , usually on three - year permits			0
tight immigration laws grant their employers extraordinary powers over their lives , with bosses keeping their passports and sponsoring their visas , meaning they can not easily change jobs if they find the conditions intolerable			0
" the climate of fear they live in means they ca n't strike or protest , " she said			0
the economies of the @entity17 , and the other @entity125 countries of @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 , are heavily dependent on foreign workers , with an estimated 15 million foreigners working in the @entity125 , according to the @entity133			1
" many workers do n't know what they 're getting into , " said @entity94			0
" they 're not getting contracts that reflect what the job actually is , and the contracts are n't in their own language			0
" while there had been some improvements for workers in recent years , with governments introducing wage protection schemes and mandatory health insurance to be paid by employers , exploitation was still widespread , she said			1
@entity28 , who has also produced work on @entity151 , is currently exhibiting in @entity0 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154			1
" i love the idea of the pictures coming back to the origin , " he said of the @entity154 show			0
but there was little chance of his subjects coming across portraits of themselves in a @entity154 gallery			2
" of course not , " he said .			0
