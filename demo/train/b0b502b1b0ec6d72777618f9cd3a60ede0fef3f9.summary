-- @entity1 has finally won the only grand slam tournament to elude him after beating @entity4 's @entity3 in straight sets to claim the @entity7 title at @entity7			1
@entity1 is the @entity7 champion at last after beating @entity3 in straight sets at @entity7			1
the @entity9 world number two had 13 grand slam successes to his name prior to the event , but none of them had been on the @entity16 red clay			1
however , that changed on sunday as the 27 - year - old cruised to a 6 - 1 7 - 6 6 - 4 victory over 23rd seed @entity3 , the man who had caused a sensation by dumping four - time winner @entity22 out of the tournament earlier in the week			1
the victory moves @entity1 onto 14 career grand slam titles , level with @entity28 @entity27 as the most successful grand slam player in men 's tennis history			1
he also moved into a select group made up only of @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 as men who have won all four of the grand slam events			1
" it was probably my greatest ever victory , i was under big pressure			0
but i did it and it 's phenomenal , " an emotional @entity1 told a packed crowd on @entity43 -- before breaking down in tears after being presented with the trophy by @entity46 , the @entity47 champion and last player to win all four slams			2
" i think that now and until the end of my career , i can really play with my mind at peace and no longer hear that i 've never won @entity7 , " he added			2
you say : is @entity1 the greatest tennis player in history ? @entity3 , who beat @entity22 and @entity59 en route to the final , told the crowd : " i had the two best weeks of my career			1
@entity1 is a really worthy winner			0
to me he is the best player in history so he really deserves to win here at the @entity65 as well			0
" the 27 - year - old @entity1 , playing in his 19th grand slam final , could not have wished for a better start under threatening skies , which produced drizzling rain for the majority of the match			1
the @entity9 dropped just one point on his serve in three games , but , in contrast , @entity3 's serve was far from convincing and he soon trailed 4 - 0			1
@entity3 got on the scoreboard in the fifth game but he had already been broken twice by then			0
in the seventh game , the @entity4 was facing two set points when a rasping @entity1 forehand flew past him			2
@entity3 saved the first with an unreturnable serve but on the second , @entity1 unleashed a whipped backhand for the set			2
the second set , which did not have a single break of serve , was overshadowed by an incident which saw @entity1 come face to face with a court invader at the start of the fourth game			0
how it happened : see the @entity7 final in photos Â» the man , wearing a top bearing the word ' @entity9 ' on its chest , came down from high up in the stands and vaulted the barriers to enter the court			2
he ran up to @entity1 and brandished in front of the player 's face what appeared to be a flag of @entity109 team @entity108			0
he then attempted to put a cap on the head of @entity1 , who retreated way behind the service line			0
@entity113 took their time coming onto the court to aid @entity1 but when they did , they managed to accost the invader , who by that time had frantically run across the court and leapt the net			0
@entity1 at first appeared shaken -- he lost the next game to love -- admittedly on @entity3 's serve , but calm was soon restored as the rain started to come down and the set went to a tie - break			1
@entity1 played it flawlessly , smashing down four aces from four serves to clinch it in style			0
he then grabbed the key break in the third set in the very first game			0
soderling by that time had got over his early - match jitters but he could not halt @entity1 's juggernaut of a serve			2
he only earned his first break point of the match in the fourth game of that set , but the @entity9 came up with a fine forehand passing shot to save			0
serving for the match , @entity1 went break point down again to add to the drama			0
@entity3 wasted that with a mis - hit and then netted a return into the net two points later to hand @entity1 the title .			1

@entity1 finally wins @entity7 title with victory over @entity3
the @entity9 world number two beats his @entity4 *opponent* 6 - 1 7 - 6 6 - 4 in @entity16
@entity1 had won 13 grand slam titles prior to event , but never the @entity7
the success takes him level with @entity27 on 14 career grand slam wins
