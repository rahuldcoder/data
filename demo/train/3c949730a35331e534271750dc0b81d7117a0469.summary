@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 stood by new controversial screening measures saturday , calling methods such as pat - downs and body scans necessary to assure airline safety			1
speaking at a @entity11 press conference in @entity0 , @entity1 , the president called the balance between protecting travelers ' rights and their security a " tough situation			2
" per the new rules , travelers may be subject to full - body scans at 400 such machines in 69 airports nationwide			1
those who voluntarily opt out -- as well as those who set off a scanning machine or a metal detector -- are subject to a pat - down			1
some travelers have likened the pat - downs to groping			1
the president said such methods are needed after what happened december 25 , 2009 , when @entity31 of @entity32 allegedly boarded a flight from @entity34 to @entity35 with a bomb hidden in his underwear			2
@entity31 reportedly failed to set off the bomb , which metal detectors did n't detect , though his attempt led to airport screening procedures that have caused a holiday travel uproar			0
" at this point , the @entity45 , in consultation with our counterterrorism experts , have indicated to me that the procedures that they 've been putting in place are the only ones right now that they consider to be effective against the kind of threat that we saw in the @entity54 bombing , " said @entity3			2
@entity45 officers can use " professional discretion " to determine whether individuals should be subject to further screening , according to a statement from the federal agency			2
critics have called the procedures invasive , with @entity64 president @entity63 saying the agency " is forcing travelers to consent to a virtual strip search or allow an unknown officer to literally place his or her hands in your pants			0
" the president , while noting that he did n't have personal experience with the new security measures , said he understands " people 's frustrations			1
he said he 's asked @entity45 for assurances that " what we 're doing is the only way to assure the @entity85 people 's safety			0
" he said that he has also told the federal agency 's administrators that they must consider whether there are " less intrusive " ways to obtain the same goals			0
" one of the most frustrating aspects of this fight against terrorism is that it has created a whole security apparatus around us that causes huge inconvenience for all of us , " he said			0
@entity3 said that transportation security officials have a tough task , facing " enormous pressure " to prevent a terrorist attack			1
in a public statement released saturday , @entity45 administrator @entity103 spelled out the new security measures and offered tips to those flying this @entity107 week			1
" as you travel this holiday season , i want to remind you that @entity45 's mission is to ensure the safety of you the traveling public and we are committed to doing so efficiently , courteously and professionally , " @entity103 said			0
in @entity1 , the president vowed he 'd try to find a way to make passengers feel more both comfortable and safe , whether it is through the current policies or with new ones			0
" every week i meet with my counterterrorism team and i 'm constantly asking them whether -- is what we 're doing absolutely necessary ? have we thought it through ? are there other ways of accomplishing it that meet the same objectives ? " he said .			0
