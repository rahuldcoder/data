-- voices across the political spectrum are debating how to prevent mass shootings such as the one in @entity4 , @entity5			0
familiar ideological lines are being redrawn			0
some want to renew the ban on assault weapons and expand waiting periods to buy a gun			2
others want to place armed guards in schools			0
and then there is the challenge of preventing guns from falling into the hands of the mentally ill. while the debate rages on , it 's worth thinking out of the box for a moment			1
what if we could design guns to be smarter and safer -- with hardware and software ? the right technology could neutralize the killing capability of an assault weapon , even in a madman 's hands			1
the root of the problem is that guns are " dumb			1
" pull the trigger and they discharge bullets mindlessly , regardless of who is doing the aiming or where they are aimed			0
guns should " know " not to fire in schools , churches , hospitals or malls			2
they should sense when they are being aimed at a child , or at a person when no other guns are nearby			2
hardware fixes alone -- such as a ban on extended clips -- may mitigate carnage in an assault , but they will not change the risk that an event happens at all if the person holding the gun wants to harm others			2
addressing that challenge with reliable precision requires a hardware and software solution			2
many complex products have been transformed by safety - enhancing technology			1
look at airplanes , which have layers of computer - controlled safety features to temper pilot error			1
cars , increasingly , have sophisticated controls to override drivers and avoid collisions			0
guns , too , can benefit from technological advances			0
opinion : take politics out of gun research after the @entity4 shooting , a number of @entity82 leaders signed the " @entity86 " petition for new gun laws			0
it is good to know how strongly they feel about tougher regulation			0
it would be even better if they would invest their know - how and wealth to create a new kind of gun control -- the software kind			1
how might this work ? start with locational " self - awareness			1
" guns should know where they are and if another gun is nearby			1
global positioning systems can meet most of the need , refining a gun 's location to the building level , even within buildings			1
control of the gun would remain in the hand of the person carrying it , but the ability to fire multiple shots in crowded areas or when no other guns are present would be limited by software that understands where the gun is being used			1
guns should also be designed to sense where they are being aimed			0
artificial vision and optical sensing technology can be adapted from military and medical communities			0
sensory data can be used by built - in software to disable firing if the gun is pointed at a child or someone holding a child			1
building software into guns need not affect gun owners ' desire to protect their homes			1
trigger control software could be relaxed when the gun is at home or in a car , while other safety features stay on to prevent accidental discharges			1
guns used by the police would be exempt from such controls			0
finally , guns should be designed to broadcast their location when they are loaded			0
police could see if high - powered assault weapons are entering or getting close to a public place			0
gun owners , too , could choose to broadcast their guns ' locations publicly to increase deterrent effect			2
could n't gun software be hacked ? perhaps , but the risk can be reduced by open - sourcing code , requiring software patch downloads , and notifying gun makers or law enforcement if software is disabled			1
open - sourcing code is not foolproof , but it will build a community of lawful gun owners and code writers who value safety and @entity168 rights			2
enabling two - way communication between guns and their original makers will help guns to be tracked beyond the initial sale , putting greater long - term responsibility on gun makers			1
developing gun software and hardware adaptations could be hastened through a @entity179 - style program			1
this @entity181 agency tries to solve difficult warfare challenges with cutting - edge ideas			0
it gave us gps , among other things			0
in the private sector , rewards can be offered for specific technological achievements , such as what the @entity191 has been doing			0
gun makers , gun retailers , even the @entity195 could underwrite a similar prize			0
gun software could be phased in , starting with the most lethal assault rifles			1
today 's guns are componentized , creating possibilities for a vibrant aftermarket , with add - ons tested and certified by a consortium of gun makers or responsible gun owners			1
technology can not end depravity or violence , but it can limit the evil a person can inflict on others			2
after this latest heart - wrenching massacre , enacting new laws may help us feel like we have done something			0
but smarter technology may actually do a lot more			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .			2

@entity221 *advocates* changing the way guns work with " smart " technology
@entity221 : today 's guns are " dumb , " and making them the same way is *thoughtless*
he says gun software can start with locational " self - awareness " and other simple features
@entity221 : technologists should use their know - how to help reduce gun violence
