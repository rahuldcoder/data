-- born in the @entity2 , @entity1 came to the @entity3 on an academic scholarship to study medicine at @entity6			1
but his career path soon changed after joining the school 's basketball team			0
@entity1 would go on to play in the @entity10 for 18 years and become one of the league 's all - time best defensive players			1
@entity1 has always been involved in humanitarian work , particularly through the @entity15			1
he has been involved with @entity16 since 2007 , when he served on the @entity17 that selects the top heroes of the year			1
@entity1 recently sat down with @entity0 producer @entity19 to talk about heroes and his philanthropy			1
below are excerpts from that interview			0
@entity19 : what was your inspiration for starting the @entity27 ? @entity1 : after traveling so much in @entity29 , doing some work for different organizations , we [ had ] witnessed so much suffering and pain			1
the @entity2 [ has suffered ] more than 10 years of civil unrest , where more than 5.3 million people have died			1
people have [ called it ] the @entity38 of @entity29			1
( shakes his head ) people are left with nothing			2
i decided to create the @entity15 to change the living condition of my people in @entity29			2
@entity19 : you originally intended to be a doctor			0
now you 've built a hospital in your homeland			0
@entity1 : [ it ] was my [ hope ] in building a hospital to let people know that things can be much better in the future			1
... the @entity57 says , " people perish because of lack of education , " and that 's what we are trying to do			1
it 's through education we will reduce the mortality rate : telling those moms how they can keep their babies away from mosquitoes , how they can get their baby vaccinated and deliver the baby in better circumstances			2
there was a woman that delivered a premature baby ; i think that baby was like the size of my hands			0
we were the only hospital that was well - equipped with the high technology			0
the baby was able to grow stronger until it was able to go home			0
to see that child every time i go home is like i gave life to somebody			0
i think each one of us in this world , we have a duty to fulfill our mission			0
@entity92 has blessed some of us in the position to touch many people , and so many people can hear our voices from distances away , and i think i am capable to do it			2
@entity19 : what is a hero to you , and what do you think inspires some of these people ? @entity1 : a hero is someone who inspires you with their voice or with their acts or with their hands			1
@entity19 : you were on the @entity114 back in 2007			2
what was that like ? @entity1 : i think it 's great			1
i [ would ] encourage more people who have the strength and the courage and the love and the commitment of going out and making a difference to go and try			2
... you ca n't just live in a society where you think , " i do n't have anything to contribute			0
" it 's all about the gift that you have			0
... you can inspire so many people			2
@entity19 : you went out to the " @entity16 : an all - star tribute " last year , right ? how was that ? @entity1 : i was just walking down the red carpet , able to meet @entity135 and everybody who came from the different parts of the world , celebrating our work and our contribution to this world			1
@entity19 : so , you 've met some of the @entity16			1
how have you been inspired by them ? @entity1 : oh , inspired a lot			1
to see some of the people -- how they have gone on with no money , with no mean [ s ] -- there 's a lot of people out there who are contributing			2
we all have some obligation to fulfill something in this world we 're living in			0
it does n't matter how long your life [ is ]			0
it is about your contribution , how much difference you 're making			0
