-- " sometimes when i go i feel ashamed and go back without defecating			0
sometimes i wait until dark to go there so no one can see me			0
i will be very concerned about @entity5 , my daughter , going to the bush because it is so far from here			0
at night it is very dangerous			0
a woman and a boy were killed with knives			0
one woman i know of has been raped			0
" these are the words of @entity16 , a young mother from @entity17			0
she has to walk 15 minutes every day to find somewhere to go to the toilet			2
@entity16 and 1.25 billion other women around the world , find themselves in similar situations every day , where they have no choice but to put themselves at risk of disease , harassment or even violence because they lack access to something as simple as a safe and clean toilet			1
today , 19 november , is the first @entity33 recognized @entity34			1
it 's easy to dismiss such days , but recognition of the need to address this issue is vital			2
read this : @entity40 access to a safe toilet is one of the most effective ways of reducing death and disease and improving life for millions			1
every hour 70 women and girls will needlessly die from diseases directly linked to a lack of an adequate toilet and safe drinking water			1
in total one and a quarter million men , women and children will die this year from preventable diseases brought about by a lack of access to these basic services			1
to die for want of a toilet is an outrage that we should not be tolerating			1
that is why @entity67 , @entity68 and the @entity33 partnership organisation , the @entity70 have produced a new report , we ca n't wait , demonstrating the scale and consequences of this problem			1
writing in the foreword to the report , @entity33 deputy secretary - general , @entity78 , and @entity68 chief executive officer , @entity79 , state : " one person in three lacks access to adequate sanitation			1
the result is widespread death and disease -- especially among children -- and social marginalization			0
poor sanitation exposes females to the risk of assault , and when schools can not provide clean , safe toilets girls ' attendance drops			1
" such words from leaders in diplomacy and in business are hugely welcome			0
@entity67 has been providing access to sanitation alongside clean drinking water and hygiene promotion since the early 1980s			1
we have also been banging on the door of governments in both the western and developing world for well over two decades , highlighting the practical steps that could be taken to end this tragedy			0
almost two billion people have gained access to sanitation since 1990			1
many governments have made progress towards meeting the @entity116 that were set in 2000 and are due to achieve many of them by the end of 2015			0
one of those targets is a commitment to halve the proportion of people lacking access to what is called " improved sanitation			2
" at the current rate of progress , this promise is way off track			0
in fact , if we carry on as we are , it will take another 12 years to get the job done			0
even when this goal is finally reached , one in four people will still not have access to safe sanitation			2
universal access is still over 50 years away			2
such a delay is not acceptable			0
what is needed is political will and financing			1
the business case for doing so is extremely strong			0
the @entity142 estimates that every $ 1 invested in sanitation services returns $ 5.50			2
if we halve the proportion of people without access to sanitation , the economic return would be over $ 54 billion per year			1
getting everyone , everywhere access to a toilet would generate over $ 220 billion a year			1
@entity34 is an opportunity to celebrate the progress that has been made and recognizes how much more needs to be done			2
the opinions expressed in this article are solely those of @entity157 .			2

november 19 is the first @entity33 recognized @entity34
@entity67 chief says over 1 billion people are at risk because they lack access to clean toilets
" to die for want of a toilet is an outrage that we should not be tolerating , " says @entity157
she says " political will and financing " is needed to address the problem
