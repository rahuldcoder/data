" without @entity12 action within 15 days , individual employees may begin to receive potential termination notifications , " said spokesman @entity16			0
@entity2 has warned that the state might have to lay off 1,500 state workers if the @entity12 do n't return to meet a quorum to vote on @entity2 's so - called budget repair bill			1

" the measure allows state law enforcement to detain the @entity12 and bring them back to @entity3 , according to @entity69 , a spokesman for @entity71 majority leader @entity70			2
but whether the contempt measure is constitutional remains unclear			0
the state constitution prohibits the arrest of lawmakers while the legislature is in session , except for " treason , felony and breach of the peace			2
" whether @entity3 law enforcement would be permitted jurisdiction in @entity84 to detain the missing lawmakers is also unclear			0
@entity86 state sen. @entity86 said friday that the move threatened to derail any productive discussions between fellow @entity12 and @entity9 , including representatives from the governor 's office			1
" we were pretty close to an agreement " but " then the @entity12 puts out arrest warrants , " he said , blaming @entity12 @entity9 leadership for impeding negotiations			0
the stalemate has appeared increasingly contentious in recent days as @entity12 lawmakers adopted a resolution wednesday that would fine absentee lawmakers $ 100 every day they remain missing			0
a similar resolution passed a day later in @entity102 , where @entity103 @entity9 have imposed a $ 250 - a - day fine against the @entity104 who -- like their @entity3 counterparts -- fled to @entity84 in protest of a labor bill			0
@entity2 's budget - repair bill has drawn fierce and spirited opposition from unions , @entity12 and others , hundreds of whom have demonstrated inside and outside the state @entity13 in recent weeks in @entity114			1

@entity137 , an assembly member , admitted friday that he was " aggressive in attempting to re-enter the @entity13 , and law enforcement was aggressive in trying to keep me out			1
" " this armed - palace environment created by @entity146 has everyone feeling very tense , and emotions are running high , " @entity137 said of the incident , captured on camera by @entity143 - based @entity142			0
