-- the search will continue until at least friday night for 16 people missing since thursday morning when a helicopter carrying them to an offshore oil platform ditched in the @entity7 off @entity8 , @entity2 officials said			1
a helicopter made an emergency crash landing off @entity8 en route to @entity13 oil field on thursday			1
one survivor , identified as @entity15 , was found and taken to a hospital , but efforts to find more survivors had proven fruitless , said maj. @entity19 of the @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22			1
the body of one person , who has not been identified publicly , also was pulled from the water			0
there were 18 people aboard the helicopter when it went down , about 30 nautical miles from @entity31 's			1
" all we 've got is the debris field , " @entity32 said			0
" there are no indications of any [ more ] survivors , but the search will continue			1
" the water is 400 feet deep at the site where the helicopter hit the water , he said			0
helicopters and ships were scouring the debris field thursday evening , and search - and - rescue technicians were planning to use night - vision goggles and flares overnight			2
the debris filled a six - mile area , said @entity52 of the @entity20 in @entity21			0
officials became aware that the helicopter was having problems shortly after 9:10 a.m. , when the pilot declared a mayday , @entity32 said			0
" they declared their mayday and then they hit the water or landed in the water approximately eight minutes later , " he said			0
about 25 minutes later , a helicopter arrived and discovered the survivor , the body , the overturned helicopter and two empty life rafts , he said			0
those aboard should have have been wearing survival suits that would have kept them dry and were equipped with lights and personal locator beacons , but the suits have not helped searchers			1
" we have not received any signals whatsoever , " @entity32 said			0
the suits theoretically would allow wearers to survive 24 hours in the freezing waters -- or until about 9 a.m. friday -- but the search effort was to continue well beyond that			1
" we will continue to search until there 's absolutely no chance that any survivors will be located , " he said			1
" until last light [ friday ]			0
" at that time , based on water temperature and the size of the search area , officials will decide whether to continue the effort , he said			2
early in the day , high winds and seas hampered the search , but by late afternoon , the weather had improved , though seas were still about 13 to 16 feet ( 4 to 5 meters ) and winds were at about 40 knots ( 46 mph )			2
the survivor was taken to the @entity100 in @entity31 's , @entity8			1
the helicopter had been heading to the @entity13 offshore oil platform when it went down in what @entity52 called a controlled emergency crash landing			0
the pilot reported some technical malfunctions before the crash and radioed that he was turning the chopper around , said @entity109 of @entity110 -- the operator of the @entity113 copter .			2
