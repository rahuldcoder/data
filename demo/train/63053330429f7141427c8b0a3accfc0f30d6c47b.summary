@entity0 straps his right arm in bandages , preparing himself to grip the reins of a wildly bucking bronco			0
tall , broad - shouldered , with a rough beard , he steps into his cowboy boots , fits a @entity8 hat and heads out to meet his mount in the rodeo arena			0
@entity0 is a four - time world champion bareback bucking horse rider -- competing in a sport that began in the 19th century heyday of the @entity14			2
with each victory -- he has also won three all - round rodeo championships -- the @entity17 raises awareness of a strong tradition which is rarely seen in the many novels , films and television series dedicated to the tales of the old @entity24 : the historic story of @entity27 's black cowboys			1
on cinema screens and paperback covers , the cowboys of old were heroic , hard - bitten and -- almost always -- white			0
in reality , the @entity24 of the 1800s was traversed by an assortment of black , white , @entity36 and @entity35 cattle hands			1
contemporary records are rare but historians now estimate that up to one in four @entity17 cowboys was @entity40 , while the number of @entity36 cowboys was even greater			1
watch online : the video trailer for the documentary " @entity46 " @entity48 and @entity49 's documentary film -- and multimedia project -- " @entity46 " follows @entity0 and other contemporary black cowboys as they gain a following competing at rodeos and go about their working lives			1
@entity56 - based photographer @entity48 first became interested in the group 10 years ago while watching a news report in @entity59 about local black cowboys holding a parade			1
his interest was immediately piqued : " it 's really nice to find something that 's new , is n't it ? they have been around for hundreds of years , but history has forgotten about them			0
" read related : ' @entity17 in @entity69 ' : junior wranglers find refuge with black cowboys during the 17th and 18th century , many slaves were displaced from areas of @entity75 where cattle herding cultures -- as depicted in 4,000 year old cave paintings at @entity79 , in the south of modern - day @entity81 -- had existed for millennia			1
but historians say that those who became cowboys in the 19th century joined a new cultural tradition -- developed in the company of their @entity89 and @entity35 counterparts -- with different breeds of cattle and new techniques			0
life for a black cowboy was tough , explains @entity95 , @entity97 assistant professor of history at @entity98 , who has edited an anthology of writing on the subject			2
" black cowboys were sometimes expected to do ... more than their white counterpart -- in other words , some of the roughest work			2
" " breaking of stock ( taming horses ) and getting horses ready to ride each morning was often the work of the black cowboy -- where there were black cowboys -- and when they had to cross a swollen river to move cattle ... black cowboys were the first to cross that river			1
" @entity114 -- known to his students as cowboy @entity117 -- lectures in a check shirt , bandana and ten gallon hat			0
he explains that life as a cowboy was still preferable to other roles given to slaves and , later , free @entity40 in the @entity126 , such as picking cotton on a plantation			2
" many black cowboys , when they were slaves , were n't treated as you 'd think a traditional slave would be treated , because a cowboy needed a lot more independence , " said @entity95			1
in @entity27 : top - ranked polo players hail from @entity138 's inner city even after the abolition of slavery , prejudice and discrimination were still common -- but black cowboys could expect a better relationship with white @entity40 than many			1
@entity48 talks about a " cowboy code " of equal responsibility , teamwork and mutual protection binding today 's cowboys and their black and white ancestors			1
@entity117 agrees that a kind of loyalty developed between cowboys of different races -- but suggests that cowboys were initially united by necessity			0
" if you 've got nine or 10 cowboys on a cattle drive , you are interdependent with the folk who are riding with you -- they can either save your life or they can let you die			0
" there are times when you really need the assistance of another cowboy			0
that was not the place to be too prejudiced or too hostile to the cowboy riding next to you , " says @entity48 , the filmmaker			0
asked how the image of the black cowboy disappeared from popular culture , @entity48 points the finger at the western movie business of the mid- 20th century			1
" @entity175 played a major part in dismissing the role of black cowboys			1
in 99 % of @entity75 cowboy films , there is no black cowboy			2
" " @entity27 was a divided country -- segregation -- @entity175 played their part down			0
compare @entity184 or @entity185 to the black cowboys			2
it just does n't fit the image			0
