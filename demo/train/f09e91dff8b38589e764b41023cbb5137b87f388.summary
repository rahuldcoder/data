@entity0 and @entity2 have the same laugh and the same freckled cheeks			2
they wear their hair the same way and have since they were babies			2
they share a hatred of cooked carrots , a love of the same color nail polish and the need to sleep 10 hours a day			1
the pair tease , poke and prod each other like they 've grown up together , but they did n't			1
neither woman knew she had an identical twin sister until less than two years ago			1
that 's where the power of the @entity21 , a lot of luck and a series of " what ifs " enter the picture			2
i sat down with the 26 - year - old sisters in @entity30 recently to talk about their new book " @entity32 : a @entity33 of @entity34 , " which chronicles their thoroughly modern reunion			1
@entity0 , who grew up in @entity37 , is an aspiring fashion designer who was studying in @entity38			2
on a saturday in december 2012 , while she was on a bus , a friend sent her a screen shot of a @entity43 video featuring @entity2 , who is an actress			2
" i 'm automatically thinking , ' oh , who posted a video of me on @entity43 ? ' " she said with a laugh			2
when she got home , she looked again and realized it was n't her but a girl who looked exactly like her who lived in the @entity51			1
she looked for credits on the video to find the woman 's name but could n't find anything , so she dropped the matter			1
that was until the same friend who sent the screen shot said he saw the girl from the video in a movie trailer , also on @entity43 , about a month later			2
@entity0 's investigative instincts kicked into overdrive			0
she learned @entity2 's name and discovered they shared a birthday and were both adopted in @entity69			0
" i stalk her a little bit more , learn that she was actually born in the same port city in @entity69 , and yes , started looking through all her pictures			0
" she got up her nerve and decided to contact @entity2 via @entity74 , sending her a friend request and a message			1
the similarities between her story and the film " @entity80 , " featuring @entity81 in the most recent version , were not lost on @entity83			1
she wrote in her message to @entity2 : " i do n't want to be too @entity81 , well ... but ... how to put it ... i was wondering where you were born ? " @entity2 , who was raised in @entity88 , @entity89 , and who has two brothers ( her parents ' biological sons ) and a half - brother from her father 's previous marriage , at first did n't know what to make of @entity0 's friend request and message			1
" it 's pretty strange to get a message from yourself on @entity74 , " she said			1
" it 's a really weird experience			0
" it took her a few days to respond			0
" i thought , ' wow , this could actually be true , ' " @entity2 said			0
the first time they talked on @entity109 , they were supposed to chat for 90 minutes but ended up talking for three hours -- a conversation that proved to be life - changing			1
" we were 25 at the time , and it 's like that quarter - life crisis thing when you think it 's all downhill , " @entity2 said			1
" i have to buy my health insurance			0
i 'm getting kicked off my parents ' ( plan )			0
there 's nothing good any more , and then it teaches you that anything 's possible			0
" for @entity0 , an only child , discovering she had a sister was amazing , but realizing that she had a twin was " even crazier , because you have so much in common			1
" " you have a very strong bond that you ca n't actually explain , but we understand each other without even really talking , " @entity0 said			1
" i could see her body language			0
... we understand each other right away			0
" a dna test proved what they already knew -- that they were , in fact , twins -- and now they planned to meet in person for the first time in @entity38			0
" the only way to explain it is being the most intense long - distance relationship and talking over months on social media and @entity109 , " @entity2 said			1
but connecting on the @entity21 was one thing ; meeting in person was " still really scary , " she said			0
@entity0 said she found herself at that first meeting needing to keep her distance , because it all felt " very strange , " but at the same time wanting some proof that her identical twin sister was real			1
" so i just poked her , " she said during the interview , at which point they both laughed			0
their reunion , which they each chronicle in alternating chapters in the book , is also part of a documentary , which they are producing and hope to release next year			1
the support they have received as their story has gotten national attention and the interest they have had from other adoptees and twins have motivated them to try to raise awareness and provide resources for international adoptions			1
" it inspired us to become something bigger than just ourselves and to share our story for a reason , " @entity2 said			1
she and @entity0 have teamed up with @entity2 's friend , fellow actress @entity180 , a @entity181 - @entity51 adoptee and cast member on " @entity183 , " to start a foundation called kindred			1
the foundation is focused on helping adoptees , both in the @entity51 and worldwide , with family reunions and any other issues they might encounter			1
" it 's such a joy to find your family , " @entity0 said			1
" i guess when you 're adopted , you 're always looking for somebody that looks like you , that will understand you			0
" both women say their parents are delighted with the news , although they were upset initially , since neither set of parents knew the girls had a twin			1
their adoption papers list their births as a single birth , they said			0
" of course , my mom was very protective and said , ' we would have taken both of you ' when they felt that we were missing out on growing up together , " @entity2 said			0
they have tried to reach out to their birth mother but reveal in the book that she has not been interested in connecting with them			2
" if we 've learned anything in this story , it 's that things will happen as they should , " @entity2 said			2
" and if one day she wants to reach out to us , then we 're here , and we 're willing , and we 're ready			2
" though they still live halfway around the world from each other , @entity0 in @entity37 and @entity2 in @entity220 , they text multiple times every day			2
" basically , i wake up to 20 text messages , ' what are you doing ? ' ' i 'm on my way to work			0
' ' it 's cold out , ' " @entity2 said			0
" it 's just completely arbitrary things that happen during the day			2
" @entity0 says @entity2 is always waking her up in the morning via text because of the time difference			0
she 'll get messages like , " @entity236 , you 're late , " she said			0
" it 's amazing to feel that someone is always awake somewhere in the world , and you feel protected , " @entity0 said			0
they may have been torn apart as babies , but they say they are now forever bonded			0
" we 're not worried about being separated again , " @entity2 said			0
what do you think about the twins ' story ? tell @entity249 on @entity250 or @entity251 on @entity74 .			1

identical twin sisters did n't know the other existed for the first 25 years of their lives
they connected via @entity74 in a modern - day " @entity80 " story
in a new book " @entity263 , " the sisters document how they found each other
the sisters hope their story will help other adoptees reunite with family
