@entity0 -- first the attackers blew up bombs outside a @entity5 prison			0
then they scared off people in the area and used loudspeakers to call out specific inmates they were trying to release			0
@entity11 prisoners left inside were killed			0
" it was a well - planned assault , " noted @entity1 national security analyst @entity12 , who provided details monday of the july 30 prison break in northwest @entity5			1
other similar operations in the past two weeks in @entity17 and @entity18 successfully freed hundreds of convicted or suspected @entity20 terrorists , a known strategy of @entity23 leader @entity22			0
@entity24 and other analysts cited the prison breaks as one of several reasons the @entity29 has dramatically heightened its security stance by issuing a worldwide travel alert and closing almost two dozen embassies and consulates on sunday , with 19 of them remaining shut for the rest of the week			1
the @entity36 said the substantial security steps reflect an " abundance of caution " over intelligence information that indicated final planning by @entity23 in @entity42 for possible terrorist attacks on @entity45 targets to coincide with the end of @entity47 this week			1
' do something ' an intercepted message among senior @entity23 operatives in the last several days further intensified concerns already heightened by increased terrorist chatter detected by intelligence agencies , as well as the prison breaks			1
a message from @entity22 to his second in command in @entity42 told him to " do something , " @entity1 has learned			2
@entity29 and @entity42 officials had already spent weeks watching a rising stream of intelligence about the possibility of a major terrorist attack in @entity42 , so the message caused them to fear imminent terrorist action			1
@entity1 had the information over the weekend and decided not to report the details about @entity22 's involvement based on @entity29 government concerns about the sensitivity of the information			1
now that it has been widely reported in other media , including the @entity72 and @entity73 , @entity1 has now decided to report it as well			2
and @entity29 officials cautioned that there may be multiple sources of intelligence , including intercepts of electronic information from phone calls and web postings and the interrogation of couriers or other operatives			1
opinion : what 's behind timing of terror threat asked monday about the prison breaks , @entity36 spokeswoman @entity88 called them " a concern for the international community " that is " separate and apart " from the @entity29 concern about the latest specific terrorist threat			1
@entity12 , however , noted that @entity23 " actually announced a year ago that they were going to do this campaign of releasing prisoners from prison and they conducted something like seven prison assaults -- a couple of which have been quite successful			0
" prison breaks a senior official with @entity17 's interior ministry told @entity1 on condition of not being identified that top officials of @entity23 in @entity17 , including @entity109 , escaped from @entity111 prison during the jailbreak there last month and remains at large			1
@entity12 noted that a 2006 prison break in the @entity42 capital , @entity115 , led to the creation of @entity117 , one of the terrorist organization 's most virulent affiliates			0
although the prison breaks are not the main reason for the raised terror threat , said @entity125 analyst @entity124 , " it is part of the background music			1
" prison breaks can often strengthen terrorist groups because " some of these guys are likely to be seasoned operatives , " he added			1
to @entity1 national security contributor @entity133 , the timing of the prison breaks and increased intelligence chatter building up to the end of @entity47 signaled heightened @entity23 activity that required precautionary steps in response			1
she noted that in the run - up to the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , " the government failed to connect dots			0
" " these seem like dots that ought to be connected , " said @entity145 , a former homeland security and anti-terrorism adviser to the @entity149 administration			2
" you can figure out later whether or not you were right			0
" is rash of brazen prison breaks related ? @entity155 wants to know another dot she cited was that @entity22 recently appointed @entity158 , the @entity42 leader of @entity117 , to be the new general manager of the global @entity23 network			1
@entity1 has learned @entity22 's message for action was sent to @entity163			2
a high - profile attack orchestrated by @entity158 would cement the @entity42 's new position in the @entity23 hierarchy , @entity145 said			0
@entity42 is an area of particular concern			0
three sources said the @entity29 has information that members of the @entity42 - based @entity117 ( @entity117 ) are in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack			0
according to a @entity29 official with access to the latest intelligence , @entity158 's appointment as a top global @entity23 figure would almost certainly have required back - and - forth communication between @entity117 and @entity23 central			2
at the @entity182 , spokesman @entity181 told reporters monday that while @entity29 anti-terrorism efforts had decimated @entity23 's global leadership and greatly diminished its core in the @entity189 - @entity5 region , the threat still posed " has shifted to some of these affiliates , in particular @entity117			0
" over the weekend , @entity155 warned that @entity23 has been tied to the prison breaks on july 23 in @entity17 , on july 26 in @entity18 and four days later in @entity5			1
end of @entity47 another factor prompting the embassy and consulate closures is the end of @entity47			2
depending on when a new crescent moon is seen , the @entity197 could end wednesday or thursday			0
@entity47 's end is celebrated with the @entity199 -- a three - day holiday in most @entity201 countries			2
the @entity36 , in announcing its closures , alluded to this , saying that " a number of our embassies and consulates were going to be closed in accordance with local custom and practice for the bulk of the week for the @entity199 celebration at the end of @entity47			1
" @entity213 also announced its embassy in @entity42 will remain closed through the end of @entity199 " due to continuing security concerns			0
" strategic reason @entity145 said there could be a strategic reason for shutting down the diplomatic offices			0
" once you take targets away , it buys you additional time to try and disrupt , to identify the cell , the operators in country and the region , and work with your partners in the region to try and ... get them in custody or disrupt the plot , " she said			0
" so , some of this operationally is about buying time			0
" list of closures a total of 19 @entity29 embassies and consulates will be closed monday through saturday			1
the following 15 were part of the original list : @entity29 embassy @entity245 , @entity247 @entity29 embassy @entity248 , @entity250 @entity29 @entity251 , @entity252 @entity29 @entity253 , @entity254 @entity29 embassy @entity255 , @entity255 @entity29 @entity257 , @entity258 @entity29 @entity259 , @entity247 @entity29 consulate @entity260 , @entity254 @entity29 @entity262 , @entity263 @entity29 embassy @entity265 , @entity266 @entity29 @entity267 , @entity268 @entity29 @entity269 , @entity270 @entity29 embassy @entity271 , @entity254 @entity29 @entity273 , @entity42 @entity29 @entity274 , @entity18 the following four embassies have been added : @entity29 @entity276 , @entity277 @entity29 @entity278 , @entity279 @entity29 @entity280 , @entity281 @entity29 embassy @entity282 , @entity284 @entity1 's @entity286 , @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 and @entity285 contributed to this report .			2
