@entity0 -- they share the same rotund facial features , similar expressions and gait			0
but the two sons of @entity8 have never met , and based on a new book being published in @entity10 this week , there appears to be little fraternal allegiance , at least from the eldest son 's side			1
@entity14 , the eldest son , is the half - brother of @entity15 , the new leader of @entity16			1
@entity14 believes his youngest brother will fail as the " supreme leader " of the reclusive state , according to the book 's author , @entity20			1
" he 's not comfortable that his younger brother is succeeding the power of @entity8 , " says @entity20 , the author of " my father , @entity8 , and me , " which will hit bookshelves in @entity0 on wednesday			1
" he ( @entity14 ) sees his brother failing			1
he thinks he ( @entity15 ) has a lack of experience , he 's too young , and he did n't have enough time to be groomed			1
those three reasons are why he thinks he 'll fail			0
" @entity14 is the most public of @entity8 's sons , known primarily for his blunders and semi-exile from @entity16			1
an overweight and careless playboy , @entity14 enraged his father more than a decade ago when he was arrested slipping into @entity10 with forged documents -- simply to visit @entity38			2
@entity14 lives in @entity39 and @entity40 and has occasionally popped up in the @entity10 news media			2
it was during one of those appearances in front of @entity10 reporters -- in @entity47 , during 2004 -- that @entity20 , a reporter for the @entity48 , first met @entity14			2
they exchanged email addresses and began an occasional correspondence			0
in the past few years , @entity20 said they had begun to write more , exchanging 150 emails			0
last year , @entity14 agreed to meet with @entity20 in @entity40 and @entity47 for interviews			2
what surprised @entity20 the most , he said , is that the eldest of @entity8 's sons was very smart and knowledgeable about the world -- and open - minded , especially about economic reforms			1
" he spoke out against his father 's ' military first ' policy , " says @entity20 , countering widely held notions that the @entity38 debacle caused @entity14 to fall out of favor with his father			1
" he wants @entity16 to embrace economic reform and open its doors			0
" @entity14 painted a picture of a father who was strict but was often warm - hearted to his eldest son , @entity20 said , especially on special occasions			1
" @entity8 called his son on his birthday , " @entity20 said			2
@entity14 says the half - brothers were kept apart , following an ancient history of raising potential successors separately			1
he says his father refused to discuss the succession of power for many years because it signaled his own death , according to @entity20 -- only after his illness accelerated did the succession begin			0
both sons were educated in @entity84 , leaving @entity14 convinced that his country needed to embrace economic reforms			2
@entity14 believes his brother wo n't have the power to push through reforms , @entity20 said			2
" he 's afraid the youngest son has no idea , no vision about economic reform , " he said			0
professor @entity93 of @entity94 says @entity14 has been fairly public in the past , keeping his distance from the regime 's inner circle			1
@entity93 says he believes the latest comments are the reaction of a normal , intelligent human being who has a good understanding of the situation in @entity16			0
" i would say maybe this smart , overweight playboy from @entity40 has the highest chances of physical survival of all the @entity8 children , " says @entity93			0
" in the long run , the history of the @entity16 state is going to end badly			0
we might see a coup , a revolution , a conspiracy , because in the very long run the system is not sustainable , " @entity93 said			0
" he ( @entity14 ) is away , he is secure			0
it is quite possible that many of his siblings will die a violent death sooner or later , and he is likely to live until an old age , writing memoirs , explaining to everybody how misunderstood his family was			0
