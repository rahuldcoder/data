-- with president @entity3 's re-election , many liberals believe they possess the building blocks of the winning political coalition of the future : college students , single women , gays , secularists , hispanics , african - americans and @entity13			1
liberals see here not a splintered electorate but key constituencies united by a common agenda of economic and social justice			1
in previous columns , i have conceded the strength of the @entity22 in these quarters			2
fifty , 25 , perhaps even 10 years ago , this brand of liberalism probably would have failed			0
but today , the country , the demographics and the culture are different			0
@entity29 are less white , less religious and less likely to get married and have families			0
for the college student struggling with student loan debt , the single mother who can barely afford to provide for her children , the minority family in the inner city struggling to find work , liberalism offers immediate relief : subsidized student loans , national health care and entitlements for the elderly and the poor			1
rather than waiting on free markets to correct themselves and start creating wealth again , liberalism 's cure is immediate , and so are the political payoffs			0
this explains partly why many voters feel liberals care about them more than conservatives			2
for the ideologically driven -- the pro-choice , pro-gay - marriage voters and @entity58 of the world ( she was the @entity60 student at the center of a birth control debate this year ) -- liberalism offers a slightly different relief : the rejection of the central role of mediating institutions -- like churches , families and community organizations -- in imposing moral standards to govern or regulate behavior within the state			2
politics : the new @entity29 -- what the election teaches us about ourselves churches and families can exist , says liberalism , so long as they exercise " soft " religion and do n't force their views on the public			0
when they do , like in the case of the @entity86 and contraception , it 's necessary , says liberalism , for the state to step in and impart justice			1
this explains @entity94 's contraception mandate and why much was made over the " war on women			2
" liberalism has effectively persuaded its many factions that it is uniquely qualified to meet their needs and desires , while conservatism has not			0
by its nature , liberalism molds to fit these times better than conservatism ; conservatism is by its nature more abstract than practical , more focused on long - term considerations than short term			0
does this mean that conservatism is past its time and that liberalism is the mandate of the future ? no , it does n't			0
liberalism 's continued success depends on many factors , but two in particular			0
first , it must paint the political alternative , conservatism , as the faction of social injustice , as anti-immigrant , anti-entitlement , anti-regulation and so on			2
the @entity3 campaign did that effectively in this election without an equally effective conservative response			1
one presumes that conservatives will be ready in 2016			0
second , and more important , effective state intervention of the sort liberals propose depends almost entirely on a state that is strong economically and socially			1
it is here that liberalism falls short in the long term			0
the various liberal constituencies are in fact atomized groups of individuals who are relying on government , rather than creating the economic growth or fostering the social and civic health necessary to sustain the ideal liberal state			1
whereas liberals see entitlements as the immediate response to economic injustice , many fail to realize that they alone can not rebuild a middle class			1
in fact , they can have the opposite effect in the long term and insulate their recipients from upward mobility			0
with $ 16 trillion in national debt , an aging population and an already - overburdened entitlement system , the ideal liberal social welfare state can only sustain itself for so long before it collapses under its own weight			1
it is a lifeline attached to a slowly sinking ship			0
politics : the new @entity29 electorate arrives whereas liberals celebrate subsidized birth control and the unmooring of what they see as narrow - minded religious moral standards , they fail to realize the alternative that is right in front of them : out - of - wedlock birth rates that are at all - time highs and a destructive breakdown in the family unit			1
absent strong , active , character - forming institutions , like families , schools , and churches , single mothers and low - income households in many cases have no where else to turn but to the government			2
the problem is that liberals often confuse such allegiance with successful governing			2
the liberal coalition of the future looks more like @entity195 , an advanced secular , social welfare state , than the idealized liberal glory days of @entity199			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			1

@entity202 : since @entity3 won , liberals think winning coalition is diverse new groups
he says it *include* gays , *blacks* , hispanics , @entity13 , students , single women
they want economic , social justice ( aka entitlements ) ; reject social unifiers like church , family
@entity202 : entitlement state collapses without economic growth , shared social *structures*
