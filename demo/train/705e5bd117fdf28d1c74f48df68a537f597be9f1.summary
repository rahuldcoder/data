in the background of the family portrait , @entity13 saw an image of someone reaching into his bag as it sat. he took it to the @entity17 @entity64 , which immediately went into action			1
" the @entity64 are amazing , " @entity13 said			1
" i fully expected to have them tell us to just fill a report [ out ] or [ to ] tell us there was n't much they could do , but [ they ] responded immediately and because they did , they were able to catch [ a suspect ]			2
" after @entity13 showed the pictures , two officers were immediately dispatched to look for a suspect , while a third stayed with @entity13 and sent out a description			0
within 15 minutes , @entity13 said , police had arrested a suspect and also located the bag and all his belongings , some of which had been thrown away during the heist			1

he was released tuesday from @entity89 on a signature bond			0
it was not known tuesday night whether @entity87 had an attorney			0
