@entity0 -- president @entity3 's newly revamped @entity2 is reigniting a contentious debate across the ideological spectrum over whether religious organizations that accept funds from the government should be allowed to discriminate when hiring			1
on the campaign trail , president @entity3 's views on federal money and discrimination seemed clear			1
in one corner is a string of religion - backed organizations that have accepted federal funds from the 8 - year - old program to advance their secular charity work			2
president @entity19 issued an executive order in 2002 that allowed these groups to continue their practice of discrimination with respect to hiring			1
specifically , many of the organizations carry policies against hiring outside their religion or hiring homosexuals whose lifestyles conflict with church doctrines			0
in the other corner are separation - of - church - and - state advocates and human - rights organizations that say the government must constitutionally compel these organizations to follow nondiscrimination laws if they accept federal funding			0
anything less , they say , would at best be a violation of church - state separation and at worst an implicit endorsement of discrimination			0
" [ president @entity3 ] is under heavy pressure from those who support faith - based hiring in these enterprises to not just eliminate it , " said @entity45 , a professor at the @entity46			1
" others say that hiring on the basis of religion is discriminatory and that the government should never subsidize that			2
as a political matter , there is a lot of pressure from both sides			0
" @entity3 himself waded into the debate during the presidential campaign , delivering a widely viewed speech in @entity65 , @entity66 , during which he endorsed faith - based programs , but said the beneficiaries of such government aid should be forced to cease discriminatory practices			1
" if you get a federal grant , you ca n't use that grant money to proselytize to the people you help and you ca n't discriminate against them -- or against the people you hire -- on the basis of their religion , " @entity3 said in the july 1 speech at the @entity72			1
but since @entity80 , the president and his aides have been far less clear on whether the new faith - based initiatives office will significantly depart from the @entity19 administration 's policy			1
in an executive order to be announced on thursday , @entity3 does not rescind @entity19 's provision to allow faith - based groups to discriminate in their hiring practices , but does provide a legal process for organizations to go through in order to that ensure hiring is legal and non-discriminatory			1
administration sources say the new legal safeguard is a " key step forward " in addressing the thorny issue of faith - based hiring			1
but dr. @entity102 , a senior pastor at @entity103 in @entity104 , @entity105 , who will be part of a 25 - member council of religious leaders in the faith - based office , said the issue is a particularly tricky one for religious leaders			1
" we 're going to have to work that out , because on the one hand , you do n't want to use federal funds to discriminate			1
but on the other hand , we ca n't have religious organizations taking money on the condition that they will hire people who live a lifestyle contrary to what they teach , " he said			2
if the @entity3 administration moves slowly on resolving the issue , the new president risks alienating a large bloc of his supporters , many of whom are already wary of faith - based funding from the federal government			1
" in an ideal world , there would be no faith - based office , " said the rev. @entity137 , executive director of @entity138			0
" but if we must have this office , certain steps must be taken to bring it into line with the commands of the @entity147			0
" for the faith - based groups , the issue is not so clear - cut			2
under the @entity151 , faith - based organizations have a right to discriminate in hiring with respect to religion			2
many of these organizations argue they risk losing their fundamental identity if the government forces them to hire individuals outside their faith			0
" to us , it 's not a matter of discrimination , it 's a matter of our faith ethos , " said @entity161 , the president of the @entity162			0
" what they are telling us is to negate who we are in order to acquire federal grants			0
... that 's just unacceptable			0
" @entity161 , whose organization represents more than 19,000 churches , said he and other religious leaders have directly communicated their concerns to the @entity3 administration and are confident the president will not seek to rescind the policy			2
" president @entity3 understands he 's at risk of alienating the vast majority of the evangelical community , " @entity161 said			2
but opponents argue organizations use the right to hire within their religion as an excuse to implicitly discriminate against gays and lesbians -- many of whom may share the same faith as the organization but are deemed not good practitioners of it			0
" the @entity19 administration 's policies and initiatives that have allowed religious institutions to discriminate against [ lesbian , gay , bisexual and transsexual ] @entity205 with public money are not consistent with the values espoused by president @entity3 and his @entity208 , " @entity197 , president of the @entity198 said			1
" we are hopeful that the new administration will take the necessary steps to address this critical issue of fairness expeditiously			0
" at pastor @entity215 's presidential forum in august , then - presidential candidate @entity3 said a distinction should be made between how federally funded groups hire within their own mission and how they hire when it comes to secular charitable work			1
" the devil 's in the details , " he said then			0
" what we do want to make sure of is that as a general principle we 're not using federal funding to discriminate , but that is only when it comes to the narrow program that is being funded by the federal government			0
that does not affect any of the other ministries that are being taken , that are taking place			0

@entity19 faith office allowed religious groups to discriminate in hiring
during campaign , @entity3 said federal money should n't go to discriminatory groups
@entity3 faith office 's position on the issue is *unclear* so far
religious , secular groups take stands on both sides
