-- you have your assignment , you 've gathered your elements			0
now what ? it 's time to put your story together			1
as a @entity0 all - platform journalist , it 's my responsibility to research stories and follow news events in a specific region			1
i am stationed in @entity13 , @entity14 , and cover both local and long - distance assignments			0
this unique , hybrid position is a combination of field and package producing , writing for television , shooting video and still photos , plus off - air or on - air reporting			1
in essence , an @entity8 is a reporter , correspondent , producer and video editor in one			0
otherwise known as a one - woman band			0
below are essential tips to keep in mind when out in the field			1
choosing a story : although not all stories make for good multimedia production , the best multimedia stories are multidimensional			1
and that means there is enough action for video , strong emotions for still photographs and compelling sources for text to help better explain the topic			0
finding the angle : the key to a successful story is uncovering the reason audiences should care about it			1
when thinking about the story , ask yourself " so what ? " or " who cares ? " answering these questions will ultimately tell your story			1
without an angle , without a reason for what you 're covering , you 're just left with moving pictures or words on a page			1
storyboarding : before you head out the door , allow for some time to create a rough sketch of how to organize a story and a list of its contents			1
determine what the story is about , who can explain the subject matter and how the story will look			1
doing so will help focus and define the parameters of the story			1
think of this as the directions for the recipe to your favorite casserole -- it tells you how to put the story together			1
shoot to edit : regardless of your deadline , you want to shoot video and stills , or gather audio , of exactly what you need for your story			1
you do this so that when its time to edit , you will spend less time looking for what you need			2
when you have more time to work on a story , shoot multiple takes of the same subject for editing variety and for a more creative and narrative approach to the story			2
the basics for your story should include the subject , and any other elements that help explain the story , externals of a building , streets , the scene of an accident , etc. allow for silences ; do n't interrupt : this advice from mastering the art of interviewing also holds true for when it comes to doing on - camera interviews			1
most people need some time to grapple with their thoughts and formulate responses			0
it 's on you to give them that space			0
and when you 're editing video , the last thing you want is to hear yourself on camera interrupting your subject			0
respond with gestures and pause between questions			0
you want clear in and outs to sound - bites so you can more easily edit your package			2
pulling it together : it 's important for you to decide the parts of a story , the flow of a story , and what 's most important in each section of your story			2
even the most seasoned journalists must be reminded that every good story has a beginning , middle and end			1
edit , edit , edit : you may love everything you 've written , everything you 've shot and everything else about your story			1
@entity152 , you may even love yourself for the great work you did			2
pick out the strongest quotes and the strongest visuals			0
tell the story , do n't be the story : it is your job to cover an event or profile an individual			2
this means , stay out of the way			0
there will be times you may want to shoot a standup because it helps move a complicated story along , or you may need to track a package because there is a lot of information that needs to be conveyed			2
that 's all part of the job			0
what 's not part of the job is making the story about you			2
do n't force it : let the story dictate your approach			2
if the video is limited or if the subject is n't compelling , move on			0
some stories are n't easy to tell visually , but work well in print			0
if that 's the case , do that			0
just because you do n't have video does n't mean you failed			0
interestingly enough , people will tolerate bad video , but they will not forgive poor audio			0
have fun : this one 's a no - brainer			0
if you 're not loving what you 're doing , stop			0
ready to give this a try ? here 's your challenge : put all your boot camp knowledge to the test and create a ca n't - miss report about a local landmark where you live			1
