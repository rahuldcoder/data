@entity0 -- the @entity3 administration 's got some good news on @entity5			1
it was arguably great news			0
despite the jumbo embarrassment of a flawed rollout , a website that barely worked for more than a month , and hellfire and brimstone headlines that impacted public perceptions of the law , it turns out people are signing up			2
according to data released wednesday , more than 1 million people signed up for private health insurance under the @entity5 exchanges during january			1
that raised the open enrollment total during the first four months to 3.3 million			1
@entity5 sign - ups jump to 3.3 million with six weeks left for people to enroll under current deadlines , there is an outside chance the @entity3 administration could hit its goal of 7 million by the end of march			1
seems like a big deal , right ? you would n't know it from the way the @entity35 rolled out the news , quietly on a media conference call with the @entity38			0
there was no tv - friendly event featuring president @entity3			0
instead , he appeared in public on wednesday only to sign an executive order raising the minimum wage for the employees of contractors entering into new agreements with the federal government			0
read the new report sure , that 's a big symbolic move			0
but its impact is fractional compared to those affected by a fully functioning health law			0
@entity54 , the ratio of sign ups 18 to 34 ticked up in the last reporting month to 25 % of the total			1
and they 're buying mid-range plans that are more generous but cost more with higher monthly premiums			2
it 's not the 40 % young people ratio that government economists have said will be needed to make the program financially workable			1
but the administration 's argument has always been younger enrollees -- less interested in the law and less in need of benefits -- would generally be the last to sign up			0
new system system to measure payments for @entity5 coverage so why then , as @entity74 points out , is the @entity75 controlled by @entity35 minority leader @entity76 running tv ads for @entity79 rep. @entity78 in @entity80 that do n't brag about how the law is turning around ? instead , @entity78 is promising to stand up to insurance companies to fix it			1
@entity3 , in his @entity84 in january , implored @entity85 to work with @entity79 on the law instead of continuing the years long political game of finding ways to vote against it			2
a strategy that @entity79 quickly found ways to squelch in the @entity92			2
" let 's not have another 40 - something votes to repeal a law that 's already helping millions of @entity96 , " @entity3 said			0
" the first 40 were plenty			0
" republicans , even as they clearly move away from a strategy of trying to repeal the law , will still use it as a political bludgeon against @entity79 in the run up to midterm elections			1
it remains an issue that is important to the @entity85 base			0
democrats , for their part , will try to frame @entity85 assaults on the law as attempts to take something tangible -- cancer treatment , say , or health insurance -- away from people			0
talking to @entity79 strategists , you wo n't hear any of them telling candidates to run on @entity5 no matter how good the numbers look and no matter if it starts to appear that the law is working			1
and you ca n't blame them			0
for all the talk of @entity5 as @entity3 's signature -- literally , his name is in the colloquial title -- achievement , the law dominated the political conversation for years			2
the backlash cost @entity79 their majority in the @entity35			2
public support , never strong , is still below 50 % for the @entity5 even as millions sign up for coverage			1
new delay ensures @entity5 to be issue in 2014 , 2016 elections that 's why even as portions of the law seem ready to finally , potentially , work , @entity79 seem keen to move on even as they try not to run away from the politics of @entity5			1
" there 's a disconnect between talking about numbers in the exchanges and how this law affects people in their every day lives , " said @entity142 , spokesman for the @entity79 @entity143			1
" @entity79 candidates are going to be talking about preexisting conditions , consumer protections , protecting @entity155 benefits			2
these are health care issues that relate to people in ( their ) every day lives and @entity85 are on the wrong side of these issues , " he said .			0

3.3 million signed up during the four months of @entity5 open enrollment so far
the ratio of people 18 to 34 signing up for plans *increased* to 25 %
despite this *success* , @entity79 strategists will likely not *advise* candidates to run on @entity5
republicans will still use *problems* with @entity5 to hit @entity79 hard
