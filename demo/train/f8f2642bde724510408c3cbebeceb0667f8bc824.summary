-- when i was a federal prosecutor , i had some sleepless nights			0
on a few occasions , it was after i had lost at trial ; i would lie in bed and think of what i did wrong			0
other times , though , my sleepless hours came after i had won a trial or gotten what i wanted at sentencing			0
the haunting question was always the same : what if i was wrong ? some might consider that admission a sign of weakness or a lack of resolve , but in retrospect , i see those nights as ones in which i was fully human			0
the cost of being wrong as a prosecutor is almost unthinkable			0
this is especially true in a capital case , such as the recent and tumultuous end game in the @entity28 case in @entity29			1
@entity28 ' final appeals to the state of @entity29 were denied , despite the fact that seven of the nine witnesses against him had recanted their stories			1
his last hope , the @entity38 @entity37 , denied his application for a stay of execution on wednesday night , sealing his fate			0
he was executed shortly after 11 p.m. the meaningful cases in law almost always involve a clash of virtues			0
school prayer cases , for instance , sometimes balance two virtues reflected in the @entity50 itself : the guarantee of free exercise of religion , and a bar on the establishment of a state religion			2
in the @entity28 case , what virtues were in conflict ? on the side of execution without further delay , the virtue upheld is that of " finality of judgment			1
" that is , once a verdict and judgment are rendered , it should be difficult to upset			2
victims ' family members sometimes see a promise in that judgment , and finality renders a certainty to the process that some see as promoting deterrence of crime			1
@entity90 , in passing bills such as 1996 's anti-terrorism and @entity84 ( which strictly limited the ability of someone like @entity28 to receive relief by petitioning for a writ of habeas corpus ) , sought to promote this value			1
the @entity37 has also repeatedly cited " finality of judgment " as an important value in cutting off appeals			1
other than the mention of capital punishment itself , it is hard to see much support in the @entity50 for the virtue of finality			1
on the other hand , those seeking to delay the execution of @entity28 for reconsideration of the evidence promoted other virtues : deliberation and mercy			1
unlike " finality of judgment , " these virtues are firmly rooted in the @entity50 itself and the core values of @entity38			1
deliberation is a predominant central virtue promoted by the @entity50			1
that document requires that in criminal cases , there be an initial appearance , indictment by a grand jury , representation by counsel and the right to not only appeal a conviction but to petition for habeas corpus			0
all of these slow down the process			2
above all , our constitution expressly mandates " @entity133 , " even when that process produces delay and uncertainty , as it is bound to do			0
deliberation is what makes us civilized , and when it fails , we fail profoundly			0
a second virtue , mercy , is also an explicit part of the @entity50			2
the federalists insisted on the inclusion of the pardon power , for example , for the express reason that it gives the system some outlet for this core virtue			0
( in @entity28 ' case , it is the @entity149 that had the power to grant clemency )			1
the first signer of that @entity50 was @entity153 , who then lived out the virtues of that @entity50 as president			0
he was literally the commander - in - chief ; when the @entity157 arose in western @entity158 , he personally led the army to quell the rebels , astride a white horse			0
just as importantly , living out the constitutional virtue of mercy , he pardoned those rebels who were sentenced to hang for treason			2
the @entity28 case shows us a truth : we have wandered too far from our own best virtues			1
if we are to err , let it be on the side of deliberation and mercy , rather than the unsettling finality we have seen pursued by the @entity29			1
should we choose those better virtues , we might all sleep better			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			2

@entity178 : courts considering @entity28 case had to balance values
he says the *argument* to proceed was the virtue of " finality of judgment "
he says conflicting values relate to *due* process and the virtue of mercy
@entity178 : we should err on the side of further deliberation and of mercy
