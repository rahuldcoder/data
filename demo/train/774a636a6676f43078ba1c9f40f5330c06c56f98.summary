-- if @entity2 says same - sex marriage is inevitable , it 's inevitable			1
here 's what the conservative radio host had to say about the topic on a recent show : " this issue is lost			2
i do n't care what the @entity10 does			1
and it 's inevitable because we lost the language on this			1
" in a separate clip , he says he would agree with gay rights activists who claim the " genie is n't going to get put back in the bottle " on this issue			0
" i think the inertia is clearly moving in the direction that there is going to be gay marriage , at some point , nationwide			2
" does he sound begrudging ? yes			0
do i care ? no. if the @entity29 is endorsing the inevitability of same - sex marriage , then my generation -- the one demographers talk about when they mention the " sea change " in public opinion on this topic ; the people born after 1981 who support " gay marriage " at a rate of 70 % -- will live to see it happen			1
that 's so exciting that i almost want to end the column right here and now			2
who cares what the @entity10 decides ? @entity2 said equality is on the way ! but then the question becomes : how soon ? and : what happens until then ? finally : does n't this in - between part matter ? those doubts are what bother me about a new and hotly debated @entity54 cover that declares , quite prematurely , and in all - caps : " gay marriage already won			1
" " the @entity10 has n't made up its mind , " the subhead says , " but @entity59 has			1
" the trouble : @entity59 has n't			0
@entity63 - @entity59 , which voted in 2008 to ban same - sex marriage , could easily overturn that law if a new election were held today			1
@entity67 : gays live in 50 @entity69 but there are plenty of gay and lesbian people who live in states like @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 -- where far different views dominate the discourse			1
unless the @entity10 rules broadly against @entity63 's ban on same - sex marriage , which seems unlikely to the smart people who have been dissecting the arguments , then some gay people could be waiting decades for equal rights under the law			1
how long , exactly , is the subject of some debate			0
" in @entity93 - leaning red states , which uniformly have banned gay marriage , few seem to be having second thoughts , " writes @entity89 in the @entity90			2
" for the near future , the nation appears locked onto a trajectory in which almost all reliably blue states will establish gay marriage ( or civil unions ) and possibly not a single reliably red state will follow			2
i did find a glimmer of hope , however , in an analysis from @entity108 , the @entity109 blogger and data wiz who correctly predicted the outcome of the 2012 presidential election			0
@entity108 says even the reddest of the red states will change eventually			0
thirty - two states would support same - sex marriage in a popular vote by the year 2016 , he writes in a recent blog post			1
" and by 2020 , voters in 44 states would do so , assuming that same - sex marriage continues to gain support at roughly its previous rate			1
" the six states left out ? @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity77 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 , according to his analysis			0
i recently spent some time in that state , which passed a constitutional amendment banning same - sex marriage by a majority vote of 86 %			1
in states like that , gay people find it difficult in some communities just to exist , much less hold commitment ceremonies			0
i met gay kids who had been harassed at school ; a couple that keep a security camera on their porch ; and a man who says he was fired because of his sexual orientation			0
( that 's legal in @entity127 and 28 other states , by the way , and it 's something no one 's talking about			2
) opinion : which state matches your values on lgbt rights ? the conversation is changing -- there are plenty of proud , brave and openly gay people living in the @entity162 -- but it 's happening at an uneven clip			2
and these delays matter for real people			0
in @entity127 , i met folks like @entity167 and @entity168 , who are legally married in @entity169 but do n't get any of the rights that go with that partnership in the @entity172			0
they told me they would like to start a family but worry about both of them getting custody , since @entity127 bans adoption by same - sex parents			1
@entity168 , who would like to carry the child , is 31			0
if same - sex marriage is n't legalized until , say , 2030 , she would be 48			1
it would be nice to overlook this mushy , awkward middle period -- our county 's pimply adolescence on gay rights -- and jump straight to an all - inclusive future			1
but these teenage years matter			0
they affect how millions of @entity59 live today			0
and the transition could also affect what type of nation we become			0
let 's hope they go by quickly			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity67 .			2

@entity54 's cover declares " @entity200 "
@entity202 says that *assertion* is premature for most of the country
he says same - sex marriage is inevitable -- and that 's a great thing
@entity67 : if the @entity10 passes , it could be years before it 's national *policy*
