-- next week , the people of @entity2 will vote on whether to seek independence from the @entity4 , creating the world 's newest country in the process			1
recent polls suggest that this is by no means just a pipe dream of the @entity2 nationalists , with the " yes " campaign actually leading in one survey			1
but the results will be being watched far from @entity4 's shores ; this is a decision that has potentially far - reaching consequences , especially within @entity18			1
the referendum -- and the @entity4 's clear willingness to abide by the results -- is a rarity among the world 's independence movements			2
we 're much more used to hearing about low - level armed conflict and even all - out war among regions seeking to split from each other			0
one nation that has grappled with periodic separatist violence is @entity32 , which may well be the country that will see the most immediate impact of a vote			1
here , regional , historical and linguistic differences have spawned several strong separatist movements , and the @entity38 region plans its own referendum in november , despite @entity32 court rulings that the process will have no standing			1
a strong vote for secession in @entity38 would send a signal that a democracy can not afford to ignore and could be the first domino to fall			2
in @entity32 's @entity51 country , as it is known , a separatist movement headlined by the terrorist group @entity49 left hundreds dead before the organization abandoned violence in 2011 , but calls for independence have not died down in the same way the violence has			2
if @entity2 goes , expect the @entity57 , the @entity51 , the @entity58 and other @entity32 regions to make a renewed push to split from @entity61			1
disillusionment with central government has been compounded by the lengthy and painful @entity18 economic crisis ( although some argue smaller countries have typically fared worse in times of trouble ) , and many regions with an eye on independence lament that they are being shortchanged by their central governments			1
that is the case in northern @entity76 , a part of the country that is more prosperous than the rest and with a reputation for more disciplined work habits than southern regions			0
the @entity84 region , anchored in @entity85 , once the center of the powerful @entity85 , recently held its own unofficial online referendum			2
a majority said they want to split from @entity90			0
but at its core , the question of independence comes down to more than economics			2
it is about two related questions : what are nations and states ? and should the former always become the latter ? after all , nationhood is in many ways about cultural issues -- a shared language , a shared history -- while a state is essentially a political entity			0
with all this in mind , it is n't surprising that the case for independence is often , to a large degree , emotional , an appeal to nationalist sentiment as much as to politics and practicalities			0
and it is also often fostered by a sense of injustice or even exploitation			0
take the @entity124 separatist @entity125 , who wants his region to split from @entity128 and is passionately cheering the @entity2 on to statehood , arguing that independence fortifies democracy , because " the larger the political unit , the less chance individuals have of being heard			1
" some @entity133 might sympathize with the notion that bigger does not always mean better			0
the country is made up of the @entity137 - speaking walloons and the @entity139 - speaking @entity138 , but the @entity138 resent the outsize influence of @entity137 speakers			0
it is unsurprising , then , that calls to unravel the union emerge with regularity			0
these debates are taking place against a backdrop of a @entity18 where the entire notion of what being an independent country means is being debated , as individual states wrestle with how to define the role of the @entity154 , with its @entity156 - based bureaucracy , its vague and shifting foreign policy and economic powers and its distant links to the populations it is meant to represent			1
will @entity18 's evolution create a whole new type of entity , a semi-independent nation - state , which surrenders some of its autonomy to a much larger supranational union ? for now , the experiment is yielding mixed results , with financial crises undermining confidence in , and distracting from , discussions of greater integration			1
but with @entity176 's recent incursions into @entity177 , who knows how the debate will evolve ? ( @entity174 will argue that the @entity2 referendum is equivalent to @entity182 's vote to join @entity176 , although few outside @entity176 see things that way			1
) farther afield , in the @entity192 , boundaries that themselves are only several decades old are being erased by , among others , @entity190 even as the @entity186 people , spread across @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189 , push for their own state			0
( do n't expect any referendums here			0
such votes are more likely to remain the exception rather than the rule			0
) of course , in a tumultuous , violent world , it is encouraging in @entity2 's case to see peaceful , democratic means used to settle a contentious , high - stakes issue like the very existence of a nation			2
but if @entity2 really do decide to vote for independence , it is hard not to see it triggering a wave of separatist tension in @entity18 and beyond .			1

@entity2 will vote in a referendum next week on whether to become independent
decision could have huge consequences , especially within @entity18 , says @entity215
@entity215 : @entity217 comes down to more than economics
@entity2 " yes " vote could trigger a wave of separatist tension in @entity18 and beyond , @entity215 says
