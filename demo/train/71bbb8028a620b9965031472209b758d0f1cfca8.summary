-- the loss of native tropical forests accounts for more than 10 % of the carbon emissions responsible for the changing climate , receiving much - deserved attention at the recent @entity7 climate change conference in @entity8			1
when forests are cleared and burned , the carbon contained in the trees and other vegetation -- roughly half of their dry weight -- is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas contributing to global warming			1
most of the carbon dioxide emissions caused by human activity come from fossil fuels			1
but native tropical forests average about 150 tons of carbon per hectare , and millions of hectares are cleared and burned every year			1
over the past decade , governments and industry have responded to growing pressure to reverse deforestation , sometimes committing to reducing it to zero			1
but with few exceptions , we 've lacked the tools to assess accountability			0
this changed when @entity36 published a groundbreaking analysis of annual deforestation on the entire planet between 2000 and 2012			1
with the help of @entity44 and using advanced computing techniques , @entity41 professor @entity40 and his colleagues analyzed unprecedented amounts of satellite imagery at a 30 - meter scale			0
their work allows anyone with a computer , tablet or smartphone and a decent internet connection to see clearly where the world 's forests are growing and where they are being destroyed			2
go to @entity60 and click on different regions			0
use the pulldown menu to see the state of forests all over the world from 2000 to 2012 , using several measurements			2
go to the damage locations like the swath of the @entity74 tornado , @entity68 forest fires , palm oil plantations in @entity70 , and many more			0
distant regions are close at hand , the range of forests becomes easy to grasp , and the speed at which many of the forests are vanishing grows far more difficult to ignore			1
more than 60 governments have signed on to the @entity84 's pledge to achieve " zero net deforestation " by 2020			2
the pledge specifically excludes offsetting native forest loss with tree plantations , although regrowing forests on abandoned lands can be subtracted from any " gross " deforestation			1
with the new digitized maps and data available online , civil society watchdogs can and should hold governments accountable for making progress toward their targets			1
similar zero - deforestation pledges have been made by corporate leaders , including the board of the @entity101 , a mammoth private sector consortium that includes hundreds of companies with combined revenues of more than $ 3 trillion annually			1
most tropical deforestation is driven by growing global demand for agricultural commodities like beef , soya , palm oil and paper			1
members of the consortium have promised to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains for those products			2
ensuring the transparent flow of information from analyses like the one published in @entity36 last week will be essential to keeping the private sector accountable			2
it is now possible to track what 's happening in the remote regions of @entity123 , @entity124 or @entity125 ( @entity126 ) or in the forests of the @entity128			1
for the past 25 years , we 've had this kind of data only for the @entity123 @entity132			0
every year when the @entity133 releases its numbers , scrutiny ensues in @entity123 and internationally			0
few governments have possessed the combination of information and candor about their forests that the @entity123 have exhibited for the @entity132			2
and until 2012 , as reported in @entity36 , the trend had been looking good in @entity123			0
but on the same as this new report in @entity36 was published , the @entity123 government announced dispiriting news from the sidelines of @entity7 climate talks in @entity8 : deforestation in the @entity149 nation had reached 5,843 square kilometers ( 2,256 square miles ) between august 1 , 2012 , and july 31 , 2013 , up from 4,751 a year ago			2
environment minister @entity150 called this increase unacceptable and said the government would not tolerate any rise in illegal deforestation , calling it a crime			2
already , the issue has become fodder for next year 's presidential election			0
@entity159 and @entity123 president @entity160 are accountable to their national climate change policy , passed by the @entity123 @entity163 in 2009			0
that law included a target for reducing @entity132 deforestation to 3,900 square kilometers by 2020 , an 80 % drop from the average rate of forest loss from 1996 to 2005			1
many developing countries simply lack sufficient knowledge of their forests , and many use questionable accounting practices			1
in @entity124 , the @entity175 has insisted that no deforestation happens when plantations for pulp and paper production replace native forests			1
following that logic , you could completely replace some of the most biodiverse , carbon - rich ecosystems on @entity183 with monoculture acacia farms and brand them as " zero - deforestation			1
" when we say that knowledge is power , we mean that people with access to knowledge have power and those without it are powerless			0
transparency is the democratization of that critical access			0
without it , governments and corporations are unaccountable			0
overall , @entity40 and his colleagues report that the deforestation trend in the tropics is worsening			0
@entity123 's success at reducing forest loss through 2012 was more than offset by increased losses in @entity124 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 and elsewhere			0
these and other results and their interpretations will surely be scrutinized and may be improved upon , because they are freely accessible in digital form			0
while government and corporate leaders increasingly profess the virtues of transparency and accountability , the translation of their words into practice has often lagged			0
but with our new access to digital information , gaps between words and deeds can and should be quickly exposed , even in the most remote regions of the planet			0
this is good news for all of us concerned about the forests , the people who depend on them and global climate change			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity240 .			1

@entity242 : loss of native tropical forests accounts for 10 % of carbon emissions
@entity240 : we have never been able to track how much and where trees are disappearing
@entity251 : a new online *interactive* shows exactly where forests are vanishing and how fast
countries now can be held accountable , he says , for " zero deforestation " pledges
