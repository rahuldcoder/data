-- @entity1 have confirmed that absent @entity3 striker @entity2 will be back in time for the @entity6 side 's return to training next week			1
@entity2 had a reputation for partying prior to his @entity10 - record transfer to @entity1 last august			1
city manager @entity11 told the club 's official web site that @entity2 , who cost mega-rich @entity1 a @entity10 record fee of Â£ 32.5 million ( $ 45m ) when he signed from @entity15 in august , will be spoken to after not joining the rest of the squad in a @entity19 training camp this week -- choosing instead to fly to @entity20 to attend to a family matter			1
@entity11 told mcfc.co.uk : " @entity24 left without permission , he felt that he had personal things that he needed to attend to			1
" he made the decision to leave the camp , and go back to @entity20			2
that was not with my permission , and the situation at the moment is not really practical to get him back here with time differences and length of flights , so he will be back at the weekend ready to train when we are back in @entity38 at the first available opportunity			2
" once he is back , i will sit down with him and explain my feelings , and decisions will be made after that			0
he has rung me , and he understands that we need to address this -- and we will			0
then we will move on			0
@entity2 's decision to fly to @entity20 came on the same day that @entity1 announced they were pulling out of a world record transfer move for @entity47 star @entity46 , a @entity3 team - mate of @entity2			1
@entity11 has insisted that that two matters are completely unrelated			2
@entity2 is no stranger to controversy and had a reputation as a party - goer prior to his move to @entity38 last year			0
he was dropped by his former @entity15 coach , and now @entity55 national coach , @entity54 , who questioned his attitude and @entity2 's eventual departure from the @entity59 club was acrimonious			0
in fact , in october 2007 , @entity2 failed to return to @entity15 after appearing for @entity20 in an international match , claiming he had missed his flight			1
local newspapers later revealed that he had been seen partying in a popular @entity65 nightclub and he was subsequently fined and dropped by the club .			0

@entity2 will return to @entity1 in time for return to training next week
city manager @entity11 reveals @entity2 flew to @entity20 without permission
however , @entity11 says their failure to sign @entity46 was not linked to his decision
