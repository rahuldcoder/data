-- on a recent trip to @entity3 as part of a delegation of @entity9 - @entity8 and @entity10 @entity7 leaders , i heard a joke that is circulating among the intelligentsia : " @entity9 are observing daylight savings time in a major way			1
on december 1 , they 'll turn the clocks back 100 years			0
" actually , it 's not quite a century			0
the reference seems to be to 1929 , when the @entity19 ( or an earlier version of it ) kicked off what would be a 71 - year hold on the presidency			1
in the 20th century , @entity19 became notorious for the brutality , corruption , election rigging , and brazen thievery of its leaders and their cronies			2
now , after 12 years out of power , the @entity19 is returning to the scene of its crimes			2
the party is about to retake the reins of power thanks , in large measure , to the popular appeal of a handsome , charismatic and personable 46 - year - old lawyer who seems to have stepped right out of central casting			0
he is even married to a beautiful telenovela actress			0
@entity42 is set to take office on december 1			0
@entity9 feeling persecuted flee @entity10 this has been a @entity46 ending for a political party that was , just a few years ago , on the brink of extinction			1
the first blow came in 2000 when the @entity52 's @entity51 broke the @entity19 's hold on the presidency			1
then came heavy losses for the @entity19 in @entity56 during the 2003 midterm elections			0
that was followed by another victory for the @entity52 in 2006 , when @entity60 took the presidency -- and the @entity19 candidate came in last among the top three political parties			2
but then , the @entity19 regained some ground in the 2009 midterm elections -- in part , it seems , because the @entity9 public was so battle - weary after three years of @entity60 's bloody war against the drug cartels			1
do n't get me wrong			0
the drug war is messy but necessary , and that 's true in both the @entity10 and @entity3			1
legalizing drugs and making them more readily available would , in either country , increase the number of addicts , lead to more street crime to feed consumption habits , destroy scores of families , make people less productive and more dependent , and empower criminals by surrendering the fight			0
opinion : @entity3 , @entity10 ties ripe for major expansion and yet , it all comes at a high cost			0
south of the border , the drug war has resulted in the deaths of more than 50,000 @entity9			1
and , because it has become more difficult to move drugs to the @entity10 and @entity95 , it has brought to @entity9 society a domestic drug consumption problem that @entity9 have long been content to export to the @entity10			2
even the man who started the war -- or , as @entity9 like to say , stirred the hornet 's nest -- now claims that it 's not winnable			1
@entity60 , the outgoing president of @entity3 , recently conceded in an interview with @entity104 that ending the consumption of drugs and drug trafficking is " impossible			2
" as @entity60 sees it , the real goal of the drug war is to disrupt the drug trade and keep money out of the hands of killers who terrorize the @entity9 people			1
those people are now taking another look at the @entity19			2
the way they see it , the party may have been corrupt , but at least it was competent			0
unlike the @entity52 , whose leaders seem obsessed with causes and crusades -- for @entity125 , defending @entity9 immigrants in the @entity10 , and for @entity60 , the drug war -- the @entity19 kept the trains running on time			1
can @entity130 a @entity42 save @entity3 ? as many @entity9 see it , the country needs to move on to other business			1
they expect @entity42 to lead the way			0
they may not want a complete and unconditional surrender to the drug cartels , but they could live with an accommodation that included an end to the violence			0
the battle against the drug cartels is sure to be on the agenda tuesday when @entity42 is scheduled to visit the @entity146 and meet with president @entity147			1
i had the chance to meet @entity42 during my trip and hear about his vision for building a new and improved @entity3			2
despite the knocks that he has taken from the @entity9 press and the elites for not appearing to be book - smart , he has more than his share of " eq " -- emotional intelligence			0
this will carry him far with a @entity9 public that , at this point , wants to have leaders that it can relate to , who will address its everyday concerns			0
@entity3 's misconceptions like a certain recent @entity10 president from @entity168 , @entity42 is taken lightly by many as he enters the office			1
yet sometimes being underestimated can be helpful			0
and just as @entity171 reached the height of his popularity after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , @entity42 might yet surprise his critics and rise to the challenge of dealing with a major crisis when faced with one			0
in his meeting with @entity147 , the @entity9 president - elect is likely to dwell on what he believes the @entity10 can accomplish for @entity3			1
this will probably include delivering the last few hundred million dollars worth of equipment and supplies that is owed to @entity3 to help it fight the drug cartels under the $ 1.4 billion @entity186 ; safeguarding the rights of @entity9 immigrants in the @entity10 regardless of legal status ; and supporting the creation of a @entity8 trade alliance ( the @entity10 , @entity3 and @entity95 ) that could compete with @entity192 and the @entity193 on the stage of global commerce			1
but @entity42 should also focus on what @entity3 can accomplish for the @entity10			2
he could pledge to continue the drug war and keep the pressure on the cartels , in the spirit of the @entity186 ; vow to create more jobs and better - paying jobs in @entity3 , especially in the poorest regions that produce most of the illegal immigrants to the @entity10 ; commit himself to addressing the severe inequalities between @entity9 , closing the huge gap between rich and poor , and expanding the middle class in a country where more than 50 % of the population still lives in poverty ; and pledge to open up the @entity9 petroleum industry to investment from @entity8 and partnerships with @entity8 and @entity95 oil companies			1
@entity216 's challenge all of this would benefit not only the relationship between @entity3 and the @entity10 , but also the lives of @entity9			1
those people seem to be tired of crusades			2
now , it appears that they want their leaders to focus on the basics : creating better - paying jobs , protecting the population , expanding trade , improving access to technology , developing infrastructure in rural areas , and improving relations with foreign countries and trade partners			0
those are some of the challenges facing @entity42			0
how he addresses them will tell us whether the @entity9 people who elected him , and returned his party to power , made a wise choice or a bad mistake			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity247 .			0

@entity3 's *incoming* president @entity42 meets with @entity147 on tuesday

@entity9 people are tired of crusades such as drug war , want a return to basics , he says
@entity247 : @entity147 , @entity42 have opportunity to help each other and their nations
