-- it 's football season : from @entity3 , @entity4 and other children 's football leagues ; from high school to college and the pros , football is the name of the game			1
unfortunately , it 's also a time when we see sports - related concussions , particularly among children			1
this year , there will be millions of sports - related concussions and many of them will go undiagnosed			1
around 300,000 will result in a player losing consciousness			0
research indicates that multiple concussions may lead to dementia and lasting brain damage , and more concussions happen in football than in other sport			1
the result is a brain injury epidemic that affects 4.5 million players who are still too young to play in the @entity33			1
@entity34 is a tough sport , but the concussion epidemic is a problem we can work to fix			0
part of the issue is the culture of the game			0
retired @entity33 great @entity43 , the all - time leading scorer for the @entity44 and one of the greatest kickers to play the game , wrote to me about his experiences			2
" when i played football , suffering a concussion was often shrugged off as merely having your ' bell rung , ' " @entity43 wrote			2
" my teammates had no shortage of toughness and wanted to build the mentality to out - tough our opponents			2
we now know that multiple concussions can lead to lasting brain damage and should be treated as a serious matter			1
" the good news is that concussions are being treated as a serious matter , more and more			1
@entity65 is one of several states with a sports concussion law			2
it requires that coaches be trained about concussions and brain injuries , and that students who suffer concussions must stay on the sidelines for at least a week , and until a medical professional approves his or her return to play			0
but coaching is not the only way to approach the problem			0
when kids step onto the field , they need to be confident that their safety equipment will provide adequate protection			0
far too often it does n't keep the young athlete as safe as it should			0
although football helmet safety has improved since the days of leather helmets , today 's voluntary football helmet safety standards do n't take our modern understanding of concussion risks into account			1
for example , the industry standard primarily protects against serious injury from a severe , direct blow â € ” but it does not address the risk of a concussion caused by less severe impacts , or by hits that spin the head and brain			0
the standard for reconditioning used football helmets also does not specify how often these old helmets must be recertified			1
one young student - athlete , @entity111 , returned to play too soon after suffering a concussion			1
@entity111 was wearing a 20 - year - old helmet when he suffered another concussion that led to brain damage			1
his parents wrote me asking , " how is it possible that our son was issued a helmet three years older than he was ? " unfortunately , about 100,000 helmets out there are more than a decade old			0
these helmets are on the heads of high school and younger football players across the country this season			1
as knowledge of head injuries improves , some companies advertise newer helmets with sweeping safety claims			2
young athletes could put themselves at greater risk if they think a new " anti-concussion " helmet , headband , or mouth guard makes them invulnerable to brain injury			0
we can do better than this			0
parents should be able to let their kids play football confident that the equipment they 're using has been created with the best science and technology for protection of injury			0
that 's why i introduced the @entity153			0
this bipartisan legislation , which has been endorsed by the @entity155 , would help ensure that new and reconditioned football helmets for high school and younger players meet safety standards that specifically address concussion risk and the needs of young athletes			1
the bill also increases potential penalties for using false injury prevention claims to sell helmets or any other children 's sports equipment			1
there will always be some risk of injury in football â € ” it 's inevitably part of the game			2
but , we must make sure that athletes , coaches and parents know about the dangers and signs of concussion ; we must make sure that they are using safe equipment ; and we must take any false advertising out of the game			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of sen. @entity187 .			2

@entity187 : millions of sports - related concussions a year ; most happen in football
concussions are a serious matter , @entity192 writes ; 4.5 milion young players are affected
@entity187 : younger players need football helmets with up - to - date safety standards
@entity187 's legislation would set standards for new and reconditioned football helmets
