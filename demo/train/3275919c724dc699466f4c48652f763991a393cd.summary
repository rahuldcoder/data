-- the world changes , but i 'm not sure it 's supposed to change this much : @entity4 is on @entity5			1
" yeah , " @entity4 said the other day , " i 'm on it			1
people told me that 's the way to connect with people			2
" @entity11 on a social network ... something just seems wrong			1
he always seemed to be the most anti-social human being on the face of the @entity15			2
at least he did from the vantage point of the third row on saturday afternoons during the 1950s , which is where i always sat when i watched him work			2
i was 9 , and my friend @entity20 and i would ride the bus to @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 , where , for 50 cents , we purchased tickets to observe in person a weekly television broadcast called " @entity29			1
" @entity30 , a highly excitable local @entity31 dealer , was the sponsor and host , and @entity11 was the ultimate scowling villain			1
he did terrible things to his opponents			2
the hero of the telecasts was the blond , golden @entity36			2
in most of the country , he was promoted as a bad guy , but for whatever reason , in central @entity24 , @entity36 was as beloved as @entity41			2
nature boy could do no wrong			0
" do n't even say that name to me , " @entity4 told me the other day			1
he is 82 now , and we were talking over a telephone line , but i instantly obeyed			0
" i hated @entity42 's guts offstage as well as on , " @entity4 said			1
" do n't bring him up again			0
" as it was , i could scarcely believe i was even talking to @entity4 ; it had been more than 50 years since those afternoons at @entity22 , with people screaming vile invective at him as he stepped between the ropes and into the ring , staring daggers at the audience and wearing a leather , military - type jacket			1
out of curiosity this month i had decided to try to find out if he was still alive , and here he was , on the phone from his home in @entity63 , sounding quite pleasant			0
so , @entity4 ... why do you think people hated you so much ? " fans never did like me from day one , and i never knew why , " he said			1
" i was a good - looking young kid when i was first getting started , and they put me in the ring against a bunch of ugly , hairy guys , and yet i was the one who got booed			1
the promoters said to me , ' you know , nobody likes you			0
' " biting the inside of my mouth , not knowing whether i should offer an opinion , i said : " perhaps it had something to do with your name being @entity11 ? " " yeah , i guess so , " @entity4 said			1
" but i did n't give myself that name			0
a promoter in @entity84 did			1
" in the years after @entity88 , the most certain way to turn fans against a wrestler was to give him a @entity91 or @entity92 name			2
wartime wounds were still raw			0
" i was n't even of @entity91 heritage , " @entity4 said			1
" i was born in @entity95 to an @entity98 - @entity97 family			0
" ( in case you 're wondering what @entity4 's name was as a boy : i asked him , and he said he did n't feel like discussing it			1
do you want to be the one to tell @entity4 to do something he does n't feel like doing ? be my guest			1
) " when i first started wrestling professionally , i was billed as @entity108 , " he said			2
" but i guess that did n't sound like a bad - enough villain			0
so they changed it to @entity11			1
" made a certain sense , in the context of the times -- @entity116 , one of @entity118 's henchmen , was not exactly a beloved figure in a 1950s @entity97 filled with returning servicemen			0
" they told me , ' you 're @entity11 now , ' and my attitude was , ' @entity124 , if you say so			1
' " he had never been outside the @entity97 , but ring announcers from coast to coast proclaimed that he was " from @entity129 , @entity91 , " or " from @entity130 , @entity91 , " or " from @entity131 , @entity91 " ( they seemed to make it up as they went along ) , and thus he was able to make a pretty good living			0
although it did have its downside			0
" i was wrestling one night in @entity134 , @entity24 , " he said			2
the fans found where i had parked my car on the street and smashed it to pieces			1
they knocked out all the windows , banged the fenders , cut the tires			0
i had no idea until after the match			0
" " so what did you do ? " i asked			0
" @entity30 had the car towed to his dealership , and he fixed it up , which was a nice thing for him to do seeing that he had a @entity31 dealership and i drove an @entity153			2
" there were no pensions for the professional wrestlers of his day , so when he got too old for the job he found work as a truck driver , and for a while , perhaps inspired by @entity30 , he sold cars			1
( although it is difficult to imagine how , after spending a career persuading people to despise him , he could beckon them to purchase an auto from " your friendly neighborhood used - car dealer , @entity11			1
" ) he always seemed like a loner , but he told me that if there had been @entity5 when he was competing , he would have accepted just about all of his fellow wrestlers , heroes or heels , as friends			1
every name i threw at him -- all of the men who , when i was a boy , i witnessed sharing a " @entity29 " ring with him -- he said yes to			0
" @entity180 ? " yes			0
" @entity181 ? " yes			0
" @entity182 ? " yes			0
" handsome @entity183 ? " yes			0
" the @entity184 ? " yes			0
" i had to say it : " @entity187 ? " " absolutely not			0
not in a million years			0
" in retirement and heading toward his 83rd birthday , @entity4 said he does not miss the mayhem that once defined his life			1
and when he does find himself in the mood for unsuppressed anger , bellicose posturing and high - decibel insults , he knows where to turn			0
" i watch cable news , " he said			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			1

@entity200 says he found a wrestler he used to watch as a kid on @entity5
he says @entity11 was scary , *reviled* , partly because of name promoter gave him
@entity200 *interviewed* the retiree , who was truck driver , car *salesman* after he left wrestling
@entity200 : now @entity4 says he *'d* *happily* friend his former wrestling rivals on @entity5
