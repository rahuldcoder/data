the @entity0 have taken control of @entity3 , and with it ownership of health care reform			1
as long as the @entity0 were in opposition , they could just complain			2
and they did , voting repeatedly — and futily — to repeal the @entity10			0
now , they are coming up with actual reform ideas			0
their first reform proposal — to redefine full - time employment as 40 hours a week under the @entity10 — may be emblematic of what is to come			1
the idea is favored by business groups that support the @entity0 financially			2
but such a change would increase the number of uninsured and raise the federal budget deficit by $ 53 billion over the next 10 years			0
currently , full - time employment is defined as 30 hours per week , and under the health care law , large companies must offer health insurance to those working full time			1
most @entity30 workers now work close to 40 hours a week and are insured			1
but under the @entity0 proposal , employers could send employees home a half - hour early on friday and drop their coverage			1
the @entity35 estimates this change could " lead employers to make changes that would affect many more workers than will be affected under current law " as well as cause a million @entity30 workers to lose their employer - sponsored health insurance			1
nearly five years after its enactment , the @entity10 remains unpopular , despite the fact that many of its reforms — ending pre-existing condition exclusions , covering adult children to age 26 , and closing the @entity50 drug doughnut hole — are very popular			0
the @entity10 has also been remarkably successful in achieving its goals			0
both the percentage of @entity30 who are uninsured and the rate of growth in health care spending are at historic lows			1
@entity0 continue to talk repeal , but actual repeal would at this point be disruptive			2
one of the great virtues of the @entity10 is that it has managed to extend coverage significantly without disrupting the three primary forms of coverage enjoyed by most @entity30			2
nearly half of @entity30 are insured through their employment , while @entity50 and @entity68 each cover another sixth			1
the @entity10 has expanded benefits for employed @entity30 by requiring coverage for preventive services and capping out - of - pocket expenditures			1
employer - sponsored enrollment has remained largely stable under the @entity10 , while @entity50 and @entity68 enrollment have grown			0
premiums for employer coverage and for @entity50 have increased more slowly than in previous years			0
@entity0 reform proposals , on the other hand , take aim squarely at the most widespread forms of coverage			2
conservatives have long called for an end to the tax exclusions that have helped to make employer coverage nearly universal in the @entity30			2
they would not eliminate them entirely , rather replacing provisions that currently exempt employer - sponsored coverage from income and payroll taxes with capped deductions and exclusions			0
for many employees this will result immediately in higher taxes or premiums			0
moreover , @entity3 is unlikely to adjust the fixed dollar subsidies to keep pace with health care inflation , so excess cost increases will simply be shifted — dollar for dollar — to employees			1
republicans also have long proposed shifting @entity50 to a premium support program			0
seniors and the disabled would no longer be able to count on a guaranteed benefit , but would be given a fixed government contribution and have to shop for their own coverage			0
@entity0 propose turning @entity68 into a block grant program , shifting to the states responsibility for bearing the increasing costs of the program			2
one of the most problematic features of @entity10 coverage is the high deductibles and co-insurance that come with many marketplace plans for those whose incomes are too high to qualify them for cost - sharing reduction payments			0
but conservatives have supported high cost - sharing , and @entity0 proposals to repeal the @entity10 would wipe out the out - of - pocket expenditure caps it imposes			1
@entity0 support generous tax subsidies for health savings accounts to help cover cost sharing , but @entity131 only benefit those wealthy enough to put savings aside , and particularly those in high tax brackets			1
of course , any legislation that would undermine health coverage for @entity30 will have to survive a filibuster in the @entity139 and a veto from president @entity141			1
@entity0 believe they now have a trump card : @entity143 v. @entity144 , the case the @entity146 will decide this summer			2
plaintiffs in @entity143 ask the court to read a few words of the @entity10 out of context to deprive millions of @entity30 of the help they are now receiving through the federal marketplaces			0
@entity3 could easily clarify the meaning of these words through the kind of technical amendments that @entity157 have always adopted after major legislation			0
@entity10 opponents , however , are encouraging @entity3 to use a potential adverse @entity146 decision to push through much broader changes			0
notice that @entity0 are not promising if you like the coverage you have now you can keep it , whether you are covered by employer - sponsored coverage , @entity50 or @entity68 .			1

now that @entity0 has control of @entity3 , they are proposing reforms to health law
their plan to redefine full - time employment as 40 hours a week would hurt @entity30
