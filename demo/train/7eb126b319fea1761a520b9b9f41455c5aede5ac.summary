-- paint , wine and noodles -- three things which wo n't help @entity5 on the football pitch , but are helping swell the club 's bank balance			1
while @entity10 's team lost its opening @entity12 game of the 2013 - 14 season to @entity14 , some consolation for @entity5 is being provided by its innovative sponsorship deals and partnerships with companies around the globe			1
the @entity22 team 's strategy of capitalizing on its worldwide appeal by targeting localized sponsorships and partnerships has generated $ 42.6 million ( â ‚ ¬ 32m ) across 38 separate deals			2
it 's a strategy that began six years ago when @entity5 signed a deal with @entity31 's @entity30 vodka brand as its " responsible drinking partner " in @entity33			1
in @entity35 , @entity34 is its official telecommunications partner , while in @entity37 it 's @entity38 -- and the list is growing			0
@entity5 is now generating over 350 % more revenue through these type of deals than its nearest challenger @entity44 , according to a report published by sports market research company @entity46 , though in comparison to television revenue the income from these deals is still relatively small			1
having started in the 2013 - 2014 season , the @entity12 's current three - year television deal is worth $ 9.4 billion -- $ 5.7 billion for domestic rights , the rest for overseas			0
by way of comparison 84 localized sponsorship deals accounted for over â ‚ ¬ 54m ( $ 72m ) in income for 20 top @entity58 clubs in the 2013 - 14 season			1
even so , other top clubs are upping their game , with @entity44 appointing @entity61 as its official beer in @entity63 , while @entity5 's archrival @entity64 has @entity65 ! as official betting partner in @entity67			1
@entity5 's neighbor @entity69 , recently sanctioned by @entity70 for breaching @entity72 rules , is acutely aware of the need to raise additional sponsorship income and did six deals -- including one with @entity76 as its official debit card partner in @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			1
" whilst broadcast rights remain the biggest income stream for clubs in @entity70 , commercial activities are the second largest contributor , accounting for 29 % of all revenues made			0
identifying new ways to increase the value of these deals is incredibly important , " @entity46 's football expert @entity87 told @entity0			0
@entity5 's efforts to capitalize on its global following gathered pace after the late @entity94 and his family took control of the club in 2005			1
the @entity98 , who already owned an @entity100 franchise , quickly realized the potential for established brands to become associated with the success of the @entity12 club under former manager @entity105			0
back then , most clubs ' principal sponsor had its name emblazoned across the teams ' strip , and it remains a key source of income			0
@entity113 will be paying @entity5 $ 80 million per season for seven years to have the @entity115 logo displayed on the kit , but the marketing operation now extends across some unlikely areas			2
@entity119 is @entity5 's official wine , there 's an official medical partner -- @entity123 -- and even an official noodle partner , @entity125			2
underneath these overarching global deals come the local and regional partners , with the @entity33 the most fertile			1
but other territories offer great potential for further exploitation , and the growing popularity of football in @entity133 is a case in point			0
" markets such as the @entity138 pose as a great opportunity for these clubs too in developing this trend , as leagues such as the @entity12 become more influential in @entity133 , " said @entity136			0
@entity144 marketeers are also keeping in touch with the latest developments in social media , where individual fan loyalty can be tapped , again with a local offer			0
" increasingly , companies are focusing more on the individual consumer , not just a general population , tailoring products and services to better suit the end user , " added @entity136			0
" the trend we are seeing with @entity70 's top football clubs illustrates that perfectly through the way they segment their commercial assets for specific , localized markets and in turn , that market 's fan base			2
" but for the strategy to be fully exploited , it 's necessary for the clubs to achieve success on the pitch , so for @entity5 the season ahead under @entity10 is crucial			1
@entity173 ' reign was abruptly cut short by the @entity98 as results failed to meet expectation , with @entity5 finishing seventh in the @entity12 and failing to win a trophy other than the preseason @entity179			2
@entity180 is charged with restoring the club 's fortunes to ensure the cash keeps coming in from commercial activities but will also be hoping that his transfer budget reflects that continuing success story			2
so as @entity5 looks to raise funds for player purchases , it wo n't stop at noodles and wine .			0

@entity5 leads the way in localized sponsorship deals
club dominates this market with @entity33 its strongest
other clubs such as @entity44 stepping up activity in this area
@entity5 hopes @entity10 can restore its fortunes
