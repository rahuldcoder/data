-- @entity3 's @entity2 attorney general on monday appealed a judge 's decision to halt the enactment of a controversial new law that curbs the collective bargaining rights of most state employees			1
attorney general @entity10 is asking the state 's 4th @entity11 to lift the temporary restraining order handed down friday by @entity15 circuit court judge @entity14			1
@entity14 issued the injunction in response to a suit filed by a @entity20 district attorney alleging that @entity2 legislators violated the state 's open meetings law by calling a committee meeting to amend @entity2 gov. @entity26 's budget bill without providing the public 24 - hour advance notice			1
the amended bill , which had been stalled for weeks by 14 @entity20 state senators who left @entity3 to prevent a quorum -- and thus a vote on the measure -- then sailed to easy passage in both chambers of the @entity35			2
in the appeal , @entity10 argues that @entity14 has no jurisdiction over state lawmakers or @entity3 's secretary of state , all of whom have sovereign immunity			1
@entity14 's order bars @entity3 secretary of state @entity44 from publishing the new law			2
" the ( @entity3 ) @entity46 has repeatedly held that a court may not void any act of the @entity35 for alleged failure to follow a non-constitutional rule of legislative process , " @entity10 's brief states			2
" as applied to legislative acts , the @entity54 law is such a rule of process			0
" in a separate news release , @entity10 said , " the court may not interfere with the legislative process and enjoin the publication of a bill as the last step in the legislative process			0
... courts may only evaluate whether constitutional procedural requirements were met			0
" the public brouhaha over @entity26 's $ 137 million budget repair bill all but shut down the @entity3 state legislature for weeks			0
it also drew protesters by the tens of thousands , among them union supporters and public employees , who called the proposed measure an attack on workers			0
@entity2 lawmakers countered that the law will help the state close a massive budget shortfall with a plan that requires public workers , with the exception of police and firefighters , to cover more of their retirement plan contributions and health care premiums			1
@entity2 members of a conference committee on @entity26 's bill called a meeting march 9 to amend the bill			1
over the objections of a @entity20 @entity96 member , the lawmakers carved the governor 's proposed curbs on collective bargaining out of @entity26 's budget legislation and passed them in a separate bill			1
that enabled @entity2 to pass the bill out of the @entity104 with fewer votes			2
the state @entity96 then easily passed the bill			0
@entity26 signed it into law on march 11			0
five days later , @entity15 district attorney @entity110 , a @entity111 appointed last year by then - gov. @entity112 , also a @entity111 , filed suit .			0

@entity2 attorney general files appeal to void judge 's delay
the *official* says the judge has no jurisdiction over lawmakers
@entity124 contend that the bill 's passage violated open meetings law
