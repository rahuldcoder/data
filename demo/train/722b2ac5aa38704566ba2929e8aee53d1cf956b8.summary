-- just because you watch " @entity4 " or -- worse -- were a member of the @entity3 does n't mean you really know what it 's like to be a lifeguard			1
to find out , we went to the source : a veteran whistle - blower at a @entity12 beach			1
enjoy your swimming ! the money is terrible lifeguard season is about four months long , from mid-may to september			1
first - year guards make about $ 10 an hour -- not much -- and we pay a lot of money to live in a house down on the shore			0
but it 's the summertime -- you got ta enjoy it			1
we work hard we actually work a lot harder than most people think			0
i 've done more than 60 rescues now , in six years			0
sometimes , a group of 30 or more people will all get swept out by a riptide at once			0
i can bring in five people at a time , if i have a buoy , and two people if i do n't			0
and i can get 10 to 15 guards to come help me within a minute or two			0
i 've only lost two people , and they were swimming after hours			0
it was the worst riptide i 'd ever seen			0
@entity0 : 10 affordable beachfront resorts hot or not ? we talk about everybody on the beach of course we talk about everybody on the beach -- any flaw in any person			1
we buy our own walkie - talkie radios and communicate that way , about hot girls and everyone else who 's not so hot			1
we always get these big , old @entity49 - @entity48 guys who wear tiny thongs			0
it 's a long day sitting in the chair			1
you have to entertain yourself			0
you do n't want to know where we go to the bathroom we pee in the water just like everybody else -- some of the guards even go no. 2 in there			1
it 's quicker than walking up to the bathrooms on the boardwalk			1
but we do n't always want to get wet , so most of us pee without even leaving our chair			1
there 's a technique to it			1
you know how most guards wear sweatpants ? that 's because it 's easier to hide a @entity75 bottle in sweats than in shorts			2
you just stick the bottle down there and pee in it			2
we party hard we lifeguards have this motto : @entity83 , or alive ' @entity82			2
it 's our goal for the night			2
we get off of work at 5:30 p.m. then we usually drink at the house before heading to the bars at 1 a.m. after they close , we go home around 3:30 a.m. and drink a few cases of beer until 5 a.m. i 'm an old man of 24 now , so i usually fall asleep by 3 a.m. -- and i always get heckled for it			0
@entity0 : confessions of ... a cruise ship musician some lifeguards sleep on the job @entity99 party , but i 'm a total worrywart , and i take my job seriously ; no matter how hard i go out the night before , i 'm always at work when our day officially starts , at 9:30 a.m. i never fall asleep on the job , especially with all the caffeine and tobacco in my system			1
but i know guys who will sleep for five hours straight up in the chair			2
some will roll a towel up , wrap it around their neck , and then tuck the ends between their legs to keep themselves from falling out of the chair			0
others will wear a big sweatshirt and then hide an apple or orange under their chin , so it looks like they 're looking straight ahead at the water			2
sex on the beach -- it happens more than you might think i have to break up a lot of fights , mostly high school kids			2
no one 's allowed to drink on the beach , but everyone does -- even the lifeguards on their days off			1
and , of course , it 's illegal to have sex on the beach , but i always catch people doing it in the water			1
to be frank , i know a few lifeguards who have			2
but i always blow the whistle and put a stop to it , not just because it 's illegal			0
it 's a decency thing			0
