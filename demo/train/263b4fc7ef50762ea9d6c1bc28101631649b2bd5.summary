-- when out on the playground , there arose such a clatter -- because little @entity4 told all his classmates there was no such thing as @entity9			1
it 's an uncomfortable scenario both the @entity11 and @entity12 know all too well , and has the potential to leave parents caught like reindeer in headlights			1
it typically involves distraught kids cornering their parents after school with widened eyes , blurting out : " @entity4 told me there is n't a @entity9 ! " ( or @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity9 or @entity26 , respectively )			1
@entity27 knows the awkward affair all too well ; her own child recently told a number of the kids in kindergarten that @entity9 did n't exist			1
for spiritual reasons , @entity27 's family forgoes the @entity9 tradition			1
" one parent , whom i was friendly with , told me that her daughter was not allowed to play with my daughter anymore , " says @entity27			1
" she questioned my parenting skills and said in a very angry voice , ' i do not know what you are teaching your children in your house			1
but , we believe in @entity9 and fairies			1
your daughter took away something very special from my family			0
' " @entity27 , a catholic school teacher , has since advised her children not to " out " the jolly bearded man ; to let others believe if they 're so inclined			2
" note that the kid is not trying to be mean , but just ahead of the others in development of this concept , " says @entity53 , parenting coach , former school psychologist and author of " the pocket coach for parents			2
" " kids talk about what 's going on inside , which is natural for them , " @entity53 said			0
" no blame is needed			0
" when the situation arises , it is up to each individual parent to decide the best way to answer the question , says @entity71 , child and family psychotherapist and author of " the @entity74			1
" while the ages of belief vary greatly from individual to individual , @entity71 says children under the age of 7 years old -- as evidenced in @entity27 's kindergarten class -- are likely to believe what their parents tell them			1
between second and fourth grade is the peak of what @entity71 refers to as the latency phase of child development , and is also the period during which parents can expect the question			2
( eight - year - old @entity91 , who wrote the famous letter to the editor of @entity95 's @entity94 in 1891 , was right on schedule			0
) " the goal of adolescence is to resolve one 's separation from parents and emerge embracing his / her own ideas , opinions , and beliefs , " says @entity71			2
during this phase , parents can expect to see a spike in doubt : whether it 's the child insisting to go to the post office to hand - deliver his or her letter to the @entity115 ; staying up late to guard the fireplace ; comparing handwritten gift tags with @entity119 's chicken scratches to even questioning the logistics of the sleigh travel			2
for the last , former math teacher @entity122 urged his students to think about the four dimensions of length , area , volume and time			0
" we 're able to easily manipulate length , area and volume			0
for length , think about cutting a piece of string ; for area , think about cutting out a square from a piece of paper ; and for volume , think about filling a water balloon			0
the problem is we humans ca n't manipulate time like we can length , area and volume			0
" " but what if @entity9 could ? " he asks			1
" he could make christmas eve 100 , 1,000 , or even 1,000,000 hours long -- just like we can cut a piece of string to any length			0
he 'd have plenty of time to deliver all those presents			0
" wary children can follow @entity9 's journey around the world by satellite on @entity157 , thanks to the @entity159 ( @entity159 ) , which started its holiday tradition in 1955			1
@entity159 , like @entity122 , also suggests that " the only logical conclusion is that @entity9 somehow functions within his own time - space continuum			1
" tracking or not , ultimately any curiosity about the folklore is an opportunity to teach children about the importance of finding their own voice and truths in the world , says @entity171 , a marriage and family therapist			2
" explain to them that the world is a diverse and large place where people hold different views on the same topic , " he says			2
" and further explain that what 's important is to believe in what feels true at a particular moment in time and to hold on to it for however long as it feels honest and true			0
" @entity53 also advocates letting your child come to his or her own conclusions , and that questioning things is a healthy sign of maturity			2
" adults need to take more of a ' curious stance ' than a ' fixing stance ' with this issue			0
ask questions , and do n't be so quick to ' make it all better ' for your child , " recommends @entity53			0
" @entity200 is a symbol of generosity , too , and we all ' believe in ' him			0
if @entity9 is in your heart , he 's real			1
" and as confusing as it may be for the child who still believes , it 's also confusing for the kids who know the truth , such as older siblings , says @entity71			0
being told not to tell a younger brother or sister can be a burden for the elder secret - holder , so @entity71 recommends advising them to reflect instead			2
" say , ' as you get older your ideas and belief may change			0
when we 're younger , it 's fun to believe in @entity9			1
" most importantly for parents , 't is not the season to feel guilty about the @entity9 tradition -- should they choose to participate -- when the folklore is let out of the sleigh bag			1
" moms and dads need to relax and cut themselves some slack , " she says			0
" you are not changing the truth for personal gain or deceit			0
@entity9 is part of our folklore			1
the celebration of @entity25 has included @entity9 for almost all young children			1
you are passing down the folklore , keeping up the tradition and allowing your child to fully enjoy the magic			0
