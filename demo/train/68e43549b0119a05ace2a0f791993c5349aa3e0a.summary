-- there 's something about growing up in a small town			1
do n't get me wrong , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 are all great cities with their own identity and appeal , but if you spent your formative years in a burg where traffic lights were few and far between ; where watching freight trains was a welcome distraction ; where after school , kids waste time at the nearest lake , river or abandoned quarry , then count yourself as lucky			2
this kind of small - town adolescence is uniquely @entity24 , and it 's a lifestyle that 's rapidly vanishing			1
@entity25 perfectly captures this experience in his debut novel , " snapper , " available tuesday			1
@entity25 grew up in @entity29 , @entity30 , and the book makes the most of its @entity34 setting			1
in it , narrator @entity35 is an affable young ornithologist , earning just enough money to live on by studying the songbirds of @entity30			1
not coincidentally , @entity25 also worked as a bird researcher when he was a student at @entity40			1
" @entity28 " follows @entity35 through a series of mostly aimless adventures as he travels across the state in a glitter - festooned truck dubbed the @entity45			1
@entity35 spends a good part of the book in the wilds of @entity30 , where he beautifully describes tracking and observing birds like the summer tanager and wood thrushes , as well as warblers , chickadees and @entity57 flycatchers			1
there are also some hilarious anecdotes involving a dive - bombing bald eagle , a @entity62 shepherd with a knack for digging up human bones and a snapping turtle with a taste for thumbs , hence the title			2
but this is more than a bird book			0
there are plenty of poignant moments as @entity35 tries to figure out his place in the world 's pecking order			2
there 's his on - again , off - again love affair with a free - spirited beauty named @entity80 and a colorful cast of characters including @entity35 's parents , an aunt and uncle from @entity86 with some questionable views on race , a small group of childhood friends and a few shiftless roommates			1
@entity25 writes about all of this in a voice part @entity94 , part @entity96 but uniquely his own			1
the book 's pace is leisurely , the mood is sometimes melancholy , and readers will finish the final page feeling thoroughly satisfied			2
perhaps surprising to readers , @entity25 no longer lives in @entity30			1
after wandering the globe , he now makes his home in @entity106 with his wife and son			0
@entity0 recently spoke to him about the novel and whether he misses the @entity24 the following is an edited transcript			0
@entity0 : what was the spark behind " @entity28 " ? @entity25 : some friends and i used to build fires on @entity30 train tracks at night and sit around with a bottle of something purloined from someone 's parents			1
i told this to an @entity124 friend who knew nothing about @entity30 and who began imagining and describing a romantically desolate sort of place , forsaken by commerce and industry -- that 's how we knew no trains would come through -- a place where there were no girls to talk to and no drugs worth taking , so adolescent boys played hobo together or whatever it was we thought we were doing			1
that is a very @entity124 way of viewing @entity30			1
it is also absolutely right , or it used to be			0
that conversation was a spark			0
@entity0 : had you always wanted to be a writer ? @entity25 : i do n't know when i began writing			1
i won a national award in high school for a short story about a character named @entity151 who commits suicide			0
i have since learned some restraint			0
i had been writing regularly for a couple of years already at the time			0
it 's always been important to me , though , to do other things besides write -- to be something other than or in addition to a writer			2
so i 've worked as a web developer and an @entity124 teacher and an editor and a frozen pizza stacker and so on , in the @entity164 and @entity165 and @entity166 and @entity106			0
@entity0 : where did the title come from ? @entity25 : my editor and i did kick around alternative titles for a while			1
the problem was that other titles ( such as " @entity94 , @entity30 " ) seemed to restrict the book 's scope somehow and that the snapping turtle in the book has symbolic value			1
in the end , it was a case of , well , it ca n't be called anything else , can it ? " @entity28 " is a digressive , meandering book that invites readers to make connections and interpret things as they will			0
a more descriptive title ( say , " birding in @entity30 " ) would n't do that justice			1
also , " snapper " is a snappy title			2
@entity0 : you write with great admiration about @entity30 's songbirds			1
do you have a particular favorite from your days as an amateur ornithologist ? @entity25 : i like the wood thrush , as does the narrator , @entity197 , and as did @entity94 and @entity198 , both			1
it 's probably not humanly possible to listen to the wood thrush attentively without some emotional response			2
whereas the @entity57 flycatcher is pretty boring			0
i think " birdsong " and " songbird " are both misleading words			0
lots of songbirds just chirp			0
i was a research assistant for a major study of songbirds for two years , starting at 5 a.m. six days a week			0
i especially enjoyed running into non-birds			0
foxes , raccoons , opossums , all finishing up the night shift at around the time i started			0
their collective expression was : " hey , you 're human			0
either shoot us or leave us alone			0
stop coming around every day			0
" @entity0 : you seem to have a love / hate relationship with @entity30 , is that correct ? has your feeling for your home state changed since you 've lived abroad ? @entity25 : i love it from a great distance			1
there are many things in @entity30 that i appreciate more for having lived abroad			2
@entity229 in @entity29 tops the list			0
@entity231 and @entity232 are outstanding , and the @entity233 is the most beautiful river in the world , as @entity235 observed 200 - odd years ago			2
not sure what the beautiful - river criteria are , but it 's true			2
i think a lot , in a possibly @entity243 - inflected way , about the cultural heritage of southern @entity30 ( five words that do not often appear in that sequence )			1
it 's not all pretty , but it 's all important			2
@entity0 : what 's it like now , having moved to @entity106 , and would you ever return to the @entity248 ? @entity25 : i would certainly return to the @entity248			1
i spent three months there last summer with my wife and son , in fact , and all of us enjoyed it immensely			0
that said , after 10 years in @entity106 , there were a few things i found a wee bit alarming			0
health care costs and the size of the average pickup truck , for example			0
the idea that random civilians may carry guns or , for that matter , that the police do carry guns			0
i suppose i experience a mild form of culture shock			0
@entity0 : what 's next for you ? @entity25 : i am working on another novel also set in southern @entity30			1
read an excerpt from " snapper " here			2

@entity25 captures a rapidly vanishing way of life in " snapper "
aimless adventures in birdwatching also describe small - town life in @entity30
