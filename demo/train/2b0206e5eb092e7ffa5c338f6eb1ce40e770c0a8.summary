-- back in 1971 , i was present as top leaders of two political organizations met to negotiate common actions they could take despite their differences			1
one of those leaders was a woman			2
over and over , she raised points for consideration , only to be ignored by both sides			0
when someone of the other team did agree with a proposal she made , he would wait a few minutes and then say so to one of her male colleagues , as though the suggestion had been his			0
" as you said , @entity18 , " or " that 's probably the way to go , @entity22			2
" no one on her team corrected the misattribution , though they laughed about it afterward			0
as the woman matter - of - factly explained to me , " he could n't admit anything we said was right if he also had to admit that it had come from a woman			1
" how far have we come in 40 years ? according to a new book on the the @entity40 administration , many of the president 's advisers initially showed similar disregard for women			1
for the first two years , senior female aides complained that male colleagues ignored them , excluded them from key policy meetings , dismissed their opinions and limited their access to the president			2
it is clear , however , that we have come a long way			0
when told of the women 's concerns , president @entity40 convened a dinner with the female staff and took steps to make the atmosphere more inclusive and empowering			1
our nation now has three women on the @entity59 , all of whom out - talk at least one of their male colleagues			1
and we have a female secretary of state who by all accounts does not get muscled aside by anyone , male or female			0
assessing the extent and impact of gender stereotypes is more complex today than it was in the early 1960s			2
back then , " head and master " laws gave husbands the final say in most family decisions			0
quotas limited the number of women who could be admitted to law or dental school			2
" help wanted " ads for men only excluded women from even applying for most highly paid and challenging jobs			0
and of course , men and women in the same jobs were treated differently in salary and promotions			0
women now earn more @entity91 's and @entity92 's than men do , and they have pulled even in @entity94 's			1
today , education trumps gender in determining pay , with the result that in most metropolitan regions women in their 20s tend to out - earn men in the same age group because of their greater educational achievement			1
by contrast , in 1970 , a female college graduate who worked full - time year - round earned less than a white male high school graduate			1
as president @entity40 's senior staff discovered , gender stereotypes still encourage men to dominate and females to defer , perpetuating women 's second - class status in the workforce			1
yet these same stereotypes can also penalize males in ways that were not obvious in the past , when male privilege had so many more legal and administrative supports			0
the mystique of masculinity , for example , encourages many men to view studying hard as " a girl thing			0
" it also leads many to seek work in the unstable , seasonal construction sector or in other " manly " jobs , many of which are concentrated in declining industries , rather than preparing themselves for " traditionally female " jobs in health care , child care , teaching , and social work			0
" @entity139 " males bully other males who show interest in such work , accusing them of acting " gay " or being " girlie - men			0
" and when men defy these stereotypes to seek such work , they often encounter gender discrimination from employers who believe that a man can not be as good a nurturer or helper as a woman			1
but at the top of the educational , economic , and political pyramid -- in what were traditionally " male " kinds of work -- gender stereotypes continue to penalize women			1
@entity160 , an organization formed in 1962 to help women enter the workplace , titled its 2007 report on the attitudes of more than 1,200 senior executives in the @entity166 and @entity167 toward female employees : " damned if you do , damned if you do n't			0
" according to their report , when women " act assertively , focus on work tasks , display ambition , " or engage in other behaviors that receive high praise when done by men , they are perceived as " too tough " and " unfeminine			1
" but when women pay attention to work relationships and express " concern for other people 's perspective , " they are considered less competent than men			1
in the television news industry , two - thirds of the news producers , but only 20 percent of the news directors , are female			0
men make up more than three - quarters of all workers earning more than $ 100,000 a year , and only 2 percent of @entity195 companies are run by women			1
part of this pattern may stem from women 's socialization not to put themselves forward too much			2
young women are four times less likely than young men to negotiate their first salary , and economists estimate that this unwillingness to assert their own worth as workers ends up costing women $ 500,000 in earnings by the time they reach 60			0
but part of the problem is that women 's worth is consistently undervalued by others			1
a march 2010 study by the @entity217 found that among postdoctoral applicants , women had to publish three more papers in the most prestigious journals , or 20 more in the less - prestigious ones , to be considered as productive as male applicants			2
and it remains true that many men are still socialized to put themselves forward too much , and literally can not hear women who ask for what they want			0
a wise executive -- in a school , a business , or a nation -- must help his or her team learn to respect all styles of self - presentation and to listen to all views , as @entity40 evidently did when it was brought to his attention			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241 .			2

@entity241 : in 1971 she watched as a man took credit for a woman 's idea at a meeting
she says a book says high - level women in @entity40 's @entity251 complained of being *marginalized*
but reports say @entity40 met with them to fix problem , she says ; powerful women are no longer rare
@entity241 : stereotypes still *thwart* *progress* ; smart *bosses* step in , as @entity40 apparently did
