@entity0 -- the ordeal of @entity3 did not simply begin and end with the physical attack of her rape			1
the rape began a years - long nightmare of further pain , culminating in an awful choice she must now make			1
even two years later , @entity3 remembers the smell and state of her rapist 's clothes when he came into the house when her mother left for a brief visit to the hospital			1
" he had filthy clothes on as he does metal and construction work			0
when my mother went out , he came into my house and he closed doors and windows			0
i started screaming , but he shut me up by putting his hands on my mouth , " she said			0
the rapist was her cousin 's husband			0
after the attack , she hid what happened as long as she could			0
but soon she began vomiting in the mornings and showing signs of pregnancy			0
it was her attacker 's child			2
in @entity40 , this brought her not sympathy , but prosecution			1
aged just 19 , she was found guilty by the courts of sex outside of marriage -- adultery -- and sentenced to twelve years in jail			1
now inside @entity0 's @entity50 jail , she and her child are serving her sentence together			0
sitting with the baby in her lap , her face carefully covered , she explains the only choice she has that would end her incarceration			2
the only way around the dishonor of rape , or adultery in the eyes of @entity40 , is to marry her attacker			1
this will , in the eyes of some , give her child a family and restore her honor			2
incredibly , this is something that @entity3 is willing to do			1
" i was asked if i wanted to start a new life by getting released , by marrying this man " , she told @entity1 in an exclusive interview			0
" my answer was that one man dishonored me , and i want to stay with that man			0
" tending to her daughter in the jail 's cold , she added : " my daughter is a little innocent child			2
who knew i would have a child in this way			0
a lot of people told me that after your daughter 's born give it to someone else , but my aunt told me to keep her as proof of my innocence			1
" @entity3 's choice is stark			1
women in her situation are often killed for the shame their ordeal has brought the community			1
she is at risk , some say , from her attacker 's family			2
we found @entity3 's convicted rapist in a jail across town			1
while he denied raping her , he agreed that she would likely be killed if she gets out of jail			2
but he insists that it will be her family , not his , that will kill her , " out of shame			2
" whether threatened by his family or hers , for now , jail may be the safest place for her			0
shockingly , @entity3 's case is common in @entity40			1
@entity1 asked a spokesman for the prosecutor to comment on the case			0
the reply was that there were hundreds such cases and the office would need time to look into it			0
but @entity3 's plight has found international attention because of a dispute between the @entity126 and a team of documentary makers hired to report on women 's rights in @entity40			1
the documentary makers filmed a lengthy report on @entity3 and other women , showing her talking openly about her fate			1
they showed the film to the @entity126 , who were paying for it as part of a project on female rights here			0
after viewing it , the @entity126 decided to spike the project			0
the @entity126 said it was concerned about the safety of the women in the film : they could be identified and might face reprisals			0
the filmmakers however suspect -- citing an email leaked from the @entity126 delegation -- that the @entity126 might also be motivated by its sensitive relationship with @entity40 justice institutions , since he film shows the @entity40 justice system in a very unflattering light			1
the leaked email says : " the delegation also has to consider its relations with [ @entity40 ] justice institutions in connection with the other work that it is doing in the sector			1
" the @entity164 to @entity40 , @entity165 , rejected any political motivation in asking for the film not to be shown			2
" what i am concerned about is that situation of the women			2
about the security and well being , that 's of paramount importance , the key criteria according to which i , as representative of the @entity126 will judge , " said the ambassdor			0
under @entity40 law , @entity3 has been judged an adulterer			1
despite the ongoing dispute over her story , her predicament has not changed			0
she faces the hideous choice of 12 years in jail or marriage to her rapist and risk death			1
it 's a marriage she says she 'll accept , so her child can continue to have a mother .			0
