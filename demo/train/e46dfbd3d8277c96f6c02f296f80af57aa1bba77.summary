-- on this date , july 30 , nearly a half - century ago , the @entity1 achieved a major victory			1
@entity4 , the nation 's first national health insurance program , was born			1
as part of president @entity9 's @entity8 , @entity4 extended health coverage to seniors who inevitably needed care			1
it 's been a well - accepted success and highlights the benefits of improving health care access			1
but despite monday 's cautiously optimistic report on @entity4 's solvency , a sustainable and comprehensive health care system requires covering everybody			1
expanding @entity4 for all is the fairest , most effective and straightforward way to ensure universal coverage in @entity1			1
with @entity4 , seniors have greater access to care			2
yet most people deal with an overly complex system that fails to provide the same benefits our seniors receive			0
even after the passage of @entity33 , unacceptable burdens remain			0
consider the health coverage of women			1
today women consume the most health care services			1
they have greater annual health care expenses than men and pay a greater proportion of their health care costs out - of - pocket			1
the @entity44 reports that about one in five women is still uninsured			0
more than half these women struggle with their medical bills			0
the story is even worse for low - income women , who are more likely to forgo treatment because of its cost			0
about 4 million low - income women can cover only themselves and are unable to receive financial support to purchase insurance for their families			0
women make up two - thirds of the low wage workforce -- and only 23 % of low - wage jobs provide employer - sponsored health insurance			0
@entity33 was supposed to help			0
but 3 million low - income and minority women live in states that have yet to expand @entity67 , leaving them unable to obtain @entity33 's coverage for our most vulnerable families , which was promised in the law			2
to be sure , @entity33 does offer greater protections and support for working women to obtain basic insurance			0
but with the fluctuating and often excessive premiums , deductibles and co-pays , these bills remain onerous			0
accesses to in - network physicians remain restricted			0
women , like so many working @entity1 , are getting nickel - and - dimed , unable to afford and access comprehensive medical coverage			2
our health plans continue to be held hostage by private carriers who must spend on hefty overhead and marketing to guarantee ever - growing profits for their shareholders			2
to make matters worse , the courts have further restricted the availability of comprehensive coverage			0
with the @entity1 @entity100 's ruling in @entity101 v. @entity102 , which gave companies the ability to withhold benefits based on religious grounds , women may lose coverage for basic birth control and reproductive health needs			1
it 's unconscionable that in the richest nation on @entity113 , health disparities linger because ordinary people ca n't obtain good care			1
working families continue to wrestle with pocketbook - busting medical expenses and tussle with companies that get in between them and their physician			0
it does n't have to be this way			0
we could provide hassle - free health care to both men and women just as we do for everyone over 65			2
by opening @entity4 to everyone , we could secure universal coverage and run a more efficient and just system			1
@entity4 is far from perfect , but the flexible program stands strong			2
by expanding it , we can better pay for quality care and bargain with hospitals , drug companies and device firms on behalf of everyday people			2
all @entity1 could obtain quality care from any physician			1
and similar to how they do it in most wealthy nations , the government will reimburse the provider or company for that care			0
businesses could focus on staying competitive rather than haggling with insurance companies over costly health plans for their workers			0
we can fund the plan by preserving how we pay for health care and asking our very well - off to contribute a little more			2
the government would levy a small increase in payroll taxes on employers -- who would no longer have to pay health plan premiums -- and also issue a small tax on stock and bond transactions			0
a single - payer health care system built off @entity4 would guarantee universal coverage and far better health outcomes			1
to that end , @entity164 's @entity1 rep. @entity163 , a @entity165 , has again introduced his @entity4 - for - all proposal			1
@entity1 rep. @entity170 , @entity171 , and @entity1 sen. @entity172 , i - @entity169 , have introduced a similar version			0
outside our nation 's capital , @entity169 is working to implement universal coverage for its residents next year , aiming to serve as a model for the rest of the nation			2
as @entity172 said , " the @entity1 is the only major nation in the industrialized world that does not guarantee health care as a right to its people			1
" what @entity1 is doing on health care is n't working for either men or women			1
if we want to join the rest of the industrialized world , we must increase eligibility to the widely popular program , @entity4 , which celebrates its 49th anniversary on wednesday			1
the nation deserves a system that values wellness above profits , and progress over inertia and false starts .			0

@entity202 : nearly 50 years old , @entity4 has been a success and has improved health care
he says we should extend @entity4 health coverage to assure quality care for all
@entity202 : report optimistic on @entity4 ' solvency : it 's efficient and just way for universal care
@entity202 : @entity1 only major nation in industrialized world that does n't guarantee right of health care
