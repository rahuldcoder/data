-- @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 traded in their tiaras for a toolbox , and they 're encouraging other girls to follow suit in a new online campaign promoting @entity11 , a company that claims to make " toys for future inventors			1
" the company was started by @entity14 , a @entity15 - educated engineer , to " disrupt the pink aisle " and " get girls building			1
" @entity18 says her ultimate goal is to bridge the gap of gender disparity in engineering ; according to the @entity23 , women account for 24 % of the science , technology , engineering and math work force			0
the popular ad featuring the trio of inventive girls is ironically set to the decidedly misogynistic @entity33 song " girls , " which includes lyrics like " girls , to do the dishes " and " her pants were tight , and that 's ok			2
" siblings make clothes for girls ' to just be kids ' in the @entity11 version , the lyrics are synchronized with a @entity47 contraption ( you know , like @entity50 's breakfast machine ) and altered to convey a more feminist message : " you like to buy us pink toys , and everything else is for boys and you can always get us dolls and we 'll grow up like them ... false			1
" the video has garnered more than 3.5 million views online over the course of a few days and is one of four finalists in @entity64 's " @entity63 , @entity65 " contest			0
the contest winner will nab a multimillion - dollar ad spot during the @entity68 on february 2			2
@entity69 says pink toy ovens discourage boys from kitchen play although most of the reactions on social media have been echoes of " girl power , " some criticized the pink girl - targeted toys as hypocritical and only further divisive of gender lines			0
