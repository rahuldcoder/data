@entity0 -- public schools in @entity4 states can continue teacher - led reciting of the @entity7 , after a federal court ruled against a group of atheist parents			1
the 9th @entity11 , based in @entity12 , @entity13 , ruled 2 - 1 thursday that the pledge does not represent a government endorsement of religion , prohibited by the @entity17			1
" the @entity7 serves to unite our vast nation through the proud recitation of some of the ideals upon which our republic was founded and for which we continue to strive : one nation under @entity27 , " wrote the majority			1
" millions of people daily recite these words when pledging allegiance to the @entity31			0
" the ruling applies only to the 11 states and territories in the @entity35 covered by the @entity36 , but it reinforces other rulings from other courts upholding the pledge			1
the same appeals court also ruled separately thursday , upholding the use of the words " @entity43 " on @entity31 money			1
the lawsuit was brought by several parents in the @entity47 , @entity13 , area who objected to the school policy			0
among them is @entity51 , a prominent attorney and atheist , who had brought his long - standing dispute to the @entity31 @entity54 in 2004			1
the justices had dismissed that earlier appeal on purely technical grounds , over questions he lacking standing as a custodial parent to bring the lawsuit on behalf of his school - age daughter			1
@entity51 then recruited other parents into the current case			0
@entity51 said he would appeal thursday 's decision but acknowledged his dim prospects going forward			1
" this was the appeal and this is the end of the road in terms of what you 're guaranteed , " he said			2
@entity51 said he 'll ask for a rehearing and , if that fails , will appeal to the @entity54			2
" but they do n't have to take it , " he said , referring to the nation 's high court , " and the odds are pretty good that they wo n't			2
" a woman identified only as @entity80 was a key plaintiff , arguing she did not believe in @entity27			0
she claimed the daily recitation interfered with her right to direct her child 's upbringing and that it indoctrinated her child with the belief that @entity27 exists			0
children are not required to stand and repeat the pledge , but some parents said the social pressures to conform were an improper infringement of their rights			0
the plaintiffs now have the option of asking the @entity54 to hear the case			0
the appeals court framed the issue as a dispute over whether was a traditional patriotic exercise or a blatant religious message			1
the same court in 2002 agreed with @entity51 and other atheist parents			1
in dissent to thursday 's ruling , judge @entity103 said the pledge was an overtly religious message			1
" carrying out such an indoctrination in a public school classroom unconstitutionally forces many young children either to profess a religious belief antithetical to their personal views or to declare themselves through their silence or nonparticipation to be protesting nonbelievers , thereby subjecting themselves to hostility and ridicule , " he wrote			0
the @entity54 previously has ruled the mere mention of @entity27 or religion by the government in a public setting does not necessarily mean a violation of the " @entity123 " of the @entity17 , which ensures the separation of church and state			1
examples that have met high court scrutiny include @entity127 or @entity129 menorah displays in a public park ; opening a legislative session with a prayer ; granting tax breaks for religious organizations ; and reimbursing transportation costs for parents whose end their children to parochial schools			2
the pledge was written in 1892 by baptist minister and educator @entity141 , who made no reference to religion in his version			2
it was originally worded : " i pledge allegiance to my flag and the republic for which it stands , one nation , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all			2
" it quickly became a part of public school programs			0
in 1954 , @entity158 added the words " under @entity27 , " at the urging of the @entity161 and other groups			0
another modification was to change " my flag " to " the flag of the @entity31			0
" " this decision is a victory for common sense , " @entity166 @entity165 of the @entity161 said in a news release			0
" today , the court got it absolutely right : recitation of the pledge is a patriotic exercise , not a religious prayer			1
... every reasonable person knows that , and today 's decision is a breath of fresh air from a court system that has too often seemed to be almost allergic to public references to @entity27			0
" the case is @entity51 v. @entity185 ( 05 - 17257 ) .			0

new : prominent attorney , an atheist , said prospects are dim , but he plans to appeal
appeals court : @entity7 does not represent a government endorsement of religion
ruling covers only the 11 @entity4 states and territories covered by the @entity36
dissenting justice in 2 - 1 ruling said the pledge is an overtly religious message
