@entity0 -- there 's a new distinction in the strife between @entity5 and @entity7 - based armed groups -- @entity5 's portable anti-rocket system called the @entity9			1
with the ability to effectively take down mid-range rockets targeted at @entity5 cities , and with a success rate of over 90 % , the system is helping @entity5 offset the most widespread threat to its citizens in recent years , according to @entity5 officials			1
thirty - seven rockets fired out of @entity7 towards @entity5 cities have been intercepted since friday , a spokesman for the @entity19 said sunday			1
" i must point out that the @entity9 system has proven itself very well and we will , of course , see to its expansion in the months and years ahead			1
we will do everything in our power to expand the deployment of this system , " @entity5 prime minister @entity25 said sunday at his cabinet meeting			2
casualties mount in attacks between @entity7 , @entity5 first deployed in april 2011 , the @entity9 system targets incoming rockets it identifies as possible threats to city centers and fires an interceptor missile to destroy them in mid-air			1
each battery is equipped with an interception management center to calculate the expected location of impact , and to prioritize targets according to pre-defined targets			0
the battery also has firing - control radar used to identify targets , and a portable missile launcher			0
the makers of the system praise its mobility , with just a few hours required to relocate and set up , thereby enabling the @entity5 military to adjust itself on multiple fronts			0
@entity5 officials say although the system currently is deployed near three major cities in the south of @entity5 , it is capable of handling missile threats in other fronts if needed			2
but such protection comes at a price			0
developed by @entity5 's defense technology company @entity64 , the system carries an the estimated cost for each battery of tens of millions of dollars			1
each " @entity69 " interception missile used by the system comes at a price of no less than $ 62,000			0
while the initial development of the system was a sole @entity5 enterprise , the system is now heavily sponsored by the @entity74			1
in may of 2010 , the @entity74 @entity75 approved a plan to allocate $ 205 million for @entity5 's @entity9			1
@entity5 currently has three @entity9 batteries and is scheduled to receive a fourth in the coming months			2
according to @entity5 media , @entity5 plans to deploy a total of nine batteries by 2013			0
a defense ministry official told @entity1 that @entity5 would need up to 13 batteries to completely cover all its borders			0
but how important is the @entity9 for @entity5 ? according to former @entity5 ambassador to the @entity74 @entity86 , the @entity9 could potentially be a real game - changer			1
" the most important question is how would the @entity9 affect the decisions of @entity90 leaders and their @entity92 supporters ? while @entity90 rockets are aimed primarily to target civilians and terrorize the @entity5 home front , a secondary and just important aim is to hit strategic sites in the future			2
eliminating the ability to hit strategic targets may lead @entity90 to rethink the efficiency of acquiring the rockets it has used in the past , " @entity86 said			0
visiting an @entity9 battery saturday , @entity5 defense minister @entity105 gave an insight into the broader advantages of defensive skills			2
" this system is part of a wider multi-layer interception system , which not only protects our citizens but also allows freedom of activity for the @entity19 and political leadership			0
this is crucial as we face threats from all around us , " @entity105 said .			0

the @entity9 system targets incoming rockets and fires missiles to intercept
its success rate is over 90 % , officials say
@entity19 : since friday , the system has stopped *37* rockets fired out of @entity7 toward @entity5 cities
but the @entity74 - sponsored system is costing tens of millions of dollars
