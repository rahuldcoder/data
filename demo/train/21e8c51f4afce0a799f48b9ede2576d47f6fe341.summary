@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 will soon rejoin @entity5 's military command more than 40 years after it left , @entity1 president @entity3 said tuesday			1
@entity1 president @entity3 has aligned @entity1 more closely with the @entity6 @entity1 was a founding member of the alliance in 1949 but it left the military structure in 1966 amid frictions with the @entity6			1
@entity1 has continued , however , to contribute troops to @entity5 missions and to participate in @entity5 's political bodies			1
analysts expect that when @entity1 takes over the rotating six - month presidency of the @entity16 next month , @entity3 will try to boost the @entity16 defense dimension			2
some nations , particularly the @entity6 , have been suspicious of a greater @entity16 defense initiative , seeing it as an attempt to undermine @entity5			0
@entity3 's move , which he has signaled for months , could be seen as an attempt to reconcile the two sides and help the @entity6 warm to the idea of the @entity16 having its own security organization			2
" basically , the tradeoff is that they no longer suspect @entity1 motives in pushing for a greater @entity16 defense dimension because of @entity3 's willingness to make @entity1 a fully participating member of @entity5 , " said @entity28 , @entity2 's @entity29 political editor			1
from its earliest years , @entity5 's transatlantic ties were strained because @entity6 analysts warned that if the @entity29 allies failed to increase their contributions to the alliance , they risked losing the support of the @entity6 , according to @entity5			0
the @entity29 allies felt the @entity6 was trying to dominate @entity5 , and the resulting frictions led @entity1 president @entity42 to withdraw from @entity5 's military structure in 1966 , according to @entity5			1
that decision meant no @entity1 forces could be under permanent allied command and that @entity1 would have no participation in defense planning			0
in 1995 , @entity1 rejoined @entity5 's military committee , which advises @entity5 's political authorities on military policy and strategy and provides guidance on military matters to @entity5 's strategic commanders			1
while @entity1 was still not a part of the military command , it contributed troops and funding to @entity5 activities , including @entity62 in @entity63 and @entity64 in @entity65			2
some 5,000 @entity1 troops are currently committed to @entity5 operations and @entity1 contributes 13.8 percent of its military budget to the alliance , according to the @entity70			0
the @entity72 , an @entity16 think tank , said @entity3 's move will end a " ruinous quarrel " between @entity29 's two main security organizations -- @entity5 and the @entity16 defense initiative			0
" @entity3 has broken a long - standing taboo in @entity1 foreign policy and opened the possibility of a dramatic improvement in @entity16 - @entity5 cooperation , " the @entity72 said in december , after the president hinted at the move he made tuesday			1
the @entity29 security and defense policy , or @entity86 , has its origins in the 1990s , when @entity16 leaders decided @entity29 needed its own military and civilian capabilities for security			0
so far , the @entity86 is still just a framing of common defense policy which might one day lead to a common defense , according to the @entity16			0
the @entity86 does not involve the creation of a @entity29 army , the @entity16 says .			0
