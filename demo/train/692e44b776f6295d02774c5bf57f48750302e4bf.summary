@entity1 detainees have long been considered @entity3 's most dangerous enemies			1
so what happens when they walk free -- like the five detainees swapped for @entity8 sgt. @entity7 ? do they return to terror activities or transition to quiet , private lives away from the mayhem ? well , it 's a mixture of both			1
how dangerous is this latest swap ? mathematically , it 's not an even swap			2
but president @entity20 's administration maintains it 's not a risky move for the @entity3			2
the five detainees have been at @entity1 in @entity23 for years , and out of commission for a long time			1
they probably do n't have extensive networks to tap into , according to two senior @entity3 officials			2
additionally , there will be fewer @entity3 forces to target in @entity30 since under a new agreement , most troops will be out of the nation next year			2
@entity33 has also reassured the @entity3 that it will aggressively monitor the detainees , who will be under a travel ban for one year			1
how many freed detainees have returned to terrorism ? at its peak , @entity1 had 770 men believed by the @entity3 government to be involved in terrorist activity or military attacks			1
that number has dwindled significantly			2
as of last month , the facility had 154 detainees			1
a september 2013 report from the director of national intelligence reflected on what happened to the roughly 600 people who left @entity1 between its opening in 2002 and july 2013			1
of those , 100 -- or 16.6 % of the released prisoners -- were " confirmed " to have returned " to terrorist activities			1
" seventeen of those died , while 27 ended up in custody , according to the @entity57 report			1
an additional 70 are " suspected of reengaging , " it said			0
" based on trends identified during the past 10 years , we assess that if additional detainees are transferred without conditions ... some will reengage in terrorist or insurgent activities , " the report said			1
does the @entity3 keep an eye on freed detainees ? while the former prisoners are no longer under its control , @entity69 says it keeps track of them , which is the basis of the @entity57 report			1
during president @entity76 's administration , some were handed over to authorities in other countries			0
dozens more were released under @entity20			0
are @entity3 interests more at risk when they get out ? there are a lot of variables , making this a debatable question			0
except for those accused or convicted of the most heinous crimes such as murder , most people are not detained indefinitely			0
and studies show the recidivism rate for those in the @entity3 legal system typically top 50 % or even 60 % , according to the @entity93			1
armed with that knowledge , the idea of a @entity1 detainee returning to his previous ways may not be surprising			1
it also depends on where they go from there			0
the @entity57 report notes the dangers of transferring prisoners to nations with conflicts , instability and active recruitment by terror groups			1
in other words , a detainee who returns to a place beset by violence -- where terrorist groups and attacks are common -- is more likely to return to the fold			1
does this mean the @entity3 got a raw deal in @entity7 's release ? depends on whom you ask			0
sen. @entity122 , a former prisoner of war , is not popping the @entity123 just yet			0
he knows a thing or two about life in enemy hands after spending more than five years in captivity in @entity128			0
since then , he has emerged as one of the nation 's loudest , boldest voices on military matters			0
and he feels strongly that the @entity3 did not think this through			0
" do n't trade one person for five ( of ) the hardest of the hard - core , murdering war criminals who will clearly re-enter the fight and send them to @entity33 , of all places , " he told @entity135 's @entity134 on tuesday night			0
but @entity143 national security adviser @entity142 defended the @entity20 administration 's decision			0
the " acute urgency " of @entity7 's health condition justified the president not notifying @entity147 beforehand that he was being swapped for the five detainees , she said			1
why are terror suspects held at @entity1 ? the @entity3 naval base there was transformed after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			1
existing migrant detention facilities were revamped to house detainees of the so - called war on terror			1
these were men , who though captured in the battlefield , did n't fit any detention category			2
@entity3 authorities said they did n't have the same rights as prisoners of war under the @entity166			0
nor did they have the same rights as those detained within the @entity3			0
the @entity76 administration argued that since the detainees were not on @entity3 soil , they were not covered by the @entity173			2
it used that rationale to justify the lack of legal protections for those detained			0
that made the base sometimes referred to as @entity1 a sort of @entity182			1
how much does it cost to keep it running ? it costs the @entity186 about $ 150 million a year to keep the facility in operation			2
the @entity3 pays @entity23 about $ 4,085 a year for the lease , but the latter has n't accepted payment since 1959			0
shortly after his inauguration in 2009 , @entity20 signed an executive order to close the detention facility within one year			1
has everyone at @entity1 been found guilty of terrorism ? no. @entity198 , a @entity135 national security analyst , and @entity200 , a research associate at the @entity201 , wrote in an op - ed last year that said dozens of detainees cleared for release years ago " remain in seemingly perpetual custody			1
" " they have found to be guilty of nothing , yet they are being held indefinitely , " @entity198 and @entity200 wrote			1
" @entity210 detention without charge is a policy that we usually associate with dictatorships , not democracies			2
" @entity198 also heads the @entity201 's @entity216			0
others , though , view the situation differently			0
they say terrorists do n't play by any recognized rules of warfare or justice ; their mission is to kill , with @entity3 forces and citizens as their targets			0
@entity122 says that the five men released as part of the @entity7 deal could be among those attacking @entity3 citizens both at home and overseas			0
the five " were judged time after time as unworthy ... that needed to be kept in detention because they posed a risk and a threat to the @entity3 , " the @entity234 @entity233 said			2
who were the detainees swapped for @entity7 ? two senior @entity20 administration officials identified them as @entity243 , mullah @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 and @entity247			2
they were mostly mid- to high - level officials in the @entity250 regime who were detained early in the war in @entity30 because of their positions within the @entity250 , not because of ties to @entity254			0
but some such as @entity243 are alleged to have been " directly associated " with @entity255 and @entity254 's now - deceased leader in @entity257 , @entity256 .			0

about 17 % of @entity1 detainees return to terrorist activities , report says
as of last month , the @entity1 detention facility had 154 detainees
not everyone at @entity1 has been found guilty of terrorism
