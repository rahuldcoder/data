-- the proposed purchase of @entity4 's @entity3 beer brands by the world 's largest brewing conglomerate , @entity7 - @entity5 , is causing deep concern among @entity10 's craft brewers			1
@entity7 already controls about 47 % of the @entity10 beer market			1
adding @entity3 's @entity13 beer and other brands would give it another 6 %			1
@entity16 , the other big player in the @entity10 , controls about 30 %			1
if the @entity3 deal goes through , a duopoly would control more than 80 % of the @entity10 beer market			1
the concentration of market share in two global companies means they have tremendous influence over distributors and retailers			1
this gives an advantage to big brewer beer brands over small brands created by @entity10 's independent craft brewers			1
ultimately , with limited choices , the beer consumer loses			2
the @entity34 is determining whether the sale would violate antitrust laws			0
as i understand it , @entity7 claims it would have no say in the marketing or sale of @entity3 brands in the @entity10			1
those functions would be left to @entity43 , the @entity45 - based marketing and sales company that is owned by @entity46 , the world 's largest wine company			0
in 10 years , @entity7 would have the right to buy @entity43			1
it 's hard to understand how a brewery could own another brewery and not have some control over sales and marketing			0
does n't the owner control the price of beer sold to the importer / marketer ? does n't the owner contribute to the sales and marketing programs and costs of the importer / marketer ? does n't the owner have some say over the hiring of personnel for the brewery it owns ? @entity71 : learn how to homebrew and is n't the owner responsible to its shareholders to ensure the brewery is maximizing shareholder value ? @entity10 's small brewers have been on a roll in the past decade , claiming more than 6 % of the @entity10 beer market since the craft brewing revolution began in the early ' 80s			1
that 6 % is divided by 2,400 small companies			0
the duopoly already has tremendous influence over beer distribution in @entity10			1
in most markets , brewers have two choices , a so - called @entity89 and @entity90 distributor , who sells @entity16 brands , or a @entity94 distributor , who sells @entity7 brands			1
( the color codes describe the primary colors of the brewers ' labels			0
) through so - called " equity contracts , " the large brewers prescribe how much money distributors spend to sell and market their brands			2
in some cases , they have the right to approve or disapprove the manager of the distribution company			0
in some cases , they have the right to approve the succession plan of the distributor			0
in some cases , they have the right to approve the sale of a distributor			0
craft brewers constantly struggle to get the attention of these distributors			1
in the mid- 1990s , the ceo of @entity7 , @entity123 , declared that he wanted " 100 % share of mind " from his wholesalers			1
some red distributors ejected @entity129 brands from their warehouses			0
distributors who gave his 100 % were given more favorable terms for their purchase of beer			2
@entity136 is gone , but the new owners of @entity7 have called for distributors to get " aligned " with the brands they control			2
large brewers also have control over some retail sales of beer			2
many chain supermarkets and stores appoint " category captains " to determine which beers are sold in refrigerated aisles and which beers go on the warm shelves			0
if the category captain is a @entity89 and @entity90 distributor , @entity16 will play a key role in choosing which brands get sold where			2
if it is a @entity94 distributor , @entity7 makes the calls			2
this results in a tug - of - war between large brewers trying to get maximum placement of their brands and small brewers trying to get a spot			0
obviously , a company that controls 53 % of the @entity10 beer market is going to have a better shot at shelf space than my company			1
both members of the duopoly have wholly owned brands like @entity170 and @entity171 that are presented as craft brands			2
they own large shares of some other breweries like @entity175 and @entity176			0
there is concern that these brands would get greater attention from wholesalers than independent craft brands , like mine			0
this can greatly limit the beer consumer 's choices			0
in sports venues like arenas and stadiums , the large brewers monopolize space			0
they typically have advertising contracts with the venues , and this results in their having a dominant share of the beer taps and other beer placements			2
if you want a @entity202 at @entity203 or @entity204 or the new @entity205 in @entity206 , you 'd better be prepared to spend some time searching			0
@entity207 is in those venues , but in a very limited way			0
more beer news on @entity71 those are my concerns , and the concerns of other craft brewers			1
obviously , i am not an attorney			0
i know little about antitrust law			0
i recently read a couple of books about the oil industry and learned that antitrust rulings in that industry have drawn a line for defining a company with too much market share			1
given this , i am baffled by the state of the @entity10 brewing industry			2
how did we ever get to a situation where two companies control 80 % ? and how can we allow them to control more ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity234 .			1

@entity234 : @entity7 aims to buy @entity3 , @entity13 beer maker ; craft brewers worry
already @entity16 and @entity7 control most of @entity10 beer market ; deal would make it 80 %
he says the duopoly has huge influence on beer distribution ; leaves craft brewers struggling
@entity234 : in other industries , like oil , antitrust rulings draw line for market share . why not for beer ?
