@entity0 -- some say that the @entity4 document dump has embarrassed the @entity6 government			1
agreed -- it is probably no fun to be the @entity6 official in charge of calling @entity12 prime minister @entity11 to admit that our government noticed his @entity16 business dealings			2
but here 's who really should be embarrassed : those who pooh - poohed @entity22 's " axis of evil			0
" @entity4 confirms that @entity23 and @entity24 have for years been sharing weapons technology			1
those who suggest that it 's some " @entity28 lobby " or @entity30 cabal that is driving the confrontation with @entity23			2
@entity4 confirms that the region 's @entity33 governments express even more anxiety than @entity28 about the @entity23 nuclear weapons program			1
those who have condemned @entity28 for inspecting or impeding @entity39 ambulances			0
@entity4 confirms that during the 2006 @entity41 war , @entity23 smuggled weapons to @entity43 in @entity39 vehicles , including ambulances			1
those who have appeased @entity39 demands that @entity28 's @entity46 be excluded from international @entity39 organizations			0
the @entity39 has been thoroughly penetrated by the @entity48 and is regularly used as a tool of @entity23 foreign policy			2
those who lamented that @entity28 's interception of the @entity54 blockade - runner @entity53 would alienate @entity54 as a key @entity6 ally : the @entity6 government itself has for years regarded the @entity54 government as trending on its own impetus toward anti-western @entity60 radicalism			2
those who look blank - faced at the origin of cyber-attacks on @entity64 and other crucial @entity6 networks			2
@entity4 documents @entity6 awareness that at least one cyber-attack on @entity64 was ordered at the highest levels of the @entity70 government			1
this is not to deny that @entity4 has done enormous harm			2
the leakers or hackers or whoever it was who obtained and published this information have put individual lives at risk			0
@entity79 of the @entity80 notes that one of the released documents names a @entity6 informant in the region			1
the document identifies him as a @entity87 - educated engineer from a prominent pre-revolution @entity89 family who once owned a large factory in @entity23 and is a former national fencing champion of @entity23 , a former president of the @entity94 and a former vice president of an @entity97 sports association			0
@entity79 aptly asks : how many such persons do you think are out there ? but here 's the ghastliest irony of the leak			0
if it was @entity106 's intention to use information hacked from @entity6 computer systems to protect @entity23 from @entity6 military action , he has very likely massively failed at his own purpose			1
the leak makes military conflict between @entity23 and the @entity6 more likely , not less			1
the leak has changed the political equation in ways that reduce the restraint on @entity6 policy			0
public opinion in all @entity6 - allied countries can now see that the dread of the @entity23 nuclear program is not some artificial emotion whipped up by @entity28 , but a widespread fear among @entity33 and @entity125 governments			1
it 's @entity23 's @entity128 neighbors who have begged most urgently that the @entity6 hit @entity23 's nuclear sites			1
@entity23 recklessness and duplicity has been widely publicized -- as has @entity23 's contemptuous rejection of all diplomatic approaches			2
president @entity135 's hand has been strengthened inside the @entity6			0
members of @entity137 can see the intimate details of the administration 's determined effort to restrain @entity23 by peaceful means			0
and they can see in equally intimate detail that the effort has failed , and failed entirely because of @entity23 's obduracy			0
if any doubt remains that a nuclear @entity23 would massively destabilize the region , @entity4 alleviates it : it 's there in black and white , according to @entity28 sources , that @entity149 would seek a nuclear weapon			1
and it 's a good question whether an increasingly anti-western @entity54 would likely soon pursue a nuclear weapon too			0
i am not saying that a @entity6 attack on @entity23 has suddenly become likely			1
just that it has become more politically feasible than it was 72 hours ago			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity157 .			0

@entity157 : @entity4 release of diplomatic cables will embarrass many
he says cables show @entity33 nations have grave concerns about @entity23 nuclear *capability*
@entity168 : *disclosures* make @entity6 military action against @entity23 more feasible
