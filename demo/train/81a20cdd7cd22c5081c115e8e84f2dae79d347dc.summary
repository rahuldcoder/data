@entity0 -- president @entity2 told @entity5 @entity4 leaders tuesday he plans to stand firm on the part of his $ 825 billion economic recovery plan that calls for tax rebates for nearly all working @entity9 -- including those who make too little to owe income taxes			1
president @entity2 has pledged to work with @entity5 on his economic stimulus package			1
according to two @entity5 aides familiar with @entity2 's @entity18 meeting , rep. @entity13 , @entity14 , the ranking member on the @entity15 , asked @entity2 if there was room for negotiation on the structure of the biggest tax cut in the bill			1
" feel free to whack me over the head because i probably will not compromise on that part , " the president replied , according to one of the aides , who requested anonymity because the member of @entity30 relaying information to the aide from inside the meeting wished to remain anonymous			1
@entity2 supports the tax rebates for those who do n't pay income taxes because they do pay payroll taxes for @entity40 and @entity41			1
" the president said again that people that pay payroll tax are taxpayers , " @entity4 spokesman @entity42 said later			1
" ... and he just mentioned that the notion that refundability of tax credits for those that do n't make a lot of money was a principle that not only he holds , but one that @entity49 held with the @entity50 in the ' 80s			2
" @entity2 came to the @entity18 for meetings with @entity62 senators and representatives hoping to bridge @entity0 's gaping partisan divide and find common ground in the face of a slumping economy			2
while the unusual personal interaction between a president of one party and rank - and - file members of the other was warmly received on both sides of the aisle , the meetings ended with little promise of serious compromise or change on the core issue of how best to spark new economic growth			2
the president first met with @entity4 republicans and then with the @entity62 caucus			2
" we had a wonderful exchange of ideas , and i continue to be optimistic about our ability to get this recovery package done to put people back to work , " @entity2 said after leaving the meeting with @entity62 @entity4 members			1
" there are some legitimate philosophical differences " between @entity94 and @entity5 on how to stimulate the economy , @entity2 noted , " and i respect that			0
" " i do n't expect 100 percent agreement , " he said			0
" but i hope we can put politics aside			0
" @entity4 minority leader @entity99 , @entity100 , said he believes some members enjoyed the conversation			0
" clearly , there are some differences , [ but ] i look forward to [ working with @entity2 ] to improve this package in the coming days so that it is a package that will work for @entity9 families , small businesses and our overall economy			2
" @entity2 's plan -- the @entity110 -- has been placed on the congressional fast - track			0
@entity113 leaders have said they aim to get the package to @entity2 's desk for enactment by @entity117 , which falls on february 16			1
@entity42 said the meetings tuesday did not " start at zero			0
" " i do n't think today was the beginning or the end , but just part of that process , " he said			0
" i do think there is a genuine sense of -- of cooperation that was involved in the meetings			0
i think we will have @entity5 support for this bill			0
i think you 'll have some when the @entity4 passes this bill , hopefully on wednesday			1
" the @entity5 aides , however , said the vast majority of @entity4 @entity5 are expected to oppose the package wednesday but are optimistic they will secure some of the changes they want after the vote -- either through changes the @entity62 makes or in conference committee after the @entity62 votes on the stimulus			1
the talks are being held against the backdrop of what appears to be a steadily deteriorating economic situation , highlighted by thousands of new private sector job cuts and record low consumer confidence			0
the @entity148 , a @entity149 - based business research group , reported tuesday that its @entity150 fell to 37.7 in january , an all - time low going back to the index 's inception in 1967			0
how much influence the minority @entity62 will have on the final drafting of the stimulus plan is an open question			0
" what we 're watching now as the stimulus package takes shape is the legislative equivalent of the first date : republicans meeting with the new president , sizing him up ; @entity2 deciding whether the @entity62 is serious about working with him , " said @entity166 , @entity1 senior political analyst			1
read what @entity166 says of the ' first date ' " he [ @entity2 ] came to a conclusion early on in his political career that partisan polarization is a large part of the problem , " said a senior @entity2 adviser			1
" both in reality and in the minds of the @entity9 people			0
" one key @entity5 criticism of the stimulus plan is that many of its provisions would not jolt the economy back to life quickly enough			0
the @entity185 late monday evening released its first analysis of the total stimulus package as proposed by @entity94			2
the @entity185 estimates that roughly 64 percent of the $ 825 billion package would be put to use in 2009 and 2010 , assuming a stimulus bill is signed into law in mid-february			1
by contrast , @entity191 , @entity2 's budget director , vowed to congressional leaders last week that 75 percent of the money would be spent within 18 months			1
the question of just how fast states and other agencies can spend money to do things like fix roads and retrofit buildings to make them more energy efficient will remain central to the congressional debate in coming days			0
appearing before reporters tuesday morning , @entity99 applauded @entity2 's planned meeting with congressional @entity5 , but reiterated his belief that the bill , as currently drafted , would significantly add to the debt while failing to spark sufficient job creation			2
the current version of the bill " wo n't stimulate anything except more government and more debt , " said @entity212 rep. @entity211 , another member of the @entity4 @entity62 leadership			1
@entity2 was accompanied on the @entity219 on tuesday by transportation secretary @entity220 , a former moderate @entity62 @entity4 member from the president 's home state of @entity223			1
the administration is hoping that @entity220 , who once was the host of bipartisan congressional dinners with @entity4 chief of staff @entity227 , will be able to help @entity2 win at least some @entity5 in @entity30			1
@entity227 also planned to meet with several @entity4 republicans tuesday night , senior administration officials said			0
@entity2 also extended an olive branch to @entity5 by reportedly helping to remove from the stimulus plan a widely criticized $ 200 million provision to provide contraceptives to low - income families			2
the provision , which @entity5 leaders said would do little to help boost the economy , had been strongly defended by house speaker @entity237			0
@entity1 's @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity243 's @entity242 contributed to this report .			0
