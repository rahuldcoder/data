@entity0 -- a man , struggling to get away , is surrounded by @entity4 police in the middle of a street as a large crowd looks on			1
the officers pull him over to a police van and handcuff his hands , over his head , to the back of the vehicle as he sits on the ground			1
soon , as some in the crowd scream , the van begins to move			0
it slowly picks up speed			0
the helpless man in a red t - shirt is dragged along the road			2
soon , two officers lift him up by the legs , apparently to avoid dragging -- but the police van seems to speed up , and the man 's legs fall to the ground , he is dragged hundreds of feet			1
@entity4 shocked by police shootings at mine though injured , the man was never taken to a hospital , police investigators say			1
he died a few hours after the incident			2

the cases include 648 deaths			0
the @entity63 's human rights report on @entity4 for 2011 , the latest year available , said the country 's " principal human rights problems included police use of lethal and excessive force , including torture , against suspects and detainees , which resulted in deaths and injuries ; vigilante and mob violence ; and prison overcrowding and abuse of prisoners , including beatings and rape by prison guards			1
" but @entity86 was quick to emphasize that in the nation of 50 million people , police who carry out crimes do not reflect the police service as a whole			0
" there are many other officers who are dedicated , who uphold the law and arrest criminals all the time , " he said			0
while authorities have not confirmed the man 's identity , local reports say he was a taxi driver from @entity102			0
the man and the police in the video , as well as those in the crowd , are black , so there is no suggestion that the incident is a sign of white vs. black tensions in the country			1
