-- if we learned that the government was planning to limit our first amendment rights , we 'd be outraged			0
after all , our right to be heard is fundamental to our democracy			0
well , our free speech rights are under assault -- not from the government but from corporations seeking to control the flow of information in @entity12			1
if that scares you as much as it scares me , then you need to care about net neutrality			0
" net neutrality " sounds arcane , but it 's fundamental to free speech			2
the internet today is an open marketplace			1
if you have a product , you can sell it			0
if you have an opinion , you can blog about it			0
if you have an idea , you can share it with the world			0
and no matter who you are -- a corporation selling a new widget , a senator making a political argument or just a @entity31 sharing a funny cat video -- you have equal access to that marketplace			1
an e-mail from your mom comes in just as fast as a bill notification from your bank			0
you 're reading this op - ed online ; it 'll load just as fast as a blog post criticizing it			2
that 's what we mean by net neutrality			0
but telecommunications companies want to be able to set up a special high - speed lane just for the corporations that can pay for it			2
you wo n't know why the internet retail behemoth loads faster than the mom - and - pop shop , but after a while you may get frustrated and do all of your shopping at the faster site			1
maybe the gatekeepers will discriminate based on who pays them more			1
maybe they will discriminate based on whose political point of view conforms to their bottom line			1
we do n't have to speculate			0
we can look to the history of the media gatekeepers for examples			1
back in the 1990s , @entity65 rescinded rules that prevented television networks from owning their own programming			0
network executives swore in congressional hearings that they would n't give their own programming preferred access to the airwaves			0
they vowed access to the airwaves would be determined only by the quality of the shows			0
i was working at @entity79 back then , and i did n't buy that line one bit			1
sure enough , within a couple of years , @entity79 was the largest supplier of its own prime - time programming			1
to take advantage of this new paradigm , @entity85 bought @entity88 , @entity89 ( the parent company of @entity91 ) bought @entity92 and @entity79 merged with @entity93			1
and since these conglomerates owned both the pipes through which @entity12 received information ( in this case , tv networks ) and the information itself ( in this case , tv shows ) , they developed a monopoly over what you could watch			2
today , if you 're an independent producer , it 's nearly impossible to get a show on the air unless the network owns at least a piece of it			0
now @entity112 , the nation 's largest cable provider , and @entity79 / @entity93 want to merge			1
this new behemoth would be able to charge other cable carriers more for @entity79 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and the 35 other cable networks it will own in whole or in part			1
this means that other carriers wo n't be able to afford as many choices -- and it means that your cable bill will go up			0
@entity112 is also the nation 's largest home internet service provider			1
and as more and more of our television is provided through the internet , other internet giants such as @entity131 and @entity132 will have to look toward merging with @entity92 / @entity89 or @entity88 / @entity85			2
we 'll end up with a few megacorporations in control of the flow of information -- not just on tv , but now online as well			1
from my seat on the @entity143 , i plan to do everything i can to stop these mergers or at least put rigorous restrictions on them			2
but if this trend toward media consolidation continues , the free and open internet will be a thing of the past unless we write the principle of net neutrality into law right now			1
this is n't a liberal or conservative issue			2
everyone has a stake in protecting the @entity160			1
and it is n't even strictly a political issue			2
the internet 's freedom and openness has made it a hotbed for innovations that change our lives			0
it 's been an incredible engine of job creation			0
the internet was developed at taxpayer expense to benefit the public interest			0
if we let corporations prioritize some content over others , we 'll lose what makes it so valuable to our economy , our democracy and our daily lives			0
net neutrality may sound like a technical issue , but it 's the key to preserving the internet as we know it -- and it 's the most important @entity160 issue of our time			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of sen. @entity191 .			2

@entity191 : trend of media consolidation will mean end of free and open internet
mergers such as @entity112 - @entity79 / @entity93 would control information flow , senator warns
far from " neutral , " gatekeepers could discriminate on political views , who pays more , he says
@entity191 : this is a *bipartisan* issue ; all have a stake in preserving @entity160
