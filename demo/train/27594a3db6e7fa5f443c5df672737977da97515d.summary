-- the @entity2 hearing on the @entity4 scandal this week upstaged another @entity6 investigation into how @entity8 technology companies shelter earnings from domestic taxes			1
that was just as well , since the real culprit here is n't tax - dodging corporations ; it 's @entity8 's absurd corporate tax code			1
the @entity15 had hoped to make a media splash by landing a big fish rarely seen in @entity18 : @entity20 ceo @entity19			2
it released a 40 - page report on the eve of the hearing , excoriating @entity20 's use of " gimmicks " to avoid paying @entity8 taxes on $ 44 billion in offshore income between 2009 and 2012			1
chaired by sen. @entity29 , @entity30 , the subcommittee has been investigating the tax avoidance strategies of major @entity8 tech firms			2
last year , @entity34 and @entity35 were in the dock ; tuesday , it was @entity20 's turn			1
" @entity20 was n't satisfied with shifting its profits to a low - tax offshore tax haven , " @entity29 told the @entity39			2
" it has created offshore entities holding tens of billions of dollars while claiming to be tax resident nowhere			0
" at issue are foreign subsidiaries that @entity8 multinationals use to manage their overseas operations			0
the subcommittee report says that tech companies can shuffle their intellectual property as well as earnings among such entities to shield them from @entity8 's steep corporate tax rates			1
@entity19 , however , denied that @entity20 funnels any of its @entity8 profits into offshore tax havens			1
the company has amassed more than $ 100 billion in foreign earnings , he said , because international sales of iphones and other products account for 61 % of its revenues			0
@entity20 pays taxes in the countries where its products are sold , he told the panel , adding that it is probably also @entity8 's largest corporate taxpayer , with expected 2013 liabilities of $ 7 billion			1
the @entity6 inquisitors are n't accusing the tech companies of doing anything illegal but of cleverly exploiting loopholes in @entity8 tax laws that allow them to shelter income overseas			2
lawmakers want the firms to " repatriate " their overseas profits so that they can be taxed here			0
but the companies say that would be tantamount to taxing them twice , putting them at a disadvantage with foreign competitors who pay taxes only where their products are sold			0
at a time when @entity8 urgently needs to rebuild its revenue base and continue unwinding its public debts , it 's little wonder that lawmakers cast a covetous eye on the overseas profits of @entity8 firms			2
but while grilling @entity96 may make for good political theater , it does n't get to the heart of the problem : @entity8 's outdated and dysfunctional corporate tax code			1
how flawed is it ? let us count the ways			0
first , it subjects @entity8 - based corporations to a top marginal rate of 35 % , among the highest in the world			1
designed at a time when @entity8 companies competed mainly with each other , the code now hobbles them in global competition			1
second , the code is riddled with special tax deductions , credits and exemptions , which make it both fiendishly complicated and economically inefficient			2
as economist @entity119 noted in a recent @entity121 study , these provisions entail significant administrative and compliance costs and , more damagingly from the standpoint of economic growth , undercut markets ' ability to allocate capital to its most productive uses			0
they also make the code highly inequitable as some companies get breaks while others do n't with little rhyme or reason other than how effective their lobbyists are			2
third , the @entity8 is one of the few remaining countries ( @entity138 ) that has a " worldwide " tax system , meaning that we apply the 35 % top rate to the worldwide profits of @entity8 - based companies : that is , on the profits made by foreign subsidiaries as well			1
almost every other major economy has a territorial tax system , which taxes only the business profits earned in that country			2
while @entity8 companies get a credit for the taxes they pay overseas , they are still liable for the difference between what they pay abroad and the higher @entity8 marginal tax rate			1
these glaring defects have engendered a rare bipartisan consensus in @entity18 for sweeping reform of the corporate tax code			1
the basic idea , endorsed by the @entity163 administration and @entity165 chairman @entity164 , is to radically simplify the code by phasing out special preferences and using some or all of the revenues to cut the tax rate			0
( progress toward reform is snagged , however , on a dispute over whether any of those revenues should be used for deficit reduction			0
) more controversial is adopting a territorial system			0
some progressives are leery of this approach , since it would put the foreign earnings of @entity8 - based companies forever beyond @entity18 's reach			0
but as @entity121 economist @entity182 notes , those foreign profits are already taxed by the countries in which the money is earned			0
in today 's increasingly globalized economy , it makes sense to move toward a simpler system that is easier to enforce			0
unlike @entity20 , @entity8 lawmakers have the power to fix our broken corporate tax system			1
that 's probably a better use of their time than villainizing @entity8 's most innovative and successful companies			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			0

*congressional* committee *strongly* *criticized* @entity20 's handling of taxes
@entity199 : do n't make @entity20 the *scapegoat* for a flawed corporate tax code
he says corporations face world 's highest rate and a dysfunctional system
@entity199 : @entity8 corporate tax code should empower firms in global competition
