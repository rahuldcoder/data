just outside of a white and yellow tent in @entity2 , an elephant heaves a heavy sigh			0
his ears are lowered , his skin relaxed -- his trunk arched into a final pose			0
" that 's my favorite part of the circus , " @entity11 photographer @entity10 said			1
" when there 's a moment , five minutes before ( performers ) get on and five minutes after they get off			1
" peels ' fascination with the circus began as a child			1
her father traveled @entity21 as a one - man show , " @entity25 , " performing at hospitals and amusement parks			1
at 6 years old , @entity10 began helping her father as the magician 's assistant			1
for five years , she watched her father walk a tightrope between being her dad and performing as a magician			2
it 's what the majority of @entity34 ' work focuses on , something she calls " in between worlds			2
" in 2001 , @entity10 traveled to @entity37 to follow and photograph a large ship			1
but instead , she felt a calling to run away with the @entity40			0
starkly different from her father 's small production , the circus boasted multiple tents and more than 100 performers			1
she photographed the show for two weeks			2
at first , she shot the expected -- the splendor of the circus act			0
but it was n't the whimsy on stage that truly appealed to @entity34 ' artistry			0
she became interested in the evolution that occurred behind the curtain			0
her book " @entity56 " binds together roughly 100 photographs taken at several traveling circuses in @entity21			1
the images capture a " glimpse of the hidden life of the performing artist			1
" social media follow @ @entity64 on @entity65 to join the conversation about photography			0
the performers carry a certain melancholy when transitioning in and out of character			0
this is illustrated clearly in @entity10 ' photo of a clown			1
he 's still in costume , his makeup still intact , yet he 's off - stage , no longer part of an act			2
he emanates an " unavoidable authenticity , " @entity10 says			2
peels ' work is heavily influenced by other artwork , specifically 19th - century paintings			0
before photographing every circus , she visits local museums to derive inspiration			0
but the true genius lies in her ability to relate to the performer			0
she finds herself " in between worlds , " too			0
" there 's the home life and the artist life , " @entity10 says			1
as a wife and a mother of two , @entity10 says she struggles to find time to create , and she often seeks solace at artist residencies to focus solely on her work			2
now she 's in @entity100 , @entity11 , the birthplace of @entity101 , in an effort to draw space to become a character of her own			1
" i live in two worlds , " she said			0
" @entity10 is a photographer based in the @entity11			1
