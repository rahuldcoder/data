-- tree poaching conjures up the lawless @entity5 jungle , but @entity7 's magnificent redwood forests now face a piecemeal but steady assault by poachers too , @entity2 officials say			1
thieves are cutting massive chunks from the base of the champion trees , which are the tallest on @entity14 and are up to 2,000 years old			1
while state officials say the damage is far from any @entity5 deforestation , they do rank the desecration alongside elephant tusk poaching			1
under the cloak of darkness , bandits are poaching the burl from the old - growth redwoods in @entity26 in @entity2 , and that lumpy feature from the tree base is then sold for thousands of dollars to make furniture , bowls and even souvenirs , officials say			1
" we 've seen a peaked increase ( of theft and damage ) , " says @entity32 , chief of interpretation and education at the park			0
" unfortunately i feel that it 's more than we can keep track of			2
" @entity32 compares the theft to elephants being killed for their ivory tusks			1
she has been with the parks for three years and has noticed a spike in thefts during her tenure , she said			0
" the distribution goes beyond what we could have imagined			0
there 's a black market for this stuff , and it goes well beyond @entity2 borders , " she said tuesday			1
what makes the poaching so distressing is that the burls are crucial to the survival of the redwoods , whose towering forests block out the sun and draw tourists worldwide			2
when a burl cutting occurs , a lot of the bark is damaged or removed , and that bark is critical to protecting the redwoods from insect infestation and fire because the material is flame - resistant , @entity32 said			2
" when you take away the burl and leave an open scar , it 's similar to me having a major cut on my leg and i left it exposed , " @entity32 explained			1
" now i 'm exposed to other infections			0
" to combat the poachers , officials at @entity26 in northern @entity2 have closed an eight - mile drive through the forests at night			1
the @entity84 said smaller pieces of poached burl can sell for hundreds of dollars , and the larger chunks can fetch thousands			1
taking the burls from a state park is a crime , and their size determines whether the crime is a misdemeanor or felony , the @entity91 district attorney 's office said			2
the burls provide unique and beautiful patterns for coffee tables and bar counter tops , and smaller pieces can be used for knife handles			0
but such a defacement of a forest distresses rangers			0
redwoods are on many ' bucket lists ' the @entity26 comprises 133,000 acres of forest , coastlines , prairies , rivers and streams			2
approximately 40,000 acres are old - growth forest and are a big draw for international visitors who consider a drive through the park a once - in - a - lifetime experience			2
ranger @entity122 , who works in the public information office at the park , receives numerous calls every week asking about the redwoods , located along the @entity2 coast north of @entity127			1
" one of the things i hear a lot is ' seeing the redwoods is on my bucket list , ' " @entity122 said			0
that 's why protecting and preserving these behemoth beauties is a mission that rangers take very seriously at the park , which the @entity138 labels a world heritage site			0
" we 're one of those places that we have around the world that everyone thinks is precious enough , important enough , rare enough , that we need to protect it for the future , " @entity32 said			0
" it 's not just a crime against us as @entity7 ... it 's a crime to everyone			0
" @entity0 's @entity150 and @entity151 contributed to this report .			0
