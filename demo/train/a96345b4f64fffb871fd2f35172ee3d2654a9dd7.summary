@entity5 's defenders made the first of many poor clearances and the striker just accepted the ball outside the @entity16 area to shoot for goal in the bottom corner of the net with a low drive			1
the much - fancied @entity16 were in shock from the early setback and there was an altercation between @entity41 and @entity42 after the goal as they tried to work out who was to blame for the error which allowed @entity1 in			2

@entity52 put a number of shots over the bar and he was joined by attempts by @entity41			0

@entity69 failed to clear the ball from his area and , luckily for the @entity16 , @entity72 found it tough to control the ball and his looped shot hit the bar			0

however , he was ruled to be offside			0
he finally made the breakthrough minutes later			0
as a free kick came in , he had an easy header into the right hand side of the goal from the center of the area as the @entity16 stood like statues			0
however , in an example of how much the game meant to @entity5 , they tried to fashion a last minute comeback and nearly pulled it off			0
@entity18 broke free in injury time with a great low finish through the goalkeeper 's legs to make it 2 - 1 to reignite @entity5 's hopes of saving the game			2
