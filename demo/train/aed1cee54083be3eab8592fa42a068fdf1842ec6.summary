-- @entity1 has been hit by protests during the past few weeks , as the country finds itself split between the rest of @entity5 and @entity6			1
what sparked the protests ? the protests began in november , when @entity1 's president , @entity8 , did a u-turn over a trade pact with the @entity11 that had been years in the making			1
@entity8 refused to sign the agreement , which would have strengthened cooperation with the @entity11 , opting instead for closer ties with neighboring @entity6			1
since november 21 hundreds of thousands of @entity1 have taken to the streets of @entity17 to demand that the @entity11 deal be signed			1
the epicenter of the protest has been in the city ' central @entity21 , known as the @entity23			0
the demonstrations are the biggest the country has seen since the @entity26 which toppled the country 's government nine years ago			1
protesters in @entity1 see the demonstrations as a way of choosing between @entity5 and @entity6			2
@entity0 contributor @entity32 says the stakes are even higher now than they were in 2004 - 05 : " upholding @entity1 independence is a deep concern , not only to the @entity1 , but to all the free countries of @entity5 -- and thus to the @entity38 ... what 's at stake in the streets of @entity17 is the future of the @entity43 continent			0
" why did @entity8 refuse to sign the @entity11 deal ? @entity8 , who has been in power since 2010 , said he could not sign the trade and political association deals with the @entity11 because of @entity1 's " complex economic situation			1
" he said @entity1 could not afford to sign the deal , alluding to economic pressure from @entity6 , which had threatened its neighbor with trade sanctions			2
" the @entity1 government will suspend the negotiations for signing the @entity55 with the @entity11 , until we find a solution for the situation is found and when the drop in industrial production and our relations with @entity63 countries are compensated by the @entity43 market , otherwise our country 's economy will sustain serious damage , " said @entity1 deputy prime minister @entity52 when the @entity11 deal was suspended			1
@entity6 president @entity68 has not publicly admitted pressuring @entity8 into foregoing the agreements , which would have moved @entity1 further from @entity6 's sphere of influence , instead insisting he wants the country 's difficulties to be resolved			1
" i very much hope that all political forces of the country will manage to come to an agreement in the interest of the @entity1 people and solve all the piles of problems , " @entity68 said in his @entity75 address on thursday			0
but as @entity84 , visiting scholar at the @entity5 think tank in @entity86 , wrote in a piece for @entity0 , @entity68 wants to see @entity1 -- and other former @entity89 republics -- brought back into line with @entity6 " through integration into a @entity93 - led customs union which in the future shall be transformed into a fully - fledged ' @entity95 '			2
" another factor in @entity8 's decision not to sign the deal is likely to have been the @entity11 's demands that he free former prime minister @entity100 , his political opponent , from jail			0
@entity6 said thursday december 12 that the @entity11 is trying to bully @entity1 into signing a free trade deal against the wishes of the majority of @entity1			1
" the @entity11 offers a token package , which is not of any interest to the @entity1 government , " @entity105 , head of the @entity106 in @entity6 's @entity107 , told @entity0 's @entity108 , who was sitting in for @entity109			1
@entity100 was found guilty of abuse of office in a @entity6 gas deal two years ago , and sentenced to seven years in prison in a case widely seen as politically motivated			1
on thursday december 12th , the @entity11 's foreign policy chief , @entity117 , spoke to @entity8 and told @entity0 afterwards that he " still wishes to sign the association agreement with the @entity11			0
" @entity105 said he was not so sure			0
" he never actually rejected the possibility of signing a deal with the @entity11 , " he said			0
" but he said on many occasions that he is not happy with the content of the deal			0
" why is @entity1 torn between the @entity11 and @entity6 ? @entity1 is the biggest frontier nation separating @entity6 and the @entity11			1
once part of the @entity89 , the country gained its modern @entity21 in 1991 following the fall of the @entity127			0
since then , @entity1 has made an effort to move towards @entity130 ideals when it comes to politics and human rights , but the nation is still ranked 144th out of 177 countries in @entity137 's corruption index			0
the @entity1 who have taken to the streets in recent weeks say they want to see a better - governed , less corrupt and politically liberal country , more closely aligned with its western neighbours			0
" people see a prosperous , well - governed @entity11 next to their borders -- in sharp contrast with their own economic and political misery , " wrote @entity84 , in his piece for @entity0			0
" that 's why they are on the streets now , in @entity17 and elsewhere			0
" under @entity89 rule , many @entity1 farmers lost their lands and homes , and many ethnic @entity6 settled in the @entity1			2
under @entity89 rules the country 's people their language and culture all suffered			2
" no nation suffered more from @entity89 communism than the @entity1 , " wrote @entity32 in his recent piece for @entity0			0
" @entity1 farmers lost their lands and homes to @entity89 collectivization ... millions died in the man - made famine that followed ... their language and culture were stunted under @entity93 rule ; their intellectuals and writers were suppressed , banished , murdered , and defamed			0
" this caused a split which still exists in the @entity1 today , where a strong east - west divide remains , with the @entity171 of the nation being mostly @entity6 - speaking , with a large ethnic @entity6 population , and the @entity130 of the country being @entity1			1
@entity1 's economy has been slow to follow its western neighbours who were also under @entity89 control -- @entity182 , for example , where the economy has grown exponentially			0
@entity182 was not part of @entity89 , but can say " also part of the @entity89 or under @entity89 control -- for example , @entity182 , where the economy has grown exponentially			0
" by contrast , @entity1 's economy has deteriorated further and has suffered its worst years since the fall of the @entity89			2
. many @entity1 hope that an @entity11 deal would offer the chance of economic recovery			2
why is @entity6 gas a key issue ? @entity1 with a population of over 45 million is heavily dependent on @entity6 gas to keep the country running during its bitterly cold winters			1
its geographic location it is also a key transit country through which gas flows to many countries in @entity5			0
this puts @entity6 in a commanding position -- energy is a lever the @entity6 have used in the past , either by cutting off supplies in mid-winter ( most recently in 2009 ) or by promising price cuts or increases			0
@entity1 , with a population of 45 million , is heavily dependent on @entity6 gas to keep the country running during its bitterly cold winters			1
how does the situation affect the rest of the region ? the @entity130 -- the @entity11 , together with the @entity38 -- has been working on its relations with former @entity216 countries for over two decades , with the aim of restoring democratic rule and improving quality of life for @entity1			1
it views the decision by @entity1 , the largest of the former republics , not to partner up with the @entity11 as bowing to @entity6 pressure			1
@entity1 is something of a pawn between @entity6 and the @entity130			2
for the @entity130 , the deal would mean its reach would spread further east ; by contrast , the @entity6 see the @entity1 as key to holding on to their turf			2
when asked about the situation in @entity1 , @entity6 foreign minister @entity233 insisted it was a " domestic issue " and that it is the prerogative of the government to decide whether to sign the agreement .			1

@entity1 protests are the country 's largest in nine years
the country finds itself split between closer ties with the @entity11 and cooperating more with @entity6
the country is heavily dependent on @entity6 gas , especially during its bitter winters
@entity6 says the situation in @entity1 is a " domestic issue "
