-- a day after @entity3 's rating agency downgraded the @entity5 credit rating to @entity6 + from its top rank of @entity8 , there were more questions than answers saturday about what effects the move will have on the economy and @entity5 consumers			1
the move by @entity3 , one of the leading credit rating agencies , came just days after @entity18 approved a deal to deliver $ 2.1 trillion in savings over the next decade			1
the deal followed heated debt - ceiling talks in @entity23			2
" the downgrade reflects our opinion that the fiscal consolidation plan that @entity18 and the administration recently agreed to falls short of what , in our view , would be necessary to stabilize the government 's medium - term debt dynamics , " @entity3 said friday shortly after markets closed			1
while it was unclear what the short - term impact of the credit rating downgrade would be , some initial answers were expected monday when the stock market reopened			1
one area of concern is whether a downgrade would ward off investors from buying @entity5 debt and increase the country 's cost to borrow money , therefore increasing consumer interest rates on everything from mortgages to car loans to student loans			1
" only time 's going to tell how we 're going to be affected , " former @entity5 comptroller general @entity52 told @entity0			1
" interest rates that affect the @entity5 government ultimately can ripple throughout the economy , which is not good news given our weak economic condition already			1
" rating agencies such as @entity3 , @entity61 's and @entity62 analyze risk and give debt a grade that is supposed to reflect the borrower 's ability to repay its loans			1
the safest bets are stamped @entity8			1
that 's where the @entity5 debt has stood for years			1
@entity61 's first assigned the @entity5 a @entity8 rating in 1917			1
@entity62 and @entity61 's , the other two main credit ratings agencies , maintained the @entity8 rating for the @entity5 after this week 's debt deal , though @entity61 's lowered its outlook on @entity5 debt to " negative			1
" a negative outlook indicates the possibility that @entity61 's could downgrade the country 's sovereign credit rating within a year or two			1
@entity82 , the head of sovereign ratings at @entity3 , told @entity0 that the political brinkmanship over the debt ceiling proved to be a key issue , with " the @entity5 government getting to the last day before they had cash - management problems			1
" few governments separate the budget process from the debt - authorization process as the @entity5 does , he noted			1
and , though the budget deal that finally was reached will deliver at least $ 2.1 trillion in savings over the next decade , that will not suffice , he said			2
" it 's going to be difficult to get beyond that -- at least in the near term -- and you do need to get beyond that to get to a point where the debt - to - gdp ratio is going to stabilize , " he said			2
asked who was to blame , @entity102 said , " this is a problem that 's been a long time in the making -- well over this administration , the prior administration			2
" @entity18 should shoulder some of the blame , he said			0
" the first thing it could have done is to have raised the debt ceiling in a timely manner so that much of this debate had been avoided to begin with , as it had done 60 or 70 times since 1960 without that much debate			0
" @entity102 added that his agency 's decision is likely to have a long - term impact			0
" once you lose your aaa , it does n't usually bounce back , " he said			0
he pointed to the decision by @entity18 about whether to extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts as one crucial area			0
" if you let them lapse for the high - income earners , that could give you another $ 950 billion , " he said			0
@entity132 officials received @entity3 's analysis friday afternoon and alerted the agency to an error that inflated @entity5 deficits by $ 2 trillion , said an administration official , who was not authorized to speak for attribution			1
the agency acknowledged the mistake , but said it was sticking with its decision			0
the administration official called it " a facts - be - damned decision ... their analysis was way off , but they would n't budge			0
" but @entity102 defended his agency 's move			0
" it does n't make a material difference , " he said			0
" it does n't change the fact that your debt - to - gdp ratio , under most plausible assumptions , will continue to rise over the next decade			0
" rumors of a possible downgrade surfaced shortly after @entity160 prime minister @entity159 announced in @entity163 that finance ministers of the @entity166 industrialized nations -- @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity160 , @entity171 and the @entity5 -- may meet " in a few days " to discuss the sagging world economy			1
the announcement came on a day when financial anxiety gripped the globe			0
stock markets worldwide saw intense volatility amid worries of a widening debt crisis in @entity180 and a stalled economic recovery in the @entity5			2
@entity5 markets were dramatically up and down a day after having their worst day since the 2008 financial crisis			2
stock market values fell friday across @entity180 and @entity185 , where reaction to news of the @entity5 credit downgrade was mixed			1
a scathing editorial in the @entity192 state - run @entity190 criticized the @entity5 for living outside its means			2
" @entity192 , the largest creditor of the world 's sole superpower , has every right now to demand the @entity5 to address its structural debt problems and ensure the safety of @entity192 's dollar assets , " the editorial said			2
" to cure its addiction to debts , the @entity5 has to re-establish the common sense principle that one should live within its means			2
" other responses were more measured			0
" we will have to analyze it			0
it will require some time , " said @entity208 's finance minister , @entity207			0
" ( the ) situation is grave and there is no gain in making off - the - cuff remarks			0
" in @entity216 , which also holds a large amount of @entity5 debt , the @entity215 news agency said government officials were closely monitoring financial developments in the @entity5			2
" the news is bad and @entity225 plans to keep very close tabs on how the market reacts , " @entity221 , head of the ministry 's economic policy bureau , told @entity215			0
concerns about debt issues in @entity180 appeared to battle with optimism that a positive @entity5 jobs report indicated the @entity5 economy is not headed into a new recession -- the dreaded " double - dip			1
" " the crisis in @entity180 is quickly becoming on par with the financial crisis of 2008 , " @entity235 , portfolio manager at @entity236 , told @entity237			0
" the jobs report shows that things are n't getting much worse in the @entity5 , but the focus is clearly on @entity180 at this point			2
" " we are going to get through this , " @entity5 president @entity246 said prior to the downgrade at the @entity248 , where he announced a jobs program for veterans			1
" things will get better			0
and we 're going to get there together			0
" @entity246 , who spoke friday afternoon with @entity169 's @entity255 and @entity170 chancellor @entity256 about the crisis , noted that july marked the 17th consecutive month of private - sector job growth in the @entity5 , but said much more work needs to be done			1
@entity246 is urging @entity262 and @entity263 to come together in efforts to strenghten the @entity5 economy , @entity261 press secretary @entity260 said in a statement saturday			1
" the bipartisan compromise on deficit reduction was an important step in the right directionm " @entity260 said			0
" yet , the path to getting there took too long and was at times too divisive			0
we must do better to make clear our nation 's will , capacity and commitment to work together to tackle our major fiscal and economic challenges			2
" @entity0 's @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 , @entity283 and @entity284 contributed to this report .			0
