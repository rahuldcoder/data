@entity0 laughed off @entity3 's announcement of a ceasefire agreement , saying there is no such deal and schoolgirls abducted in april have been converted to @entity8 and married off			1
@entity3 officials announced two weeks ago that they had struck a deal with the @entity12 terror group			1
the deal , the government said , included the release of more than 200 girls whose kidnapping at a boarding school in the nation 's north stunned the world			1
in a video released saturday , the @entity12 group 's notorious leader fired off a series of denials			1
" do n't you know the over 200 @entity29 schoolgirls have converted to @entity8 ? " @entity30 said			2
" they have now memorized two chapters of the @entity33			0
" @entity30 slammed reports of their planned release			2
" we married them off			0
they are in their marital homes , " he said , chuckling			0
the group 's leader also denied knowing the negotiator with whom the government claimed it worked out a deal , saying he does not represent @entity0			1
" we will not spare him and will slaughter him if we get him , " he said of the negotiator			0
it was n't clear when the video was made			2
@entity51 , a government spokesman , said these assertions contradict those made in the group 's talks with the @entity3 government			1
@entity51 said the government will do everything possible to verify the claims made in the video			2
" we 've heard about the video , and we can say the road to peace is bumpy -- and you can not expect otherwise , " @entity51 said			1
" @entity3 has been fighting a war , and wars do n't end overnight			2
" @entity3 said officials met with @entity0 in @entity66 twice during talks mediated by @entity66 president @entity68			1
the ceasefire deal announced on october 17 followed a month of negotiations with representatives of the group , said @entity73 , an aide to @entity3 president @entity74			1
after the deal was announced , the aide said final negotiations on the girls ' release would be completed at a meeting a week later in @entity66			2
that day passed without any signs of the girls			0
@entity0 a growing challenge in the video , @entity30 talked not of peace but of more violence -- promising more " war , striking and killing with gun			1
" this strategy appears to be playing out in parts of @entity3 , where @entity0 fighters have continued deadly attacks on villages despite government claims of a ceasefire			1
more people have been abducted and scores killed in recent weeks , including one attack a day after the ceasefire that left eight dead			0
days later , the @entity12 terror group abducted at least 60 young women and girls from @entity103 villages in northeast @entity3			1
heavily armed fighters left 1,500 naira , or about $ 9 , and kola nuts as a bride price for each of the women abducted , residents said			0
for its part , @entity3 is n't backing down			0
it is stepping up its military campaign against militants and criminals in some parts of the @entity118 nation , @entity3 's defense ministry said saturday			1
the military said its airstrikes and ground operations have repelled attacks against civilians in @entity124 and @entity125 , two states in the northeast that have been strongholds and frequent targets for @entity0			0
officials are " studying " the latest video , even as the military continues to recognize the talks aimed at assuring the release of the kidnapped schoolgirls , the ministry said			2
@entity0 , whose name translates to " @entity146 education is sin " in the @entity149 language , is trying to impose strict @entity140 law across @entity3 , which is split between a majority @entity142 north and a mostly @entity103 south			1
like @entity150 , it has ambitions for a caliphate , or religious state			0
the group 's attacks have intensified in recent years in an apparent show of defiance for the nation 's military onslaught			0
its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the government			0
as part of its insurgency , it has bombed schools , churches and mosques , kidnapped women and children , and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike			0
