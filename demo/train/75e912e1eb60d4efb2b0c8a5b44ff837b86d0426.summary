@entity0 -- @entity4 women 's national football team will square off against favorites the @entity6 sunday in their first appearance in a @entity9 final			1
regardless of the result , @entity4 's surprise progress in @entity11 is a much - needed boost for a country recently devastated by massive tremors and a subsequent tsunami			2
it is also putting women 's sport in the shop window like never before			2
" this is a breath of fresh air , because everything out of @entity4 has been negative over the last few months , " said @entity20 , a youth soccer instructor in @entity4 for over 25 years and former soccer instructor of starter @entity22			1
" now , you turn on every channel and there are big segments about women 's soccer ... it 's huge for women 's sports here			2
" can @entity9 spark women 's soccer surge ? known as @entity35 -- or beautiful flower in @entity4 -- the women 's national team has been the underdog throughout this year 's tournament			1
they are unlikely to relinquish this role in sunday 's final in @entity43 , with a star - studded and battle tested @entity6 squad -- which took home the cup in 1991 and 1999 -- standing in their way			0
but what many people may not know , @entity20 said , is that the @entity4 squad has enjoyed a high level of success on the international scene over the last 20 years			2
in addition to their fourth - place showing at the @entity59 , @entity35 has appeared in each of the six women 's @entity60 since 1991 , and are coming off a recent win at the @entity63 held in @entity64 , @entity65			1
yet their success has not had a significant impact on the women 's game generally in @entity4			1
" women 's soccer is grossly underfunded , " said @entity20 , who once played in @entity4 's professional soccer league			1
" it was n't until five or six years ago that the @entity4 @entity74 ( @entity75 ) got together and decided to put more resources behind women 's soccer			1
" he added that recent success from @entity4 's national team has not increased the number of young girls interested in playing organized soccer			1
there are just 25,000 girls registered to play youth soccer in @entity4 , a country of more than 125 million people , @entity20 said			1
this compares to around 200,000 girls registered with the @entity90 in the @entity91 of @entity92 alone			2
so why are @entity4 women enjoying such a successful period ? " it 's not like @entity95 , where you play soccer from the summertime until @entity99 , " @entity20 said			1
" in @entity4 , you play 365 days a year and you play only one sport			0
and you train and train until you fall down			0
" but the culture of sport in @entity4 is far different that in the @entity6 , @entity20 said			0
women 's youth soccer in the @entity6 , especially for girls under 12 , is " purely recreational , " he said			1
in @entity4 " they are already trying to find who can be on the national team at the age of 12			2
" watching the final game ? send us video of your viewing parties			0
unlike the @entity6 women 's professional @entity116 , @entity4 's @entity115 is non-professional			1
in fact , many of the league 's players work normal day jobs to pay their bills			0
" @entity22 [ @entity124 ] and some of the other players from the team are from @entity127 , a hot spring town			0
a lot of those women work in the hot spring resort hotels during the day , after the job they go and train , " said @entity20			0
@entity135 , a sports writer for the @entity136 , an @entity137 newspaper in @entity4 , said the success of the women 's national soccer team has reinvigorated a nation plagued by recent tragedy			1
" the women take a lot of pride in the fact that everything is staked against them , " he said			0
" looking at @entity11 and @entity147 -- the last two teams they beat -- those teams are among the best in the world ... that is a source of inspiration for the country			0
" the time difference with @entity11 has made watching this year 's @entity9 difficult for many @entity4 fans , and the final match -- broadcast at 3:15 a.m. in @entity4 -- is no different			1
nonetheless , diehard @entity35 fans are expected to crowd @entity161 's sports bars , cheering on their ladies as they reach for history			0
" i 'm so happy			0
i was moved very much that @entity35 played such a great game , " one @entity4 male fan told @entity1 , following the team 's semifinals win against @entity147			2
" i want @entity35 to let us dream again at the final game			0
" for @entity20 , a @entity174 - native , the outcome of sunday 's @entity6 - @entity4 final is less important than the buzz @entity35 has already generated in @entity4 about women 's sport			1
" it 's going to lift the whole nation if they win the @entity9 , " @entity20 said			0
" even if they do n't , the fact that they got to the final has had a residual effect in @entity4 ... winning it would just be the icing on the cake			0
" @entity1 's @entity188 and @entity189 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity4 women 's national soccer team is also known as @entity35 -- or beautiful flower in @entity4
