-- four members of the @entity4 @entity3 movement @entity2 have been indicted in the 2005 assassination of former prime minister @entity6 , a high - placed source in the @entity7 confirmed on thursday			1
the @entity8 issued the indictments , and a @entity11 source familiar with the body said the people include alleged perpetrators on the ground			1
multiple sources in the region said they include @entity18			2
@entity18 -- who is the brother - in - law of @entity19 , a former @entity2 commander who was assassinated in @entity20 in 2008 -- is reported to be a member of @entity2 's advisory council			1
the other names on the list are @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			0
two additional lists of indictments are expected later this summer and are expected to include the organizers and planners of the attack , the @entity11 source said			1
the @entity11 and the @entity4 negotiated an agreement on the establishment of the tribunal , based at the @entity37			0
many @entity4 believe the killing revolved around the controversies over @entity20 's role in @entity4 , occupied at the time by @entity20 troops , and the @entity45 government 's strong political influence in @entity4			0
people believe @entity6 wanted the @entity20 to withdraw from @entity4 and lessen @entity20 's influence , and many suspect that @entity20 and its ally @entity2 went after @entity6 because of his stance on this issue			1
those suspected connections of @entity2 and the @entity20 government to the killing have raised tensions in the country , stoking fears of sectarian conflict erupting in the ethnically and religiously diverse nation , which endured a civil war from 1975 to 1990			1
besides being prime minister of @entity4 for 10 years between 1992 and 2004 , @entity6 was the driving force behind @entity64 's renaissance as a @entity66 jewel , investing in the restoration of a city center that not so long before had been the frontline in @entity4 's civil war			1
@entity6 was 60 when he was killed , a self - made @entity71 billionaire of humble origins			1
his son @entity73 , 40 , leads a political bloc known as " march 14 , " which includes prominent @entity77 leaders			0
the group 's adversaries include @entity2 and other factions			1
@entity20 had thousands of troops in @entity4 and great influence in the country until mass protests after @entity6 's assassination forced their withdrawal			1
@entity20 has denied any involvement in the assassination			0
but six years later , the shadow cast by that day still hangs over @entity4 , which finds itself in a political crisis -- in part caused by the bitter divide over the country 's special tribunal that is tasked with investigating @entity6 's assassination			1
@entity2 is a political faction in @entity4 and provides social services to @entity3 , but it has long been regarded as a terrorist organization by the @entity98 and as an ally of @entity100			1
it has had longstanding animosity toward the tribunal , based on the expectation that some of its members would be indicted as conspirators in @entity6 's assassination			1
the @entity2 leader , @entity107 , has accused the group 's arch - enemy @entity110 of the assassination			2
the movement , which fought a war on @entity4 soil against @entity110 five years ago , claims the tribunal is a plot involving the @entity98 , @entity110 and @entity117			0
@entity118 , a @entity2 media relations officer , said it had no immediate reaction to the indictments			1
@entity6 and 22 others were killed on february 14 , 2005 , when a bomb went off as his motorcade passed by			1
@entity124 , @entity6 's son and a former @entity4 prime minister , said on thursday the indictments were issued after years " of patience and waiting and a constant national struggle			1
" @entity124 called on all factions to accept @entity4 's " obligations " to the tribunal and said on thursday " there is no excuse for anyone to escape from this responsibility			0
" " today , we witness a distinctive historic moment in the life of @entity4 's political , judicial security , and ethical systems			0
and i feel in the beat of my heart , the embrace of all the hearts of the @entity4 who defended the cause of justice and refused to bargain on the blood of the martyrs , " @entity124 said in a statement			0
earlier this year , @entity2 brought down @entity124 's government			2
his replacement is prime minister @entity152 , a @entity71 political independent who was backed by @entity2 and its allies			2
@entity107 said in january that @entity2 nominated @entity152 to form " a national salvation government in which parties from across the political spectrum would take part			2
" he disputed the view that @entity152 is a @entity2 figure			2
he said @entity152 is a consensus candidate and " we will not lead the new government and it will not be the government of @entity2			2
" speaking on tv on friday , @entity152 said the " delicate situation " @entity4 is experiencing " requires us to be wise " and avert civil strife			0
he stressed that the " indictments -- no matter what their source is -- are not sentences , and that charges need to have compelling evidence , away from any doubt , and that everyone is presumed innocent until proven guilty			2
" the @entity11 - backed court said the indictment and accompanying arrest warrants " were transmitted to the @entity4 authorities " on thursday			0
it said the announcement " follows a declaration by the @entity4 authorities that they have received a confirmed indictment			0
" " this is not a verdict of guilt and any accused person is presumed innocent unless his or her guilt is established at trial , " the @entity182 said in a statement			0
" at this time , the @entity8 has no comment on the identity or identities of the person or persons named in the indictment			0
indeed , @entity196 has ruled that the indictment shall remain confidential in order to assist the @entity4 authorities in fulfilling their obligations to arrest the accused			0
" the tribunal says arrest warrants have been submitted to the @entity4 authorities , and that they must inform the tribunal president " within 30 days after the confirmation of the indictment of the measures the state has taken to arrest the person ( s ) named in the indictment			0
" @entity0 's @entity210 contributed to this report			0
