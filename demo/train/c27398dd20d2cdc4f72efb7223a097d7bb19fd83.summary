-- it was described by evangelical pastor @entity2 as " obscene trash			2
" high schools and public libraries banned it , while teenagers -- male and female -- hid it under their beds like a dirty magazine			2
women across the country passed it to their friends , their sisters , their neighbors			1
they read chapters about rape in closets with flashlights			2
they gaped in dorm rooms at the photos of childbirth			2
the landmark women 's health handbook was filled with sometimes graphic information about the most intimate aspects of women 's lives			1
it was revolutionary in its candid discussions -- and depictions -- of the specifics of sex , birth control , childbirth , lesbianism and other formerly taboo topics			1
in 1971 , the first " @entity42 " book sold 250,000 copies			1
today , it is available in 25 languages and has sold more than 4 million copies			1
it 's hard to believe it all began in @entity49 with just 12 women			1
they met during a women 's liberation conference in 1969			1
at the time , fewer than 10 % of doctors were women , and topics like sexuality , pregnancy and abortion were rarely discussed			1
but a long conversation after a workshop on women and their bodies prompted this small group to launch the beginning of the women 's health care movement			1
" many of them had had very bad experiences around their health and medical care , around their encounters with physicians , " " @entity42 " executive director @entity65 remembered			1
" you lived in an era then where , if you went to a physician , and you were a married woman , and you ( were diagnosed with ) gonorrhea , your physician would tell your husband and not you			2
" the next year , their work came to fruition : a 193 - page booklet printed on newsprint titled " women and their bodies " that sold for just 75 cents			1
" part of why ( the booklet ) got off the ground is because women wanted to change this kind of environment in which what women had to say , where what women reported about their own experiences , could be so readily discarded , " @entity65 said			1
in august , @entity93 named " @entity42 " one of the best nonfiction books since 1923			1
this year , the organization behind the book , the @entity42 , celebrates its 40th anniversary with a new edition			1
@entity65 was the youngest member of the 1971 editing team and still plays a big part in editing the text			1
@entity65 spoke with @entity0 about the controversial book , the strides in women 's health care since then and the one thing she hopes readers take away			1
the following is an edited version of that interview : @entity0 : describe yourself in the early 1970s			2
what were you doing , and what were you wearing ? @entity65 : in the early ' 70s , i was just out of college			2
the year after i graduated ... i lived on a farm as part of a small commune and learned a tremendous amount about organic gardening			2
this is before it came in vogue			2
i met through mutual friends the women who had produced the newsprint edition of " our bodies , @entity42			1
" i was acutely aware of the lack of good information out there for women of all ages , so i was very excited about being a part of this effort			1
you ca n't ask me what i wore , because i ca n't remember			2
... i probably had a bell bottom or two in those days			0
@entity0 : what were some of the most controversial issues covered in the first book ? @entity65 : well , there 's no question about that			1
i would say there were three things that drew fire from various sources			0
one is the lesbian chapter ; it was called then " in @entity151 they call us dykes			0
" that was obviously going to be very controversial because there was huge resistance to the idea of homosexuality			0
when people tried to ban the book in schools , they often pointed to this chapter as " filthy trash			1
" the second , of course , is the abortion chapter ( which was still illegal at the time ) ... and the third -- can you guess ? -- it 's masturbation			1
that was singled out in the sexuality chapter as one of the sections that was inappropriate , pornographic , you name it			0
@entity0 : " @entity42 " was definitely known as a feminist book in the 1970s			1
do you still identify with that ideology ? @entity65 : there is no question in our minds that it 's a feminist book			1
but one of the problems that has emerged over the last several years or so is that members of the media have failed to educate themselves about what feminism means , so there 's been a lot of distortion			0
( the term ) has different definitions depending on who you talk to			0
one of the things we hope is that by having people read a book like this , which is feminist but is not anti-male ... is that they 'll adjust their thinking about what feminism consists of			1
@entity0 : how has society 's view on women 's health changed since the first book came out ? @entity65 : there were three things that kept hitting us between the eyes : sexism , paternalism , condescension -- things that really interfered with getting good health and medical care			1
there was also a lack of good data			0
much medical care was driven by convention			0
... there are many , many examples of where the medical care was not good or appropriate for the situation			0
( to get where we are today ) has taken better research , it 's taken a strong advocacy community , and it 's taken reaching out to the general public			0
@entity0 : what are the biggest issues facing women today ? @entity65 : we still have a long way to go			1
if you do n't deal with things like education and housing , access to health care , these are critical issues that ultimately have a profound impact on women 's health and well - being			1
the single greatest influence on a woman 's health and well - being is her poverty status			0
... if you look at surveys across the globe , many women identify violence as the biggest threat			2
so that 's not often fully appreciated			0
most of the issues we write about are not just about a single person dealing with an individual choice ; it 's really connected to a larger reality where we can , if we take action , do something to reduce the problem to begin with			0
@entity0 : what 's new in this year 's edition of the book ? @entity65 : the new book has a focus on sexual and reproductive health across the lifespan			2
there 's a whole chapter on gender identity and sexual orientation			0
many chapters are totally redone incorporating new awareness , new activism			0
the perimenopause chapter is totally different			0
the politics chapter is totally different ... with a much more in - depth discussion of health care reform			0
the sexuality chapter includes a wiki conversation ; i think more than 200 people contributed to a several month - long conversation that was then synthesized into this fabulous collection of insights and exchanges			0
@entity0 : why did you decide to focus on just sexual and reproductive health ? @entity65 : well , you 're going to laugh			0
the book was becoming too encyclopedic , and we also wanted to return to earlier versions where we had more space for women 's experiences and stories			1
so that was one of the reasons			0
but in the end , we got so much good content			0
... it ended up being longer than the last book in 2005			2
it 's not something you 're going to carry around with you ; it 's more than 3 pounds			0
@entity0 : with so much information out there and varying opinions on almost everything , how do you edit the book to ensure that it 's unbiased ? @entity65 : well , everybody has a point of view , and everybody has a bias			2
there 's no question that that exists , whether we try hard to keep it out or not			0
one of the ways we ( try ) is by having people with different biases go at the same text , making their case with one another			0
@entity0 : with all the @entity336 resources out there , what 's the purpose of owning a comprehensive book like this ? @entity65 : i talk on about 60 college campuses a year , and you wo n't believe the misinformation young people have			2
this is one of the ironies that we face now			0
there are more and more sources of information			0
... it 's out there to find , but you have to know where to look			0
there 's tremendous amounts of misinformation , distorted information			0
that 's one of things about this book : it 's probably the most trustworthy source about women and health out there			1
@entity0 : what 's one thing you hope women take away from the book ? @entity65 : i would say that we can all make more intelligent decisions about personal health and medical care as well as the policies we want to see in our communities			1
the key is finding reliable sources of information that will guide those kinds of decisions .			0
