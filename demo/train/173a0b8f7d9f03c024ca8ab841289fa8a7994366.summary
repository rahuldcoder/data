-- it was n't the pollster 's fault			1
sure , it would be an understatement to say that @entity7 's surprising loss tuesday night to relatively unknown tea party candidate @entity8 did not reflect the internal polls that had the @entity11 majority leader ahead by more than 30 points			1
but it was n't necessarily @entity16 pollster @entity15 's fault			1
he does n't deserve the withering attacks he 's come under by those who sit safely on the sidelines of actual real campaign work			1
he should n't bear the slings and arrows of those , thanks to 24 - hour cable news , who have become paid pundits on the subject of politics and campaigns without ever being part of one			2
now do n't worry , i 'm not letting @entity15 or @entity16 pollsters off the hook			2
you see , polling is hard			1
i 've done it for the @entity39 under chairman @entity40 crafting the 50 - state strategy , two successful presidential campaigns , and scores of state and local ones , too			2
it 's hard because we are always chasing a moving target			1
in this case , the trouble was those " likely voters			1
" what 's a " likely voter , " you might ask ? well the textbook says it is someone who has a history or pattern of voting in a particular election -- presidential , state assembly , @entity64 party primary , etc. if you have voted in , say , two of the last three presidential elections , the conventional wisdom says you are a likely voter and you get plugged into our universe if we are looking for voters in the presidential year			1
however that does n't make you necessarily a likely voter in , say , the mayor 's race next month , and certainly not in the congressional primary election next week			1
typically , more than half the eligible voters skip the midterm elections every two years			1
the percentage who vote in primaries is often less than one - third			2
and do n't even get me started on caucuses ( love ya ' , @entity84 )			2
as pollsters , we look for patterns			2
we figure that , considering how low @entity90 voter turnout is compared to most other @entity92 democracies , it is safe to bet that if you 've had multiple opportunities to vote and you have n't done it so far , you probably wo n't			2
now that holds fairly true unless there is something different going on out there			2
like the tea party movement			2
or a big - eared , charismatic , black guy with a @entity103 - sounding name from @entity104			1
when the conventional rhythm of politics has been altered , all hell can break loose			1
when that dynamic shifts , the textbook is useless -- and so are our likely voter assumptions			1
so getting locked into seeing the world only one way -- particularly if it is how you want to see it -- instead of how it actually is can be dangerous for a pollster			0
which brings me to @entity16 pollsters			0
in 2012 , so many of them had @entity123 winning convincingly -- he did n't , by the way -- because they failed to sense or hear the dynamic changing rhythm of a younger , more diverse @entity90			0
they built their polling models on the pillars of sand ( ok , it was really , really white , sand ) of a 1980s electorate			1
they bet on the white - male - likely - voting universe of the @entity137 era			0
they simply failed to see the throngs of younger and minority adults as likely voters in 2012			1
they failed to see that african - americans would , for the first time in history , actually become the largest most - likely voter bloc in the general election			0
it was unfathomable for so many @entity16			0
the @entity151 candidacy and what it symbolized dramatically altered the archaic rhythm of politics on both sides			0
it energized those that the textbook said were not politically engaged			0
hope and change rewrote the textbook			0
which brings me back to the shocking primary election results in @entity165 's 7th congressional district tuesday night			2
@entity7 , the second-most powerful member of the @entity11 , vastly outspent his opponent			1
he had not just the backing of the @entity16 establishment , but was on its board of trustees			0
but he lost to a second - tier @entity173 challenger			0
and , because of @entity151 , no one saw it coming			0
the change that united and drove the politics of hope on the left also awakened the politics of anger on the right			0
what @entity151 represents in the @entity184 has led to an uprising on both sides of the political spectrum			0
the textbook had been rewritten , and few bothered to get the new edition			0
so , with all due respect , @entity7 did n't drop a 34 - point lead because of a single issue like immigration or incumbents or @entity195 meddling in his primary			1
it just does n't work that way			0
in fact , polling in the district on june 10 -- the day of the primary -- showed almost nine out of 10 respondents said fixing our immigration system is important ( 84 % important , 57 % very ) , including a majority of @entity16 ( 58 % ) who say it 's very important			1
so for those who simply prefer to place the blame for the majority leader 's loss on immigration , pointing to his failure to pass immigration reform would be safer ground			2
suggesting it was @entity8 's ranting about @entity7 's inability or failure to kill bipartisan immigration reform just is n't credible in a district with 72 % of its voters , including a majority of @entity16 , favoring reform			1
in reality , it 's far more likely that this 34 - point lead never really existed in the first place			1
the changing dynamics of @entity90 politics brought on by the election of president @entity151 has changed the calculus for pollsters on both sides			0
@entity151 's song that tells a story of changing @entity90 makes some hopeful that those who were never part of that @entity137 - era likely - voter equation are now creating new math. at the same time , it hits a very sour note among others , bringing them out to voice their anger at the entire body politic			2
in the @entity151 era , pollsters have to deal with a tumultuous electorate that is increasingly difficult to predict using conventional models			2
or end up looking very , very wrong			0
@entity7 's campaign really should have detected the rumblings of revolt long before election night			1
his loss was likely due ultimately to angry voters on the right who had not before been engaged in the primary process saying in one clear voice , " anyone but @entity7 ! " remember , no one thought shutting down the government was a good idea except the tea party			1
they do n't do moderation			0
compromise is a dirty word			0
so anyone who would consort with the enemy -- like they saw @entity7 as doing in even considering a deal with @entity151 -- just had to go			1
@entity7 did n't lose a 34 - point advantage			1
he never had one in the first place			0
he never had a 34 - point advantage because figuring out who is a likely voter in these tumultuous times is growing increasingly difficult			0
@entity151 has stoked strong emotions on both sides of the political spectrum in an unprecedented way , challenging our conventions about who will and wo n't vote			0
now , come the november midterm , i 'm betting younger people and minorities will leave convention scratching its head again			0
join us on @entity294 / @entity293 .			0

@entity296 says @entity7 's polling was off , but likely voters were off , too
@entity296 : shifts in *demographics* and polarization helped to dislodge conventional wisdom
@entity7 probably never really had the big lead he thought he had , says @entity296
