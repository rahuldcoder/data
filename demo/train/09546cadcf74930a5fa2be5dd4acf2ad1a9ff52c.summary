-- with the departure of the last @entity5 combat brigade from @entity6 , the @entity2 administration has taken a large stride toward its goal of complete @entity5 military withdrawal from @entity6 by the end of next year			1
and there are many other signs of progress			0
the rate of @entity6 civilian deaths in political violence has fallen by 90 percent from its awful peak in 2006 , before " the surge " in @entity5 forces and strategy began to roll back the insurgent challenge			1
@entity5 military deaths in @entity6 have fallen to 46 so far this year , by far the lowest level since the @entity5 invasion in march 2003 , and again a 90 percent decline from the pace of casualties in 2007			1
in march of this year , @entity6 held the most democratic election any @entity30 country has held in a generation ( with the possible exception of @entity33 )			2
unfortunately , however , the new milestone in @entity5 military disengagement from @entity6 comes at a moment when the country is starting to slip backward on both the political and security fronts			1
since the march 7 parliamentary election results were announced , the country 's major political alliances have remained hopelessly deadlocked on the formation of a new coalition government			1
despite months of negotiations and repeated imploring from high - level @entity5 government officials , @entity6 's major leaders and parties remain unable to agree on who should be prime minister or how power should be shared			1
as @entity6 staggers on essentially without a government , electricity and other services remain sporadic , economic reconstruction is delayed and terrorist violence is once again filling the breach			0
in the deadliest single incident in months , at least 48 people died and more than 140 were injured on tuesday when a suicide bomber struck outside an army recruiting center in downtown @entity61			0
as the @entity5 troops withdraw , @entity6 is also losing top government officials , judges and police officers to a rising pace of targeted assassinations			1
all of this has the familiar signature of @entity70 in @entity6 , although it is difficult to attribute responsibility among the shadowy web of insurgent groups			0
complicating the political impasse are deep continuing divisions along sectarian lines			0
@entity6 's @entity79 @entity30 minority -- which ruled under @entity80 but was marginalized in the wake of his downfall -- bet heavily on the electoral process this time , in marked contrast to the first parliamentary election in 2005			1
but the @entity79 were the main group affected when more than 400 parliamentary candidates were disqualified earlier this year for alleged @entity88 ties			0
now they feel doubly aggrieved in that the political alliance they overwhelmingly supported in march -- former prime minister @entity92 's @entity91 -- is being blocked from leading the new government , even though it finished a narrow first in the voting			0
the obstacle to a political solution in @entity61 is not only the pair of @entity100 - dominated political lists ( including that of prime minister @entity102 , who finished second in the vote ) , but , it is widely believed , the @entity104 , which can not abide an @entity6 prime minister over whom it does not exercise substantial leverage			0
indeed , the only two interests that benefit from @entity6 's drift are @entity70 in @entity6 and the hardliners in @entity104			1
president @entity2 deserves more than a little sympathy as he confronts this thorny situation			0
although he opposed the war in @entity6 , he essentially accepted the @entity116 administration 's measured timetable for @entity5 military drawdown			1
particularly at a time when the budget deficit is soaring and the war in @entity121 demands more military and financial resources , @entity2 and most other @entity5 would like to be out of @entity6 completely by yesterday			2
but accelerating or even completing the timetable for @entity5 military withdrawal in @entity6 may only compound the gathering crisis there , for two reasons			2
first , as the recent spike in violence is meant to suggest , it is not yet clear that @entity6 's security forces are even close to being able to handle the country 's security on their own			1
privately , most @entity6 political actors ( @entity79 , @entity100 and @entity135 ) would like to see some sort of continued @entity5 military presence well beyond 2011			1
many worry not only about @entity6 's internal security but also about growing @entity104 dominance once the @entity5 is completely gone			1
and second , @entity5 political influence declines markedly as the @entity5 military presence phases out			0
the worst thing the @entity5 could do at the moment is to take @entity6 for granted			2
the @entity2 administration has had the right instinct in trying to press for and facilitate a political breakthrough in @entity61 , but more needs to be done and soon , while the @entity5 still retains significant leverage			0
the situation may now require the designation of a high - level @entity5 official or envoy to devote sustained attention to the stalemate in @entity6 , while working closely with high - level representatives from the @entity156 and the @entity157			2
such combined diplomatic leverage and mediation broke a dangerous political stalemate in @entity6 in 2005 and might help again			0
one thing should be clear			0
no matter what one may think of the original decision to invade @entity6 ( which i still believe was a mistake ) , @entity6 has come too far and the @entity5 has paid too dearly to now stand by and watch it sink back needlessly into chaos			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			0

@entity169 says there are signs of progress in @entity6
however , he says , the country is slipping backward on political , security fronts
@entity6 's major leaders , parties unable to agree on how to share power
as @entity5 troops leave , @entity6 is also losing top government officials , judges to assassinations
