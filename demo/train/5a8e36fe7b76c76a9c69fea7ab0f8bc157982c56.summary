-- @entity1 has long been rumored to play a character in @entity3 ' rapidly expanding @entity5 movie universe			1
in a surprising revelation happening days before the yearly @entity7 known as @entity8 , @entity1 appeared to confirm his participation in the @entity5 franchise			1
" @entity5 and i have been talking for a couple of years now , " said the @entity12 star , clearly excited to talk about anything besides @entity12			2
" there 's a character out there that we 're gon na announce really soon , that i 'm gon na play			0
" @entity0 : ' @entity20 ' movie to follow ' @entity22 / @entity21 ' in 2018 " announce really soon " could mean " at @entity8 " or it could mean " in the next year " or it could mean " actually never			0
" but what 's even more interesting is that @entity1 appeared to confirm specifically which character he 'd be playing			1
after first explaining that he would not be playing @entity28 -- even though he badly wanted to incarnate the @entity30 version of the emerald superhero -- @entity1 notes that he 's playing someone with " the power of @entity21			1
" he concludes : " just say the word			0
that 's all i 'm gon na say			0
" @entity0 : @entity3 superhero release schedule reportedly released : we 've got thoughts " @entity41 " is a clue ; so is " just say the word			2
" as comic book fans know , the character originally known as @entity43 essentially has @entity21 - level abilities -- abilities that are activated when he says the word " @entity47 ! " so did the @entity48 just offer a clear tease that he 'll be donning some version of @entity43 's red - and - yellow outfit ? if so , it 's likely that the film will feature some kind of @entity57 twist : in the original comics , @entity43 is the grown - up alter ego of young @entity43			0
so the search is on for someone who can believably play a younger version of @entity1			2
@entity3 had no official comment when contacted by @entity0 , although it 's worth pointing out that there is a rumored @entity47 movie on the horizon for 2016			1
watch @entity1 in the video below , inadvertently providing us with further proof that @entity71 has become the @entity72 , just like the @entity73 , or whatever @entity5 's version of the @entity75 is			1
