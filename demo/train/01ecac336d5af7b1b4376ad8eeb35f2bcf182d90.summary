@entity0 -- it took two teenage suicide cases due to school bullying last year in @entity5 for people to notice something was very wrong			1
the students lived in different cities and went to different schools , but both jumped to their deaths after saying they could not take the pain of being bullied any longer			2
over the last few weeks , the country 's media has been filled with reports about tragic cases of school bullying			1
this week , two more students from the same class reportedly took their own lives -- one was the victim of bullying , the other a powerless friend who had stood by and watched the abuse			1
experts say the cases highlight how desperately many @entity5 teenagers need a means to escape the bullying as well as a way to cope			1
@entity32 - wool , a 17 - year - old high - school student , said he has been bullied for the past six years			1
he has been isolated from other classmates , beaten during school trips and locked up in the classroom			0
" i wanted to tell people about it			0
i did tell my parents , but they did n't take it seriously thinking it was an issue between friends , " he said			0
the bullying became so bad that @entity44 tried to jump from his school building in front of his teachers , but he was stopped by the police			1
he is now involved in creating a music video with other teenagers to raise awareness of school bullying , an issue he says that was not taken seriously until recently			1
the tools of bullying vary from forcing victims to run errands and steal , to sexual assault , confinement and gang beatings			0
with reports of other incidents of teenage violence n schools , including the assault of teachers and rape of younger students , many @entity5 are asking , " what is wrong with our kids ? " the answer , according to some analysts , lies within the hyper - competitive nature of @entity5 society			1
as the country continues to enjoy success economically , @entity5 students are being pushed into an environment of competition to succeed			1
" at school , students do n't see their peers as friends but as competition and believe that they need to beat others , " said dr. @entity84 , a specialist at the @entity85			1
in a classroom environment in which students are forced to prove themselves , those who fall behind in grades turn to other means to show they are more powerful , taking on the role of the aggressor , @entity84 explained			2
the family support system also fails many adolescents			0
" the parents heavily invest in raising their children to be successful and skillful in various fields , but when it comes to raising them to be moral and have healthy personalities i think there has been a lack of interest , " @entity84 said			0
schools and teachers have been criticized for turning the other way in bullying cases and trying to cover it up			2
local governments have gone into a frenzy of drafting up new measures to hold bullies accountable and prevent school violence			0
experts such as @entity84 believe it may take more than simply increasing monitoring of school violence			2
what students need is a healthier environment to learn more social skills and know how to deal with their problems , they say			0
a survey conducted in 2010 by the @entity128 , a counseling center established more than 15 years ago , indicated that more than 20 % of those surveyed said they had been bullied			0
of those victims , more than 30 % said they felt suicidal due to bullying			2
the same group said last year that the number of counseling cases of students seeking help from suicidal feelings doubled from the previous year			2
the concern is that students have not been able to learn how to find solutions to their problems in a rigid educational environment and are now turning to suicide as their last resort			0
counseling groups urge the government and schools to step up and punish those accountable , while keeping the victims safe from harm .			0
