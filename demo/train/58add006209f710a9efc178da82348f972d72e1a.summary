-- " hey , @entity1			2
" @entity2 turned toward her professor in the hall of their community college			1
" what ? " she asked , sure she had misheard			2
" precious -- you know , from the movie , " he repeated			2
the students around them started laughing			2
@entity13 could only stare in disbelief			1
he had just compared her to @entity17 's obese character in the 2009 film			1
" it was like ... someone hit me with a frying pan on my head , " she remembers			2
her mind flashed back to just six months before , when she had gotten a life - changing call			2
her mother -- her best friend in the world -- was dying			1
@entity13 drove all night in hopes of seeing her one last time			1
@entity30 managed to give her youngest daughter just two pieces of advice before succumbing to the cancer that had spread throughout her body			2
lose weight , " @entity13 recites , her mother 's words forever etched into her brain			1
@entity13 had n't listened immediately			1
a herniated disk in her lower back had prevented her from working out ; grief had made her turn to comfort food			0
in the months since her mother 's death she had gained 30 to 40 pounds			1
but that moment with her professor was the last straw			0
" this is it , " she thought , as the crowd around her dissipated			0
" let 's do this			1
" a model 's daughter @entity13 's older sisters were naturally thin			1
they took after their mother , who had been a model			1
she grew up " husky " and steadily gained weight throughout her teenage years			1
she and her mother fought constantly over her size			1
@entity30 would push her daughter to lose weight , but continued to buy junk food for the whole family			1
" bless her heart , she did n't know how to really deal with it , " @entity13 remembers			1
" i 'm eating what everyone else is eating			0
... none of her other children looked like me			0
" in desperation , @entity13 tried everything from crash diets to extreme exercise to battle the bulge			1
at one point , she was eating fewer than 500 calories a day			0
she would lose weight for a short time and then put it right back on when real life won out			1
" they do n't really make large clothing that 's attractive , " she says			2
" everything just looks like a tarp			0
" she longingly watched as her friends tried on cute clothes and went on dates			0
her first kiss was postponed until college			0

slow and steady the humiliating " @entity1 " incident took place in january 2010			0
that night , @entity13 got on her treadmill at home and walked for 10 minutes			1
it was rough , but she promised herself she 'd do it again the next day			0
she was going to take the weight off no matter how long it took			2
every day she walked just a little bit longer , a little bit farther			2
by year 's end , she had lost 30 pounds and worked her way up to a jog			1
she still had n't exercised outside her house , fearing embarrassment			0
she would be graduating soon with a degree in criminal justice , and thought she might make a good police officer			0
she started training for the fitness test , but a stress fracture in her tibia prevented her from attending tryouts at the academy			0
@entity13 thought about what she really wanted to do			1
she realized she was happy with her new health routine			0
could she work in the fitness industry ? she did some research and came across the @entity132 of @entity134 's certified personal training program			1
personal training is a booming job field , says academy spokesman @entity137			2
" everyone is aware there 's an ( obesity ) crisis , an epidemic , " he says			2
" people are trying a variety of different methods to improve their fitness levels , but they 're not achieving success independently			0
they 're recognizing they need a coach , a motivator , who will hold them accountable			0
" personal trainers provide clients with programs to achieve their goals , @entity137 says , whether that 's weight loss , muscle building or overall fitness			1
the @entity132 of sports medicine certification teaches everything from basic anatomy to kinesiology to motivational techniques			0
@entity137 loves to see people who have lost a significant amount of weight become trainers			2
" it 's helpful for somebody in this industry if they can relate to their clients from a personal perspective , " he says			1
" if you have a personal trainer who knows what it 's like to be 20 or 30 pounds overweight ... it helps in gaining ( the client 's ) confidence			1
" @entity13 passed her certification exam on her way to losing another 30 to 40 pounds			1
she designated 2012 as the year of running : she ran her first @entity181 in may and her first half marathon later that year			0
toward the end of the year , she finally joined a gym and began to lift weights			0
" ( i thought ) i look good in my clothes , but do i look good naked ? " she says with a laugh			0
now she hits the gym five to six days a week to weight train and run			2

@entity13 eats six small meals a day that almost always include protein , whether it 's chicken , tuna , @entity197 yogurt or fish			1
she has a gallon of water on her desk at work			0
( " i 'm constantly going to the bathroom , " she says			0
) she 's given up @entity206 fries and @entity206 bread , possibly her two biggest diet downfalls , although she gives herself permission to splurge during one meal a week			2
all her hard work has paid off			0
@entity13 has lost 85 pounds and inspires others on her blog , @entity214			1
moving on about a year ago , @entity13 ran into her old college professor , the one who had called her " precious			1
" she had n't seen him since her graduation			0
like a scene from a movie , @entity13 dropped an orange and it rolled across the floor			1
her professor picked it up as a million sentences ran through her head			0
" i had dreamed of this moment , " she says			0
" i thought i was going to walk into his office and be like , ' look at me now			0
' " instead she simply said , " thank you			0
" " if he had n't said that , none of this would have happened , " she explains			0
" he still has no clue			0
" for now , @entity13 is working as a leasing consultant at an apartment complex			1
but she 's studying to be a fitness nutrition specialist with the @entity132 of @entity134 and hopes to eventually get enough clients to be a personal trainer full time			1
she also has her eye on a few bikini competitions , perhaps as a nod to her mother 's modeling career			1
she imagines @entity30 would flip out if she saw her daughter now , and would immediately want to go shopping			0
" she would love that i listened to her and took her advice , " @entity13 says			1
" she would be really proud of me because i did it the right way			0
" have you lost weight ? share your story on @entity251 .			2
