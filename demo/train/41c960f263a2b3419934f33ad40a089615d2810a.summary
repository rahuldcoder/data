@entity0 , a deadly diarrheal disease , has been rare in the @entity2 since the early 1900s , but in the developing world , where access to clean drinking water is more difficult , it is still a serious problem			1
dr. @entity9 has studied cholera for nearly 50 years , and has written more than 700 publications and received at least 40 honorary degrees			1
the former director of the @entity14 and former president of the @entity16 , @entity9 is currently a distinguished professor at both the @entity17 , @entity17 and @entity19 's @entity18			1
@entity20 spoke with @entity9 about her research and how she and her team helped develop an incredibly simple method to help the people of rural @entity25 have cleaner , safer drinking water			1
the following is an edited portion of that interview			0
a medical miracle : saving cholera victims @entity20 : tell me about cholera			2
@entity9 : cholera is ... transmitted by water			1
the bacteria that causes the disease ... ( naturally occurs ) in the aquatic environment			2
that 's a discovery that my laboratory made some 25 to 30 years ago			0
when ingested , it attaches to the intestine and a toxin is most frequently produced			0
the result is severe vomiting , diarrhea and if a person does n't have their fluid replenished , dehydration and eventually death ( results )			0
@entity20 : is there an antibiotic for cholera ? @entity9 : you can take an antibiotic			1
it 's generally susceptible to tetracycline , a broad - spectrum antibiotic , and other antibiotics			2
there 's been a discovery some years ago of what 's called oral rehydration therapy , @entity65 , whereby a mixture in water of table salt , bicarbonate of soda and table sugar is mixed in appropriate concentration and sipped			2
this replenishes the fluid loss and is very effective in treating cholera			2
@entity20 : that 's interesting that it does n't seem people die from the bacteria attacking their systems , but rather the dehydration effects			0
@entity9 : that 's predominantly the case			1
the toxin can have other effects but mainly it 's the sodium - potassium transport mechanism that gets interfered with			2
@entity25 has two major epidemics every year : spring , which is right about now , and fall : september , october , november			1
this occurs year after year with almost no exception due to the fact that , as we have shown , the bacteria are associated with plankton			2
as the plankton become abundant , they bloom in the spring and fall , after which the cholera bacteria become abundant in the water and the disease occurs			1
@entity20 : are cholera outbreaks connected to global warming ? @entity9 : temperature is a major regulator of the abundance of the cholera bacteria			1
the study that was carried out by @entity107 in @entity108 , with which we collaborated , was an analysis of plankton samples that had been stored for the past 40 years at a marine laboratory in @entity114			0
they 'd been collecting samples every year for 40 years and so we analyzed the samples , and what dr. @entity107 and our team found was that as the water temperature is increasing , the numbers of vibrios ( small , comma - shaped bacteria ) and the number of cases of diseases caused by vibrio , namely cholera , have been increasing			1
it has been directly related to the warming of the sea temperature			1
@entity20 : can you describe the method you developed in @entity25 to control cholera ? @entity9 : having done an enormous amount of research showing the ecology of the cholera bacterium , ( we found ) it was definitely tied to plankton			1
the cholera bacteria is part of their natural flora			0
it occurred to us that by simple filtration to remove the plankton , we would filter about 99 % of the bacteria , leaving just a few suspended in the water			0
so then , we hypothesized , we could reduce cholera significantly by educating women who collect water for their household to use cloth filtration			1
probing the mysteries of probiotics we found that sari cloth that comprised the dresses that women wear , if folded about four times , gave a very nice mesh filter , with small enough pore size to trap plankton			0
a three - year study was funded by the @entity165 and @entity166 that involved about 50 villages and over 150,000 people , and sure enough , by having women filter their water collected from the ponds and rivers every day , we showed about a 50 % decrease in cholera			1
a very simple step , and very important			0
@entity20 : how did you get the message out to everyone that they should be doing this ? @entity9 : we worked with the women in the villages and we trained them , essentially as extension agents ... to go to the villages every week with a meeting for the women of the village to explain to them why it 's good to filter , how to filter , and the difference it would make to the health of their children			2
so with this constant reinforcement , we found that indeed , they did filter because they found that their children did n't get sick			0
and that , of course , was a big incentive			0
the project ended about six years ago , but we went back to see if they were still filtering , and we found 75 % of them were			0
@entity20 : so , do you think that clean water is the key to controlling waterborne diseases like cholera ? or , do you think it 's getting people the education about better sanitation ? @entity9 : it 's a combination of sanitation and safe water			1
... we do not have cholera in the @entity2			0
we have not had it since about 1930 when filtered , chlorinated household water was made available			0
similarly in @entity221 , back in the 1890s and 1900s , cholera epidemics were devastating			0
in fact , cholera played into outcomes of major wars when troops became debilitated by the cholera bacterium			0
so , a combination of proper sanitation and filtered , chlorinated , safely distributed water -- not just cholera , but at least two dozen diseases transmitted by contaminated water can be prevented			2
@entity20 : what could we do as a nation to help this effort to getting education about sanitation and clean drinking water to more developing countries ? @entity9 : i think education for both proper sanitation and for filtering water is very badly needed			1
i also work with @entity245 , which is a philanthropic organization that delivers kiosks ... that provide filtered water on a larger scale			0
we need to think of water availability depending on the environment and the conditions on which the water can be made available			1
it 's not all one - size - fits - all			1
for example , filtration in a major city probably is n't as effective as chlorinating the water and having it distributed safely , which many cities in developing countries do			0
... but for the remote villages , they do n't have that kind of access , so their simple filtration is really , really helpful			0

@entity9 has been studying cholera for half a century
her team discovered an *innovative* way to control the disease in @entity25
research has shown cholera is related to global warming , she says
clean water availability is not " one - size - fits - all "
