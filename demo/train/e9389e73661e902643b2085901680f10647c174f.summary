-- the crisis in @entity2 , though potentially destabilizing to the global economy , may present a silver lining to the @entity6 economy : an opportunity to reinvigorate the @entity6 shipbuilding industry and @entity9			1
even though @entity12 supplies 30 % of @entity14 's natural gas , president @entity11 's territorial aggression is causing @entity14 to look elsewhere for its energy needs			1
the @entity6 should be prudent in exporting this natural resource , which has led to resurgence in domestic manufacturing , but i believe that the liquefied natural gas we do send overseas should be shipped on @entity6 - flagged tankers and crewed by @entity6 licensed and unlicensed mariners			1
i am pursuing this policy , as the ranking member of the @entity25 and @entity26 and a member of the @entity28 , because it will boost the domestic maritime industry and strengthen our national defense and economic security			0
@entity6 natural gas , globally , is abundant and cheap , making it an attractive commodity for other nations that are net importers of energy resources			1
the @entity37 has approved seven liquefied natural gas export applications , and 24 more are pending			1
to transport gas via the ocean , the world must rely upon two countries to build these tanker vessels : @entity44 and @entity45			1
despite being the early pioneer in gas tanker technology , @entity6 is no longer on this list			2
for decades , the federal government and @entity50 have largely ignored the health of its own shipbuilding industry , especially the capacity to build large oceangoing tankers , bulk carriers and container vessels			2
in 1951 , we had 1,200 ships in the @entity6 foreign trade			0
today , we have 90 ships			0
obviously , this is not a good trajectory if we are to maintain our heritage as a great maritime nation			0
everyone agrees that the @entity6 is the greatest naval power in the world			0
but our naval superiority may not sustain itself if we fail to make the necessary investments to maintain and enhance our technological edge			0
we can do that by reinvigorating an innovative shipbuilding industrial base , and by requiring that liquefied natural gas exports be carried on @entity6 bottoms , we can provide a new long - term market to sustain this revitalization			1
those who oppose such a policy often point to two criticisms			0
first , recognizing at present that there are no @entity6 shipyards building liquefied natural gas tankers , how can we require such exports to be carried on @entity6 ships that are not being built ? they are not being built because in some markets , especially strategic ones like shipbuilding and defense , the government must require that we maintain these capabilities through policies such as the one i am proposing			1
our shipyards assure me that if we were to adopt such a policy , they could retool their production lines and have liquefied natural gas tankers sliding down the ways within five years , not long after the first export terminal is completed			1
the other criticism is that it will cost more to use @entity6 - built liquefied natural gas tankers than those built in foreign yards and that this cost differential will be an impediment to the growth of the export market			1
this argument is about the bottom line of energy companies and not the bottom line of @entity6 's shipbuilding industry			2
our nation 's economic and national security and the well - being of our middle class would benefit from this new source of high - paying jobs , both in the shipyards and in our @entity9			0
opportunities must be seized when they become apparent			0
we have allowed other nations to wrest away from the @entity6 its former dominance in this strategically vital industry			0
we must seize the exportation of natural gas as an opportunity to reinvigorate the domestic maritime industry and bolster our national defense			2
we are a maritime nation , and we can build liquefied natural gas tankers in @entity6			1
but in order to do so , we must act now			0
join us on @entity132 / @entity131			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of rep. @entity135 .			2

rep. @entity135 argues that @entity14 may look beyond @entity12 for natural gas
that , he says , creates an opening for *increased* exports of @entity6 liquefied natural gas
it also increases the need for @entity6 - flagged transport ships , he writes
but the @entity6 shipbuilding industry has withered as @entity44 and @entity45 have *thrived*
