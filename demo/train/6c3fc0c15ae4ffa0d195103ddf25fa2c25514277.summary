-- the massacre of students and a teacher within the seemingly safe hallways of @entity5 reverberated so strongly that its reflection can be found in the creations of multiple artists , writers , musicians , and filmmakers over the past decade			1
" @entity13 , " musician @entity12 , and the bestseller " @entity14 " entered the spotlight post-columbine			1
" it was n't the first school shooting , but it became the extreme case , " said @entity17 , founding director of the @entity18 for @entity19 and @entity20 at @entity21			1
" @entity25 ' became a word that represented something much , much larger than that particular high school			2
" @entity25 , in some ways , represents the broad insecurity triggered by extreme acts of violence			2
@entity33 , @entity34 , is as picturesque as the set of a family film			1
and thanks in part to the 24 - hour news cycle , the world witnessed scenes that appeared to be out of a movie : bloodied victims escaping through windows and frightened teens scurrying to safety as law enforcement descended			2
film critic @entity48 said films such as @entity51 's " elephant " do not have to reach far into the @entity53 psyche to tell a tale of horror in a post-columbine world			1
" @entity25 is now a little like the way 9/11 is engrained in our cultural perspective , so that something like ' @entity13 ' does n't even have to directly allude to it , " he said			2
" because we were so immersed in @entity25 ... the filmmakers know that the audience has that reference point , so it does n't take much to even poke at that for all of that dimension to come swimming through our consciousness			1
" " @entity13 , " which won two awards at the @entity75 in 2003 , dramatized a normal day at a high school that is about to become the scene of a planned mass slaughter by a pair of friends			2
television shows such as " @entity77 " and " @entity78 " also delved into the lives of fictitious teens on murderous rampages			2
but music is the one medium that seemed almost primed for an interpretation of the day 's events			1
shock rocker @entity12 weathered speculation that his songs may have influenced the pair of young murderers			1
he addressed the issue in a @entity94 magazine article in 1999			2
" when it comes down to who 's to blame for the high school murders in @entity33 , @entity34 , throw a rock and you 'll hit someone who 's guilty , " @entity95 wrote			2
" we 're the people who sit back and tolerate children owning guns , and we 're the ones who tune in and watch the up - to - the - minute details of what they do with them			0
" the spotlight on @entity95 did n't discourage other artists from referencing @entity25 in their songs , music videos and lyrics			1
genres from rock to rap reflected on the tragedy			1
@entity95 himself released an album titled " @entity123 ( in the @entity124 ) " that contained songs alluding to the massacre			1
in the single " @entity129 , " @entity95 appeared to reiterate statements from his first - person piece in @entity94 with the lyrics " some children died the other day , we fed machines and then we prayed , puked up and down in morbid faith , you should have seen the ratings that day			0
" music , tv and film were not the only media that reacted to the shootings			1
in 2005 , an independent video game developer released " @entity142 , " a role - playing game that allowed users to imagine themselves as the @entity25 gunmen and act out the violence			1
@entity147 , publisher of @entity148 , said the game is not indicative of the game market as a whole			1
he pointed out that that 85 percent of video games are rated " e for everyone " " @entity155 plus " or " @entity156			0
" fewer violent video games are being produced today , @entity147 said , despite the perception that the industry mostly produces " spray and slay " entertainment			0
" the industry is becoming a lot more sensitive in realizing that we have a medium that reaches more people than ever , " @entity147 said			0
ireport.com : how did @entity25 affect you ? @entity33 , @entity34 , was also very much on the mind of bestselling author @entity171 when she came up with the idea for her popular 2007 novel " nineteen minutes			0
" " i have three children and i was watching all of them , at different points in their school careers , being bullied , " she said			0
" it got me wondering why , in a post- @entity25 world , we have n't figured this out yet			0
" @entity171 's novel told the story of a bullied , alienated high school student who commits an act of violence			0
records have since been released disputing that @entity187 and @entity188 were outcasts or the targets of bullying			0
@entity171 said it was powerful for her to speak with @entity25 survivors			0
she received a standing ovation from families in @entity33 during a book event held there			0
" it was really moving , " she said			0
" you realize that the people who want to talk about it the most are the people who lived through it			0
the one thing i think we have learned , and the one thing i thing pop culture is good for , is the more that we see it pop up , the more we are reminded that this is a worthy subject			0
