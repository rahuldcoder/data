@entity0 -- members of a key @entity5 - controlled @entity4 panel cast the first congressional votes on a sweeping bipartisan immigration reform bill on thursday , turning back the first @entity8 attempts to beef up the legislation 's border security provisions			1
the @entity11 met for eight hours , debating and holding votes on more than 30 proposed amendments			1
a majority of the amendments were adopted , but no key provisions in the 844 - page bill were significantly altered			2
" when it comes to border security , for whatever reason , @entity5 are going to be inclined to say it is secure and @entity25 are going to be inclined to say it 's not , " said sen. @entity18 , @entity20 - @entity19			0
" i 'm not blaming anybody , but that 's the way this thing 's going to break out in terms of votes			0
" @entity18 and @entity33 @entity8 sen. @entity32 -- part of the " @entity37 " senators responsible for crafting the bill -- sided with the committee 's @entity5 on the key votes			2
the four @entity5 and four @entity25 in the " @entity37 " have promised to oppose any major changes to the bill			1
" the gang stuck together , as we were told they would , on anything that 's significantly impacting their legislation that they drafted with their friends , " said sen. @entity42 , @entity43 , a leading critic of the bill			0
and everybody needs to know it -- who 's calling the shots			0
" another member of the " @entity37 " on the committee , @entity59 democrat @entity58 , urged his colleagues to " be constructive			2
" " do n't make an effort to kill a bill that is the best hope for immigration reform , " @entity58 said			2
this is the " best hope to ( overcome ) the partisan gridlock that has strangled the @entity4 , the @entity66 and the country			0
" among the amendments rejected by the committee : a proposal from sen. @entity71 , @entity72 , to block the legalization of any undocumented resident until " effective " control of the entire @entity78 - @entity77 border has been established for six months			1
a majority on the committee also rejected a proposal by @entity8 sen. @entity82 to triple the number of @entity85 agents along the @entity77 border , while quadrupling the level of equipment and other assets along the border , including cameras , sensors , drones , and helicopters			0
@entity82 's amendment , similar to @entity71 's , would have blocked any legalization of undocumented residents until " operational control " of the entire @entity77 border has been established			2
@entity32 and other opponents of @entity82 's amendment argued it would cost tens of billions of dollars -- a fiscally irresponsible move when @entity66 is trying to cut deficit spending			0
the bill as currently written commits additional resources to southern border security and establishes a new system of metrics to measure border control effectiveness , but critics insist the plan is full of holes and will ultimately do little to help stem to the tide of illegal immigration			1
while claiming to strengthen the border , the legislation would also create a 13 - year path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants while bringing dramatic change to labor policy on @entity78 's farms			1
if enacted , the plan would constitute the first overhaul of the nation 's immigration policy since 1986			1
proponents say the change is necessary to permanently and fairly resolve the status of roughly 11 million undocumented residents			0
critics insist the proposed change amounts to amnesty , rewarding those who chose to break the country 's immigration laws			0
the @entity11 is set to continue its consideration of the " @entity37 " bill next tuesday .			1

new : @entity11 considers amendments to " @entity37 " bill for eight hours
new : panel rejects major changes to border control provisions in the bill
new : panel set to resume consideration of the bill next tuesday
if enacted , the plan would be the first overhaul of @entity78 immigration policy since 1986
