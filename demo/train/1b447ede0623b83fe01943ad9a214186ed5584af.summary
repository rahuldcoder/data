-- celebrities are no strangers to charity work : @entity3 created his one campaign to fight global poverty , @entity7 travels the world as a @entity10 good will ambassador , and the recently named " @entity11 " @entity12 reportedly donated thousands of dollars worth of winter clothing to homeless people in @entity15 , where he 's filming his latest movie			1
is this all part of keeping up appearances in image - centric @entity19 , or do most celebrities have a genuine desire to use their star status to help raise money or awareness for certain causes ? @entity27 , who founded @entity28 -- which helps connect celebrities and charities -- says he thinks there 's a true desire by celebrities to get involved			1
" maybe sometimes people might think it 's a good idea ( for a celebrity 's image ) ... but most of the time it 's a genuine interest , " @entity27 said			1
" in fact , there ( are ) a lot of celebrities who do charity work who do n't even want cameras around			2
" @entity27 spoke to @entity0 about why he started the organization and whether " young @entity19 " has embraced charity and grass roots causes : @entity0 : what inspired you to create give back @entity19 and what exactly does this organization do ? @entity27 : i really just fell into it			1
i 'm a lawyer and ... in 2003 i met a lot of celebrities and reality stars in social circles who were wanting to give back but did n't know how ... i met @entity63 from " @entity64 " ) at an event , and i asked him , ' what charities or causes do you support ? ' ( and ) he said he did n't have one charity he works closely with			1
because he 's a dancer , i thought he 'd connect with the @entity70 ( which helps children with cancer through dance therapy )			1
long story short , he went to @entity76 ( in @entity77 ) and participated in a dance therapy session			1
@entity0 : do you think most celebrities get involved with charity as part of marketing their overall image ? or is there more of a genuine desire to use their star status to raise awareness for those in need ? @entity27 : i can honestly say doing this for seven years , 99 % of the time it 's a genuine interest			1
maybe sometimes people might thing it 's a good idea ( for their image ) ... but most of the time it 's a genuine interest ... in fact , there 's a lot of celebrities who do charity work who do n't even want cameras around			2
... some examples : @entity106 from " @entity107 " plays basketball at the @entity109 or @entity110 from " @entity111 " and " @entity115 " is a cheerleading squad coach in @entity113 ... she probably never told anyone until i asked			0
and that 's what i love , that shows a true commitment , and genuine interest , not wanting to promote it			0
but then again , i have just as much respect for those who want to promote it because they set an example for other celebrities			0
and that 's where their greatest strength lies : in using their celebrity status			0
and that 's the main premise of @entity134 : we love working with grass roots nonprofits			0
i think it 's great , ( top celebrities like ) @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity7 , do amazing work ... but i think it 's important to highlight other great things by young @entity19 , @entity144 from " @entity145 " ... @entity150 from " @entity151 , " @entity147 from the " @entity149 " cast ... people might not realize it 's not just the a-listers who are philanthropic , it 's everyone from young @entity19			1
@entity0 : what 's one instance of a small or large deed by a celebrity that has struck you as particularly inspiring ? @entity27 : i would say i think @entity140 , i have to say ... i took a quick look at this @entity162 article that claimed ... his charity quotient was n't as high as his net worth , but i think that 's ridiculous because from a pr and personal perspective , he 's very philanthropic : i was at @entity76 where he personally visited patients and surprised them with a screening of " @entity173 " ... and personally visited the bedside of a patient who was dying and a big @entity140 fan , even though he was late for his next appointment			2
he made it a point to visit her and spend time with her			0
so i know @entity140 does it from the heart			0
i think he 's setting an example for future generations			0
@entity0 : is there a particular celebrity -- maybe someone with a bad - boy image -- whose generosity has surprised you ? @entity27 : i would say the best example of that might be @entity194 , who has gotten a lot of flak ( he was recently arrested for gun and drug charges ) ... he just came to my @entity200 event ... he loves kids and he 's all about giving back			2
@entity0 : what 's one area where you think @entity19 could do better in teaming up with charitable organizations ? @entity27 : -- i 'd like to see more ... of the people behind the scenes get more involved : producers , directors , the talent agencies and the people who support the celebrities ... they have a say in whether a celebrity participates in certain things			1
sometimes the celebrity does n't even hear about ( events or charities ) ... i 'd like to see @entity19 work more as a team , and all come together to support charity			2
right now it 's sort of splintered			0
it should just be automatic ... and it 's something that the whole team from the publicists to the agents ... that should all be their focus			0
it 's a win - win and there ' s nothing better than seeing a smile on a kid 's face ... when you surprise them with their favorite celebrity .			0

@entity27 founded " @entity134 " to help link celebrities and causes
he helped connect a " @entity64 " star with a dance therapy charity
he talks about whether younger stars are as charitable as a-listers
@entity27 hopes to see everyone in @entity19 embrace the idea of giving
