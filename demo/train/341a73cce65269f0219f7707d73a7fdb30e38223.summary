@entity0 had reached his breaking point			0
with a metal pin in his arm and @entity4 coursing through his veins , he picked up the phone to call his psychiatrist			0
@entity0 had undergone surgery for a broken arm after his then - boyfriend allegedly threw him down the stairs when he tried to leave their home			1
now he sat on the phone with his doctor , explaining why he could n't carry on , as he tried to overdose on painkillers			0
the attempt to end his life , which landed him in a psychiatric ward for two days , resulted in part because he felt trapped in the abusive relationship and saw no way out			0
" i could n't let my boyfriend go because he was n't allowing me to , " @entity0 said			0
@entity0 is one of an estimated 3.4 % of adults who self - identify as lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender , referred to as @entity28 , in the @entity29			1
he 's also one of a quarter of gay men in @entity29 who report having encountered intimate partner violence			1
while @entity0 reached out to @entity28 resources for help while he was ensnared in the abusive relationship , including the @entity35 's 24 - hour crisis hot line in @entity36 , many in his position find that help is hard to come by			1
now , thanks to new @entity28 - inclusive language in the @entity43 , signed into law this month , domestic violence victims like @entity0 will have access to many of the same abuse and trauma services as victims of heterosexual partner violence			1
@entity51 , the senior legislative counsel at the @entity52 , said the new language explicitly includes the lgbt community in the largest @entity56 grant program , the stop grant program			1
previously , there was no grant money specifically allocated to providing domestic violence services and outreach for the @entity28 population			1
" this provides funding to care providers who collaborate with prosecution and law enforcement officials to address domestic violence , " @entity51 said			1
originally passed in 1994 , the @entity56 provides support for organizations that serve domestic violence victims			1
president @entity73 signed the reauthorization into law in @entity76 on march 7 , saying it was a " day of the advocates , a day of the survivors			2
" the act 's new language highlights the reality that @entity28 people also experience intimate partner and sexual violence			1
after the announcement , the president of the @entity87 , @entity88 , said in statement : " this legislation that extends protections to all victims no matter their race , legal status or sexual orientation sends an important message that no victim should be excluded from receiving critical resources that will help them live a life free of abuse			2
" human rights and domestic violence activists say @entity28 people are an underserved population when it comes to victim services and outreach			1
according to a study by the @entity110 , 45 % of @entity28 victims were turned away when they sought assistance from a domestic violence shelter			1
nearly 55 % of those who filed for protection orders were denied them			0
lack of access to services is not exclusive to the lgbt community ; heterosexual victims are also turned away from shelters , usually for lack of space or funding as opposed to intolerance			2
according to the @entity129 , the state turned away 19,000 victims in 2011 from shelters because of inadequate space			0
still , not all states have laws ensuring the availability of civil orders of protection to @entity28 victims , which may further contribute to victims ' isolation			1
" when we do n't include @entity28 in the conversation , when we have conversations that assume this is violence that only happens to women as perpetrated by men , we are n't giving @entity28 the language to talk about their own relationships , " said @entity140 , the executive director of the @entity141			1
" by omission , we 're saying ' you do n't matter -- you 're not a part of this			0
' " the @entity56 language comes at a pivotal time , as incidences of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender violence have come under more scrutiny			2
a 2010 @entity163 survey found that the prevalence of intimate partner violence was higher in some @entity28 relationships than in their heterosexual counterparts : 61 % of bisexual women and 44 % of lesbian women reported intimate partner violence versus 35 % of heterosexual women			1
meanwhile , 26 % of gay men and 37 % of bisexual men reported being assaulted or stalked by a partner , compared with 29 % of heterosexual men			0
the special report of the @entity177 and @entity178 was the first of its kind to present comparisons between groups by sexual orientation			2
according to @entity140 , the @entity56 reauthorization breaks down the barriers that @entity28 people face when they recognize their relationship is unhealthy and violent -- and decide to reach out for support			1
" some of those barriers are very unintentional			0
they are service providers who are used to dealing with violence against women and have these very gendered ways of talking about the problem , " @entity140 said			2
for instance , if a woman calls a domestic violence hot line , most hot lines will immediately divert to language specific to boyfriends or husbands			1
@entity140 said there 's no intent to discriminate or be insensitive , it 's just an easy assumption because the majority of callers are females with male abusive partners			2
( according to the @entity87 , 97 % of its callers are female			0
) at the same time , the assumption can be alienating			0
" the first question makes them think , ' oh , can i say that i 'm a lesbian ? ' or if a man calls , he is treated suspiciously because the presumption is that he 's an abusive partner calling around looking for his wife or girlfriend , " @entity140 said			2
" the first response that men may have is ' oh no , this might not be a friendly place for me to go			0
' " because of the new @entity28 provisions , the law has been decried by anti-same - sex - marriage groups , including the @entity226			1
" all persons must be protected from violence , but codifying the classifications ' sexual orientation ' and ' gender identity ' as contained in @entity233 is problematic , " the bishops said			2
" these two classifications are unnecessary to establish the just protections due to all persons			0
they undermine the meaning and importance of sexual difference			0
they are unjustly exploited for purposes of marriage redefinition , and marriage is the only institution that unites a man and a woman with each other and with any children born from their union			2
" the @entity52 sees the reauthorization as a landmark achievement			0
" one of the most amazing consequences is that not only did the @entity256 - led @entity255 , but the @entity257 led by @entity258 passed language that prevents discrimination , " @entity51 said			2
the @entity257 passed the @entity255 's version of @entity56 after the @entity257 @entity258 's version of the bill , which did not include protection for @entity28 people , was defeated			1
for domestic violence survivors like @entity267 , it 's a welcome starting point in acknowledging and understanding the particular challenges of @entity28 intimate partner violence			1
" the gay community , my friends , supported me because @entity28 domestic violence is very common -- at least in @entity36 , " @entity0 said			1
" the people that saw what i was going through were there when i needed them , but it took me going through the abuse first			0
" when a friend wo n't walk away from abuse @entity0 ultimately filed a restraining order when his ex-boyfriend began stalking him at his mother 's house while he recovered from his suicide attempt and other injuries			0
while domestic violence in heterosexual relationships certainly is n't limited to physical abuse , @entity140 said emotional abuse is a particularly powerful tactic in @entity28 relationships			1
" for example , threatening to out your partner to their boss when you live in a state with no employment nondiscrimination protection for being gay , that 's a really powerful threat , no matter what size you are in proportion to your partner , " @entity140 said			0
@entity140 finds the isolation and rejection many @entity28 people feel from their families and friends who may not have accepted their lifestyle can also play a major role in how they view their relationships with their partners			1
as a way to control their partner , abusers might say things like : if you leave me , who else is going to love you ? who else is going to be there for you ? " it can really put someone who is already feeling insecure about their connections to people in a space where they feel really dependent on their abusive partner , " said @entity140			0
@entity0 , who turns 50 this month , said his experiences led him to become a public advocate against abuse and sexual violence to show that it does , indeed , get better			0
he has written a book about being a survivor titled " @entity338			0
" " i do n't want to see another person live the way i did , " @entity0 said			0
" i went to hell and back and what i tell people now is , i 'll never live with that kind of abuse again			0

*members* of the @entity28 community suffer domestic violence at higher rates than straights
many of those hurt *struggle* to find support resources to leave *bad* relationships
@entity358 includes @entity28 @entity29
anti-same - sex - marriage groups see the move as a blow , while advocates think it 's a boon
