editor 's note : @entity2 is the host and managing editor of @entity4 , a @entity6 @entity5 - language radio talk show and a media entrepreneur			1
@entity2 says it was a mistake for @entity10 voters to support @entity12 's gay marriage ban			1
@entity6 ( @entity13 ) -- it 's a done deal : proposition 8 , making same - sex marriage illegal in @entity17 , has been approved by voters			1
the constitution of the state was amended to take away rights recognized by the @entity17 @entity22 under the equal protection clause of the @entity17 constitution just this may			2
and @entity25 were in the vanguard , providing critical support for the passage of @entity12			1
for the past few weeks , @entity25 have called in to my radio show , horrified at the idea of same - sex marriage			1
callers said they would vote for @entity34 for change -- and for @entity12			2
they told me that the future of their family was at stake			0
biblical passages were quoted , divinely inspired indignation given voice			0
the vision of a collapsed society , where men abandon their wives in droves to " become gay , " ' consumed these callers			0
is this simply a case of cognitive dissonance ? by now , the media has reported the importance of the @entity10 vote to @entity34 's win in such key states as @entity57 , @entity58 , and @entity59			0
president - elect @entity34 , by some early estimates , garnered the largest share of the @entity10 vote of any candidate in history , carrying it by more than 2 to 1 over @entity65			0
in spite of what seems to be sweeping approval for a progressive agenda , @entity10 support of @entity12			1
8 has exposed an entrenched bias against homosexuality at once profound and confounding			0
perhaps because of the teachings of the @entity77 priests and now the evangelical preachers who have captured many @entity25 ' devotional intensity ; or simply because of the macho albatross we all carry as part of our @entity10 heritage , the very idea of gay marriage is anathema to many in the @entity10 community			0
the fight for civil rights in @entity88 -- from the abolition of slavery in 1865 , through the battle for a woman 's right to vote , to the @entity94 -- has been long , fierce , and steady			1
politicians from both parties never tire of telling us that a metaphorical @entity98 rings brightly , as it does in no other country in the world			0
yet even as civil rights in @entity88 have come so far , @entity25 still suffer keenly under the heel of oppression			1
everyday , i feel the blow of news reports about @entity25 struggling against dark odds in our country : the immigrant mother forgotten in a jail cell for four days without food , water , or a toilet ; slaughterhouse workers herded like the cattle they process into an @entity118 bus			0
@entity119 , @entity120 , sheriff @entity121 , who has attacked the immigration conundrum with zeal , is being sued by @entity10 human rights organizations for allegedly demanding proof of citizenship from anyone who looks @entity10 , and even from people listening to spanish - language radio in their cars			2
the irony of @entity10 support for @entity12			1
that a community that continues to struggle for basic rights would deny them to another is particularly baffling			2
a marginalized minority -- latinos -- voting to take away the rights of another marginalized group -- gays and lesbians -- is like the kid who 's picked on in the third grade and only makes some headway when a punier kid comes along to take the punches instead			1
throughout this campaign , in an avalanche of spanish - language commercials , @entity25 were exhorted to vote " yes " on @entity12			1
a calm voice -- a voice that could be selling baby wipes or low - fat cookies -- told us that we should check yes " for the good of our families , " that we must save everything that is good and decent about @entity88			0
take away the civil rights of gays and lesbians so that we can be safe			1
but safe from what ? the low - fat cookie voice of the radio commercial did not really say			0
latinos were asked not just to look away as these rights would be withdrawn , but to actively vote for the demolition of someone else 's family			0
we were implored to look at " them " as the unredeemable " aliens " that must be expurgated from our society			0
once you start the process of taking away other peoples ' fundamental rights -- like food and water in a jail cell , or the right to drive and listen to whatever music you like -- you must ask yourself where to draw the line , and who will draw it ? what -- and whose -- rights will be next on the chopping block ? as @entity194 said , " injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere			2
" you 'd think that as @entity25 , proud and strong and willing to fight for our own rights , - we 'd refuse to turn against the " punier kid , " would n't you ? that we might in fact stand up for that kid , tell the bullies to back off , the same way we told the bullies of racism and " the real @entity88 " to take a hike -- and in the process carried @entity34 to triumph			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : latino voters provided critical support for @entity12 . 8
he says the ban on same - sex marriage *violates* basic civil rights
@entity2 : by taking away rights , a minority group *threatens* its own *liberties*
