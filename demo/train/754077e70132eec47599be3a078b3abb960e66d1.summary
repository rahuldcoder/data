-- @entity2 president @entity1 has unveiled a raft of reforms aimed at restoring credibility to world football 's ruling body , which has been hit by a succession of scandals over the past decade of his tenure			1
accusations of corruption came to a head in the lead - up to last december 's vote to award hosting rights for the 2018 and 2022 @entity18 , with two high - echelon officials banned for life			0
the fallout continued last week as @entity23 members were suspended and fined for their involvement in the cash - for - votes scandal which saw @entity1 's only election rival banned for life before the june 1 ballot			1
while former @entity33 president @entity32 is taking legal action against that punishment , his former fellow @entity30 members have agreed to establish three new task forces and a " good governance committee " in order to clean up the sport 's administration			1
@entity1 revealed at a press conference in @entity42 on friday that he hopes they will be implemented by 2013			0
" we 've been ambitious in our roadmap , " the 75 - year - old said			0
" by 2013 we should have lived up to the requests made by the national associations in 2011			0
that is the goal we have set for ourselves			0
" @entity51 's @entity50 president @entity49 will chair the task force dedicated to revising @entity2 's statutes , while @entity54 will oversee any reforms of the @entity56 of which he is chairman			1
the group focused on transparency and compliance will be headed by @entity61 @entity50 president @entity60 and @entity63 counterpart @entity62 , and @entity51 football legend @entity64 will continue to lead the @entity66 task force which began its work in may			1
the good governance committee will be established at the @entity70 's next meeting on december 16 - 17 , and will have representatives from throughout the football world -- such as players , referees , fans , clubs , national associations -- and from outside , including politicians lawyers , marketing partners			1
former @entity81 secretary of state @entity80 has been involved in an advisory role , but will not be on the committee as @entity1 said he wanted to have currently active politicians instead			2
" we needed to strengthen the @entity56 , so we have a task force which will focus on its independence and how to strengthen it , " @entity1 said			2
" what is most important right now , we also need to provide it with guidelines that do n't come from football and not from the @entity30 and members of different confederations or the @entity56 , but from the national associations			0
they wanted to see something being done			0
" the transparency and compliance task force will be made up of presidents of national associations , and they will identify the problems with which the national associations are faced with respect to @entity2			2
" @entity1 said the @entity70 members , several of whom have faced accusations of corruption in the past decade , were unanimous in agreeing on the proposed roadmap			2
" there is only one question mark -- will we be able to live up to the details of it ? i feel very happy that the @entity30 is completely in step with what we want to achieve with the national associations , " he said			0
" we are moving forward with a @entity2 that , especially due to the @entity117 , will allow us in 2013 or even before to present an image other than the one we have currently			0
" @entity1 , who said there would be a push to include at least one woman on the all - male @entity122 for the first time , revealed that court documents from the 10 - year - old case involving @entity2 's former marketing partner @entity127 would be released			1
@entity2 officials @entity129 , @entity130 and former president @entity131 were accused of receiving payments from @entity127 , which folded in 2001			1
the @entity70 will examine the case in december and make the files available to an independent body for scrutiny			0
" the court has said there are people involved , but no @entity140 people -- only foreign people , " @entity1 said			2
he denied claims that @entity2 was a corrupt organization , but claimed that any large body will always have corrupt elements			1
" some people are corrupt , some people are even more than that , but can you say that all are ? at the end of the day in @entity2 , which has 300 million participants , you will always find some violence , doping , corruption , you can not avoid it , but that does not mean that the whole organization is like that			1
