-- about a decade ago , @entity1 was a powerful president , torn between complicated ties with the @entity3 and rising @entity5 militants at home			1
after four and a half years of self - imposed exile , the former @entity8 president hopes to reassert his power			2
@entity1 returned to @entity11 on sunday to help his political party gain momentum prior to the may general election			1
the retired general , who wrested power in a bloodless coup in 1999 and lost it nine years later , acknowledges that happens next is uncertain			0
" it is risky , certainly , " he said			2
" but when i formed this party , the point was to go back and fight the elections			0
why i 'm going back is to do something for the country			0
the cause is much greater than self			0
therefore , i 'm prepared to take the risks for the sake of my country			0
" more security he may not find a warm reception			2
last year , @entity1 scuttled his plans to return after being warned against doing so by the military			1
" there were indications that they did n't want me to come , and my own colleagues told me not to come , " he acknowledged			0
" therefore , i changed my mind			0
" this time , he said , he will be protected by his own private security agents as well as by government security			1
@entity8 's upper house of parliament passed a nonbinding resolution in january 2012 demanding @entity1 be arrested and tried for treason for unconstitutional acts during his regime			1
@entity1 's lawyer obtained pre-arrest bail for him on friday , which means he will not be arrested for at least 15 days , but must appear in court			1
but @entity51 said saturday that the @entity8 government should hold @entity1 accountable for human rights abuses once he returns			1
" @entity1 should not be allowed to elude the serious legal proceedings against him on his return to @entity8 , " said @entity54 , @entity8 director at @entity51			1
" only by ensuring that @entity1 faces the well - documented outstanding charges against him can @entity8 put an end to the military 's impunity for abuses			1
" under @entity1 , the country 's military and its intelligence agencies " committed widespread human rights violations , including the enforced disappearances of thousands of political opponents , particularly from @entity66 province , and tortured hundreds of @entity8 terrorism suspects , " @entity51 said			1
mixed reviews his goal , @entity1 said , is to help lift his country from its malaise			1
" my motivation is to go back and correct the situation , bring it back to the level where i left it			0
" he left it and went into self - imposed exile , largely in @entity82 , after the 2008 elections			0
but he never gave up hopes of returning to the political stage			0
in late 2010 , he launched the @entity87 party with a view to running for office in 2013			0
his years leading the country earned mixed reviews			0
under his leadership , @entity8 attained respectable economic growth rates and established a generally favorable investment climate			0
along with that came a growing middle class , a more aggressive media , and a more assertive judiciary			0
" he brought parliamentary reforms ; he brought women into the parliament , " said @entity98 , director of the @entity99 in an interview last year			0
military mindset but , analysts say , @entity1 never lost his military mindset			1
" he in a way , always believed in a unity of command , a very centralized command , which means his command , in fact , " said lt. gen. @entity112 , a political analyst			0
@entity1 's popularity began dropping in 2007 after he suspended @entity116 chief justice @entity115 for " misuse of authority			1
" the move triggered protests and accusations that he was trying to influence the court 's ruling on whether he could run for another five - year term			1
@entity115 was reinstated but the damage was done			0
that october , @entity1 was re-elected president by a parliament that critics said was stacked with his supporters			1
opposition parties filed a challenge			0
the next month , he declared a state of emergency , suspended @entity8 's constitution , replaced the chief judge again and blacked out independent tv outlets			2
under pressure from the @entity137 , @entity1 later lifted the emergency and promised elections in january 2008			1
he allowed @entity140 , the prime minister he had deposed in 1999 , to return from exile			2
he also let in another political foe , former prime minister @entity143 , who led the @entity145			0
@entity143 returned from a self - imposed , eight - year exile to run in the country 's general elections in 2007 , but was assassinated that december while campaigning in the @entity8 city of @entity150 , the seat of the country 's military , by a 15 - year - old suicide bomber			2
@entity1 's government and the @entity156 contend the killing was orchestrated by a group with ties to @entity160 , but polls found that most @entity8 believed @entity1 's government was complicit			1
he has denied the assertions			0
re-entering politics in 2010 , further criticism of @entity1 emerged after the @entity166 ruled that @entity143 's death could have been prevented had @entity1 's government taken adequate measures to protect her			1
@entity1 rejected the findings , saying that @entity143 had police protection and took unnecessary risks			1
other factors hastened the decline in @entity1 's popularity : a shortage of essential food items , power cuts and high inflation			1
in february 2008 , @entity1 's party admitted defeat in parliamentary elections and he was succeeded by @entity182 , @entity143 's widower			1
the leaders of @entity8 's two main opposition parties formed a coalition and vowed to restore deposed judges			2
six months later , the coalition moved to impeach @entity1 , who then resigned as president and went into self - imposed exile , though he said the allegations of misconduct were false			2
in august 2009 , @entity8 's supreme court found that @entity1 had violated the constitution in 2007 when he imposed a national state of emergency			1
government officials said that if he returned , he 'd be arrested			2
in may 2010 @entity1 announced that he planned to re-enter @entity8 politics and launched a new political party in october of that year			1
but a @entity8 court then issued an arrest warrant for him in connection with @entity143 's assassination			2
he has said that the accusations are baseless			0
he has described his support as scattered , and said he needs to rebuild it			0
" this is a do - or - die moment for me and my party			0
i need to muster all the support i can , " he said			0
exiled @entity8 ex-president returns home @entity0 's @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 contributed to this report .			2

@entity1 must appear in court
