-- the acquittal and mistrial in @entity4 ' campaign finance fraud trial completes a fall from grace that transformed the man who might have been president into one of the most vilified and lampooned political figures in the country			1
opinion : @entity4 jury got it exactly right the boyish - looking , smooth - talking lawyer and self - described " son of a millworker " was once known for rallying supporters with a populist mantra describing two @entity18 -- the haves and have - nots			1
now he is best known for fathering a child in an extramarital affair while his wife @entity22 battled incurable cancer and , according to prosecutors , scheming to use wealthy donors ' money to help him cover up his affair and hide his mistress from the public			0
@entity30 : juror had no intention of flirting with @entity4 it was all so different five years ago , when @entity4 could be heard preaching his populist prose to @entity36 voters who eagerly packed into lumber barns , @entity39 halls and restaurants across the state			1
he had every reason to believe he could be president			0
he felt the country would let @entity44 and @entity45 , both senators at the time with presidential ambitions of their own , destroy each other with negative campaigning			0
@entity4 : once a cheater , always a cheater ? and if the country was n't ready to elect a black man or a woman president , he would rise as the more experienced and safe nominee			1
to many voters , @entity4 was a fitting candidate to live in the @entity57 and serve as president			1
instead , @entity4 appeared in front of tv cameras thursday and took responsibility for " my sins " after his federal corruption case ended in an acquittal and mistrial			1
prosecutors had accused @entity4 of using almost $ 1 million in illegal campaign contributions to keep his pregnant mistress under wraps			1
but after more than 50 hours of deliberations , jurors cleared him of one of six counts and deadlocked on the rest			0
why politicians lie @entity4 , who turns 59 on june 10 , argued that while his actions were wrong , they were not illegal			1
emerging from the courthouse with his parents and daughter at his side , he said that while he never believed he committed a crime , " i did an awful , awful lot that was wrong , and there is no one else responsible for my sins			0
" now a widower , he is the sole caregiver to his two youngest children by his late wife -- @entity90 , 13 , and @entity91 , 11			0

their son , @entity94 , died at age 16 in a 1996 road accident			0

@entity4 charges : the rundown @entity4 also provides financial support for his daughter with @entity105 , his mistress from the campaign trail during his unsuccessful bid for the @entity109 presidential nomination in the 2008 election			1
a product of a working class family from @entity113 , @entity4 got a law degree from the @entity115 at @entity116 in 1977			1
he became a successful trial lawyer representing claimants against large corporations and insurance companies			0
he won his first , and only major , political race in 1998 , unseating a @entity123 incumbent to become a @entity125 senator from @entity126			0
as a senator , @entity4 reportedly made it onto a list of potential running mates for @entity131 in the 2000 presidential election			1
he did n't make the ticket that time			0
but before his first term ended , he was running for president and ended up as sen. @entity137 's running mate in 2004			0
@entity137 lost to incumbent president @entity138			0
once running mates , @entity137 and @entity4 quickly severed their friendship after what was a disappointing election for @entity4			1
he quickly set his sights on @entity36 , gearing up for another presidential bid in 2008			0
@entity4 met @entity145 in early 2006 at a bar at the @entity147 in @entity148			1
@entity145 approached @entity4 , not believing it was him			1
later that evening , @entity4 and @entity145 met again , privately			1
overheard on @entity0 : ' being a slimy dirtbag does n't equal being a criminal ' the man who constantly spoke about two @entity18 began living two lives			0
the 40 - something @entity145 told @entity4 that she could help his campaign			1
@entity4 hired her to produce a few videos that would present the politician in a more relaxed manner			1
the videos were called " webisodes " and were posted to @entity4 ' campaign site			1
however , instead of showing @entity4 in a new light , the flirtatious on - camera banter only highlighted just how close @entity4 and @entity145 had become			2
staffers began to suspect that @entity145 had become more than a videographer to @entity4			1
that thought was fueled by @entity4 ' directive that @entity145 be allowed to travel with him whenever either of them insisted			2
@entity170 was @entity4 ' chief of staff during the time @entity145 traveled with the campaign			1
on several occasions , he talked to @entity173 about @entity145 's involvement with the campaign			0
one heated altercation ended with @entity4 firing @entity170 , and by the fall of 2006 , several longtime senior aides left the campaign amid @entity4 ' refusal to end his relationship with @entity145 , as detailed in " @entity182 , " the book about the 2008 election			1
on december 28 , 2006 , @entity4 launched his presidential campaign in @entity186 against the backdrop of a city trying to rebuild and revive itself			1
he vowed to strengthen the middle class , progressively end poverty and tackle the longstanding @entity109 health care platform			2
but just as the campaign got off the ground , it hit turbulence			0
in march 2007 , @entity173 announced she had breast cancer for the second time , and it was incurable			0
still , they decided to continue with the campaign			0
and in the weeks after the devastating discovery , internal campaign polling showed @entity4 surging ahead of rivals @entity204 and @entity45 in @entity36			1
meanwhile , @entity145 had become pregnant			0
and to complicate things , @entity4 was swimming in a pool of bad press -- he had received $ 400 haircuts and had made a six - figure salary working for a hedge fund that was linked to subprime lending and foreclosed homes			2
the wealthy banking heiress and widow who was once a close friend of @entity217 had been a supporter of @entity4 since the 2004 election			2
after already contributing to @entity4 the maximum allowed by law , @entity214 provided additional money			2
according to court documents , between june 2007 and january 2008 , @entity214 allegedly wrote personal checks payable to a friend , hiding that she was giving money to @entity4			2
the checks were made out to the wife of @entity4 aide @entity228 , in her maiden name , and were deposited into accounts controlled by her and @entity228			2
as @entity4 and @entity228 planned , @entity228 allegedly used the money to provide @entity145 with rent , furniture , care , living expenses , medical visits and prenatal care			2
in total , the now 101 - year - old @entity214 gave @entity4 seven checks ranging from $ 10,000 to $ 200,000			2
on october 10 , 2007 , the @entity241 ran its first story saying @entity4 was having an affair			1
the next day while campaigning in @entity244 , @entity113 , @entity4 denied the report , calling it " tabloid trash			2
" with tabloid reporters and photographers chasing @entity145 and publishing photos of her pregnant , a second wealthy donor came forward			0
@entity252 , a wealthy @entity253 lawyer who is now deceased , was the national finance chair of the campaign			2
court documents show that from december 2007 to january 2008 , @entity252 allegedly wrote nine checks ranging from $ 9,000 to $ 58,000			0
the money was used for @entity228 to hide a pregnant @entity145 from the media , as he falsely claimed paternity for her child			0
@entity252 's money was used to charter a private jet for trips to @entity267 , @entity268 ; @entity269 , @entity270 ; @entity271 and @entity272 , @entity273			0
things were n't faring better for @entity4 on the campaign trail			1
he placed second in the @entity36 caucuses , and following disappointing losses in @entity278 and @entity113 , he ended his campaign for president on january 30 , 2008			2
amid rumors in @entity109 circles that he was secretly trying to broker a deal for vice president or attorney general in a @entity204 or @entity45 administration , reporters remained persistent and continued to ask @entity4 if he was having an affair			1
in february 2008 , @entity145 's and @entity4 ' child was born			2
six months later , after repeated denials , @entity4 admitted he had an affair with @entity145 in an august 8 interview with @entity293			1
when asked in the interview if he was the father of @entity145 's child , he responded , " that is absolutely not true			0
" while his name was not on the birth certificate , @entity4 would eventually claim paternity and apologize for denying the baby was his child			2
in february 2009 , the @entity125 @entity300 acknowledged they had opened an investigation on @entity4 regarding campaign finances			1
by this point , his more than 30 - year marriage was falling apart			0
@entity4 and @entity22 separated and lived apart until @entity173 succumbed to breast cancer weeks before @entity306 in 2010 , with @entity4 and their oldest daughter , @entity307 , at her bedside			0
for @entity4 , life got worse			0
after testimony from a cast of former staffers , including @entity145 -- the latter having published a scandalous tell - all book -- a grand jury indicted @entity4 on june 3 , 2011			0
@entity4 refused a plea bargain that would have given him a few months in prison but would have allowed him to keep his law license .			0
