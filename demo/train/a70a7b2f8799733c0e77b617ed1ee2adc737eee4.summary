-- you might assume @entity2 is the @entity3 capital of income inequality -- what with its multibillion - dollar mayor , its highly paid @entity8 execs and its persistent poverty			1
but if you compare every county in the @entity3 , @entity10 has only the third - highest estimated level of income inequality			1
a little place in @entity15 takes the title			1
@entity19 , @entity15 , is home to 7,500 people , some of whom make six and seven figures and 41 % of whom live below the federal poverty line			1
and is one @entity3 capital of income inequality			1
the farming community , with picturesque @entity26 at its center , is a scary window into the future -- a look at where the rest of the country is headed if we do n't change our economic policies to work for everyone , not primarily the rich			1
the parish , tucked into the northeastern corner of the state , is the subject of my latest @entity45 project because @entity0 readers voted earlier this summer for me to cover income inequality in the place where it is most extreme			1
you chose it as the top social justice issue of our time from a list of 20			1
below , you 'll find a list of the 25 most equal and most unequal counties ( including parishes and equivalents ) in the @entity3			1
these numbers come from the @entity62 's @entity61 , which uses a wonky measurement called the @entity64 to measure income inequality			1
a rating of 0 means the place has perfect economic equality			1
a rating of 100 means only one person in that place makes literally all of the money and everyone else is left with $ 0			1
the most equal countries in the world get ratings in the 20s and 30s			1
the @entity3 , which is the most economically divided of all of the developed countries , had a gini index of almost 48 in 2012 , putting it behind the most - equal nations such as @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 , of course			1
but @entity3 , land of the free , home of the middle class , is worse on this measure than @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , according to a @entity92 list			1
some argue income inequality fosters competition and growth			1
there 's evidence , however , it 's doing just the opposite			1
" inequality stifles , restrains and holds back our growth , " the @entity101 - winning economist @entity100 wrote in january			1
" when even the free - market - oriented magazine @entity105 argues -- as it did in a special feature in october -- that the magnitude and nature of the country 's inequality represent a serious threat to @entity3 , we should know that something has gone horribly wrong			1
" meanwhile , extreme economic gaps tear at the fabric of society			1
we 're a better country when prosperity is shared , as it was before the late 1970s			1
the data below is averaged over the five - year period from 2007 to 2011 , which is the latest data available that includes all counties , including the smaller places			1
some counties technically overlap because of margin of error , and the gini index numbers are estimates			1
you can find a similar but older ranking in a 2012 @entity131 report			1
