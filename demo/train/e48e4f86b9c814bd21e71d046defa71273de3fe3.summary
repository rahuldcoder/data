-- the @entity2 administration is proposing to scrap the @entity4 's bulk collection of all @entity6 ' phone call records			1
the administration 's proposal is eminently sensible			0
it eliminates the government collecting five years of every @entity6 ' phone records and instead mandates that @entity6 phone companies themselves keep those records for only the 18 months that they are required to do so by federal regulations			1
and most importantly , it proposes that a court order would be necessary to obtain the phone records of individual @entity6			1
this ensures that there is some kind of judicial review before the government can get hold of any @entity6 's phone records , rather than leaving this up to the judgment of a small group of anonymous officials at the @entity4			1
the new proposal , first reported in the @entity31 , ensures that the @entity4 is no longer storing vast amounts of data about @entity6 ' calling habits while it still allows the government to access the phone records of terrorism suspects after a judge has reviewed the case			1
this proposed fix to the system hardly seems onerous			0
after all , since 1979 , judges have only turned down 0.3 % of the requests they have received for warrants involving cases of suspected espionage or terrorism			0
such a move would , however , assure @entity6 that there was some sort of due process going on whenever their phone records are examined by the government			1
this is closer to the spirit of the @entity56 , which guards against " unreasonable searches , " than does the present system in which the @entity4 sucks up vast amounts of phone record information			0
the @entity2 administration proposal is particularly welcome in light of a @entity64 study published in january			2
the study looked at the government 's claims about the role that @entity4 " bulk " surveillance of phone records had in keeping the @entity6 safe from terrorism and found that these claims were overblown			1
an in - depth analysis was conducted of 225 individuals recruited by @entity76 or a like - minded group , or inspired by @entity76 ideology and charged in the @entity6 with an act of terrorism since 9/11			0
the analysis demonstrated that traditional investigative methods -- such as the use of informants , tips from local communities and targeted intelligence operations -- provided the initial impetus for investigations in the majority of cases while the contribution of @entity4 's bulk surveillance of phone records to these cases was minimal			1
( click to go to a database of all these 225 individuals and additional details about them			0
) so what has been the impact of @entity4 data collection ? the bulk collection of @entity6 telephone metadata -- which includes the telephone numbers that originate and receive calls as well as the time of those calls but not their content ( under @entity108 of the @entity109 ) -- appeared to have played an identifiable role in , at most , 1.8 % of these cases			1
this finding corroborated that of the @entity2 - appointed @entity115 review group , which had access to classified materials			0
that group concluded in december that " section 215 telephony metadata was not essential to preventing attacks			0
" furthermore , our examination of the role of the database of @entity6 citizens ' telephone metadata in the single plot the government used to justify the importance of the program -- that of @entity131 , a @entity133 cabdriver who in 2007 and 2008 provided $ 8,500 to @entity135 , @entity76 's affiliate in @entity136 -- calls into question the necessity of the section 215 bulk collection program			2
according to the government , the database of @entity6 phone metadata allows intelligence authorities to quickly circumvent the traditional burden of proof associated with criminal warrants , thus allowing them to " connect the dots " faster and prevent 9/11 - scale attacks			2
yet in the @entity152 case , after using the @entity4 's phone database to link a number in @entity136 to @entity152 , the @entity149 waited two months to begin an investigation and wiretap his phone			0
this finding undercut the government 's theory that the @entity4 database of @entity6 ' telephone metadata was necessary to expedite the investigative process , since it clearly did n't expedite the process in the single case the government used to extol its virtues			2
the @entity64 study concluded the surveillance of @entity6 phone metadata had no discernible impact on preventing acts of terrorism and only the most marginal of impacts on preventing terrorist - related activity , such as fundraising for a terrorist group			2
that 's why the new @entity2 proposal to end the @entity4 sucking up of the phone records of @entity6 going back half a decade is especially welcome			1
@entity179 and @entity180 helped research this article .			0

*president* @entity2 is proposing to end @entity4 bulk collection of phone records
it would require a court order to obtain phone records of individual @entity6
@entity191 : government would still be able to do *legitimate* terrorism investigations
he cites study by @entity64 that found phone records were of minimal use
