... king : [ is president @entity14 getting overexposed ] ? @entity1 : i think he is on the verge of it			1
i do think you have to be careful			0
but it is a different generation			0
[ my ] generation ... we like our celebrities			2
and i think that he realizes that because he is very much a @entity42 president			2
however , he is on the risk of alienating his older followers			0
@entity9 : does @entity14 seem like the same guy who ran against your dad ? how do you view him ? @entity1 : he 's our president and when the election was over and when president @entity14 won , all negative feelings were gone			1
@entity9 : how does your dad feel about that ? @entity1 : i think the same way			1
you know , my family is really good at letting go of things and moving on			0
and he just holds no grudges			0
@entity9 : do you think most of the people in your party agree with [ @entity64 ] @entity63 ? do they want him to fail ? @entity1 : i do n't know , because there are many different personalities within the party			1
... i would never want my president to fail , no matter which party is in power			2
@entity9 : you interviewed the [ @entity76 ] governor 's wife ? @entity1 : i interviewed [ @entity77 ] @entity9 , the first lady of @entity76			1
and she 's a fascinating woman			2

i went down and interviewed her and the piece came out today on thedailybeast.com			0
@entity9 : do you like him [ gov. @entity9 ] ? @entity1 : i do			1
you know , we do veer off on some things politically , but any leader that i 'm going to have i 'm going to veer off politically			0
@entity9 : do you consider yourself a moderate ? are you moderate liberal ? @entity1 : i consider myself a progressive @entity86			1
i am liberal on social issues			1
and i think that the party is at a place where social issues should n't be the issues that define the party			1
and i have taken heat , but in fairness to me , i am a different generation than the people that are giving me heat			0
i 'm 24 years old			0
i 'm not in my 40s , i 'm not in my 50s and older			0
@entity9 : therefore , you must , based on what you said , disagree with your father ? ... do you discuss it ? @entity1 : we have a very big generation gap between me and my father			1
yes , we discuss them			0
he 's very open - minded			2
i was raised in an open - minded home			2
i was raised a @entity110 , but i was raised open - minded @entity110 -- one to accept people , love people , not pass judgment			0
... i believe in gay marriage			2
... i personally am pro-life , but i 'm not going to judge someone that 's pro-choice			2
it is not my place to judge other people and what they do with their body			0
@entity9 : we have an e-mail question from @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 : " do you share most of your father 's political views ? " @entity1 : when it comes to war and the economy , and many fiscal conservative values , i agree with him			1
i mean i fell in love with the @entity86 because of my father			2
@entity9 : earlier this month , [ you ] wrote a @entity138 column criticizing right - wing pundit @entity139			1
conservative radio host @entity16 fired back at you , including making a comment about your weight			2
you then gave a straight talk response in an appearance on " @entity146			0
" what led to that ? @entity1 : you know , it 's so funny			1
i was in the airport today and this guy goes , " hey , @entity1 , kiss my fat ass			2
" and i was like oh my gosh			0
that 's where this has gone to			0
as far as i 'm concerned with what 's going on with @entity16 , on my end , it 's over			1
there are nine million women in this country suffering from eating disorders			0
and i 'm not going to be bullied around about my weight and what kind of standards i 'm not fitting			0
... @entity9 : were you surprised that @entity16 , who 's had breast cancer , got into something that personal ? @entity1 : i had never heard of her before until this happened			1
@entity9 : you did n't know her ? @entity1 : no. i 'm not familiar with her work			1
but i hope she does n't do it again			0
@entity9 : what about @entity139 ? @entity1 : she did n't respond , which is fine with me			1
... all i wanted to do is show women that you do n't have to be @entity139 and @entity16 to have a place in the @entity86			1
... @entity9 is a good role model , but a lot of people had n't heard of her			1
and i just want to show that you do n't have to think one way and fit into this one box in order to be a member of the @entity86			1
@entity9 : were [ your parents ] angry at @entity16 ? @entity1 : my mother was			1
she 's a very protective mama bear			0
@entity9 : are you a tattooer ? @entity1 : i have one			1
my brothers have a lot of tattoos			0
i know , you never would have thought me , right ? but i do			0
@entity9 : no. you do n't look like a tattooer			1
what do your folks think of that ? @entity1 : i 've got supportive parents , you know			2
my mom thinks it 's cute			0
... i have a little star on my foot			0
@entity9 : what kind of dad is your father ? @entity1 : he 's great			1
i love my dad so much			0
he 's the best father to me			0
and like i said , he 's so supportive of me and my career and what i do and speaking my mind			0
