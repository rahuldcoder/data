-- the grief of any parent who loses a child is unimaginable			2
but that pain is amplified now in @entity5 , due to the uncertainty over the fate of hundreds -- many of them children on a school field trip -- on a sunken ferry and how this east @entity14 nation 's culture copes with such heartache			1
for proof , one need look no further than hospital beds where some parents are hooked up to ivs because their sorrow is so great that they have refused to eat			1
some say they do n't want to live			0
families ' frustration : ' nothing is changing ' " if i do n't have my younger child , i want to jump in the sea , " one woman said			0
" thinking about my child in the sea , how can i , as a parent , eat or drink			0
i hate myself for this			0
" in @entity5 , suicide is a real threat			1
it has the highest suicide rate among the 34 countries in the @entity38			1
some point to @entity5 's ultra-competitive society or an unwillingness to accept failure as factors that contribute to this reality			1
@entity45 give out dna it is a culture where shame carries a heavy burden , and where there is simply a societal acceptance of suicide			1
officials have made mental health workers available to the families , but despite the enormity of the tragedy , they find themselves not busy			1
" no one came to us for counseling			2
the families do n't care about their safety or well - being , " said @entity60 , a psychology volunteer			0
counselors hope more people will come for help , especially in light of the high number of suicides in the country			2
there are fears that some may follow the example of @entity75 , the vice principal of @entity77 's @entity76			1
the 52 - year - old @entity75 was among the first to be rescued from the sinking ship			0
then , two days later , he was found hanging from a tree			0
police said he used a belt to apparently hang himself from a tree near a gymnasium in @entity84 , where the distraught relatives of missing passengers have been camping out			2
in a note , @entity75 wrote that the field trip had been his idea and that the deaths of the students were his fault			2
his suicide is hardly the first , nor the most high - profile , in recent memory in @entity5			1
former president @entity96 jumped to his death in 2009 in the wake of a financial scandal			0
and @entity101 chairman @entity100 leaped from a building in the midst of a corruption investigation in 2003 , ending his life			0
wherever it leads , the despair was palpable at the site where grieving family members of the capsized ferry 's passengers have been gathering			1
for some , the sadness is mixed with anger			0
as one woman , during a briefing by maritime officials , shouted : " how are we going to live now ? " families protest over rescue operation			0

parents of students missing from the sunken ferry are grieving , desperate
the students ' vice principal *killed* himself ; some fear others may do the same
@entity5 has a high suicide rate compared to other countries
mental health workers say no family members sought counseling near ferry site
