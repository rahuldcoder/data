-- buyout guys usually " run the numbers " on a takeover target before spending too much time on it			1
as takeovers go , the @entity6 looks pretty good			1
here 's a tongue - in - cheek look at how a private equity executive might sum them up for a former private equity guy			1
to : @entity12 : project november from : the @entity14 the team has finished running the numbers on @entity17 and they look really strong			1
first , if we 're successful in the upcoming auction ( they call it an election ) , we will have bought in cheap and should make a killing since the economy is improving and is likely to do so for the next four years even if we do n't do much after the takeover			1
second , it looks like we have a lot , and i mean a lot , of room to increase sales			1
i 've never seen a business with so much ability to raise prices			1
the customers ( they call them taxpayers ) have little opportunity to leave , by law they have to pay , and not many have the resources to take advantage of the tax - minimizing options in @entity43 and the @entity44			1
but the pricing structure is a total mess			0
while every other business charges premium customers more , since they have the cash and benefit most from the services , here it 's backwards			1
a lot of the premium customers , the ones who 've done really well for the last decade or two , actually pay the lowest rates ! so raising prices on these guys should be a cinch			1
and we can also get some early revenue from one - time gimmicks like drilling a million gas wells , selling non-core assets ( @entity63 ? ) , sale - and - lease - backs on real estate ( the @entity68 ? ) and more aggressive corporate partnerships ( @entity65 - @entity64 ? ) third , on the expense side things look equally promising			1
as @entity74 first discovered , a lot of the value created in takeovers can come from promise breaking and we 've got great opportunities to do that with @entity78 and @entity79			1
even better , our modeling shows that if we only break promises for younger people ( say , under 54 ) they wo n't feel any real pain until after 2016 or 2020 when we 'll already have exited the deal and been long gone			0
another easy option is to cut expenses for the poor and for kids since it turns out that they ca n't vote ( too young ) , do n't vote ( those new @entity91 rules ) , or wo n't vote for you anyway			0
( by the way , where did you get that 47 % from ? your overall figure feels about right but the team wants to double - check the calculation			2
) we also found big potential cost savings from outsourcing not just jobs but entire government departments to @entity103			2
this may be an option for lower value - added departments like @entity107 , and @entity108			0
another potential expense - cutting option is the military , but this seems a bit tricky given the whole military - industrial complex thing			2
but a takeover of the nation also presents some unique challenges compared with the smaller companies we usually target			0
first , if things get tight , we ca n't save cash by slashing long - term investments because it turns out that there are n't any			0
i know it 's unbelievable , but there just is n't much money going into the stuff that will pay off big time for competitors in the long - run : education , public transport , bridges and infrastructure , and clean / green technology			1
second , we 're unlikely to make money by restructuring or refinancing the debt			0
it 's already dirt - cheap ( we could borrow for 30 years at 3 % ) and the experts i 've spoken with are convinced that the nation really is too big to fail			2
i know you 've been through a lot of tough restructurings , think the market should be allowed to work things out , and were willing to let the auto industry go to the wall			2
but i 've pushed these guys hard and they remain adamant that if we get too close to that fiscal cliff , really bad stuff will start to happen : markets gyrating , interest rates rising , the dollar plunging , rating downgrades , you name it			2
while this type of chaos might actually be a boon to some of our hedge fund supporters , i really think we should try to avoid it			0
( and there 's no guarantee that the guys running your blind trust will have had time to bet against @entity6 before things start to unravel			1
) finally , i reviewed the nation 's shareholders agreement and bylaws ( they call it the @entity174 ) and it 's a catastrophe			2
in fact , the bottom line is that even after we take control , there will be real limits on what we can do without the support of some really crazy people			0
people who do n't appear to believe in arithmetic or science , let alone rationality and analysis			0
these guys are definitely not the @entity190 and @entity191 types we 're used to dealing with so it 's going to be a total nightmare			0
it makes me wonder whether this whole thing is really worth the hassle			0
where 's the upside ? do we really have a special insight that makes us the natural owner or are we just willing to spend more than the competition to win ? i 'm a little bit worried that we may have a touch of deal fever for another trophy on the wall			0
anyway , the model is ready so just send me your plan so i can finalize the assumptions about price hikes , expense reductions , investments and the like			0
i could n't find a copy on the server and everything in the public domain is vague and contradictory			0
my daughter 's got soccer tonight so i hope to leave the office by 7 but call my cell if you need anything else			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			1

imagine former private equity exec @entity229 *approached* election as corporate buyout
@entity226 says the buyout team would " run the numbers " on @entity6
@entity236 : since taxpayers are *captive* , there 's a lot of potential to raise " prices "
@entity236 : but unlike most businesses , the customers with the most pay the lowest rates
