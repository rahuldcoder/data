-- in the days and weeks ahead , we hope to learn more that will help us understand the tragedy that befell @entity6 sen. @entity4 and his family last week			2
on friday , @entity4 was released from the hospital four days after his son @entity11 stabbed him repeatedly before shooting himself to death			2
mental health officials initially said that after a psychological evaluation for the younger @entity4 , they had been unsuccessful in finding a bed at a psychiatric hospital for him			1
but nearby hospitals later said that they had available space but were never contacted			0
the state of @entity21 is investigating the matter and also conducting a review of state and local mental health services to determine if changes are needed			1
much is still not known about that sad incident			0
but what we do know is that mental health care is an area that remains underserved ; many who need care do not get it			1
for years , the mental health system has suffered from shortages of funding and political attention			1
of the estimated one in five people who experience a mental health challenge each year , about 60 % receive treatment			2
while the one - in - five number includes depression , anxiety , insomnia , eating disorders and substance use , it is important to note that those are the issues that people report to their doctors when they do seek help			0
sometimes these symptoms indicate that there is a more serious problem that , if treated early , it can be key to preventing a disorder from reaching a crisis or leading to disability			0
the mental health system in the @entity62 is fragmented , and reductions in public mental spending have resulted in severe shortages of services , including housing and community - based services			1
since 2008 , more than $ 4.5 billion has been cut from state budgets nationwide , and there are unmeasured challenges brought about by sequestration			0
these include reductions in block grants to the states for mental health and justice initiatives and cuts to @entity80 , which have resulted in fewer mental health counselors being hired			1
these cuts have placed even greater demands on programs that provide community treatment and crisis services			2
and while we do n't know whether these difficulties played any role in the @entity4 incident , we do know that years of discrimination toward people with mental health conditions has contributed to confusion about how to access care and often resulted in denied care			1
fortunately , there has been significant progress in removing barriers and expanding and equalizing insurance coverage			0
the @entity100 includes mental health care and substance use treatment as one of its 10 essential health benefits			1
that sends a strong message about the importance of mental health to overall health and wellness			2
coupled with the just - released final regulations for the @entity114 and @entity115 and @entity116 of 2008 , these changes will greatly improve access to care			0
we know that acute mental health inpatient services are very expensive , just as they are for the medical / surgical side of the health care equation			1
in recent years , there have been reductions in the number of community hospitals providing psychiatric care , as well as shortened stays			0
treatment is increasingly being delivered in alternative / outpatient settings , as is the case for health care in general			2
this is not necessarily a bad thing , as long as coordinated community - based treatments are available			0
community - based care , particularly when coupled with coordinated and supportive services similar to what is provided for other health conditions , produces better outcomes , helps people recover and reduces overall societal and medical costs			1
as part of their @entity149 plans , states such as @entity145 and @entity146 are offering programs that provide alternatives to traditional services			0
they not only work well , they also cost less than not providing mental health services			1
for example , rather than having people experience long waits in overcrowded emergency rooms or forcing them to travel long distances , mobile crisis services are coming to adults and children ( and their families ) in their own homes in places as diverse as rural @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 , as well as in some of the nation 's largest urban centers , including @entity172 and @entity173			0
we know that community alternatives to traditional hospitalization are proving effective			0
in @entity184 , @entity185 , with its @entity186 ; at @entity179 serving people in the counties north of @entity182 ; and in multiple sites across @entity146 , peer support and respite centers provide hospital diversion , a safe place for people in crisis and ongoing support to those at risk for a mental health crisis			1
even @entity182 has recently added crisis alternative services			0
legislators must make the commitment to restore the cuts to state mental health budgets			1
more state @entity149 plans and private insurance must add certified peer specialists to their plans to let people with state - provided nonclinical training help others stay on their medications and build social supports			0
municipalities must better coordinate their mental health services and increase the number of mobile and alternative crisis services , and all community members need to understand that mental health is essential to overall wellness			1
we know what we need to do to head off tragedies and improve the quality of life for people with mental health conditions , and their loved ones			2
we need to find the political will to ensure that we address mental health with the same degree of attention as other health conditions , and provide the means and mechanisms to pay for it			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			0
