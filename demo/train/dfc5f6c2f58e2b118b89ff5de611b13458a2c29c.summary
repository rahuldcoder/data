-- the @entity2 student at the center of a nationally publicized alcohol incident denied tuesday that he ever used an alcohol enema			1
@entity6 , 20 , admitted to reporters that he made a " bad choice " drinking last month , one that could have killed him			2
" however the scandalous accusations surrounding that event never happened and i completely deny them , " he said at a news conference			1
@entity6 , a member of the @entity15 fraternity , was hospitalized september 21 with a blood alcohol level well over 0.40 -- five times the legal limit for driving -- according to @entity19 police			1
the case made national news when police said @entity6 and some of his fraternity brothers had been using enemas containing alcohol			1
" at this point my intent is to clear my name , my fraternity 's name and to punish those individuals and institutions responsible for the lies that have been spread around the world , " @entity6 said			2
his attorney , @entity33 , said they intended to sue " whoever violated his @entity37 rights and his constitutional rights , and the list is as long as your arm			2
" experts : alcohol enemas ' extremely dangerous ' the university said tuesday it would not comment			1
@entity33 said that his client passed out and was taken to the hospital after members of the fraternity drank wine as part of a " @entity51			0

police said investigators found tubing and materials used to give alcohol enemas at the scene			1
an alcohol enema involves placing a small tube into the rectum and pouring alcohol into the colon			2

human stomachs and livers have an enzyme known as alcohol dehydrogenase that breaks down ethanol to make it less toxic for our bodies , said @entity101 gastroenterologist dr. @entity100			0
the lower gastrointestinal tract does n't have that enzyme , so alcohol molecules are absorbed into the bloodstream through the lining of the colon			0
eventually the alcohol would still make its way to the liver , @entity100 said , but the high alcohol content would overwhelm the organ			0
