-- by now , everyone knows who @entity2 is			1
but most people had never heard of the heroic and highly effective work of her fellow @entity7 winner , @entity6			1
by awarding the prize jointly to both of them , the @entity9 made an inspired choice			2
the win by @entity2 , who has become a global icon and a symbol of courage and of the rights of girls to an education , was expected , even demanded by the public			1
in contrast , @entity6 , a children 's rights and anti-slavery activist , is known mostly in the world of human rights defenders			1
it 's time his story started inspiring all of us			2
the two are , above all , enemies of injustice			2
and while @entity2 's young life has dazzled the world in a short time , @entity6 , 60 , has already spent decades working to combat the shocking reality that even today , millions of children are forced to work in slavery , often to pay off their parents ' debts , enduring exploitation and trafficking			1
as noted by @entity42 , the head of the @entity43 , the shared @entity44 , awarded to an @entity45 and a @entity46 , a @entity47 and a @entity48 -- natives of two countries that have gone to war with each other -- sends a strong message of reconciliation			2
but if @entity2 's uncommon courage is difficult to replicate -- she redoubled her efforts after being shot in the head by the @entity59 -- @entity6 's life is a reminder that there is a potential hero hiding within every human being			1
and it underscores how as individuals we do n't have to accept the wrongs we see in the world as if they were inescapable and unchangeable			2
@entity6 is said to have been only 6 years old when he noticed a boy on the steps at his school			1
but this boy was working shining shoes			2
this was , according to @entity6 , when his conscience was awoken			1
by the time he was 11 , as one writer notes , he was pushing his classmates to donate their textbooks to the poor and their parents to help pay school fees for those who could n't afford them			0
there was always a profoundly practical aspect to his activism			0
it was about getting results			0
@entity6 eventually became an electrical engineer , but he decided to leave that behind and dedicate himself to something he believed was more important , and he started working to free the so - called " bonded laborers , " essentially slaves forced to work to pay off debts			1
in 1980 , he founded @entity95 , @entity96 , to rescue and protect children from servitude and trafficking			0
he built an ashram , the @entity101 , to teach new skills to former slave workers , so they could become self - sufficient after gaining their freedom			0
@entity95 started as a direct - action group and evolved into the cornerstone of a global movement to free children from slave labor and give them the chance of having not just a real childhood but also the chance of a decent life			0
according to the @entity115 , it grew to have more than 80,000 people and 750 member organizations			0
by some counts they have freed more than 75,000 children from servitude and have raised awareness of the problem and developed a wide - ranging strategy to solve it			0
child labor -- modern slavery -- is now recognized internationally as a fundamental human rights challenge			0
@entity6 's @entity128 and the @entity129 have chapters throughout the world , with thousands of members working to influence and ultimately persuade governments , businesses and consumers to stop illegal labor practices			1
they also help develop international conventions on children 's rights so that what is clearly immoral is also designated as illegal			0
they have , to put it quite simply , made a difference			0
@entity2 and @entity6 stand as symbols of the crucial role individuals must play to address the urgent issues of our time			1
their joint @entity7 reminds us that in the great struggles unfolding today , the fight against extremism , the oppression and exploitation of women , the battle between competing ideologies , all of us can make the choice			1
everyone can become a hero .			0
