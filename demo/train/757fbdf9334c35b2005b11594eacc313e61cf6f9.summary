while president @entity1 has reignited a national conversation over rising college costs with his new proposals , those suggestions are unlikely to dramatically lower costs soon			1
and the president has not given many specific suggestions how to cut these costs that have been rising dramatically faster than people 's income			1
tuition fees are roughly double the share of income then they were in the 1960s			1
let me offer five suggestions on how to lower post-secondary educational costs			1
this list is not comprehensive , but full implementation of even some of them could reduce the burden that colleges impose on students , parents and taxpayers			1
first , adopt the three - year bachelor 's degree as in @entity26			1
students at prestigious schools like @entity29 and @entity30 receive their degrees in three years , and they still get first - class jobs			1
@entity33 returns sets into collegiate study like anything else , and much of the material in the last two years of college is of marginal importance , with the possible exception of some demanding majors such as engineering and architecture			1
the feds could simply say undergraduate student eligibility for financial assistance ends after 90 semester hours of study			0
this approach should reduce the cost of a @entity51 degree by something on the order of 25 %			1
a less cost - saving variant of the three - year plan would keep the degree at its traditional 120 semester hour length , but have students go to school year - round for three years			1
we really do n't need the summer off to plant crops as people did hundreds of years ago			1
@entity62 would get greater utilization , lowering capital costs			1
college graduates would gain an extra year working full - time			1
@entity66 usually will teach additional courses for far less than the average pay per course taught regularly			0
maintenance costs of facilities per student would also fall			1
second , make it possible for students to use @entity75 ( massively open online courses ) and other low - cost , online options , allowing for lower cost " blended " degrees combining perhaps two years of traditional classroom experience with an equal amount of online training			1
this would cut the cost of quality degrees perhaps 40 %			1
without any governmental involvement , teachers and entrepreneurs have brought hundreds of high - quality but free or low - cost courses to the internet -- @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 are examples of a few providers or facilitators of quality instruction			1
yet students seldom get credit for these courses			0
the barriers are not technological , but legal or involve overcoming special interest obstruction			0
students need to be examined on the online material , with safeguards assuring the registered student is actually being tested			2
obstacles to accrediting these innovative approaches need to be overcome			0
the federal government , which accredits the accreditation agencies , could tell these agencies they must allow accredited schools to accept as much as 60 % of coursework from @entity75 or related providers			0
the federal government ca n't deliver the mail or run a national medical care system efficiently , so they should not be the prime mover here			0
where is the @entity124 or @entity125 when we need them ? third , offer a traditional residential degree for 40 % less by dramatically reducing labor and capital costs			2
the typical university employs twice as many " professional non-instructional personnel " ( administrators ) per 100 students as it did 40 years ago			1
why not create new universities with staffing near the 1970 norms -- a university without sustainability and diversity coordinators or an army of public relations specialists , where faculty teach extensively rather than do trivial research that no one reads , and where there are no expensive intercollegiate athletic programs for the amusement of non-students			0
specifically , ask the faculty to teach four classes per semester instead of two or three			0
build few buildings but utilize them extensively , including on fridays , weekends and summer months			0
have a least two faculty members for each administrator ( the ratio now is often one to one )			0
prohibit faculty from teaching trivial courses in their specialty			2
do we really need courses on " @entity161 and the @entity162 " taught to students who are clueless about @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 ? limit the pay of all employees to no more than that of the president of the @entity171 or less			2
could existing universities do this ? they have n't , so state governments might have to create new institutions from the ground up			0
fourth , create a @entity178 similar to the high school ged			0
a good national test of basic reading , writing , mathematical and general knowledge about our institutions and society could be administered by , say , the @entity187 , or @entity188			0
high scores on the test would lead to a " college equivalence certificate			2
" most students want a diploma as a ticket to a good job			0
employers could use scores on the equivalency test as an alternative certification device , and individuals could take the test anytime -- even home schooled kids with little formal education			0
fifth , get the federal government out of the student financial aid business			0
there is good evidence the 11.7 % annual growth in federal student financial aid over the past decade ( and similar growth earlier ) has encouraged colleges to raise tuition fees and finance a costly academic arms race			2
lower income americans are a smaller proportion of recent college graduates than in 1970 , before @entity216 began			2
if we implement the first four reforms , the need for student financial assistance will dramatically decline			0
the current system breeds high dropout rates , rewards poor performance ( students lingering in school get more aid than those graduating promptly ) and encourages kids to enter college who would be better off entering trade schools or apprentice programs			2
ending these inefficient federal programs would save tens of billions annually			0
in short , there are lots of thing we can do to make colleges more affordable beyond the president 's idea of providing good consumer information by rating colleges .			2

president @entity1 is proposing steps to reduce costs of college
@entity249 says more useful steps would include shortening college to three years
he says the number of administrators has grown too much , other costs could be cut
@entity249 : year - round schooling and online teaching would do much to reduce tuition
