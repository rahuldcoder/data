-- it 's one of the most mocked fonts on the @entity3 , the target of numerous campaigns and websites that believe its " comical " design has no place in civilized society			0
now , @entity10 has gone analog with the " @entity12 , " a typewriter that types letters in @entity10			1
the idea came to @entity18 designer @entity16 one night in september , when he was lying in bed reading a comic that used a typewriter - style font in its lettering			1
" it just struck me there was nothing stopping me from making a typewriter that could use a different font , " he said			0
why do it ? it 's hard to say , exactly			0
but it 's the kind of project that interests @entity16 , an artist and educator who leads classes in laser - cutting and engraving at a digital media studio for a living			1
through his job he had access to tools to etch letters out of acrylic and glue them onto the strikers of an old @entity46 typewriter he found on the street years ago			2
he could have used any font , but he chose @entity10 " to provoke a reaction			1
" " if i 'd made it in @entity54 people would 've just observed it as a little design experiment , " he said in a phone interview saturday			2
instead , by altering a classic machine to type one of the most polarizing fonts , he hopes to make people think about how they consume , generate and store media			1
it appears to be working			0
reaction on his @entity64 video has been mixed and extreme , much like feelings over the much - maligned font			0
the @entity68 website urges people to take the " @entity72 " to seriously consider whether it is " an appropriate font choice " before using it in any printed work			2
" @entity16 has contemplated use of media in previous projects			1
as a @entity78 graduate student , he printed the pages of an @entity80 to create a bound book			0
he also leads @entity64 tutorials on how to write in different fonts to show people that they can " retrain themselves " to use media differently from how they were taught in school			1
he insists he 's not a luddite : he uses a smartphone and the cloud , and he appreciates the benefits of the digital age			0
but he worries that our fetishism of nostalgia and " homage to older standards in unquestioned fashion " is misguided at times			2
he also worries about policies and governments that restrict access to digital media			0
" it 's great that we can store our own content in the cloud and access email anywhere , " he said			0
" what i want to avoid is the ability to have control over my media life being removed			0
" so , what does that have to do with a @entity10 typewriter ? " i sincerely want people to consume and generate and make media in a considered fashion , " he said			1
as for those who despise the @entity12 as much as the font , he has a reminder : nothing is permanent			1
" if need be those stickers can come off the keys and the @entity10 covers can come off the strikers , and the machine would be as good as new			2
