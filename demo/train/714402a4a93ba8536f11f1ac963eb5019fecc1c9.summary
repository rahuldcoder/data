it 's been less than one week since celebrities and die - hard @entity4 fans packed the @entity119 in @entity34 for an emotional farewell to the @entity4 questions still surround the circumstances of his sudden death less than three weeks before the scheduled start of his @entity1 shows			1
investigators are still awaiting toxicology reports from the coroner 's to determine the exact cause of death			2

" there is a high level of demand			0
it 's apparent that fans really want the official merchandise , " a spokesman for @entity157 told @entity2			2
the race to generate income following @entity4 's death , from offering commemorative tickets in lieu of refunds to his concerts to the sale of t - shirts and cds , has rankled some of his fans			1

it 's about a man whose life has gone			0
and he touched a lot of people as well , including myself , " @entity195 told @entity2			0
