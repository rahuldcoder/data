-- when the @entity2 sent a tweet monday filled with garbled nonwords like " tpfccdlfdtte , " the @entity1 was confused , and intrigued			1
was the @entity2 drunk ? had a cat skittered across someone 's keyboard ? or maybe the spy agency , under fire for eavesdropping on @entity12 , had accidentally blurted a secret of its own -- a coded , classified message not meant for public eyes			1
the truth proved to be less scandalous			0
internet sleuths , armed with cryptogram - solving web tools , solved the mystery in minutes			1
turns out the nonsensical tweet was a coded recruiting pitch by the @entity2 , which is seeking code breakers to help decipher encrypted messages from potential terrorists			1
the tweet was a basic " substitution cipher , " a code in which each letter of the alphabet is replaced by another			0
translated , it read ( @entity33 for all you wannabe codebreakers ) : " want to know what it takes to work at @entity2 ? check back each monday in may as we explore careers essential to protecting our nation			2
" when contacted by @entity0 , @entity2 spokeswoman @entity41 said the @entity43 account is run by the @entity2 recruitment office , which will post coded tweets each monday for the rest of the month			1
" @entity2 is known as the code makers and code breakers , " said @entity41 , who called the tweet " part of our recruitment efforts to attract the best and the brightest			1
" if the intelligence agency wanted attention , it worked			1
monday 's message has been retweeted more than 1,100 times , and most major media outlets have run articles about it			0
in its efforts to attract top talent , the @entity2 has been known to recruit hackers and other computer wizards at cybersecurity conferences			2
the agency even set up a special page to woo attendees of @entity68 , a shadowy hackers ' conference held each july in @entity69			0
a job with the @entity2 requires a security clearance , of course			2
but the agency seems eager to recruit smart people -- even , perhaps , those with minor arrest records			0
" if you have a few , shall we say , indiscretions in your past , do n't be alarmed			0
you should n't automatically assume you wo n't be hired , " said the recruiting page			0
" if you 're really interested , you owe it to yourself to give it a shot			0
" the @entity2 receives thousands of applications a month and is on target to meet its hiring goals for the current fiscal year , @entity41 said			2
@entity88 , who wrote a book about the @entity2 , told @entity0 last year that @entity2 hackers focus on foreign militaries , governments and corporations , and are protected by multiple levels of secrecy			2
monday 's tweet was not the first time the @entity2 has sent a coded message on @entity43			1
the agency has posted three already this year to celebrate holidays , such as @entity101			0
but it might signal a renewed effort by the embattled agency to attract new blood in the wake of revelations last year by leaker @entity108			0
documents leaked by @entity108 showed the @entity2 ran a secret surveillance program to intercept @entity12 ' phone calls and internet messages .			1
