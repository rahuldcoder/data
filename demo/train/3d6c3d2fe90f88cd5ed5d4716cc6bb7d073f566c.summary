-- " we are not animals , we are on a whole different level to that			2
" so claims @entity5 ( @entity6 ) , who describes himself as " many things , " including a writer , doctor , a nuclear physicist , and a theoretical philosopher , but also assumes the more presumptuous role of guru and spiritual teacher , even prophet			1
if you 've heard anything about " the master , " @entity17 's long - awaited follow up to the magnificent " @entity25 , " you will know that @entity21 is reportedly based on sci - fi novelist and @entity24 founder @entity23			1
@entity6 suggests someone more professorial than preacher : an @entity29 sophisticate with a @entity31 faith in scientific methodology ; charismatic , kindly , even utopian , but a charlatan whether he admits it to himself or not			1
he steadfastly believes in a better world , a higher calling , just so long as it gravitates around him ( and always has )			1
ironically , " @entity37 " does n't			2
@entity21 is by some stretch the secondary role in the film			2
the protagonist is one @entity42 ( @entity43 ) , an @entity44 of an especially disheveled , even wretched sort , a lost soul and a drifter who serves in the @entity48 during @entity49 and ca n't get his act together once the war is over			1
@entity52 looks skinnier and more gaunt than in his last film , when he played a grotesque , creatively exhausted version of himself in the faux - documentary " @entity57			1
" that was two years ago , and one reason to celebrate " @entity37 " is simply because it gives us another chance to marvel at this superb actor			0
his hair flecked with gray , sneery and sinewy , @entity52 resembles @entity65 and @entity66 : postwar stars who embodied the anxieties and alienation of the returning gis in male melodramas tinged in varying shades of noir			0
@entity42 is a ball of nervous energy , agitated and intense , so bottled up with sexual frustration he 's ready to pop. he funnels his aggravation into the manufacture of hooch , lovingly concocted from diesel fuel , or paint thinner , or photo chemicals , and imbibed at your own risk			0
a stowaway on @entity21 's borrowed pleasure steamer , @entity42 intrigues the older man : he 's the savage beast , a test case for his theories of psychological and spiritual advancement			0
but there 's more to it than that			0
@entity94 shares @entity42 's taste for raw alcohol			0
they are drinking buddies as well as doctor and patient , master and servant , messiah and acolyte ... perhaps even soul mates			0
their relationship disturbs and perplexes @entity21 's loyal disciples , including his formidable wife ( @entity108 ) , who considers @entity42 beyond saving but fears that her husband could go the other way			2
over the course of several years each man will disappoint the other , yet they struggle to sever whatever it is that binds them			0
the most classically minded of @entity118 's young filmmakers , and the most prodigious , @entity17 draws on @entity119 and @entity120 , @entity121 's " @entity124 " and @entity127 ' " a place in the @entity126 " even more than in " @entity25 , " " @entity37 " demonstrates a remarkable lucidity and assurance			1
who knows ? it may prove to be one of the last movies ever shot and shown on 70mm , but @entity17 does n't go in for epic vistas or the proverbial cast of thousands			0
the camerawork is artfully composed -- each frame designed with intelligence and care -- but also fluid and self - effacing			2
it 's a long movie , but one that feels cut to the bone			2
@entity17 makes his points so succinctly , and with such subtlety , not a few viewers at the @entity144 admitted they felt it would require a second viewing to catch up with it			1
fans of this director -- who has previously gone in for more flamboyant gestures -- may even feel a little disappointed			0
there 's nothing quite so grandstanding as @entity155 's infamous milkshake scene , no oil rigs bursting into flame and frogs do n't fall from the sky			0
but still , this film examines a not dissimilar dynamic to the " @entity25 " love - hate between the priest and the killer , and imbues it with greater sensitivity and depth			1
where @entity155 's @entity25 thirsted for black gold , @entity42 has a far different and more reasonable hunger : for love , and peace , just enough to get through this world straight			1
far and away the best @entity118 movie unveiled at @entity144 , " @entity37 " also has @entity175 muscle in its marketing			1
it 's still five months to @entity178 night , but it will be a surprise if this does n't earn nominations across the board , with @entity52 a front - runner for best actor and @entity6 just a step behind him			1
in the end it may not have the emotional uplift the @entity178 or a popular mainstream audience craves , but make no mistake , this is an enthralling drama about a peculiarly @entity118 restlessness , and the striving for insight and grace .			0

@entity6 and @entity43 play characters with a complex relationship
the film is the long - awaited follow - up to " @entity25 "
