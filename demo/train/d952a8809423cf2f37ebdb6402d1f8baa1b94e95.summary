@entity0 -- " i 'm 6 - feet , 3 - inches tall and 230 pounds , just like @entity3			1
do i scare you ? " sen. @entity5 , @entity6 , posted a photograph wednesday of a column he wrote after the brutal 1992 beating of @entity3 , an @entity9 , and subsequent acquittal of the accused police officers , who were all white			1
in the newspaper essay , @entity5 -- one of two african - americans currently serving in the @entity13 -- blends his own first - person experience and that of @entity3 into a stream - of - consciousness column analyzing @entity19 race relations			1

@entity5 responded by saying , " @entity30 , i wrote this at 22			1
i remember how angry i was			0
and yes it was more than that			0
it was pain / hurt			0
@ @entity36 , " along with the attached image of a yellowed newspaper column			1

quickly , his experience escalates into one that many young black men in @entity19 are familiar with : five police cars surrounded him , six officers approached him with guns drawn and demanded to see his documents			0
why was he pulled over , in his telling ? " oh , you fit the description of a car thief			0
" @entity5 had just graduated from @entity57 and was awarded the prestigious @entity58 at the time of the incident			2

" am i a threat ? does your fear justify your actions ? twelve people believed it did , " @entity5 wrote			1
similarly to recent events in @entity28 , the @entity71 was called into @entity72 to quell the riots in 1992			1

help us to help ourselves before we become our own undoing			0
" @entity5 is already known for his rapid - fire use of the social media site to address constituent concerns and trolls alike , and used the opportunity to discuss what he calls " transformational criminal justice reform & drug policy reform , " which he plans to lead with sen. @entity89 , @entity90 .			1
