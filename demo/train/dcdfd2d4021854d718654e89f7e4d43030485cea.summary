@entity0 , @entity1 -- with the late evening sun casting a dramatic light across the 65th floor of an empty @entity0 office block , everything was primed for a spectacular entrance from @entity0 filmmaker @entity9			1
director @entity9 : hardboiled on the outside , soft on the inside			1
with the scene set and cameras ready , the lift doors opened on cue			2
but instead of the director appearing , perhaps with a spectacular pyrotechnic backdrop or with a motif dove , out stepped one of the building 's security guards wondering what a @entity2 film crew was doing filming an empty building			1
it turned out the 63 - year old director was embroiled in another dramatic scene on the other side of town , commonly known as " @entity0 @entity31			1
" we were assured @entity33 was n't involved in the hold up			2
by the time @entity9 did make it to the interview the sun was setting , but regardless of the scene or location , the unassuming 5 - foot 5 - inch tall director still casts an impressive shadow over international action cinema			1
from @entity0 - based " gun fu " flicks of the 1980s and ' 90s , to @entity46 blockbusters like " @entity47 " @entity9 has made a reputation as a master of stylish gangster films and thrillers			1
his latest release , " @entity53 : @entity57 " , an epic - historical action film set in @entity58 - era @entity1 , marked his return to @entity1 and a simpler method of making films			1
" even though i enjoyed the opportunity to work in @entity46 , i never got used to their system			1
i did n't like much of the studio people			1
well , there are too much politics and so much going on , and a lot of them have nothing to do with the movie			2
it 's all about power , it 's all about egos , " @entity9 told @entity2			2
@entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 are just a few of the a-list egos he has had to deal with in front of the camera			2
however directing actors , even a demanding @entity70 , is a pleasure not a problem for the self - effacing @entity9 , who admits his directing style is controlled and quite reserved			0
" sometimes he [ @entity70 ] gave me so many suggestions about the camera ( and ) about the scene			0
and then i knew he just wanted to be good			1
so then i just walked up to him , ' @entity70 just believe me , i will make you look great			0
' and then he had so much confidence [ in me ] and then he kept quiet and let me do my work			0
i did make him look good , " he said with a chuckle			0
" @entity72 is such a nice man			0
when working with him , i just feel like i am talking to @entity88			1
when i worked with @entity71 , it just made me feel like i am working with chow yun - fat			1
i think we have the same kind of emotion , the same kind of passion about life , about movies			0
" chow yun - fat , a superstar in his own right across @entity100 , dropped out of @entity9 's " @entity53 " just days before shooting began			1
however , it appears that no matter who he works with or where , @entity9 's passion for film - making and movies will never diminish , and he admits he still thinks of chow yun - fat as a good friend			1
at one point during the interview -- speaking about choosing the right guns as props for his 1987 film , " @entity115 " -- @entity9 reveals his almost child - like glee in putting together his shots and scenes			1
@entity9 's own childhood was spent in @entity121 , at that time one of the more insalubrious parts of the city , and cinemas and theatres provided both escapism and a physical escape from the violence and " hell " of life on the streets			1
" i had to fight to survive			0
whenever i got beat up , i got upset , i also ran into the theater to watch a movie			0
but i have a very strong character , i never surrender , i ( am ) never afraid , no matter how big they are , how cruel they are , they never beat me down			0
" i did n't have money			0
i just sneaked in or watched the movie from the peephole			0
i have found my heaven in musicals			1
when i watch a musical , it makes me believe life is still beautiful			0
there are still a lot of beautiful people in the world			0
so i like the costumes , i love the song , i love all those smiles , i love those dance			0
in theater i found my heaven , " he said			2
a religious man , @entity158 symbolism often appears in his films ; he almost devoted his life to the church as a priest , but was dissuaded by the minister college			2
" they encouraged me to go for art. they did n't believe i could be a good minister			2
they just said , ' @entity9 you are so artistic , you just go for your art , do n't come back			0
' i am grateful they knew me better , " he said			0
it was n't quite divine intervention , but no doubt millions of fans of his explosive cinematic style will be just as grateful he was persuaded to pick the directors chair over the pulpit .			0
