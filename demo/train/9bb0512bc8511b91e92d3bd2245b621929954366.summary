-- actress @entity1 appears on the cover of the november issue of @entity4 , now on newsstands			1
she is radiant ; glowing and fairly ageless in that way that , one has come to suspect , only professional photo editing can achieve , although @entity1 has objected to digital manipulation of her image in the past			1
still , much ado has been made of the fact that @entity1 is pregnant with her third child during the shoot -- but it 's impossible to tell			1
on the cover , only her face is visible ; inside , her body is shrouded in layers of thick fabrics			0
but pregnant ? aside from the maternal wrapping of her hands around her nonexistent belly , not particularly			2
the publishing industry has a history of putting pregnant celebrities on magazine covers and featuring them in fashion shoots			1
naturally , these women are made to look flawlessly chic and as comfortable as ever in their skin , two characteristics not typically associated with the very physical nine months of carrying a child			0
@entity33 photographed by @entity34 was , of course , the pioneer of this particular genre of cover modeling when she posed naked -- aside from some giant jewels and an aloof expression -- for the cover of @entity41 back in 1991			0
it 's an image that 's inspired countless others , with magazines recreating the look since then with celebrities such as @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			0
and the bodies keep getting better : at least @entity34 , or @entity41 , let @entity33 retain a bit of realistic cellulite			0
but by the time we got to supermodel @entity55 , naked and pregnant in @entity56 in 2010 , it was official : pregnancy is just regular life , albeit with a slightly rounded tummy			0
and so it goes this month , both with @entity1 and with @entity61 , who is seen posing for the cover of @entity63 in a dress with a hip - high slit looking both very pregnant and very trim			1
the cover elicited such raves as " @entity61 is flawless ! " and indeed she is , enviably , almost impossibly , so			0
putting aside the now - standard practice of electronically " perfecting " already gorgeous women for the purpose of selling magazines , there is something particularly dangerous about depicting pregnant women in such a way			1
one might argue that these magazines are celebrating a woman 's natural shape during a beautiful time in her life			2
but is it a celebration ? or an exploitation ? the fact is that it 's the rare instance in which a female celebrity larger than a size 4 is put on the cover of a magazine , especially a fashion magazine			2
when she is , it 's often because the magazine is running a " special issue " -- or because she 's expecting			1
in 2003 , for example , @entity4 put a pregnant @entity96 on the cover for its shape issue			1
but pregnancy is n't a shape ; not exactly			2
it is , however , to hear these magazines tell it -- or , rather , to see them depict it -- pretty damn glamorous			0
the message : @entity106 is ok when you 're expecting and photoshopped to glowing perfection : after all , it 's only temporary			1
otherwise , forget about it			0
consider @entity112 's current issue , which features six different cover celebrities as part of its annual " women in @entity117 " theme			2
one is actress @entity118 , who looks gorgeous in an enormous @entity120 coat , as the other cover actresses are shown in form - fitting dresses or various states of undress			0
how come we do n't get to see @entity118 's bumps the way we do @entity128 's ? of course , women respond differently to pregnancy			1
perhaps these female celebrities , who are indisputably genetically blessed , look no different posing pregnant than they do when they 're not expecting			1
perhaps , but not likely			0
what 's likely , though , is the message society is getting : that ease and beauty in pregnancy are the norm			0
by unequivocally depicting expectant women as beautiful and glowing and ready for a night out in a tight dress , these magazines set up unrealistic expectations for both pregnancy and motherhood , neither of which is easy , beautiful , or picture - perfect , at least not all the time			2
proof of shifting expectations has already emerged , and society has indeed come to expect a certain level of beauty from its pregnant stars			0
though @entity152 is generally admired for having a body that does not succumb to the @entity117 ideal , she received constant negative press throughout her pregnancy for her weight gain ; for not being , at all times , " cover - worthy			0
" people , with the help of the media , seem to forget that pregnant women change shape , and that 's a wonderful , natural thing that need n't be covered up or defended or cloaked in haute couture			1
it need n't always look perfect , because when is it , really ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .			1

@entity170 : @entity1 on @entity4 is pregnant but it 's impossible to tell
@entity170 : pregnant celebs on magazine covers look flawless , skinny with a bump
@entity170 : it says big is ok only when you 're expecting and photoshopped to perfection
in reality , she says , women change shape and do n't look perfect , and that 's fine
