moments after breastfeeding her baby , @entity0 was shot in the head			1
packed into a truck with about 60 other men , women and children , she was on her way to long hoped - for safety when the militants emerged , guns spitting bullets , from the thick jungle of the @entity11			1
hers was n't the only life lost to the attackers			0
a man named @entity17 , traveling with his wife , brother and son , was also shot and killed in a separate ambush			1
our truck was no. 9 in a convoy of 20 carrying some 1,300 muslims fleeing the ethnic violence tearing the country apart			1
the convoy had set off from the capital , @entity30 , two days earlier			1
its passengers , many carrying amulets intended to protect the wearer from danger , perched atop piles of mats , sacks and pieces of wood , the sides of the truck festooned with brightly colored water containers			2
the long line of trucks was headed up north , snaking its way 375 miles across the country on a hard , dangerous journey from the tropical @entity11 forest to the open savannah bordering @entity50			1
the journey was not made by choice			2
bitter fighting between @entity54 and @entity56 militia groups since a coup last year has claimed many lives and displaced hundreds of thousands of people			1
but after four months trapped in a 500 - meter stretch of road by a mosque in @entity30 , under threat from the militia groups roaming nearby , it offered these families a chance at freedom from what had become an open - air prison			1
riding on the truck with them promised to give a close - up view of the dangers they faced en route			2
too risky to stop as the bullets crack through the air , all of us on truck no. 9 duck down , trying to cover our heads			0
a man with blood on his shirt stands up after the shooting			0
he is calling for help -- some of the people are injured			2
but for a while the huge convoy keeps on going			2
it is simply too risky to stop			0
the breastfeeding mother is now dying at the man 's feet			2
about 10 minutes after it stops , a military doctor finally reaches her			0
he has been traveling with the @entity100 military escort provided by the @entity11 - led @entity101 to the @entity11 ( @entity102 )			2
its vehicles are scattered through the convoy but can not cover the whole strung - out line of trucks as it rumbles along the red dirt road			1
the attackers , meanwhile , have melted back into the forest			0
the @entity100 flag carried by the @entity102 soldiers is a reminder of the slaughter that scarred their homeland two decades ago			0
now they witness another @entity11 nation collapsing amid ethnic division			0
the doctor tends to several people who were injured but @entity0 , although still breathing , is mortally wounded			1
someone removes the amulet she has attached to her waist			0
when they bundle her onto a mat and move her from one side of the truck to the other , the women , children and an old man nearby cover their faces and let out cries			0
in addition to the baby , she was traveling with another daughter , aged perhaps seven or eight			2
the other women on the truck , heads covered and dressed in bold , printed fabrics , take over the care of the two children			0
the ambush came around midday			0
@entity0 's body remains in the truck for the next six hours and is buried when the convoy stops for the night in @entity147			1
also buried is @entity148 , who was killed in front of his family in a second attack , presumably by the same militiamen , on a vehicle further back in the convoy			1
only in @entity147 , where the convoy can move into a @entity102 compound , can all the passengers climb down from the trucks for the first time in two days			1
@entity160 turns to shock the ambush was all the crueler because just a few minutes earlier , the convoy had reached @entity164 -- the first area controlled by the @entity165 , a predominantly @entity54 group			2
as the convoy of displaced @entity54 passed through , the first @entity54 militiamen appeared , welcoming them with cheers and waves			1
" we are safe now , no more worries , " @entity171 said , smiling , as he greeted the militiamen from his perch on top of truck no. 9			0
" the worst is behind , " he said , meaning the 185 miles of road dotted with hostile anti-balaka , as the @entity56 militia are known , in our wake			1
but the joy did n't last long			0
@entity164 is currently one of the " hot areas " in the country 's savage inter-communal conflict -- and the @entity56 militia were lying in wait for the convoy outside the town			1
after the shock of the ambush lay more long miles of travel fraught with hardship and peril			0
the convoy spent a third night in @entity195 , where some passengers left to join family members or to settle in a newly created camp for internally displaced persons			1
the last day ended at another such camp near the town of @entity202 , just shy of the border with @entity50			0
five babies were born en route , including two sets of twins			0
after four days on the road , there was no food to greet the new arrivals			0
genocide fears the country began its descent into chaos in march 2013 , after a coalition of mostly @entity54 rebels known as @entity165 ousted president @entity218			0
they have since been forced from power , but @entity56 and @entity54 militias have continued to battle for control			1
to counter attacks on @entity56 communities by @entity165 groups , the vigilante groups known as the anti-balaka , which translates to " anti-machete , " fought back			1
as the situation has spiraled out of control , life in an already dirt - poor , unstable country has only become more hazardous			2
at least 2,000 people have died in the fighting , and 2.2 million others -- about half the country 's population -- need humanitarian aid , according to the @entity238			1
hundreds of thousands have been displaced both within the country and beyond its borders			1
the continuing violence has raised the specter of genocide , as occurred 20 years ago in @entity100			0
" do not repeat the mistakes of the past -- heed the lessons , " @entity238 @entity245 ban ki - moon said last month on a visit to @entity30			1
as communities have fractured , @entity56 and @entity54 minorities have become increasingly threatened			1
aid workers have also been caught up in the violence			0
the medical charity @entity254 , or @entity254 , said this week it is reducing its operations in the country for at least a week after an attack on staff , patients and local authorities in one of its hospitals left 16 civilians dead			2
' they will regret it ' the 1,300 - strong group that left @entity30 on april 27 had been trapped in an area of the capital known as @entity269 for the previous four months			1
surrounded by anti-balaka militia members , they could n't venture out to seek food or medical help , and were killed if they were caught leaving the area			1
even within the enclave , they were subject to grenade attacks and shootings			0
in response to their pleas for help , the convoy to the north was organized by the @entity285 and other @entity286			1
now only one @entity54 enclave remains in @entity30 : @entity288 , where clashes , incidents and violence occur almost every day			1
the capital is not the only place where isolated ethnic groups now live in fear			2
while @entity54 are under threat in the south - west , in the north - east it 's @entity54 militias who rule and the @entity300 who are targeted			1
the mayor of @entity30 , @entity303 , was installed as interim president earlier this year			1
but the prospect of restoring peace to the country seems to be receding with each new attack			2
while international peacekeeping forces are in the country -- some 6,000 @entity312 troops and 2,000 @entity314 forces , as well as the first contingent of 1,600 @entity317 troops -- their ability to police remote communities is limited			0
the @entity238 has promised as many as 10,000 military personnel by september 15 , which may help expand their operations			2
but the challenge is great and it may be too late			0
as a local journalist said , troops may be deployed but the real issue is that of reconciliation among communities			0
the conflict can not heal without the now - divided society coming together			0
even as the convoy of @entity54 traveled north toward @entity331 , many of the men and young people packed onto the trucks spoke freely of their anger and desire for revenge			1
" we will be back and they will regret it			0
we will finish with them			0
they will regret to have been treating us as animals and have kicked us out of our own country , " said one 17 - year - old civilian			0
perhaps he , like others before him , will soon be a @entity165 fighter too			0
the string of terrible atrocities carried out by both @entity54 and @entity56 militias as this violent divorce between communities plays out makes it hard to see a road back .			2

some 1,300 muslims *undertake* a 375 - mile journey from the capital , @entity30 , to the north
