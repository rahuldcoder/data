@entity0 -- president @entity2 met tuesday with @entity3 and emerged to say @entity4 was " on the precipice " of passing a sweeping health care reform bill			1
" there are some differences that still have to be worked on , " @entity2 said after talks with @entity3 trying to push their bill through the @entity3			1
but " there is broad consensus around [ a set of ] reforms			0
" @entity2 spoke after @entity16 sen. @entity15 indicated he was prepared to back reform legislation on condition that the bill drops both a controversial government - run public health insurance option and a provision allowing 55 - to 64 - year - olds to buy into @entity24			1
if the public option and @entity24 buy - in are removed from the bill , " then i 'm going to be in a position where i can say ... that i 'm ready to vote for health care reform , " @entity15 told reporters on @entity26			1
in a later interview with @entity1 , @entity15 said he was " moving very much in the direction of saying yes , pending just seeing what i 've been told is happening with the bill			2
" an independent who caucuses with the @entity3 , @entity15 has emerged as the main obstacle to the majority party 's efforts to get the health care bill passed by the @entity3 before @entity42			1
he threatened over the weekend to join a @entity44 filibuster if the legislation contains either the public option or the @entity24 expansion			2
unanimous @entity44 opposition to health care legislation so far means @entity3 need the backing of all 60 members of their caucus to end debate on the bill and move to a final vote			2
final @entity3 passage of the bill would then require only a simple majority of 51 votes			2
@entity3 held an emergency meeting monday night to discuss the issue , then gathered with @entity2 on tuesday afternoon to hear the president 's opinion			1
" the final bill wo n't include everything that everybody wants			2
no bill can do that , " @entity2 said afterward			2
" but what i told my former colleagues today is that we simply can not allow differences over individual elements of this plan to prevent us from meeting our responsibility to solve a longstanding and urgent problem for the @entity78 people			0
" @entity2 insisted " any fair reading " of the @entity3 bill showed it meets the administration 's criteria of lowering costs and expanding coverage while not adding to the federal deficit			1
former @entity89 gov. @entity88 -- a former presidential candidate and past head of the @entity91 -- ripped the decision to eliminate the public option and the @entity24 expansion			1
" this is essentially the collapse of health care reform in the @entity3 and , honestly , the best thing to do right now is kill the @entity3 bill and go back to the @entity100 , " @entity88 said in an interview with @entity96 posted on its web site			1
in his interview with @entity1 , @entity15 acknowledged he angered some of his colleagues , but said he was acting on principle , not politics			0
" i knew some of them were upset about positions i 'd taken , " @entity15 said			0
" but like each of them , i did n't get elected by telling my voters in @entity16 that i would follow the majority of my caucus even if i thought on some things they were wrong			0
we each have to do what we think is right			0
" political differences require compromise , even within the @entity91 caucus , @entity15 said			1
" in a group of 60 senators , achieving ideological uniformity is impossible because the country is too big and we represent too many people , " he said			0
before the meeting with @entity2 , liberal sens. @entity127 of @entity128 and @entity129 of @entity130 indicated that the @entity24 buy - in would likely be dropped			1
while they did n't like the idea , they suggested they would support a health care bill anyway			0
democrats " may have to do what mr. @entity15 wants , " @entity127 told @entity1			0
@entity15 supported letting older workers buy into @entity24 in 2000 , when he was the @entity91 vice presidential candidate , and as recently as september in comments to a @entity16 newspaper			1
now , he said both monday and tuesday , the country has huge deficits -- as opposed to a budget surplus nine years ago -- and @entity24 is poised to run out of money in 2017			0
the @entity24 buy - in was part of a package of provisions announced by senate majority leader @entity149 last week as an alternative to a public option , which lacked enough support among @entity3 to break a @entity44 filibuster			1
negotiated by a team of 10 @entity91 senators -- five liberal and five moderate -- the compromise package had been hailed by @entity149 , @entity2 and others as an important step forward in the health care debate			1
the package also would allow private insurers to offer nonprofit health coverage overseen by the government			0
but many senators have reserved judgment on the compromise proposal until the non-partisan @entity168 provides its analysis of how much it costs			0
the @entity168 estimate was expected to be completed as soon as tuesday			0
most democrats have supported the public option as a nonprofit competitor to private insurers that would expand coverage and bring down prices			0
republicans and some moderate @entity3 , along with the health insurance industry -- one of the major employers in @entity15 's home state -- oppose a public option , calling it a first step toward a government takeover of the @entity78 health care system			1
" i have n't received any pressure from the insurance companies , " @entity15 insisted tuesday			2
periodically , they 'll talk to my staff about one thing or another , but ... i 've never hesitated to take on the insurance companies			0
" another potential obstacle for @entity149 is moderate @entity195 @entity194 of @entity196 , who said sunday said he can not support the @entity3 bill without tighter restrictions on federal funding for abortion			1
the @entity3 last week defeated an amendment proposed by @entity194 and two other senators that would adopt tougher language on abortion funding contained in the @entity100 health care bill			1
a compromise on the abortion language is possible , said @entity194 , one of the 10 @entity3 who negotiated in private last week			0
if the @entity3 eventually passes a health care bill , its version will have to be merged with the version the @entity100 passed in november , which includes a public health insurance plan			2
the final bill would then need approval from both chambers before going to @entity2 to be signed into law			2
@entity2 and @entity91 leaders have said they want the bill completed this year			1
the @entity3 would need to finish its work this week to leave a realistic chance of meeting that schedule			0
@entity1 's @entity227 contributed to this report .			0
