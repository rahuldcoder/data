-- the @entity1 has reversed @entity3 ' two convictions on charges of rape as an accomplice and ordered a new trial , saying that instructions given to jurors were erroneous			1
@entity3 , the " prophet " of the @entity10 , or @entity10 , was sentenced to two consecutive terms of five years to life after he was convicted in september 2007			1
he was accused of using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14 - year - old girl into marrying her 19 - year - old cousin			0
" we regret the effect our opinion today may have on the victim of the underlying crime , to whom we do not wish to cause additional pain , " the court said			1
" however , we must ensure that the laws are applied evenly and appropriately , in this case as in every case			0
" in @entity3 ' trial , @entity28 testified that she repeatedly told him at the time that she did not want to be married and was uncomfortable with sexual advances from her husband , @entity31			1
she said @entity3 advised her to pray and submit to her husband , learn to love him and bear his children , or risk losing her " eternal salvation			1
" @entity28 was 21 at the time of @entity3 ' conviction in 2007			1
her attorneys made her name public at the end of the trial , with her consent			0
she is married to someone else and has left the @entity10			0
the first count of rape as an accomplice against @entity3 was alleged to have occurred shortly after @entity28 and @entity31 were married , when the two first had sex , the @entity1 opinion said			1
the second was alleged to have occurred after @entity3 refused to " release " @entity28 from her marriage and told her to " give herself to [ @entity52 ] ... mind , body and soul			1
" prosecutors relied on three separate portions of the law defining the circumstances under which sex is non-consensual , the opinion said			0
under those portions , the victim must express a lack of consent through words or conduct , the victim must be younger than 18 years , and " the actor " must be in a position of special trust in relation to the victim			0
" @entity3 argues that the instruction erroneously focused the jury on @entity3 ' actions and position of special trust , rather than on @entity31 's , for the purpose of determining whether @entity28 consented , " the opinion said			1
the justices agreed , saying the jurors should have been asked to consider whether @entity31 was in a position of special trust and whether @entity31 lured or induced @entity28 into having sex			0
" the state interprets the term ' actor ' to mean the ' defendant , ' " the opinion said			0
" we conclude that the state 's interpretation is erroneous			0
" " we 're thrilled , " said @entity3 ' defense attorney , @entity95			1
we 're ecstatic that the @entity1 agreed with us			0
... the state just had the wrong legal theory			0
" @entity3 is " an unpopular religious figure in our state , " @entity95 said , and the media have " had a field day portraying him as an evil , horrible , pernicious individual			1
" the court , he said , was able to put that aside and base its decision on the evidence and legal theories , not on emotion , and determine that the erroneous instructions led jurors to " an erroneous result			1
" the defense has always maintained that marrying someone , encouraging them to make their marriage work and " be fruitful and multiply ... that is not the same thing as saying to a husband , ' i 'm encouraging you to rape your wife , ' " @entity95 said			0
he said he had not had a chance to speak to @entity3 but planned to do so tuesday afternoon			2
assistant @entity127 attorney general @entity126 told @entity0 affiliate @entity129 that the opinion is " going to make it difficult , i think , for us to do future prosecutions in cases where some of these men in positions of power -- almost complete power , like @entity3 is -- to prosecute them for forcing young girls into these marriages			1
i think that 's really the part of this opinion that is most disappointing for us			0
" the justices sent the case back to the lower court for a new trial			1
the state has 14 days to request a rehearing with the @entity1 , said @entity151 , spokeswoman for @entity127 state courts			2
the justices would then grant or deny that petition			0
if a request is not made , the case will be sent back to the trial court within 30 days , and the lower @entity158 then has 30 days to schedule a hearing			1
@entity3 is being held at the @entity160 in @entity161 , about 30 miles south of @entity162			2
the issue of whether he should be released pending a new trial would be addressed at the @entity158 hearing , @entity151 said			0
however , @entity95 said , @entity3 will be transferred back to @entity166 in southern @entity127 , where he was convicted -- and closer to the @entity10 community			1
" we will be asking for bail , " he said			0
but @entity3 has a federal indictment against him for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution , said @entity173 , a spokeswoman for the @entity175 @entity174 in @entity127			1
the indictment states @entity3 traveled across state lines in 2006 to avoid prosecution			2
" there are federal detainers in place with the @entity160 and @entity166 , " @entity173 said			1
" although his attorney is saying he will ask for a bail hearing in the @entity127 state court , our federal detainers are in place			1
" @entity173 added if @entity3 is not held on state charges , authorities will bring him into federal custody			1
@entity95 said he expects @entity166 prosecutors to decide quickly whether they want to proceed with the case			0
@entity3 had been awaiting trial in @entity193 on four charges of being an accomplice to sexual conduct with a minor			2
but last month , a judge dismissed those charges			0
@entity200 , the @entity201 , @entity193 , prosecutor , had asked the court to throw out the charges , citing " much more serious charges " against @entity3 in @entity205 and the desire of his alleged victims that he " face these more serious charges as soon as possible			1
" @entity3 was indicted in @entity205 in 2008 on a felony charge of sexual assault of a child			2
an indictment accuses @entity3 of assaulting a child " younger than 17 years of age and not legally married to the defendant " in january 2005			2
if convicted on the @entity205 charges , @entity3 could face a maximum penalty of five to 99 years or life in prison and a fine of $ 10,000			2
the @entity10 drew national attention when @entity3 was arrested during a routine traffic stop in august 2006			2
at the time , he was on the @entity224 's @entity223			0
the sect is a 10,000 - member offshoot of the mainstream @entity228 church			0
its members openly practice polygamy at the @entity232 in @entity233 , @entity205 , and in two towns straddling the @entity127 - @entity193 state line : @entity236 , @entity127 , and @entity237 , @entity193			2
critics of the sect say young girls are forced into " spiritual " marriages with older men and are sexually abused			0
sect members have denied that any sexual abuse takes place			0
@entity3 had led the sect since his father 's death in 2002 .			2
