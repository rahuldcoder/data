-- ever since two men first laid a bet on two flies climbing up a cave wall , gambling has struck at the core of the human condition : the future is uncertain			1
and while games of chance like dice and cards have been with us for centuries , bar room wagers on matters of abstract speculation have often been lost to history , disappearing as fast as the hot air that produced them			1
until now , that is			2
novelty bets thanks to websites like @entity30 and professional gaming sites like @entity32 , oddball bets on everything from the next pope to the life expectancy of the universe have a running book			1
in the case of @entity30 , they are the source of heated debate about the shape of the future			1
" these bets become an interesting tool to understand how we think about the future and even if we are really arguing about the right things , " said @entity40 , director of the @entity41 , which backs the @entity42 bets project			1
betting exchanges that take novelty bets are nothing new -- @entity32 has a long - running book on whether it will snow on @entity52 and the next pope -- but what makes @entity42 bets different is that it will only accept bets that advance our understanding of science and the future			1
the winner also must donate their winnings to a charity of his choice			2
predicting the future so far , @entity63 has taken long - term bets on whether drones will do battle as part of protests , whether commercial flights will become pilotless and on the future of level of the world 's population			1
" people need to have an opposing argument and come to an agreement about the terms which actually turns out to be quite tricky , " @entity75 told @entity0			2
" someone will make a bet , for instance , that we will find extraterrestrial intelligence in the next 50 years , then there 's often a long philosophical discussion about what constitutes extraterrestrial intelligence or even life			1
" if we are talking about something as strange as that , we do n't know even if we 'd recognize it			0
" often , he said , the parties have already bashed out the terms before they come to @entity96			0
@entity98 's million dollar gamble in the case of its current highest profile bet -- a million dollar bet between billionaire investor @entity98 and alternative investment group @entity103 - the two parties had already agreed the terms and had come to @entity42 bets to find a platform for the wager			1
for a simple $ 50 fee , anyone can make a prediction , which then becomes a bet when someone takes up the challenge			0
nothing is too outlandish , said @entity75 , as long as it is well argued			1
often the results can be surprising			0
" we had one bet on the cost of energy five years into the future and the parties had used a very good source which was the report of the @entity126 @entity125 , " he said			1
however , when it came time to adjudicate that bet it was found the government had pulled its report in the wake of the $ 74 billion @entity134 scandal in 2001			0
" @entity134 had sufficiently skewed the energy market that the government had to unwind all the @entity134 trades out of its report to know the true cost of energy , " @entity75 said			0
" it was enough to flip the results of the bet			0
" changing parameters often the future is so unpredictable that the parameters of the debate change entirely			2
once such argument over whether the top 10 news stories would come from a blog or the @entity150 was , at the time , surprisingly eclipsed by @entity151 which was little known in 2002			0
" we often find that it 's not so much whether someone was right or wrong , but that what was being argued about was not even relevant , " @entity75 said			0
" our main goal is that they create an interesting discussion about the future			2
and we try to keep them away from celebrities and sports and more on arguments about the world			0
" we 've taken a few bets on sports but only when they 've been arguments about globalization			2
" some have time scales so long , that no one will ever collect on them			2
turing test a bet on whether the universe will keep expanding is unlikely ever to see a winner , but a $ 20,000 bet between @entity178 's director of engineering @entity180 and @entity182 founder @entity179 on artificial intelligence passing the turing test comes up in 2029			0
to pass the test , a machine or computer program must convince a human judge that it has a level of intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human being			0
for mainstream punters , meanwhile , betting exchanges like @entity32 have been taking novelty bets on everything from the next pope - more than Â £ 300,000 ( $ 450,000 ) was placed after pope @entity199 's resignation -- to parents betting on their sons becoming soccer @entity204 football captains			1
" for us it 's really a fraction of our business , less than 1 % , but it 's very good for our profile and we like doing it , " @entity32 told @entity0			1
" and anyway who knows ? one day we 'll all be caught with our pants down when @entity212 comes back into town			0
" read more from tomorrow transformed : @entity214 , the app that voiced @entity217 's protests the @entity218 from science fiction is coming finally , a flying car for everybody ?			0
