-- every morning at 7:30 , @entity1 trudges up sand - dusted steps , pries open a metal folding chair and joins a handful of his fellow retirees under a plastic tent , facing seaward			0
they are staging a protest			0
their sit - ins are in opposition to a perceived threat that many of his neighbors also fear : the planned expansion of a @entity20 military base on @entity22 's east - facing @entity21			2
last week , however , the routines of both @entity1 and the @entity20 military were upset			0
and even though the reason for that disruption -- a devastating earthquake and subsequent tsunami -- demonstrated the advantage of having @entity20 bases , @entity1 and others say they will not alter their efforts to get the @entity20 military off the island			1
in the wake of the earthquake , the @entity20 military is sending humanitarian aid and technical assistance to the hardest - hit areas of @entity39			1
many of these efforts are being launched from bases on @entity43 , where the @entity20 maintains a permanent military presence under a treaty the two countries signed after @entity47 staging areas in @entity22 allowed @entity20 assistance to reach the affected areas faster than aid from many other countries			1
perhaps more than at any time in recent memory , the @entity20 military has made a compelling case for its presence on @entity22			1
but to @entity1 , who said he views @entity20 troops as de facto occupiers , the benefits are outweighed			1
@entity59 , mayor of the city of @entity61 on @entity22 , pointed out saturday that he was elected on a platform of " no new construction of @entity20 facilities " on the island			2
he also recited a litany of statistics that many in @entity22 have committed to memory : seventy - five percent of all @entity20 bases in @entity39 are on @entity22 , an island that makes up less than 1 % of @entity39 's territory , and 20 % of the land on the island is taken by @entity20 bases			2
@entity59 said his constituents feel that the @entity39 central government requires a disproportionate " burden " of @entity78 , relative to residents of other parts of @entity39			1
he wants some of the @entity20 presence on his island to be relocated to another @entity39 island			1
still , not everyone in @entity22 is against the influence of the @entity20 , which provides economic and strategic benefits			1
in statistics from the @entity88 at @entity89 , @entity20 forces spend an annual $ 1.9 billion in the local economy , constituting as much as 10 % of @entity22 's @entity92			0
and according to @entity93 9 of @entity39 's @entity94 , " land , sea , and air forces , as well as other war potential , will never be maintained , " meaning that the @entity20 military presence represents @entity39 's strongest line of defense in the event of an attack			2
but @entity1 said he would not be deterred			0
" once the tsunami warnings are lifted , i will be back every day until mr. @entity105 cancels the current plans for the base expansion , " he said			0
asked why he , a @entity39 citizen , pinned his hopes on the @entity20 president , he said , " the @entity39 government will listen to whatever the @entity20 government tells them			0
the government of @entity39 does n't have its own policy			0
it 's a pitiful government			0

@entity20 aid efforts are being launched from bases on @entity43
many *okinawans* oppose the @entity20 presence there
the bases provide economic and strategic benefits
a mayor says his constituents feel a disproportionate burden
