-- president @entity1 is the first @entity2 leader in decades to visit @entity3 , the @entity4 nation grappling with the mystery of a vanished jetliner			1
@entity1 landed in @entity7 on saturday , seven weeks to the day @entity8 disappeared with 239 people aboard			1
he 's remained largely quiet over the issue amid an international underwater search focusing on the southern @entity12			1
at an elaborate dinner at @entity16 palace , attended by some 600 guests , @entity13 offered a toast in @entity19 and personally thanked @entity1 for @entity2 support in the aftermath of the plane 's disappearance			1
a day before his arrival , he told a @entity3 newspaper , @entity25 , that the @entity2 remains committed to the search			1
" the @entity2 was one of the first countries to join in the search for the missing plane , " he said			1
" @entity32 ships , aircraft and personnel remain on the scene , assisting in the search			0
our @entity37 is working closely with @entity3 on the investigation into what caused the aircraft to disappear			2
and we 'll continue to offer our support and assistance as the search and investigation continue			0
" @entity1 will discuss the search for the missing plane with @entity3 's prime minister , deputy national security adviser @entity46 told reporters , but it will not be the only item on the agenda			1
@entity3 is a growing partner of the @entity2 , which seeks to deepen that relationship , @entity46 said			1
topics of discussion between the two leaders will include trade , security and regional issues , he said			0
narrowed search nears end because of inclement weather , the planned air and sea search for sunday was suspended , the @entity63 said			1
the @entity68 - 21 search was expected to take place			0
@entity1 's visit comes as the initial search by the @entity72 nears its end			1
the submersible , which is on contract to the @entity32 , is scouring the ocean floor for traces of the plane			0
previously , another device , a " towed pinger locator " detected signals that officials believed were from its flight recorders , which determined the current search area for the @entity68			0
the underwater sonar device plunged into the @entity12 on saturday , kicking off its 14th mission			0
it has slowly scoured 95 % of the ocean floor that searchers had narrowed down for it			0
so far , it has found no trace of the missing jetliner			0
if the @entity68 - 21 searches 100 % of the area with nothing to show for it , the underwater search may expand @entity95 officials said			1
on saturday , the @entity101 ship @entity102 returned to port in @entity104 for replenishment after assisting in the search			0
a @entity32 source told @entity0 on friday that the current search area is expected to move slightly north if the @entity68 does n't find any wreckage			0
specifically , it might shift to encompass a 6 - mile radius around where another " ping " was detected			0
the underwater search so far has focused on a circle with a 10 - kilometer ( 6.2 - mile ) radius around the location of a detected " ping , " the @entity63 said			1
" we are currently consulting very closely with our international partners on the best way to continue the search into the future , " the @entity95 - based center coordinating the search said in a statement			2
the plane disappeared after leaving @entity7 , @entity3 , for @entity127			1
preliminary report @entity3 prime minister @entity129 has said a preliminary report on the plane 's disappearance will be available to the public next week			1
he also asked an internal investigation team to look into what other information may be released publicly next week , his office said			0
the report has been sent to the @entity138 , the @entity140 body for global aviation , but not yet made available to the public			2
the @entity140 organization said among the safety recommendations in the report is a suggestion by @entity3 that the aviation world needs to look at real - time tracking of commercial aircraft			2
it 's the same recommendation that was made after the @entity151 went down in the @entity152 in 2009			0
" anytime there is a tragedy like this we ought to also reflect on what can be done going forward to prevent something similar from happening again , " @entity1 said			2
" that discussion has begun in @entity3 and around the world , and we 'll see what improvements might be recommended to continue improving aviation security			2
one thing is already clear , however , is that large international efforts like this search operation benefit from existing partnerships among nations			0
" @entity1 , who will be in @entity3 until sunday , is the first @entity2 president to visit @entity7 in almost 50 years			1
he leaves for the @entity169 on sunday , where he will remain until his departure for the @entity2 on tuesday			2
@entity0 's @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 contributed to this report .			0
