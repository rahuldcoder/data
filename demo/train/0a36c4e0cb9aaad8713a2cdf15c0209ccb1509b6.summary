album sales are at an all - time low in the @entity1			2
vinyl sales are at their highest for 15 years			2
everybody says streaming is the future , yet major artists are pulling out of streaming services			1
and in tech - oriented @entity9 , cds still account for 85 % of album sales			2
the current state of the music industry is anyone 's guess			1
@entity15 technology is transforming the way music is created , shared and enjoyed , and where we will go from here is hard to predict			1
the latest shock to the system is @entity25 's decision to break up with @entity15 , the popular music streaming service that has 40 million active users -- one quarter of which are paying subscribers			1
with the release of her latest album , entitled " 1989 , " @entity25 -- arguably music 's most popular artist at the moment -- requested that all her back catalog be removed from the service			1
the move , which would be risky for most other artists , helped boost sales of the album to 1.3 million units in its debut week , the best performance in the industry since 2002			2
with no legal option other than buying , fans obliged			0
@entity15 says that over 70 % of its revenues go to artists , but just between $ 0.006 and $ 0.0084 is paid for each play , depending on the artist			1
others before @entity25 have pulled out : @entity53 famously described the service as " the last desperate fart of a dying corpse , " and his solo works are not available for streaming			1
other no - shows include @entity60 , who have an exclusive deal with @entity63			0
and yet , @entity15 is now earning some artists more money than @entity66 in @entity67 , as was revealed at the web summit technology conference in @entity69 by @entity70 , ceo and founder of @entity72 , a company that represents thousands of musicians			1
that means that streaming is becoming , in some instances , more profitable than album sales			1
predicting the hits elsewhere in the digital world , social media is becoming a dominant contributing factor to the popularity of an artist , and it 's also generating a huge amount of data that can be a powerful tool for trend analysis			1
public social data is like a crystal ball that can help the music industry predict who 's going to become the next big thing			1
a company called @entity93 specializes in precisely these types of predictions			1
by tracking streams and collecting data from the @entity101 -- new @entity98 followers , @entity96 likes and @entity103 page views -- the company says it can estimate the likelihood of an artist making it into the @entity107 , which charts album releases , over a year before it happens			1
making the charts is not easy			0
speaking at the web summit , @entity110 of @entity93 pointed out that in the last year , only 961 artists made the @entity107 , and just 204 of those were entering it for the first time			1
the @entity115 , which tracks singles rather than albums , is an even more exclusive club : out of 249 artists appearing , just 43 were debuting			0
despite the charts favoring established artists , it 's never been so easy to make , share and discover new music			1
" at the end of the 90s you needed a full blown musical studio to make real music , " said @entity124 , co-founder of streaming service @entity125 , " now all you need is a laptop			1
even an @entity133 can be enough			0
music making is for everyone			1
technology has made it cheaper , accessible and more powerful			0
" @entity125 was launched in 2007 and allows users to upload their music and embed it anywhere , offering a powerful tool for discovery			1
it has evolved significantly over the years , skewing its balance in favor of listeners and introducing algorithms that spot protected material			0
" we care a lot about copyrights and we have automatic filters that can block content on behalf of copyright holders , " said @entity124			0
" we want to go to a billion monthly listeners , and welcoming major labels is a key point of the journey there			0
" the service , which currently boasts 175 million monthly listeners , has just announced a licensing deal with @entity163 , and is introducing a paid subscription model next year			2
" if you have those numbers , naturally you want to generate revenue , and that 's what we 're focusing on at the moment , " said @entity124			0
a matter of taste even though music discovery has evolved rapidly in recent years , there is still no consensus on which technology is the best to analyze someone 's musical taste			2
according to @entity179 , who was among the founders of the @entity182 headphones brand , we might need to start from scratch			0
" even with all this music , at any given time i still only have about five to 10 songs that i love and listen to , but i have to believe there may be 100 that would really touch me in the same way , " he said			2
" i feel we need a new technology that can figure that out			0
" @entity179 now heads @entity192 , a rising brand of audio products , and thinks that in the future we 'll have headphones capable of analyzing a user 's emotional response to a song , and then suggesting something similar			2
" it takes three seconds for you to know whether you like a song or not			0
there 's something about our ears and our body and our mind that figures that out so quickly , and we need to find a technology that can do that for us , " he said			0
@entity63 bought beats earlier this year for $ 3 billion , in a strong statement about the significance of headphones in this industry : because we listen to so much music through our phones , hidden away in our pockets , it 's what 's on our heads that counts			2
but @entity179 thinks that headphones have become too ubiquitous			0
" i hope people will discover this thing called the speaker , " he said			0
" right now you need a large , expensive speaker to get good sound , but we had the same problem with headphones and we solved that			0
i 'm confident that we 'll manage to shrink speakers in size without compromising sound quality : when we figure that out , people will change the way they listen to music at home			2
" one thing , however , does seem likely : " streaming is the way of the future , " said @entity125 's @entity124			1
at the end of the web summit , sharing the stage with the final panelists , @entity243 's @entity242 joined the discussion , defending @entity15 's royalty model , and arguing that streaming is , indeed , what lies ahead , even amid the many uncertainties			1
" the remunerative bit still has to be figured out , " he said			0
" this is an experimental and exciting period			0
so , let 's experiment and see what works			0
" read more : never cook again -- now you can print your own pizza			0

the future of the digital music *business* is still uncertain
@entity25 recently pulled out of streaming service @entity15
