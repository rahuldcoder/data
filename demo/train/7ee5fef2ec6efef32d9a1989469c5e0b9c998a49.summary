-- it 's the dark days that @entity2 remembers most			1
the phone calls with his psychologist where the tears flowed , the moment his wife @entity3 sat him down and told him he could give up the game of golf , that he had nothing left to prove			1
he boasted an unenviable place in the record books : the most runner - up spots in @entity15 history without a win , having finished second nine times in 227 tournament starts			1
and then there was the accolade of being the only @entity22 representative -- he played for @entity23 at @entity24 in 2008 -- not to have won a title			2
however , in a career of unlucky numbers , the @entity26 will forever remember 228 -- which marked his long - awaited breakthrough victory and the lifting of a cloud of depression that threatened to end his playing days			2
it came this month at @entity36 , as the 34 - year - old held off the world 's best player , @entity38 , to win the prestigious @entity40 and rocket 636 places up the world rankings from 792nd			1
as he walked down the 18th fairway at the home of golf , running through his mind was the thought that he would soon be hearing from the legendary @entity49 , a nine - time major winner with a propensity to tweet each weekend 's big tournament winner			1
for the first time in @entity2 's life , he was the social media recipient			1
he calls it a " @entity59 " and it is just that			2
things started to go horribly wrong when he missed qualifying for the 2012 @entity15 by a single shot in @entity63			1
he returned to the locker room and burst into tears			1
" there were some very dark times , " he says on reflection			2
" last year was very rough on us ( @entity2 and his wife )			1
it was hard , very stressful at home			2
" @entity2 was shelling out money just to play golf			1
he estimates that , prior to @entity36 , he had spent about $ 120,000 over two years merely traveling to tournaments -- and banked barely half of that before tax from a smattering of prize money			2
he is not looking for sympathy -- after all , he admits he is unlucky enough to have banked enough money from past results to be financially secure			2
" i remember @entity3 said to me , ' it 's okay if you do n't want to do it and do n't enjoy it			2
' and i hated it			2
i did n't want to go and play , " he says			2
" i worked harder than ever before in practice and in the gym , and it only made it worse			0
in some ways being at events was easy			0
the pressure was off , i knew i 'd turn up , play two rounds , not make the cut and go home			2
" until @entity36 , where in 2009 he tied for second with @entity38 at the same event , @entity2 had not carded a single round under par in two months			1
perhaps a tad ironic for a golfer who had hit rock bottom , it was fellow @entity15 professional @entity107 that came to his aid			1
@entity107 sent a lengthy email missive detailing his compatriot 's swing , likening it to that of @entity38 and @entity113 , and highlighting where he had gone wrong with it			0
with the new tips on board , @entity2 put them into practice the following day and immediately broke the course record , albeit at a second - tier @entity122 event in @entity123			1
" i thought , ' we could be on to something here			0
' i owe it all to him , " @entity2 says			1
he was not able to follow up his success at last weekend 's rain - shortened @entity129 masters , where only two rounds were possible , but he has had time to reflect on the $ 800,000 pay check -- which took him past $ 8 million in career prize money -- and what it means for him			1
for one thing , he has secured his place on the @entity15 for the next two years , and entry into two @entity139 events			1
@entity2 had always said his aspiration was to buy an @entity141 when he won a tournament			1
now it has happened , he does not intend to be so frivolous			0
for him , the money is not the key thing			0
" i 'd always dreamed of winning at @entity36 -- the ( @entity147 ) @entity146 or the @entity148 -- but this time it happened			0
" it will go down as one of the most popular victories of the season , all and sundry tweeting and texting to pass on their congratulations to one of the sporting feelgood stories of 2014			0
@entity38 -- the man he pipped to the title -- was among those to congratulate @entity2 , as well as @entity161 star @entity160 , who tweeted : " i ca n't tell you how happy every player on @entity15 will be for @entity2 winning the @entity148			1
it 's been a long road back			0
" aptly , the tournament ended in him driving away from @entity36 in a @entity167 while the world 's golfing elite took off in their private jets			1
but now he says he feels he can " take on the world " -- a far cry to the past two seasons when he needed a psychologist to " keep me going while i was breaking down over the phone			1
i did n't know what to do			0
" that he was at @entity36 at all was somewhat fortuitous -- @entity2 needed a late invite from the organizers			1
" i was nervous on the saturday but not on the sunday until the final two holes , " he recalls			0
" the big thing was making a four on the 17th , i 'd avoided the big danger			0
i remember hitting the three wood on the 18th and i just did n't have any feeling of how it was , like you normally would			0
" it was the same with the approach , there was just no feedback -- it was bizarre			0
i thought i was set for another playoff ( he has lost all four he has been in ) but @entity194 's putt slid just wide and that was it			0
" unbeknown to him , his wife had traveled to @entity198 to watch his final round , and @entity2 only spotted her as he left the final green			1
" i 'm glad i did n't know she was there until then , " he says			0
" i remember i was looking at the ground as i was crying but then i looked up and she appeared			0
that was amazing , to know she 'd had that belief in me to come up there			0
" i think a lot of people think golfing wives are trophy wives but we 're a team and she 's been through it all			2
she 's been a massive influence			0
" @entity2 's golfing roller coaster is finally back on the upswing			1
at his previous peak six years ago he was a member of the last @entity23 team to lose the @entity22 , but he did not foresee how his fortunes would plummet			0
" i felt incredible , like anything could happen , " he says of that time			0
" i saw other players struggle and i thought , ' that wo n't happen to me			0
' " but then it did and he feared he would never get his game back			0
however , he is now targeting a place in the @entity15 's top 30 and the hope of playing at his first major tournament since 2010			1
after all , next year the @entity146 will be held at his new lucky course -- @entity36 .			0

@entity2 wins his first @entity15 tournament at the 228th attempt
golfer had considered walking away from the sport after a dismal run of form
he admitted being in tears after rounds of golf as his past form completely vanished
now he is $ 800,000 *richer* and feels he can take on the golfing world in 2015
