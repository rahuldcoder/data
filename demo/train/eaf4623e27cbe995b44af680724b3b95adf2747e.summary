-- they do n't call it " @entity4 " for nothing			0
@entity6 , for example , thought she had lost her mind the first time she read " @entity9			1
" partly because she 's 36			2
" i was absolutely worried that something was wrong with me , " the @entity11 mother of two said			0
" i just could n't put it down -- i was obsessed completely			0
" she picked up the first of @entity16 's vampire novels -- recommended by a teen neighbor -- with few expectations			1
after devouring it , she could n't get the images of doomed love between a vegetarian vampire , @entity23 , and an awkward teenage girl , @entity24 , off her mind			2
@entity6 thought about the books so much she seriously wondered if she was experiencing some sort of midlife crisis			0
" i thought i was the only woman in the world who was my age and was just obsessed with books , " she said			0
in reality , far from it			0
@entity6 is just one of the thousands of women around the world who have gotten caught up in the vampire frenzy			2
while they resemble the youthful , squealing " twilight " fans on occasion -- @entity40 , who plays vampire @entity41 in the films , admitted some of the mail he gets from older fans makes him blush -- they 're still not the typical fan girls			1
for starters , being so in love with " twilight " when you 're " of a certain age " can come with a healthy dose of shame			2
" the stigma of it being a teenager 's book was the biggest issue , " @entity6 said			2
" everyone felt the same way i did , like , ' what 's wrong with me ? why am i obsessing over this teenager thing ? ' " but , one by one , the women began to find each other online , relieved that they were n't the only ones			1
" as grown women we know that we never forget our first love , the first time our heart was really broken , " @entity6 explained of the often indescribable pull of @entity16 's work			1
" i just think that so many women can kind of identify with the experiences and emotions and underlying message of how difficult it is to make choices in life			2
" since so many of " @entity9 " fan sites were overrun with teenagers , adult women have erected their own digital havens for fans who could take only so much of the " @entity23 's so hot ! ! ! " reaction to " @entity9			1
" there 's @entity6 's @entity86 web site , which she started for married women and mothers who want to revel in their " @entity9 " fandom , and sites like 49 - year - old @entity91 's , which is for any adult " twilight " fan , parent or not			1
both of them say they get steady streams of messages from women thanking them for helping them come out of their " @entity9 " closet			1
" many of us [ fans ] are happily married with kids , some as old as the male leads in ' twilight			2
' some of them jokingly refer to themselves as ' cougars ' because of this , but it 's used as a humorous way of saying we realize we are old enough to be @entity114 's mother [ and ] we still find him attractive , " @entity91 said			2
the cougar comes out of the closet historically , any woman nearing menopause was expected to be at home , raising kids and uninterested in sex , said @entity122 , who claims credit for the concept of the " cougar			2
" " i wrote a book about older women and younger men in 1990 , and let me tell you , the world was not ready for older women having sex with younger men , " @entity126 said			1
" older women have always been indoctrinated to believe that they would get to a certain age and they were no longer wanted and sexy and desired			1
i think older women who have found their sexuality have always lusted after younger men but they were never , never allowed to say so			1
" she hopes the love and lust many of these women display for the " @entity9 " characters and the much younger actors who play them will turn the stereotype on its head			1
" we 've got a whole new social phenomenon of older women saying , ' who told me sexuality would die ? it has n't ! here it is still burning away , maybe not for the guy i 've been with for 30 years , but it 's still there , ' " @entity126 said			1
" they 're embracing it now			0
" indeed , the " twilight " fans are very aware of the age gap between themselves and the objects of their oft - sexy fantasies , and , when given the space to express it , they are n't the least bit ashamed			1
@entity162 , a 32 - year - old financial administrator who runs an adults - only " @entity9 " blog mature enough to make her shy away from providing a last name , said women have thanked her for being so openly crass about her love of " @entity9 " because it frees them to express desires in a way they would n't in real life			1
" we love to talk about how sexy @entity114 is and what we would do if we got close , " she said			0
" we feed off each other -- we can be these racy , silly , just kind of goofy women about this			0
no one 's being judged for being married and saying , ' i 'm 54 and i think this 23 - year - old is absolutely delicious			0
' " @entity162 , who runs the " @entity180 " site from @entity179 with her 41 - year - old friend @entity181 , said the books and movies have given her a new creative outlet			0
" i get excited over things that i never have before , " @entity162 said			0
" i 've never followed celebrities before and all of a sudden i 'm talking about @entity187 online and @entity189 , and my boyfriend is like , ' you do n't even watch tv			0
' " if @entity114 is on , she does now -- and her boyfriend does n't mind			0
neither does @entity181 's husband			0
these women , for the most part , are n't desperately single and looking for love through a fictional book about teens , @entity181 said			1
" i would n't go back to dealing with teenage love in a million years			0
i 'm happily married and i have a great relationship , so it 's not that i feel that ' @entity9 ' is filling a void , " @entity181 added			1
" the appeal is that it 's very simple and pure and it outlines this love story of someone who 's average and normal with this stellar , amazing person who has eyes for no one but her and could save her from anything			1
" fans camp out for " @entity214 " @entity215 do @entity216 it 's the fantasy romance of @entity23 and @entity24 -- which all of the women acknowledge could never actually happen , a sign of maturity younger fans do n't often express -- that inspires them to put some intensity back into their real - life relationships			1
" it 's helped relationships , because [ the fans ] are happier nowadays			1
they have more friends , even if it 's just online friends , [ and ] they 're racier now			0
we hear all the time that people 's sex lives have n't been the same since , " @entity181 said			1
oddly enough , there 's no sex in @entity16 's novels , at least nothing that could n't be replicated in the @entity239 movies they 're based on			1
that has n't stopped the fans from creating their own sex scenes in copious amounts of fan fiction , some of which have themes like " @entity23 and @entity24 do steamy office affair , " or " @entity23 and @entity24 try out s&m			1
" " it 's a rekindling of old feelings , because when you 're married and you 've got kids and you 're running around to the soccer and basketball and football games , [ and you 've got ] work , bills ... the relationship gets pushed off to the side , " explained @entity91 , herself a mother of two teenagers			0
" your husband may not look exactly like @entity23 , but just as men have their fantasies , women do too and they need to be able to express it , " she added			1
" a book like ' @entity9 ' has brought that out			2
" @entity86 , by contrast , aims to keep things family - friendly			0
@entity6 said she wanted the site to be something a woman can browse while in the presence of her kids			0
nevertheless , @entity6 acknowledges that even the more subdued older " @entity9 " fans admit feeling attracted			1
" @entity23 is just in a 17 - year - old body , but he 's actually 108 , " @entity6 said with a laugh			0
" i have a friend who said she 's able to justify her love for @entity286 because she counts his age in dog years			2
" but when the actors are under 18 , like @entity292 , the 17 - year - old who plays @entity286 , is , all of the women agree that a line has to be drawn on the swooning			0
" we 're very careful about that , because even to me that would feel creepy , " @entity6 said			0
" and then we have the mothers who say , ' oh my gosh he 's the same age as my son ! ' " but , the fans said , no one 's actually expecting to date @entity292 , @entity114 or @entity40			2
in the end , the obsession with " twilight " is all in the name of a good time between mothers and daughters , or new friends			0
" we 're having a really , really fabulous time being 30 , 40 , or 50			0
we 're very unapologetic of our age , " @entity162 said			0
" women are saying ' so what , i 'm 45 , i 'm married , i have children , but there 's no reason why i ca n't say that @entity114 is hot			2

adult *female* fans of the " @entity9 " series are just as in love with it as teen girls
they often take it a step further , *spicing* up @entity16 's chaste sex scenes
they created *communities* where they can express their " @entity9 " love without judgment
their " coming out " *reflects* a societal push toward older women embracing sexuality
