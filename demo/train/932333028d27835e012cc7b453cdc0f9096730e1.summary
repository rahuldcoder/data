@entity0 -- a lawsuit alleging that civilian @entity5 interrogators subjected @entity6 to torture and severe mistreatment at the notorious @entity9 in @entity10 can move forward , a federal judge ruled thursday			1
detainees leave @entity9 -- also known as @entity9 -- in 2006			2
@entity5 district court judge @entity12 rejected claims by defense contractor @entity14 that the company was immune from accountability over claims of physical abuse , war crimes and civil conspiracy			1
reports of torture and humiliation by soldiers and civilian contractors against @entity6 detainees created a political , diplomatic and public relations nightmare for the @entity29 administration in the months and years after the 2003 @entity6 invasion			1
four @entity6 detainees have sued in @entity5 federal courts , alleging contract interrogators assigned to the @entity9 -- known as @entity9 -- subjected them to beatings and mental abuse , then destroyed documents and video evidence and later misled officials about what was happening inside the facility			1
eleven @entity5 soldiers who also worked at the prison were court - martialed under the @entity44 for prisoner abuse , and several implicated company workers in similar crimes			2
no contractors have yet faced criminal charges in the wake of the scandal , however			1
@entity52 , @entity53 - based @entity14 said it was merely providing contracting services the government required , and that sensitive political and policy questions could not be brought up in any civilian trial			1
" while it is true that the events at @entity9 pose an embarrassment to this country , it is the misconduct alleged and not the litigation surrounding that misconduct that creates the embarrassment , " @entity12 wrote			0
" this court finds that the only potential for embarrassment would be if the court declined to hear these claims on political questions grounds			0
consequently , the court holds that plaintiffs ' claims pose no political question and are therefore justiciable			0
" the four @entity9 detainees , led by @entity80 , were released between 2004 and 2008 , and were never charged with a crime , said their attorneys			0
they were represented in their civil suit by the @entity84 and other individual lawyers			0
other @entity6 civilian lawsuits are pending			2
" private military contractors like @entity14 can not act with impunity , " said the center 's @entity87			1
" they must act within the bounds of law and must be held accountable for their participation in the atrocities at @entity9 and the other facilities in @entity6			2
we believe their actions and the acts of torture of their employees clearly violated the @entity104 , the @entity105 and the laws of the @entity5			0
" the case is @entity80 v. @entity108 , 1:08cv827			0
there is no word on when the case might go to trial ; it could also be settled out of court .			0
