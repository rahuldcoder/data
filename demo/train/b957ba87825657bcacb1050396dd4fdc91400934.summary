-- @entity2 prosecutor @entity1 juggled two roles on wednesday : overseeing the presentation of evidence in the @entity7 case to a grand jury and responding to the flurry of attacks and calls for his recusal from the case			1
@entity1 went on the offensive after @entity15 gov. @entity14 tried to deflect calls for the prosecutor 's ouster by saying it was up to @entity1 to recuse himself			1
@entity1 's deep ties with local police and perceived favoritism of law enforcement in criminal cases have led to concerns about his ability to be impartial in the @entity7 case			1
should he recuse ? in a statement sent to the media on tuesday night , @entity14 said , " from the outset , i have been clear about the need to have a vigorous prosecution of this case , and that includes minimizing any potential legal uncertainty			2
" " i am not asking @entity2 prosecutor @entity36 to recuse himself from this case			1
there is a well - established process by which a prosecutor can recuse themselves from a pending investigation , and a special prosecutor be appointed			2
departing from this established process could unnecessarily inject legal uncertainty into this matter and potentially jeopardize the prosecution , " @entity14 said			0
@entity1 's response : @entity14 needs to " man up			2
" " it 's the typical @entity14 doublespeak , " @entity1 said during a radio interview with the @entity49 on @entity50			2
" he says nothing and he 's ducking			2
" @entity1 said the state of emergency @entity14 declared on saturday gave the governor authority to remove @entity1 from the case			1
@entity1 said @entity14 should " just make a decision			0
" " he does n't need a reason , " @entity1 said to @entity50 , " all he has to do is a simple yes he 's out , or no he 's not out , and let 's move on			2
the @entity7 family deserves that and the rest of the community deserves it			1
" @entity1 firmly stated he is not removing himself from the case			0
" i have absolutely no intention of walking away from the duties and responsibilities entrusted to me by the people of this community			0
i 've done it for 24 years , " he said			0
the clock is ticking for a decision , according to @entity1			0
now that the presentation has begun , recusing the main prosecutor could complicate matters even more			1
" the most devastating thing that could happen , is if a week from now , a month from now he ( @entity14 ) decides that he 's taking me off this case and everybody is starting over			1
stand up , man up , " said @entity1 , " this family deserves nothing less than that			0
" 5 things to know about @entity7 's shooting grand jury presentation wednesday marked the first day of evidence presentation to the grand jury , a process that will likely continue into the fall			1
" we will be presenting absolutely everything to this grand jury , " @entity1 said on @entity50			1
" every statement that a witness made , every witness , every photograph , every piece of physical evidence			0
absolutely nothing will be left out , so the grand jury is making their decision based upon absolutely everything and we 'll go from there			1
" but not all the evidence is ready to be presented , according to @entity1 , which is why prosecutors will have to present in parts			0
" as things are completed they 'll be presented to the grand jury , " said @entity1 during an interview with @entity0 affiliate @entity109			1
" but we want to get the process started , and not wait until absolutely everything is done before we even start it			0
" overwhelming volume of evidence the evidence in the shooting death of @entity7 involves investigations from multiple agencies , including the @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and the @entity124			1
asked how many witnesses have been interviewed so far , @entity1 told @entity109 , " i do n't know			0
dozens and dozens , maybe hundreds			0
" he said the @entity122 has been successful at locating witnesses in the @entity128 apartments , near where @entity7 was killed			2
" the federal government is doing their independent investigation , and so they 're also talking to witnesses , and ultimately that will be made available to us , " @entity1 told @entity109			0
" they 're doing their own forensic testing			0
they 've done their own or will do their own post-mortem examination , and those results will be provided , all to the grand jury			1
" grand jury time line @entity1 estimated prosecutors will finish presenting the case by mid-october , a time line that brings its own set of challenges with the grand jury calendar , because the current session ends in early september			1
" we will be presenting what we can , between now and the end of their term , which is early september , " @entity1 told @entity50 , " after that , their term is extended just for this case and that 's all they will be doing			2
they can meet for as long as they want , as long as they want to meet			0
" " we present the full case to the grand jury and should there be an indictment , the full case will be presented to the trial jury so that they make the decision , " @entity1 said			1
" i do n't decide if somebody is guilty or not guilty			0
i present the evidence to a jury and the jury makes that decision			2
