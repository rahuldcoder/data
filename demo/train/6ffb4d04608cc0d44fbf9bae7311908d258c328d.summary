@entity0 -- prosecutors dropped charges wednesday against one of two men arrested in connection with an attack over the weekend on an @entity9 driver who was swarmed by bikers on a @entity0 street			1
" we are taking sunday 's crimes extremely seriously , and will proceed with charges in a manner that enables us to build the strongest cases possible , " said @entity12 , the prosecutor who is overseeing the case			2
charges against motorcyclist @entity19 were dropped			2
the 42 - year - old biker had originally faced charges of reckless endangerment , criminal mischief and menacing , the @entity20 said			1
but that did n't mean the prosecutors were done			0
" prematurely charging individuals with low - level crimes does not further the goals of the investigation , and could weaken the cases we expect to bring against the perpetrators of serious crimes , " said @entity27 said in a statement			0
" after we investigate the facts and each person 's individual actions , we will know what charges can be supported by the evidence			2
there is still a tremendous amount of investigation to be done			0
" the @entity20 released images and asked for the public 's help in identifying and locating suspects wanted in connection with the attack			1
the incident has drawn attention because much of it was captured in a video that shows @entity19 just before the alleged assault			2
@entity19 is one of the bikers seen pounding on the windows of a @entity59 after it was forced to stop in traffic following a chase by bikers -- an account confirmed by a police official			1
@entity19 may have been trying to protect the driver of the suv who had come under attack , according to one witness , a law enforcement official said			1
if so , that may not be obvious in the video , which appears to have been shot by a biker , because it ends before the driver of the suv is dragged from the vehicle , which also held his wife and 2 - year - old daughter			1
@entity19 , who surrendered to police , is cooperating with authorities , the @entity80 district attorney 's office said			1
police have said the @entity9 driver , identified by a source with knowledge of the incident as businessman @entity88 , initially called 911 on sunday afternoon to report that bikers were driving erratically on the @entity90			1
police say @entity88 sped off after allegedly accidentally hitting one biker , @entity92 , who had moved in front of his suv and then slowed			1
@entity92 , 28 , was in court wednesday facing misdemeanor charges , including reckless driving			0
@entity92 's attorney told reporters that his client is not guilty			2
@entity92 was to be released after posting $ 1,500 cash bail and a $ 15,000 insurance bond			0
in addition , his license was suspended and he was ordered to surrender his passport			0
" his motorcycle was struck and he stood right there			0
he never assaulted this man , he never tried to assault him in any way , and he does not know any of the other motorcyclists who were involved in this beating , " attorney @entity107 told reporters			0
@entity114 witnessed a part of the confrontation between the motorcyclists and the driver , who he described as a " maniac			1
" " if something happens , you stop right there			2
you do n't keep reacting on , " he told @entity1 's @entity125			2
investigators say @entity88 told them he feared for his life when bikers surrounded his vehicle , pounding on it and slashing his tires			1
he stepped on the gas and hit three more bikers , injuring one of them -- @entity88 -- critically			1
" all of his ribs are fractured , " @entity88 ' mother , @entity136 , told @entity137 , " his lungs are so badly bruised that he 's still on a ventilator			0
" @entity143 ' wife said he had been trying to help the first biker who was initially hit by the @entity9 when he , too , was hit			1
his family has said he is paralyzed and in a coma			0
police said the biker group , called " @entity88 , " chased the driver , whose flat tires forced him to stop			1
cornered , @entity88 was beaten , police said			0
he was treated at a hospital for slashes to his face and released			0
