-- rescue crews continued their frantic search sunday at a @entity4 military outpost near the @entity6 border where a massive avalanche buried up to 139 people , most of them @entity10 soldiers			1
a blanket of rock and snow covering one square kilometer -- about the size of a large city block -- slid over the base on the @entity18 early saturday morning , entombing it under 70 feet of snow			1
the @entity18 , known as the world 's highest battleground , is 6,300 meters ( 20,670 feet ) high and spans 77 kilometers ( 47 miles ) across the @entity23 that separates @entity6 - and @entity10 - controlled @entity24			1
a press release sunday from the @entity10 military indicated that 139 people were believed trapped in the avalanche -- a figure that is slightly higher than previously reported			1
none of the searches thus far has led to the discovery of any survivors , and poor weather has hampered such efforts			2
" it 's a very massive scale slide , " maj. gen. @entity35 said saturday			2
" they are under the slide , but we have n't lost hope			2
the rescue work is on , and we are keeping our fingers crossed			0
" crews flew in heavy machinery from neighboring @entity45			0
sniffer dogs and troops using bulldozers worked the ground			0
@entity35 said the military had not been able to establish contact with anyone inside the base since the avalanche			2

he said the army " has always risen to the occasion and will come through this challenge as well			0
" it was the first such disaster at the mountain headquarters in its two decades of existence , the military said			0
@entity6 , too , maintains a base on its side of the glacier in the disputed @entity24 region			1
@entity24 has been a source of bitter dispute between @entity6 and @entity10 since their independence in 1947			1
under terms that the two countries agreed to at the time , @entity24 's rulers could either opt to merge with @entity6 or @entity10 or remain independent			1
one part sided with @entity10			1
the ruler of the other part sided with @entity6 , where most people are @entity82			2
that caused controversy among the region 's @entity86 majority			0
many of them wanted to align with @entity10 , where @entity90 is the dominant religion			2
since then , the @entity24 issue has been the leading cause of conflict and two of three wars between the two countries			2
the @entity23 was formally established in 1972			0
but there have been routine accusations that both sides fire across the line -- accusations both have denied			0
in 1984 , @entity6 occupied key portions of the glacier			1
three years later , the two sides fought bitterly over @entity18			0
both maintain year - round military camps on their sides of the disputed mountainous region			0
in february , two avalanches swept over military camps in the @entity6 - controlled side of @entity24 , killing at least 11 soldiers			1
the avalanches hit two army camps in the health resort of @entity113 and at @entity114 , a town close to the @entity23			0
in january , another avalanche hit a joint patrol of the @entity6 army and border security forces in the @entity121 area , killing seven			1
winter in @entity24 this season is harsher than previous years , with several snowfalls and sharp dips in temperatures			0
