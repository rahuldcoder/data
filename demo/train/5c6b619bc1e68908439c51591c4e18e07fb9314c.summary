@entity1 president @entity0 has signed into law a bill that toughens penalties against gay people and defines some homosexual acts as crimes punishable by life in prison			1
homosexual acts are already illegal in @entity1 , and @entity0 had gone back and forth recently about whether he would sign the controversial bill in the face of vocal opposition from the @entity14			1
at the public signing of the bill monday , a defiant @entity0 declared that he would not allow the @entity14 to impose its values on @entity1			1
" we have been disappointed for a long time by the conduct of the @entity14 , the way you conduct yourselves there , " he told @entity19 's @entity18 in @entity20			1
" our disappointment is now exacerbated because we are sorry to see that you live the way you live , but we keep quiet about it			0
now you say ' you must also live like us ' -- that 's where we say no. " the bill , introduced first in 2009 , originally included a death penalty clause for some homosexual acts			1
it was briefly shelved when @entity34 and other @entity36 nations threatened to withdraw aid to @entity1 , which relies on millions of dollars from the international community			1
the nation 's parliament passed the bill in december , replacing the death penalty provision with a proposal of life in prison for " aggravated homosexuality			1
" this includes acts in which one person is infected with @entity50 , " serial offenders " and sex with minors , according to @entity54			0
the bill also proposed years in prison for anyone who counsels or reaches out to gays and lesbians , a provision that would ensnare rights groups and others providing services to lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people			1
@entity0 's position on the law changed several times since lawmakers passed it late last year			2
in january he said he would n't sign the bill , describing homosexuals as " sick " people who needed help , not imprisonment			0
but he backtracked this month and said he 'd sign it because scientists had determined that there is no gene for homosexuality and that it is merely a choice to embrace abnormal behavior			0
" it was learned and could be unlearned , " @entity0 said			2
shortly after his announcement , @entity85 president @entity84 warned that enacting the bill would affect relations between the two nations			1
he described the proposal as an " affront and a danger to the gay community " in @entity1			2
the @entity85 is among the nation 's largest donors			2
on monday , @entity0 rejected the suggestion that the new laws were a step back for @entity1 and said he was n't concerned about the @entity14 's perception of his country			1
" worried ? not at all , " he told @entity19			0
" if the @entity14 does n't want to work with us because of homosexuals , then we have enough space here to live by ourselves and do business with other people			2
" " we see how you do things , the families , how they 're organized			0
all the things , we see them , we keep quiet , " he said			0
" it 's not our country , maybe you like it			0
so there 's now an attempt at social imperialism -- to impose social values of one group on our society			0
" homosexuality in @entity121 homosexuality is illegal in 38 @entity121 countries , where most sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism			0
in @entity1 , homosexual acts were punishable by 14 years to life in prison even before the controversial bill was signed into law			1
lawmakers in the conservative nation sought tougher legislation , saying the influence of @entity136 lifestyles risked destroying family units			0
rights groups worldwide have condemned the bill as draconian .			0
