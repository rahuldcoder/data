what if war is triggered by accident or some kind of miscalculation on the @entity5 ? this is a possibility that has provoked worry , analysis and preparations for more than 50 years			1
the recent bellicose rhetoric from the young , unproven leader of @entity13 raises this possibility to a new height			1
what precisely is the risk , and what should be done about it ? the angry rhetoric of @entity21 has set a record for extremism			0
and yet , going all the way back to the negotiating tactics used in the @entity26 , the @entity13 has used an extreme , abusive and contradictory style			1
anything conceded to them was taken , but they conceded nothing			0
anything up for negotiation was met with ever heightening demands			0
every offer of compromise was met with an angry rhetoric of denial			0
repeated rounds or negotiations over the succeeding decades have seen little change			0
and their public rhetoric has always been harsh and hyperbolic			0
opinion : @entity13 is far from suicidal but it has n't been only rhetoric over the years			1
in the 1960s , @entity49 soldiers serving in @entity13 were authorized to wear their division 's insignia on the right shoulder , the so - called combat patch			1
a @entity55 ship was attacked , boarded and seized with its crew held captive in 1968			0
a @entity58 major and another soldier were beaten to death in the @entity61 in 1976			0
again and again , @entity13 has defied international accords , laws and common sense , creating and exporting long - range missiles , building nuclear capabilities and engaging in kidnappings , sabotage and cyberattack			2
but there has been no war			0
we attribute this to three factors			0
first , we believe the overwhelming power of the @entity49 guarantees that any @entity13 attack would , eventually , result in the utter destruction of the regime			1
second , the @entity80 leadership has shown remarkable restraint in the face of humiliating @entity13 provocations			1
third , the @entity13 may not have ever intended to attack , though we have no way of knowing , or they understand that the combined @entity49 - @entity80 forces would destroy @entity13 should war begin			1
the @entity49 and @entity80 deterrent remains strong -- in both rhetoric and deployable , effective military power			1
but what about miscalculation ? yes , it is always possible that @entity21 may doubt that the @entity49 would act , despite all the evidence to the contrary			1
or , perhaps he miscalculates how far he can push the @entity80			2
it is possible that a @entity98 provocation could be so extreme that the @entity80 would be compelled by its own domestic politics to respond militarily -- say a tit - for - tat ship - sinking			1
or maybe such an incident occurs by accident , if overzealous commanders make a wrong move			0
opinion : does @entity13 think @entity49 going soft ? and then @entity21 , fearing that his own associates would mistake forbearance for weakness , would escalate in turn , thus initiating a cycle of intensifying moves that could spread conflict and turn into a war that neither side could back away from			1
the risk is higher now than before because @entity21 's bellicose rhetoric may mask real weaknesses in his authority or in his understanding			1
the rising rhetoric raises tensions ( as it is probably designed to do )			2
these tensions increase the risks of fear or pride , which could lead to an inadvertent incident			0
should an incident occur , there will be pressure on leaders of both sides to retaliate and even escalate hostility			0
the consequences of conflict are higher than before , given the @entity98 's nuclear and missile capabilities			0
what should be done ? first , ensure that the @entity49 deterrent is capable and credible			1
this requires that we have the capability to both defend ourselves and strike back , and that we make it as clear as possible to the @entity13 our resolve to use these capabilities if challenged			2
second , assure our @entity80 allies that we will stand with them , so they can afford politically to be restrained			2
third , strike a balance between demonstrating resolve in public and , simultaneously , working to reduce tensions			0
@entity13 must always be given an " out " from the box of escalating threats it has constructed , but the out must not involve @entity49 - @entity80 concessions , apologies or any signs of hesitancy , weakness or lack of resolve			1
this requires artful balancing of military demonstrations , deployments , statements and behind - the - scenes dialogue with @entity170 and others in the region			0
opinion : @entity21 is not crazy the odds are that there will be no conflict			0
the @entity49 and @entity80 leadership is experienced			1
and so are those behind the young leader in the @entity13			2
this is a familiar game , but one whose risks far outweigh any actual benefits to the @entity13			2
why is the world fascinated by @entity13 ?			2

@entity187 : what if war is triggered by accident or some kind of miscalculation ?
@entity187 : the recent bellicose rhetoric from @entity13 raises the possibility
however , @entity13 has a *history* of using extreme words to scare *opponents*
@entity187 : the @entity49 and @entity80 deterrent remains strong ; odds are there wo n't be war
