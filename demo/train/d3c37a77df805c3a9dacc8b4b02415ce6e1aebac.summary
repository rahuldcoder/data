@entity0 prepares to dissolve itself , and its replacement starts working towards @entity7 's new constitution and democratic institutions , it is worth reflecting why the @entity8 and @entity9 supported the revolution back in late march			1
contrary to what some believe , it was not all about oil ; but oil and gas will be central to @entity7 's recovery			1
there is no doubt that if the @entity21 had not been imposed and the decision to back regime change was not taken , then colonel @entity20 would have carried out his threat to punish @entity25 for its february 17 uprising , at enormous human cost			0
but even if prime minister @entity28 and president @entity29 were motivated by humanitarian concerns -- and encouraged by the feasibility of protecting an enclave that had bravely won freedom for itself -- could they nevertheless be expecting a bounty in return for their support ? there has been a lot of disinformation and muddled thinking on this question , starting with the letter purportedly written by the rebels in early april promising to assign @entity9 35 % of the country 's oil in return for its support			1
the @entity3 has denied making such a commitment , but even if it had , would any new and legitimate government of @entity7 need to honor it ? what , indeed , does @entity7 's oil wealth amount to and how should the new government manage it ? the answers to these questions show just how impossible it will be for the rulers of the new @entity7 state to hand out portions of its reserves and production to its friends , or for @entity8 , @entity9 and even @entity63 , which has huge political influence and vast interests in @entity7 's oil and gas sector , to expect many favors			1
@entity7 's past oil production of about 1.6 million barrels per day was sold on contracts arranged by the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) 's opaque oil marketing committee			1
there is a lot which the new management can do to make this process more transparent and open and also to account for revenues more fully			0
it is in the country 's interests to ensure the process is competitive			0
any future scramble for new @entity7 hydrocarbons reserves will also be competitive			1
existing reserves are of course spoken for			0
all of @entity7 's production belongs either to subsidiaries of @entity71 or to approximately half a dozen joint ventures with @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity91 companies			1
dozens of other companies including @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 have exploration rights to large areas of @entity7 's desert and sea , but so far not many of them have made discoveries			1
these rights are tied up in contracts most of which give a very good deal to the @entity7 side			1
initially the @entity3 said it would honor all these contracts unless there was clear evidence of corruption			2
it has shifted this position somewhat in response to popular pressure			0
the interim oil and finance minister @entity115 recently announce the formation of a committee which will examine every contract			2
but changes at this level are unlikely			0
many of the recent contracts were awarded in highly - competitive open licensing rounds in which the scope for corruption was very limited			2
the older contracts could be more doubtful , but these are the producing contracts -- the country 's life blood			2
the government may make the bold move of publishing them , but can not cancel them without huge cost			0
if anything is up for grabs in the @entity7 of the future , it could be service contracts to help the state oil company improve production from its existing fields and further exploration rights for gas			1
in the two months since the @entity20 regime fell , the @entity3 has brought oil production back up to 300 - 400,000 barrels per day			1
from now every extra 100,000 barrels will be more difficult , costly and time - consuming to bring back			0
thousands of workers have to return , and a huge amount of investment is required to recapitalize the oil field camps , many of which have been looted over the past six months			2
some wells will also need repair as will the main export terminals in the @entity158 , which suffered the most damage in the conflict			0
the gas potential is huge and largely unrealized			2
@entity7 already sends gas to @entity63 by pipeline , but it is a much less significant producer than its neighbor @entity166			1
it would like to find more gas and take a larger slice of the @entity88 market			2
@entity96 and @entity95 are amongst those already involved in expensive projects to make this happen			0
new exploration contracts could be issued : @entity9 and @entity8 companies could benefit			1
@entity63 's @entity175 is already a predominant player , and has returned to the country more quickly than its competitors			0
but they are not the only contenders			0
some analysts expect that @entity182 , holder of the world 's third largest gas reserves and a vital supporter of the @entity3 , may work alongside @entity7 to market any future gas to @entity88 , perhaps cooperating on @entity189 developments			1
in any case , the gas has to be found first			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194			0

the @entity8 and @entity9 support of the @entity7 revolution was not all about oil
however , there are questions around whether they expect a bounty in return for their support
contracts to help the state oil company improve production and further exploration rights for gas could be up for grabs
