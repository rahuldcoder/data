-- feeding @entity2 's hungry school children is an undertaking unparalleled anywhere -- the $ 22 billion - a - year scheme provides a hot meal to an estimated 120 million students every school day			1
@entity9 , an economist at the @entity10 who has studied the scheme , credits the " very ambitious , very large and very popular " program with having a huge impact on student enrollment and attendance in a country in which , according to official government figures , nearly half of all children are malnourished			1
but the tragic deaths of at least 22 children and hospitalization of 24 more after eating a school meal in @entity2 's northeastern @entity26 state highlight the failings of the program to provide healthy -- or even safe -- meals , in some parts of the country where governance , accountability and poverty remain entrenched issues			1

the circumstances leading up to the contamination , which has provoked violent protests in the region , remain murky , with the school 's principal and her husband having absconded and currently being sought by authorities , area police chief @entity45 told @entity0			2
but @entity26 state education minister @entity54 has said the children were poisoned by an insecticide that was in the food			1
officials believe the substance involved was organophosphorus , a chemical that the @entity63 @entity62 says is commonly used in agriculture			0
@entity9 said the national school meal program had its origins in a landmark decision by @entity2 's @entity68 in 2001 that decreed all government schools were required to provide free meals to students below the age of 13			1
until that point , the schools had been discharging their commitments to child nutrition " by giving children 3kg of wheat or rice every month in lieu of giving them meals , " she said			1
" the court said ' this will not do			0
' " within a year , most states had implemented systems to offer daily meals to their students , but in @entity26 -- one of @entity2 's poorest states she said , with a track record of poor governance and social welfare -- it took two years to start providing the service			1
" @entity26 is always a little bit behind everything , " she said			0
" around 2004 - 5 , they started rubbing their eyes and waking up and saying , ' okay , we 've got to get on this thing			0
' " read more : feeding school children in @entity104 on the whole , the program -- aimed at achieving educational and nutritional goals in one swoop -- has been hailed as a success , with studies showing significant increases in enrollment and attendance , particularly among disadvantaged groups , such as girls , dalits and adivasis , said @entity9			1
" by and large , it is a very important program and it has had a very good effect			2
" but the quality of the service has varied greatly across the country			2
some states , such as @entity124 and @entity125 , developed sophisticated programs to deliver a quality service			2
by contrast , a 2010 study by @entity2 's @entity130 reported that more than 70 % of children in schools surveyed in @entity26 were unhappy with the quality of their meals , three - quarters of the schools reported they lacked proper utensils , and many schools in @entity26 complained of receiving their food supplies on a haphazard basis , resulting in hygiene issues			1
" problems still remain , especially in states like @entity26 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , " she said			2
" there is a very serious problem of administrative capacity and law			0
the implementation is poor , the money they put into the program is very little and so the quality of the food that is provided in this region is a general concern			1
they 're still struggling with issues that a place like @entity124 was dealing with 10 years ago			0
" the fact that there were no answers days after the tragedy was " a reflection of the lackadaisical attitude of the @entity26 government , " she said			0
" @entity26 needs to put mechanisms in place that will allow it to monitor these meals more effectively			0
" further complicating the picture , she said , was the role of private contractors in the food supply chain , motivated by the promise of profiting from the government - funded programs			0
" when you bring in contractors to supply meals , these people only come in it for the money			0
and when they come in for the money , they 're going to skimp any way they can -- by cutting corners , " she said			0
@entity194 , @entity0 's sister network , reported @entity26 's education minister @entity195 as claiming the school principal 's husband was the supplier of the food for the school meals			1
@entity0 has been unable to verify his claims with the principal or her husband , who authorities say have " absconded			0
" @entity9 said that while contaminated school meals were not unheard of across the country , an incident on this scale would hopefully serve as a wake - up call to authorities to improve the service where it was required			2
" but it 's hard to see that happening , because there 's a general problem of a lack of accountability , particularly in this state , " she said .			0

@entity2 provides a free hot meal a day to every student below the age of 13
it is the largest program of its kind , feeding 120 million children every school day
the scheme is *designed* to tackle education and nutrition in one swoop
but the quality of the food varies wildly , with some states providing *substandard* meals
