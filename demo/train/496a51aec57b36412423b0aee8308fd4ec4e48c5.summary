@entity0 -- the first time i held a premature baby was nearly two decades ago during medical school			1
the baby weighed just 3 pounds , and i remember being so afraid i might drop her			2
while i stared into her eyes , it gave me goose bumps			1
the parents had n't yet given her a name because they worried she would n't survive			2
the neonatal @entity13 ( @entity14 ) nurses were truly remarkable , taking care of these preemies , and making it all seem so effortless			2
i do remember the most anxiety - provoking times surrounded the transport of these babies			1
even if it was just one floor away , there was a plan laid out with clear communication and a defined role for the half a dozen @entity14 nurses who would accompany the baby			0
there was a commander of the transport , and several contingencies for worst - case scenarios			1
i remember asking one of the nurses , " what is the safest way to transport this baby ? " her reply : " in the womb			0
" she was right , and if you consider the number of risks to a premature baby , you understand why			1
the heart rate of tiny babies can suddenly drop , and they can even develop a complete heart block			2
they require oxygen , but not too much because they are at risk of oxygen toxicity to their lungs			0
they can barely regulate their temperature , and they have a larger body surface area to mass ratio , which makes the problem even worse			0
they can lose fluids rapidly , and they do n't yet have glycogen stores in their liver			0
so , not getting a timely meal could prove fatal			0
imagine any of these things happening outside of the @entity13 , and now compound that by 100			0
that is what took place monday night at @entity68 's @entity67			1
as you watch the video of these babies being rushed through the streets of @entity0 , you now have a better idea of just how involved all of this really was			2
at about 10:30 p.m. monday , with generators failing and widespread internal flooding , hospital staff called the ceo of @entity80 , dr. @entity81 , and asked for help			0
he immediately approved the transfer of 64 patients , including three mothers in labor and seven newborn babies			1
one of them was @entity89 , just 13 days old and weighing only 2 pounds			1
@entity89 's parents were in @entity91 , watching in horror as they learned the hospital was being evacuated			1
shortly thereafter , they lost power and had no way of driving back into the city of @entity97			0
as a parent myself , that part of their story really got to me the most			0
they were completely in the dark , stranded and helpless			0
i met @entity89 just a few hours after she arrived at @entity80			1
she was in the @entity14 , and was perfectly stable			2
there were lots of tears of joy in the hospital , as families were reunited for the first time			0
resilient , was how one of the nurses described little @entity89			1
still gives me goose bumps .			1

transporting premature babies can be anxiety - provoking , @entity116 says
their medical needs make them especially fragile
@entity89 was among patients evacuated from @entity67
@entity116 says meeting @entity89 , who is stable , gave him goose bumps
