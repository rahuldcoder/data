a @entity2 teacher who served 31 days in jail for raping a 14 - year - old girl who later killed herself must be re-sentenced , the @entity0 ordered wednesday			1
the court ruled that @entity7 's original sentence was inadequate and outside legislative guidelines , which it said should have ensured @entity7 spend at least two years behind bars			1
the justices also barred judge g. @entity11 , who drew a firestorm of criticism for levying the original sentence last year , from imposing the new sentence , saying a new judge was needed " to preserve the appearance of fairness and justice			1
" authorities said @entity7 raped @entity21 , one of his students at a @entity25 , @entity2 , high school , in 2007			2
@entity21 committed suicide in february 2010 , before the case went to trial			1
@entity7 pleaded guilty to sexual intercourse without consent , and last year @entity11 sentenced him to 15 years in prison , with all but 31 days suspended			1
that meant serving 31 days in jail and more than 14 years on probation			2
@entity11 's comments at the sentencing in august sparked controversy			0
he said the girl looked older than her years and was " probably as much in control of the situation as was the defendant , " according to the @entity2 attorney general 's office , which appealed the sentence			1
in wednesday 's decision , the @entity45 ruled that @entity11 used an inapplicable statute to impose the 31 - day sentence			1
when read properly , @entity2 law mandates a minimum four - year prison sentence -- with a suspension of no more than two years -- for the rape of children under 16 by someone at least three years older , the court ruled			1
explaining its decision to give the new sentence to a different judge , the court blasted @entity11 's previous comments about the case			2
at the august sentencing , @entity11 said the victim looked older than her years and was " probably as much in control of the situation as was the defendant , " according to the @entity2 attorney general 's office			1
@entity11 's comments reflected an improper bias and " cast serious doubt on the appearance of justice , " state @entity67 @entity66 wrote in wednesday 's ruling			0
@entity11 apologized for the comments in november			0
writing to a judicial review board , he said : " i am sorry i made those remarks			0
they focused on the victim when that aspect of the case should have been focused on the defendant			2
" but he defended the overall decision in december , calling it " the right kind of sentence			0
" the review board filed a complaint against @entity11 in february , saying his actions in the @entity7 case " eroded public confidence " in the judicial system			0
in wednesday 's ruling , @entity92 wrote that the @entity45 would address the complaint in a separate hearing			0
@entity11 told @entity95 affiliate @entity94 in january that he would retire at the end of the year , and that his decision was n't related to the @entity99 controversy			0
authorities said @entity7 had sexual relations with @entity21 in fall 2007 , when she was 14 and a student in one of his classes at @entity105			0
she confided in a church group leader , and @entity7 was charged in october 2008 .			0
