-- every week , there 's a new @entity3 thing to gripe about			1
this week , there have been two -- and it 's only tuesday			2
on sunday , it was discovered that the 900 million - person social network was " testing " a feature that would let people see a digital list of the people who were nearby in real life			2
called " @entity16 , " the app was pulled down by tuesday morning after the @entity15 freaked out			1
commenters said things like " hell to the naw " and " bad facebook ! ! " and generally complaining that the feature , which was difficult to find , much less use , invades privacy and will lead to stalking			2
if that 's not enough , a company named @entity25 reportedly threatened a lawsuit , saying @entity3 stole its idea for the location - aware feature			1
apparently , @entity25 would like to share the heat			0
item two : a blogger noticed over the weekend that @entity3 , without asking permission , had changed the default e-mail addresses of all of its digital residents to @ facebook.com accounts			1
it 's easy enough to change back , as the site @entity39 and others have detailed , but that little invasion of the hub of digital identity -- the @entity44 -- was enough to make quite a few @entity45 fire back at their digital overlords			0
security researchers called the move dangerous			0
" up next : facebook inside your underwear drawer ! " a commenter wrote on our site			0
so that was this week			0
but it seems like every week has been feeling a little like that			0
the fact that an @entity61 sentiment bubbles beneath the currents of modern life is , of course , nothing new			0
when the company introduced the now - popular @entity67 in september 2006 , users threw a fit -- and many abandoned the young network , at least for a moment			1
let 's put the brakes on for just a second and ask a few questions : are people mad about @entity3 's individual decisions -- the e-mail , the tracking , the @entity67 -- or do the roots of this discontent reach into deeper , darker places ? if it 's the latter , why are people so continually frustrated ? do we hold @entity3 to too high of a standard ? is the social network turning its back on users ? or is it just that our digital lives are now so invested in @entity3 that it would be nearly impossible to pull out at this point -- and , because of that , we feel helpless ? here are a few theories about what 's actually going on with people 's unhappiness with @entity3			1
take a look and let us know which you think is most accurate -- or offer up a theory of your own -- in the comments			0
@entity3 has become an octopus and by " octopus " we mean it 's got too many tentacles to manage			1
this theory is put forward by the blog the @entity108 , which says @entity3 is buying too many new companies -- @entity110 , @entity111 -- and trying too many new things			1
( this is a critique more commonly lobbed at @entity114 , especially when it was launching one product after the next that flopped : @entity118 , @entity119 , etc. , etc. ) " when you start packing in more features while you 're removing none of them , feature creep will happen and users will start to ask the question ' why ca n't they just make it easy for me to talk to my friends ? ' " @entity120 wrote			1
" after all , that 's why people started leaving @entity133 to go to @entity3 in the first place , because it simply tried to do too much			1
" writing for @entity136 , @entity135 puts it this way : " @entity3 would love to be the all - inclusive resort of the @entity140 , replete with complementary digital daiquiris ( that you 're forced to chug ) upon entry			1
" @entity3 is a technocracy , and we want a democracy as @entity147 writes for the @entity148 , @entity3 has evolved into a " technocracy " : a government of sorts that 's run by engineers who value efficiency above all else			1
when you complain to the real - world government , you can expect a response -- or you can use your voting power ( or run for office ) to push for change			0
at @entity3 , 2 million complaints per week are handled largely by computers and a staff of a few hundred people			1
their aim is to process as many issues per day as possible , to help people connect and , as @entity147 puts it , to stop people from leaving the site " by minimizing their negative experiences			0
" " @entity3 's desire for efficiency means democracy is out and technocratic , developer - king rule is in , " he writes			1
even when the site does give its users a chance to weigh in on policy , @entity147 says , users do n't take up the offer			0
in a vote about a recent privacy policy change , 0.038 % of users participated			0
there 's no competition hope and pray all you want , but there 's no other online social network with 900 million people			0
chances are , most of your friends are on @entity3 , so even if you try to go to a competing network like @entity197 , it might be as fun as talking to your cat			2
here 's a list of alternatives from our @entity203 blog , but none of them seems like actual competition in terms of numbers			0
@entity3 cares more about investors than users @entity3 went public this year , leading to criticisms that the site 's motives have changed			1
is it focused on cash instead of users ? while that complaint may be premature -- ceo @entity217 maintains a majority stake in the company , so he does n't have to listen to investors and his board all that much -- the company 's ipo , and the billionaires and millionaires who resulted from it , doubtlessly cloud how people see @entity3 's motives			1
and it does n't help to know that , in mid-may , you were worth only $ 1.21 to @entity3			2
" how much does @entity3 value its users ? in strictly monetary terms , about as much as a bag of chips , " @entity231 wrote for our sister site @entity234			1
or , as @entity242 put it , @entity3 is " conducting an experiment in corporate dictatorship nearly without precedent for such a large and high - profile company			1
" @entity3 is no fun ( anymore ... ) i put the question of what 's really wrong with @entity3 out on my @entity197 feed , in part because that network is a hotbed for @entity3 defectors			2
several followers brought up interesting points , the simplest of which is that @entity3 , as it grew , became un-fun			2
" @entity3 started as a social network that was ' fun ' to update your friends and classmates ( since it started for - college students only ) and grew into something that can affect your career , reputation and invade your privacy , " one user , identified as @entity257 , wrote			2
here 's another thought , from a person identified as @entity269 : " bombardment with stories you do n't care about from people you barely care about			0
depression that you 're jealously stalking other 's lives instead of living your own			0
the more content you absorb , the less valuable your own posts seem			0
" and i 'll give the final word to @entity282 , who wrote , simply : " everyone uses @entity3 but nobody likes it			2
" let us know what you think in the comments below .			0
