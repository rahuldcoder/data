@entity0 -- on this day 100 years ago , troops in the city of @entity4 , in @entity7 's @entity6 province , launched a coup against local authorities			1
the coup ignited a civil war that ended in the collapse of @entity7 's 2,200 - year - old imperial system			1
when a republican government established itself in 1912 , it designated october 10 as the national holiday			0
even now , " @entity21 " remains the equivalent of the @entity17 of the island of @entity19 and for many overseas @entity7 communities			2
on the mainland , however , the ten - ten holiday has always been a more ambiguous affair , and so it remains on this centenary			0
the @entity27 reported : " the government held low - key celebrations sunday marking the centennial anniversary of the revolution that ended thousands of years of imperial rule and set the stage for the birth of today 's @entity7			1
@entity7 president @entity35 and other dignitaries gathered in @entity38 's @entity37 , under a giant portrait of @entity40 , the first president of the @entity41 -- the name still carried by modern - day @entity19			1
@entity35 called for the peaceful reunification of @entity7 and @entity19 and reiterated his opposition to @entity19 independence			2
" beyond this political lecture , however , the anniversary was observed in remarkably muted style			2
a new museum opened in @entity51			0
a historical movie was aired on state tv			0
some events will be held in the hometown of @entity40 , the revolution 's moral leader and the first president of the @entity7 republic			1
but there 's nothing remotely on the scale of the @entity62 , let alone the @entity63			2
and after all , that diffident approach should come as no surprise			0
although the present government of @entity7 touts its nationalist credentials , it was born in rebellion -- not against imperial overlords , not against colonialist oppressors , not against @entity73 invaders , but precisely against the inheritors of the republic established by the events of 1911 : the @entity78 party created by @entity40 the memory of 1911 is embarrassing in many other ways to the present government			1
1911 was a revolution inspired by ideals of democracy and personal liberty			1
those ideals are cynically disregarded -- or brutally suppressed -- by @entity7 's present government			1
1911 was a revolution in defense of traditional @entity7 culture against a foreign dynasty , @entity91 who had ruled in @entity7 since 1644			1
but who has done more damage to traditional @entity7 culture than the regime in place since 1949 ? and not only to the bulldozed monuments of @entity7 , but to the country 's inheritance of art and scholarship , reviled and massacred in the @entity102			1
a country ruled by people who took power by violence -- and now hold power by repression -- is not a country that dares look honestly at its past			0
a year ago , i had the opportunity to visit a museum of the @entity102 in @entity116 province , one of only two such in the entire vastness of the country			0
it was an against - the - odds achievement that the museum could be built at all , but the price of building it was to tell the story in a way that focused almost exclusively on the victimization of some members of the @entity127 by other members			0
the authors of the museum bought the freedom to tell a portion of the story by suppressing all the rest			0
as for the other traumas of @entity7 's recent history -- including the terrible self - inflicted famine culminating in mass cannibalism that goes by the mocking name " the @entity140 " -- they can only be whispered , if they are discussed at all			1
the man guilty of those terrible atrocities , @entity143 , still overlooks @entity38 from a giant portrait over @entity145			0
so long as the leaders of @entity7 trace their power to @entity143 's legacy , that long will @entity7 be obliged to lie to itself about its history			1
" the struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting			0
" so wrote @entity154 about the communist regimes of central @entity156			0
his words apply as aptly to the regime that governs our planet 's most populous nation and most ancient continuing civilization			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .			2

monday marks 100th anniversary of revolution against @entity7 's imperial system
@entity165 says the @entity7 leaders are *n't* confronting truth of that event
he says @entity7 's regime *spurns* ideals of democracy and liberty
