@entity0 -- it 's primary day in @entity0 , where a whole lot of @entity6 and not that many @entity4 will select their nominees for mayor and a slate of other city offices			1
given the city 's liberal bent , the primary serves as a de facto general election			0
most of tuesday 's @entity6 winners will sail to victory in november against token @entity4 opposition			1
but @entity0 has n't elected a @entity6 mayor since 1989 , when @entity20 became the city 's first @entity22 - @entity22 mayor			1
this is shaping up to be the year that streak ends			0
mayor @entity26 has presided over more than a decade of economic expansion in the city , but his tenure has left a sour taste in the mouths of rank - and - file democrats , who say the mayor cares more about wealthy @entity36 elites than the outer borough middle class			1
the issues flaring this election season all seem to come back to @entity41 : affordable housing , income inequality , education , a city council vote that handed the mayor a third term , and the controversial @entity49 tactic known as stop - and - frisk			1
@entity41 fatigue is the prime reason that @entity53 , the city 's public advocate , has surged into the lead in a crowded field of underwhelming @entity6 candidates			1
@entity59 is promising a " clean break " from the @entity41 years			2
he 's running as an unabashed liberal , pledging to raise taxes on the wealthy and end stop - and - frisk			1
@entity59 , who is white , also happens to be leading his opponents among @entity22 voters , in part because of his telegenic mixed - race family , which has been at his side throughout the campaign			2
polls suggest @entity59 is certain to win tuesday 's primary			2
the main question is whether he can run up the score high enough to avoid a runoff against one of his two main challengers : city council speaker @entity78 , a lesbian who would be @entity0 's first female mayor , and @entity80 , the city 's former comptroller			1
former @entity84 rep. @entity83 , whose campaign imploded in july after he admitted to sending another round of lewd online chats well after he resigned from @entity88 , is running in a distant fourth place			1
here are five things to watch in tuesday 's election , which will also determine whether former @entity0 gov. @entity92 can make a political comeback after a prostitution scandal forced him from office five years ago : 1			1
can @entity53 avoid a runoff ? @entity59 was handed a big fat gift over the weekend when @entity98 posted a buzzy new interview with @entity41 in which the mayor described @entity53 's campaign , which has showcased his interracial family in a bid to win @entity22 - @entity22 support , as " racist			1
" the @entity105 promptly put his family in front of television news cameras to hit back against the mayor , who has steadfastly backed the @entity49 's stop - and - frisk policy , a deeply unpopular practice in the city 's black community			1
a former political operative and onetime city councilman from @entity116 , @entity53 was already surging before the comments hit the web on saturday morning			0
now @entity53 might be able to reach the crucial 40 % threshold needed to avoid a three - week runoff campaign , a once unthinkable scenario given the number of @entity6 in the race			1
a @entity125 poll released monday by @entity126 @entity0 and the @entity127 pegged @entity53 's support among @entity6 at 36 %			1
with all the political wind in the race at his back , it 's possible he might win the nomination outright on tuesday			1
where do @entity22 - @entity22 voters go ? the most influential person in the mayor 's race is n't even on the ballot			1
that would be @entity53 's 15 - year old son @entity142 , who starred in a memorable television ad that vaulted his father to the top of the polls in august			2
he has n't looked back since			0
in the ad , @entity142 , who boasts an impressive @entity147 , looks into the camera and pledges that his father is " the only @entity150 with the guts to really break from the @entity41 years " and " end a stop - and - frisk era that unfairly targets people of color			1
" the @entity142 spot , produced by former @entity158 campaign media consultant @entity156 , sparked one of the most intriguing developments of the primary : @entity53 has steadily been growing his support among @entity22 voters -- even against @entity80 , the lone black candidate in the field			0
@entity59 now leads @entity80 among black voters by a 39 - 25 margin , the @entity125 poll showed			0
he 's also identified as the candidate most likely to end stop - and - frisk			2
@entity80 was the 2009 @entity6 nominee for mayor and bucked conventional wisdom -- and many polls -- by coming within five points of defeating @entity41 that november			1
if @entity80 is to have any chance of making the runoff and beating @entity53 , he better hope the polls are wrong again			0
@entity177 and the @entity178 @entity180 's city council district encompasses @entity177 and stretches of @entity178 , which represent the historic heart of @entity0 's gay and lesbian community			0
the @entity188 , on the corner of @entity186 and @entity187 , serves as @entity180 's second office			2
last friday evening , @entity180 rallied hundreds of gay and lesbian supporters outside the @entity193 , site of the historic 1969 gay rights demonstrations against the @entity49			0
but disgruntled @entity180 supporters have faulted her for not drawing more attention to the history - making nature of her candidacy			0
@entity180 , once the front - runner , now desperately needs her @entity204 base to show up if she has any hope of making a runoff			1
there are hints her support could be fracturing under the weight of her complicated relationship with @entity41 in the city council , and @entity53 's late burst of momentum			2
when @entity53 showed up late last week to campaign in @entity180 's backyard , on the corner of @entity186 and @entity217 , he was mobbed by photo - seeking supporters and held court for nearly an hour , jamming up foot traffic and putting the @entity223 speaker on notice			2
on monday night , @entity180 's campaign added a last - minute campaign swing through @entity177 to shore up her base			2
can @entity92 make a comeback ? @entity92 , who resigned from office in a 2008 prostitution scandal that roiled @entity232 , surprised pretty much everyone in politics in july when he suddenly jumped into the @entity6 race for city comptroller , the city 's chief fiscal officer			1
with the help of his real estate fortune , his unabashed @entity241 rhetoric and his near universal name recognition , @entity92 led his @entity6 primary opponent , @entity244 president @entity243 , for most of the summer			2
but @entity243 has worked overtime to remind voters of @entity92 's baggage , attacking him in debates , in the mail and on the television airwaves			0
@entity92 has returned fire , accusing @entity243 of being a lifelong member of the political establishment who accomplished little during his public career			0
the race is the most intriguing head - to - head match - up on tuesday			2
recent polls paint a mixed picture but suggest the race is something of a toss - up , though @entity92 may have a slight edge thanks to his steady 2 - 1 edge among @entity22 voters			0
if he wins the nomination , he 's a sure bet to become comptroller against nominal @entity4 opposition and see his name bandied about as a potential future mayor , attorney general or governor			0
a win tuesday would be his first step toward political redemption			0
the end of " @entity277 " the @entity4 primary contest has been largely overlooked given the city 's @entity6 leanings			1
roughly 700,000 democrats are expected to cast ballots in tuesday 's primary , while @entity4 turnout may be as low as 60,000			0
@entity285 , a fedora - wearing veteran of @entity287 's administration , is expected to win the @entity4 nod			0
if the @entity289 wins the @entity6 primary as expected , @entity285 might have an outside shot in the general election if he 's able to enlist @entity41 allies and the business community , no fans of @entity53 's tax - the - rich agenda , to help defeat him			1
but a @entity285 win would also be the political death knell for @entity299 , arguably the most colorful figure of the 2013 election cycle			0
@entity302 , the @entity304 - born billionaire founder of the @entity306 grocery store chain and a longtime @entity4 donor , poured millions of dollars of his own money into the race , blanketing the television airwaves with quirky television ads. according to the @entity314 , " he has even created his own eight - page newspaper , @entity312 , which includes no fewer than 27 photographs of mr. @entity299			0
" politically incorrect , often disheveled and definitely overweight , @entity302 has some regular guy appeal but is nevertheless prone to missteps and cringe - worthy statements that make him hard to take seriously			0
he even fell asleep in the middle of an interview with a @entity0 public radio reporter , who recorded him snoring and used the sound in her story			0
@entity325 , a @entity0 @entity150 who tweets prolifically under the handle @ @entity327 , spoke for political junkies everywhere on sunday when he mourned @entity302 ' imminent demise : " i 'll never let @entity330 go , even after he loses the @entity4 primary for @entity0 mayor on tuesday , " he tweeted			0
" he is a treasure to behold and quote			0

mayoral race will mark the end of @entity41 's decade of control of mayor 's office
*disgraced* former @entity84 rep. @entity343 is running a distant fourth in @entity6 race
