-- why was @entity1 17 flying over war - torn eastern @entity2 ? " we , along with hundreds of other airlines , have flown that route safely for quite some time , " @entity3 , commercial director for @entity4 , told @entity0 's @entity5 over the weekend			1
" primarily we flew that route because we were advised that this was a safe corridor and there would be no incidents			2
" @entity3 said the plane , which was traveling from @entity12 to @entity13 , adjusted its altitude on its way across @entity16 under the direction of air traffic control			2
now , he said the airline is reassessing the route it uses for that flight			1
and since thursday 's crash , commercial airlines that usually cross eastern @entity2 on their flights to @entity16 , @entity24 and elsewhere have been detouring away from the volatile region			1
but far beyond @entity2 's borders , analysts say the incident could pave the way for new guidelines for how close planes can fly to conflict zones			1
" the rules in aviation are written in blood , or a tombstone mentality if you like , " @entity0 aviation analyst @entity34 said			0
" what happens is , people die , and things get safer			0
" @entity43 , a @entity0 safety analyst and former @entity45 safety inspector , said the situation highlights the need for change in an antiquated system that has what he calls a " flaw in the evaluation of the risk			0
" eight unanswered questions " there had been aircraft shot down just prior to this , " @entity43 said			0
" someone should have taken action			0
" last week @entity61 , the agency responsible for coordinating @entity16 airspace , said @entity2 authorities had closed airspace in the region below 32,000 feet , but it was open at the level @entity67 was flying ( 33,000 feet )			0
" there 's a lot of questions to be asked in a lot of different places , " @entity34 said			2
" @entity1 , for example , what about the airline policy ? what did they inform crews and flight dispatchers about flying through that particular part of the world ? and why did n't government officials close off that airspace completely ? 32,000 feet , that 's a completely arbitrary number			1
" the president of @entity90 's @entity89 airline is calling for an international meeting of carriers to come up with a response to the downing of the plane , @entity86 reported on sunday			1
the @entity97 's @entity96 ca n't close airspace , @entity89 president @entity99 told @entity86 , " but they can issue advisories and they may be a little more active			2
" and national regulators " may start getting involved a little more than they have , " @entity99 said , according to @entity86			0
" they have perhaps left airlines to their own devices			0
" the airline chief 's comments are a good sign that changes soon could be in the works , @entity34 said			1
@entity112 , a @entity0 aviation analyst and commercial pilot , said before last week 's crash , pilots were n't worried about missiles hitting planes they were flying			1
" none of us , i think , would have conceived that kind of devastation from a surface - to - air missile , " he said			0
" evading missiles ( is ) not part of our training			0
that 's just something that 's not in our vocabulary at this point and time			1
" but now , he said , guidelines for pilots will likely change			2
" now we 've got a new threat that we 've got to deal with , " he said			2
" now we 've lost lives			0
" @entity4 retires flight number , offers full refunds who were the victims ? @entity0 's @entity141 contributed to this report .			1

@entity4 *executive* on plane 's route : we 've flown it safely " for quite some time "
now , he says , the airline is reassessing the route
analysts say the crash of @entity156 could lead to new guidelines
