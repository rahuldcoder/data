in a scathing report , the @entity1 @entity0 on monday accused the @entity3 in @entity4 of engaging in a pattern of widespread discrimination against @entity7 in violation of the @entity9 and federal law			1
" we find that @entity3 engages in discriminatory policing against @entity7 , including but not limited to targeting @entity7 for discriminatory traffic enforcement , treating @entity21 drivers more harshly than @entity23 drivers after a traffic stop , and intentionally and woefully failing to design and implement internal systems of control that would identify , track , and prevent such misconduct , " assistant attorney general @entity11 wrote in a 23 - page letter to the @entity14 mayor , detailing the results of a two - year investigation			1

overall , the investigation found that 19.9 % of traffic stops made by the @entity3 were of @entity21 drivers , concluding it " shows pervasive discrimination against @entity7 on every level of @entity3 traffic enforcement activity			1
" the report also said officers were able to target @entity7 by focusing on customers leaving @entity21 businesses			1
in addition to the high rate of traffic stops , the report accused some @entity3 officers of conducting unauthorized immigration investigations			0
the report mentioned " numerous incident reports " where @entity3 officers contacted @entity55 ( @entity55 ) to check on the status or seek an immigration detention of a @entity21 person			2
investigators said the tactic was " used to harass and intimidate @entity7 rather than pursue legitimate law enforcement objectives			0
