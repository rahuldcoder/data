-- can graphic design help protect your privacy ? @entity4 , a designer and former @entity6 contractor , thinks so			1
just months after @entity9 controversially lifted the lid on digital surveillance being conducted by the @entity12 and other governments , the issue of online privacy is back in the spotlight			0
earlier this month @entity16 ceo @entity15 expressed concern that users ' trust in internet companies had been damaged by the revelations			0
@entity23 's @entity22 also called for greater transparency from the @entity12 government over surveillance			0
@entity4 's response was more direct -- the @entity29 designer has created four new fonts called @entity31 that aim to disrupt the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) systems used by @entity23 and others to analyze text			1
@entity31 type specimen video from @entity4 on @entity37			1
" i decided to create a typeface that would be unreadable by text scanning software ( whether used by a government agency or a lone hacker ) , " @entity4 told @entity0 via email , " misdirecting information or sometimes not giving any at all			1
" @entity4 , who worked with the @entity6 during his time in the @entity29 military , says that a number of global developments motivated him to act : " the news about the @entity6 secretly building the country 's biggest data center ; the @entity51 passing the controversial @entity52 ( @entity52 ) ; the social network media accumulating abundant information on every individual 's life ; @entity23 announcing its work - in - progress @entity57 -- and the list goes on			1
" " sometimes these ideas about privacy can feel large and abstract to the average person			0
i thought that addressing these issues through the design of a typeface -- a building block of language and communication -- would bring home the conversation to the average person , " @entity4 says			2
the four different fonts -- @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 -- were developed through a rigorous process of drawing and testing , @entity4 says : " the challenge was to make the @entity32 legible typeface illegible to computer vision , while keeping it readable to the human eye			1
" each font uses a different optical trick to make them difficult to scan : ' @entity87 ' adds camouflage - like patterns over letters , ' @entity74 ' overlays the letters with dots , ' xed ' puts a neat x across each character , and ' @entity95 ' uses a small letter beneath a larger ' false ' one			0
@entity97 , research professor of @entity99 at @entity100 , says that of the four different fonts , ' @entity95 ' could be most promising , but that in his view camouflaged fonts are not terribly effective at protecting people 's privacy : " for standard optical character recognition that 's tuned to read traditional typefaces and handwriting , yes , i think ( these fonts ) will be confusing ... but if the @entity6 really wants to detect this data ? not really			2
the problem here is that the fonts do n't appear to be randomized , which means every time i type the letter ' a ' i 'll get the same letter			2
to an @entity32 program these letters are just shapes			2
the funny - looking a shape is no more difficult to detect than a real a shape			0
" @entity121 , professor in @entity122 at the @entity123 , shares @entity97 's criticisms : " i do n't think any of this is more than privacy theater			0
the fonts could probably be broken			2
" @entity4 concedes that the fonts ' actual effectiveness may be limited , but that he hopes they will alert people to the issue of digital surveillance : " @entity31 is a call to action , both practically and symbolically , to raise questions about privacy			1
intercepting and storing world citizens ' words and thoughts is simply a vulgar intrusion on our daily lives ... it 's our duty to call out crimes against democracy			0
" @entity4 's fonts are available for download here			1
@entity121 's font can be found here .			0

designer @entity4 creates ' *unhackable* ' fonts
the four fonts are designed to disrupt @entity32 software
*experts* *suggest* that to be effective such fonts would need to be used with *encryption*
