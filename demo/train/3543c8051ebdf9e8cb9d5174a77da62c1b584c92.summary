@entity0 , @entity1 -- the drive leading to @entity5 's house is lush with trees and water , and marked with the occasional yellow sign			1
" @entity10 , " one warns , showing the silhouette of a dog			0
another urges visitors to drive slowly : " do n't hurt my critters			1
" this from the " @entity24 , " a rocker famous for decades of thrashing guitars with " 10 digits of rhythm and blues doom , " a hunter and reality show star known for killing whatever game he spots , and an outspoken conservative whose fiery talk has earned him a visit from the @entity22			1
it 's a mild summer afternoon , and he 's just back home from a show that kept him up until 3 a.m. he 's a little tired and the water by the dock is calm			2
@entity35 , @entity5 's hunting dog , is blissfully rolling in the dirt at his feet			1
" did you feel your soul being cleansed , just on the driveway ? " @entity5 demands			1
" was it beautiful , or what ? " he 's not really looking for an answer			2
he just likes to talk about this patch of wetland , a fen he says provides for oodles of frogs , deer and the rare @entity52			0
" this is a piece of private ground that is thriving biodiversity , " he says			0
" i could n't be more proud			2
" so this is @entity5 offstage , @entity5 at age 63			1
the @entity1 native is still excitable , opinionated and loud , especially since his hearing is n't so great these days			1
he punctuates almost every rant and declaration by shouting " are you kidding me ? ! " or " are n't i adorable ? ! " but he says this place gives him balance			2
he can riff about music with his band members , spend time with his wife , @entity67 , or dole out belly rubs to the dogs			2
( there are three : aging @entity71 is a little creaky and just barely tolerating the bouncy , spotlight - stealing puppy , @entity74			0
@entity35 is the " the wonder lab , the master hunter , " a retriever who 'd bring back any rabbit , possum or woodchuck			0
" he 's a good dog and he loves his daddy , " @entity5 says			1
) most likely , this is the place @entity5 would climb into a deer blind and sit silently for hours , thinking about everything or nothing			1
" i want to play music during the spring and summer , but then i want to go hunting every fall and winter , " he says			1
the music is " so intense			2
it 's so draining , you push yourself such outrageous , animal limits			2
in order to maintain that intensity , i have to get away from it			1
" getting away means spending time on his land in @entity97 or in " my swamps " right here			1
they 'll dine tonight in the log cabin house a short walk from the dock , probably on something he shot with a bow and arrow			0
@entity5 says he does n't do anything fancy for those meals -- he does n't want to tarnish what nature provided -- but they 'll sometimes use a marinade of garlic , pepper , olive oil and @entity115 's , @entity1 's beloved , peppery ginger ale			1
" here is the beauty of my perfect life : me , my dogs , my family , all of them , my band , my crew , my drivers , my pilot , my guys , my outfitters , my frogs , my production team , everybody			0
meet anybody in @entity5 's life ? kickin ' ass			1
" everybody in my world is good			0
" @entity137 tell @entity138 what 's wrong with @entity140 while he believes everyone in his life is good , and he is always right , he 's willing to say that was n't always true			1
he does have some regrets			2
he did n't go to legendary hunter @entity146 's birthday party			1
thought he was too busy			0
" maybe you 've heard the song ? never should 've been recorded			0
he should n't have exploded during a @entity153 interview earlier this year , when he used some language he wo n't repeat now			2
during the interview , he lashed out at the notion he 's extreme , directing some of his bleeped - out response at an off - camera producer			2
@entity5 says he was passing a kidney stone at the time and taking pain relievers -- " thought i was giving birth to a hedgehog			1
" he regrets that he " went into this disgusting street rant " instead of keeping control			2
( a few weeks earlier , @entity5 stirred controversy by saying he 'd be " dead or in jail " if @entity166 was re-elected			1
@entity167 was concerned enough to stop by and the @entity168 canceled his @entity170 show			2
he did n't list it among his regrets			1
) and there 's this : he loved his dad for the discipline , but @entity177 , he says , made him everything he is			0
@entity179 was buoyant and loud and excitable , and she supported him from the moment he bought that big blond @entity181 , his first guitar			0
he did n't go to her funeral			1
" i loved my mom so dearly			0
i was with her throughout her illness			0
i was not a funeral guy ...			0
it was always so ritualistic			0
i did n't feel that was the relationship , " he says			0
" i did n't understand funerals			0
" after she died in 1989 , he buried her remains here in his @entity1 swamps , he says			1
" it was a solemn experience , " he says			0
" the breeze is picking up			0
@entity197 's talking to us right now			0
" he still does n't see his family -- his grandkids -- as much as he 'd like			1
@entity5 will catch a few days with them during his tour , or when he heads back to @entity97			1
they call him @entity205 , he says , and they will wrestle and play as much as his knees ( and his children , their parents ) allow			0
" i 've been blamed by my children that i make it more difficult to put ( the grandkids ) to bedtime , because i get them more wired , " @entity5 says			1
" but after all , i did write ' @entity214			0
' we may as well dance			0

at 63 , rocker @entity5 is still playing music , with no plans to stop
@entity5 : " in order to maintain that intensity , i have to get away from it " -- by hunting
between tours , *charity* and speaking events , he relaxes at homes in @entity1 and @entity97
among his regrets : he did n't go to his mom 's funeral
