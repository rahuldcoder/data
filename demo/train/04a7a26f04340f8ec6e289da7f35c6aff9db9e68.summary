-- in the last 2,000 years , commodity shortages , financial speculation , wars , famines , and outright manias have created some pretty strange economic behavior throughout the world			1
once worthless @entity9 coins found in the @entity11 town of @entity12 are considered quite a treasure			1
cake or death ? in order to stop rising inflation and devaluation of the currency in third century @entity21 , @entity16 instituted fixed prices on most consumer goods			1
anyone selling goods at prices higher than those of the emperor was put to death ; this led to hoarding of goods			1
a law was then passed that forbade the hoarding of goods			1
so people just closed their businesses , then another law was passed			2
you guessed it : shut down your business or fail to follow in your father 's business ? @entity36			1
it 's amazing the @entity46 lasted as long as it did			1
@entity0 : strange things we did n't know were illegal gon na barter like it 's @entity50 99 when the @entity46 collapsed in the 5th century , so did the @entity9 financial system			1
part of the collapse was the disappearance of roman coinage			2
nowhere was this more evident than in @entity58 , where , according to archeological evidence , money basically disappeared , driving the @entity11 isles straight back to a barter economy			2
coinage only came back centuries later when the @entity58 were forced to pay protection money ( @entity65 ) to the @entity66 to stop the constant pillaging			2
99.9 percent pure in 15th century @entity68 , grain shortages -- acceptable -- frequently led to beer shortages -- unacceptable			1
in response , brewers in towns like @entity73 and @entity74 used seeds , spices , and rushes to flavor their beers			2
showing an uncomfortable foreshadowing of future events , @entity68 authorities instituted purity laws stating that only water , barley , and hops could be used in the brewing of beer			2
the rule , or @entity91 , is still on the books today			0
nothing but the best for @entity95 while the @entity98 , @entity98 , and his building of @entity100 typically get all the credit for bankrupting @entity95 in the seventeenth century , his minister of finance , @entity96 deserves some kudos as well			0
@entity96 's tax schemes , deficit spending , and manic obsession with the production of luxury goods -- to the detriment , or outright exclusion of ordinary consumer goods -- emptied the @entity95 treasuries , drove the peasantry to starvation , and laid the foundation for the bloodiest revolution of the age			1
but , let 's face it : who would n't trade the fate of an entire nation for a really , really well made tapestry ? adjustable rate mortgage , archduke @entity124 ? in the 1860s , the rulers of the newly - formed @entity126 encouraged their bankers to be more free with their lending standards			1
their goal was to encourage growth in the empire			0
the result ( this is going to sound eerily familiar ) was over-speculation in building , massive default on borrowed funds , and economic collapse throughout @entity140			1
the worldwide depression reached all the way to the @entity143 and triggered the panic of 1873			1
on the bright side , many of the most beautiful buildings in @entity140 come from this period of " irrational exuberance			1
" @entity151 burning @entity152 , a @entity153 banker and businessman , took control of a @entity95 enterprise called the @entity157 in 1717			0
in just a few years , he turned the company into the main economic force behind the @entity95 colonies throughout the world			0
the share price for the company went from about 500 livres in 1719 to 10,000 livres in 1720			0
just one year later though , in a rather @entity168 - like turnaround , the stock price collapsed , @entity152 fled @entity95 , and the @entity95 government ( as the primary shareholder ) was forced to cancel a significant portion of its debt obligations leaving lenders throughout the world ruined			0
economists refer to the episode as the " @entity157			0
" the @entity178 bottom line many have read about the effects of hyperinflation on the @entity68 @entity182			0
from 1920 - 1923 , prices in @entity68 increased as much as 3.25 million percent			2
people burned their old currency for warmth , since it was less costly than buying wood			0
but , few know that the same type of hyperinflation , albeit to a lesser extent , affected the @entity192			0
from 1861 to 1864 , the commodity price index rose as high as 10 percent a month			0
by the end of the @entity197 , the cost of living in dear old @entity195 was 92 percent higher than before the war			0
@entity0 : the @entity192 's plan to conquer @entity200 prayer pays in 1943 , due to shortage of raw materials like paper and leather , and an increase in wartime piety , there was an actual @entity210 shortage in the @entity143			1
@entity211 falling @entity212 had one of the most meteoric economic rises of the twentieth century			0
by the late ' 80s , property values had risen so high that all the land in @entity212 was worth four times the value of all the property in the @entity143			1
the real estate value of @entity211 alone was valued at more than that of all @entity200			0
by the end of the century , however , the @entity211 stock exchange was off 60 percent of its 1989 high , and property values had fallen as much as 80 percent			0
