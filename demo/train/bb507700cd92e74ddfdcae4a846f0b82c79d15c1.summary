@entity0 -- the @entity3 is cresting at @entity0 , forecasters said tuesday , as attention began turning to flooding concerns in @entity6 and @entity3			1
the slow passing of the bulge of water working its way from north to south along the @entity3 is only the beginning of the end of the siege for @entity0 residents , who could be dealing with high water levels into june			1
and the struggle is just getting started for residents of @entity3 and @entity6 , where the river is expected to rise over the next few days to levels unseen since 1927			1
@entity6 gov. @entity20 predicted tuesday that as many as 3 million acres of his state could be affected by the flooding			1
as has been the case upriver from @entity25 south to @entity26 , the @entity23 is predicting its system of levees and flood walls will hold , keeping the river from inundating the small towns and farms that line its banks			2
" the system is under stress			2
it has been under significant stress all along			0
however , it is operating as designed and intended , " said @entity38 chief @entity37			0
" the time of greatest concern has passed			0
we 're in a stable situation , " he said about the area around @entity0			1
in @entity47 , @entity3 , where the river was inching toward a 48 - foot crest tuesday evening , county spokesman @entity46 said there 's not much anyone can do			1
" we 're just watching and waiting , " he said			0
about 600 people in the @entity47 community of @entity54 have been driven from their homes , @entity46 said			0
some of the city 's casinos also have water in them , but no one is sure how much , he said			0
downstream in @entity6 , the @entity23 said it was closing a major lock that allows for the transfer of barge traffic between the @entity3 and the @entity65			1
@entity66 also opened 44 more gates to the @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity6 , on tuesday , sending millions of gallons of water rushing into @entity72 and , eventually , the @entity73			1
the @entity23 opened 28 gates on monday and may consider opening an additional 38 on wednesday , according to @entity76 president @entity75			0
the spillway was diverting the equivalent of nearly 50 @entity80 - sized swimming pools from the @entity3 each minute , according to @entity23 statistics			1
the agency is also considering opening a second spillway -- the @entity84 -- that could flood populated areas			0
the wait for whatever is going to happen is causing anxiety among residents			0
they 've been posting on @entity92 pages operated by the @entity23 , demanding answers about if and when the @entity84 will be opened and what other areas might be flooded			0
the spillway is on the @entity3 north of @entity96			1
opening that spillway would send water into the @entity99 to the west and south of @entity96			0
a decision about whether to open the spillway is expected within the next 48 hours , according to col. @entity104 , commander of the @entity105			2
if that second spillway is opened , @entity20 predicted that roughly 2,500 people and 2,000 structures would be at risk directly inside the floodway			1
another 22,500 people and 11,000 structures would be affected by backwater flooding , he said			1
the river in @entity0 measured 47.81 feet as of 1 p.m. tuesday , according to the @entity115 , which had not yet reported an official crest			1
water levels could fall or rise slightly , said @entity1 meteorologist @entity118			0
" this is a long process that has small peaks and valleys , " she said			0
a crest is defined as the high point of the water during a flood before it begins to recede			2
observers generally know that cresting is occurring when the gradual rise stops and the water level becomes stable			0
the @entity3 is the highest it 's been at @entity0 since 1937 , when it crested at 48.7 feet -- 14.7 feet above flood stage			1
that flood killed 500 people and inundated 20 million acres of land , said col. @entity135 , the @entity137 commander			1
so far , the levees protecting the area have only shown minor weaknesses , which workers have been able to control , he said			0
the river covered the lowest parts of the city 's historic @entity145 and had already forced about 400 people from their homes monday , @entity0 mayor @entity142 said			1
another 1,300 remained in low - lying areas , he said			0
one of the @entity0 residents in peril was @entity152			1
her neighborhood had been swallowed by floodwaters but so far , her home was the last one at the waters ' edge			2
" it wants to come up here , but i 've been praying every day it do n't , " @entity158 told @entity1 affiliate @entity160 monday			0
" i got three kids , and i 'm not ready to move out of my house over this			0
" president @entity166 signed disaster declarations for @entity26 on monday and tuesday , which will help direct federal aid toward recovery efforts in areas hit by severe storms , flooding and tornadoes since april and continuing			2
although the river was cresting , @entity135 warned @entity0 residents not to assume everything will soon return to normal			1
" the flooding is going to stay , " he said			2
" this river is not going to drop below 47 ( feet ) until early next week at the earliest			2
and that means all the tributaries that flow into this are going to stay high			0
" flooded areas in @entity26 could turn into ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes , which can transmit @entity185 virus and other diseases , the @entity26 @entity180 warned			0
the @entity187 @entity180 said people in flooded areas could be at greater risk for tetanus			0
once past @entity26 , the crest will next target @entity6 and @entity3 , where residents and authorities continued preparations for river levels that could break records set in 1927 , when flooding displaced 600,000 people and caused the equivalent of nearly $ 624 million in damages , according to the @entity115			1
forecasters do n't expect anywhere near that kind of flooding , in large part because of the network of levees built after that disaster			2
some 500 @entity210 members have been mobilized for the flooding event so far , @entity20 said			1
the river 's crest was expected to begin arriving in @entity6 next week			1
so far , 21 parishes have issued emergency declarations , @entity20 said			1
flooding is the last thing needed in southern @entity6 , which is still recovering from @entity218 , said @entity219 , a @entity220 resident who submitted footage of the flooding to @entity223			1
" i went through @entity218 , " @entity219 said			0
" i would not wish flooding on anyone , and this city is the last place on @entity227 that needs any more high water			2
" @entity230 sen. @entity229 , @entity6 , echoed that thought			1
" after hurricanes @entity218 , @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 -- as well as the oil spill -- @entity6 can ill - afford another large - scale disaster			2
billions of dollars in property is at stake , not to mention the threat to human life , " she said			0
flooding also continued to be a problem in southeastern @entity25 and southern @entity244 , even though the @entity3 and @entity246 rivers have already crested in those states			1
last week , the @entity23 intentionally breached a levee in @entity25 as part of its effort to reduce the pressure on other levees , flooding 130,000 acres of agricultural land over the objection of state officials and some farmers			2
the latest flooding in the @entity3 and @entity246 river valleys is largely the byproduct of torrential rains throughout the region			1
over one two - week stretch , there was about 600 % more precipitation than usual , forecasters said			0
current weather finally appears to be working in the flood fighters ' favor			0
only minimal rain is expected over the coming days , with daytime temperatures forecast to be in the upper 80s and 90s through thursday			2
@entity1 's @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 and @entity274 contributed to this report .			0
