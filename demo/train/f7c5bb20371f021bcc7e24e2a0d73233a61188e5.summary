@entity13 , @entity14 : you 're locked in for 10 minutes of commercial - free news headlines ! my name is @entity19 , it is tuesday , april 5th and @entity0 is up and running			1
first up : change in plan @entity21 : the @entity22 announced yesterday afternoon , that five suspected 9/11 terrorists will get military trials at the @entity26 detention center in @entity27 , @entity28			1
here 's why that 's significant : before he won the 2008 election , candidate @entity29 promised he 'd close the prison at @entity27			1
and his @entity34 said the terrorism suspects would be tried in civilian courts -- not by military tribunals			1
most @entity26 did n't want those suspects tried in civilian courts			1
when attorney general @entity41 announced the trials at @entity27 , he criticized @entity43 for restricting the @entity34 's ability to prosecute the five suspects			1
@entity46 @entity21 : hundreds of flights aboard @entity48 have been canceled over the past few days			2
it 's because one of its @entity52 passenger jets had a problem on friday : this			1
a hole measuring five feet long and one foot wide			2
it opened up over passengers ' heads on a flight from @entity60 , @entity61 to @entity62 , @entity63			2
the pilots made an emergency landing in @entity66 , @entity61 , and no one was seriously injured			2
@entity48 grounded 79 of its planes to check them out afterward			2
the model with the problem is an older one			2
one that 's not made anymore			1
@entity48 found indications of cracks in three other aircraft while dozens of others have been inspected and returned to the flight line			2
@entity79 mystery @entity21 : it 's not known exactly what caused the crash of an @entity79 jet two years ago , though			1
@entity84 was traveling from @entity85 to @entity86 , @entity87 , when it went down in the southern @entity89 ocean			2
that was on june first , 2009			2
and until recently , large parts of the plane had not been found			2
on monday , though , a @entity95 government minister said search teams located this : what 's believed to be the wreckage of the @entity101 330 plane			1
the 228 people aboard were killed in the crash			2
and even if the flight data recorder is located , it 's possible it wo n't be working anymore because of corrosion and water pressure			1
this area of the @entity89 typically has rough and quickly changing weather			0
@entity111 @entity21 : this is a shot of radioactive water leaking from one of @entity4 's damaged nuclear reactors			1
it 's spilling into the @entity117			1
@entity4 workers have tried a couple different methods to stop this leak ; nothing has worked yet			1
but because so much water has been used to prevent a nuclear meltdown , @entity4 officials say they have no choice but to intentionally dump millions of gallons , into the sea			1
they 're hoping a planned silt fence will keep radioactive material from spreading into the ocean			0
this is just one of the major problems caused by @entity4 's march 11th earthquake and tsunami -- it killed more than 12,000 people ; more than 15,000 are still missing			1
and @entity137 explains how concerns about nuclear contamination are reaching far beyond @entity4			1
( begin video ) @entity141 , @entity142 correspondent : what does this toy monkey have to do with the crisis of the @entity147 nuclear plant ? nothing			0
but @entity149 is still scanning with a @entity151 counter			0
@entity152 , @entity153 : it 's 0.13 microsievert			1
@entity155 : all of his toys and gadgets at @entity4 trend shop.com			1
there 's a notice on his company 's home page to his international customers stating the nuclear crisis has no connection to his exports			1
@entity170 : people just scared			0
so we just want to prove to everybody and show you do n't need to be scared			0
@entity155 : but many are afraid			0
as news reports show countries like @entity180 testing @entity4 food exports			1
@entity182 , screening passengers from @entity4 for radiation			1
in the @entity26 , inspectors have picked up traces of radiation from the @entity147 plant on both coasts , including milk in @entity191			1
none have found dangerous levels of radiation but the headlines add up to a fear of products dubbed made in @entity4			1
public sentiment does have a real impact on the economy			0
@entity4 watchers say in this case , it 's an impact that will be felt for some time to come			1
@entity204 , advisor to japanese government : this is going to be a measurable impact			0
and some industries and some companies will not survive			0
@entity155 : @entity211 is an advisor to @entity4 's government on the economic fallout of the @entity147 and tsunami crises			1
@entity211 believes high - tech , nameless parts to go into vehicles and popular electronics , wo n't be impacted due to radiation fears			0
but given a choice between a brand dubbed made in @entity4 versus another country , consumers will not choose @entity4			1
@entity225 : i think that consumer sentiment and going forward , things like this , once they make the decision			0
it 's hard to change , at least for a generation			1
and this will affect buying habits			0
@entity155 : @entity149 has this plea to global consumers			0
@entity170 : continue buying stuff			0
this is what helps us in @entity4			1
it does n't help us if everyone stops buying and panicking now , for no reason			0
just makes the economy worse and does n't help anything			0
