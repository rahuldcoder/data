@entity2 @entity1 correspondent @entity0 and photojournalist @entity3 traveled to southern @entity4 with gen. @entity5 , commandant of the @entity6			1
@entity2 's @entity0 is on assignment in @entity4 , where she says @entity6 are living in very tough terrain			1
@entity9 , @entity4 ( @entity2 ) -- our travels in @entity4 continue			1
i feel like the title of this posting should be " why i had to get power - washed in @entity4 " or " the body armor is only heavy until they start shooting at you			1
" ok , now i will explain			0
@entity2 photojournalist @entity3 and i just wrapped up spending several days in southern @entity4 with gen. @entity5 , commandant of the @entity6 , touring the combat zone			1
the @entity6 are living in some of the toughest terrain there is			2
it is remote and often raining			0
that means dust turns to mud , and you find yourself covered in it from head to toe			0
stinky , cold , wet , oozy mucky mud			0
the good news is , everybody stinks , so you lose any sense of self - consciousness about it			2
but you do dream of getting power - washed			0
so , yes , after a few days a shower was , shall we say , more than essential			0
for the @entity6 , however , it is a seven - month tour of duty in mud in the winter and dust in the summer			1
it seems very grim , especially when compounded by the fact that the @entity6 are wearing heavy body armor all the time			1
ask them if it 's heavy to wear , the typical answer goes something like , " it 's only heavy to wear until the bad guys start shooting at you			1
" the young @entity6 know exactly how tough the fight they are facing in the coming weeks and months will likely be			2
several of them told me security had gotten considerably worse in recent days			0
their bases were being repeatedly shelled by insurgents , several roadside bombs had gone off , and local @entity4 police had died at the hands of suicide attacks			2
senior commanders usually have a more cheery outlook , but here in southern @entity4 , everyone is cautious			1
almost everyone is a veteran of @entity71 and learned the tough lesson there about not declaring victory too soon			0
even @entity5 , who commanded @entity76 forces in @entity77 , picks his words very carefully			0
he tells me he believes that everyone must be ready for a spike in @entity76 casualties as the @entity6 begin to move into the region in greater numbers this spring			2
all of this was rattling around in my head when i saw the @entity6 riding around in what they call " a 7 - ton truck			1
" as the name suggests , it 's huge and has some armor plating on the sides			1
but what it does n't make clear is that the truck is open in the back and sides			1
the @entity6 insist it is a safe way to transport troops			2
for years now , the @entity98 has used fully armored vehicles only in the combat zone			0
the @entity6 have a somewhat different view			2
they believe heavy armor is n't everything ; sometimes being able to get around on the battlefield faster is better			0
but then again , when someone starts shooting at you , i think you want all the armor you can get			0
yeah , there is still a war there , too .			0

with all the mud in southern @entity4 , everyone stinks , @entity0 says
@entity6 also wear heavy body armor all the time , adding to the *discomfort*
armor is only heavy " until the bad guys start shooting at you , " @entity6 say
@entity6 often travel in " 7 - ton truck " that 's open in the back and sides
