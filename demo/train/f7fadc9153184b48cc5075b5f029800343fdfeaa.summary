-- millions of people are suffering in the drought - ravaged @entity2 , but help is on the way thanks to relief groups from around the world			1
one of them , @entity8 , is focused on the youngest victims of the crisis			1
founded by @entity8 , a 2010 @entity11 , the organization is providing food to 24,000 children a day in northern @entity15			1
@entity16 - @entity8 recently spoke to @entity0 's @entity17 about his organization 's efforts			1
@entity17 : your group was already working in the region before this crisis unfolded			2
how have you seen the situation evolve ? @entity8 : we 've been working in northern @entity15 for about four years now			1
we 've been feeding several thousand children in nursery schools			2
over the last two or three years , we 've seen the situation ... worsen steadily because of the lack of rains			2
it 's become harder and harder for parents there to feed their children			2
most of their animals , which they depend completely on , have now died			0
we have a real crisis , a real situation of life and death facing those people and children			1
because of that , we are trying desperately to expand our program to reach more children at risk , and we will do that as funds allow us to			0
we 've already grown the program to reach a further 6,000 children every day during this period			1
and we will stay committed to feeding those children as long as this current crisis remains			1
we are all hoping desperately the rains will come in october , but there is no guarantee of that			0
@entity17 : how has the drought impacted people there , beyond the need for food and water ? @entity8 : the plight of the people is just desperate			1
some of the mothers of the children we fed in @entity71 , recently ... crossed over the border into @entity73 to barter the beautiful necklaces that they make			0
... on their way back from doing that , having got food for their children , they were ambushed by a neighboring tribe with which they 'd been in conflict for many years			2
around 40 or 50 women lost their lives			0
@entity17 : as someone who works every day to save impoverished children , how does a situation like this make you feel ? @entity8 : the pictures that we see on television of the suffering in the @entity2 , it just fills you with horror and shame really that that 's happening today : in our world of plenty , our children are still starving to death			1
and , i 'm sure like so many people , my desire is just to do something about that -- to do whatever we can do to save the lives of those children			1
and , at the same time , to build something better and help those communities escape from reliance on aid and escape from these situations in the future			0
@entity17 : what changes have you seen for @entity8 since you were recognized at " @entity11 : an all - star tribute " last year ? @entity8 : many new people have made contact with us from all over the world , wanting to be part of @entity8 , wanting to help us provide daily meals for children in schools			1
that 's resulted in lots more support and ultimately allowed us to feed many more of the world 's hungriest children			0
i think at the time of the show last year , we were feeding around 460,000 every day			0
that figure now has risen to around 560,000 ... ( in ) places like @entity137 and @entity138 and @entity139			0
we are now providing meals in @entity141 also			0
the whole focus and mission of @entity8 is about meeting the immediate needs of the hungry child by providing them a meal in a place of education -- so that we draw them into our schools or nurseries in the belief that education can be their ladder out of poverty			1
on average , we can feed a child for an entire school year for $ 15			0
in ( @entity137 and @entity138 ) , we are rolling out a program in primary schools to reach hundreds of thousands more children			0
and it 's wonderful to watch in both those countries how many children are coming to school for the first time because of those daily meals			0
