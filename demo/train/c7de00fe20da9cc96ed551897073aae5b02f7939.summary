@entity0 -- the @entity2 narrowly ruled wednesday that a white cross , erected as a war memorial and sitting on national parkland in the @entity6 , does not violate the constitutional separation of church and state			1
the 5 - 4 conservative majority said @entity9 acted properly when it tried to transfer land around the @entity11 to veterans groups , an effort to eliminate any @entity15 violation			1
the land then would have been declared a national memorial			2
a federal appeals panel had blocked that land swap			0
" it is reasonable to interpret the congressional designation as giving recognition to the historical meaning that the cross had attained , " justice @entity20 wrote			2
" the @entity26 does not oblige government to avoid any public acknowledgment of religion 's role in society			2
" but even among the conservatives who voted to allow the cross to stand , there was strong disagreement about how similar disputes should be settled , an indication of the contentious nature of church - and - state cases			2
at issue before the justices was whether the display violates the @entity43 , which says that " @entity9 shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion			2
" more specifically , can one individual who protests the cross have legal standing to take his case to court and prevail ? and do congressional efforts to minimize the appearance of a constitutional violation carry any weight ? the 6 - foot latin cross was first erected in 1934 by a local @entity58 unit in a remote part of the @entity61 desert to honor war dead			1
it has been rebuilt several times over the years , and @entity65 services take place on the site annually			0
the land now is part of the @entity70 , a unit of the @entity72 , encompassing 1.6 million acres , or 2,500 square miles			0
a former @entity72 employee brought suit , saying such symbols represent government endorsement of the @entity78 faith			0
a federal appeals court ultimately agreed , and rejected a move by @entity9 in 2003 to transfer the tiny portion of land where the cross sits back to the @entity58 , as a privately held national memorial			1
the area in question is a prominent outcropping known as @entity88			0
@entity20 said the cross represents more than just a religion , echoing the views of the @entity58			0
" here one @entity93 cross in the desert evokes far more than religion , " he wrote			2
" it evokes thousands of small crosses in foreign fields marking the graves of @entity100 who fell in battles , battles whose tragedies are compounded if the fallen are forgotten			0
" the court sent the case back to the lower federal courts to resolve , and said the man who brought the suit , @entity110 , could continue his legal fight over how the future land transfer is handled			1
justices @entity113 and @entity115 said they would go further and end all litigation of the land transfer			1
the appeals court noted that the land transfer effort singled out the vfw for special treatment and that officials had rejected a proposal to erect a nearby @entity123 stupa , or shrine			1
jewish and @entity127 veterans groups in the @entity100 say the @entity11 symbolizes the sacrifice of @entity78 veterans , excluding other faiths			1
in dissent , justice @entity131 -- who is retiring at the end of the term in june -- said the land transfer does not remedy the constitutional concerns			1
" such measures would not completely end the government endorsement of this cross , " he wrote , " as the land would have been transferred in a manner favoring the cross and the cross would remain designated as a national memorial			1
" as the only war veteran on the court , @entity131 , who served in @entity145 as an intelligence officer , added , " i certainly agree that the nation should memorialize the service of those who fought and died in @entity152 , but it can not lawfully do so by continued endorsement of a starkly sectarian message			0
" the @entity155 is representing @entity110			0
attorney @entity156 told the court " the government had favored one party to come on , contrary to the government 's own regulations , and erect a permanent symbol , while not allowing others			0
" the case is @entity165 ( 08 - 472 ) .			0

justices say war memorial does **n't** violate @entity26 's @entity43
@entity11 was placed on national parkland in @entity61 desert
5 - 4 majority says transfer of land around cross to veterans groups was proper
in dissent , justice says land transfer does **n't** remedy constitutional concerns
