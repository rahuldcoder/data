-- here 's something shocking			0
democrats and @entity3 totally disagree about the significance of the @entity3 's victory in the first major competitive congressional ballot box test of 2014			1
@entity3 candidate @entity7 narrowly edged out democrat @entity8 to win tuesday 's special election in @entity11 's 13th @entity10			1
@entity7 will fill out the term of his former boss , longtime @entity13 rep. @entity13 , who died in october			2
@entity3 win first election showdown of the year the race was consistently in the spotlight with national republicans framing the election as a referendum on @entity20			1
they injected a massive infusion of outside ad money into the race and some pundits cast the election as a possible bellwether for november 's midterms			1
" i think this was a referendum on ( president @entity33 's ) policies and on @entity20 , that played out significantly to the disadvantage of ( @entity35 ) @entity36			2
and i think it sets the tone for what 's coming in the fall , " rep. @entity37 of @entity38 , the chairman of the @entity40 , told @entity0 wednesday			0
" we 've been trying to tell people this is a referendum election , @entity20 is not helping people the way it was promised , and @entity2 are going to have a lot of answering to do , " @entity37 added			1
but his counterpart at the @entity51 sees very little predictive value in the results			0
" special elections are not indicators of the future			0
and certainly this is not an indicator of the future , " rep. @entity59 , the @entity51 chairman , told reporters			0
special coverage : 2014 midterm elections while a contest this far out from @entity70 rarely offers a preview of what will actually happen in november , @entity67 's victory gives the @entity3 instant bragging rights			1
and the results also illustrate a few things about how the midterm election season may play out			0
@entity3 's convinced @entity20 's bad medicine for @entity2 : while the candidates and local matters weighed heavily in the race , @entity20 was also a key issue			1
and @entity7 's victory will only embolden @entity3 attempts top repeal the @entity20			1
" his ( @entity7 's ) victory shows that voters are looking for representatives who will fight to end the disaster of @entity20 , " @entity83 chairman @entity82 and co-chair @entity84 said in an email blast to reporters			1
many of the ads attacking @entity8 focused on health care			2
a disaster for families and seniors			0
for @entity8 , the priority is @entity20			1
not us , " said the narrator in a tv commercial by the @entity106 , which backed @entity67			2
that was a potent message in a district that 's one of the grayest in the nation			0
nearly a quarter of all residents in @entity11 - 13 are 65 or older			0
@entity7 said he was committed to getting rid of @entity20 entirely			1
@entity8 recognized that @entity20 was a major issue			1
while she highlighted how the @entity20 has helped people , she also noted that the law has flaws and said she was open to @entity3 proposals to amend some of the measure 's requirements			1
the @entity120 claimed the issue of health care actually kept the contest close			0
the most important poll number of 2014 " republicans fell short of their normal margin in this district because the agenda they are offering voters has a singular focus - that a majority of voters oppose - repealing the @entity20 that would return us to the same old broken health care system , " said rep. @entity125 of @entity11 , the @entity120 chair			2
@entity51 pollster @entity136 told reporters that " based on polling we did up until the election , @entity8 basically neutralized the issue of the @entity20			1
" but @entity136 noted that @entity20 energized the @entity3 electorate			1
" we have to acknowledge that the @entity20 was a motivating issue for republicans to come out and vote , and less so for @entity2 , " he said			2
last autumn 's flawed rollout of the health care law and the controversy over canceled policies because of @entity20 played into @entity3 hands			1
and the president 's inaccurate pledge that " if you like your insurance , you can keep it " under the new health care law is a line that dominated @entity3 attack ads the past few months			2
even before tuesday 's @entity3 victory , @entity3 pledged to keep the campaign focus on the health care law , even if it starts to gain traction with the public			2
a number of @entity3 strategists @entity0 reached out to on wednesday said that while the focus wo n't be 100 % on @entity20 , they admit it will remain a huge part of how they frame the midterms			1
republicans hit @entity170 over climate change all - nighter " the one thing @entity3 will take away from this race is that the @entity20 assault worked			1
we 're going to see more and more and more , " said @entity0 chief national correspondent @entity175			0
" regardless of whether or not the election will tell us anything about november , the two political parties will learn lessons from this contest and apply them to future races , " said @entity177 , editor of the nonpartisan @entity177			0
" @entity67 's win means it 's all about @entity20 for the @entity3			1
" outside money really mattered : in @entity8 , national @entity2 landed the high - profile and well - known candidate they wanted in this race , and she faced nominal opposition in january 's @entity51 primary			1
@entity7 was far from the @entity3 's dream candidate , and he had to battle to win his party 's nomination			1
the past two months , he faced a barrage of attacks by @entity2 on his days as a lobbyist and his work for groups pushing to privatize @entity199			0
@entity8 , meanwhile , greatly out - raised , and outspent @entity7			1
but support from outside groups gave @entity7 a major boost			2
since it 's one of a dwindling number of competitive districts and since it was the only game in town , outside money poured into the race			2
it was the most expensive contest so far this cycle , topping even last year 's special @entity212 election in @entity213			2
in addition to the approximate $ 2.5 million spent by the two campaigns , the party committees and outside groups dished out more than $ 9 million to run tv and radio ads , other paid media and direct mail , according to the @entity222 , which monitors outside spending			0
the pro-republican group @entity224 , which said it spent $ 500,000 on the contest , said that @entity11 - 13 was just an appetizer " a lot of us rolled up our sleeves after 2012 , studied the @entity33 playbook and invested in targeted voter turnout and more effective messaging			0
the @entity11 cd - 13 special was an important test market and there was unprecedented cooperation among outside groups			2
we intend to keep refining these lessons as we prepare for the fall elections , " said @entity224 ceo @entity237			0
turnout mattered : @entity11 - 13 , which is a swing district in a swing state , covers most of @entity242 between @entity243 and the @entity244 , including parts of @entity246			0
while @entity13 captured 58 % of the vote in his 2012 re-election , president @entity33 narrowly carried the district in his 2008 and 2012 victories			0
so what happened tuesday ? jolly won by around 3,500 votes out of some 180,000 cast			0
a libertarian candidate grabbed just under 5 % of the vote			0
the plain and simple truth is that @entity8 lost because @entity51 voters did n't vote			2
turnout in the 2012 election was nearly double what it was in the special election			1
@entity51 officials wednesday said by their calculations , the @entity3 had a plus - 13 advantage in the voting electorate in tuesday 's special election , compared to a plus - five advantage for the @entity3 in the district in 2012			1
" the reality is @entity8 was able to narrow a very large @entity3 advantage in turnout			1
she did very well with independent voters , " said @entity136			0
and @entity274 vowed to win the district come november , when he says the electorate will be more slightly more favorable to the @entity2			0
" if this election were in november instead of march , i think @entity8 would have won , " @entity274 added			2
a veteran @entity51 strategist says his party has some hard work ahead			0
" while it is true that a special election often has lower turnout ( and thus is more likely to be won by a @entity3 ) , i think @entity2 spin this loss at their own peril			1
we lost , period , " said @entity0 contributor @entity288			0
" it means we have to redouble our efforts to register and turn out the rising @entity295 electorate : people of color , unmarried women , young people			0
we will never be able to match the right wing dollar - for - dollar , so we have to beat them voter - to - voter , " he said			0
steep road got steeper : the @entity2 odds of winning back the @entity305 in november just got a little bit slimmer			0
with @entity7 's win keeping the congressional seat in @entity3 hands , the @entity2 still need win 17 seats in the midterms to regain control of the chamber			1
political handicappers consider that a tall order , considering the shrinking number of competitive congressional districts nationwide .			0
