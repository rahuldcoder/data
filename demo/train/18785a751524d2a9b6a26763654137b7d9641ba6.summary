@entity0 -- an e-mail discussion about talking points the @entity4 administration used to describe the deadly attack on the @entity7 compound in @entity8 , @entity9 , show the @entity10 and @entity11 were more involved than they first said in the decision to remove an initial @entity14 assessment that a group with ties to @entity17 was involved , according to @entity1 sources with knowledge of the e-mails			1
after hearing , @entity21 say there 's more to story doomed ambassador : ' we 're under attack ' the unclassified talking points have become a political flashpoint in a long - running battle between the administration and @entity21 , who say that officials knew the attack last september 11 was a planned terror operation while they were telling the public it was an act of violence that grew out of a demonstration over a video produced in the @entity7 that insulted @entity40			1
@entity41 : @entity8 investigation both legitimate and partisan that was the story that @entity7 ambassador to the @entity47 @entity46 told five days later when she made the rounds of all five sunday morning television talk shows			2
@entity4 administration officials have long said that @entity51 was using official talking points that were edited almost exclusively by the intelligence community			1
the attack also occurred two months before the november election , in which president @entity4 's campaign often pointed out that it had " decimated " @entity17			2
@entity57 : @entity4 has explaining to do on @entity8 @entity10 spokesman @entity58 on friday called the controversy a " distraction " from the facts and said the administration had raised the possibility of extremist involvement from the start			1
he told reporters the administration was careful with information on @entity8 and was open with the public once facts were established			2
an interagency discussion over the talking points to describe the attack just days previous that killed ambassador @entity74 and three other @entity7 included the @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity14 , @entity75 and @entity77 officials			1
a senior administration official told @entity1 that the e-mails were made available to @entity80 earlier this year and nothing contradicts what it has said			0
" the @entity10 made stylistic edits to the talking points to emphasize that the investigation was ongoing as to who was responsible " and to simplify certain phrasing , the official said			1
@entity58 added that the only edit made by the @entity10 or the @entity11 was to change the description of the targeted facility to a diplomatic post from consulate			0
the e-mail exchange and alterations to the talking points were first reported by @entity97 and @entity98 and confirmed by @entity1 appear to contradict that assertion			1
a source familiar with the matter said then - @entity11 spokeswoman @entity102 raised concerns over the @entity14 's first version of the talking points , saying that they went further than what she was allowed to say about the attack during her briefings and that she believed the @entity14 was attempting to exonerate itself at the @entity11 's expense by suggesting @entity14 warnings about the security situation were ignored			1
@entity58 said on friday there was a " deliberative process " around the talking points involving several agencies			2
he said the talking points reflected the best assessment of the intelligence community at the time of what occurred in @entity8 , and said there has been an effort since to politicize the tragedy			2
" this is an effort to accuse the administration of hiding something we did not hide , " he said			0
the @entity14 had no comment on the matter			0
according to a congressional source with knowledge of the e-mails , the @entity14 's first draft of the talking points was sent to other agencies on the afternoon of friday , september 14			1
they were requested by rep. @entity138 during a classified briefing by then - @entity14 director @entity140 and were intended to be used by members of @entity80 and administration officials			0
according to @entity144 and @entity98 , the first draft included a line that said " @entity40 extremists with ties to @entity17 participated in the attack			2
" the first version also includes a reference to the terrorist organization @entity151 -- an @entity17 - affiliated group that operates in @entity9 that took credit for the attack on @entity155 but later denied any involvement			1
also in the initial talking points was an acknowledgement that the @entity14 had produced " numerous pieces on the threat of extremists linked to @entity17 in @entity8 and eastern @entity9			1
" the reference also mentioned that " at least five other attacks against foreign interests " had been made since april 2012 , according to the news organizations			0
in response to the initial assessment , @entity102 on friday e-mails a group involved in an interagency process of reviewing the talking points and brought up a number of concerns , according to congressional source			2
" now i understand that these are for members of @entity80			0
i have serious concerns about all the parts highlighted below , " she wrote			0
" why are we arming members of @entity80 to start making the assertion to the media that we ourselves are not making because we do n't want to prejudice the investigation			0
why do we want @entity185 to be fingering @entity151 when we are n't doing that ourselves			0
" she continued , " the penultimate point " -- information about the @entity14 receiving numerous threats from extremists groups -- could be abused by members to beat the @entity11 for not paying attention to state department warnings so why do we want to cede that either ...			2
" an @entity196 staffer replied that the " @entity75 did not have major concern with the points and only offered a couple of minor points			0
" after @entity102 weighed in , the reference to @entity151 was scrubbed from the account			0
@entity102 responds at 9:24 p.m. on friday , writing , " these do n't resolve all of my issues or those of my building 's leadership			0
" just a minute after @entity102 's e-mail , @entity210 , then a policy adviser for then - secretary of state @entity212 , writes the group			0
" i spoke with @entity215 , " @entity210 writes , referring to then - @entity196 spokesman @entity214			0
" we 'll work this through in the morning			0
" @entity21 spotlight shifts from @entity4 to @entity220 opinion : hearing 's aim was to undermine @entity220 less than 10 minutes later , deputy national security council adviser @entity224 e-mailed the group stating that he did n't want anything in the talking points that would undermine the investigation and directs the matter to a saturday meeting at the @entity10			1
according to multiple sources , the interagency group met saturday morning , and according to a congressional source , the paragraph acknowledging that the @entity14 had warned about " the threat of extremists linked to @entity17 and @entity8 " in preceding months was removed from the talking points after that meeting			1
after the saturday meeting , a separate e-mail was directed to @entity51 , telling her that the first draft of the talking points seemed unsuitable based on the discussion at the @entity10 meeting , the unknown author of the e-mail wrote , " because they implied the @entity14 warned about a specific attack			1
" the e-mail continues : " i spoke with @entity210 immediately after the ( the @entity10 meeting ) and noted that you are doing the sunday morning shows and need to be aware of the final posture that these points took			2
" what the @entity4 administration has said about the @entity8 attack by the @entity259 : @entity7 diplomatic presence a @entity7 intelligence official would not discuss the specific changes that were made in the talking points , but reiterated the previous reasons given for why they were made			1
" there were several valid intelligence and investigatory reasons why they were changed : the information about individuals linked to @entity17 was derived from classified sources , and could not be corroborated at the unclassified level ; the links were tenuous and therefore it made sense to be cautious before naming perpetrators ; finally , no one wanted to prejudice a criminal investigation in its earliest stages			0
" a senior @entity7 intelligence official would also not comment on what the @entity11 may have recommended as part of the interagency review process , but did say it would be a " significant stretch " to suggest " the @entity11 made a comment therefore the talking points changed			1
" the official also maintained nothing has changed since last november when @entity289 , the spokesman for the office of the director of national intelligence said " there were no substantive changes made to the talking points after they left the intelligence community			1
" @entity1 's @entity296 and @entity297 contributed to this report .			0

talking points used to underpin early explanation of events surrounding attack
references to @entity14 security warnings , possible @entity17 involvement removed
