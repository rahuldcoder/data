a peace agreement that had halted violence in the former @entity3 republic of @entity4 was shattered wednesday when a rebel commander who had given up his weapons was killed by government forces , neighbors and relatives said			1
the incident occurred in the southeastern province of @entity12 at 4 a.m. , when government soldiers entered the house of @entity15 and killed him and two other men , said the sources , who spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared retribution			1
@entity15 's legs had been paralyzed since the civil war , which lasted from 1992 until 1997			1
efforts to contact government officials for comment were not successful			1
shortly after wednesday 's killings , 3,000 residents of the city of @entity28 demonstrated outside a regional government building , demanding that the government and president @entity32 investigate why the peace agreement had been broken			1
when protesters threw rocks at the building , soldiers fired on them , wounding several , the sources said			1
a representative of the @entity40 pleaded with the protesters for calm			2
" @entity15 was loyal to this peace agreement until the end , " he said			0
during the protest , more than 40 suspected rebel fighters were taken into custody , the government said in a statement			1
last month , the @entity40 brokered a peace agreement under which rebels laid down their arms in exchange for a promise from government officials not to attack			1
the network is a private group that has worked to develop the region over the past two decades			0
the @entity61 himself , who wields considerable influence as leader of all @entity65 , adherents of the @entity60 branch followed by many @entity66 , played a key role in persuading the rebels to accept the truce			0
he had urged his spiritual followers to refrain from violence , to work for peace and to uphold the law			0
the @entity74 said july 31 that an offer of amnesty for anyone who disarmed voluntarily had resulted in 200 weapons ' being handed over to the authorities			0
but by wednesday afternoon , the initial progress toward peace had reversed			0
internet , cell phone and land line communications had been cut to the @entity86 , residents said			0
such cutoffs have been routine during periods of unrest			0
one government explanation appeared comical to some @entity66			1
" @entity94 , @entity95 , claimed that a stray bullet had severed telephone , mobile , and internet connections to the region , " @entity91 said in a posting on its website			0
the rights group expressed concern over the fate of the detainees			0
" torture remains an enduring problem within @entity4 's penitentiary system and is used to extract confessions from defendants , who are often denied access to family and legal counsel during initial detention , " it said			0
authorities have not allowed representatives of the @entity118 to visit prisoners , it added			0
an open letter to the president from " youth of @entity123 " bemoaned the deteriorating situation			1
since a military operation began in @entity28 in the center of @entity12 on july 24 , " we have been witness to military actions , civilian deaths , and crying children and mothers , " it said			1
" with every passing day , we are increasingly losing hope that peace and stability will prevail in the country again			1
" it said that the peace agreement had been adhered to by the former field commanders and that " the people of @entity28 cooperated with the government in every possible way			1
" that tense peace was first interrupted two weeks ago , when government soldiers manning a checkpoint in the town of @entity149 -- north of @entity28 -- shot at a civilian car , killing two occupants and wounding two others , the letter said			1
" despite this , we all hoped for an early resolution to the problems and the removal of the armed structures from the region to avoid further complication of the situation , " the letter said			2
but wednesday 's killing of @entity15 -- who had called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict -- " could provoke a further escalation of the situation and result in heavy casualties , " it said			0
" and this , in turn , could become a pretext for the destruction of peace and accord in @entity4 , as well as in the whole @entity177 region			0
" the letter asked that @entity32 and other government representatives " intervene in this complex situation as we believe that a purposeful process of destabilization is taking place in the country by third forces			1
" it did not elaborate on who those third forces might be			0
@entity15 's killing was preceded in july , before the peace agreement was reached , by the killing of @entity191 , a representative of the opposition @entity193			0
he had condemned what he said was the government 's indiscriminate attack on residents of @entity28 after a general was killed there			2
a @entity200 video shows soldiers dragging a man through the city streets and dumping him in a trash heap			2
residents identified the man as @entity191 ; the government said it was n't he			2
the residents have said they want the soldiers involved in the killing to be brought to justice			2
@entity193 national leader @entity211 said in a statement that even if even if the dead man was not mamadrizoev , he should have been treated humanely			0
@entity4 gained independence with the collapse of the @entity3 in 1991 but was troubled by a five - year civil war that ended in 1997 and is still plagued by widespread corruption and poverty			1
tensions remain high between the @entity4 government in the capital city of @entity222 and warlords -- so - called @entity224 -- of @entity123 , who are members of the @entity66 ethnic minority			2
the region was a stronghold of rebels during the civil war , which claimed thousands of lives			1
the war divided people along ethnic and regional lines , and the @entity66 largely sided with the opposition			2
a @entity236 - brokered peace plan left @entity32 's secular government in place but gave official jobs to some of his opponents , including the @entity242			2
@entity32 , who has @entity244 's support and faces reelection next year , has sought to consolidate power and stamp out remnants of the former opposition - turned - warlords .			0
