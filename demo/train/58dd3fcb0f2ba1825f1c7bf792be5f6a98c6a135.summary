@entity0 , @entity1 -- amid the chaos that first - responder @entity5 witnessed on friday , there is one image that he will never forget			1
it is n't the woman who was taken to the hospital after being shot in the foot at @entity12			2
it is n't the police officer he saw leaving the school 's interior covered in someone 's blood			1
what will haunt @entity5 forever is the memory of parents lined up outside the firehouse just a few hundred feet away from the school , waiting to pick up their children			1
" as the children were coming down the street , little by little , classroom by classroom all holding hands , parents were claiming their children , " says @entity5 , the first assistant fire chief at @entity26			1
" after a little while , once they claimed their kid and signed them out ... they left			2
" there were some sticking around and that 's when we realized that they 're probably not going to be leaving			1
they 're gon na get the confirmation soon enough that they 're not gon na be grabbing their child and hugging them and taking them home			0
" remembering the victims @entity5 's voice is steady , but his eyes glisten			1
" their life is changed forever			0
" @entity5 , along with @entity53 , the department 's chief engineer , were among the first responders to friday 's school massacre of 20 children and six adults			1
@entity53 was working less than half a mile from the school in the center of @entity61 when he got the call			1
" i was there very soon , " he says			0
at the time , he says , he had no idea what he was walking into			0
@entity5 and @entity53 were assigned outside the school , to an emergency triage area that did n't end up being used			1
despite their combined nearly half - century of experience , the two men say nothing could have ever prepared them for what they have now personally experienced			1
" you get the initial dispatch , and you really do n't know what you 're coming in to , but for the most part , you 're ready for it , " @entity5 says			0
" but this time , it was not the case ... if you think you 're ready for this , you 're not			0
" very early on , it was determined that this was bad -- really , really bad			0
" police and paramedics , some clad in body armor and bulletproof vests , entered the school cautiously			1
" they had to find out if anyone survived ... if there was anyone to take care of , " @entity53 says			0
outside , it was mass confusion			0
phone calls and text messages spread nearly faster than reports on police radios			0
" it was chaos down there			1
parents were coming from all directions			1
you could see the panic in everybody 's face , because they have no idea what they 're coming into , " @entity5 says			1
" they were panic - stricken and trying to get to their children , but they were stopped			1
" at the nearby firehouse , he says , he saw parents waiting in line for hours to pick up their children			1
" and there 's no more kids around to take home , " @entity5 says			1
" and you know , it 's bad			2
they 're gon na get some bad news			0
i 'm sure they knew at that point , but there 's that shred of hope there 's somebody hiding in closet or some kid they missed , but ultimately that was n't the case			2
" @entity5 is a father to a first - grader and , had they not moved two years ago , his 7 - year - old son @entity139 would have attended @entity12			2
when he returned home friday , the @entity143 did what many of the parents outside the school could not			1
" ' i love you ' was the first thing i said , " @entity5 recalls			0
" and we hugged a lot			0
of course , he 's 7 years old , so a hug in the morning is fine , and before you go to bed , but getting hugged all day long , he 's wondering what the heck 's going on			2
" he 'll understand someday			0
" @entity53 says his grieving will come later			0
" for now , ( i 've ) got ta be strong			0
" today , @entity0 is awash with emblems of tragedy : an enormous @entity161 flag , starkly silhouetted against the sky , flies at half - staff in the middle of @entity165			2
just east , on the road that leads towards @entity12 , a host of 27 wooden angel statues sing a silent chorus on the roadside , a tribute to those who died friday			2
police say @entity174 shot and killed his mother at the home they shared , before carrying out the rampage at the school where he left 26 dead and also shot and killed himself			2
a small bright note is the overwhelming support @entity0 has been receiving from around the country and the world -- including truckloads of teddy bears that firefighters are distributing to children 's groups , schools and churches			1
. " the community will go on , " @entity5 says			0
there are still a lot of children in this town waiting for @entity197 to come			1
you have to move on			0
for their sake , it 's got ta be back to normal as soon as we can get it			2
