-- the studio behind the female buddy flick " @entity3 " is probably hoping the movie will be huge			1
but there is some controversy overseas about something connected to the film that does n't appear to be as big			2
the @entity9 reports that promotional posters for the film , which stars @entity11 and @entity12 , appear to have been altered to slim @entity12 's face			1
the story notes that the @entity16 version of the poster also sports @entity12 with a digitally slimmer face			1
the poster shows @entity12 in character as a police detective and her face appears less round			1
@entity12 's neck in the poster also appears slimmer than in real life			1
representatives for the film declined to comment to @entity0 on speculation that @entity12 's face and neck appear to have been photoshopped			1
@entity34 site @entity32 put up a representation of what the poster would look like using an unaltered photo of @entity12			1
" this is one of the worst @entity43 jobs i have ever seen , but it 's not just offensively bad craftsmanship -- the intention behind it is downright nasty , " the site 's editor , @entity39 , wrote			2
it 's not the first time the plus - sized actress -- who has found fame as a co-star in the hit film " bridesmaids " and the @entity54 television show " @entity55 " -- has been at the center of controversy regarding her weight			1
in 2010 , @entity61 writer @entity60 faced a firestorm of criticism when she wrote a piece titled " @entity65 ' get a room ? ( even on tv ? ) " in which she wrote " i think i 'd be grossed out if i had to watch two characters with rolls and rolls of fat kissing each other ... because i 'd be grossed out if i had to watch them doing anything			0
" @entity60 's piece , which was inspired by a @entity0 article " weight is a big deal for tv , movie characters , " led to thousands of complaints from @entity61 website readers			2
last year @entity84 film critic @entity83 referred to @entity12 as a " female hippo " while panning her film " @entity87 , " which co-starred @entity88			1
@entity83 later defended his remarks and said the controversy helped the film sell more tickets on its opening weekend			0
" i have too many friends that have died of obesity - related illnesses , heart problems and diabetes			0
... i have helped people try to lose weight , and i do n't find this to be the subject of a lot of humor , " @entity83 told @entity99 in @entity100			0
in 2011 the actress responded to comments about her weight			0
" do i sometimes hope i wake up in the morning and people are like , ' what 's wrong with her ? she looks emaciated			0
' of course i would love that , " @entity12 said			2
" i 'm such a clothes whore i would love the opportunity to be a hanger			0
but i think i 'm more confident than i 've ever felt in my life			0
i always thought it was worth the fight			0
now i know it is			0
" " @entity3 " will be released in the @entity16 on june 28 .			2
