-- it is an unwritten rule in soccer -- once you nail your colors to the mast you must never even think about switching allegiances			2
but for one diehard @entity11 football fan , his disillusionment with his beloved club is so great he is offering his support to the highest bidder on @entity14			1
" with selling history and tradition the latest trend within football , i have decided to get on the bandwagon , " writes lifelong @entity16 fan @entity15 on his @entity14 page			1
the straw that broke the camel 's back for @entity15 was the decision by the @entity30 team 's @entity28 owners to rebrand the club by insisting they play in red rather than their traditional blue to boost their appeal to @entity38 audiences			1
so much so that @entity15 is willing to trade his dedication to the @entity41 ' cause to whoever stumps up the most cash in the internet auction , whether it is @entity46 champions @entity45 or lowly @entity47 in the far north of @entity48			2
can @entity50 's big bucks buy world football domination ? " it feels like the club have abandoned their local supporters , " @entity15 told @entity0			1
" while they play in red with a dragon on the badge i 've had my season ticket refunded and i 'm not going to go to anymore games until they 've reversed the branding			2
" i believe the board has thrown away the club 's history on a gamble that is not guaranteed to make any money anyway			1
they do n't understand the idea behind @entity16 being the @entity41 and playing in blue			2
@entity16 have played in blue since 1908			2
" the rebranding move was met with outrage by supporters of the club , who play in the second tier of the @entity77 league , when it was announced last month			0
@entity16 's @entity28 owners said the marketing exercise was part of a significant investment package that would help secure the club 's immediate financial future after a debt - laden few years and help broaden their appeal in " international markets			1
" the club 's chief executive @entity88 acknowledged it would not be a universally popular plan and @entity15 is living proof that resentment is still simmering			1
" i 've had a season ticket for the last nine years and i go to most away games as well so it was n't something i have taken lightly , but the thought of watching @entity16 play in red at home was n't something i could live with , " he said			1
" when the players come out or we score a goal we all chant ' @entity41 ' and obviously the bluebird has now been replaced by a dragon			0
" the nickname is the @entity41 but the team will now be playing in red			0
it will look silly , a stadium of blue seats , fans in blue shirts and a team playing in red			0
" but after following @entity16 the length and breadth of the country last season , when he watched his team in action 51 times , is he not apprehensive of the distance he might be required to travel to back his new team ? " it would be a bit of a trek up to @entity130 ( some 322 miles away )			1
i 'm just hoping someone from @entity132 does n't see it and try to sign me up			0
" a non-league team would be good but our local rivals @entity135 and @entity138 fans ca n't buy me -- anyone apart from that is fine			0
" the fan is dead , long live the phone ? however , it 's not just @entity16 's rebranding initiative that has upset @entity15			1
aggrieved at the change football has undergone in recent years , with the huge amounts of money sloshing around the game through tv and sponsorship deals leading to exorbitant wages for players and a big increase in foreign owners , @entity15 argues the sport is unrecognizable from the game he started to follow as a teenager			2
" i was n't around in the 1970s or 1980s but people who knew football at that time would n't be able to recognize the sport now and see the wages players are on			0
it 's not the sport i loved when i was 14 and started to go to @entity16 games , " he added			0
" fans are n't really the priority in football anymore ; it is all about money and trying to make money from tv deals			0
i think ( the owners ) are trying to get a tv deal in @entity28 to show all our games as part of the whole making @entity16 the team of choice for @entity28			1
" they said the color red is marketable in @entity38 , they think @entity38 fans and @entity28 fans wo n't care about @entity16 in a blue shirt but if they play in red at home they will suddenly take @entity16 as their team instead of @entity189 or @entity190			1
it does n't seem very likely to me			0
" bidding for @entity15 's football soul is currently running at over $ 300 , which has come as something of a shock to him			2
" with the price going far beyond anything i had expected , this is now a full charity auction			0
50 % will go to @entity200 charity and 50 % to the @entity202 charity			0
the only money i will take from this auction is enough to pay the @entity14 fees			0

disillusioned football fan offers his support for next season in auction on @entity14
@entity15 switching allegiance from @entity16 in *protest* at club 's rebranding exercise
@entity28 owners have changed club 's colors from blue to red and changed badge
