@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity4 - winning composer @entity3 enjoyed a glittering career composing the scores to many classic films			1
@entity8 composer @entity3 wrote scores for films by @entity12 legends like @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
last month , the 84 year - old who died sunday gave one of his final interviews to @entity2 's @entity19 , in conversation with fellow composer @entity21			1
@entity3 , who died of cancer , worked with many legendary directors , like @entity14 and @entity13			1
but it is the @entity8 composer 's work with @entity26 director @entity15 -- the scores to " @entity28 , " " @entity29 , " and " a passage to @entity31 , " for which he won three @entity32 -- for which he is best remembered			1
@entity34 - nominated @entity8 composer @entity21 , who has written the scores for @entity36 ' 2006 drama " @entity37 , " and last year 's " @entity38 , " regarded @entity3 as an inspiration and an influence			1
" @entity3 was an immense artist ; an incredible symphonist ; a magician of the melody and a benevolent human being , " @entity21 told @entity2 in tribute to @entity3 who he describes as the greatest composer of the last 50 years			1
@entity21 : i do n't know if you know , but the path that you traced for us @entity8 composers is phenomenal and indispensable			1
and , of course , love for cinema and theater is something that unites us , because i also wrote a lot for the theater like yourself			2
@entity3 : the love for cinema , that 's correct			1
i also had the opportunity to work with real -- to use a common word -- ' giants			0
' @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity13 ... @entity67 : and @entity14 ! @entity3 : @entity14			1
this type of director has disappeared			2
@entity67 : one can sense with your work this passion for cinema , and for images -- your complete dedication to images			0
i think i also have this devotion , in fact , i do n't think , i know , because it 's devoured me since i was an adolescent			2
there are many composers of whom i know that are film composers by default , simply because it 's a job ; it 's a good occupation			2
i do n't sense in them that love for images , and that inspiration films has given us			0
@entity3 : people who say to me , ' when you write the music for a film do you know whether the film will be a great success ? ' i tell them , ' no , i was mainly concerned about finishing the music in time			1
' @entity100 ( producer of " @entity28 ) once said , ' you have a job like @entity102 ! ' that was true because i worked day and night			1
but , at that point , i had no idea i was working on probably one of the best films in the history of cinema			0
what is your favorite @entity3 movie score ? tell us below in the @entity114 box @entity67 : this dedication to the cinema is all - encompassing			1
when one is a composer for films , it 's day and night			1
one needs to be in great physical condition ! @entity3 : oh yes ! [ @entity3 puts up fists , as though in a boxing match ] like an athlete ... @entity67 : i know that like me you must have worked 18 to 20 hours a day because there was no choice			1
unless we are directing other people , having people work for us			0
in this case you 'd probably have to do less			0
but as we 're , i think , somewhat intelligent , and in love with details and in love with the timbre of the orchestration			0
@entity3 : that 's why i was so disappointed that you lost the @entity34 [ @entity21 was nominated for @entity139 in 2006 for @entity36 ' " @entity37			1
" ] the award is not that important , but it has sentimental value for you , because i respect your work			0
@entity67 : i hope to one day achieve three @entity32 like yourself @entity3			1
but you have to keep in mind that the rewards for the work are secondary			0
@entity3 : i was very disappointed with the people who won the @entity149 and @entity34 for @entity150 last year			1
for me , it should represent the real best film scores outside of , let 's say , political factors			2
watch video : ' @entity29 ' composer dies @entity67 : what 's essential is to have extremely talented directors who listen to you			2
that 's the best reward , because your talent as a composer can express itself			2
you can search , you can invent something			0
with films where the directors are n't so great , it 's much more difficult to write good music			0
@entity3 : you know , before i wrote the first electronic score for @entity171 , for " @entity172 , " nobody wanted to hear about a purely electronic score , but @entity171 used it in an artistic manner			1
that 's what was so great			0
@entity67 : that is , for me , an example because after having done 70 or 80 film scores , i realize it is perhaps time for me to be careful not to repeat myself , and to find a new voice			0
i think that the path you took in the 1980s ... i find it extremely courageous to abandon the orchestra for electronic music			0
for me , it 's an incredible example			0
what was for you , @entity3 , the most beautiful experience , or the @entity34 which you loved most ? @entity3 : of course , it 's the first [ for " @entity28 " in 1963 ]			1
it 's a sentimental one , because @entity15 and i became good friends			0
with the good directors it was always an interesting experience -- and a difficult one -- because we always had slightly different visions at the outset			0
but , it always arranged itself			0
i never really had a ' bust - up ' with a good director			2
a good director will always find an intellectual understanding			0
and that 's what was great - i had an opportunity with all these people			2
i do n't think i can say that i ever worked with a bad director			2
there were never any real problems ; there were discussions ... a bit of diplomacy here and there .			0
