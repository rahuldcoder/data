-- the largest submarine hunt in @entity3 waters since the end of the @entity5			1
a near collision between a @entity8 military plane and a @entity3 passenger aircraft carrying 132 people			1
and the abduction of an @entity15 official from the territory of the @entity18 member , only days after @entity12 president @entity11 visited the @entity20 nation			0
any of these three incidents could have led to direct military confrontation between @entity8 and the @entity23 , a new report suggests -- and they have all taken place within the past nine months			1
the incidents are outlined in " @entity28 , " an analysis that lists more than 40 " close military encounters between @entity8 and the @entity23 " that took place in the eight months from march to october of this year			1
the report , by the @entity33 , classifies the submarine search , airline near collision and @entity15 abduction as " high - risk incidents			0
" it categorizes 11 other events as " serious " and suggests they could have escalated			0
most of them involve @entity8 aircraft threatening @entity18 or its allies			1
@entity8 plans long - range bomber flights near @entity12 shores they include what appears to have been a mock attack on the @entity52 island of @entity53 , as well as @entity8 aircraft making passes at a @entity57 warship and a @entity59 frigate , and several different incidents between @entity8 and @entity3 planes			1
the dramatic events are an expression of @entity8 president @entity65 's policy to claim ( @entity8 's ) proper place in the international system , " to force the @entity23 " to accept the fundamental change of the international order , " said @entity8 expert @entity70			1
" @entity65 is trying to intimidate the @entity23 back to friendship with @entity8 , " said @entity70 , a senior research fellow at the @entity71			2
the @entity74 - based think tank focuses on defense and security			0
" @entity65 openly said that @entity8 is a bear and a bear never asks anybody 's permission to act as it wishes , " @entity70 said			2
the @entity8 @entity81 , @entity8 @entity82 , and @entity65 's spokesman all declined to respond to multiple @entity0 requests for response to the @entity33 report			2
@entity8 officials downplayed or dismissed many of the individual incidents at the time they were first reported			0
but @entity18 itself said at the end of october it had already conducted three times more intercepts of @entity8 planes in @entity95 airspace in 2014 than in all of 2013			1
there were four intercepts of groups of @entity8 aircraft in the last few days of october alone , @entity18 said			2
the @entity33 dates the upsurge in @entity8 activity to the conflict in @entity103 and @entity8 's annexation of @entity105			1
that prompted @entity18 to " increase its military presence along its eastern flank , " including more air policing , more reconnaissance flights , more ships in the @entity20 and @entity113 , and more military exercises in the region , the report said -- all of which put the two sides in greater contact than before			2
the report speculates that @entity8 is testing and observing @entity18 and national defense systems and seeking propaganda victories by using force , or the threat of it , against its neighbors			2
the @entity23 's response will have repercussions far beyond @entity8 , @entity71 's @entity70 warned			1
" it 's not a matter of 26 combat planes flying somewhere , " he said			0
" there are many other people around the globe who would love to follow @entity65 's example			0
" that is a very important wake - up call for @entity12 society , for @entity95 societies : it 's necessary to defend your ideals , your prosperity , your wealth , " he said			0
" @entity28 " is based on media reports and statements from the @entity145 and @entity18			0
@entity0 covered many of the incidents in the report , and is cited as the source for at least one of them			0
@entity0 's @entity151 in @entity152 contributed to this report			0
