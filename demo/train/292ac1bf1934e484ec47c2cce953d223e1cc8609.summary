-- the roar of the crowd was deafening on april 9 , as 30,000 @entity3 cheered on their teams at one of @entity7 's most hotly anticipated sporting events -- except this crowd was not supporting record - breaking batsman @entity9 or marveling at @entity11 's fast spin bowl			1
the event was the @entity13 -- a fierce soccer rivalry between @entity15 and @entity16 that has seen both teams clash 299 times over the last eight decades			0
the passion of the crowd was a sign of @entity7 's long romance with the " beautiful game , " and indicative of a sport on the rise in @entity3			1
soccer 's history on the subcontinent stretches back to the late 1800s when it was introduced by @entity29 colonial administrators and its subsequent growth means that today it boasts 83 million television viewers , according to the @entity3 - based tv ratings agency @entity33			1
this figure is third only to @entity3 's @entity36 national sport and first love , cricket , which comes first with 122 million viewers , and wrestling which attracts 96 million			1
furthermore , a data study conducted by @entity33 between 2005 and 2009 found that @entity3 's football audience increased by 60 % within this five - year period			1
this trend was reinforced by a @entity46 survey in 2010 which found that 47 % of @entity3 's 1.2 billion ( 2009 @entity47 figures ) population would describe themselves as football fans			1
the popularity of the @entity52 , which is broadcast on satellite channels such as @entity54 , has also mushroomed among @entity3 's affluent middle class , who are increasingly passionate about a game traditionally perceived as working class			1
according to @entity65 , managing director of @entity60 , the channel broadcasts more than 230 @entity52 matches live every season and offers over 1500 hours of programming , thereby feeding the growth in demand			0
@entity68 , the @entity69 's group commercial director , said : " together we have grown the popularity of @entity73 football in @entity74 and we look forward to continuing this strong relationship in the coming years			1
" @entity3 's @entity77 audience has also witnessed a marked increase in recent years			1
in 2006 , the tournament was viewed by 50 million people in @entity3 through @entity60 alone -- a 44 % rise from the 2002 figure			1
popularity paradox the paradox of the recent boom in popularity is that -- unlike like other countries such as @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 -- the growth in demand has not been led by the success of the national team			1
@entity3 last qualified for the @entity77 in 1950 and currently places 146th in @entity95 's global rankings thanks to a series of qualification failures for major tournaments -- albeit interspersed by victories in the @entity100 , the @entity101 , the @entity102 and the @entity103			1
for @entity105 , ceo of @entity106 , there are a number of factors that have contributed to the current state of affairs			0
" i think a lack of international matches [ is ] a problem and our neighboring countries @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 are not strong enough , so we are not getting competitive matches , " @entity105 told @entity0			0
" [ but ] the @entity119 ( @entity119 ) has restructured their administration and recently money has been pouring into the game , so more windows of opportunity are opening up , " he added			0
" i 'm sure football has a viable market in a country with a population of 1.2 billion			0
there are many pockets across [ @entity3 ] where football is equally or more popular than cricket , such as @entity133 , @entity7 , @entity134 , @entity135 , parts of @entity137 and the whole northeast of @entity3			2
the passion is really high -- we just need to achieve something internationally			0
" the domestic dilemma the national team is not the only area of untapped potential , according to many working in football in @entity3 ; the domestic leagues and infrastructure could both be areas for development			1
@entity105 cites heavy competition for an insufficient number of stadiums prone to monsoon - inflicted damage as a notable obstacle stifling the potential of @entity3 football , which he says regularly attracts up to 500,000 spectators in the northeast of the country			1
" every state has its own football league and there are at least five divisions , " @entity105 said			2
" each division has 15 to 20 teams , so getting grounds is an issue			0
" when there are 100 grounds in a city that has 500 football teams that practice regularly , [ clubs ] hardly have time to maintain those grounds			0
" building for the future but it is at the grass roots where arguably the need is greatest and the most effort is being focused , according to @entity105			0
" lots of youths are keen to play football but we are lacking quality coaches and infrastructure			0
[ many ] senior teams get the facilities but youths do n't			0
" football coach @entity187 , agrees with the sentiment and founded the @entity189 in @entity137 in 1998 as a way to combat what he saw as poor standards of youth coaching			0
" there was a big disconnect between what i 'd been doing and the kind of things the schools were doing with my child , " he told @entity0			0
" the coaching was designed for adults not for seven - year - olds			0
" @entity187 says the professional football he encountered when he relocated to @entity3 from @entity29 in the early 1990s was " amateurish " and held back by the government - controlled @entity205 of @entity3 and the @entity119 , which administers association football in @entity3 and controls the top - tier @entity208			2
but due to funding from the @entity74 ( @entity74 ) , which has recently insisted on the @entity119 employing professionals , @entity187 thinks the situation is improving			2
" the @entity74 have really worked hard to professionalize football in @entity3 , " he said			1
" ten years ago , there was nowhere near this level of professionalism			0
the @entity74 are insisting on a particular management structure and a particular academy structure , otherwise [ clubs ] will not be recognized and allowed in the national league			2
" there are further moves from the @entity119 to build on these foundations too , after the body announced in april plans to restart the @entity74 's @entity225 program , which aims to increase the national association 's efficiency , improve youth and grass roots football participation through programs and activities and develop national competitions for clubs and players			1
meanwhile , @entity95 has continued to make inroads in centralizing the administration of @entity3 football through its two goal projects and in improving footballing infrastructure			1
in 2007 , @entity95 launched the $ 8 million " win in @entity3 " project to build a range of football grounds across the country			1
construction of three turf pitches in @entity135 , @entity248 and @entity249 is due for completion in june 2011 , while five further pitches are scheduled to be built across @entity7 , @entity252 , @entity133 and @entity253			0
a @entity95 spokesman told @entity0 : " @entity95 is convinced of the huge potential of @entity3 in terms of football development			1
this is why @entity95 devised the program win in @entity3 , which is now being implemented			2
" @entity95 has been working with the @entity119 with the two goal projects , helping in building the association 's headquarters in @entity137 , as well as two technical centers in @entity263 and @entity264			2
" untapped player potential infrastructure aside , @entity3 is increasingly seen as an area that could provide talent to the top clubs in @entity269			2
in 2009 , @entity29 's @entity270 joined forces with @entity3 educational institution @entity272 and the @entity69 to launch the @entity273 ( @entity273 ) in @entity253			2
@entity273 is the first collaboration between an @entity52 club and an @entity3 college aimed at fostering @entity3 football excellence through a range of courses devised in partnership with leading @entity29 educational institutes			1
@entity52 giants @entity282 and @entity283 have targeted talented @entity3 youths for training in the @entity29 , while @entity286 have expressed interest in establishing a football academy in @entity3			2
a spokesperson for @entity286 told @entity0 : " it is clear that the game is growing in popularity on the subcontinent			0
@entity286 's " search for an @entity302 " demonstrates beyond doubt that there is a huge passion for football within the @entity299 community as well as a considerable talent base			0
" may will see almost 400 young @entity299 players travel to our training ground battling it out to win a trial at our world famous academy			0
already four previous winners have gone on to play at professional academies and we hope we have inspired many others to develop their game at a higher level			0

@entity3 's 83 million football fans are a testament to a sport *rapidly* on the rise across the subcontinent
despite such *grassroots* support however , @entity3 's national team ranks 146th globally
*experts* blame poor international *exposure* and bad management for the state of @entity3 football
@entity74 and @entity95 are trying to improve the game by *injecting* funding for infrastructure
