-- a pregnant @entity1 has moved out of the house			1
@entity3 has sworn off drinking			0
@entity6 and @entity5 have committed to monogamous relationships			0
the wildest cast in reality tv is starting to seem downright ... grown up			1
what 's " @entity11 " coming to ? " they 're starting to take those next steps into adulthood , " says @entity13 's executive vp of programming and head of production , @entity17 , giving the network 's first interview about the sixth season of the reality megahit			1
" what 's going to be different this season is how much their lives had changed			2
" last week , the cast reunited in @entity30 after an 11 - month hiatus			1
that 's the longest production break ever between " @entity34 " seasons			2
after spending a few days in the " @entity34 " house , last night @entity1 made good on her threats to leave and moved next door			1
@entity13 notes it 's not the first time a cast member has exited the house during production			1
" it 's not a prison , " @entity17 says of the " @entity34 " house			2
" i know she 's concerned about the perception of her being a pregnant woman in a party house			2
i think that 's a common experience among a group of friends when somebody gets pregnant			2
this is an opportunity to see how she deals with it and how the rest of the house deals with it			0
the show has always been about following what 's really happening in their lives			0
" " @entity34 " executive producer @entity61 , who 's currently on location at @entity30 , says the production always has a back - up location in case there 's a serious meltdown at the main " shore " residence			1
but obviously the network and producers prefer to keep the cast under the same roof			0
" the house is not the party , " @entity61 says			0
" it 's a free - standing , innocent object			1
it 's whatever the people do inside that 's the atmosphere that 's created			0
" unlike recent years , only one season of " @entity11 " is scheduled for production this year and @entity13 has a lot riding on it			1
even after last season 's ratings dip , the series remains a basic - cable phenomenon , averaging 7.6 million viewers			2
@entity13 hopes the extended hiatus will result in an exciting season compared to , for instance , season 5 , which was shot back - to - back with @entity92			1
" the show has surprised us in the past and we 're super excited about this season , " @entity17 says			0
" i would n't make any assumptions about what the season will do			0
" the executive says the network has been fully supportive of all the changes in the lives of its " @entity11 " cast , even if it means less on - screen partying			1
" i do n't think anybody expected @entity1 to be the one to blaze that trail , but she is , and it 's going to change the dynamic with everybody else , " @entity17 says			1
" she 's just as funny , if not funnier , than she 's ever been			0
" there have admittedly been some adjustments to accommodate @entity1 's pregnancy , he says			1
" at one point they had talked about going skydiving , so she 's not going to be jumping out of a plane			0
" as for @entity3 , who reportedly went to rehab for a prescription drug problem and is now swearing off alcohol , @entity17 notes , " drinking was never a problem for him			0
he 's taking steps to be as healthy as possible and we support that			2
" @entity61 likewise promises the upcoming season will be just as entertaining as in the past , just " a different kind of entertaining			0
" so far on the set , there 's been plenty of joking around about @entity1 's pregnancy and @entity3 's sobriety			1
says @entity61 : " it 's like a high school sex - ed video gone insane			2
