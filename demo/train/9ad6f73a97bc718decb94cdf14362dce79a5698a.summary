three or four years ago , it was supposed to be the next big thing in consumer tech : the magic of @entity4 , right in your living room			1
fast - forward to today , however , and the truth comes right at you			0
despite waves of hype , @entity10 has never caught on			0
and now that one of its biggest early champions is abandoning the format , some are wondering whether the @entity4 experiment should be declared dead			1
@entity19 , which in 2010 announced that it would offer events like @entity22 soccer and the @entity24 national championship football game in @entity4 , now says it will stop doing so this year			1
" @entity27 was great at home but due to low adoption of @entity10 to home , we are discontinuing to focus on other products for fans and affiliates , " @entity19 spokeswoman @entity25 announced on @entity26			1
she followed up by promising that the network will keep trying to push the boundaries of the viewing experience			0
" @entity27 production unmatched ! " she wrote			0
" as tech leader , @entity19 will continue to experiment with things like @entity41 ( ultra high - definition )			1
" analysts say @entity19 's reasoning reflects a sad truth for an industry that once thought the runaway success of movies like " @entity49 " meant consumers would have similar interest in watching @entity4 in their living rooms			1
" the excitement around @entity10 was coming from many places : the industry , the tv manufacturers and the content providers , " said @entity53 , a technology analyst for @entity54			1
" but not the consumers , and ultimately that is what proved fatal			0
" according to data from research firm @entity64 , adoption of @entity10 in @entity66 peaked in early 2011 , when about 11 % of tv owners had one			0
but growth has stalled and even dipped since then			0
the technology fared better among tv owners in the rest of the world , growing to about 20 % of the market before beginning to slide late last year			1
quite simply , @entity53 said , consumers just have n't considered it worth the money			0
@entity80 that with consumer - tech trends moving in the opposite direction , and it 's a recipe for failure , she said			0
" the lack of content and the higher cost of the hardware made adoption slow , " she said			1
" and now we see consumers focus their money on other consumer electronics such as tablets , adding screens to their home rather than focusing on the main screen			0
" complaints about home 3 - d have centered around high prices , the limited number of @entity4 offerings and the awkward glasses that made viewing uncomfortable over long periods of time			1
and many consumers , having recently traded in their clunky tube tvs for high - def flat screens , were n't ready to replace their sets yet again with newer models			2
@entity19 's @entity4 channel has been carried by several cable networks , but @entity110 's @entity109 dumped all @entity4 in 2011 , saying it was too expensive			1
that 's not the sort of thing that 's going to encourage many producers or networks to make their own @entity4 shows or pay for the pricey equipment needed to shoot live events in three dimensions			2
a few other @entity4 providers remain , most notably 3net , a channel jointly owned by @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124			2
in a statement , @entity125 said @entity19 's decision would have " no impact on our business			2
" " it 's understandable that content creators are hesitant to continue investing in costly new technologies if the viewer base is not growing at an attractive rate , " said @entity130 , @entity64 's director of tv research in @entity66			2
" this move by @entity19 might signal that the momentum has shifted away from @entity4 in the @entity139 , and tv manufacturers and retailers would be wise to take note			1
" that momentum appears now to be swinging toward the technology @entity145 mentioned in her post : ultra hd , also known as @entity41			2
screens on that emerging format promise definition that 's four times sharper than regular hd			0
@entity123 is leading the pack with a giant @entity41 model already on the market and others hitting stores soon			0
but other manufacturers are n't far behind			0
as with @entity10 , there 's still not a ton of available content for that level of definition			0
but @entity41 is in its infancy , and observers , including @entity53 , predict it will catch on in a way that home 3 - d never has .			1

@entity19 announced it will *suspend* 3 - d tv *broadcasts* by end of the year
the prospect of @entity4 excited the tv industry , but consumers never took to it
consumers complained about cost , awkward glasses , scarce @entity4 content
analysts say @entity41 , @entity41 television may be the next wave
