-- hey girl ... mr. @entity2 is n't the only @entity3 with his own stable of @entity6 memes any more			1
whether it 's a texting secretary of state , a condescending candy magnate or an unimpressed gymnast , the @entity7 ca n't help itself when it comes to turning current events into running online jokes			2
so , why should politics be any different ? enter @entity3			1
the @entity16 congressman was well known among political junkies , but not so much to the general public before presumptive @entity19 presidential nominee @entity18 tapped him saturday as his running mate			1
within hours , the @entity7 greeted the conservative budget hawk with a host of humor , some of it new and some given new life after lying dormant during the long , hot @entity28 summer			0
here are some of our favorites so far : ' @entity33 , it 's @entity3 ' these women were meme - ing @entity3 before meme - ing @entity3 was cool			1
back in may , the self - described " women who think fiscal sanity and conservative values are sexier than anything else " started a @entity37 feed featuring photos of @entity3 with captions merging his politics with a smooth , " hey baby " vibe			1
the blog borrowed from another web meme : outings inspired by actor @entity2 that include " @entity50 --- yeah @entity2 " and " feminist @entity2			0
" some @entity3 examples : _ hey girl ... you know i ca n't inflate our love			1
and that would just devalue it anyways			0
_ hey girl ... unlike the debt , our love will never hit a ceiling			0
_ hey girl ... i may be vying for # 2 but you 'll always be my # 1 _ hey girl ... let 's get fiscal			2
apparently they 're not alone in thinking deficit reduction is hot			0
according to @entity72 stats , the most common term searched along with " @entity3 " this weekend was " vice president			1
" the second most common ? " shirtless			0
" the women had pretty much retired " @entity33 , it 's @entity3 " until @entity18 's announcement on saturday			1
it 's been off to the ( presidential ) races since then			2
@entity80 looks like ... ok , so it 's focusing just on that hairdo - defining widow 's peak of his , but the leading candidate for @entity3 's celebrity lookalike so far has been @entity87 -- the similarly peaked kid from " @entity88			1
" but that 's not all			2
some folks see @entity92 from " @entity93 " ( i.e. actor @entity94 )			2
others move a few cubicles down and compare him to " @entity93 " character @entity3 ( aka @entity98 , who 's already getting support from people who want him to play @entity101 on " @entity102			1
" @entity103 if the women behind the " @entity33 " blog are @entity3 fans , it 's safe to guess that whoever took the joke to @entity109 is not			1
comically merging the politician with the actor , @ @entity112 was born saturday and has quickly attracted more than 23,000 followers			0
some sample tweets : _ " hey girl , let 's get rid of @entity117 ! " _ " hey girl , you do n't need @entity120 for that hip replacement			2
you just need one of my hugs			0
" _ " hey girl , you ca n't spell @entity16 without ' sin '			0
" whether his newfound web fame will help or hurt @entity3 politically is anyone 's guess -- although , in our mind , it 's hard to picture someone deciding who should run the country based on a photoshopped image of @entity3 posing in front of the @entity139			1
( yes , he has apparently driven it			0
) but there 's one thing we can all be sure of			0
