-- the @entity2 administration announced new standards for commercial pilot training tuesday , with transportation secretary @entity5 calling it a " significant advancement for aviation safety and pilot training			1
" the new rules from @entity11 and the @entity12 will reinforce ground and flight training on aerodynamic stall and " upset , " enabling pilots to prevent and recover from potential disaster			1
the emphasis will be on pilots gaining experience on handling a stall during simulator training			2
during an aerodynamic stall , the plane loses its lift			2
if the pilot does n't correct it , the plane may crash			1
that is what investigators say led to the 2009 @entity32 crash near @entity33 , @entity34			1
the pilots did not recognize the plane was slowing down too quickly , investigators said			2
when confronted with signs that the @entity40 plane was entering an aerodynamic stall , the pilot pulled on the plane 's control column when he should have pushed -- a simple error that led to the death of 50 people , according to the @entity47 ( @entity47 )			1
investigators said the pilots were not adequately trained to handle stalls			2
the new pilot training standard not only calls for teaching pilots how to react and prevent aerodynamic stalls			1
it also mandates expanded training on how to handle crosswinds , wind gusts , enhanced runway safety procedures and more effective pilot monitoring			1
@entity47 board members said they were struck by the amount of conversation between the @entity40 captain and first officer , saying it was " almost continuous			0
" by continuously conversing , the crew " squandered time and their attention " -- resources that should have been spent gaining awareness of their surroundings and preventing errors , according to the @entity47			0
the crash prompted @entity75 to order new rule changes and update regulations			0
families of @entity80 crash victims pushed hard for lawmakers to act			0
" one of my first meetings as transportation secretary was with the @entity32 families , and today , i am proud to announce that with their help , the @entity12 has now added improved pilot training to its many other efforts to strengthen aviation safety , " said @entity5			1
tuesday 's new pilot training rule addresses a congressional mandate in the @entity93 and @entity94 of 2010 to ensure enhanced pilot training			1
it is the third of significant rulings required by the act , including increased qualification requirements for first officers who fly @entity103 passenger and cargo planes issued in july 2013			0
the @entity12 mandated that pilots will need more cockpit training to become fully certified first officers for @entity103 passenger and cargo airlines			0
co-pilots must complete 1,500 hours ' total time as a pilot under the new rules , which took effect august 1			2
previously , first officers were required to have only a commercial pilot certificate , which requires 250 hours of flight time			0
the rule also requires first officers to undergo new training and testing specifics to the planes they fly			0
in december 2011 , final rules to prevent pilot fatigue were finalized			2
the sweeping pilot fatigue rule governs how much time off commercial passenger pilots must have between work shifts , ensuring they have a longer opportunity for rest before they enter the cockpit			0
it sets a 10 - hour minimum rest period prior to a flight duty period , a two - hour increase over the old rules			0
the new rule also mandates that a pilot must have an opportunity for eight hours of uninterrupted sleep within the 10 - hour rest period			0
@entity12 administrator @entity141 said at tuesday 's announcement this is the first fundamental rewrite of pilot training requirements in two decades			1
air carriers will have five years to comply with the rule 's new pilot training provisions , which the agencies say will allow time for the necessary software updates to be made in flight simulation technology			1

new rules for pilot training
crash of plane in @entity33 , @entity34 , *impetus* for some changes
recovering from stalls , wind gusts among priorities
