@entity0 and @entity1 wish they had never seen the need to start their own business			1
they wish @entity0 had never been diagnosed with @entity8 's lymphoma			1
they wish their daughter , @entity10 , had not joined @entity11 in the hospital , to fight her own battle against an aggressive tumor			1
they wish @entity10 had won			1
but wishing to change the past , the @entity16 know , is useless			1
" when our daughter died , @entity0 and i took some time away and re-grouped our life , " @entity1 said in a @entity18			1
" we made the decision that we were going to focus on positive things and do positive things in our lives			0
" double diagnoses during her pregnancy in 2010 , @entity0 noticed swollen lymph nodes in her neck			1
she ignored them , because she had experienced swelling before during allergy season			0
they did n't ache , she said , just made her neck appear uneven			0
in june 2010 , the @entity34 couple became first - time parents to a healthy seven - pound baby they named @entity10			1
but the swelling on the right side of @entity0 's neck persisted			1
by january , her doctors determined the cause : stage three @entity8 's lymphoma			1
the cancer had spread to @entity0 's chest , neck and abdomen			1
through her monthly chemotherapy , @entity0 dealt with nausea and fatigue			1
but her treatment was going well , and the side effects were mild , so she thought the worst would soon be over			0
then one april morning , she and her husband noticed that @entity10 was n't wandering around as she normally would			1
even more startling , her eyes were swollen and her eyelids were black , blue and yellow			0
" it looked like she had been in a fight , " @entity0 said			2
@entity10 was also cranky and vomiting			2
she had swelling in both her ears and a bulge the size of an egg on her right temple			0
" her head looked like it was exploding , " @entity1 said			2
they rushed her to the emergency room			0
for three weeks , pediatricians and neurosurgeons focused on her head , taking ct scans to see whether she had bleeding there			0
the scans came out clean			0
finally , doctors found a neuroblastoma tumor in @entity10 's abdomen			1
she was in stage four			0
neuroblastoma is one of the most common types of cancer for infants and children , behind leukemia and brain cancer			0
there are about 700 new cases of neuroblastoma diagnosed each year in the @entity90 , according to the @entity91			2
it is an aggressive malignant tumor that develops in infants and kids when their immature nerve cells turn into tumors instead of cells and fibers			0
a woman and her toddler fight dual cancers when her father heard the news , he went numb			0
" i thought , ' my @entity105 , i 'm at risk of losing both of my family members , the two most important people in my life			0
' " the cancer had spread throughout her tiny body , to her adrenal glands , bone marrow and ears			0
@entity10 needed chemotherapy right away			2
now she and @entity0 shared more than their blonde hair , bright blue eyes and love for peaches			2
a simple solution @entity123 did n't slow @entity10 down much			2
in between needles and diaper changes , the toddler wandered the halls of @entity128 , toting her stuffed purple gorilla named @entity130			0
but the peripherally inserted central catheter , or @entity137 line , doctors placed in @entity10 's arm to administer treatment kept getting in the way			1
the long flexible tube that was giving @entity10 essential nutrition and medications kept getting tangled			2
" this new attached toy was now a drumstick , teething toy and something to tug on , " @entity1 said			2
" when we asked the nurse how to secure the lines and caps the only suggestion they had was to use a sock or tape			0
" when @entity10 developed a bad rash from the medical tape , her mother knew they needed a better option			2
@entity0 loved to sew -- winter hats , diaper bags , you name it -- but her projects had fallen to the wayside with the family 's hospital schedule			1
one night @entity0 went home and dug out her sewing machine , grabbed some cotton knit fabric and created a sleeve that would hopefully secure @entity10 's line comfortably			1
the wrap held @entity10 's line in place without letting it dangle , causing any itchiness or pain			1
@entity10 went back to playing with her toys and ignored the @entity137 line			2
a few weeks later , when a doctor inserted a central chest line , @entity0 replicated her efforts to create a chest wrap for the toddler			1
the wraps became a hit in the hospital ward			0
nurses loved that they could access @entity10 's lines easily without taking off a bunch of tape			1
parents asked @entity0 to create more wraps for their kids			1
@entity1 filed a provisional application for a patent on the popular product , then went back to caring for his wife and child			2
" @entity0 would have much rather designed and sewed something else besides the wraps , " @entity1 said			1
" but she did what she had to do to help our child			0
it worked and we solved a problem			0
" @entity0 's cancer went into remission in september 2011			1
@entity10 passed away a few months later			2
' i love my @entity211 ' the @entity16 took some time after @entity10 's death to grieve			1
but they knew they wanted to help other patients with the wraps @entity0 had created			1
they spent most of 2012 finding a sewing contractor in @entity34 and a fabric producer in @entity218 before launching @entity219 , @entity220 they now offer the wraps on their website and on @entity224			0
patients can purchase individual wraps ; hospitals and treatment facilities can buy them in bulk			2
so far two hospital groups have purchased @entity232 products for their patients , @entity1 said			1
" breaking into the medical product community is challenging , " he said			0
" but with every challenge there seems to be an equal reward			0
... while we still have a long way to go before we can call ourselves a success , we feel like we are headed in the right direction			0
" the @entity16 are working on developing more products , @entity1 said , so that every patient with a catheter can be given a wrap to keep their line in line			1
" we know how stressful it is when that line is first put in , and how much you have to learn to take care of it , " he said			0
" we do n't think that any patient should have to search for their own solution like we did			0
" the couple wishes they never saw the need to start this company , but they 're glad they did			0
they know it 's the best way to honor their daughter , and her courageous battle against cancer			2
a little boy walked up to the @entity16 ' conference table in @entity270 this summer and said , " i love my @entity211			0
" it 's still @entity1 's favorite " review			1
" " it made us feel like we had truly made a different in that little boy and his family 's life			0
