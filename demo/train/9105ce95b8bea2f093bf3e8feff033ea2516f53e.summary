@entity0 watches intently as her sister @entity1 gets a makeover at a designer cosmetics kiosk in the middle of one of @entity7 's most popular malls , @entity8			1
shades of velvety pink blush roll over @entity1 's olive cheeks			1
she holds up a mirror and inspects the results			1
behind the kiosk , a clothing and lingerie store displays trendy fashions on mannequins with blond hair , blue eyes and milky white complexions			1
they look nothing like @entity0 and her sister or the hundreds of other @entity26 milling about this upscale shopping complex on a sunday afternoon			1
even the advertisements and store posters that use @entity26 faces promote a look that is unattainable for most @entity26 : long , silky straight hair ; a tall , thin body ; and , most importantly , a fair complexion			1
the most popular @entity36 stars such as @entity37 -- a former @entity38 -- look more white than @entity26			1
" being white is the preference , " says @entity0 , 23 , an insurance brokerage firm employee			1
" there 's a different psychology here			2
i think @entity26 women have problems with acceptance			1
" " @entity49 hai sundar , " she says			2
@entity0 says this tongue in cheek			2
she knows it 's racist -- and disagrees with this collective thinking			2
as far back as i can remember , a woman 's complexion has been a very big deal in my native land			2
when i was a child , my aunt forbade me to play outside lest i turn several shades darker in the sun. the same aunt lamented after one of my trips to @entity66 that the strong sun had made me " black			1
" " you used to be so pretty , " she said			2
in other words : " you used to be so light - skinned			2
" many @entity26 feel their country 's disturbing obsession with fairness has been compounded in recent years with the invasion of @entity76 and @entity77 retail outlets and widespread access to information via the @entity80			1
the discussion was reignited after @entity82 , a woman of @entity26 descent , was crowned @entity84			1
many here wondered : could someone as dark complexioned as @entity87 win a pageant in the country of her heritage ? opinion : @entity84 , @entity92 and the beauty of choice @entity95 , the kiosk employee doing the makeover on @entity0 's sister , says she often has clients who choose foundation or powder that is too light for them			1
" they say they want to look like her , " @entity95 says pointing to a giant clothing ad featuring a white woman			2
" but you ca n't camouflage what you are			2
" that 's the saddest thing in our country , " she says as her sister 's face is transformed into @entity36 glamor			2
" looks , color of skin -- we should ignore such things			2
but even those here who do not dispute the new @entity84 's beauty said this : a pageant or a @entity36 role is one thing , but when it comes down to finding a bride for a beloved son , @entity82 , despite her stunning looks , would be too dark to make the cut			1
sure enough , matrimonial ads in @entity26 -- arranged marriages are still the way many young people choose to wed -- often read like this : " seeking match for beautiful , tall , fair girl ... " and those women who are the norm in @entity26 -- that is , not light - skinned -- are targeted by a $ 400 million skin - whitening - cream industry			1
it began years ago with a product called @entity145			2
former miss california : how do we teach kids diversity is beautiful ? i was first introduced to it through a letter from @entity26 35 years ago			1
it was from one of my childhood friends in @entity156			2
she was getting married and wanted to look her best on her wedding day			2
her parents thought they were lucky to have secured her a good husband in an arranged marriage			0
she was , after all , dark complexioned			0
she said she had been using @entity145 but was n't satisfied with the results			0
she wanted me to bring her something better from @entity84			1
i 've noticed on my visit here that @entity145 is still on the shelves			0
but women who can afford it have a wide selection of products from which to choose			0
there is even a vaginal wash that promises freshness , protection and , of course , skin lightening			0
some people blame the industry for making the problem worse			0
but @entity183 of @entity184 , the manufacturer of the vaginal wash , said the company is simply ceding to customer demands			0
" we had a very proactive consumer coming in and asking us for this product , and i think it would be very irresponsible of us to not to provide that as a solution , " @entity183 says			0
in @entity156 , i ventured into a beauty products store that carried a dizzying array of skin creams			0
@entity197 told me the skin - lightening creams were the store 's most popular products			0
it does n't matter that they do n't really make you two shades lighter in a matter of a week			0
women keep buying the stuff , believing there might be a chance			0
their hope is fueled by @entity36 megastars such as @entity212 , a darker - complexioned actor who had been peddling a cream made by @entity214 called @entity145 and @entity215			1
@entity212 tells @entity26 that he gained success after using the cream			1
@entity217 , a former @entity218 who now runs a finishing school for women in @entity7 , says @entity26 is still struggling to get over its colonial past			1
" we , of course , in @entity26 are very obsessed with being very fair			1
i think it 's something the @entity227 left us with , " @entity225 says			0
@entity225 tells me she is convinced that @entity26 needs someone like @entity231 to do for @entity26 women what the star did for black women in @entity84 -- to make @entity26 proud of their culture , their heritage , their looks			1
she also blames the infiltration of @entity77 culture for making @entity26 society so focused on physical beauty			1
" @entity77 culture places a lot of importance on looks , " she says			0
@entity26 stand at a crossroads , @entity225 says			1
" how much do we pick up from the @entity248 ? " documentary brings light to ' @entity251 ' some @entity26 are trying to reverse the movement to be fair			1
actor @entity253 has lent her face to the " @entity256 is beautiful " campaign , trying to foment change			0
" the point is do we want to capitalize this prejudice and lack of self worth and further perpetuate it , " @entity262 says in the campaign , " or do we want to address it in a way and empower more women and make them feel good in the way they are ? " back at the @entity7 mall , @entity269 , 31 , says it 's a shame @entity26 are so obsessed with skin tones			1
" i think mentally , we are not free , " he says , admitting that he once tried lightening creams on his own chocolate skin			0
he says he used to teach @entity275 to @entity276 at the posh @entity277 in @entity7			0
sometimes , the guards assumed he was a laborer			0
he says he was a victim of profiling because of his dark complexion			0
he tried skin - lightening creams but gave it all up once he began to gain more confidence in himself			0
@entity285 , 28 , rattles off a list of actresses he says personify his ideal of beauty : @entity290 , @entity291 and @entity26 actor @entity292 , who is light - skinned			1
but @entity294 goes against the grain			0
when it comes to marrying someone , he says , he wo n't care if she is white , brown or black			0
it 's what inside that matters , he says			0
" really ? " i ask him			0
" really , " he says			0
i did n't know whether to believe him , especially in the midst of the retail madness of this @entity7 mall			0
but i am glad he said it .			0

many @entity26 feel the disturbing obsession with fairness is compounded by @entity313
