@entity5 is a good friend of mine and i have tried to persuade him that @entity3 has a market that should not be ignored			1
i would be very , very disappointed if @entity3 fell into the category of being in the @entity12 calendar and then being permanently out of the calendar			1
" so says dr. @entity14 -- wealthy industrialist , parliamentarian , @entity17 co-owner , force of nature and motorsport nut -- from the comfort of an antique chair in the office of his plush @entity23 , @entity5 residence			1
the 57 - year - old has always gone about business in his own way			0
dubbed the " @entity33 " for the playboy style of his younger days and his ownership of @entity32 breweries , it is maybe fitting that one of the subcontinent 's most powerful men ( @entity38 suggests he has a personal wealth of $ 800 million ) dresses in what seem to be pajama bottoms and a polo shirt for @entity6 's visit to his stately and opulent home			0
interactive : inside the @entity3 @entity46 his clothing style might be eclectic and his style relaxed , but his passion for @entity12 in @entity3 is resolute			1
" from what i understand , we are going to give 2014 a skip because of scheduling issues -- there are three new grands prix scheduled next year -- and i am hoping that we will be back with an @entity58 in 2015 , " @entity14 states between draws on his cigarillo			1
" it 's large -- yes , @entity3 has its problems and some frustrations that go with it ... but the market is just too big and far too important for @entity12 to ignore			1
" it 's the kind of demographic that makes taking @entity12 to emerging markets and away from its traditional @entity68 heartland -- a bold and controversial policy of the sport 's ever - entrepreneurial supremo @entity9 -- seem like a logical step			1
there have been perceived successes , such as the night race of @entity76 , @entity78 's bridgehead to the @entity80 market and the purpose - built @entity82 venue that showcases @entity83			0
but this has come at the expense of others			0
interactive : how does an @entity12 steering wheel work ? fans of the @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 ( to mention a few ) fear that the road to reinstate their races to the @entity12 calendar , after they made way for the newcomers , remains as long and challenging as @entity99 's back straight on blistered tires			1
put simply : if you 're dropped from the schedule it 's hard to bounce back			0
which might explain anxieties being felt at the @entity106 ahead of this weekend 's race in @entity108 , near @entity109			0
it has been shelved for 2014 due to @entity9 's desire to move its place to march because of increasing costs due to rupee depreciation and tax issues faced by the teams			0
the race organizers were unable to stage two races within five months to accommodate @entity9 's wishes			0
@entity120 , president of the @entity121 of @entity3 , this week told @entity123 newspaper @entity122 he feared the race may never return despite promises to the contrary for 2015			1
@entity14 remains bullish but admits there may be need of a new approach from the state to secure the event 's future			2
" @entity12 needs @entity3 because of the economic opportunities in the country going forward , given its size and scale			1
but you know , the @entity109 @entity46 is actually staged by the track owners , " he says			0
" there is no government involvement -- the government only gives the necessary permissions and government does n't have any financial exposure whatsoever to the @entity12 event			2
" i wish that the government would actually force some support to @entity12 -- it 's good for tourism , it 's good for the country 's image , and other governments across the world believe in it , and i hope the @entity3 government will one day believe in it			1
" critics argue that @entity12 faces stiff competition for the attention of sport fans in @entity3 , with the cost of tickets being out of reach for the bulk of the population -- and with cricket , hockey and the @entity169 laying claims to the hearts of the population 's affinities			1
a fear some argued was borne out when attendance at the 2012 race dropped from over 90,000 in its first year to around 65,000 in its second			2
but @entity14 , whose love of motorsport started when racing single - seaters in the 1970s and moved to @entity12 with sponsorship of the @entity183 team in 1995 , feels there is good reason to be hopeful			1
" @entity3 is a very prosperous country in the overall sense			2
it also has its fair share of challenges , a lot of underprivileged people in poverty and so on			0
so , it has to be viewed in that context , " he says			0
" over the last 20 years , while i have always dreamed of hosting an @entity12 race or participating in an @entity12 race , economically it seemed like @entity197 -- a challenge that many times was sort of insurmountable			2
" and so when the grand prix group actually invested in the new track in @entity108 , outside @entity109 , and @entity12 in @entity3 became reality , i mean , it was almost miraculous , it was like a lifelong dream come true			1
" there is no drought of potential fans			2
you know , we have more than 500 million young @entity3 below the age of 18 , and that 's a lot			2
cricket is number one in @entity3 and has been there for decades			2
so , one should n't try to change that at all			0
" but you know , modern racing ... is glamorous , it 's exciting and that is attractive enough			0
yes , football is popular in @entity3 , but only in five states , it 's not a pan-indian game			0
hockey is our national sport , but sadly over the years it sort of lost its mass popularity			0
" so yes , i mean , there are hundreds of millions of @entity3 who are there and are potential fans for each sport			1
there 's space enough for everyone			0
" the ambition to act as a catalyst for @entity238 in @entity3 has become a personal crusade for @entity14			1
when he bought the @entity241 team in 2007 he renamed it " @entity17 " and made its colors orange , white and green to evoke national pride rather than promote the brands he owns , as with @entity245 for example			2
he 'd also cite the money he 's plowed into the @entity17 @entity248 , which has unearthed the @entity3 driver @entity249 , on whom many hopes are being pinned for the future			1
but @entity14 -- a man whose yacht dwarfs all others in harbor of @entity255 come gp time -- knows nothing inspires like victory			0
in this regard , he knows his team is still battling the odds this weekend : " we came very close to a few podiums in 2013 , for some reason it did n't happen			0
i would be absolutely over the moon if we got a podium this year before the season ended ! " @entity17 's drivers , @entity269 and @entity270 , will also be hoping for a good result -- so @entity14 is inclined to delve into his wallet to renew their contracts for next year .			1

businessman @entity14 is living his dream as a @entity12 team boss
@entity17 co-owner hopes his home country will continue to host the sport
@entity3 race is off 2014 calendar but is *expected* to return the following year
@entity14 says @entity3 has hundreds of millions of potential @entity12 fans
