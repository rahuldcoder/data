-- well , so much for the idea that @entity2 do n't care about soccer			1
the @entity2 national team made it out of the so - called " group of death " thursday to advance to the knockout round of competition at the @entity10 in @entity11			1
regardless of how much further the @entity13 advance in the biggest sporting event on the planet , they already have revealed something that even casual observers can see			2
soccer is now woven inextricably into the fabric of @entity2 life			1
television viewership numbers continue to set new highs with each @entity2 game the proverbial office water cooler has been abuzz with chatter about the @entity2 team 's dramatic 2 - 1 win over @entity28 and its heartbreaking , last second 2 - 2 tie with @entity30			1
" where are you watching the game " has become the question of the day			0
thousands filled the streets for viewing parties in @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 -- in the middle of the workday			0
soccer used to be their game -- the @entity47 , the @entity48 , the @entity49			1
today it is our game too , bringing the nation together in a passionate embrace of its athleticism , its skill and , yes , its excitement			0
but it has n't always been this way			0
even after the @entity2 hosted the @entity10 for the first time in 1994 -- setting attendance records that still stand today -- many still dismissed soccer as somehow not quite @entity2			1
some , like political commentator @entity65 , still do			0
she wrote thursday in the @entity66 : " i promise you : no @entity2 whose great - grandfather was born here is watching soccer , " she said in an op - ed. " one can only hope that , in addition to learning @entity74 , these new @entity2 will drop their soccer fetish with time			1
" a few million @entity2 disagree			0
slowly , but surely though , soccer has grown on us as a nation			2
why ? a changing @entity80 has become younger and more diverse , and those two demographics simply love soccer more than their parents			1
increased immigration from regions where you learn how to kick a soccer ball as soon as you learn how to walk -- @entity80 , @entity49 , @entity47 -- and particularly , our growing @entity89 population , is only deepening the nation 's relationship with soccer			1
in the @entity2 , the @entity95 population has soared to 17 % , according to the @entity96			0
and that number is only growing			0
and by most estimates , the @entity2 will be more non-white than white somewhere around 2043 , with most of that growth coming from countries where soccer is the dominant sport			1
and members of the millennial generation -- those born between 1980 and the early 2000s -- have been big drivers of the growth in soccer in the @entity2 between 1990 and today , the number of players registered in organized youth soccer programs doubled to 4 million , according to the @entity112 , the governing body for the game in the @entity2			1
while most @entity115 cut their sporting teeth on football , basketball and baseball , today 's young adults are arguably the first generation to grow up with soccer as a major sport in their lives from their earliest childhood memories			1
it 's a widely shared experience among today 's young adults			0
today , soccer is the second favorite sport for those 12 to 24 years old			1
it 's the third largest participation sport in the country			2
soccer is the team sport with the highest growth rate over the past decade			1
that 41 % of players are women only broadens its appeal			0
@entity2 teams performing increasingly well on the international stage has n't hurt either			0
the @entity2 men 's national team has qualified for seven consecutive @entity141			0
our women 's national team is ranked no. 1 in the world			0
while interest naturally peaks among aficionados and novices alike during a mega event like the @entity10 , and subsides afterward , this is not a passing fad			1
total attendance at soccer matches in the @entity2 in 2013 exceeded 10 million , according to attendance figures compiled by @entity112			2
our country has become the largest market in the world for international matches , according to the @entity112 , the governing body for the game in the @entity2			0
at the professional level , @entity160 has expanded to 22 markets and there is more soccer on television in the @entity2 than any other country in the world			2
some 2,928 matches from around the world were shown live in 2012			2
tv ratings for the @entity10 have already topped the @entity171 and the @entity172 in @entity80 -- sunday 's game against @entity30 brought in more than 25 million viewers and was the most - watch soccer match in @entity2 history			1
it is a niche no more			0
but we need to make it even more accessible			0
for example , the standard pay - to - play model -- where participation in local leagues can cost parents as much as $ 1,800 per child , not including travel -- has been a barrier to access for children and families in low - income communities			2
the @entity191 is working to provide thousands of children and families in under - resourced communities with easy and affordable access to quality soccer programming and safe places to play			1
not too many years ago , the standard joke was that soccer was the game of the future -- and always would be			2
well , it seems the future is finally here and it 's here to stay			0
join us on @entity207 / @entity206 .			0
