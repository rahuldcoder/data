@entity0 -- bring back the ban on assault weapons , or tighten enforcement of existing gun control laws and regulations ? those were two options for strengthening gun control offered sunday by @entity9 in the wake of the @entity12 , @entity13 , shootings last week that killed six people and wounded 13 , including @entity9 rep. @entity15			1
the limited range of ideas showed the power of the pro-gun lobby in @entity0 , with @entity9 sen. @entity20 of @entity21 acknowledging that passing any gun control legislation was " hard			1
" " let 's be honest here -- there have n't been the votes in the @entity30 for gun control , " @entity20 told the @entity24 program " @entity25			1
" while outgoing @entity9 gov. @entity31 of @entity32 called for restoring the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 , @entity20 instead proposed " looking for things where we can maybe find some common ground and get something done			1
" republicans stuck to their traditional pro-gun stance , arguing that the @entity12 incident involved a mentally unstable assailant rather than a symptom of lax gun control laws			1
" if you have somebody that is a criminal , that wants to get around the law , they 're going to get around the law , " @entity44 sen. @entity44 of @entity45 said on the @entity24 program			0
" the problem with gun laws is they limit the ability to defend yourself , one			1
but number two , is that people who are going to commit a crime or going to do something crazy are n't going to pay attention to the laws in the first place			2
" possible steps outlined by @entity20 and other @entity9 included limiting to 10 the number of rounds for ammunition magazines in semi-automatic weapons like the one used in the @entity12 shootings , which had magazines holding more than 30 rounds			1
the 10 - round limit was part of the assault weapons ban , which was passed in 1994 under @entity9 president @entity76 and allowed to expire 10 years later under @entity78 president @entity77			1
@entity20 also called for stronger steps to prevent mentally ill people from purchasing guns , and ensuring that the military notifies the @entity83 when it rejects candidates based on excessive drug use			2
he said @entity12 shooting suspect @entity86 was rejected for military service because of excessive drug use			0
" by law that 's on the books , he should not have been allowed to buy a gun , but the law does n't require the military to notify the @entity83 about that , " @entity20 said			2
" in this case , they did n't			0
" @entity20 defended both the constitutional right to bear arms , as well as the power of @entity30 to put some limits on weapon ownership and use			2
" there is a right to bear arms			0
it 's in the @entity106			0
and you ca n't ignore it , just like you ca n't ignore the others , " @entity20 said			2
" but like all the other rights , it 's not absolute			0
" citing the success of previous gun control efforts , @entity20 said that " smart , rational gun control laws that protect the right to bear arms , but have reasonable limits are the way to go			1
" @entity44 , however , said approaching the @entity12 shootings as a gun control issue would miss the central problem -- the failure to properly intervene in a case of obvious mental instability			1
former @entity21 mayor @entity125 , a possible @entity78 presidential contender in 2012 , made the same point on the @entity128 program " @entity129			0
" " it would seem to me that you 'd address this with the most relevant problem first , " @entity125 said			0
" the most relevant problem was the lack of an ability to deal with what was apparently paranoid schizophrenia that should have been treated			0
" he also said political civility must return so that a legitimate debate on gun control could ensue , free of the hyper - partisanship emblematic of @entity0			2
" i think we could take a look at gun laws and see what can be done that does n't affect the constitutional rights that people have to have guns , the right they have to protect themselves , " @entity125 said			1
" i mean , there are people that would argue that , if more people had guns , this may not have happened because somebody might have been able to take action immediately and stop him before he inflicted either damage or as much damage as he did			0
" on the same program , @entity31 also said the issue required a thorough and reasoned debate free from excessive politicking			0
" we need a rational discussion on guns where we put aside the pressure from interest groups and we take a look and say , does any citizen protecting themselves or their home or using a handgun to hunt , do they need a clip that has 33 bullets in it ? " @entity31 said , adding that in his mind , the answer was no. " i think the nation 's spirits would be lifted if the @entity30 acted quickly with the president and reinstated the assault weapons ban , which also had the ban on these large magazines , these clips that carried 30 - plus bullets , " @entity31 added .			0

stiff *resistance* to gun control remains despite the 6 killed and 13 wounded
@entity9 sen. @entity20 : " there have n't been the votes in @entity30 "
@entity78 cite failure to detect mental illness , not lax gun laws
