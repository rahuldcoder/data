-- to those of my fellow evangelicals who are on the religious right , please , stop your fake trumpeting of biblical values if you 're going to run roughshod over your biblical convictions and let your partisan views take center stage			2
when @entity13 was running for the @entity15 presidential nomination , many on the religious right were highly critical of his faith			2
the @entity17 and the @entity18 characterized @entity19 as a cult			2
but @entity22 's association scrubbed that view from its website in the wake of the rev. @entity22 meeting with @entity13			1
and at least one prominent @entity17 leader who called @entity19 a cult has put that aside in order to endorse the @entity15 nominee			1
@entity22 's group removes mormon cult reference from website after @entity13 @entity22 , " @entity41 's pastor , " has run full - page ads in national newspapers like the @entity37 and @entity38 that are thinly veiled endorsements of @entity13			1
in them , he shows he has forgotten big portions of biblical teaching			0
the ads read : " i believe it is vitally important that we cast our ballots for candidates who base their decisions on biblical principles and support the nation of @entity53			0
i urge you to vote for those who protect the sanctity of life and support the biblical definition of marriage between a man and a woman			0
" in a similar full - page ad that ran in @entity64 's @entity63 on sunday , @entity22 said : " we are at a crossroads and there are profound moral issues at stake			1
... please join me in praying for @entity41 , that we will turn out hearts back toward @entity70			0
" @entity22 is urging @entity41 to vote for candidates who base their decisions on " biblical principles , " " support the nation of @entity53 , " " protect the sanctity of life , " and " support the biblical definition of marriage between a man and a woman			1
the teachings of @entity81 are filled with examples of him helping the needy , feeding the hungry , healing the sick and wounded , and taking the haves to task for ignoring the have - nots			2
the @entity89 talks about @entity81 spending his time with social outcasts and not basking in the glow of the 1 %			2
so , rev. @entity22 , why no mention of the poor , sick or needy in your newspaper ads ? @entity22 , and so many others on the religious right , apparently want to narrow the @entity89 's teachings down to only abortion and same - sex marriage			1
does the rest of the @entity89 matter , or are we to tell @entity89 believers that one or two issues matter more than any other ? i know the history of the @entity18 , as well as @entity22 's son @entity108 , helping the needy through @entity110			1
but is n't it worth mentioning and advocating these issues to our presidential candidates ? i wonder how catholic bishops and nuns feel about @entity22 not advocating that @entity89 believers cast their ballots on the issue of health care ? should @entity89 believers not be concerned with rep. @entity121 's proposals to massively cut programs that help the poor ? @entity0 's @entity124 : the faith angles behind the biggest stories should @entity89 believers know about the fatherhood initiative launched by president @entity128 to shore up families and to confront the crisis of fatherless homes ? should @entity89 believers be concerned about the candidates ' stance on guns and gun violence ? is that not a biblical issue , rev. @entity22 ? should @entity89 believers be concerned about who prefers to end wars across the globe ? should @entity89 believers vote on who is best able to tear down the ` - industrial complex that is destroying this country fiscally ? should @entity89 believers know who is more concerned about the rich getting richer ? seriously , rev. @entity22 , are these not moral issues that should be considered ? what has happened over the last 30 years is the religious right has perverted the @entity89 to fit its narrow view of what @entity149 should pay attention to			1
well , my @entity89 is bigger than that			0
my faith is bigger than that			0
and my @entity81 cares about more than abortion and homosexuality			1
please , make your case about those two issues			0
but do n't talk to me , rev. @entity22 , @entity163 , or any other right - wing evangelical , about the sanctity of life when you are silent about such things as @entity168 being gunned down or police brutality taking the lives of innocent @entity41			1
i refuse to think the biblical and social justice issues touted by the @entity173			0
dr. @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , and countless other pastors during the civil rights movement are n't worth considering today			0
support who you want , rev. @entity22 , but do n't dare limit the biblical values to what i can count on one hand			0
the gospel according to @entity128 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			0

@entity188 : those on the religious right have *changed* their views to support @entity13
@entity22 's group once called @entity19 a cult , but has dropped the reference
the religious right is *boiling* the @entity89 down to only abortion and same - sex marriage , he says
@entity168 : @entity81 cares about the poor and the sick . why no mention of those issues ?
