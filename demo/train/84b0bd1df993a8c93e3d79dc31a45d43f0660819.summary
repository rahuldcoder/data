" " discourse on @entity7 is geared towards simplicity , " explains @entity1			1
" everything must be simple , ' he 's a poor black man , he 's a victim , ' like there has to be a simple story , in a way this is what signifies @entity7 and global consciousness , " he adds			1
" the moment you bring a degree of complexity to it , it kind of throws people off , they just do n't know where to look anymore , it 's like , ' what 's going on ? ' so @entity14 in a way does not try to maintain the superficiality of this narrative -- we engage with life , we try to present life as complex as it really is			2
" the pages of the literary magazine , which has more than 100 contributors , offer its readers a variety of thoughtful content , ranging from in - depth investigation stories and analyses to poetry and photographic essays			1
the journal is available online , while hard copies are distributed throughout @entity7 , @entity66 , the @entity67 and @entity68			1

it was recently described by a writer in the @entity84 's @entity83 as " better than @entity85			0
" " there 's a feeling about writing something , sharing something that is beautiful and truthful from one 's perspective , of course , and important , urgent almost that we demand from the contributors , " says @entity1			1
" we ask them to put themselves on the line , so to speak , as if it really matters -- not for the check that may arrive or may not , but because he matters and because he cares about what he 's writing , whether it 's music , boxing , theory , analysis , does matter , to them at least			0
" @entity14 recently received a much needed cash injection after winning the prestigious @entity108 , given annually to individuals , groups and organizations for their outstanding achievements in the field of culture and development			2

for a publication whose survival is wholly dependent on funding , the 100,000 euro prize money was a welcome bonus			0
" i take that of course with great honor , " says @entity1			2
" i also take the check that comes with it because it 's very useful to be able to plan a little bit ahead			0
but ... we 're trying to develop our own measuring stick for excellence -- at the moment this kind of validation , and we appreciate it and we take it , we 're part of a world , but it 's very important that we develop our own measure for excellence			0

" at some point music was a vehicle recognized by people for ideas , for subversive ideas , for revolutionary ideas , it was n't just produced for entertainment , it had a very important role in the struggle , " he says			0
" in this country , that 's very well known , how not just music , but creativity as a whole , arts as a whole , was used as a tool for liberation			0

he says it was important to re-tell the story to fill the historical gaps while re-examining the context and complexity of xenophobic violence			0
