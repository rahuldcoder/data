-- @entity1 became the first @entity3 soccer club to be owned by foreign investors on saturday when an @entity6 group completed its takeover of the @entity9 side			1
the consortium is headed by @entity11 , a partner of the @entity13 group which owns @entity15 club @entity14 and @entity6 baseball team the @entity16			1
he and his cohorts will have a 60 % stake , with the remainder held by @entity22 - based @entity21 banking organization @entity20 -- which bought the club when president @entity24 last year decided she wanted to sell up			1
" the business aspect has been very important but i love @entity30 and i want to do something big for this city , " @entity11 told reporters in quotes carried by the @entity28 @entity27			2
" i am proud of my @entity3 origins and for this reason i will do big things			2
i did n't expect so much attention			0
" i knew of the great passion from the @entity39 and this has been one of the reasons for doing this			0
" i share this passion			0
i never played but my father played in the @entity45			0
" founded in 1927 , the club -- nicknamed " @entity48 " ( @entity49 ) after the team colors -- has been listed on the stock exchange since 2000			0
its website lists its share capital as almost â‚¬ 20 million ( $ 28.9 million )			0
the @entity24 family had been owners for 18 years , and in 2009 announced plans to move away from the @entity57 and build a new 55,000 - capacity ground in the western suburbs of @entity30 which have yet to come to fruition			2
buoyed by the news , @entity1 went in saturday 's home match against @entity62 in sixth place in the table , 12 points behind leaders @entity67 with six rounds to play			1
but it ended in a defeat that dented the team 's @entity21 hopes for next season despite the @entity73 taking a 19th - minute lead through the club 's veteran top scorer @entity75 , with the captain netting from the penalty spot			1
however , @entity79 leveled just before halftime also from a penalty after he was fouled , and 20 - year - old @entity83 striker @entity82 scored twice in the last seven minutes before @entity85 's late consolation for @entity1			1
@entity67 moved six points clear at the top with a 3 - 0 victory at home to 17th - placed @entity90 later in the evening			1
veteran @entity93 midfielder @entity92 opened the scoring in the 20th minute with a freekick driven across the goal into the bottom corner , striker @entity91 netted a penalty nine minutes after halftime and @entity101 forward @entity100 sealed it on 61			0
@entity90 will drop into the bottom three if @entity102 beat bottom club @entity103 on sunday , or @entity105 win at @entity106			2
@entity109 can reduce the deficit to three again by winning at home to fifth - placed @entity112 on sunday , after which there will be five rounds to play			2
third - placed defending champions @entity114 dropped eight points behind their arch - rivals after a 2 - 0 loss at lowly @entity118 , who moved four points clear of the relegation zone			1
@entity122 put @entity118 ahead in the 36th minute and @entity123 -- another striker on loan from @entity125 -- made it safe with four minutes to play			0
it capped a miserable week for @entity114 , whose @entity129 title defense ended with a 7 - 3 aggregate quarterfinal defeat against @entity132 .			0

@entity6 group becomes first foreign owner of an @entity3 *football* club , *buying* out @entity1
@entity11 heads consortium which will have a 60 % holding in @entity9 side
