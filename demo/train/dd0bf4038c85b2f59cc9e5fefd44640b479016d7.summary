@entity0 -- something about the redness of the red ribbon continues to haunt me			2
i have had many dreams of it : one is a bonfire of ribbons			2
@entity10 like blood , red like passion and anger , and red like love			2
that 's how long it has been since the @entity18 created what they called " the @entity20			2
" these @entity0 artists were compelled to collaboratively create a symbol that was easy to reproduce , that would be cheap , and that would make people think about @entity25			1
today we know their work simply as the @entity28 ; an icon that became most poignant at the height of the @entity25 crisis			1
in 1991 , the downtown arts scene was also an unimaginable scene of devastation			2
@entity25 changed contemporary art , and world culture , forever			1
a multitude of talented people had already died and scores more were ill. or caring for dying friends , or working collectively as groundbreaking @entity25 activists			1
some were doing it all			2
and in a series of meetings in april and may of 1991 members of the @entity18 decided that a piece of grosgrain ribbon , twisted in a simple loop and hand - stitched to a gold safety pin , would be an appropriate icon to show support and compassion for those with @entity25 and their caregivers			1
30 years of @entity25 moments to remember when asked about whether a ribbon was enough , the late @entity57 , executive director of @entity58 , who along with @entity59 of equity fights @entity25 worked immediately with @entity25 to place them in the public , said , " i never want this to seem like anything more than visibility			1
the ribbon does not feed people or protect them from discrimination or provide leadership or a cure			2
but it is , at least , an easy first step			2
" founding @entity25 executive director @entity74 was quoted the same year in the @entity75 , " people want to say something , not necessarily with anger and confrontation all the time			1
and even if it is only an easy first step , that 's great with me			0
it wo n't be their last			0
" marking the 20th anniversary of the creation of the red ribbon for @entity25 is an acknowledgment of the merits of art and necessity of artists			1
a small group of people changed the world , with an elegantly simple act			1
we honor their talent , foresight , and dedication in sparking a zeitgeist that pushed the acronyms " @entity107 " and " @entity25 " into everyday speech			1
their story is a source of hope because we now know that advocacy can bring change , but it is also a serious reminder that there is more to be done , because @entity25 is not over			1
@entity25 recently commissioned four artists - @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , and @entity122 -- to create new versions			1
10,000 lapel buttons attached to red ribbons will be distributed beginning of december 1			0
just as the @entity127 did in 1991 , this fall , ribbon bees were held throughout @entity0 at @entity128 , area colleges , @entity130 , and private homes			0
the red ribbon has been copied			0
it is honored as an icon of design and activism transcending language , recognized around the world			1
its creators saw that it would never be copyrighted in the @entity143 , and they emphasized that it should never be made for sale or profit			0
still , it has also been commodified			0
we always hope any profits were used to benefit services for people living with @entity107 , or towards research for a vaccine , treatments , and a cure , or for effective prevention campaigns that emphasis harm reduction , treatment access , and universal health care			0
i found a letter from june 21 , 1991			0
signed by @entity74 , @entity59 , and @entity57 on behalf of " the @entity20 , " it explained that " by wearing the red ribbon we demonstrate compassion for people living with @entity25 ; support of the on - going efforts of their caretakers and service organizations ; and advocacy for a coordinated response from our government for the research that will lead to effective treatments , vaccines , and ultimately , a cure			1
" the work of courageous people did lead to effective treatments			0
twenty years later , my desire for all the other demands that wearing a ribbon once demonstrated remains			0
it must be our collective desire			0
beyond december 1 , we must make @entity189 a part of daily life and in doing so continue to extend safety , dignity , and compassion to all people living with @entity107 ; to honor those we have lost ; to work for a cure that can be shared worldwide ; and to hold our governments accountable to the coordinated responses developed with community input			0
but my dreams of the red ribbon continue			0
it 's certainly the iconic symbol of the @entity25 crisis and now it even resides in the collection of the @entity203 but it is more than a museum piece , it was the first , and remains the most emblematic of all " disease awareness " ribbons			1
its ethos endures as it embodies the greatest of complexities in one elegant form			0
as current social movements and activism seek visual embodiments of our varied messages , its spirit endures			1
but for me , i still see red			0
the opinions in this piece are solely those of @entity223 .			0

this year marks the 20th anniversary of the creation of the " @entity28 " for @entity227
the symbol is an icon of design and activism that is recognized around the world
@entity25 recently commissioned four artists to create *updated* versions
