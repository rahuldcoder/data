-- despite everyone talking about @entity4 's new immigration law , @entity3 , no one has asked if it was @entity4 's best option			1
was there no other approach to address immigration without undermining the state 's economy or shredding our social fabric ? nobody had a better idea for balancing security with the draw and demand of @entity19 jobs ? what about an offer to work with @entity22 ? was the only solution to blow up the place ? it should concern everyone that no one asked these questions			1
if you watch the @entity3 hearings here , not a single legislator asks about or offers alternatives , although a few express " concerns			1
" one legislator , @entity34 , strongly challenged the law 's sponsor , state sen. @entity37 , on his immigration claims			2
@entity34 's courage was rewarded with the loss of his committee assignment			2
@entity37 announced he would run primary challengers against any @entity43 who voted against @entity3			2
he threatened to hold up bills sponsored by anyone who did not support @entity3			2
he was so hell bent on passing his immigration bill that he packed hearings with supporters and , surprise , committee chairs limited the speaking time of opponents			0
even if someone had another idea , the process was set up to ignore it			0
so what hath @entity3 wrought ? distrust			2
there 's the rumored loss of 200,000 to 300,000 convention room bookings for 2011 - 2013			1
there 's damage to @entity4 's reputation			1
@entity70 citizens expect to be racially profiled			0
there 's the potential filing of hundreds of lawsuits against state and local government agencies and big paydays for the lawyers who will try those cases			0
nothing much positive so far -- but it gets worse			0
simple math suggests kicking 300,000 workers out of the state means at least a $ 6 billion hit to @entity4 's economy			1
add those jobs lost in support or supply businesses and the impact could reach $ 29 billion annually			1
do n't expect the law 's proponents to have a plan for replacing those lost billions with anything other than empty promises of thousands of newly available low - paying jobs and overestimated savings -- all based on a flawed report from the @entity97			1
the report ignores that undocumented workers and family members pay the very same property and sales taxes that fund @entity4 's education system and the state 's general fund			1
it ignores the contributions that children who are citizens make to the state 's tax base once they enter the workforce			0
if undocumented worker departures open up jobs , then why is the @entity113 reporting @entity4 's unemployment rate increased every month since @entity3 was signed into law ? the bureau reports that @entity4 lost 11,700 jobs from may to june and unemployment rose to 9.7 percent			1
we see news reports of immigrants leaving all the time , so jobs must be available			0
how can this be ? the fact is , @entity3 is pushing out both the legal and the undocumented			2
they spend money at stores owned by people who are n't leaving			0
those businesses will lay off workers , reduce operations or close			0
that means fewer jobs , increased housing and commercial vacancies , depressed home values and foreclosures , and less sales , property and employment tax revenue for the state			0
we see it happening daily			0
anyone paying attention could have seen this coming			0
unfortunately , few really were			0
the rest were " satisficed " -- a combination of satisfied and sufficed that means settling on any solution rather than an optimal one -- that @entity3 would solve the problem , in glorious denial as to the real damage the bill is doing to @entity4			1
has @entity3 solved any part of the problem ? @entity3 does n't secure the border and the unemployment figures do n't indicate any improvement			2
it has created far more economic and social problems than it solves , but few proponents want to admit that			1
this is the result of not asking , " is there a better way ? " states considering mimicking @entity3 would be wise to heed warnings of adverse economic and social impacts			1
they would be wiser to question the " facts " @entity3 proponents trot out to support similar efforts			2
they would be wisest to say , " what else have you got ? " is there a better way ? how about putting @entity182 - type centers on the borders and channeling everyone looking for work through them ? employers , as in current law , would tell the government what type and how many jobs they need , ones that are n't being filled by domestic workers			1
those jobs would be advertised on the internet , where interested immigrants and @entity19 can compete for them			2
knowing the job demand , @entity22 could set market - based visa quotas that make sense			0
instead of paying coyotes $ 2,500 to be smuggled into the @entity19 , the job seekers would pay @entity201 to expedite the privilege			1
this takes billions out of the hands of smugglers and funds the solution to the problem			0
if 500,000 people are crossing into @entity4 each year , this generates $ 1.25 billion to help cover the costs of building and operating these centers , with access to labor for business and better allocation of @entity218 resources to finding drug smugglers			1
read more about the proposal here			0
@entity222 have lived with political obsession and distortion on immigration for four years and my only suggestion to other states is : do n't follow our lead			0
think of something else , because @entity3 is n't worth the economic and social trouble			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 .			0

@entity236 : nobody considered an alternative to @entity4 's @entity3
kicking 300,000 out , loss of businesses could cost $ 29 billion annually , he writes
he says law has already created far more job , economic , social problems than it solves
@entity236 proposes @entity182 - type centers on the borders that channel job seekers into @entity19
