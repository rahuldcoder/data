-- @entity1 , the president 's top intelligence adviser , announced his resignation after 16 months of power struggles , politics and personality clashes			1
@entity1 was the third person to serve as director of national intelligence since the position was created five years ago			1
his resignation is effective may 28			2
although president @entity10 praised @entity1 for his " remarkable record of service , " there has been tension between the two			1
@entity1 found himself at odds with the @entity15 over the scope of his role , and there was indirect conflict with others in the intelligence community			2
" from the beginning the @entity15 did not have the same view of what the @entity24 should be , " according to a source familiar with the situation			0
" [ @entity1 ] is a manager and a leader			0
he is not a politico			0
he does n't run around doing political stuff , " the source said , acknowledging the @entity1 's candor got him in trouble			1
@entity1 , a retired four - star @entity35 admiral , has served in the post since january 2009			0
his office oversees 17 federal intelligence agencies , including the @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			2
word of his resignation came two days after the @entity44 released a report that sharply criticized the @entity46 , overseen by @entity1 's office , for failing to coordinate properly intelligence activities to detect the attempted @entity50 airline bombing			1
the report highlighted 14 points of failure and said that the center was not organized to fulfill its mission			0
@entity1 , who also caught some of the blame for the more recent failed @entity58 bombing attempt , responded to the report by noting changes made in response to the @entity50 incident , including creation of a @entity46 analytical unit dedicated to following up on terrorist threat information			0
however , @entity1 's statement noted that " institutional and technological barriers remain that prevent seamless sharing of information			1
" although @entity1 's resignation was not a complete surprise for those in the intelligence community , he was not expected to step down for another month , senior intelligence officials said			1
he decided to leave sooner than expected when @entity10 asked cia director @entity77 and national security adviser @entity78 to go to @entity79 and @entity1 was not asked to participate , the sources said			1
" when the president looked to @entity77 and @entity82 to go to @entity79 on this very serious threat , it was a slap at him			2
it was an indication of a lack of confidence in @entity91 , " said @entity84 , @entity0 national security contributor who was president @entity87 's chief anti-terrorism and homeland security adviser			1
one @entity44 source said @entity1 has been unhappy and frustrated			0
" he was losing every turf battle to @entity77 , " the source said			0
@entity1 and @entity10 also did n't have a good connection , @entity84 said			2
" you 've got a very bright , engaged president and with a lot of charisma , and there was n't a real chemistry between them , " she said			1
the @entity24 was intended to be the ceo of the intelligence community , looking at the 17 agencies ' budgets , capabilities , training and cross-department communication			0
when the position was created , the @entity24 was given a lot of responsibility but not enough authority , @entity84 said			0
" it 's clear in this case between adm. @entity1 and president @entity10 there was a mismatch and misunderstanding of expectations and responsibilities			1
and it will be very important that whoever the new @entity24 is , understands and accepts what the president 's view of that position is , " she said			0
even before @entity1 officially turned in his resignation , the @entity15 already had spoken to potential replacements , the senior intelligence officials said			1
@entity138 , a defense official in the @entity140 administration ; retired @entity133 lt. gen. @entity132 , defense undersecretary for intelligence ; and former sen. @entity136 , @entity137 , are considered top contenders			0
@entity0 's @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 contributed to this report .			2

@entity1 's resignation as director of national intelligence effective may 28
@entity1 was n't expected to resign for another month , senior intelligence officials say
president asked @entity39 chief and national security adviser to go on @entity79 trip , not @entity1
@entity0 national security contributor : no " real chemistry " between @entity1 , president @entity10
