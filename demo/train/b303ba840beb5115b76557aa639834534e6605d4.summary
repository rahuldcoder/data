ten planes will fly over 123,167 square miles ( 319,000 square kilometers ) located about 1,150 miles ( 1,850 kilometers ) west of @entity15 , the @entity3 said			0

eight ships will join the search by the end of the day , including the @entity27 @entity26 , which will be fitted with a " black box " detector and an autonomous underwater vehicle , @entity3 said			1
all ships will seek to locate and identify objects sighted by aircraft over the past two days			1
search experts said the clock is ticking			2
@entity36 , a former adviser to the @entity38 @entity37 , said on @entity2 that the batteries on the flight data recorder , sometimes called the black box , are designed to last only about 30 days			0
the plane disappeared march 8 -- three weeks ago			1
eight planes and a number of ships scoured some 97,000 square miles of water saturday for signs of the plane , with aircraft reporting sightings of objects similar to those reported friday , the @entity3 said			1
two vessels -- one of them a @entity9 warship -- retrieved objects , " but so far no objects confirmed to be related to @entity5 have been recovered , " the authority said			1
crew members aboard a @entity9 plane dropped buoys to mark three suspected debris sites , @entity9 's state - run @entity58 reported			1
" after entering the search area , the airlifter flew for about 20 minutes , " crew member @entity63 told the television network			1
" we found an l - shaped debris in orange color right below the plane 's right wing			1
then within around three minutes , we found a stripe - shaped object			0
we immediately reported our findings to the captain			0
" the captain , @entity75 , said buoys containing dye were dropped on each of the suspected sites , according to @entity58			0
relatives complaining relatives of the 239 people on board the plane have complained about receiving mixed messages			2
earlier this week , they heard this : " all lives are lost			0
" but saturday , a @entity1 official met with relatives and then told reporters he had not closed the door on the hope of relatives that survivors may exist among the 239 people aboard the @entity96 that went missing march 8			1
" even hoping against hope , no matter how remote , of course , we are praying and we will continue our search for the possible survivors , " said @entity98 , @entity1 's acting transportation minister			1
" more than that , i told the families i can not give them false hope			1
the best we can do is pray and that we must be sensitive to them that , as long as there is even a remote chance of a survivor , we will pray and do whatever it takes			0
" @entity9 relatives in @entity0 told @entity2 that @entity1 authorities are restricting their movement and access to information when a briefing for them was not held saturday , the @entity9 relatives said they were deterred from attending a briefing for @entity123 relatives			1
they ended up talking to a @entity125 official after the briefing			2
' they 're still alive ' in @entity131 on saturday , some of the relatives of the missing vented their anguish in the streets			2
" they 're all still alive , my son and everyone on board ! " yelled @entity134 , 63 , whose only son was among the passengers			0
" the plane is still there , too ! they 're hiding it			2
" he held aloft a banner that read : " son , mom and dad 's hearts are torn to pieces			0
come home soon ! " many relatives doubtless remember the speculation from early in the search that the plane may have landed somewhere			2
they implored @entity98 to redouble the efforts , and he said @entity1 authorities would do so			2
" what they want is a commitment on our part to continue the search , and that i have given , " @entity98 said			2
" for me , as the minister responsible , this is the hardest part of my life , at the moment , " he told reporters			0
" miracles do happen , remote or otherwise , and that is the hope that the families want me to convey -- not only to the @entity1 government , @entity125 ( @entity125 ) , but also to the world at large , " he said			1
he said the effort was still to find survivors			0
sea objects on saturday that meant hunting again for plane debris in an ocean awash in debris -- including odds and ends from passing ships -- in hopes that among it are pieces of the jet			1
after the latest data analysis , experts says they believe that @entity5 , which disappeared three weeks ago , ended up in the southern @entity189			1
investigators concluded this week that , during the flight 's initial phase , the plane was traveling faster -- and therefore burning fuel faster -- than they had thought			0
authorities have concluded that it could not have traveled as far south as they had thought earlier			0
the new search area is 1,100 kilometers ( 680 miles ) northeast of the previous one and closer to @entity27 's coast , so it 's easier to reach			1
it 's also marked by calmer waters			0
ships plowed the waters of the search area and eight planes searched from above			2
" unfortunately , we did n't find anything of significance out there , " flight captain @entity206 said after returning to @entity15			0
@entity1 plane saga : your questions answered pieces of debris spotted friday were hundreds of miles away from each other , but given the ocean conditions and the time passed since the airplane 's purported crash , they could be part of the same object			1
friday 's sightings included 11 small objects spotted by a military p - 3 plane			2
@entity2 's @entity227 , who went out on a @entity229 p - 8 search plane friday , said its crew spotted white objects , orange rope and a blue bag			1
" at one point , sure , everybody on board got a little excited , but it 's impossible to tell from that distance what anything is , " she said			0
if and when the jet is found , the key question would remain : why did it go down ? that may not be answered until investigators retrieve the aircraft and try , literally , to piece together what happened to it			0
vast , shifting search the shifting hunt for flight 370 has spanned vast bodies of water and continents			0
it started in the @entity256 between @entity1 and @entity257 , where the plane went out of contact with air traffic controllers			1
when authorities learned of radar data suggesting the plane had turned westward across the @entity264 after losing contact , they expanded the search into the @entity266			2
when those efforts proved fruitless , the search spread north into the @entity269 and northern @entity189			0
it then ballooned dramatically after @entity1 announced march 15 that satellite data showed the plane could have flown along either of two huge arcs , one stretching northwest into the @entity274 land mass , the other southwest into the @entity189			1
the search area at that point reached nearly 3 million square miles			0
@entity1 prime minister @entity278 said that further analysis of the data led authorities to conclude the plane went down in the southern @entity189 , far from land			1
@entity1 officials then told the families of those on board that nobody would have survived			1
on saturday , after confronting relatives ' grief , they made that conclusion seem less final			0
' unspeakable challenge ' for families mystery surfaces pain of 1977 tragedy questions linger did flammable cargo doom flight ? how they 're searching for debris @entity2 's @entity299 and @entity300 reported and wrote from @entity301 , and @entity302 from @entity0			2
@entity303 contributed to this report .			0

the search resumes , but *bad* weather a threat

@entity1 official : " i told the families i can not give them false hope "
