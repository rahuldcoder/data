amid growing foreign policy crises , president @entity0 is encouraging @entity2 and the country to focus on issues here at home -- namely how to improve the livelihoods of working families			1
on monday , the president and first lady @entity9 will hold a @entity10 in @entity11 , which highlights economic issues affecting @entity14 families at home and in the workplace			1
" every single day , there are conversations around the kitchen table where people are trying to figure out , this child care is costing so much , i 'm not sure that we 're going to be able to make our mortgage at the end of the month , " the president said to @entity17 of @entity19 's " @entity18			1
" " there are folks who are saying , ' @entity31 is sick , but if i do n't show up at my job , because i do n't have paid family leave , we 're not going to be able to pay the electricity bill			1
' " @entity17 sat down with the president on friday to discuss how he plans to achieve his administration 's goal of a " 21st - century workplace that works for all @entity14			1
" here are the five things we learned from our sitdown with the president : 1			2
the goal of the summit is ... " ... to lift up the conversation that everybody is already having individually and let people know you 're not alone out here , " @entity0 said			1
the president said he believes " good , strong , healthy families " are the foundation of our society			1
but today , according to @entity0 , those working families are struggling to get by as parents are having difficulty juggling their obligations at home and work			1
" and if that 's the case , it 's not just about giving lip service to it , " he said			2
" we 've got to reduce the stresses on families			2
and i think if you ask most families around the country , ' what 's the biggest stress ? ' it has to do with financial pressures and time pressures that are constantly encroaching on them			1
president @entity0 's three priorities at the @entity10 : priority one : paid family leave according to a survey from the @entity84 ' labor agency , of the 185 countries and territories with readily available information , only three do not provide paid maternity leave			1
and , you guessed it , the @entity14 made that list			0
the other two countries are @entity93 and @entity94			0
" paid family leave , we 're the only advanced country on @entity99 that does n't have it , " the president said			1
" it does n't make any sense			0
there are a lot of countries that are a lot poorer than we are that also have it			0
" but the president said paid family leave is n't just a women 's issue , as he reflected on his days of becoming a new working dad			1
" one of the most precious memories that i 'll ever have is when my first daughter , @entity116 , was born , " he said			0
" i was lucky enough that my schedule allowed me to take that first month off			0
and staying up until 2 in the morning and feeding her and burping her creates a bond that is irreplaceable			0
" right now in the @entity14 , employees can take 12 weeks of unpaid leave under the @entity122			2
employers can choose to provide paid leave , but less than half do			1
according to a 2012 survey from the @entity127 , 48 % of employees who went on leave received full pay , while 17 % received only partial pay			2
" we have unpaid family leave right now , but for a whole lot of families , it means they ca n't use it because they just ca n't afford it , " @entity0 said			1
@entity137 : is paid family leave bad for business ? priority two : workplace flexibility the president said he 's pushing for workplace flexibility to give parents the opportunity to become more involved in their children 's lives and education			1
" we always say that we want parents involved in our kids ' education , " he said			2
" there are millions of families out there who ca n't even imagine taking time off to go to a parent - teacher conference			2
" this type of workplace flexibility is a practice that he and the first lady believe will improve employee morale and motivation			1
" when we knew that employers had our backs and were willing to give us flexibility to look after family , that made us want to work harder for that employer , " he said			2
" even if it meant taking work home with us , if it meant coming in on saturday to replace the time we had taken off on tuesday			0
and that , i think , has been the experience of a lot of employers			0
" priority three : child care @entity0 administration officials say they are focusing on the issue of child care at monday 's summit			1
@entity185 senior adviser @entity184 cited a survey that found that over a three - month stretch , 29 % of working parents had a child care emergency			1
" what happens if you 've got to leave in the middle of the day ? if you are a low - wage worker and you leave , you could lose your job , " @entity193 said in an interview on @entity196 's " @entity195			1
" " we do n't do a very good job providing high - quality , affordable child care , and there are a lot of countries , a lot of our competitors do it , " @entity0 told @entity17			1
" that means that it 's a lot easier for women to be in the workforce and not have to make choices that ultimately mean they 're , in some cases , getting paid less or having less opportunities			1
and it also means , by the way , that our kids are more likely to thrive			0
add to that list : equal pay for equal work			0
women now make up more than half of the country 's primary or co-breadwinners			2
but the @entity0 administration says those women are still earning less than their male counterparts			1
a 2013 @entity230 study said women earned 84 % of what men earned , according to an analysis of hourly wages of all workers			0
" we 've done some things administratively on that front			0
i always say that should n't be a women 's issue because i always wanted @entity9 to make sure that she was getting paid fairly because when she brought her paycheck home , that went into the overall pot to help us pay our bills , " the president said			1
what the president is going to do about it : @entity0 says he has full faith that these best practices of offering paid family leave and workplace flexibility will garner a more productive and competitive economic landscape			1
" for companies who are offering paid family leave , who are offering flexibility , their workers are more productive , more loyal , " he said			1
" there 's lower turnover and ultimately , they 're going to be more profitable			0
" monday 's summit is just one step toward his second - term agenda of improving these domestic issues			2
" i 'm going to be taking some action , a presidential memorandum directing every federal agency to be very clear to their employees that it is my view that offering flexibility where possible is the right thing to do			0
we do n't want people having to choose between family and work when you 've got an emergency situation , " @entity0 said			2
but @entity283 have been critical of what they perceive as initiatives that are derived solely from the president 's midterm election strategy of mobilizing women to turn out to vote			2
with @entity289 holding the upper hand on women 's issues , the @entity10 plays into the party 's strength , leading administration critics to wonder if this is just about playing politics			0
" i 've got a strong , successful wife , who i remember being reduced to tears sometimes because she could n't figure out how to juggle everything that she was doing			0
and i 've got two daughters that i care about more than anything in the world , " the president said			0
" and so this is personal for me			0
and i think it 's personal for a lot of people			0
" " this is not just a women 's issue			2
this is a middle - class issue and an @entity14 issue , " he continued			0
" and to the extent that we want to have this conversation outside of politics , i 'd welcome a bipartisan effort with ideas coming from the private sector and from @entity283 , from @entity289 and from nonprofits and the faith community about how we make sure that we 're supporting families and reducing their stress			0
his tips on parenting : with @entity17 's first baby on the way , she asked the president for some parenting advice			1
" you know , you 're going to do great , " @entity0 said			2
" @entity9 and i talk about this			1
and kids are more resilient than you realize			0
you give them unconditional love and then you give them some structure and some rules			0
and they usually turn out really , really well			0
and they 'll bring you a lot of joy			0
" some of those structures and rules fall directly in line with the president 's second - term agenda , by homing in on the issue of minimum wage			1
both the president and the first lady told @entity352 that they worked minimum - wage jobs -- an experience they want for their daughters , @entity116 , 15 , and @entity356 , 13			2
" i think every kid needs to get a taste of what it 's like to do that real hard work , " @entity9 told @entity352			1
" we are looking for opportunities for them to feel as if going to work and getting a paycheck is not always fun , not always stimulating , not always fair			0
but that 's what most folks go through every single day , " president @entity0 added			1
@entity116 is turning 16 on july 4 , a milestone marked by her getting her first job on a @entity372 set as a production assistant and soon prepping for her driver 's license			0
@entity0 reflects on the years gone by , raising his girls in the @entity185			2
" we were pretty big believers in , as soon as they could understand words , you start giving them some assignments : eat your peas , pick up the toys off the floor			0
and by the time they 're 16 , they turn out pretty good , although they do n't always give you as much time with them as you want , " he said			0
