the two illustrated figures on the flag were @entity71 , an @entity67 nationalist who led uprisings against the @entity4 and @entity73 in 1912 and 1913 , while the other , @entity74 , is considered to be the founder of the modern @entity67 state , which became independent in 1912			1
the word " @entity81 , " which refers to an indigenous inhabitant of a place , was emblazoned at the bottom of the flag and is considered an offense to @entity4			1

@entity67 prime minister @entity119 had been scheduled to visit @entity9 on october 22 -- the first such visit by an @entity67 leader in 68 years			0

" there is no reference in the official reports that emptying the stadium was the proper way to restore the security conditions			0
