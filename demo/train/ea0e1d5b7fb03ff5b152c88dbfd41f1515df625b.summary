when @entity2 left home in 2013 , his parents thought he was going to help out at a refugee camp for the victims of @entity7 's brutal civil war			1
but the soft - spoken @entity9 student was n't on a humanitarian mission -- he had joined the ranks of a jihadist brigade fighting to topple @entity7 president @entity13			1
but @entity2 -- whose name has been changed to conceal his identity -- soon realized that what he was seeing on the battlefield was different from what he thought he 'd signed up for			0
" the place i was in , there was some chaos between different groups and there was violence between different groups , " @entity2 , who is in his early twenties , told @entity20			0
" i went there to fight @entity13 and not to fight other @entity30 groups			0
" @entity2 did n't want to be a part of that			0
@entity34 up with the infighting , he decided to return home			0
in 2013 , a @entity37 - sponsored panel declared @entity9 the world 's happiest place to live , citing a number of factors including life expectancy , social support and the freedom to make life choices			1
but the wealthy @entity47 country is also becoming known for something altogether more worrying -- one of @entity51 's highest rates of jihadi fighters			1
at least 100 @entity9 are believed to have left the country to fight in @entity7 and @entity54			1
of 25 countries @entity20 surveyed last month , only three had a higher proportion of @entity57 leaving to fight			0
the country is facing a dilemma : what to do when these fighters come home ? @entity63 , @entity9 's second largest city , thinks it has the answer -- a controversial program for rehabilitating jihadis returning home from @entity7 that does n't necessarily involve jail time			1
here 's how the program works : any returning fighter is eligible for help getting a job , a house , an education , and psychological counseling -- just like any other @entity9 citizen			1
those returning must be screened by police , and anyone found to have committed a crime will be put through the courts and possibly prison			0
the program does not try to change the fundamentalist beliefs of the returning fighters -- as long as they do n't advocate violence			1
watch : how @entity9 's de-radicalization program works @entity63 seems to have an especially acute problem with foreign fighters			1
more than 30 young people -- including @entity2 -- left the city last year to fight in @entity7			1
sixteen of them have since returned			0
@entity2 was pursuing an engineering degree at university before he went to @entity7			1
he has been there twice since			0
@entity2 said he was n't nervous about coming back home			0
unlike in some other countries , it is not a crime in @entity9 to fight in @entity7			1
" it was n't illegal to fight in @entity7 unless you fought for a group that was a terrorist organization , " @entity2 explained			2
" it was not a big deal for me to come back and get back to the daily life i had before i left			0
" @entity2 knows the people who run the de-radicalization program , but he has n't joined it because he does n't think he needs help reintegrating into society			1
but some of friends have joined the program and are satisfied with it			0
police here say it 's a @entity9 solution that 's not particularly special -- it 's simply a crime prevention program with a focus on jihadis			1
" we ca n't just put young people in custody because they plan to go to @entity7 , " explained @entity63 police commissioner @entity122			2
" it is not illegal according to @entity9 law to go to @entity7 , but we could try to persuade the young people not to go to @entity7			1
" " we could tell them about the risks that they might encounter going to @entity7			2
we could tell them about the @entity9 legislation that makes it illegal to participate in direct terrorist acts and if they did do they might be punished when they come back			2
we could offer the parents and young people the mentoring help or help from psychologists in order to get some tools in how to deal with this problem			0
" of the roughly 30 people that left @entity63 for @entity7 last year , 22 had some sort of association with the city 's @entity148 , according to @entity122			1
sixteen have since returned back to @entity9			2
watch : why are there so many jihadis from @entity9 ? the mosque has come under severe criticism from right - wing @entity9 politicians who say @entity157 's leaders are trying to radicalize their followers			1
some have even called for the mosque to be closed down			0
mosque officials told @entity20 they were surprised that so many of their members had left for @entity7 -- but said they had been working with police on the best way to approach young @entity57			1
" the only and the most important thing that we want to see is that they do n't consider us as criminals , " said @entity165 , the mosque 's chairman			0
" they do n't consider us as terrorists , and they recognize us as minority living in @entity9 and will continue living in @entity9 and that we are a part of this society			2
" @entity165 said young people from his mosque started traveling to @entity7 because they wanted to make a difference			2
and @entity165 refused to condemn the brutality of the radical @entity181 groups -- like @entity182 and @entity183 -- that are running rampant in the war - torn country			0
" we are here in @entity9 , so far away from the area around there , " he told @entity20			2
" we are not condemning or supporting any group down there because we do n't have the information			0
" @entity165 said that jihadis returning to @entity9 were probably turned off by the infighting between the various @entity30 groups battling for control of @entity7 , or that they simply wanted to return to a more normal life of school and work			1
the @entity9 program lies in stark contrast to the approach of the @entity201			1
fighters returning to @entity201 often face surveillance , terror charges , and jail time			1
officials say that roughly 500 people living in the @entity201 have left to fight in @entity7 and @entity54			1
@entity201 is also looking at measures to ban fighters from returning home under the @entity211 ( @entity212 )			1
there is fear that returning fighters might carry out terror activity at home			1
watch : is de-radicalization possible in @entity201 ? @entity2 criticized @entity201 's approach to returning jihadis			1
" the @entity201 government treat the people in a harsh way compared to @entity9 , " he said			1
" they start taking away people 's passports and start harassing them by raiding their homes , taking some of them to prison and these things			0
" " i have spoken to a lot of @entity233 people in @entity7 and nobody has ever talked about getting back to plan to bomb these countries , as they try to make it sound like in the media			2
" there are several de-radicalization programs in the @entity201 -- mostly aimed at preventing people already in @entity201 from becoming radicalized -- but none specifically targeted towards citizens returning from @entity7			1
in 2008 , the @entity201 government spent £ 140 million on countering extremism			2
that has now dwindled to just £ 1.7 million			0
a spokesman for @entity201 's @entity247 told @entity20 : " we take the risk of those returning from @entity7 very seriously			1
some of these people may have been exposed to traumatic experiences and others may be radicalised or vulnerable to radicalisation			0
" " in the @entity201 we work with our partners , including the police and health service , to determine how we can best support returnees from areas of conflict and help them successfully reintegrate into society			1
" so does the @entity9 method actually work ? @entity122 seems to think so			2
" i should say that in 2014 i can see after we started this contact dialogue with the mosque and the youth center , only one [ person ] to our knowledge has left to @entity7 -- in comparison to 30 in 2013 before we had this contact , " @entity122 said			2
@entity122 said @entity9 fighters have to be motivated to be productive members of society			1
" we see it as a very important crime prevention effort to try to reintegrate these people back into the society , " he said			0
" many of the people who come back , they are rather disillusioned about what they have seen in @entity7			2
it 's not what they had expected or heard or seen over the internet			0
" " what we have seen is out of the 16 that have returned ... 10 of them are now back in school and have a job -- it seems to us that their focus is on something else other than @entity7			2
" @entity293 , a professor of psychology at the @entity296 , has been involved with the city 's program for the last two years , providing counseling to returning fighters			1
he is aware the program might not work for everyone			0
" if [ someone ] does n't want our help , we ca n't really reach him , " he told @entity20			0
" all of these youngsters are screened for criminal acts out there			0
if they have done something like that , then the other part of society -- police enforcement -- will take over			0
" it 's too soon to know whether the program will be a success in the long term			2
but police say the alternative would be fighters that return and simply disappear			0
this program is designed to help while also keeping a close watch			0
" young people have a lot of feelings			0
so if you are going to be humble towards those returned fighters , they will be humble towards you			0
if you are going to be harsh towards them , they are going to be harsh towards you			0
this is how young people think , " @entity2 said			0
in the meantime , @entity2 says he will keep working to complete his education -- and that he plans to go back to @entity7 after graduation .			2

@entity9 has *unveiled* a controversial de-radicalization program for jihadis returning from @entity7
the program offers some returning foreign fighters social support without the threat of jail time
@entity9 has one of the highest proportions of citizens leaving for @entity7 in @entity51
@entity9 program lies in stark contrast to @entity201 's more *punitive* approach to returning fighters
