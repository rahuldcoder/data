-- the dog photos are difficult to view			1
they show man 's best friend being stuffed into wire cages and trucked , illegally , across borders in @entity7			1
the destination : restaurants in @entity10			0
that thought alone -- that someone would sit in a public restaurant and order dog from a menu -- is likely enough to get most " dog people " to stop reading this column , much less look at the photo essay featured this week by @entity0 's photo blog			1
here in the @entity22 , we will spend $ 58.5 billion on pets this year , according to one industry projection			0
we pamper dogs with @entity26 presents ; send them to " doggie daycare " ; bring them on planes ( more than 2 million pets and animals fly per year ) ; and trot them around show rings , judging the perfection of their pedigree			0
we do n't even consider it			0
the images featured on the @entity38 take viewers inside @entity7 's illegal dog - meat trade			1
shot by @entity41 , who traveled to @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity10 for the story , they 're well worth your attention			0
he documents a trade that is estimated to include hundreds of thousands of dogs per year			2
the 36 - year - old was born in the @entity50 and has been living in @entity42 for eight years			2
he told me in an e-mail interview that he considers himself a " dog person " -- " i got an @entity61 sheepdog for my fourth birthday and called him @entity64 " -- and that made it difficult to see the gruesome realities of this trade , which is illegal in @entity42 because the exporters are n't paying taxes or getting the dogs vaccinated			1
" the dogs are illegally smuggled out of @entity42 -- that is the illegal part , " he said			2
" they pay no tax or duty			0
the dogs are n't vaccinated nor do they undergo quarantine			0
but once they get to @entity43 they are legally allowed to travel ... on the way to @entity10 , as the officials are n't interested in it			0
and once in @entity10 no part of it is illegal			2
" in a slaughterhouse , " the dogs were beaten to death in front of me , " he said			0
i fear you 'll see @entity41 's photos and think only one thing : how awful that people in @entity10 would eat these loveable , intelligent animals			1
you 'll do what i did , which is to imagine your dog , or your childhood dog , in one of these cages			2
you wo n't think about the bigger picture			0
which is this : the cruelty of this trade -- the fact that dogs are smashed into cages ; suffocated ; " skinned alive , strung up and beaten , " according to a @entity0 report -- is what should shock and sadden you			1
the fact that people are eating dog meat ? that should n't			1
unless you 're vegetarian or vegan -- i 'm not , by the way , although i do try to eat relatively little meat -- you do n't have any moral high ground to stand on			1
here in the @entity22 , a place with an unhealthy and ridiculously hipster bacon obsession ( witness : bacon donuts , bacon pie , bacon in bloody marys ) , eating dog could be seen as a reasonable alternative to pig , which is another highly intelligent animal , capable of being a companion to the likes of @entity128			1
the @entity22 euthanizes 1.2 million dogs per year , according to the @entity130			0
would eating them be so different ? it actually could be seen as helpful			2
" [ @entity134 ] nlike all farmed meat , which requires the creation and maintenance of animals , dogs are practically begging to be eaten , " @entity139 , a vegetarian and novelist , writes in the book " @entity142			1
" euthanizing pets , he says , " amounts to millions of pounds of meat now being thrown away every year			2
the simple disposal of these euthanized dogs is an enormous ecological and economic problem			0
it would be demented to yank pets from homes			0
but eating those strays , those runaways , those not - quite - cute - enough - to - take and not - quite - well - behaved - enough - to - keep dogs would be killing a flock of birds with one stone and eating it , too			1
" but wait : dogs are companions , right ? pigs ( mostly ) are not			0
in parts of @entity10 , not so much			0
in @entity162 , remember , cows are sacred			0
and eating pig is off limits for many @entity167 and @entity168 people			1
plus , there 's an inherent danger in thinking that " the value of an animal depends on how you treat it , " writes @entity172 's @entity171			1
" if you befriend it , it 's a friend			2
if you raise it for food , it 's food , " he says in a 2002 essay , hilariously titled " @entity182			1
" " this relativism is more dangerous than the absolutism of vegetarians or even of thoughtful carnivores			0
you can abstain from meat because you believe that the mental capacity of animals is too close to that of humans			2
you can eat meat because you believe that it is n't			1
either way , you 're using a fixed standard			0
but if you refuse to eat only the meat of ' companion ' animals -- chewing bacon , for example , while telling @entity205 that they ca n't stew @entity206 -- you 're saying that the morality of killing depends on habit or even whim			1
" maybe the logic of that makes sense but the thought of eating dog still does n't sit well			1
that 's the case for me			2
i went to @entity10 earlier this year to report a story on the illegal trade in pangolin , which is a scale - covered mammal few people care about ( except me and maybe this guy ) in the way they care about dogs			1
i saw dog restaurants in @entity226			2
easily could have gone to one			0
and that says less about the dog - eating that 's going on in @entity226 than my own conflicted eating habits			1
clearly , the illegal dog trade needs to be cleaned up			1
but so does our thinking about what we eat and when and why			0
if we 're appalled by the dog trade in @entity7 , we should be similarly appalled by some of the conditions that exist in factory animal farms in the @entity22 -- including the use of " gestation crates " to confine mother pigs , a practice activist @entity242 has criticized , saying it 's like " asking a sow to live in an airline seat			1
" if we think dog should n't be eaten -- like , ever , regardless of how clean the trade is and how quick the kill -- then maybe we should think about the other animals we eat , and if and why we do n't feel the same way about them			1
is it because we spend so much time with dogs -- looking into their eyes , talking to them , walking them , picking up their crap -- that we understand that they are living , breathing , feeling beings ? would we feel that way about other animals if we could hang out more ? or would the beak - y , frowny face of the chicken still stop us short of empathy ? for his part , @entity41 , the photographer who shot the dog story , told me he was offered dog meat on the assignment but could n't eat it			1
" when i was photographing inside a dog meat restaurant -- claiming to be a chef studying @entity10 food -- i was offered to try it , " he said			2
" it probably looked very odd for a ' chef ' to say no but i turned it down			0
i just could n't bring myself to try it			0
" i likely would have done the same thing			0
exactly why ? that 's a harder question			0
and it 's the one all of us should further examine .			0

@entity0 's photo blog features an essay on the illegal dog - meat trade in @entity7
@entity292 : the graphic *details* of the photos , and the trade , are shocking and sad
but , he writes , the fact that people eat dog should not seem repugnant
he says it 's the equivalent of eating pig , which is another intelligent creature
