-- @entity1 believes his renowned ability as a frontrunner will land him the @entity5 title despite seeing his lead cut to a single stroke at the halfway stage friday			1
@entity1 was unable to reproduce his first round heroics when he shot a 63 , but followed it up with a two - under - par 70 for a two - round total of 11 - under 133			1
unheralded @entity14 @entity13 was his nearest challenger after a sparkling second round 65 while world number one @entity16 struggled to a one - over 73 to make the cut by one shot on three - under			1
@entity21 's @entity20 matched @entity13 's 65 to share third place on eight - under with @entity24 's @entity23 and @entity26 @entity25			1
defending champion @entity27 , who played in the same group as @entity1 and @entity16 , was among seven players a shot further back , which included last year 's @entity33 number one @entity34 of @entity35			1
@entity1 struggled from the outset with a bogey on his opening hole but recovered to card three birdies to the turn			1
on the easier back nine he would have expected to pull further clear but instead made two bogeys , canceled out by birdies at the 10th and 18th			2
the 24 - year - old remained optimistic he could build on his slender lead at the weekend and land his sixth @entity46 title			0
" i will just go back tonight and regroup and realize that i am still leading the tournament , " he told the official @entity46 website			0
" i hit a couple of loose drives which i have n't done the last couple of weeks but i still feel like i 'm playing well enough to go and win the tournament			0
" @entity1 has won a number of events , including the 2009 @entity5 after leading for much of the way and believes it will hold him in good stead			1
" i have led from the front quite well in tournaments that i have won			0
i feel like i am still playing well , i know the course as well as anyone else and i expect to go out there and shoot two good scores over the weekend and hopefully lift the trophy			0
" @entity13 , who won three events on the secondary @entity67 last season , carded seven birdies to earn his chance of pairing with @entity1 saturday			1
" i 've never played with @entity1 , so it 's going to be fun			2
i know him a little bit from seeing him around , so hopefully i 'll be able to play as well as i did today , " he said			0
@entity34 , who topped the money lists in both the @entity78 and @entity79 last season , looks to pose the biggest threat to @entity1			2
" i think there is still a little way to go but today was the best i have putted for a long , long time , " said the @entity35			0
woods , who missed the cut in his opening event of 2014 , was wayward off the tee and found the fairway just twice from 10 attempts when using his driver			0
the result was a three - bogey round that left him tied for for 44th , but still not out of the running if he could produce an inspired round at the weekend .			2

cards a two - under 70 for a two - round total of 11 - under 133
