at the outset of his term , the new president of @entity1 , @entity0 , will confront a thicket of national and international challenges			2
@entity0 's presidential term starts at a particularly challenging time ; the @entity8 of @entity1 is facing an unprecedented level of regional and international isolation			2
one of the most crucial foreign policy objectives which will take precedence in @entity0 's agenda is the @entity15 conflict , which has now entered its third year			1
the election result raises vital questions regarding whether @entity1 's foreign policy towards @entity23 's sect - based and police regime will be altered or whether @entity1 - @entity15 alliance will evolve into a new phase			1
will the presidency of the centrist @entity0 influence @entity1 's diplomatic ties with @entity28 and its unconditional support for @entity23 ? will @entity30 change its political , military , intelligence and advisory assistance to @entity15 's state apparatuses , army , security forces , and @entity36 ? while there is a significant amount of high expectations and enthusiasm among some @entity43 political leaders and scholars that the election of the centrist @entity0 might influence @entity1 's support of @entity23 , it is crucial to be realistic about @entity1 's centrist and moderate camp 's ideology , the power of the presidential office , @entity1 's political structure , and @entity30 's foreign policy objectives			1
first of all , it is necessary to note that the @entity1 centrists and moderates ' political spectrum analyze @entity15 from the realms of balance of power as well as from a religious and geopolitical paradigm rather than from a human rights one			0
although @entity0 argues for constructive interactions with other countries and although he supports applying a softer political tone -- as opposed to the combative , controversial and provocative language that @entity66 or other hardliners utilize -- when dealing with the international community and regional state actors in regards to @entity15 , @entity0 has not called for an overall sweeping shift in @entity1 's foreign policy			1
for instance , @entity0 has neither asked @entity23 to step down from power nor pressed to halt the @entity8 of @entity1 's military , intelligence , financial , and advisory support to @entity28			2
from the perspective of the centrists , including @entity0 , withdrawing support to @entity28 equates to undermining @entity30 's geopolitical leverage and balance of power in the region , which ultimately endangers their own power			0
this becomes particularly more significant to the @entity1 leaders who argue that they are surrounded by what they perceive as existential and strategic enemies ; the @entity89 ' military bases , for instance , are located throughout @entity1 's borders and in the @entity91 ( @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , etc )			0
more fundamentally , because of the role the @entity97 plays in @entity1 's foreign policy objectives , it would be unrealistic to argue that @entity0 would alter @entity1 's current political status quo towards @entity23 's regime			1
@entity0 does not completely control the country 's foreign relations with @entity15 ; @entity1 's policy towards @entity28 is closely guided by @entity97 ayatollah @entity104 , the high generals of @entity1 's @entity106 , and @entity107 -- @entity1 's intelligence			1
however , @entity0 does have the ability to set the tone in regional and international circles for the @entity97			0
in addition , the @entity97 has been very clear about his political stance on @entity15 , stating that @entity23 's regime is targeted by @entity115 and @entity89 - backed groups , foreign conspirators and terrorists			2
lastly , religiously and ideologically speaking , one of the major pillars of @entity1 's foreign policy has been that it has proclaimed itself as the safe - guarder of @entity123 -- particularly @entity124 -- values			2
the @entity128 sect - based state of @entity15 serves as a crucial instrument for advancing , empowering , and achieving this ideological foreign policy objective			0
@entity1 under @entity0 's presidency is unlikely to change the current status quo , push for regime change in @entity15 , ask @entity23 to step aside as many @entity43 and @entity91 did , or halt any political , military , intelligence and advisory assistance to @entity23 's ruling @entity128 and socialist @entity138 party , due to the belief that they will be ideologically and religiously weakening their own regional influence and foreign policy leverage			1
if the @entity128 lose power , the next government would likely be constituted from the current oppositional groups and the @entity147 majority in @entity15 , who comprise roughly 74 % of the population			0
as in @entity151 and @entity152 , where the @entity147 parties were the ones who won the elections , in @entity28 , the @entity147 oppositional groups are more likely to win most of the parliamentary seats in the situation of a new government forming after @entity23			0
this will be regarded as a considerable shift in regional and international balance of power against @entity1 and in favor of the @entity91 , particularly @entity93			0
considering the aforementioned factors : the president 's limited control over directing foreign policy compared to the @entity97 's more powerful role , the centrist and moderate ideologies , as well as the geopolitical , and ideological elements surrounding the issue , it is more likely that @entity1 will continue implementing its current strategies towards @entity15 to preserve @entity1 's regional and international balance of power , its political and economic national interests , and the survival of the ruling clerics			1
