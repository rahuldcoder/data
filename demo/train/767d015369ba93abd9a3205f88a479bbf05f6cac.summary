@entity0 -- the @entity3 administration is preparing to announce new rules allowing some travel to @entity6 , along with an expanded ability for @entity8 to send economic assistance , a senior @entity8 official and congressional sources said wednesday			1
according to two congressional aides briefed informally on the plans , the administration is expected to announce " soon " that it will essentially reinstate measures that were in place under the @entity18 administration			2
both aides stressed that the administration is still working through the details and legal language			0
" it 's a return to @entity18 , plus some , " one aide said , noting that president @entity24 tightened restrictions on travel and cultural exchanges			1
the central component of the policy involves " people to people " exchanges that would allow academics , corporations , humanitarian groups and athletic teams to travel to @entity6			2
the administration is not lifting tourist travel limits or the strict trade restrictions currently in place but would promote cultural exchanges and programs with universities or allow @entity8 farms to send assistance to @entity6 farmers as part of the new rules			1
one of the aides who supports the changes stressed that the goal is to allow travel for people to help @entity6 build their own economy and culture			0
the policy is " to go down there , give a message of hope , to help the @entity6 people forge their own future as they want , not necessarily as the way another government wants			0
" in addition , the administration is planning to expand the policy it announced last year that allowed @entity6 - @entity8 to send " remittances " or economic support to family members in @entity6			1
the new regulations would allow any @entity8 citizen , as well as universities , churches and businesses , to send money or sponsor a partner in @entity6			1
there would be a cap on the amount of money that could be sent			0
the new policy would make it easier for universities , sports teams and businesses to set up exchanges			0
the @entity87 would shift its current policy , which now denies visas for @entity6 to travel to the @entity8 , to one that gives a " presumption of approval " unless a review discovers a problem with the request			1
although the administration can not change current travel restrictions without congressional approval , it does have the authority to loosen visa rules the congressional aides expected the administration to unveil the changes through a statement by the president or the secretary of state , along with text of the new regulations			1
@entity87 spokesman @entity107 said tuesday that although he had nothing to announce , " our overarching goal here is to encourage a more open environment in @entity6 and increased respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms			0
and , consistent with that objective , we 've promoted measures to encourage the free flow of information and humanitarian items to the @entity6 people			0
" likewise , @entity122 deputy press secretary @entity121 gave no details in response to reporters ' questions tuesday but added , " the president is going to continue to do things that are in the best interest of the @entity8 and that help to create a more democratic environment and expand freedoms for the @entity6 people			2
