-- it 's taken less than a year for @entity2 to go from being the " @entity3 " to the " @entity4 " --- and the @entity6 manager has pinned the blame squarely on the shoulders of the media for his mood swing			1
a favorite with @entity13 journalists due to his pithy comments , @entity2 is less pleased with @entity15 after the @entity17 football show broadcast an interview in which he appeared to criticize his club 's strikers			1
former @entity22 star @entity21 , $ 80 million signing @entity23 and @entity26 international @entity25 have struggled for goals in the @entity28 this season , netting just 11 times between them			1
@entity2 is unhappy because he did n't know he was being filmed at the time he made the comments			1
" i really think it was a disgrace that somebody is recording a private conversation when obviously we do n't know , " a scowling @entity2 said ahead of wednesday 's @entity38 tie against @entity39			1
however @entity15 's chief editor and anchor @entity40 was unrepentant			0
" we are fully comfortable with this interview , " @entity40 told @entity0			1
" we are very surprised by @entity2 's comments , claiming it was off the record			1
the camera was located 50 centimeters , maybe one meter away from him			0
it was a tight close up			0
" the discussion was informal , but it was held in the middle of a large group of people , including our cameraman			2
so there is no way @entity2 could ignore he was filmed			1
" on monday , @entity57 published a video on its website , in which @entity2 commented : " the problem with @entity6 is we lack a scorer			1
i have one ( @entity21 ) but he 's 32			2
maybe 35 , who knows ? " the video has since reportedly been deleted by the @entity17 television channel , though @entity40 told @entity0 he was n't aware of its removal			2
" these videos come and go all the time			0
by definition they have quite a short lifespan , " he said			0
however , @entity13 media analyst , journalist and broadcaster @entity73 said he had sympathy for the @entity78 coach over the way he had been treated			2
" generally speaking you should n't record a private conversation unless there is a significant public interest anyway , " @entity80 told @entity0			1
" in this case it 's hard to see any public interest at all			0
" a few comments he makes about a particular player would n't seem to me to pass any public interest test			0
i 'm not saying it 's not interesting , especially to a @entity6 fan			2
" he 's not what you 'd call a media ingÃ © nue			2
he knows what he 's doing			0
i 'm sure he 'll play this for all it 's worth but on the face of it he would appear to have a case			0
" @entity2 spoke on tuesday to both defend @entity21 and attack the media , with whom he has had a love - hate relationship throughout his career			1
" i think you should be a bit embarrassed as it is against the ethics that you have in your work , " said @entity2 , who returned as @entity6 manager last june after spells with @entity112 and @entity113			1
@entity2 signed @entity21 at @entity112 and brought the four - time @entity120 player of the year to @entity121 from @entity123 club @entity122 on a one - year deal to bolster @entity6 's strike force this season			1
while @entity21 may no longer be the potent poacher he was for @entity22 in front of goal , @entity2 underlined his respect for the @entity132 international , who has scored eight goals this season for the @entity28 leaders			1
" from my perspective the comment is not a good one , it 's not something i would do in an official interview , " the 51 - year - old said			0
" firstly because i do n't make fun and there are managers who really defend their players and i am obviously one of them			0
" thirdly @entity21 is @entity21			2
he 's four times a @entity38 winner			0
it was with him that i had the best ever season of my career			0
" there is no story , i repeat , it was a funny conversation between me and somebody that does not belong to the football world			0
" from my own point of view , is it an unhappy comment ? absolutely , but i think by the ethical point of view , it ( the situation ) is a real disgrace			0
