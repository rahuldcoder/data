before we jump into a debate about the environmental costs of eating meat , here are three things you should know : 1			1
i 've experimented with vegetarianism twice , but it 's never really stuck			2
round one ended when i had a dream about a spicy chicken sandwich from @entity13 , and then woke up to march zombie - style to that fast - food restaurant to order it			2
round two may or may not have ended with the brunch i had sunday , i 'm still not sure			2
i ate chicken chilaquiles for brunch on sunday			2
this is not an anti-meat polemic			2
but i have been thinking in recent weeks about our relationships with animals and what our diets mean for the health of the environment			2
it started while i was doing research for a story on illegal animal trafficking , and i was reading books , including @entity36 's " @entity35 " -- about how the @entity38 foodie scene is trending toward the bizarre and endangered ( witness the 2010 bust of a @entity41 restaurant serving whale ) -- and @entity44 's " @entity43 , " which argues , in part , that one can not eat meat and also earnestly claim to be an environmentalist			1
" ( @entity50 ) omeone who regularly eats factory - farmed animal products can not call himself an environmentalist without divorcing that word from its meaning , " he wrote in that book			2
since it 's @entity58 , i thought that last point might merit some dissection			1
is it possible to eat meat in modern - day @entity38 , consider yourself an environmentalist and sleep soundly without being a hypocrite ? or , as @entity67 argues , are those terms increasingly incongruous ? @entity69 : tips for eating green on @entity58 i called up a few experts and asked your advice on this topic			1
as one of my @entity79 friends was smart to point out , it 's probably not a good idea to be in the business of telling people " what they are or are not			0
" environmentalism takes many forms and encompasses a range of issues			0
i 'm not willing to say a person can not be an environmentalist and also an omnivore			0
( if you ride a bike and eat steak , is that better or worse than being a vegetarian who drives a @entity96 ? ) but i would hope that person has thought through the very real environmental consequences of meat consumption			1
animal rights aside , there are plenty to consider			0
here are a few : 1			0
raising animals for meat is much less efficient than growing vegetables : think back to those food chain diagrams from elementary school			1
animals are higher on the food chain than plants , and therefore they take more land , food and water to grow for our consumption			1
the difference in efficiency is n't negligible : raising a kilogram of beef requires 15,500 liters of water , according to @entity120			1
an equivalent amount of bread requires only 1,300 liters of water ; bananas use 860 ; and tomatoes consume just 180 liters , or about 1 % of the water required for beef			1
( chocolate , by the way , is actually worse than all of these , requiring 24,000 liters ; but it 's clear that a vegetarian diet is far more water - and energy - efficient than one that includes meat			1
) at a time when rivers in the @entity139 are running dry because of drought and climate change , it 's worth considering the impact our eating habits have on water use			1
the same is true for land			0
because growing vegetables is more land - efficient than growing meat , we would need to eat far less meat in order to avoid taking over more forests for farms , said @entity154 , a professor of ecology and environmental biology at @entity157			1
to be sustainable , @entity38 needs to eat about half the meat it does today , he said			1
that would return us to about 1940s consumption levels			0
per capita meat consumption in the @entity38 appears to have peaked around the year 2000 at more than 180 pounds of meat per person per year , or about half a pound each day , according to the @entity166			1
it 's fallen slightly since then , which is good news			0
animal agriculture pollutes the water : last summer , like pretty much every summer , there was a " dead zone " in the @entity173 the size of @entity175			1
blame agriculture , including animal agriculture , for that disturbing phenomenon , which is caused when phosphorus and nitrogen from chemical fertilizer and manure run down the @entity182 and into the gulf			0
much of the fertilizer that ends up in that watershed is used to grow corn , 80 % of which is being produced to feed livestock and fish , according to @entity191 figures cited by @entity192			0
the amount of manure that animal farms create is also staggering -- @entity38 federal agencies estimate livestock and poultry " generate " about 500 million tons of manure per year -- and has serious consequences for the health of rivers and groundwater			1
eating meat adds to your greenhouse gas footprint : finally , eating animals , like doing almost anything , contributes to a person 's greenhouse gas footprint			1
the @entity211 estimates animal agriculture accounts for 14.5 % of human greenhouse gas emissions , with the main source of those emissions -- 45 % of the total -- being the fossil fuels used while growing and fertilizing crops to feed the animals			2
there 's some debate about how much animal agriculture contributes to climate change overall			1
but there 's no doubt it has a sizable impact , and more so than plant agriculture			0
according to the @entity230 , eating a half - pound of beef creates more than 7 pounds of carbon - dioxide - equivalent gases			2
pork and chicken are better , creating about 2 pounds and half a pound , respectively			0
potatoes , apples and asparagus are better still , creating a tiny fraction of a pound of greenhouse gases			0
so : knowing all that , i would encourage you to consider giving up meat -- or even just one of the most resource - intensive meats , like beef -- for @entity58			1
see how it goes , and maybe you can make it a habit			0
there are many other worthy efforts you could make to protect the environment , of course			0
you could ride a bike , take a train , turn off the heat or @entity259 but giving up meat for a day is an easy and meaningful one			1
" if all @entity38 eliminated just one quarter - pound serving of beef per week , the reduction in global warming pollution would be equal to taking 4 to 6 million cars off the road , " according to the @entity230			0
you might find it 's awful and decide to focus your future efforts elsewhere			0
or , like me , you might find it 's not so bad			0
i 'm not going to make any bold pronouncements about my eating habits besides the fact that i 'm going to try to eat less meat			1
( i like @entity277 founder @entity276 's idea of eating meat only on the weekends ; and singer @entity281 's idea of @entity282			1
) i travel frequently , and value flexibility , so i 've never really wanted to be too strict about my diet in the long term			0
but one day ? one week ? one month ? it 's not that hard			0
to the minority of vegans and vegetarians who like to proselytize about their eating habits , i 'm sure that seems like an annoying cop - out			2
but there are plenty of environmentalists who advocate a middle - road approach to meat consumption			2
" certainly there are modest steps we can all take that can really have a significant benefit if a lot of people did them , " said @entity297 , a health and food expert at @entity230 , the environmental group			1
" we often fall into this mistaken all - or - nothing mentality			0
" i like that approach			0
it 's one more people are likely to stomach			0
and it 's one that -- even for a day -- can have real impact .			0

a growing body of evidence shows eating meat has environmental consequences
@entity320 says readers should consider giving up meat on @entity58
he *writes* that meat production pollutes water and contributes to climate change
expert : eating less meat helps ; it does n't have to be ' all or nothing '
