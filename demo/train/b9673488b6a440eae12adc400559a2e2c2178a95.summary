@entity0 , @entity1 -- in 2001 , i came to @entity0 , the poorest town in @entity1 , to serve the community 's severely disenfranchised young people by starting an employment and ged program			1
their lives were the embodiment of what happened to @entity0 and this region : chaos through abandonment			1
however , tough times and severe hardship are nothing new			0
it 's been this way for decades			2
once one of the most important steel manufacturing centers in the world , @entity0 -- what 's left of it -- solemnly affirms one of the great economic maxims of our society : socialism for the rich , and capitalism for the poor			1
since the massive banking bailout of 2008 , i have often wondered what @entity0 would be today , if 35 years ago , the @entity36 government also channeled hundreds of billions of dollars ( and trillions in guarantees ) to save the steel industry , the hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs it produced and the families it sustained			1
instead , places like @entity0 were allowed to descend into decades of disorder , poverty and desertion			1
@entity0 went from a prosperous community of 20,000 residents , to a shattered town of fewer than 3,000 today			1
@entity0 looks every bit the deserted battlefield it truly is : 90 percent of our town 's people , buildings , businesses , and homes are gone and what remains , bears witness to the torment			1
in 2005 , those same young people i was privileged to work for helped elect me mayor			1
senseless homicides long lost their ability to shock , so i began to tattoo the dates of the killings on my arm as a living document of our collective loss			0
upon taking office , we set out to help reinvent @entity0 through diverse solutions ranging from effective policing and the arts , to urban agriculture and youth employment			1
today , buildings have been saved and repurposed			0
we farm for organic produce from formerly overgrown land , and can offer full summer employment for our youth			0
perhaps most importantly , no dates have been added to my forearm in over 20 months			0
however , at the start of my second term as mayor , we have decades of work ahead and we 'll never come close to replacing what 's been taken			2
as the saying goes , we 're not looking for a handout , but a hand up and the chance to ameliorate three decades of socioeconomic unraveling			0
towards those ends , the stimulus , known as @entity94 , has been a true fiscal balm , especially since our community 's hospital , and largest employer , @entity99 announced it would be shutting @entity101 later this month , taking jobs along with our residents ' access to health care			2
@entity106 : share your thoughts on the @entity109 @entity0 received $ 250,000 in stimulus funding for the @entity112 compliance upgrade of our sewer system and $ 30,000 that enabled us to hire an additional 30 young people this past summer who would have otherwise been unemployed			1
without question , these stimulus funds were a needed infusion of resources			0
however , i believe the greatest promise of the @entity94 remains untapped and now represents an unprecedented opportunity for growth and renewal			0
in @entity0 and in the surrounding areas , we have an abundance of quality , shovel - ready projects that range in complexity and scope from small - scale urban farming , and retrofitting a now - vacant 300,000 square foot hospital , to a $ 300 million - dollar repurposing of a former steel mill site into a green enterprise zone of economic redevelopment			1
investments like these will not only help reinvent communities like @entity0 , but will also foster a boom in job creation and long - term growth			2
these and similar projects across the country represent but a tiny fraction of the resources spent to save feckless bankers and @entity152 from their own unchecked greed and hubris			2
perhaps equally important , i believe this kind of investment will help restore a sense of social justice that is completely absent in today 's public debates			0
consider the absurd juxtaposition of rescued banking executives defending multi-million - dollar bonuses , to our community at over 30 percent unemployment , widespread abandonment , and pervasive poverty while losing the area 's only hospital and access to medical care			0
the explanation of this circumstance is as simple as the contrast is stark : one got capitalism and the other , socialism			0
basic fairness and equity demand that the color of your collar should not dictate if you receive a bail - out or get bailed on			0
for @entity36 living in places like @entity0 , i believe the @entity94 is perhaps the last , best chance to help overcome the injustice and harm that the decades steeped in a laissez - faire orthodoxy have wrought			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			2

for decades , @entity0 , @entity1 , has been in *decline* as it lost jobs and people
mayor @entity189 says the *population* *shrank* from 20,000 to fewer than 3,000
he says stimulus plan has helped *reverse* the tide in the old steel town
@entity189 : government bails out @entity152 while allowing @entity202 to suffer
