@entity0 -- for the second time this summer , a @entity0 police officer has been stripped of his badge and gun after video surfaced showing what community leaders call a heavy - handed police response			1
the latest incident to highlight lingering tension with the nation 's largest police force occurred sunday when a handful of officers attempted to disperse a group of vendors in order to reopen traffic after the conclusion of a @entity22 street fair			1
in a video taken by an onlooker and posted to @entity26 , words are exchanged and officers attempt to arrest a man			1
a woman intervenes and pushing and shoving ensues			0
later , once officers have the young man on the ground , one officer punches him while another kicks him in the back			1
the scene grows tense , with witnesses taking video of the pushing and shoving and civilians tussling with officers			2
five people were arrested on charges ranging from second - degree assault to resisting arrest to obstruction of government administration , police said			1
" what we see here is people get assaulted , get hurt and the same thing goes without any sort of accountability , " @entity22 resident @entity49 told @entity1 affiliate @entity50			2
" it keeps repeating itself			0
" on wednesday , police commissioner @entity60 said the unidentified officer seen in the video kicking the man has been relieved of his badge and gun pending an internal affairs investigation			1
" i was very concerned with a video that was taken and the actions of one of our officers who was scene kicking an individual , " @entity60 told reporters			1
" as best ( as ) i can tell -- looking at that video -- ( it ) seemed unprovoked			0
that officer has been suspended ... we will treat those types of actions very seriously			1
" the tactics of the @entity82 came under fire after the july 17 death of @entity85 , 43			0
he died after being placed in a chokehold by an officer during an arrest for selling loose cigarettes on @entity91			0
the incident , which was captured on video , led to anti-police demonstrations			1
the @entity0 medical examiner 's officer last month ruled his death a homicide			1
during the encounter , @entity85 raised both hands in the air and told the officers not to touch him			0
seconds later , a video shows an officer behind him grab the 350 - pound man in a choke hold and pull him to the sidewalk , rolling him onto his stomach			1
" i ca n't breathe ! i ca n't breathe ! " @entity85 said repeatedly , his cries muffled into the pavement			0
the cause of @entity85 's death was " compression of neck ( chokehold ) , compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police , " said @entity122 , a spokeswoman for the medical examiner 's office			2
acute and chronic bronchial asthma , obesity and hypertensive cardiovascular disease were listed as contributing factors in a controversial death that sparked calls for a federal investigation			0

after sunday 's confrontation between police and street vendors in @entity22 's @entity153 section , officials wrote @entity60 to demand a " broader conversation " about relations with the community			1
" we find the physical aggression that is depicted in witness videos disturbing , " city council member @entity157 wrote in a letter with rep. @entity160 of @entity0			2
" in the last few months , we have seen far too many signs of a deeply strained relationship between the police and our @entity153 neighborhood ... we are community of immigrants that has historically felt isolated from the police			2
we are a community that has feared the use of excessive force by the @entity82			2
" earlier this month , @entity60 announced that all @entity82 officers will undergo a three - day retraining period on the proper use of force when engaging a suspect			0
the training will focus on how officers can avoid physical confrontations when talking to and restraining suspects , as well as how to safely take them into custody without bringing harm to either the individual or the officer			0
officers will also undergo a leadership and cultural sensitivity workshop			0
