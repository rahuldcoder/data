@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has n't lived here in over 50 years but @entity5 is still his home			1
in the garden there 's his boat " the @entity9 " used to hunt marlin and then @entity12 subs off @entity1 during @entity13 on a bathroom wall next to a scale are the daily records of what the writer weighed			1
lizards and frogs he caught rest in jars filled with formaldehyde			0
antelopes and buffalo heads taken as trophies from @entity28 safaris decorate the walls			0
yellowing @entity30 and @entity32 magazines are still on the shelves			0
now a museum , a visitor to @entity5 or " lookout farm , " could be mistaken for thinking @entity3 might walk in the door at any second			1
" our philosophy was to recover the environment and surroundings , " said @entity39 , the museum 's curator			2
" this was not just a mere house , this was his home			0
" @entity3 lived in the home on a hilltop on the outskirts of @entity0 from 1939 to 1960			1
the years were pivotal ones for the famed @entity53 writer and for his adopted home of @entity1			1
@entity55 : @entity3 's life in photos in 1953 , @entity3 won the @entity58 for his book the " @entity59 " about an aging @entity1 fisherman 's epic duel with a marlin			1
six years later revolutionaries led by @entity64 took control of the island , leading to the eventual breakdown in relations with the @entity53			2
battling depression , @entity3 killed himself in @entity70 , @entity71 in 1961			2
even though the @entity5 receives over 40,000 visitors a year , the house nearly fell victim to @entity1 's unforgiving environment			1
" this is a very humid climate , " @entity76 said			0
" we 're on top of a hill where winds and even hurricanes batter the house			0
" in 2005 , the @entity84 called the house " a preservation emergency , " citing roof leaks and shifting foundations that endangered the house			0
one of the people who came to the house 's rescue was @entity93 , the granddaughter of @entity94 , the editor who first pushed for @entity3 's work to be published and worked with the writer for the rest of his life			1
" i realized we could help because of my connection to @entity3 through my grandfather , " @entity99 said			2
" that we could bring about a collaboration between the @entity53 and @entity1 which after 50 years of embargo little collaboration has happened between the two countries and yet here was this shared cultural legacy , deeply appreciated by the @entity1 people and the @entity53 people			1
" @entity99 started the @entity110 , navigating the bureaucracies of two countries and restrictions of the @entity53 embargo to bring restoration experts to the project			1
one of those experts was home improvement icon @entity118 , who is also @entity120			0
@entity118 said helping to save @entity3 's house transcends politics			1
" it 's the best cultural bridge we could have hoped for between the @entity53 people and the @entity1 people			1
and i emphasize people , i am not talking governments , " @entity118 told @entity2			0
" the @entity1 people and the @entity53 people have a warm relationship that goes back many decades			1
it 's a very important project			2
" @entity55 : @entity64 mingles with celebrities in $ 1 million renovation , the @entity1 government restored the main house on the property			2
curators estimate another $ 1 million is needed to save a collapsing guest house on the property , repair @entity3 's cracked swimming pool and build a workshop to restore thousands of original documents			1
until then , restorers are carefully packing up @entity3 's letters and writings to protect them from further decay			2
" he gathered ideas and wrote about them in the margins in the books , " @entity99 said			0
" and that ' marginalia ' has never been seen before by scholars outside of @entity1			2
" eventually those writings will be digitized and exhibited at the @entity153 in @entity154 , @entity155			0
already , @entity3 's @entity1 writings have solved one mystery for @entity93			1
" what i always noticed was that they called each other ' dear mr. @entity94 , dear mr. @entity3 , ' she said			0
" then one day they started saying ' @entity162 , @entity163			0
" how did that happen ? " a letter from @entity1 following @entity3 's father 's suicide in 1928 provided the answer			1
" @entity3 was extremely distraught , " @entity99 said			0
" there 's a post-script in that letter , ' for @entity171 's sake will you unmister me anyway			0
' " " @entity94 was quite a bit older than @entity3 , " his granddaughter @entity99 said , " and who @entity3 felt safe with and nurtured by , so this was a deepening in their relationship			0
