but , @entity7 told @entity13 , archaeologists at the time " misdiagnosed " the cannon			1

he realized the 2003 find might have been the one			0

the team measured and photographed the ship			0
but some items , including the cannon , had been looted from the ship in the intervening years , @entity7 said			1
the ship " still has attributes that warrant an excavation to determine the site 's identity , " archaeologist @entity55 of @entity56 said tuesday			2
" @entity7 may have finally discovered the 1492 @entity2			2
" the evidence , @entity55 said , is " very compelling			2

@entity4 set off back to @entity75 with the two remaining ships , the @entity106 and the @entity107 , in january 1493			0
archaeological study needed archaeologists will have to excavate and examine the ship found off @entity1 in order to determine whether it is , in fact , the @entity2			1
