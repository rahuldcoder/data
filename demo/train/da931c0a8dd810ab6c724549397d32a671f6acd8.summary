-- @entity1 , home to 20 million people , represents the paradox of the modern @entity1 , the side - by - side juxtaposition -- in everything from politics to architecture -- of old and new			1
turn a corner , and you 'll see a church that is 300 years old			0
turn another , and you can get @entity13 in a @entity14			0
the @entity1 , also known as @entity1 , serves as a constant reminder that @entity16 are about maintaining tradition , except when they 're sidestepping it			1
they 're about moving forward , except when they are unable to let go of the past			0
they 're about preserving memory , except when they have amnesia			0
for example , when it comes to forgiving the corrupt @entity29 ( also known by its initials , @entity29 ) , whose leaders brutalized the @entity16 people and plundered the country for much of the 20th century , they have short memories ; they recently returned the @entity29 to power by electing @entity38 to the presidency			1
he takes office december 1			0
but when it comes to the aftermath of the @entity45 - @entity16 war , which lasted from 1846 to 1848 and resulted in the @entity45 seizing half of @entity1 's territory -- the modern - day @entity47 -- @entity16 ' memories are long , and forgiveness is n't easy to find			1
even after all these years , in diplomatic circles , you still hear talk of the " sovereignty " issue -- which , loosely defined , means the constant effort by @entity1 to keep the @entity45 from meddling in its domestic affairs and the need for the @entity45 to tread lightly			2
news : in @entity1 , @entity62 immigrants under fire i went to @entity1 recently as part of a delegation of @entity16 - @entity45 and @entity45 @entity68 leaders organized by the @entity69 and @entity70 of the @entity71			1
for the global @entity68 advocacy organization , the goal of the trip was to strengthen relations between @entity16 - @entity45 and @entity68 in the @entity45			1
although my grandfather was born in @entity77 and came to the @entity45 with his family as a boy during the @entity80 , i 'm hopelessly @entity45			0
this is my fourth trip to @entity1 in the past 15 years , and i still feel like a foreigner			2
with each visit , the place reinvents itself			0
as becomes clear when one spends any length of time here , this beautiful city is also the place where taboos disappear -- except when they do n't			0
a liberal island in this overwhelming @entity93 country , the city legalized early - term abortion in 2007 and gay marriage and single - sex adoption in 2010			0
@entity38 has even broached a topic that would have been heresy just to mention 20 years ago : amending the @entity98 to allow foreign companies to enter into contracts with the @entity16 government and drill for oil on land and in the @entity104			2
and yet , even with all the progress and openness in @entity1 over the past few years , there is still one subject that no one talks about , one that is still off - limits : race			1
the enduring taboo subject is skin color , whether an individual 's complexion betrays an allegiance to the @entity118 who conquered the @entity121 empire in 1521 or the @entity121 who were conquered			0
it 's no exaggeration to say that , in this country and especially in this city , the best , highest - paying , most important jobs often seem to go to those who , in addition to having the best education and the strongest connections , have the lightest skin			2
on television , in politics and in academia , you see light - skinned people			1
on construction sites , in police forces and in restaurant kitchens , you 're more likely to find those who are dark - skinned			1
in the priciest neighborhoods , the homeowners have light skin , and the housekeepers are dark			2
everyone knows this , and yet no one talks about it , at least not in elite circles			0
nor do @entity16 seem all that eager to discuss the larger dynamic that race feeds into : the fact that this is , and has always been , a country of deep divisions			2
in the 100 years since the @entity80 , one part of @entity1 has often been at war with another : urban vs. rural , rich vs. poor and , yes , dark - skinned vs. light - skinned			1
it 's one reason that institutions such as the economy , the political system and the social structure have n't matured as quickly as they should have , given @entity1 's advantages			1
this country of 120 million people has ports , highways , airports and skyscrapers			0
it takes in billions of dollars every year in revenues from oil and natural gas , and billions more from tourism and remittances from @entity16 migrants living abroad			2
@entity1 's economy is growing faster than the @entity45 economy , and investments are flowing in from @entity183 and @entity184			1
it 's consistently within the top three of trading partners for the @entity45			0
but what good is all that when only a small number of the population can live up to their full potential ? prejudice kills progress			1
it 's time for @entity1 to confront the color line and free itself of its past			1
or it wo n't have much of a future			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201			0

@entity201 : in @entity1 , the old and new are juxtaposed in everything
@entity201 : issues break down into urban vs. rural , dark - skinned vs. light - skinned
light - skinned @entity16 have the advantages , he says , but nobody talks about this bias
many @entity16 ca n't *achieve* their potential , he says , and prejudice kills @entity1 's progress
