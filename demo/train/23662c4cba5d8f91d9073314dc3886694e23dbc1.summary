do you crave the seclusion of your own private island , but hate being tied down in one place ? if so , an @entity5 firm has developed the solution to your troubles -- a man - made floating " island " , complete with two small diesel engines for whenever you fancy a change of scenery			1
the oval - shaped " @entity18 " has been designed to combine the mobility of a yacht with the comfort of a house			1
it offers six bedrooms spread over three floors and 1,000 square meters -- nearly four tennis courts -- worth of luxury living space			1
although it does n't come with an actual tennis court , those longing for some sub-aquatic snooker will be relieved to learn that there is a large games room in the island 's " hull			2
" the underwater karaoke suite , meanwhile , is ideal for those whose singing voice is best kept a safe distance from civilization			0
the island also comes complete with all the usual ocean - bound comforts of the mega-rich : @entity40 , barbeque , sun loungers , minibar , stately dining room and , of course , aquarium			1
the price tag for all of this is certainly more than you 'd expect to pay for a mainland mansion but , at $ 6.5 million , it falls well below the average cost of the gigayachts and @entity55 islands currently favored by the fabulously wealthy			1
" since we launched there has been an unbelievable amount of interest in the island			2
everyday i get inquiries from people all over the world including the @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 , " said @entity61 , @entity18 's head of communications			1
" so far there does n't seem to be a typical customer			0
i have spoken to private people looking for a luxury retreat , investors looking for a good deal and hotel chains who want to branch out and try something different , " she added			0
the island is the passion project of @entity82 - born entrepreneur @entity81 , a former hotelier who wanted to combine the best features of luxury hotels with the flexibility that a superyacht provides			2
measuring 37 meters long , the island can be anchored anywhere in the world its owner fancies			1
but , although it resembles the " @entity92 " from " @entity91 " , the " @entity18 " is unable to reach tropical destinations at lightening speed , as its diminutive diesel engines are equipped for short journeys only			2
instead , the company recommends that its owners use a towboat or cargo ship for long haul moves			0
to boost its green credentials , the designers have incorporated 160 square meters of solar panels on the roof , as well as wind generators that can produce 28 - 30 kilowatt hours of power ( kwh ) -- the average daily consumption of a family household			1
" the maximum power usage that can occur on the island when everything is used at the same time is calculated to be 45 kwh			0
in those cases the two diesel engines are used to cover the increased energy needs , " said @entity61			0
if the island 's owners inadvertently find themselves as island castaways , the vessel also has its own desalination system , capable of converting 12,000 liters seawater to drinking water , using the process of " reverse osmosis			0
" according to @entity130 , the design phase of the island was completed over a month ago and the company is currently in the production preparation phase : " we have several pre-orders and we are starting to build the islands early next year in our facilities in central @entity67			0
" with the production time set to drop from 24 months to under a year as the company expands , the floating " @entity140 " might very soon become a not - too - permanent fixture on the horizon .			0
