@entity0 of @entity1 is one of the world 's biggest , if not the biggest , stars right now			0
twelve months on from her marriage to prince @entity5 , she is credited with reinvigorating the @entity7 monarchy and arguably helping secure its future			2
it may look like @entity10 , or @entity11 as she is popularly known , has breezed through her first year of official engagements , but the apparent ease belies a great deal of hard work and careful planning			1
when a senior royal source earlier this month told @entity19 that @entity11 had " achieved her objectives , " it was no surprise that he used the language of boardrooms			1
@entity24 , which looks after after the duke , duchess and @entity27 , has deliberately taken a corporate approach to @entity11 's role			1
aides equate her to a chief executive and regard themselves as advisers -- she calls the shots but they are there to help			0
this has been the case since the outset			0
every element of @entity11 's wedding to prince @entity5 last year -- from the cake to the trees in the church -- were either dreamed up by the couple or approved by them			1
@entity11 did n't go into this naively			1
she had been @entity5 's girlfriend for several years before they wed and she had already experienced the dark side of royalty			0
at one point , she had been forced to move out of @entity52 because of paparazzi aggression			1
by the time @entity5 and @entity11 announced their engagement , they both felt she was ready for the spotlight			1
the prince made sure the palace gave @entity11 the support she needed and this year she got her own assistant private secretary , @entity61			1
the duchess has had the best available training , nearly all of it in - house			2
palace staff provide day - to - day support but @entity5 has taken the lead , with backup from his father , prince @entity70 , and grandmother , @entity72			0
the palace did n't know how easily the duchess would take to official duties , but when @entity5 said she was ready , they trusted his judgment			2
as soon as the couple arrived in @entity79 for their first overseas tour last year , it was clear she had already mastered the walkabout			0
she has since gone on to complete the full range of public duties expected of a working royal			1
@entity19 's royal source confirms @entity11 has completed her " induction " as a " fully fledged member of the royal family			1
" the palace is clearly thrilled			0
when the source talks about @entity11 's character , it reads like a wish list for a successful ceo : " she is strong - willed			1
she is confident enough to handle it			0
" @entity11 's composure is also down to the fact that she feels comfortable with her appearance			1
she buys most of her outfits herself in regular stores such as @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			0
she occasionally visits upscale stores like @entity108 and @entity109 but usually arrives unannounced			0
often , the first a designer hears that the duchess has bought an outfit is when she appears in public wearing it			1
surprisingly , her outfits are often from previous seasons and the duchess is n't averse to bringing out old favorites			2
@entity11 is n't a fashion icon , even if she does have a huge impact on sales , but she does have an uncanny ability to pick something that suits her and the occasion			1
she knows how to make herself feel comfortable			0
another element to the duchess 's apparent ease in front of huge crowds of press and public is down to coping mechanisms			1
gallery : photographer 's year with the duchess once she steps out of the car at a public engagement , @entity11 usually homes in on someone in the welcoming party or crowd			1
while that person is delighted by being center of her attention , they are also helping her block out the frenzy around her			2
it 's not just a superficial exercise			0
the duchess wants to make the most of her visits , learning what she can , and she can only do this by engaging directly with the people involved			2
royal photographers often complain that @entity11 shies away from their lenses hides or behind her hair			1
the royal source accepts " she does n't look at the cameras , but it 's not deliberate			2
she blocks out the media			2
she forgets they are there			0
she has commented several times after an event that she forgot the cameras were there			0
" this may have helped with her first speech last month in the @entity7 town of @entity169 , which was broadcast live globally via @entity19			1
she had a potential audience of billions , but was n't told until afterwards			0
@entity171 would have added to the pressure			0
although @entity5 had been coaching her via phone from the @entity175 , an example of his hands - on role , her inaugural address was delivered in her own style : slow , controlled and measured			0
on occasion @entity11 has taken matters into her own hands			2
when a media frenzy erupted around her new puppy , the palace was inundated with queries about its name , but the duchess refused to let her new pet become a public relations issue			1
instead she wanted the name -- @entity193 -- to come out naturally , which it eventually did during a conversation with students at a school in the city of @entity200			0
the @entity193 incident illustrates that the duchess clearly sees a line between her public and private lives			1
according to the palace source , @entity11 treasures the normality of her personal life			1
" she goes to @entity209 , goes shopping and spends time with her family , " he said			0
" the palace takes an incredibly hard line on privacy so she can have a private life and go to @entity216 [ a superstore ] and @entity209			1
the princes get their normality from the [ military ] service			0
" and her late mother - in - law , princess @entity222 , read what the papers said about her -- as does @entity5 -- @entity11 does not keep a close eye on how the media is covering her , but is mindful of their interest			1
the royal source says she is aware of her stardom and that it stems partly stems from @entity222 's legacy			2
she takes the comparison to @entity222 as " a compliment " but is clearly doing things her own way			0
so we 've had the wedding , the full range of public appearances ... what next ? the source tells @entity19 : " the palace would never discuss , confirm or deny rumors about pregnancy until she is ready to announce it			2
" the duchess has passed her first year of royalty with flying colors , at least in the palace 's view			0
@entity5 may not always feel comfortable in the limelight but , according to the source , his wife may have found her niche			0
" for her , the public engagements are a joy			0
