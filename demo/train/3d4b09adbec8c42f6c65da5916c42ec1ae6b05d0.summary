of course , if you 're a computer historian , you already know that @entity0 refers to the @entity2 from @entity3			1
if not , here 's the story : the 2.5 - ton machine , first constructed in the 1950s as part of an atomic research program , became the " world 's oldest original working digital computer " after a museum in the @entity13 restored and then rebooted it on tuesday			1
unlike today 's nearly mute devices , the massive computer clicks , clacks and flashes like something out of an old sci - fi movie			1
" in 1951 the @entity0 ( the other , less - amazing name for the @entity0 ) was one of perhaps a dozen computers in the world , and since then it has led a charmed life surviving intact while its contemporaries were recycled or destroyed , " @entity20 , a trustee at the @entity13 's @entity21 , said in a news release			1
the computer outlived its usefulness in atomic research by 1957 and was used as a teaching device until 1973			1
it went on display briefly before being dismantled , the museum says , and then was " rediscovered " by volunteers at the museum in 2008 or 2009			2
the computer 's " flashing lights and clattering printers and readers provides an awe - inspiring display for visiting school groups and the general public keen to learn about our rich computer heritage , " the museum says			1
it 's also a healthy reminder that not all gadgets have to die after a single product cycle			2
at a time when iphones are swapped out every 12 months , the @entity49 calculator and this computer are among the only pieces of technological machinery that have survived for decades			1
the @entity0 , however , does n't serve much of a practical purpose at this point			0
" all together , the machine can store 90 numbers			0
the closest analogy is a man with a pocket calculator , " @entity58 , who led the restoration effort , tells the @entity60 in a video about the restoration ( you should watch the video , by the way , if for no other reason that to see this thing in action ; it sounds like a broken typewriter as it works )			1
" however , unlike the man with a pocket calculator , this machine can carry on day and night , and it does n't make mistakes			1
" modern computers store information in binary code , or a system of 1s and 0s			0
the @entity0 , by contrast , features walls of dekatron valves , which are little light - bulb - looking things			0
it counts on a 10 - digit decimal system			0
" all told , the @entity0 had 40 banks of 8 dekatrons , meaning it could store up to 40 8 - digit numbers , " @entity87 writes for the website @entity88			0
" the computational processes themselves , carried out by relays , was very slow -- somewhere on the order of 5 or 10 seconds to multiply two numbers			0
" another drawback : the witch reads computer programs from paper tape with holes punched in it			1
the computer " does n't have a keyboard or a monitor like a modern machine , " @entity58 explains in an @entity103 video			2
perhaps the machine is so mesmerizing because , in a way , you can see how it works			0
modern computers -- much less the @entity112 or smartphones -- are largely silent , glowing devices			0
they seem powered by wizardry			0
the @entity0 , by contrast , is a clacking , blinking , ticking mess of mechanical parts			0
" to see it in action is to watch the inner workings of a computer -- something that is impossible on the machines of today , " @entity20 , from the museum , says in the news release			1
" the restoration has been in full public view and even before it was working again the interest from the public was enormous			2
" if you want to see the machine for yourself , it 's on display at the @entity21 in @entity137 , north of @entity138			2
it 's located on the @entity141 estate , which was home to @entity144 's codebreakers during @entity145			0

the " world 's oldest original working digital computer " gets a reboot
the witch is now *operational* at a museum in the @entity13
the computer , created for atomic research , was restored over three years
it has the computing power of " a man with a pocket calculator "
