-- newspaper photography and photojournalism make up a craft unlike any other in journalism			1
a frozen moment can convey human strength or weakness like few other story forms			2
an image created by a photojournalist carries the power to change societies			2
great images remain burned into our brains forever			2
journalists like to say that newspapers write the first draft of history , but that 's only partly true -- the best news photos are history			0
the @entity24 nurtured great photographers since the paper was founded			1
in fact , in an early @entity29 nameplate , the paper called itself " @entity33 " and carried the icon of a professional camera			2
but on thursday morning , may 30 , that illustrious era ended when the paper 's editor dismissed 28 photojournalists with just a few words			1
how did they respond ? they captured the grief and horror and emotion with their reporter 's notebooks -- their cameras			0
i was lucky enough to work with these pros during my four years as a visual editor at the paper and saw the extraordinary lengths they went to , and risks they took , to make powerful @entity29 photos or in - depth photo reportage for investigative projects , such as the legendary " @entity58 " series			1
my fellow editors pushed them hard every day to bring the best pictures to our readers			0
a photojournalist knows how hard it is to record history when the authorities try to limit or prevent you from doing so			0
but these guys could get anywhere , they knew everybody , and they had the uncanny ability to somehow be in the right place when news broke			0
@entity24 photographers ran toward chaos , they placed themselves and their cameras as close as possible to the action without fail			1
i looked up to them			0
i wanted to be one of them			0
my first moments as a journalist were as a news photographer for my college newspaper , @entity85 , 25 years ago			0
i wanted to be a shooter at the @entity24 because that was a place that valued the power of hard news photography			1
photographer @entity90 , who won a @entity91 at the newspaper in 1982 , famously said , " it is a privilege to be a photojournalist			1
" and it is an extraordinary privilege			0
@entity90 told me a few years ago that he enjoys being the eyes to the world and bringing the eyes of the world to what he has seen			0
watch : @entity90 talks about video story telling media watchers have noted that the @entity24 ' new publisher , @entity103 , had committed a similar mass firing of all news photographers at @entity106 in 2008			1
@entity103 is using his power to crush a guild - protected workforce in favor of freelance talent			0
freelancers and staff reporters will carry the burden of creating original news images from places where it 's hard to take great pictures			1
the freelancers , presumably , will be carrying professional camera gear , while the reporters will be trained how to do double duty by using smartphones for visual news gathering and video packages			1
smartphones replace point and shoot cameras , they replace consumer - level video cams , they replace pro audio recorders			1
but smartphones ca n't replace digital single lens reflex cameras -- and especially ca n't replace the talent and experience required to make pictures for many types of newspaper assignments			1
i have filed video reports from student protests in @entity141 with a smartphone , and i have reported in stills with @entity144 and " fast glass , " or fast lenses , from disaster scenes			0
the tools evolve , but they all have their own applications and abilities			0
the demands for print reproduction quality are much higher than for digital , so it is an open question how much of this new smartphone photography will actually be good enough to make it to the print editions			1
when i train journalists to tell visual stories with smartphones , their output is meant for digital audiences and is an adjunct to the work of the dedicated pros carrying better gear			1
but at the end of the day , quality storytelling matters , regardless of the form or who does the work			2
news consumers expect high quality when they pay for professional journalism from a @entity178 brand that built its reputation on stellar news photography			2
@entity90 's work hangs in a private art gallery in the newsroom of the @entity24			1
it joins a collection more than 150 powerful news photographs that the photo staff of the paper produced over six decades -- a reminder for the employees who still work there of what their paper once stood for and accomplished			1
it is a shame that the public ca n't see this museum - quality exhibit			2
it is a breathtaking tour through @entity178 's history seen through the eyes of some very brave witnesses			0
the photos are there , but the brave witnesses will no longer be in the building			0
so , what 's been lost ? a tradition of fearlessness , bravery , courage , knowledge and trust that was decades in the making			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			2

@entity24 fired its whole photography staff of 28
@entity215 : paper was known for photojournalism , won @entity91
will use freelancers and smartphones , he says . digital images are n't up to print *standards*
@entity228 : but nothing can replace their guts , experience and quality of their work
