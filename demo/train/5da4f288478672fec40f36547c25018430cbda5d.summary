-- lately i 've been hearing wailing sounds in the distance from members of what 's been dubbed @entity6 over the prospect of beginning their collective sixth decade in two years			1
their keening blends with that of their immediate predecessors , the baby boomers , who have for almost 20 years been grousing about their passage through and beyond their 50s			1
that 's long enough to regret not only " being over , " but to regard even the notion of being over as being over			2
but what exactly is " over " when you 're past 50 ? unless you 're , like , you know , dead			0
blame it on the veneration of youth that media and marketers have been feeding us from the time boomers began their fearsome march across this blue planet after @entity31 to be young was to be exalted , embraced , catered to and , to bemused elders , feared			0
once you were past 50 , you were no longer as important as you once were to people selling beer , fast food and clothing , which implied you were no longer as important to the culture , with relatively little to contribute or to inspire in others			0
but what 's this ? @entity42 's front pages now proclaim a 64 - year - old woman as their newest hero ? and she did what ? really ? yes , really			2
after four previous attempts , all curtailed by some combination of bad weather , hostile seas and sea life , @entity46 finally completed a record - setting , 100 - plus - mile , nonstop swim from @entity55 to @entity56			1
she was the first swimmer to make such an epochal trip without the aid of a shark cage , reaching the shores of @entity61 roughly 53 hours after leaving @entity62 off the coast of @entity64			0
two days and change seem like the proverbial drop in the ocean when compared with the 35 years , almost half her life , spent pursuing this grail			0
she had other things taking up her time : writing books , training athletes and breaking long - distance records			0
but the @entity55 - to - @entity56 feat took its not - so - sweet time coming to pass			1
even so , she did n't let age or time daunt or disqualify her			0
this was one bona fide baby boomer who was going to insist to all the subsequent generations that she , at least , was n't over and done			2
as galvanic as @entity46 's triumph has been to the world at large , even those who do n't care a whit about athletic pursuits , it 's been especially gratifying to those of us who belong to the baby boom generation and believe that we still have worthwhile , even astonishing things to contribute to the global imagination			1
( and in case there 's any doubt about her boomer creds , @entity46 sharpened her focus during her arduous journey by keeping the music of her generation front and center in her head -- mostly @entity106 songs and , if i 've heard radio reports correctly , " @entity109 of @entity110 " from the 1960s tv sitcom " @entity110			1
" ) after @entity55 - @entity56 feat , @entity46 to swim 48 hours in @entity113 but @entity46 is only confirming what those reaching middle age with more left to give have long been discovering			1
in fact , the past few weeks have brought comparably striking ( though somber ) reminders of how one 's relevance can continue to ever more glowing terms past one 's 20s and 40s			0
between august 18 and 20 , we lost three notable artists , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128			2
@entity126 and @entity129 , both of whom were vitally connected with jazz music and education , were in their 90s , while @entity127 , who was writing best - selling , critically acclaimed crime fiction as recently as a year ago , was 89			1
as with @entity46 , all three worked hard and made reputations for themselves up till their 40s and then outdid those accomplishments in the second stretch of their lives			2
the @entity145 - born @entity128 first achieved cult status as a @entity148 nightclub pianist throughout the 1950s and 1960s , while @entity127 spent most of those same decades writing @entity150 novels and stories , some of which were made into @entity155 movies , including 1957 's " @entity156 " and " 3:10 to @entity157			1
" @entity126 spent much of his 19 - year @entity159 career studying literature and writing fiction			0
he did n't start writing full time until he retired in 1962 at age 46 and in 1970 published his first book of essays , " the omni - americans , " when he was 54			0
for the next 30 years , @entity126 became one of the most influential of @entity169 novelists and men of letters , using an elegiac imagination , informed passion for jazz music and broad knowledge of 20th - century literature			0
@entity127 's reputation likewise grew during the 1970s as a crime writer blessed with mordant wit and a keen ear for @entity169 speech at all social levels			1
but it was n't until 1985 that he , at 60 , became a semi-regular fixture on the best - seller lists with the publication of " glitz			0
" he would continue to amaze readers as diverse as @entity189 and @entity190			0
in his 80s , @entity127 achieved even greater renown working on the @entity193 " justified , " based on his novels about a laconic , sure - shot @entity42 marshal named @entity196			1
@entity46 's jellyfish - proof face mask @entity129 's reputation in the jazz world may have been firmly established by the time her weekly " @entity201 " interview series premiered on @entity202 in june 1978 when she was 60			1
but it was through the show 's years -- through 2011 , when she finally stepped down as the host -- that @entity128 revealed herself as an illuminating , charming and incisive guide through the mysteries of improvisation and seemed to grow artistically from her weekly encounters with musicians ranging from @entity211 and @entity212 to @entity213 and @entity214			0
so though one suspects @entity46 's far from through in amazing the onlookers , add her to these recently departed as stirring exemplars of the second or even third wind			1
she 's setting the pace for one generation -- and two years from now , the next generation of fiftysomethings should have sufficient reason to charge its own batteries for whatever wave comes by -- and wherever it takes them			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 .			2

@entity229 : @entity6 soon to join baby boomers in grousing about getting older
he says @entity46 's feat proves baby boomers have second wind
he says each generation has late - in - life exemplars , such as @entity127
@entity241 : @entity46 likely not done amazing us ; coming generations should follow her example
