@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 and the @entity3 are engaged in a strange and increasingly public tug of war			1
@entity0 has been adamant that it does n't need money from abroad to stay afloat despite a crisis in its banking sector			2
however , the republic 's central bank governor admitted thursday that the country was likely to accept a loan from the @entity3 and @entity12			1
speaking on the phone from @entity16 , @entity1 's @entity14 governor @entity13 told @entity1 broadcaster @entity18 that a loan worth " tens of billions of euros " is " definitely likely to happen			1
" " market conditions have not allowed us to go ahead without seeking the support of our international collaborators so that is what 's ahead , " he said , ahead of high - level talks between the @entity1 government and the @entity12 and @entity24 talks in @entity0 thursday			1
they are there to investigate what aid , if any , is needed and whether all that is required is a loan guarantee			0
so it 's a loan , not a bailout ? the central bank governor was very specific in his terminology			2
" when you are talking about the @entity12 , the @entity12 talks about loans -- not bailouts			1
loans get repaid so there has n't been a bailout from the @entity12			1
shareholders in the @entity12 -- which are governments -- get their return on the money that they have advanced to the @entity12 , " @entity13 said			0
before @entity13 's statement , all talk was about the pressure the @entity3 was putting on @entity1 to accept a rescue package as the euro took a battering on contagion fears			1
the worry was -- and still is -- that @entity1 's problems could exert further pressure on other ailing countries , namely @entity60 and @entity61 , which are already struggling to pay their debuts			1
relief in @entity1 would bring yields on @entity60 and @entity61 government bonds back to normal levels would mean they pay less on interest and more , hopefully , toward reducing their own deficits			2
@entity70 estimates banking - related costs will eventually mount to some 30 percent of @entity1 gdp			2
" on a banking crisis ' @entity75 ' this is a ' very severe crisis ' of about seven to eight out of 12 , " director of sovereign risk @entity77 said in a briefing note			0
for comparison , that is less severe than the @entity82 banking crisis ( 10 to 12 ) , but more serious than the banking tremors in the @entity84 and the @entity85 ( four to five )			0
so why was @entity1 resisting aid ? as recently as wednesday , @entity1 's finance minister @entity87 was insisting that the country 's banks had " no funding difficulties			2
" by thursday , he was being quoted as saying that a substantial contingency fund from the @entity3 and @entity12 would be a " very desirable outcome			1
" the government has resisted the idea of a financial aid package because it would inevitably come with strings attached			0
the country 's low 12.5 percent corporation tax rate was a point of contention			0
@entity1 has said the tax is " non-negotiable " despite complaints from other @entity3 members that the tax gives the country and an unfair advantage when it comes to attracting business			1
@entity1 's 2011 budget is due out on december 7 and the government has been keen to stress that it will include sufficient spending cuts to get the country back in shape without outside help			1
how did @entity1 get into this mess ? @entity1 recorded stunning economic growth during what is known as the " @entity118 " era from around 1993 to 2007 when the global financial crisis hit			0
@entity1 banks , like others around the world , loaned money to people who in some cases could n't pay it back			2
cheap loans created extra demand for housing and as prices surged the construction industry raced to build more			1
" the building frenzy was , in reality , driven by the ambitions and actions of developers and speculators , supported by banks hungry for quick profits , pro-growth local authorities afraid to be left behind , and a government greedy for the indirect , cyclic taxes the construction sector generated , " according to a recent report from the @entity145 and @entity146 ( @entity147 )			0
according to central bank figures released on november 17 , the number of mortgage loans in arrears has jumped by 11 percent since the end of june			0
at the end of september , more than 40,000 mortgage loans had been in arrears for more than 90 days			0
combined , the mortgage loans are worth â‚¬ 7.8 billion ( $ 10.6b )			0
@entity2 's @entity156 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 bailed out its struggling banks , putting the government under intense budget pressure
@entity14 governor says an @entity3 - @entity12 loan is " definitely likely "
@entity0 *reluctant* to call the loan a " bail - out "
problems caused by cheap loans which *fueled* demand for housing
