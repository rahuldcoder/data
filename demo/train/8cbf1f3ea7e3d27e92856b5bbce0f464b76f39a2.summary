@entity0 -- @entity2 , the mayor of @entity4 , and @entity5 , the city 's representative in the state legislature , saw potential in an historic , amoeba - shaped park parcel near the city 's convention center			1
so , the two set to work			2
they secured the civic support , government approval and funding needed to turn @entity15 into a place where playgrounds and mixed income housing will one day overlook a grassy span and the @entity20 â € ” an observation tower marking the park 's location as the site of the 1968 @entity25			2
as president @entity31 's choice to become the next housing secretary , a focus on helping revitalize inner - city areas , colleagues in @entity27 say , will stand the 39 - year - old mayor in good stead			1
" based on his focus here in @entity4 on working to improve housing in the city 's core and inner city , i suspect he would advance an agenda that has in mind family and children , " said @entity5 , who is vying to replace @entity2 as mayor			1
" i think you 're going to be seeing a secretary of housing who understands housing on a human level			2
" @entity31 's new pick for @entity52 secretary if confirmed , @entity2 would head an agency that is still reeling from fallout from the housing crisis â € ” including meeting mushrooming demands for affordable rental housing			1
he will also be tasked with helping the financially beleaguered @entity58 , which has been struggling to cope with a record number of home mortgage defaults			0
@entity31 noted during the nomination ceremony that @entity2 " never forgets where he comes from			1
" he also highlighted @entity2 's mention of his @entity65 - born grandmother in his keynote address to the @entity68 convention in 2012 as an immigrant who worked hard to provide a home for her family			1
" for her and generations like her a home is more than just a house , " @entity31 said			0
@entity2 will likely face questions in his confirmation hearings why @entity4 did not follow federal guidelines when it spent millions in @entity52 funds aimed at helping address the housing crisis during his tenure as mayor , according to a 2012 report by the agency 's inspector general			1
the report found the city did not use a competitive bid process when it awarded $ 2.5 million for renovation contracts and that it did not follow federal affordability guidelines designed to target lower income residents when it spent just over $ 1 million to buy and fix up homes			0
a call to @entity2 's @entity4 office seeking comment about his @entity52 nomination was not immediately returned			1
still , supporters feel @entity2 has the right mix of experience to lead the agency			1
" this economy has not been as robust as we would have hoped , " @entity103 , a former @entity52 secretary and former @entity4 mayor told @entity1 on friday			1
" part of the reason for that has been because the housing sector has been on the sidelines			2
but now housing can get into the fray and , as @entity52 secretary , @entity2 is well - poised to do that			1
" @entity103 , who says he has discussed housing - related issues with @entity2 in the past and plans on having additional conversations with him , said that as mayor of @entity4 , the younger man dealt with issues of poverty , homelessness and home affordability and is well suited to the task			1
opinion : why @entity2 said yes to @entity31 @entity27 political consultant @entity129 also feels @entity2 is up to the challenge			1
" he 'll be a cool customer			0
he 's not going to get supercharged or over wrought over anything , " said @entity129 who is a founding partner at @entity131 in @entity132 , a state political consulting group			0
" if there have been problems and challenges at the agency he 's not going to be let 's throw the baby out with the bathwater			0
" @entity2 's appointment also would be a win for @entity68 looking to add diversity to its national roster of potential candidates and put @entity27 in play in 2016 as well as help smooth over tensions with @entity150 who are frustrated over a lack of an immigration reform overhaul , said @entity154 , a @entity155 historian and @entity1 contributor			1
" in terms of the @entity68 and @entity31 , it is at least symbolic of the party 's commitment to immigration and immigration reform , " @entity154 said			2
" it does elevate his status			0
it makes him a national figure rather than a local figure			0
" @entity2 , the son of political activists , is the youngest mayor of a major @entity170 city			2
his meteoric rise from local government to being called upon to take on a cabinet - level position is a political narrative tailor - made for primetime			0
he and his twin brother , rep. @entity176 , @entity176 , were picked to take the stage at the @entity178 in @entity179			0
the congressman introduced his brother who in turn gave a keynote address that was memorable for both his young daughter 's charming hair flip and his tale of a second - generation , @entity65 - @entity170 immigrant 's successful rise			0
" my grandmother never owned a house			0
she cleaned other people 's houses so she could afford to rent her own			0
but she saw her daughter become the first in her family to graduate from college , " he said during the 2012 address			0
" and my mother fought hard for civil rights so that instead of a mop , i could hold this microphone			0
" mayors ' stories out of school beyond the immigrant son - made - good narrative , @entity2 brings a " new energy " to the president 's second term , said @entity211 , a @entity68 @entity27 state representative who heads that body 's @entity212			1
" it 's very important to note is that he brings a fresh perspective and new energy to this president 's second term , @entity214 said			2
" he could serve as a pick me up for an administration that 's been in place for some time			0

@entity2 is a @entity68 rising star *tapped* by president to head @entity52
his appointment could help improve @entity68 standing with @entity150 , @entity27 *voters*
@entity2 will face questions about @entity52 funds , steering it through housing market *recovery*
@entity27 colleagues say @entity2 has the right blend of experience to get the job done
