@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's a date etched in the minds of every @entity1 -- september 21 , 2013			1
at the upscale @entity7 shopping mall in @entity0 , a youth cooking competition was underway , friends laughed as they sipped coffee and families strolled idly through supermarket aisles			2
but the relaxing saturday afternoon was shattered when gunmen descended upon the five - storey facility shooting shoppers indiscriminately			0
the siege would last four days and the carnage would leave at least 67 people dead			0
when the terror attack began , @entity18 was one of the first people on the scene			1
as the head of @entity1 @entity23 , he is on the front line of emergency response when disaster strikes in the country -- and this was no exception			1
" it 's something that we never expected , " @entity18 says			1
" we always knew that something may happen , a terror attack -- i think there had been a heightened alert of terror possibility in the country in the last two , three years -- but what i can say is that when it did happen ... we acquitted ourselves very well from an emergency response point of view , " he adds			1
" it happened at about 12:30 and by about 1:15 we were there			0
" @entity18 says that day changed his life forever			2
taking lead on the scene , he coordinated teams of paramedics , life support ambulances and a psychosocial unit to offer support to families of those injured or killed during the terror attack			1
community support is paramount in emergency situations , and during @entity56 says that he could n't have asked for a better response			0
after setting up mobile blood donation clinics , @entity1 banded together to help in whatever way they could			2
" they gave blood ; they gave money ; anything that they could give they were out there to give , " he says			0
" companies came on board , individuals came on board			0
" six months on and the @entity23 secretary general is able to reflect on how the aid group can continue to improve following the @entity7 attack			1
" the lesson learned is that they need to be better prepared , better coordination with the security forces , with the government , " says @entity18			2
" since then we 've taken a backseat and now are working more closely with hospitals -- as the second - line providers ... we know which hospitals can get what type of person , so today if this were to happen , i know where to take the patients and we 're going to do more drills with this hospital			0
" but since then as @entity1 @entity23 , even our own fast response emergency ambulance services and training , we have moved on another level up from then to now			1
" a life of dedication born in @entity1 's north eastern province of @entity97 , @entity18 lost both his parents when he was just five years old			1
raised by his adoptive parents in the coastal city of @entity101 , he says these early events instilled a need to give back , which is part of why he began volunteering with the @entity23 at 14 years old			1
over 40 years have passed and the 55 - year - old humanitarian is still working as hard as ever			0
on top of his leading role in @entity1 @entity23 , he is also the vice president of the @entity23 and @entity23 , a position he holds since his election in november last year			1
" i would say what ticks me and what makes me continue doing this job is the ability and the opportunity it offers me to be able to make a difference in the lives of ordinary people who are vulnerable , " he says			0
" the ability to bring back hope to them , to give them back their dignity , to have a smile on their face , to have little kids who can have a basic normal life			0
" during @entity18 's tenure in @entity1 @entity23 , the disaster response organization has grown from an underfunded society to one which now operates with more than $ 23 million in assets			1
he has established response centers and increased the number of available emergency vehicles with specialized equipment for advanced life support -- run out of @entity0 , the organization controls 53 ambulances , with another 75 arriving in june , and also leases emergency vehicles to counties that ca n't afford to purchase their own			0
' out of the box ' ideas with so many life - saving initiatives to finance , and an increasing number of international , regional and local ngos fighting also for the same pie , @entity18 is often having to get creative when it comes to working out where to get the money his operations require			1
" you have to think out of the box to see how you would take this to the next level , " he says , citing the " crazy idea " of @entity23 opening three hotels , including @entity154 , a luxurious hotel in @entity0			0
" it 's the first in this country , the first in the region , the first in many parts of the world that today the @entity23 owns and runs a five - star hotel , " he says			2
" any surpluses or profits that the hotel may make , every penny then is brought back into the humanitarian work of the @entity23			2
" despite his many successes , @entity18 says there is still work to be done as he continues to strive for improvements in the emergency medicine field and for more locally - generated funding schemes			2
" i want to see a day where there is less aid coming from outside and more being generated locally , " he says			0
" where the @entity181 governments would see their national institutions as the first port of call or their preferred choice of partners that can do as good , if not a better , job than what international @entity146 would do			0
