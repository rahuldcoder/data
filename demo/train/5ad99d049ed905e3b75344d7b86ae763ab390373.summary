-- the @entity2 and @entity3 are " absolutely in sync " about the need to prevent @entity6 from acquiring a nuclear weapon , secretary of state @entity1 said friday			1
talk of @entity6 's nuclear program took center stage in close to nine hours of talks thursday and friday between @entity1 and @entity3 prime minister @entity12			1
@entity1 met with @entity12 for the first time since the @entity2 and five other world powers reached a deal with @entity6 over its nuclear program			1
his talks aimed to convince the @entity3 leader to move beyond the " first step " deal and work on a comprehensive agreement that addresses all of @entity3 's concerns about @entity6 's program			1
once just speculation , differences between the @entity2 and @entity3 on how to deal with @entity6 's nuclear program have spilled into an open rift between the two allies			1
@entity12 has accused international powers that reached a deal with @entity6 to curb its nuclear program of making a " historic mistake " that could put @entity3 in grave danger			1
the agreement calls for the easing of economic sanctions on @entity6 in exchange for increased inspections and limits on the country 's uranium enrichment program , which many international analysts fear is meant for military purposes			0
the @entity3 leader wants to eliminate @entity6 's capability entirely , rather than merely suspend @entity46 's nuclear development			2
he is adamantly opposed to any enrichment on @entity6 soil , but this week @entity49 , the lead @entity2 negotiator for the @entity6 talks , said @entity51 would be willing to consider a limited , closely monitored @entity6 enrichment program			2
" the prime minister has every right in the world to make his views known with respect to his concerns about the security of his country , " @entity1 said upon leaving @entity3 , but he added that @entity12 " has been extremely constructive on the next steps and where we need to go now			1
" " he knows that we are now in the real negotiation , " @entity1 said of @entity12			0
he noted that the interim deal freezes the @entity6 enrichment program , while a comprehensive agreement is negotiated , and it expands the amount of time by which @entity6 could develop a breakout capacity			2
" i am personally convinced without any reasonable doubt that @entity3 is safer today , " as a result of the interim agreement , he said			1
in public remarks after his private meeting with @entity12 , @entity1 said the @entity2 remains committed to @entity3 's security			1
" i ca n't emphasize enough that @entity3 's security in this negotiation is at the top of our agenda , " @entity1 said			2
" and the @entity2 will do everything in our power to make certain that @entity6 's nuclear program -- a program of weaponization possibilities -- is terminated			2
world powers have imposed a six - month deadline for a final deal			0
" we agree on what the goal of the final status agreement ought to be , " @entity1 said			0
" and in the days and weeks ahead , we will consult very closely and continually with our @entity3 friends in order to bring about a comprehensive agreement that can withstand everybody 's test			0
" @entity3 - @entity98 peace this marked @entity1 's eighth trip to the region , making yet another push for a peace deal between @entity3 and @entity98			1
after his talks with @entity12 and @entity98 president @entity105 , @entity1 said the leaders remain " as determined as ever " to negotiate a peace deal			1
he said he believed the parties were " closer than ever " to realizing a two - state solution			0
@entity1 said the perseverance of former @entity113 president @entity112 's fight for equality and justice should be a model to skeptics of the prospects for peace			0
" the naysayers are wrong to call peace in this region an impossible goal			0
it always seems impossible until it is done , " he said			0
he kicked off talks in july , but in november , both sides dug into their decades - old trenches and passed around blame			0
israelis and @entity98 are four months into a nine - month deadline given to them by @entity1 to reach a peace deal , with little visible progress			1
with direct negotiations between the two sides flailing , the @entity2 seems to have moved into a more muscular role as mediator by presenting its own bridging proposals to the parties instead of relying on the @entity3 and @entity98 to negotiate among themselves , which has born little fruit			1
on thursday , @entity2 gen. @entity141 presented @entity12 with a detailed plan to address @entity3 's security needs in the event of a comprehensive peace agreement			1
" neither peace nor prosperity is possible without security , " he said , adding that the @entity2 will " only support a final status agreement that makes both @entity3 and the @entity98 safer than they are today			1
" on thursday , @entity12 said that @entity3 is " ready for a historic peace " based on a two - state solution but that his country 's security needs must be respected			2
he said finger - pointing that helped derail the earlier talks must end			0
security is a must if @entity3 is going to sign on , @entity12 said			0
" @entity3 must be able to defend itself by itself			0
" he appeared to be referring to the @entity159 , where @entity3 has insisted its own troops must remain , as opposed to the international troops that patrol the tense borders with @entity163 and @entity164			0
@entity98 have rejected , out of hand , @entity3 soldiers within the borders of their own states			2
by echoing @entity12 's language that a peace deal must recognize @entity3 as " a country that can defend itself by itself , " @entity1 appeared to be siding with @entity3			1
" what we need is not grandstanding but understanding , " he said			0
@entity98 have argued that @entity3 has been sowing distrust by continuing the construction of thousands of jewish settlement units on the @entity178 and other land that @entity98 claim as theirs			2
it is the real source of the " deep crisis between the @entity98 and the @entity3 negotiations team , " a @entity98 official said			0
@entity0 's @entity184 and @entity185 contributed to this report .			0
