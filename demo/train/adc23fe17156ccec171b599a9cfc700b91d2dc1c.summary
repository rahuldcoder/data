@entity0 , @entity1 -- using dna to catch criminals has become common , but police in @entity0 , @entity1 , this year demonstrated how the practice can be taken to a new level : they tracked down a suspect not through his dna , but through that of his brother			1
here 's how it happened , the @entity0 district attorney 's office said : in february 2008 , two cars were broken into			1
police found blood at both scenes and ran the samples through dna databases but could n't find a match			1
then , as part of a study being conducted by the district attorney 's office , investigators used new software to see whether the dna in the blood was close enough to potentially be from a family member of someone in the criminal dna database			1
the software came up with six potential matches			0
five did n't pan out , but one led police to a convicted car thief and , ultimately , that man 's brother , @entity36			1
@entity36 pleaded guilty in september to one count of criminal trespass and received a sentence of two years ' probation			2
attempts to contact @entity36 for this report were unsuccessful			0
district attorney @entity43 called it one of the first cases in the country to use software to find familial dna matches			1
" our hope here is to show that it works , which we have done , " he said			0
" i think it 's a valuable way to generate leads			1
" @entity43 's office developed the software tool with the @entity0 police , he said			1
he hopes to use it to solve murders , rapes and cold cases			0
the matches to family members wo n't be used as evidence itself , he said , but rather as a way to generate leads for investigators to explore , similar to the way police may use a witness report of a partial license plate			1
" there 's no reason to bring this into court , " @entity43 said			2
" you use the science , you use the @entity3 , then you use a conventional investigation			2
" but some privacy advocates are crying foul			0
" family members have done nothing wrong to get in the database , " said @entity83 defense attorney @entity82			1
" and this is an example of the web of suspicion of people who have committed offenses being widened to include their entire family			0
" @entity82 has been fighting familial dna searches since 2003			0
he was part of an effort that led to @entity83 being the first state to outlaw familial dna searches			0
" people have a reasonable expectation of privacy of their dna , " he said			1
" it 's a basic violation of the @entity100 of the @entity101 " @entity43 disagrees			0
" i 've yet to hear anyone explain how this is a violation of the @entity101 , " he said			0
" the bad guy abandoned the dna at the crime scene			1
they have no expectation of privacy			2
" @entity82 also argued that even though the technique may be successful in certain cases , that does n't mean it is worth potential infringements on constitutional rights			0
" if they want to drive down the street and do no - knock searches of homes , they would catch bad guys , " he said			0
" but at what cost to our society ? " @entity43 hopes to have his office 's familial dna study completed sometime in the coming year			1
in @entity1 , the criminal dna database includes people convicted of felonies			1
in the fall of 2010 @entity1 will begin taking dna samples at the time a person is charged with a felony			2
if a person is found not guilty or if charges are dropped , he or she can request to have the samples removed from the database			2
@entity82 said that 's a slippery slope			0
" where it leads is toward the development of a universal database from the time they are born , " he said			2
" they want everyone in the database			0

@entity0 police this year tracked down a car theft suspect using his brother 's dna
investigators compared blood dna from the scene to records in a criminal database
@entity159 says the method is n't for the courtroom , but for *building* leads in an investigation
a defense attorney says it violates a person 's " reasonable expectation of privacy "
