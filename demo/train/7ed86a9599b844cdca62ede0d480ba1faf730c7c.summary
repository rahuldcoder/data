-- sugar lovers may have to face a bitter truth : the less sugar added to foods for typical people , the better are their blood - fat profiles and the lower are their cardiovascular risks , a study to be published wednesday concludes			1
" we found that the lower the amount of added sugar people ate , the better their good cholesterol and their blood triglyceride levels , " said co-author dr. @entity9 , assistant professor of pediatrics at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , and author of " the @entity15 for kids			1
" unfortunately for dessert lovers , the converse is true			0
increased sugars are associated with important cardiovascular disease risk factors , according to the report			1
the authors cited lower levels of @entity29 , which is sometimes referred to as the good cholesterol , and higher levels of triglycerides			1
the study , to be published in the @entity34 , highlights a trend some nutritionists consider disturbing : in recent years , the typical @entity38 's diet has increasingly incorporated added sugars			1
the authors defined them as " caloric sweeteners used by the food industry and consumers as ingredients in processed or prepared foods to increase the desirability of those foods			0
" data from the mid- 1990s show that 15.8 percent of the typical @entity38 's diet was composed of added sugar -- 21.4 teaspoons or 359 calories per day			1
that 's up from 10.6 percent in 1977 - 1978			2
added sugars have been linked to obesity , diabetes and tooth decay			2
the researchers studied 6,113 adults enrolled in the @entity58			0
interviewers called them and asked what they had eaten the previous day , then estimated the total added sugar in each person 's diet			1
participants were then separated into groups : those who got less than 5 percent of total calories from added sugar ; 5 percent to less than 10 percent ; 10 percent to less than 17.5 percent ; 17.5 percent to less than 25 percent ; and 25 percent or more			1
those in the highest - consuming added sugar group eat about 46 teaspoons of added sugar per day , the study said			1
those who consumed more added sugar tended to be younger , @entity75 blacks with low income , it said			1
the report says 18.5 percent of @entity38 get at least 25 percent of their calories from added sugar			1
the strongest relationship between added sugar and blood fats was found in values for @entity29 , which fell from 58.7 mg / dl for those who ate the least added sugar to 47.7 mg / dl for those who ate the most			1
a higher hdl - c level is associated with a lower cardiovascular risk			1
among some blood fats linked to higher cardiovascular risk , the converse was true : triglyceride levels went from 105 mg / dl in the group that ate the least sugar to 114 mg / dl in the group that ate the most			1
the so - called bad cholesterol , @entity97 , went from 116 mg / dl for women who ate the least sugar to 123 mg / dl for women who ate the most			2
there were no significant trends for @entity97 among men			0
the authors concluded that their data support dietary guidelines that aim to cut consumption of added sugar			1
but those guidelines are all over the map			0
the @entity110 recommends no more than 25 percent of total energy from added sugars ; the @entity113 recommends less than 10 percent ; and the @entity114 has recently advised no more than 100 calories per day for women and 150 calories per day for men , which works out to about 5 percent			0
" what it really means is we have to go back to things like whole grains and vegetables and fruit and eat things in moderation in order to be healthy , " @entity119 said			0
" plus , a good healthy dose of activity			0
" but the study compiled data based on a single day 's consumption , and it was not clear whether that day was representative of other days , she said			2
" we do n't know that all of the people had their usual diet the day before , " she said			0
" there are always some weaknesses in that kind of data			0
" carbohydrates have been linked for decades to abnormal blood fat levels , " but a big contemporary issue is added sugars , " said dr. @entity148 , professor of nutrition at @entity150 in @entity151 , @entity152			2
@entity119 ' study " fills in a gap in the science base			0
" the study will likely be discussed next month when the @entity114 takes up the matter of added sugars at its meeting in @entity159 , he said			2
" we just overeat too damn much , " he said			0
" what this study is saying is that , for some groups -- especially young people , black , poor -- sugar is just way too big a proportion of their intake			2
" " the real truth is that we 're supposed to eat a balanced diet , less processed food , " said @entity169 , a nutritionist at the @entity170 at @entity171 in @entity172 and assistant professor at @entity175 's @entity174			0
@entity169 praised the study for its size and careful construction			0
but dr. @entity182 , a diabetes specialist based in @entity183 , @entity172 , was unimpressed			0
" this is just one more study showing that carbohydrates create abnormal lipid profiles , " he said .			0
