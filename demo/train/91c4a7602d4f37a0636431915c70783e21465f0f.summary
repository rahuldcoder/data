-- few things enrage normally calm people like finding a parking ticket tucked under the windshield wiper of their car			1
parking tickets can be infuriating , especially when they seem undeserved			1
( officer , there 's no sign saying i ca n't park here ! )			0
but most people do n't want to invest the time and energy to would take to dispute them			0
now there 's a new @entity18 app , fixed , that will fight parking tickets for you			1
the app , expected to launch next week , will do the heavy lifting of contesting a ticket : suggesting reasons it might be invalid , gathering supporting evidence and submitting the proper appeals paperwork			1
if the driver beats the ticket , they pay fixed 25 % of what the citation would have cost			1
if they ca n't get out of the ticket , @entity33 does n't charge them anything			1
in this way , @entity33 hopes to add navigating bureaucracy to the list of urban tasks and nuisances -- catching a cab , ordering food , finding a place to crash -- made easier by popular tech startups			1
" when you mention parking tickets to people it engenders such an emotional reaction ... because so many people think they 've received an unfair parking ticket , " said fixed co-founder @entity45 , who came up with the idea after getting six parking tickets in one day			1
much of this anger is directed at local governments , which many people see as using parking tickets to fill budget gaps			1
that emotional response , as well as a desire to not shell out $ 100 for blocking a couple inches of someone 's driveway , could make fixed a hit			2
but its success will depend on how good the service is at navigating parking laws , which are often a confusing hodgepodge of local and state ordinances			0
here 's how @entity33 works : when someone gets a ticket , they snap a photo of it on their @entity18 and enter the violation code			1
the fixed app will tell them what percentage of those types of tickets are usually overturned and then show a list of possible reasons it could be found invalid			2
for example , a street cleaning sign might be obscured by a leafy tree , or a parking meter could be broken			0
if the motorist thinks they have a case , the app will prompt them to capture any additional photographic evidence with their phone and then digitally sign a letter			0
@entity33 has contracted with a team of legal researchers fluent in local traffic laws who will review each case before printing out the letter and submitting it via snail mail to the city			2
over time , @entity33 hopes to learn more about what methods and which errors have the highest success rates when contesting tickets			1
that information will be used to make the system more automated			0
" it will always be reviewed by human eyes before it 's sent , but i 'm pretty confident that we can get to the point where 80 % of tickets are 95 % automated , " said @entity45			2
@entity33 is expected to launch in the @entity117 next week , although its service will only be available in @entity120 at first			1
the startup has been testing its service with a small group of 1,000 people , mostly friends and friends of friends , and there 's already a waiting list of 25,000 people wanting to sign up			0
@entity45 and with @entity33 's other two co-founders , @entity130 and @entity131 , hope to expand into the top 100 @entity133 cities over the next 18 months			1
@entity120 is fertile ground for motorists who can effortlessly rack up hundreds of dollars in parking tickets			1
as in many cities , parking in @entity120 is an exercise in frustration , with a limited number of spaces on the street and parking garages charging top dollar			1
the company has n't had any official talks with the city			0
but @entity45 hopes his service is not seen as adversarial			0
rather , he thinks @entity33 could help people pay their legitimate parking tickets in a more timely manner			1
" we do not have concerns if people want to use a third - party service , but there is no secret to overturning a citation if it has been issued erroneously			0
if someone feels that their citation was written in error , they might want to consider protesting themselves , for free , " said @entity159 , a spokesperson for @entity120 's transportation agency			2
@entity120 issues about 1.5 million parking tickets every year , typically for $ 45 to $ 115 each ( there are also some significantly pricier violations , such as having an expired plate or abandoning a car on a highway )			1
the fines add up to about $ 95 million a year , according to @entity45			0
of those 1.5 million citations , only five percent are actually contested			0
and of that small amount , only 30 % are actually overturned , according to @entity176			0
there are three rounds of appeals -- two by mail and a court hearing			0
@entity33 will only handle the first two appeals for the time being			2
the number of overall citations in @entity120 has fallen in recent years as the city has rolled out its own technological tools , such as pay - by - phone and meters that take credit cards , in an effort to make payment easier			2
" we 'd much rather have people pay the meter than pay a fine , " said @entity176			0
@entity33 's business model is n't completely new			2
there are companies that handle driving and parking violations for large corporations such as @entity202 and @entity203			0
in @entity205 , commercial delivery companies account for 20 % to 30 % of the city 's 10 million parking tickets every year , according to @entity209 's @entity208			1
the difference is that @entity33 is making this service available to individuals			2
@entity45 can see eventually expanding into speeding tickets and other small financial annoyances , such as cable company fees			0
he thinks @entity33 could help in any area where the fee amount is small enough not to protest in person , but still big enough to make someone angry			0
" that 's our sweet spot , " he said .			0

a new app , fixed , will contest parking tickets on a driver 's *behalf*
users submit a photo of their ticket and the app handles the legal paperwork
if @entity33 gets someone out of a ticket , it charges them 25 % of the ticket fine
@entity33 is rolling out in @entity120 first but hopes to expand to more cities
