-- with owners ranging from onetime @entity3 through @entity5 ruler @entity4 to the @entity6 herself , horse racing is known as the ' @entity8 ' for good reason			2
if you 're going to be a player , you 're likely to need near - limitless funds			0
occasionally though , a relative pauper does manage to gatecrash the party every once in a while			0
take @entity16 , who works as a hotel controller in @entity18 -- and who 's absolutely convinced of one thing			1
" i make no bones about the being the luckiest guy alive , " he volunteered within seconds of speaking to @entity0			0
it 's a big call that only seems more fanciful when you learn that @entity16 , 59 , has been granted a long - term medical leave of absence following surgery to treat prostate cancer			1
having bought into some 25 - 30 horses over the years , too many of which suffered from a case of the ' slows ' -- as he laughingly puts it -- @entity16 made a $ 5,000 transaction that would change his life			1
five years and $ 700,000 later , the expectation is that there 's plenty more to come			2
for when @entity16 chose to buy 5 % of a horse that nobody had wanted at a sales auction just weeks earlier , he bought a yearling that would not only win the most famous race in the @entity43 -- the @entity44 -- but also the world 's richest race -- the $ 10m @entity47			1
" when @entity50 went through sales in 2009 , no one bid on him so they brought him back and re-syndicated him			1
@entity52 -- the partnership that owned @entity50 -- syndicated him for $ 100,000 and i bought 5 % , " @entity16 expands			1
" on the racetrack , he earned $ 8.8m			2
" the numbers are as extraordinary as @entity50 's supreme career , which sparkled so brightly @entity16 could well receive another $ 1m in stud fees			1
in late 2012 , 75 % of @entity50 was sold to an @entity61 stud farm called @entity62 , which was chosen for its proven track record and because the deal allowed the horse 's investors to remain involved			1
three months later , the champion horse won the @entity47 -- with the success swiftly prompting @entity4 , whose entry had been beaten by @entity50 , to come on board			1
his @entity43 - based stud farm @entity73 bought a 29 % stake in @entity50 , with @entity75 owning 51 % , leaving @entity52 with the remaining 20 %			1
the figures are important because even though @entity16 now owns just 1 % of @entity50 , this slender stake should still be enough to ensure a pampered retirement			1
" there is no way you can explain how surreal this whole adventure has been , because we have n't made the real money yet , " he said			0
" his stud fee in @entity61 is $ 35,000 and he was recently mated to around 100 mares there			2
" at the end of the southern hemisphere season , he was shuttled to @entity90 and is currently in the middle of his first season there			0
" his @entity43 stud fee is $ 35,000 and it appears his @entity90 season will show him bred to 145 mares			2
" so he 'll generate between $ 7 - 9m in stud fees if he 's successful but you wo n't know that until the first crop race			1
then it could go up or down			0
but the fact he could generate $ 8 - 9m in fees for 10 - to 15 years is the most amazing part for me			2
" which means @entity16 could make a return in excess of 30,000 % on his investment			1
" one of the rules of investing is finding the smartest guy in any industry and grabbing onto their coattails , " said @entity16 , explaining his decision to invest in @entity50			1
" this success is all about @entity117 , the chairman of @entity52 , and i like to think the only smart thing i did was grab onto his coattails and hang on			0
" as with many racehorses , @entity50 's ownership was shared among a syndicate or , as it 's more commonly known in the @entity43 , a partnership			1
the practice allows several investors to own a share of a horse for an affordable price , one that also enables them to feel like owners as they attend a race day			2
the costs can vary greatly -- from as little as $ 140 in the @entity135 to take part in an sizable syndicate of 100 - odd investors to far heftier fees that start with a minimum investment of $ 42,000			2
" there are various ways that people come into racing , and syndicates are a good way of testing the water , " @entity141 , who runs the small @entity143 syndicate in northern @entity144 , told @entity0			0
" investors do n't have to make a great outlay , and they soon get a feel about whether they want to go any further			0
" @entity16 says his good fortune was to invest with @entity52 but he 's being modest , for he researched intensely before gambling on a man who also knew about leaps of faith			1
in 1969 , @entity52 chairman @entity117 gave up a fiction writing career to work as a horseracing journalist and broadcaster -- a role he exploited to the full			0
" i drove a lot of famous people nuts , asking them questions , " he says on @entity52 's website			2
" but there were things i wanted to know and i was in a perfect place to pester racing 's greats for answers			0
" nine years in , he used his acquired knowledge to become a bloodstock agent before then switching to operating a stable of syndicated racehorses in 1987			0
as a result of addressing conventional wisdom with a sledgehammer , @entity117 's reward has been a glut of glittering trophies			0
" what separates me from other people is that i only care about how the horses look and move -- namely , studying their athleticism and body , " he told @entity0			0
" most people are hung up on pedigree but when i started out , i did n't have that much money so that 's why we adopted our strategy			0
" so @entity117 relegated the importance of a horse 's lineage ( pedigree ) below talent , athleticism , soundness and temperament , and the results have been spectacular			2
@entity52 horses have won at least 25 grade 1 races around the world , but @entity117 feels @entity50 defines his approach			1
" he had a @entity207 sire , which nobody previously cared about , and a @entity210 mare			0
i went for it and bought both , did the mating and breeding , and thankfully it worked out , " he said			0
" when i buy a horse , i 'm looking for a particular style that will be effective			0
and i 'll tell you something i wo n't expand upon -- @entity43 racing is not about class , but about racing style and speed			0
" despite the gains he has made by largely ignoring pedigree , @entity117 says he does n't see anyone copying his approach			0
so it 's ironic that @entity52 's contrary policy will be further rewarded as wannabe grade 1 winners queue up to pay a small fortune for an @entity50 foal			1
all in the hope of sharing the parade rings and winners ' enclosures with some of the world 's most powerful people -- a holy grail @entity16 is still wholly surprised to be part of .			1

how investor 's $ 5,000 stake in a horse will return well over a *million* *dollars*
hotel controller @entity16 invested in @entity50 in 2009
horse has since won @entity44 and @entity47 , the sport 's richest race
@entity50 has now entered *lucrative* world of breeding
