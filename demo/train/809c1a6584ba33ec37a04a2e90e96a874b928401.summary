@entity0 -- attorneys for a " high - value " terror suspect who says he was tortured while being held at secret @entity5 prisons have requested that a judge bar the agency from destroying evidence of the alleged torture			1
one of 14 " high - value " detainees held at @entity11 , @entity12 , alleges he was tortured			0
the motion , filed by the @entity16 attorneys on behalf of @entity17 -- who is being held at @entity11 , @entity12 -- is dated november 29			2
that is a week before cia director @entity20 acknowledged the agency destroyed videotapes it made in 2002 of interrogations of @entity25 suspects using newly approved " alternative " interrogation techniques			0
@entity17 -- a native of @entity28 who attended high school in @entity30 -- was held for more than three years at the secret @entity5 prisons and " subjected to an aggressive @entity5 detention and interrogation program notable for its elaborate planning and ruthless application of torture , " attorney @entity27 claims in the court documents			1
details of @entity17 's torture claims are redacted in the filing -- a whole page is blacked out -- but @entity17 's attorneys say he suffers " severe physical and psychological trauma from which he is unlikely ever to recover fully " as a result of his ordeal			1
asked about @entity17 's claims , @entity5 spokesman @entity47 told @entity1 , " @entity5 's terrorist interrogation effort has always been small , carefully run , lawful and highly productive			1
fewer than 100 hardened terrorists have gone through the program since it began in 2002 , and of those , less than a third required any special methods of questioning			0
the @entity55 does not conduct or condone torture			1
" @entity17 's attorneys claim he was taken into custody in 2003 and " forcibly disappeared " before his transfer to @entity11 , " where he remains imprisoned without charge or trial			1
" he filed a legal challenge to his detention in september 2006 and appeared before a @entity65 in april , the court documents said			2
he was found to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant , but filed a challenge to that on august 14			0
he was not allowed to meet with an attorney , however , until october , the document said			0
the @entity72 administration contends @entity17 was an operative working for @entity73 , mastermind of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			1
@entity17 researched how to blow up gas stations and poison reservoirs in the @entity55 , the administration has said			1
he is among 14 " high - value " detainees held at @entity11			0
@entity27 and another @entity16 attorney , @entity78 , also released declassified notes of their meetings with @entity17 , saying he has been on hunger strikes while in @entity11 , is " painfully thin and pale " and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder			2
in detention , he has been able to communicate with @entity86 , an alleged lieutenant for @entity87 , they said in the notes			0
a government official with knowledge of the destroyed @entity5 tapes has said that @entity86 was one of the two @entity25 suspects whose interrogations were videotaped			0
while undergoing interrogation and torture by the @entity5 , " @entity17 admitted anything his interrogators demanded of him , regardless of the truth , in order to end his suffering , " the documents said			1
without a court order requiring the preservation of evidence , " there is substantial risk that the torture evidence will disappear " and that may affect the challenge to his detention , the attorneys claim			2
the motion was filed in the @entity112			0
@entity20 has said the @entity5 stopped videotaping in 2002 , while @entity17 was not taken into custody until the following year			2

" the information developed by the detention and interrogation program has been irreplaceable , and the program has operated in strict accord with @entity55 law			1
