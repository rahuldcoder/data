-- from @entity2 and @entity3 to @entity4 and @entity5 , these celebrity kiddos have totally inherited their mothers ' style smarts -- and so can you			1
@entity9 : big hair , do n't care even now that she 's ditched the hair extensions , @entity9 is the queen of the pop star mane			1
her hair has as much range as her vocals , and we can already see @entity17 following suit with her adorable " halo " of springy curls			0
and it 's just a matter of time before @entity2 picks up another of her mother 's fashion habits : wearing @entity26 heels			1
the designer created a pair of pink satin pumps especially for the tyke			1
@entity0 : 10 fashionable babies that will give north west a run for her money @entity35 & @entity37 @entity36 : all - natural is all goop good while @entity37 @entity36 's personal style is a bit trendier and more playful than mama @entity35 's typically streamlined wardrobe ( purple uggs are a favorite ) , the nine - year - old has definitely inherited her mother 's all - natural beauty and long , center - parted golden locks			1
in this day of " @entity50 , " there 's a lot to be said for that sort of simplicity			1
can we get her to guest - edit the next @entity57 newsletter ? @entity58 & @entity59 : go girly or go home here 's a mother / daughter duo that you 'll never see in sweats			1

it does n't get any girlier than this , but we totally love it			0
@entity0 : celebrities with the best winter style @entity79 & @entity80 : there 's no such thing as being overdressed it 's hard to believe that @entity79 is old enough to have a 14 - year - old daughter , but there you have it			1
perhaps it 's because teenage @entity80 always looks so mature and lady - like in the outfits she chooses , whether it 's a printed @entity91 shift or a bustier - topped gold cocktail dress			1
the girl 's growing up fast , but at least she 's found a good teacher in the art of going glam : dear ol ' mum			2
@entity98 & @entity3 : @entity99 knows best yes , @entity3 's had her diva phase ( those tiny heels ! those designer bags ! )			1
now , the seven - year - old and her mother @entity98 have become unofficial spokespeople for @entity104 and its @entity107 children 's line			1
whether it 's oversized sweaters , floral leggings , or sweet sundresses , @entity98 's mini-me is big on preppy , all - american style piecesâ € ” though accessorizing with a @entity110 fur gilet now and again does n't hurt			1
@entity0 : how to dress like an it girl @entity117 & @entity118 : when in doubt , go with givenchy it helps to have parents who are joined at the hip with @entity124 creative director @entity123			0
not only has the designer been photographed cuddling with little " @entity126 , " but he 's also sent her several designer duds , including an itsy - bitsy custom @entity130 tee			2
let 's hope the infant 's get - ups receive better feedback than the much - maligned floral frock mama @entity117 wore to the @entity136 while heavily pregnant			2
@entity137 & @entity138 : prints , please though her favorite print right now has to be the @entity142 monogram , actress / campaign star @entity137 has always been fond of patterned pieces			0
it 's not unusual to see her and eight - year - old @entity5 in mommy - and - me @entity146 stripes , geometric graphic prints , or girly floral dresses			2

@entity0 : 7 editor styling tricks guaranteed to make you look thinner @entity152 & @entity153 : @entity154 cool besides being a dead - ringer for her mother , @entity152 , @entity155 has adopted her mom 's casual , preppy - with - a - touch - of boho style			1
shorts are a constant for both her and @entity162 , as are denim jackets , skinny jeans , hoodies , and sundresses			0
and is just us , or is it getting really hard to tell these two apart ? @entity169 & @entity170 : @entity171 grounded with flats there are many , many reasons to admire @entity169 , but chief among them is her non-conforming decision to skip the stilettos and wear flats on the red carpet			0
it seems her six - year - old daughter , @entity182 , has been taking notes			0
like her mom , the grade - schooler favors a chic bob and clean , @entity188 - chic basics paired with ballet flats and sandals			2
@entity0 : how to find the perfect berry lipstick @entity192 & @entity192 : pink ? puh - lease kudos to @entity192 for resisting the urge to deck out her little girl in head - to - toe pink			0
instead , the precious two - year - old favors gender - neutral hues like gray and camel , with a splash of yellow and baby blue thrown in			0
" she definitely has a point of view , " @entity192 's mother says			2
