, @entity2 and @entity3 played overgrown arrested - development cases who won us over from their very first whopping lie onward			1
at the time , the two actors were already in their mid- 30s , but they were still able to mount a bad - boy generational assault against all things civil and decent			2
" @entity12 " reunites @entity2 , with his smarm - that - looks - like - sweetness ( or is it the other way around ? ) , and @entity3 , with his disaffected fast patter			1
the audience is still rooting for them — only this time the two are playing the older , stodgy guys			2
they 're @entity19 ( @entity2 ) and @entity20 ( @entity3 ) , designer - watch salesman who lose their careers in what seems like the tick of a second hand			1
tossed into a dead - end job market , without any real prospects , they talk their way into an internship on the sprawling , buzzy @entity34 campus of @entity35 , where they 're pitted against a bunch of brainiac 20 - year - olds who live and breathe technology and do n't get any of the pair 's pathetically ancient pop - culture references ( @entity43 17 , anyone ? )			1
directed by the workmanlike @entity46 ( who made the @entity48 films and @entity49 ) , the movie is a halfway clever cookie - cutter culture - clash comedy , but there 's a reason that it lacks the highs of " wedding crashers : " the @entity55 puts us on the side of those who are trying to hold on to respectability , not tear it down			2
the movie was made with the cooperation of @entity35 , which is why its basic attitude toward the search engine that changed the world is one of unironic reverence			1
true , the place can come off looking a bit goofy and obsessive			2
the leader of the internship program is mr. @entity72 ( @entity74 's @entity73 ) , a po - faced corporate guru who lights up whenever he extols the virtues of ethereal concepts like '' @entity77			0
'' and when the army of interns gets divvied up into a dozen competing teams , only one of which will ultimately land jobs there , @entity19 and @entity85 are stuck with the social outliers that no one else wants — the geeks among geeks			0
they 're led by @entity90 ( @entity91 ) , a shrimpy , horn - rimmed genius who tries to fit in by saying things like '' fo shizzle			0
'' ( he 's clearly been saying that since he was about five			0
) the actors cast as @entity35 interns are likable and mildly amusing in a " @entity98 " 2013 way			1
but i wish that at least one of them had been given a major voice , a way of making the tech banter seem hilariously cool			0
the likeliest candidate would have been @entity107 ( @entity108 ) , with his sullen stare and open contempt for our heroes , but the character loses his superior edge over time , which is the movie 's mistake			0
it 's up to @entity19 and @entity85 to teach these brilliant losers how to live , and what that comes down to is showing them that it 's fun to let go and do @entity122 shots and dance like crazy and hit on people			0
how rebellious ! the internship was written by @entity3 and @entity126 , and it 's got little jabs of wit , like the scene in which @entity19 and @entity85 are duped into addressing a bald instructor in a wheelchair as '' professor @entity132 '' ( he is not pleased )			1
a lot of the film is devoted to showing how the cult of technology and the human element do n't need to be opposed ; they can , and should , work hand in hand			0
that 's a nice message ( and it 's certainly a swell advertisement for @entity35 ) , but it 's not a funny message			1
" @entity12 " gets so caught up in healing the generational divide that it 's ostensibly about — the analog dudes vs. the digital kids — that the movie ends up being just a pleasant collection of mild laughs			1
it needed more spin , more @entity152			0

@entity2 and @entity3 last teamed up in " @entity1 "
" @entity12 " finds them vying for spots at @entity35
*critic* calls it a " pleasant collection of mild laughs "
