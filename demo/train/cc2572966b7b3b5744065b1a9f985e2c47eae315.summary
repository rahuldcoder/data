-- you would n't necessarily expect a blockbuster exhibition on women 's clothing to open with a giant image of a naked lady			1
but step inside @entity9 's @entity8 and you 'll find @entity11 in all her unclothed glory , hand clasped around an apple before the first bite that sends the rest of us grasping for cover			0
we 've been dressing ourselves ever since , say the curators of " women @entity21 , " a show chronicling how women have used clothing to empower themselves -- from @entity27 's criminally short tunics , to @entity29 ' eye - gouging shoulder pads in @entity30			1
" this is n't an exhibition about fashion , despite the fact that we use ' fashion ' in the title , " said co-curator @entity31 , rather cryptically , at the opening			2
" it 's about clothes and how women have used them to empower themselves , to intimidate people , and to make them feel sexy			1
" @entity43 beyond @entity11 's naked form and you 'll find the black sequined dress given to princess @entity47 on her 36th birthday , and a baby - blue two - piece worn by former @entity51 prime minister @entity50 after becoming leader of her party			1
indeed , what really brings this exhibition to life is not simply the lovingly preserved garments -- but imagining influential women wearing them in a very different world			1
" we wanted to look at how fashion mirrors what 's going on in society , " explained co-curator @entity60			0
" as women 's roles changed over decades , so did what they wore			2
" among the vast collection of painfully rigid 19th century corsets , battered broad - brimmed hats worn by the @entity72 , and towering @entity74 stilettos , are the personally selected outfits of 26 modern - day movers and shakers			2
the simple trousers , jacket , silk blouse , and red and white striped scarf owned by mayor of @entity85 @entity84 may not immediately appear eye - catching -- but it has a special emotional pull			1
" this scarf is my lucky charm , it 's the one i wore on the evening i won the election for @entity83 " explained @entity84 , the first woman to have job , and one who cites former @entity95 secretary of state @entity96 as a role model			0
" how one dresses is very important , " she said at the official exhibition opening , herself clad in a sleek black leather jacket			2
" the garment is the presentation of ourselves to others			0
it 's a world in which we have some authority			0
and by definition , women are considered as not having authority , as being powerless			0
" among the faceless mannequins draped in clothes usually worn by some of the most influential women in the world , is a sweeping white satin @entity117 cape owned by celebrity architect @entity119			1
the @entity121 - born @entity51 architect also designed the exhibition , creating a maze of mirrors and lime green perspex signs that guide visitors through the decades			0
" she behaved in exactly the way one wants @entity119 to behave -- we never saw her , " said co-curator and fashion journalist @entity31 with a wry smile			1
" we worked with her , and got missives passed backwards and forwards , but it was an @entity135 performance , " he adds , perhaps in reference to the architect 's work on both the 2012 @entity9 and upcoming 2020 @entity139			0
one thing 's for sure -- this is an exhibition dressed to impress			0
opinion : @entity119 -- ' in @entity121 , @entity142 was like sketching ' timeline : the evolution of @entity146 's fashion empire insight : meet the new generation of ' modelpreneurs '			2
