-- for most of his life , @entity1 was shy			1
he was the kind who would stand in the corner at a party swaying side - to - side , quietly sipping on a beer while others danced and socialized			0
" we called him @entity11 , " @entity1 's cousin , @entity12 , said			1
" @entity11 was a great cousin with a smile that could light up an entire room			2
he was not the person with the most words , but he had a great sense of humor and personality			0
" @entity0 first learned about @entity1 when his name was added to the @entity24 database , an interactive memorial for the troops who have lost their lives fighting in the @entity29 and @entity30 wars			1
thanks to @entity33 , we were given an opportunity to learn more			1
@entity1 was nicknamed @entity11 after a character in a reggae song who was known for being outgoing and was quite the ladies man , someone who @entity1 was not			1
@entity33 , a native of @entity40 , @entity41 , explained that it is common in @entity41 culture to give someone a nickname that is opposite of who they really are			1
" if someone 's big , we call them smally			0
if they 're tall , we call them shorty , " @entity33 said			1
" it was kind of a play on him not being that outgoing and him being a real introvert			0
" @entity1 was born in @entity41 and adopted at nine by @entity59 and @entity60 and a few years later , he moved to @entity61 with his adopted father			1
around 14 , his cousins in @entity64 , who he would visit often , dubbed him @entity11			0
he often introduced himself to others using the obverse nickname			0
" he loved it , " @entity33 said			1
" everybody called him @entity11 , and he got a big kick out of it			0
" @entity1 might have been quiet , but according to @entity33 , when he did talk , he always had something interesting to say			1
" some people , they do n't need to say anything and they just have that way about them , " @entity33 said			1
" everyone listened when he said something because he rarely spoke			0
( @entity1 was ) just very on point with the words that came out of his mouth			2
" but when @entity1 enlisted with the @entity81 in 1999 , @entity33 saw a big change in his cousin 's personality			1
he started to break out of his shell and became more confident in himself , something his cousin wants people to remember			2
" i want people to remember him giving it all but also remember how the service made him better , " @entity33 said			2
" i saw how great @entity1 had become as an individual			2
he still had his introvert self , but he was just way more confident , way more powerful as a person			0
it was great to see that , and i know it was the @entity81 that brought that out of him			2
i do n't think there is anywhere else that could have done that to him like the service did			0
" when @entity1 enlisted , pre-september 11 , 2001 , it never crossed his cousin 's mind that one day he might see combat			1
" the most war you 'd hear going on is between @entity111 and @entity112 and they just passed away , " @entity33 said			2
" you never thought about any global war going on			0
that was in the back of our minds			0
" even when @entity1 was deployed to @entity29 in march of 2003 , @entity33 never thought that @entity11 might not return			1
but when his uncle told him on november 13 , 2003 , that @entity1 had been killed by a roadside bomb two days prior , on @entity122 , his whole life changed			1
" in your 20s , you do n't think that someone is going to pass away			0
you just do n't think that someone is going to be 25 and not be here anymore , " @entity33 said			2
" it was kind of hard to believe			0
" at the time of @entity1 's death , @entity33 was in college studying computer science			1
he had known since he was in the sixth grade that he wanted to be a software engineer , but he did not know in what capacity until his younger brother started working in the defense industry and cousin @entity1 enlisted in the @entity81			1
" it was an encouragement to me to do something that i thought was more meaningful , " @entity33 said			2
" what @entity1 did , what soldiers do , that makes a difference			2
that 's shaping the world			0
that 's shaping the future			0
" @entity33 started working for the defense industry in 2005 as a software engineer , and one of his first projects involved outfitting @entity155 military humvees with armor that could help protect troops from rocket - propelled grenades and improvised explosive devices , something that @entity33 believes could have possibly saved his cousin			1
@entity33 is still with the defense industry , working side - by - side with service members from @entity164			1
he knows that what he and his fellow engineers do makes a difference , and he loves that they are all working towards the same goal : helping the brave men and women serving in the armed forces			0
" i think ( @entity1 ) would have been proud of the accomplishments that my brother and i have made , " @entity33 said			1
" i am just kind of disappointed that he 's not here to share in some of this			0
" but to this day , @entity33 ca n't say he has bad feelings about his cousin going to war			1
" he did an admirable thing			0
he did something that i think is one of the highest callings you can have in life -- to serve other people			0
he did that with zeal and gusto , and no one had to pull him dragging to do it			0
he did it because he wanted to do it , and he knew it was something that would make him better			0
