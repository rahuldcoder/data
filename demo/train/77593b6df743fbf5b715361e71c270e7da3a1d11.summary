-- holiday tv marathons have become almost as great a tradition as @entity4 fireworks			1
wednesday 's best bet : @entity7 's " @entity8 " marathon			1

also at the top of our list : two tributes to the late @entity21			1
@entity22 marathons " the @entity25 " from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. et , while the @entity23 , not to be outdone , airs " @entity24 " from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. et the following morning			1
