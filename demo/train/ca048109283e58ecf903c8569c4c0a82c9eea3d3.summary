@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a valley in the misty hills of @entity0 sits @entity1 's largest refugee camp -- a maze of mud alleyways stuffed with bamboo and wood huts			1
the camp is filled with people who fled @entity12 before the country 's regime signaled its intent to come in from the diplomatic cold			1
for the majority of the 30,000 people living there , the camp is their entire world			1
their daily routine changes little because they ca n't go into the rest of @entity1 or they will be arrested , and they wo n't go back to @entity12 because they are still afraid or have nothing to go back to			1
but on this day there was something exciting happening inside the camp , something that has never happened before			1
hundreds of people streamed onto a football field inside the camp to see a woman many consider a hero			2
they were waving the @entity12 flag and chanting : " @entity39 , @entity39 , " which in @entity40 means mother @entity39			1
@entity42 cautions against ' reckless optimism ' mother @entity39 is how they refer to @entity42 -- a hero to many in the camp			1
@entity42 fought for democracy in @entity12 for decades , spending 15 years under house arrest because of it , before being elected to parliament -- though the military regime that has ruled @entity12 for decades still holds a great deal of power			1
she ended her first international trip since being released from house arrest by visiting the camp in western @entity1 to see her people			1
" today we are very happy you know			2
our people , we like to see our leader , " one spectator said			2
another chimed in : " we need democracy , so we need our lady			2
we trust her so much			2
we could n't see her in @entity12 ( @entity12 's former name ) because she was always in her house			1
so we come here and now we see her			2
" @entity12 migrants dream of return home bouquets of flowers were thrown at her while she waved from her car			1
she even grabbed a sign that someone had hand written in her honor			0
unfortunately the pro-democracy leader was n't able to make any rousing speeches because her actions in the camp were restricted by @entity83			1
no megaphones were to be used , so even when she did try to speak to the cheering crowd while holding on to the open door of her suv , she was drowned out by the sheer number of well - wishers			0
but not everyone in the camp decided to go			2
there were plenty of people going about their daily routine			0
for them @entity42 is a name they recognize but a person they know little about			1
" i do n't care because i am busy with my work , " @entity102 said			0
then she held up the thing that was on her mind : a small plastic bag of live frogs			0
that was the family lunch and she was on her way to prepare the feast at the same time @entity42 was due to arrive at the camp			1
deeper into the bamboo maze , 34 - year - old @entity113 is sitting outside his hut			0
he is n't going either			0
" i only know her name but do n't know who she is			0
i have never seen her , " he said			0
he recalled his journey over the border at the age of nine			0
" i could n't live there			0
they were destroying things ; they came and took our houses			0
we had to come here to live , " he said			0
@entity113 could n't escape misfortune for long			0
at 18 , while gathering wood at the @entity12 - @entity1 border , he stepped on a mine and lost a leg			1
but today daily life in the camp with his family , including his two children , is keeps him occupied			2
with @entity42 now a member of @entity140 and @entity12 moving towards democracy , should the refugees start considering going back ? @entity42 herself warned against expecting things to change quickly in her country			1
the refugees are doing just that			0
not one said they would go back			0
those who remember their homeland said it would be good to go home , but first they needed guarantees that they had something to go back to , plus they simply did n't trust the government -- not yet anyway			0
" there is nothing left for me there , " @entity113 said			0
and then there is a large section of the refugee community that has never known @entity12			1
the camp is their home because they were born and raised there .			2

@entity42 rounds of *historic* @entity1 trip with visit to largest refugee camp in the country
many of the 30,000 *inhabitants* fled *persecution* from @entity12 's military regime
some wish to return to @entity12 , but prefer to wait for *reforms* in @entity12 to continue
pro-democracy leader @entity42 recently elected to @entity12 's parliament
