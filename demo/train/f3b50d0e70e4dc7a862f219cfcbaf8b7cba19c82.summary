-- @entity1 may be coming out with its own smartphone , according to a new report from @entity4			1
the company reportedly is working with @entity6 to develop the hardware , which will likely run @entity1 's version of the @entity10 operating system			1
a phone is n't as far - fetched of an undertaking as it might seem for the company , which has never made a handset			0
@entity1 already has many of the building blocks it would need to make money off a smartphone , including its own version of the @entity10 operating system , an established app store and well - stocked content marketplaces that could make up a good chunk of revenue for the phone			1
it also has a pool of loyal customers who trust the brand			0
@entity1 is relatively new to the hardware game			1
the company 's first entry was the @entity32 e-reader released in 2007 , followed by its @entity10 - powered big brother , the @entity35 tablet			1
@entity1 has had more success than many other companies in the tablet market thanks to getting in early and a low price made possible by revenue from books , movies and music			1
however , the smartphone market is already filled with well - established competitors			2
current market leader @entity46 shipped 42.2 million smartphones worldwide in the first quarter of 2012 , according to research firm @entity49			0
@entity50 was a close second with 35.1 million smartphones , followed at a distance by @entity54 and @entity55			0
there are also some challenges unique to selling smartphones			0
to build a decent device , @entity1 will need the right patents so it does n't end up on the receiving end of costly lawsuits			2
to that end , the company just hired a new general manager for patent acquisitions and investments , @entity68			0
dealing with carriers would be another hurdle			0
@entity71 at @entity72 floated an intriguing theory : @entity1 could buy wireless service wholesale from the big carriers and bundle it with the devices , like it does for the @entity32			2
the rumor that @entity1 would unveil a smartphone late this year surfaced in november 2011 , when @entity80 's research department predicted the device based on its supply chain checks in @entity83			1
the new report , based on two anonymous sources " with knowledge of the matter " supports the original theory floated by @entity80 .			0
