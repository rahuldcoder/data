a " massive and unprecedented " assault against @entity4 fighters in @entity5 appears to be targeting high - level operatives of the terrorist network , @entity1 analysts said monday			1
it was n't clear who those targets are , but @entity5 's government says it has killed dozens of members of @entity13 in a joint operation with the @entity1			1
the ongoing push included a sunday night ambush in which @entity5 special forces killed men believed to be top leaders of the group , a high - level @entity5 government official being briefed on the strikes told @entity23 on monday			1
the @entity5 collected the bodies and will perform dna testing to determine the militants ' identities , the official said			2
in addition , suspected @entity1 drone strikes over the weekend pounded a mountain camp where @entity4 fighters were training for attacks " against @entity5 and foreign interests , " @entity5 's @entity29 said			1
@entity1 authorities blame the @entity5 - based branch of @entity4 for a string of plots against @entity1 , including the failed attempt to blow up a @entity1 - bound jetliner with a bomb concealed in an operative 's underwear in 2009			2
@entity23 national security analyst @entity44 said the intensity of the strikes suggests there 's a " very real " hope of capturing or killing a top @entity4 figure			0
" the fact that this is an ongoing effort with such massive resources behind it tells you that the target is a very high - value target , " @entity44 said			2
" you do n't commit the @entity5 army , you do n't commit the drones without the target being very real			0
" by monday night , at least 65 militants have been killed , some of them from neighboring @entity61 , @entity5 officials said			1
another three civilians were killed in a saturday night drone strike , the high - level @entity5 official said earlier			1
' massive and unprecedented ' the official called the raids " massive and unprecedented			0
" one of the sites targeted is in the same area where scores of @entity4 followers had gathered recently to hear from @entity73 , the head of the terrorist network 's @entity5 branch and the global organization 's " crown prince , " the official said			0
in addition to the " undiebomber " plot on christmas day 2009 , @entity1 officials have said @entity13 was behind a 2010 plan to load bombs onto cargo planes disguised as computer printers , another plot to blow up a jetliner in 2012 and a 2013 scheme to attack oil and gas ports in @entity5			1

@entity94 is one of the main reasons @entity13 has become " a direct threat " to the @entity1 , @entity44 said			0
speculation swirled monday that he was among the targets of the weekend 's attacks , but @entity5 officials have so far identified only three men they said were midlevel leaders of the group			1
previous @entity1 strikes have killed radical @entity5 - @entity1 cleric @entity104 and @entity105 , an @entity4 operative wanted in the bombing of the destroyer @entity109 in 2000			2
the high - level @entity5 government official would not confirm whether drones were used in the weekend attacks , but the @entity1 is the only country known to have conducted drone strikes in @entity5			1
as a rule , @entity1 officials do n't comment on those strikes , and @entity116 had little to say about the operation monday			2

" growing frustration in @entity5 the high - level @entity5 official said it would take time to clarify the details of sunday 's strikes : whether the raids targeted camps , vehicles on the move or both , the full death toll among the militants and whether there were any civilian casualties			1
but other @entity5 officials , who asked to remain anonymous as they are not authorized to speak to the media , said there was growing frustration within the government about the lack of clarity and expressed concern that some of the information the military is reporting may be propaganda			1
" i 'm worried this is an attempt to convince @entity5 that the @entity1 and @entity5 have turned a corner and are in the process of destroying @entity13 , " one of those other officials said			2
" at this hour , the numbers of militants being reported as being killed keeps changing , and we still are n't sure if any civilians have been killed or wounded in these strikes			0
" he added , " @entity5 are smart enough to doubt initial reports of this type			0
if this does turn out to be exaggeration , it will make the people here trust their government even less than they do and fuel growing anger over the drone program			0
" the @entity1 first used armed drones to pick off an @entity4 operative in @entity5 in 2002			0
strikes on suspected @entity4 figures resumed in 2009 , with more than 92 drone attacks since then , as well as a further 15 @entity1 strikes using other forms of weaponry such as cruise missiles , according to a count by the @entity189 , a @entity1 - based think tank that tracks the raids			2
