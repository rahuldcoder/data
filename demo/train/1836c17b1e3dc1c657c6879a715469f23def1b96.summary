@entity0 , @entity1 -- senior @entity1 dissident cleric grand ayatollah @entity3 died overnight , several state - run @entity1 news agencies reported sunday			1
his son , @entity6 , told the official @entity8 news agency that his 87 - year - old father passed away due to cardiac arrest at 1:30 a.m. on sunday morning , @entity5 reported			0
the semi-official @entity12 agency said he died at his home in the @entity1 holy city of @entity15			1
@entity3 -- a key figure in @entity1 's @entity17 30 years ago -- was perhaps the most prominent cleric who publicly criticized the presidential elections last june that returned hard - liner @entity19 to the presidency			1
on his web site , @entity3 described the street protests that followed the polling as a challenge to the " very legitimacy of the @entity26			1
" his death is " a terrible blow for the ( reformist ) green movement and everybody who has been active these past few months , " said @entity32 , a senior research consultant at the @entity33 for @entity35 and @entity1 studies in @entity36			1
in the last six months , @entity3 had become the voice of the green movement on key foreign policy issues , @entity32 said			2
the cleric was able to comment more freely than reformist presidential candidates			2
" he was a very senior grand ayatollah with very good revolutionary credentials , and a very vocal critic of the ruling establishment , " @entity32 said			1
" he was a major thorn in the back of ( @entity1 supreme leader @entity48			2
he was a bastion for all the people opposing the excesses of the system , " even within the ruling establishment , he said			0
@entity3 , for example , took a public stand against nuclear weapons in october , issuing a fatwa , or religious edict , declaring them to be " un-islamic " and instructing @entity60 to take the lead in banning them , said @entity62 , diplomatic editor of the weekly newspaper @entity64 in @entity36			2
@entity1 's nuclear program has been the subject of intense international concern , with the @entity68 considering expanding sanctions against the @entity71 state despite its insistence it does not intend to build a bomb			1
@entity3 's upcoming funeral must be a cause for concern for the authorities in @entity0 , @entity62 said , but because of his standing , they can not ban it			1
" already there are people starting to march towards his home , " she said she had heard from sources inside @entity1			2
" he has a very large public following especially since the june elections and all his statements in favor of human rights			2
" it is not clear whether his death sparked demonstrations , as some reports said			0
@entity2 producer @entity94 saw no unusual activity in the vicinity of @entity97 , at @entity98 or @entity99 in @entity0 on sunday			2
@entity3 's web site called for a funeral procession from his home to the @entity103 in @entity15 , the holy city where he lived , starting at 9 a.m. on monday ( 12:30 a.m. et )			1
any demonstrations resulting from the burial could spill over into the capital , @entity62 said			0
" @entity15 is very close to @entity0 and this is a major event , " she said , adding that it is difficult to predict what would happen			2
" it would be questionable how a lot of the foot soldiers of the revolution would react			0
" the timing of his death could also be significant , she said , since it comes in the month that first saw the demonstrations that spiraled into the revolution that toppled the monarchy and brought the @entity71 regime to power			1
@entity3 was once a confidant of @entity124 , who led @entity1 for a decade after the revolution			1
he studied under @entity124 and then acted as his representative in @entity1 after @entity124 was exiled by the shah for criticizing the monarchy , @entity62 said			1
@entity3 , too , was jailed and exiled			2
after the revolution , he was the heir apparent to @entity124 , and played a key role in writing @entity1 's constitution as the first chair of the powerful @entity133			1
he was also the leader of friday prayers in @entity0 , one of the most public and influential pulpits in the country			0
but he was supplanted by the current supreme leader , ayatollah @entity138 , and was placed under several years of house arrest in 1997			0
" his problems with @entity124 started in the summer of 1988 when they started executing ... thousands of leftist prisoners , " @entity62 said			0
" he never was in agreement with that , and then he started to fade " from power			0
" once @entity48 became leader , @entity3 objected , " she said			0
@entity3 said @entity48 " was elevated above his ( religious ) qualifications , " pointing out that he had not earned the title of ayatollah			1
" it was then he was arrested			0
" recently he has objected to the current regime 's characterization of his one - time mentor khomeini as a saint , she added			0
and following the disputed elections in june , " he issued a ground - breaking fatwa articulating the policies of the ( reformist ) green movement to the world			0
" given the dynamics of the political situation in @entity1 , the regime will have difficulty controlling his funeral and where it might lead , " she said			1
@entity3 had been equally critical of the parliamentary electoral process in 2004 , arguing in favor of reformist candidates			0
sitting behind his desk with a government minder in the room , he said then that @entity1 's @entity71 revolution had lost its way			1
" even i , who used to be a leading figure in the revolution , have not the right to speak out , " he said			0
" @entity180 will never last long			0
the gentlemen in power must submit to the wishes of the people , or they will be swept away			0
