-- in need of a spring fling ? two new but very different video game releases this week should help			0
shown for the first time back in 2005 , @entity7 ' oft - delayed " @entity6 " has finally been released			1
this supernatural adventure is worth the wait , though , and offers plenty of action , atmosphere and creative story - telling			1
" @entity20 , " on the other hand , challenges you to pull off slick tricks , take on team - based challenges and run your own skateboarding business			1
" @entity20 " is arguably the best in the series yet , though it 's more evolutionary than revolutionary			1
here 's a closer look			0
" @entity6 " 3 1/2 stars out of 4 ( @entity27 ; rated teen ; $ 59.99 ; alanwake.com ) " @entity6 " is a strange single - player adventure about a bestselling author in the middle of a dry spell			1
to overcome his writer 's block , @entity37 's wife , @entity36 , brings him to a small northwestern town called @entity39 , but @entity36 soon disappears			0
after awakening from a blackout , @entity40 discovers an account of what happened that he ca n't remember writing -- until he starts finding sheets strewn throughout the town that fill in some blanks but foreshadow impending danger			0
in this game played from a third - person perspective , @entity40 talks with many residents to gather clues , explores this once - idyllic town and battles supernatural foes ( collectively called " @entity58 " ) using light as a common element in all the weapons and tools to help ward off what lurks in the darkness			2
there is some puzzle - solving , too , but most of the game focuses on character interaction , exploration and combat			2
gamers who prefer story - driven adventures , such as @entity76 's " @entity75 " or @entity78 's " @entity77 " should appreciate " @entity6 " as an interactive suspense novel with supernatural undertones			1
" @entity20 " 3 stars out of 4 ( @entity82 ; @entity27 ; rated teen ; $ 59.99 ; skate.ea.com ) it 's only been a year since @entity78 rolled out " skate 2 , " a game that proved the publisher was serious about competing against @entity89 's " @entity90 " series			2
" @entity20 " improves on 2009 's offering with a new city , extra tricks and deeper online play , but it 's not radically different than its predecessor			1
therefore , those who own " skate 2 " might want to test out the new game first to decide whether it 's worth the $ 60 price tag			0
" @entity20 " focuses heavily on cooperative play , including team - based challenges in the fictitious city of @entity107			1
the goal of the meaty career mode is to start your own business and become the hottest skateboarding brand around			0
your online buddies can join your crew to help take on various challenges , which include amassing a high score by pulling off midair tricks , achieving the longest jump , racing against others or taking part in photo shoots			2
also , back again is the fun @entity123 mode that rewards you for over-the - top spills			0
if you need more people for team - based events , and your friends are n't online , computer - controlled skaters can fill in			2
improved " @entity131 " controls place a heavy emphasis on the controller 's dual analog sticks ( to control your skater and board ) and trigger buttons ( for grabs and grinds )			0
the new park creator is easier to use compared with last year 's tool , and again allows you to create the ultimate skate park from scratch .			0

" @entity20 " is arguably the best in the series with extra tricks and deeper online play
" @entity6 " is a strange single - player adventure about a bestselling author
gamers who prefer story - driven adventures will appreciate it as an interactive suspense novel
