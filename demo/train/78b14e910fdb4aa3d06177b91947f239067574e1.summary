@entity0 -- newly released documents show that military personnel watching over at least two @entity5 citizens held in @entity7 brigs feared that the isolation and austere conditions were threatening detainees ' sanity			1
records show that military personnel feared for the sanity of detainees in @entity7 brigs			1
documents obtained through a @entity18 request quote an unnamed brig official writing about detainee @entity20 in june 2002			1
" i will continue to do what i can to help this individual maintain his sanity , but in my opinion , we 're working with borrowed time , " he wrote			1
the recipient of the e-mail also is unidentified			0
the communication is one of several in which brig personnel expressed worries to superiors about the mental state of @entity20 , a dual @entity37 / @entity5 citizen who was captured on the battlefield in @entity39 in 2001			1
another e-mail about @entity20 written six months later , in december 2002 , shows an unidentified military person appealing to higher - ups to be able to provide @entity20 with games and tapes to help him pass the time during confinement as a means to steady his mental state			1
" i would like to have some form of an incentive program in place to reward him for his continued good behavior , but more so , to keep him from whacking [ sic ] out on me			1
" a june 2003 e-mail reports that @entity20 " feels as if he has been forgotten			1
" " the last thing i wanted to have happen was to send him anywhere from here as a ' @entity62 , ' of use to no one , " the author of the message wrote			0
" i fear the rubber band is nearing its breaking point here and not totally confident i can keep his head in the game much longer			0
" the @entity71 would not discuss the specifics of the newly released documents			1
but a spokesman , @entity74			0
@entity75 , issued a brief statement : " the @entity71 policy is clear : we treat all detainees humanely			1
the @entity5 operates safe , humane and professional detention operations for unlawful enemy combatants at war with this country			0
" after his capture in 2001 , @entity20 was sent to the detention facility at @entity86 , @entity87			1
once officials discovered that he was born in the @entity5 , he was transferred to the @entity5 and held in solitary confinement in @entity91 brigs in @entity92 , @entity93 , and then in @entity94 , @entity95			0
@entity20 was never charged with breaking any laws , and the @entity97 ruled in 2004 that the @entity5 could not hold him indefinitely without bringing charges			1
@entity20 was allowed to return to @entity37 , and he relinquished his @entity5 citizenship			1
the e-mails reveal that brig personnel had been instructed to treat @entity20 and later two other enemy combatants held in the @entity5 in a manner similar to hundreds of prisoners detained by the military at @entity86 , @entity87			1
attorneys for a second detainee , @entity107 , filed a @entity18 request to obtain the documents about the treatment of the detainees at the military brigs			1
@entity114 's @entity113 and the @entity115 obtained the 91 pages of material , which the @entity115 released to the public			2
@entity119 , one of the @entity121 attorneys , said the government 's own documents provide damaging information about how his client and the other enemy combatants were treated in @entity5 facilities			1
" he was treated abysmally and unconstitutionally for years , " he said			2
" it 's a clear violation of the @entity130 , " which guarantees the right to due process			2
another @entity121 lawyer , @entity134 , said the documents show that military staff at the brig were told to keep @entity121 and the others " in conditions to soften them up for interrogation			2
" the lawyers are concerned that they have yet to receive documents about @entity121 's treatment from 2002 to 2004 , which they contend could provide more evidence about how he was treated			1
most of the material just released concerns @entity20			1
the @entity115 issued a statement saying brig officials " doubted the wisdom of applying @entity86 rules on @entity5 soil " but had to follow orders from the @entity71			1
the @entity5 eventually brought charges against @entity121 , and he was convicted in 2007 of providing material support for terrorism in @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162			0
a third detainee remains in custody at the brig in @entity94 , @entity95			2
@entity166 is a native of @entity167 and was a legal @entity5 resident when he was arrested in @entity169 in 2001			0
@entity170 was transferred from civilian to military custody in 2003			2
@entity5 officials suspected that @entity166 was a member of an @entity175 sleeper cell , but no terrorism charges were filed against him			0
@entity177 , a lawyer for @entity166 , is appealing his client 's detention to the @entity97			2
@entity177 also works for the @entity115			0
when @entity1 asked for his reaction to the e-mails , @entity177 replied , " i was surprised you saw the concern and discomfort so early on by military officials " at the brigs			2
@entity177 said those at the brig seemed sympathetic to the plight of the enemy combatants in their care but were forced to follow orders			0
the new documents also contain e-mails about his client			0
one from april 2007 talks about how @entity166 had not been able to communicate with his wife and five children , who had gone back to @entity37 to live			0
" i believe that it is in mr. @entity166 's and our best interest for him to be able to communicate in some way with his family , " said the unidentified brig official			2
" five years is too long			0
" @entity177 said that conditions began to improve a bit for his client after he filed suit in 2005 but that he still does n't have contact with other detainees at the brig			2
" the fundamental problem remains : he 's in virtual isolation			0
more than 1,800 days in isolation			0
" " his mental state has been deteriorating , " @entity177 said			0
" you 're alone with no idea when confinement will end			0
" @entity177 said @entity166 is now allowed two phone calls a year with his family			0
he can get mail , but the lawyer said it takes two to four months to get to his client , because everything is sent first to the military facility in @entity86 , where it must be cleared .			0
