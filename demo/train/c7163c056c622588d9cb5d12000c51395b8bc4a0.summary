-- after @entity3 's shock victory over top - ranked @entity4 on saturday , rugby fans were delighting in the prospect that the two nations might be drawn together for the @entity7			1
however , such a meeting will not happen before the knockout stages of the tournament after hosts @entity3 came out of the hat with @entity13 and @entity15 champions @entity14 and two qualifiers in @entity17 on monday			1
the @entity4 , who won the @entity7 on home soil last year for the first time since its inaugural staging in 1987 , will line up against @entity22 , @entity23 and a qualifier from @entity25 and @entity26 in @entity27 the @entity28 were top of the four seeds along with @entity26 , @entity13 and last year 's runners - up @entity30			1
the @entity32 will take on @entity33 , @entity34 and qualifiers from @entity25 and the @entity36 in @entity37 while the @entity26 -- champions in 2007 -- will play @entity38 , @entity39 and teams from the @entity41 and @entity36 playoffs			1
@entity3 unexpectedly halted @entity4 's 20 - match unbeaten run with a 38 - 21 win at @entity46 , having lost narrowly to @entity26 and @entity13 in the traditional end - of - season tour matches by southern hemisphere sides			1
following that upset result , 2003 @entity7 - winning coach @entity49 said his country would be the team that all others hoped to avoid at monday 's draw in @entity55			1
present coach @entity56 hopes his young @entity3 team can continue to develop and peak in time to survive in the toughest group of the @entity7 -- only two teams go through from each pool			1
it will be the first time that @entity3 and @entity14 have met in the group stage			2
" it is definitely a pretty tough pool			0
to win the @entity7 you have to win big games and i have got a huge amount of respect for what @entity14 have done recently , " @entity56 told the @entity68 @entity67 website			2
" we know their squad pretty well , it is a young side and a lot of them will still be around in 2015			0
@entity13 have just beaten us and if you look at the age and profile of their squad , they have got some young lads as well			0
we will look forward to it			0
" @entity56 took over the coaching role from @entity87 , who was unable to emulate his 2003 @entity7 success as a player when the @entity3 team traveled down under last year			2
hampered by off - field controversies , the @entity68 failed to reach the semifinals for the first time since 1999 , when they were hosts			0
" twelve months ago i went out to @entity4 for two weeks and got a little sample of what it is like and the impact on that country , " @entity56 said			0
" we have seen what the @entity99 did for our country and the next big sporting event is the @entity7			0
by that time everybody is going to be revved up and it 's going to be a big party			0
" meanwhile , @entity4 's @entity106 has been named as the @entity108 's world player of the year for the second time			0
the fly - half has bounced back from the disappointment of missing most of the @entity112 due to injury by inspiring the @entity4 to a perfect record of six wins in the inaugural @entity116 -- which featured the @entity118 teams plus @entity22 -- and victory in the @entity121 series against @entity13 for the 10th year in a row			1
the 30 - year - old extended his world record points - scoring tally to 1,385 from 94 tests despite a below - par performance against @entity3			2
@entity106 headed off his captain @entity127 , a three - time winner , @entity3 's @entity129 -- who scored 17 points on saturday -- and @entity30 fly - half @entity131			1
all @entity4 coach @entity133 followed his predecessor @entity134 by keeping that award in @entity4 's ownership , while the @entity28 were also named best team for the third year in a row .			0
