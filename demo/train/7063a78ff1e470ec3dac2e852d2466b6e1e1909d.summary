-- a directive recently handed down by a @entity3 - area suburban mayor has ignited the latest round of a seemingly endless debate -- one that always burns with more intensity in the home of the @entity9 than anywhere else			1
many residents in the @entity3 , @entity12 area are auto workers			1
thousands have been laid off recently			0
it 's the debate that relates to cars and goes something like this : " @entity18 ! " vs. " i 'll buy what i want ! " that debate sometimes , but not always , begins as a civil conversation			1
but the @entity3 area has been hit hard in the last five years by the ongoing , sometimes enormous financial losses posted by the @entity9			1
the @entity9 's financial woes have had a direct impact on the @entity28 economy with hundreds of thousands of layoffs and / or buyouts			1
given that so many of the state 's workers have lost their jobs -- and in some cases , their homes - it sometimes does n't take long before the car debate escalates into an emotional one			2
that can lead to angry name - calling and insults - like many of the reader comments that flooded the online edition of the @entity3 newspaper that first reported a controversial story			2
@entity47 autos : best new car deals this month this latest round of the discussion was inspired by a decision made by @entity52 , the mayor of @entity54 , @entity28 , a large @entity3 suburb and @entity28 's third - largest city , and where a good portion of the residents are ( or were ) autoworkers			1
in mid-august , @entity52 told his department heads , which amount to 40 or 50 of the city 's more than 700 employees that he " expects " the next car they buy will be an @entity18 model			1
more to the point , he expects them to drive @entity69 or @entity71 vehicles , since both companies have various manufacturing or assembly plants in @entity54 -- not to mention @entity69 's sprawling @entity75 -- and therefore are the city 's two highest taxpayers			2
@entity52 , who drives a 2001 @entity78 himself , is n't being draconian about it			0
that is , he has n't ordered his appointees to run right out and dump their @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 or @entity85 immediately			0
" but i strongly suggested that the next car they buy should be an @entity18 one , and that i had an equally strong expectation that they will do so , " @entity52 said			1
" legally , since they are ' at - will ' employees , i have the right to mandate , and an expectation that they will meet that mandate			2
" @entity47 autos : best hybrid @entity95 some have accused @entity52 of over-stepping his authority by " butting in " to his employees ' private lives , while others have given the policy a hearty " thumbs up			2
" " some of them are not enthusiastic about it , " @entity52 said , noting that one department head currently drives a @entity106 vehicle			0
" but many of these department heads make more than $ 100,000 a year , and i told them that they might not be able to enjoy the economic comforts they currently enjoy if it were not for the amount of taxes that @entity69 and @entity71 pay to the city			0
@entity47 autos : luxury cars with the best @entity119 " i think of it as ' economic patriotism			2
' " @entity52 said he did not know how many of his department heads currently drive imports , although one of his appointees , @entity54 police commissioner @entity126 , guessed that about 90 percent of the appointees already drive @entity18 - made cars			1
" but the ones who are not happy about this -- well , they wo n't talk to [ reporters ] about that , because they know how i feel about it , " said @entity52			0
@entity126 , who drives a @entity135 , supports the mayor 's " buy @entity18 " expectation			1
" i believe that , the way the economy is that @entity140 should be buying @entity18 cars			1
and , as department heads , i think it 's important for us to be setting an example for the other city workers			0
" @entity47 autos : safest cars one of the reasons usually cited for the @entity140 automakers ' loss of market share are consumer perceptions that imports are higher in quality -- although several recent surveys by various research groups have revealed that @entity3 carmakers have closed the " quality gap " in recent years to the point that it is almost negligible			1
and the handful of @entity3 - area residents / natives we talked to about the " @entity18 " debate had no complaints about the quality of their @entity18 - made cars - or their foreign - made ones , for that matter			1
one is @entity172 of @entity173 , @entity28 - the @entity3 suburb that is home to the @entity175 's world headquarters			1
@entity47 autos : most popular crossover vehicles " i drive a 2000 @entity177 , because it was cheaper than a @entity178 , " @entity172 said			0
" and other than brakes and the usual things , i 've had no problems with it , and it now has 101,000 miles on it			0
" @entity172 has an interesting take on the topic of whether we should feel compelled to " buy @entity18 , " when it comes to cars , however - and whether we should be instructed to do so			1
" the average @entity18 probably spends a lot more on other things - clothes , household goods , you name it - than on cars			1
i think it 's hypocritical for someone to tell everyone to ' buy @entity18 ' as it pertains to cars , but then take advantage of the great prices on imported goods at say , @entity202 , " @entity172 said			1
" i 've passed up many good deals , and have abstained from buying a lot of consumer goods i 've wanted over the past year , just to avoid buying foreign - made products			2
" @entity207 , a @entity12 native who 's lived in @entity208 for more than 20 years , drives a 2002 @entity209 , while his wife motors around in a 2001 @entity211			0
" we bought both of them used , from neighbors , " he says			0
" they 've both been good runners			0
the @entity209 is a sweet ride			0
" but i 'm not even sure what it means to ' @entity18 ' anymore , " says @entity207			2
" @entity175 has a huge stake in @entity209 , and @entity223 automakers build most of their cars for the @entity18 market right here in the @entity140 , with @entity18 labor			1
it 's easier to ' @entity18 ' if you 're purchasing a shirt or case of beer			1
i 'm sure if you disassembled a @entity235 or a @entity236 you would find an appalling number of foreign - made components and assemblies			0
" @entity240 is a @entity3 - area native / resident who gives high marks to quality of his @entity18 - made vehicle			1
for the last couple of years , @entity240 has actually maintained two residences : one in @entity173 and one in @entity248 's @entity247 , in @entity12 - a five - hour drive			0
" i make that commute regularly , about every three weeks , in a 2005 @entity251 that i bought new			0
it now has 103,000 miles on it , and it 's never required anything other than ordinary maintenance , " says @entity240			0
@entity256 grew up in @entity257 , a @entity3 suburb just a few miles from @entity54 , and now lives in @entity258 , in western @entity12			2
@entity256 says he agrees with the " @entity18 " sentiment			2
" i believe what the mayor of @entity54 is doing is okay , " says @entity256			0
" i would n't suppose there are a lot of @entity264 being purchased in @entity265 , @entity266 ( home of @entity268 ) , either			0
" nothing wrong with that			0

@entity3 mayor sparks debate when he tells employees to buy @entity18 cars
@entity9 's financial woes have had impact on @entity28 economy
*customer* : @entity282 to buy @entity18 cars then buy other imported goods
differences in quality between @entity18 and foreign are negligible
