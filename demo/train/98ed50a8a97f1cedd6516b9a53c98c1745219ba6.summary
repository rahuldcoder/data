@entity0 , @entity2 @entity1 and his dog @entity5 poked around the hazelnut grove on @entity7 , a 9,200 - acre luxury resort set in the foggy foothills of @entity2 , one wednesday morning in december			1
they were on the hunt again , though not for deer or waterfowl or the usual @entity2 fare			1
the man and his curly - haired dog were searching for something fancier : @entity18 or black @entity20 truffles			1
black truffles are one of the most sought after ( and expensive ) delicacies in the world			2
often referred to as a " black diamond , " the subterranean fungus can retail for $ 1,000 a pound or cost a diner upward of $ 75 extra for a simple shaving on a dish of creamy pasta or slow - scrambled eggs			0
@entity1 and @entity5 's morning hunt proved fruitless			1
but the pair has had better luck than most sniffing out truffles on @entity38 soil -- a relatively new and wholly unpredictable ground for cultivation			1
" this is not something where you just plant your trees and wait for your fortune to grow , " @entity1 said as @entity5 trotted behind him			1
truffles are a funny fungus ; they grow underground , typically among hazelnut and oak trees , and keep most of their secrets there with them			0
there is a primitive understanding of the climactic and soil conditions required for the fungus to flourish , but cultivation methods are far from foolproof			0
stateside , those practices are in their infancy			1
chefs such as @entity61 of @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64 , certainly would n't mind sourcing truffles closer to home			0
he hosts an annual truffle dinner series and features them prominently in dishes when in season			2
every year , he buys domestic truffles from budding regions like the @entity74 , but the quality is n't as reliable as he 'd like it to be			0
" we 're counting down the minutes , " he said with a hopeful tone			0
" once it clicks , whether it 's @entity80 or someone else , once there 's a tipping point , it will really blow up			0
" enthusiasts describe the truffle 's olfactory @entity86 song , which is part of its allure , as " dank , " " earthy , " " musky , " " pungent " -- the gist is its aroma and taste are unparalleled			2
" it transforms an otherwise ordinary dish into something very extraordinary , " @entity1 said			0
different types of truffles are found all over the world , but the @entity20 and white variety from @entity101 , @entity102 , are the top dogs of the gastronomic set			0
the elusive truffle hunt is often romanticized : man and beast wander into the woods of southwest @entity109 with a shovel and a calling			2
a bird chips , a breeze flows and the storybook closes with " happily ever after			0
" if only it were that simple			0
until recently , the black truffle had been solely imported to the @entity38			1
less than 100 miles away from @entity7 -- in @entity117 , @entity2 , of all places -- that began to change around 2007			1
it all started with another @entity5			1
@entity120 , who grew up mushroom hunting and wrote his @entity122 at @entity123 on black truffle cultivation , set his eyes on eastern @entity2 to try out his fungal knowhow in 1999			1
as if the truffle business does n't sound risky enough , it takes about six to 10 years for a tree with roots that have been inoculated with truffle spores to potentially produce a truffle			1
the season for harvesting runs three months from december to february			0
" i 'll have done everything to two trees next to each other , and one will have truffles and one wo n't , " @entity120 said			0
luckily for @entity120 , something clicked			0
soon , he showed up at the kitchen of @entity7 's restaurants with his basket of epicurean delights and a brochure for @entity2 truffles , though it was only his third sale			1
the first question from proprietor @entity149 : " how come i did n't know about this ? " @entity149 and @entity120 teamed up to seed and sniff out truffles locally			0
enter the four - legged @entity5 , who was sourced by local breeder @entity151 from @entity102 to simplify the hunt			1
@entity1 , a @entity80 employee for 14 - plus years who had previously run the resort 's horse program , was recruited to handle the truffle - hunting canine			1
at the height of @entity120 's truffle business , @entity5 helped haul in 200 pounds in one season			1
" it was a thousand dollars a pound so if you do the arithmetic , that 's a good dog , " @entity1 said			2
in 2009 , @entity120 and his product were written up in @entity168 , where food writer @entity169 called it the " hillbilly truffle			2
" two years earlier , storied @entity173 food writer @entity172 devoted an entire column titled " @entity176 , @entity109 , and now in @entity2 " to his endeavors			1
if we know anything about agriculture , though , it 's that @entity181 holds the reins			0
@entity120 ' hazelnut trees were hit with blight after his initial success , and he had to start over with a new blight - resistant variety			0
" you have to have a temperament that can deal with a lot of anxiety for many years , " @entity120 , 67 , said			2
last year , @entity120 yielded about 60 pounds on his land and sold the majority off to hyper - local ingredient - focused chefs such as @entity196 in @entity197 , @entity198 , and @entity199 in @entity200			0
this year , after a series of unseasonable cold snaps , and only a few days left in the season , he has n't unearthed any truffles of sellable quality			0
" mother nature took its course , " @entity120 said with the matter - of - factness of someone who has been here before			0
back at @entity7 , @entity1 's pin that read " @entity214 " reflected the sun as he crouched beneath a tree to dig up a truffle - scented practice tube that @entity5 found			1
on the days when there is n't any luck , training is a commitment to the cause			0
@entity80 found only one @entity20 truffle last winter on its property			2
if it seems like a wild goose chase , that 's because it is			0
but @entity5 is a @entity226 ; he not only enjoys the chase -- it 's in his dna			1
according to the @entity231 , @entity5 's breed is the only one recognized as a " specialized truffle searcher			1
" " we would n't be talking about any of this if it was n't for @entity5 , " @entity1 said			1
" he has really put everything we 're talking about in cultivating truffles in @entity238 on the map			0
" working like a dog at a @entity242 vineyard now 13 years old , @entity5 is passing the baton through his bloodline by breeding and sharing his skills			1
he and @entity1 travel around the country to help train other canines in areas like @entity249 with an eye on the truffle prize			2
at @entity80 and every where else , they 're hoping it 's not a matter of if , but when , a consistent yield will happen			2
as they say , every dog will have its day .			2

@entity38 truffle production is in its infancy
@entity5 the truffle dog from @entity2 has led the pack in truffle hunting
the @entity2 truffle yield spiked years *ago* and has been *inconsistent* since
