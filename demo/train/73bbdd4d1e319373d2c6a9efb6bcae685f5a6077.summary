waistlines drop , hemlines rise , but the domestic drama never wavers			0
and there 's an outfit for everything			0
that 's the case at @entity7 , the fictional estate at the center of the hit @entity11 period drama			1
costumes from the show have been transported across the pond to one of @entity17 's great houses , where visitors can compare and contrast the lifestyles of the very rich in @entity11 and @entity17			1
the exhibition " costumes of @entity7 " opens march 1 at @entity21 , the historic @entity22 estate where @entity17 industrialist @entity23 lived and entertained lavishly in the early part of the 20th century			1
" @entity21 was run kind of like a great resort hotel in its heyday			1
there were 34 indoor servants , and that was really to take care of mr. and mrs. @entity23 , their two daughters and their house guests when they came to visit , " said @entity28 , director of public programs at @entity21 and one of the exhibit 's curators			1
the " @entity7 " exhibit features 40 costumes worn upstairs and downstairs by the fictional @entity42 , @entity43 , his family and their staff of servants			1
the costumes are on loan from @entity50 , a prominent costumier for film , theater and television			2
the " @entity7 " series has moved from its start in 1912 into the @entity57 of the 1920s , and the exquisite costumes have evolved with the times			1
in women 's dresses , " what we 're really seeing through the seasons is the waistline dropping and the hem beginning to rise , " @entity28 said			0
the shape of women 's wear also changes , with sinuous form - flattering silhouettes giving way to less structured clothing			0
' @entity7 ' in @entity17 : 6 big estates " by the 1920s , you 've got all of these loose - hanging , very short dresses , " said @entity75 , @entity21 's director of collections and senior curator of textiles			1
" fashion history is following right along with cultural history in terms of votes for women , women working outside of the home , women needing the ability for movement , losing their corsets , more natural silhouettes , less underclothing , " @entity75 said			0
men 's clothing changes far less on the show , @entity28 said			0
tweeds worn at the time are still popular today in different cuts			0
@entity102 and his gentlemen contemporaries wore tweed suits around their country estates in the daytime			0
they would not , however , have worn tweeds to town			0
" there was kind of a catchphrase at the time of ' no brown in town , ' " @entity28 said			0
things had loosened up a bit by the 1920s and " @entity7 's " season four , which just concluded for @entity17 television audiences			1
black tie was becoming an alternative -- in certain less formal circumstances -- to white tie and tails in the evening			0
the exhibit contrasts country house life in @entity11 and the @entity17 using fictional @entity7 and real - life @entity21			1
the differences ? for one , @entity17 have long loved their technology			1
" @entity17 love the history and style of @entity11 and the sporting life and kind of the gentleman 's lifestyle , but @entity17 were completely devoted to the latest technology , modern conveniences and comfortable living			1
" 8 elegant @entity17 mansion hotels @entity21 had its own telephone system with 95 exchanges by the time it was overhauled by @entity23 in the early 1930s			1
it also had central heating and 23 bathrooms			0
in " @entity7 , " anxiety accompanies the arrival of technological advances for many of the characters			1
bringing the latest technology to @entity17 estates was easier , @entity75 said , because homes were newer and successive generations were likely to regularly renovate to put their own stamp on the home			2
@entity17 's melting pot was also evident at @entity21 when the du pont family was in residence , with a @entity163 valet and a @entity165 ladies maid among many nationalities represented in the household			1
" the diversity of nationalities who work in these great houses really reflects the diversity of nationalities who were coming to @entity17 , " @entity28 said			2
in @entity11 , servants had more direct ties to local villages and tenant farms			0
what newly wealthy @entity17 lacked in centuries - old tradition , they made up for in money			2
" by the late 19th century the @entity17 were the ones with all the money , " said @entity75			2
" @entity7 " illustrates that wealth through @entity102 's @entity17 wife @entity187 , whose fortune has kept the estate from ruin , and her mother -- who occasionally sails in from @entity191 sporting the very latest fashions			1
" wealthy @entity17 were not at all behind , " @entity75 said			2
" they traveled , they frequented all of the best couture designers in both @entity195 and @entity196			0
" yet the @entity17 fascination with all things @entity11 is still very much alive and well			2
the exhibition is on view at @entity21 through january 2015			2
the museum recommends advance purchase of the timed tickets			0
entry to the exhibit is included in general admission , which is $ 20 for adults .			0
