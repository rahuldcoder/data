-- from the scorched corn fields of @entity3 , to the storm - lashed hills of @entity6 , an increasingly volatile climate is posing ever greater challenges for farmers around the world			1
but opportunity is arising from crisis , through next - generation climate analysis tools that could make agriculture - the world 's largest industry - vastly more efficient and profitable			1
the @entity16 , founded by two ex-google engineers , is dragging a famously technophobic industry into the digital era			0
through exhaustive data modeling and an elite pool of climate and agriculture analysts , the @entity16 is seeking to take guesswork out of the field			1
" the increasing uncertainty in agriculture , with the changing patterns of weather we are seeing , is making it difficult for farmers to grow successful crops consistently , " says ceo @entity26			1
" the tools we provide help farmers make smarter decisions based on analytical techniques , rather than intuition			2
" data revolution @entity26 sees " huge opportunities " to revolutionize a vast industry that employs over one billion people and occupies almost half the planet 's total land , but has not adapted to the possibilities of data , despite its vulnerability to climate change			1
the @entity16 's model produces hyper - local climate forecasts for individual farms , using satellite imaging , growth modeling and simulations			1
this is supported by decades of data , much of it from government sources , covering crop performance , soil properties , moisture levels and weather			1
the free " basic " platform allows farmers to monitor their land and crops , while the " @entity71 " platform includes a suite of features such as to optimize use of nitrogen fertilizer , control pests , and plan perfect harvests			2
" fertilizer is the number one expense for farmers and they are basically throwing away money , " says @entity26			2
" we can help farmers decide how much fertilizer to put in the field at what point in the season , reducing what goes into the atmosphere and waterways , so that 100 % goes to plants to deliver food			2
" while @entity26 is a strict vegetarian and keen to support environmental protection , his priority is to convince farmers with an economic argument			2
" i do n't see collective action on climate change in agriculture			1
we need to create commercial incentives to change behavior , that 's where we can be successful			2
" the company estimate they can make $ 20 billion in efficiency savings in the @entity106 by applying their data models , and increase corn field yields by 30 % an acre			2
" our initial results show a 10 - 20 % increase in yield , " said @entity111 , a @entity112 farmer that uses the software			0
more with less with the @entity120 's agriculture body claiming that the food supply needs to increase 70 % by 2050 to meet the needs of a growing population , without cultivating new farmland , there is an imperative for the industry to do more with less			2
the challenge is daunting but the @entity16 's ambitions are on a global scale			0
having been recently acquired by @entity129 in a $ 1 billion deal -- which @entity26 claims has not altered its work -- the group has vast resources			0
its technology covers 50 million acres in the @entity106 , including a third of total land for corn and soybean , serving thousands of farmers			0
this figure is growing rapidly , and its platforms will be rolled out internationally from 2015			0
that level of adoption would enable dramatic changes in the industry			0
@entity26 would like to see farmers choosing different crops to suit the climate data -- such as switching from wheat to corn in @entity153 as the weather warms -- and planning five - season cycles that use a better understanding of the changing properties of soil			1
optimal performance the opportunities for data in agriculture are also shown by @entity163 , a @entity165 startup that emerged from one of the state 's worst ever droughts			1
" around the world , water stress has been one of first impacts of climate change on agriculture , " says founder @entity169			1
" but most farmers still have n't adopted water saving techniques			0
" with award - winning designer @entity177 , @entity163 produced a multi-faceted sensor that allows growers to micro-manage their plots , providing constant readings on moisture level , with a connected water valve that keeps the level optimal			0
it also gives readings of light , temperature , humidity and fertility so that even inexperienced users can sustain high performance yields			0
the device , which more than trebled its crowdfunding goal , is initially targeted at smaller growers			0
but @entity169 wants to build immense data sets from environmental input , which would scale to the needs of high volume food production			0
the sensor is undergoing trials with major farm operators			0
@entity169 is confident about the integration of data , but believes the industry must change now to protect livelihoods and the environment			1
" it 's a question of when , not if , " he says			0
" this is as big an opportunity as the @entity212 was , in one of the last big industries that has not adopted big data			1
" if we do nothing , more farmers will have to leave their land over the next decades ... which means creating new farmland , which would have a dramatic environmental impact			0
" data modeling in agriculture has great potential , believes @entity226 , author of " @entity227 , " an investigation of how businesses are adapting to climate change and in some cases seeking to exacerbate it			1
" @entity234 local data ca n't hurt macro farming , although it 's still early for the science and we may not see the full effects for five or 10 years , " says @entity226			1
" if efficiencies deliver profits that will be a major incentive for change			0
" @entity226 adds that improving efficiency of existing farmland would have less negative effects than cultivating new land , and hopes the concept is expanded			0
" i do n't think there 's a problem with people making money from climate change			2
my only concern is whether the technology would be expanded to farmers everywhere , whether they can afford it in places like the @entity256 , otherwise the effects ( of climate change ) will continue to get worse			1
" with the right information , even the most extreme conditions can be profitable			0

@entity234 local climate analysis enables profit from weather
agriculture has " huge opportunity " after *neglecting* big data until now
farmers must change where , what and how they grow
livelihoods and environment under threat without *urgent* action
