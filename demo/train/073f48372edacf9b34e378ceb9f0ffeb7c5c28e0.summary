it is noon , and the light filters softly through the water			0
@entity4 , camera in tow , drifts to the sea floor to capture an intimate portrait of a @entity10 man			1
in the dreamlike photograph , the @entity10 extends his hand upward as though he were dancing			1
" all these movements they do with their hands , " @entity4 said			1
" they 're trying to keep themselves down ( on the seafloor ) , move forward or stay in place			0
" the @entity10 are a tribe of nomadic sea dwellers who have lived off the shore of northeast @entity24 for more than 200 years			1
they are a stateless people with no nationality in the traditional sense , residing instead in boats and living off the sea			1
as highly skilled divers , the @entity10 are able to walk along the seafloor hunting for fish and pearls			2
@entity4 sought to photograph the @entity10 as part of a larger project about stateless people that has taken him to places such as @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and the @entity43 territories			1
" the project is a question , " @entity4 said			1
" why do we need to have flags and borders ? " @entity4 said that in recent years , increasing amounts of @entity10 are transitioning to a life on land			1
their background as a stateless people , however , awards them no recognition by the @entity59 government or access to things such as health care or education			1
" they do n't speak @entity65 or even know how old they are , " @entity4 said			2
despite the pull toward a more modern way of living , there are still @entity10 who choose life at sea			2
but even sea dwellers feel the effects of modernization			0
" they do n't dive so much anymore , " @entity4 said			2
" they use more modern methods ( of fishing )			0
they sell fish to different companies and tourists , even to land @entity84			0
" @entity4 wanted his photographs to reflect the essence of their statelessness , to create a sort of " imaginary stateless nation			1
" the images are ethereal and emotional underwater portraits of the @entity10 in their natural environment			1
social media follow @ @entity95 on @entity96 to join the conversation about photography			0
" i wanted to show who they are , " he said			0
" i did n't want to create some sort of anthropology catalog			0
i wanted to go beyond who 's who			0
these underwater portraits were perfect for that			1
" this project was the first time @entity4 photographed underwater			1
" i had never even dived before , " he said			0
underwater photography requires special equipment , like housing for the camera , and the weather conditions must be perfect			2
" the sea must be calm and the water must be clean , " he said			0
" you need the sun to be as high as possible			0
" although the type of diving @entity4 did with the @entity10 can be dangerous , he did it without an oxygen tank			1
he experienced rain and a hailstorm his first two days of shooting			0
around the third day , @entity4 began to gain the trust of the @entity10 and they , in turn , began to understand the type of image @entity4 wanted			1
" they 're posing in all of the pictures , " @entity4 said			2
" i told them , ' i want to show what you normally do			0
' after we got the first picture , they understood what we wanted			0
" the soft light and the way the @entity10 pose in the water reflect the " imaginary stateless nation " @entity4 wanted to convey , causing the viewer to examine the relationship between place and identity			1
" it 's abstract , " @entity4 said			2
" the concept of nations has always been malleable			0
" @entity4 is a @entity150 photographer			2
he is one of the founders of me - @entity153 .			0

the @entity10 have lived off the shore of northeast @entity24 for more than 200 years
@entity4 took underwater portraits of them as part of his project on stateless people
