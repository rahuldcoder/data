-- a 20 - year - old man died sunday after being shot with a @entity5 device during a scuffle with a sheriff 's deputy in @entity8 , a spokeswoman for the @entity2 said			1
@entity9 blames dozens of deaths on police use of stun guns			1
cpl. @entity13 said deputies responding to a report of a fight in progress arrived at the location in @entity19 , @entity8 , just before 5 a.m. et and found four people fighting			1
a deputy used a taser device on one of the men , who fell unconscious , @entity13 said			1
the man was taken to @entity26 , where he was pronounced dead			2
his identity was not immediately released , pending the notification of his family			0
the deputy , who has not been identified publicly , has been placed on administrative leave with pay pending the completion of an investigation , @entity13 said			0
@entity9 has reported that , since june 2001 , more than 150 people have died in the @entity36 after being subdued with a stun gun			1
the organization has called for police departments to suspend use of the devices pending study of their possible risks			2
few have done so , said @entity9 , which added that more than 7,000 of the nation 's 18,000 law enforcement agencies use the devices			2
last month , a police officer in @entity48 in @entity49 used a taser device on a distraught 40 - year - old man on his first airplane trip outside @entity53			1
in a statement released friday , @entity54 cited the @entity48 case and said it " appears to follow the pattern of many in - custody deaths or deaths following a confrontation with police			1
@entity62 , medical science and forensic analysis has shown that these deaths are attributable to other factors and not the low - energy electrical discharge of the @entity5			0
" a bystander 's video of the @entity48 incident that showed the victim continuing to struggle after being shot with the device " is proof that the taser device was not the cause of his death , " the company said on its web site			1
cardiac arrest caused by electrical current would have caused immediate death , it said			0
in addition , " the video clearly shows symptoms of excited delirium , a potentially fatal condition marked by symptoms of exhaustion and mania such as heavy breathing , profuse sweating , confusion , disorientation and violence toward inanimate objects , " the company said			0
" we are taken aback by the number of media outlets that have irresponsibly published conclusive headlines blaming the @entity5 device and / or the law enforcement officers involved as the cause of death before completion of the investigation , " said @entity97 , the company 's founder and chairman of the board			0
but @entity9 , noting that coroners have identified @entity5 as a contributory factor in more than 30 deaths , said such a link can not be ruled out			2
the devices use compressed nitrogen to shoot two probes -- connected to the device by wire -- up to 35 feet away at speeds exceeding 100 mph			0
an electrical signal transmitted through the wires contacts the body or clothing , " resulting in an immediate loss of the person 's neuromuscular control and the ability to perform coordinated action for the duration of the impulse , " according to the company			0
