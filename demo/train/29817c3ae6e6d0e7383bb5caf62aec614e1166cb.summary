-- in space , astronauts go for years without a fresh supply of water			2
floating in a capsule in outer space they wash and drink from the same continuously recycled source			2
so why , asked @entity11 industrial designer @entity10 , do we not do the same on @entity13 ? this was the concept behind the @entity16 -- a high - tech purification system that recycles water while you wash			1
in the eyes of @entity10 , we should start doing it now , before it becomes a necessity			1
so how does it work ? similar to space showers , it works on a " closed loop system : " hot water falls from the tap to the drain and is instantly purified to drinking water standard and then pumped back out of the showerhead			2
as the process is quick , the water remains hot and only needs to be reheated very slightly			2
as a result , it saves more than 90 % in water usage and 80 % in energy every time you shower , while also producing water that is cleaner than your average tap			1
" with my shower , which is constantly recycling water , you 'd only use about five liters of water for a 10 minute shower ... in a regular shower you would use 150 liters of water -- 30 times as much			1
it 's a lot of savings , " explains @entity10			1
according to research carried out by his company , @entity57 , these savings translate to at least â ‚ ¬ 1000 ( $ 1351 ) off your energy bills each year			1
@entity10 proposed the @entity16 shower while studying @entity61 at the @entity62 in @entity11			1
his concept formed part of a collaborative project with @entity67 's @entity66 , which looks to drive design concepts that could potentially assist space expeditions			0
" in an extreme environment such as a space mission to @entity73 , design concepts are brought forward to use all of the possible resources to make it there and back			0
i do n't see any reason why we ca n't be as efficient on @entity13 as we can be in space , " he says			0
according to the @entity82 @entity81 ( @entity81 ) , 1.2 trillion gallons of water are used every year for showering in the @entity82 alone			2
and yet , rather disturbingly , across the world more than three times the population of the @entity82 lacks access to any clean water at all			0
the concept of a water - saving shower is by no means a new one , but when @entity0 's blueprint team caught up with @entity10 at his offices in @entity92 , southern @entity11 , he explained that because it does n't compromise on comfort , it 's different to the rest			1
it has a higher than average water pressure and a very stable flow because , unlike conventional showers , it works independently from other appliances			0
this year , his showers were installed for the first time in @entity104 , a coastal bathing house in @entity11			1
during the summer months more than 1000 bathers come and swim waters rich with plankton , algae and seaweed , before showering off			0
" it 's not just an exotic environment for application but it 's an extreme field test because the showers are on pretty much constantly , for about 10 hours per day ... and the feedback has been good			0
" at the bathing house , @entity0 introduced @entity10 to @entity119 industrial designer @entity118 , who recently designed @entity92 's @entity121 train station			1
@entity118 was keen to talk about the wider potential of @entity10 's design : " my interest is not in the objects but in the system			2
there will be so many applications for this			0
" if deployed on a bigger scale , the purification technology developed for @entity16 could be used in taps and drinking fountains in the world 's developing countries , where water - related illness is rife			1
" everybody should save as many resources as possible , " says @entity10 , " but obviously these showers would be even more beneficial for people living in areas with water shortages			1
" i want to get it to as many people as possible			0
that 's the next step			0
it 's not just about saving water			0
the motivation is to be smart about how we use our planet 's resources			0

@entity11 designer @entity10 has developed a shower that recycles water
@entity16 saves more than 90 % water and 80 % energy while you wash
it could save users over $ 1000 a year and help people living in areas with a shortage of water
