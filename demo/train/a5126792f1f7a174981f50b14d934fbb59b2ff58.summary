but @entity4 knew the price tag was hefty : around $ 15,000			1
" i told them no , " said @entity4 , then 39 , recalling the exact moment			1
" i felt like i was not worth that			2
" her mom , @entity4 , said the two older women knew something had to be done since diabetes runs in the family			1
" we were just desperate , " @entity4 said			1
" we ( also ) knew her heart was n't going to be able to carry this weight forever			1
" @entity4 's rejection of the offer devastated her family			1
but @entity4 had made up her mind to take matters into her own hands to lose the weight			1
" if i was going to do this , i ( was ) going to do it the right way			2
@entity32 ( was ) going to do it the healthy way , and i ( was ) not going to rely on somebody else , " she said			2
in denial corn 's weight problem had begun in high school in @entity40 , @entity41			1

she attended her weekly saturday morning meetings without the dread she had in her 2008 attempt			0
instead of focusing on her goal of losing 150 pounds , the @entity116 , @entity117 , resident attempted to achieve smaller goals like 5 , 10 and 25 pounds			1
the first six months of her weight - loss journey , @entity4 focused strictly on her diet			1
after she had lost about 40 pounds , she started walking the neighborhood in addition to using her treadmill at home			1

now it 's all about high - protein and high - fiber foods , salads and healthy snacks			0
and , of course , lots of water throughout the day			0
" i do allow myself a piece of chocolate here and there , some ice cream here and there , as long as i pre-arrange for it in my mind , " she said			0
" i would feel deprived if i could n't have those , and then that 's usually when i go completely off the rails			0
" one step at a time @entity4 hit her goal weight of 163 pounds in march			1

" " to me , it 's not about being skinny , it 's about being healthy , " she said			0
@entity4 has a message for others facing their own weight problems			1
" first , you do n't have to have a movie - star budget to do this , " she said			0

" this was a person ( who ) , if i would have paid her $ 1,000 to step on a treadmill , she would n't have done it , " @entity4 said			1
