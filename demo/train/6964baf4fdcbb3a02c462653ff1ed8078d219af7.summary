@entity0 , @entity1 -- the shooting spree by taxi driver @entity4 across @entity5 , northern @entity1 has brought painful reminders of other mass shootings in the @entity8			1
the @entity8 already has some of the toughest gun control laws in the world , introduced in the wake of two infamous @entity8 mass shootings			1
in 1987 , @entity13 , 27 , killed 16 people in the southern @entity1 town of @entity16 , @entity17 , as he went on the rampage for several hours armed with a pistol , a hand grenade and an automatic rifle			2
among @entity13 's victims were his mother , a policeman who tried to stop him and a woman who was picnicking in a nearby wood with her two children			0
@entity13 , who wore combat fatigues while he carried out the massacre , was eventually tracked down to an unoccupied college building , where he shot himself			0
the @entity8 government introduced new legislation following the massacre under the @entity32 of 1988 , making it registration mandatory for owning shotguns and banning semi-automatic and pump - action weapons			1
nine years later @entity36 , a former @entity37 leader , entered a school gym in the small @entity40 town of @entity41 , @entity40			0
he opened fire on a group of five - and six - year children , killing 16 pupils and their teacher before killing himself			0

police interview applicants who must disclose criminal convictions and explain why s / he wants a firearm			0
checks are also made with the applicant 's doctor -- sometimes to make sure the doctor does not have concerns about the applicant owning a weapon -- and sometimes independent medical advice can be sought			0
calls for gun control in the @entity8 are at their fiercest following mass shootings such as @entity16 , @entity41 and now @entity5			1
did you see anything ? send us photos , images during the recent @entity8 election , however , gun control barely figured amid the literature of the main political parties			1
