-- once again , @entity1 is at a crossroads			1
former @entity4 secretary - general @entity3 deserves applause for brokering a ceasefire in a conflict where others have failed , and where some have been only too ready to press military buttons			2
despite the seeming success of diplomacy , the conflict in @entity1 is far from over			2
this is only a new beginning			0
make no mistake : @entity3 's mission was not accepted by the regime in @entity18 because they were instinctively in line with his thinking			1
@entity3 was embraced by the @entity21 , @entity22 , and @entity23 because he had come conveniently after the brutal killings in @entity25 and @entity26			1
it was more timing than principle			0
if @entity3 had come while parts of @entity26 and @entity25 were under rebel control , then president @entity30 and his backers would have rejected the @entity4 mission			1
now that @entity30 has regained territory from the opposition , he is keen to be seen as a peacemaker			1
@entity3 's proposals are ambitious , morally right , and urgently needed			1
from the need for a political process where opposition elements and the regime are in direct talks , to troop withdrawals , to providing humanitarian assistance , to releasing those arbitrarily detained and allowing free media access to respecting the freedom to protest peacefully			2
but @entity30 violated all of these principles previously , so why would he behave any differently now ? his calculation must be altered to realize that the fear that he and his father , @entity53 , had instilled in the hearts of many @entity23 is now gone			1
suppressing popular protests with tanks can not be repeated constantly with impunity , particularly after the @entity59 presidential elections			0
the political will of the occupant of the @entity62 next january could be stronger on intervening in @entity1			0
it is a question of time before the conflict in @entity1 flares up again			0
@entity3 and the countries involved will only contain , mitigate and offset the parties for a limited time while the opposition regroups			2
too much blood has been spilled , too many wounds are open to pretend that violence will not resume again			0
( indeed , there were reports after the agreement was reached that violence had resumed in several areas of the country , where government troops were accused of shelling and burning homes , killing dozens			0
) while @entity3 's mission hopes to bring all sides to the table , the @entity23 government and opposition can not risk the continuing escalation of violence			1
the answers to the conflict in @entity1 do not come from outside intervention , but from inside @entity1 's opposition movement			1
those within the opposition who have opted for violence must immediately return to nonviolence			0
the lesson of this last year is that the @entity30 regime will meet opposition violence with a disproportionate response and fight to the death			1
with no coherent leadership , with deep disunity and no real vision for a new @entity1 , the opposition is fighting for an empty cause			2
it is more productive in the long term , therefore , that it uses the hiatus provided by @entity3 to peacefully mobilize the masses inside @entity18 and @entity111 , publish a manifesto that gains purchase from minority @entity23 that sectarian violence will not rise in a @entity1 , and bring on board the major religious , tribal and business figures inside country			1
such measures will help build confidence among noninterventionists in the @entity122 , and will result in defections from the military and diplomatic top brass in @entity30 's government			1
failure to do the hard work at the grass - roots level inside @entity1 while demanding @entity131 military support would be both @entity133 ve and dangerous			0
conversely , the regime knows its days are numbered			0
it can not butcher dissidents in @entity25 and @entity26 and expect to rule the country without introducing serious , substantial reforms			0
the constitutional referendum last month was held in haste to address the demand for this very thing			0
not only does @entity30 need to win over the opposition 's more pragmatic actors , but it must demonstrate adherence to @entity3 's plan			1
but knowing the conniving and deceptive nature of this regime , i do not believe it will sincerely adhere to the letter and spirit of the @entity3 proposals			2
@entity3 may well prove to be @entity30 's last gamble			1
if he flunks this opportunity to allow for the six - point plan to demonstrably materialize , then it will be nigh impossible to stop @entity131 firepower from pounding his presidential palace , apartments in @entity162 , military barracks and bases in the @entity166 mountains in @entity167 , @entity168 and elsewhere			0
for his own sake , for the sake of his family and countrymen , @entity30 must deliver			0
@entity3 is his last warning , and last chance			2
he would be well advised to accept the invitations from @entity176 and @entity177 to go into exile , save himself and his family from further danger , and rescue @entity1 from the increased risk of all - out civil war			0
the onus is on @entity30 , as much as it is on the opposition to illustrate that it can unite and offer a credible alternative to him			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			0

@entity189 says @entity3 's deal with @entity1 's government is a new chance for regime
he says the plan to stop violence , allow humanitarian aid and more , is correct , *crucial*
he says @entity30 is *n't* *trustworthy* , but if pact fails his chance at *avoiding* world response is slim
@entity189 : @entity23 government must stand down , opposition must unite to form credible alternative
