shipping companies may have found a new tool to fight piracy : it turns out , pirates like to tweet			1
not only that , @entity7 - based pirates blog and are on @entity8 , security experts say			1
and it is through social media that shipping companies are increasing their understanding of how they operate			1
" @entity7 is a very sophisticated economy , it has one of the best mobile phone communication systems in the world , " said @entity13 , director of intelligence at @entity15 , a risk consultancy			1
@entity20 follows pirates ' activities using what she describes as " normal " web tools			2
she gathers whatever individuals and organizations like @entity29 's @entity7 affiliate @entity28 post online about attacks			1
the insurgent organization runs a @entity33 account where it publicizes its activities			1
the @entity33 account has been a part of the debate over whether terrorist organizations should be allowed to use @entity33			1
@entity33 does not take responsibility for the accuracy and appropriateness of user content in its terms of service			2
another source for her is the @entity47 army , which @entity20 describes as fully engaged in online exchanges with @entity28			0
@entity50 territory for @entity28 in chaos of @entity7 other organizations , like the @entity53 , document pirate attacks and tweet about them			1
while , for example , @entity28 may claim an attack was carried out , @entity20 will confirm this claim with other online sources , like the @entity47 army or the @entity53			0
@entity20 has put together data from social media , mainstream media , academics , governmental organizations , and @entity66 to create a virtual representation of the social networking web of pirates in @entity7			1
her work -- aggregated from online sources -- has drawn the interest of shippers and government intelligence agencies			0
her work was on display at a recent shipping conference in @entity79 , where more than half the conference dealt with risks and crises in this field , suggesting the industry 's growing concern with violence and piracy			1
but the same weakness @entity20 exploits can favor criminals			0
shipping companies , like all listed enterprises , are required to disclose information like vessel sizes , their expenses in armed escorts and usual routes			2
pirates are armed with increasingly sophisticated technology and ample online access to stay ahead of the game			0
as a result , the high - seas clash between pirates and commercial shippers is becoming more of a technology race , security experts say			2
" [ @entity98 ] are being more understanding of the shipping industry , because of the @entity115 and the money they 've got through ransom payments , they bought themselves the laptops , they 've got their iphones and their @entity121 , " said @entity108 , director of maritime and security services at @entity111			1
@entity108 said pirates look at shipping schedules and the protection measures aboard to select targets			2
in 2011 , the total cost of piracy was $ 7 billion , according to a report by @entity129 , an @entity66			1
@entity108 considers this estimate conservative			0
meanwhile , the same report said that ransoms were 2 % of these total costs			0
re-routing ships is piracy 's biggest cost , estimated at $ 2.4 billion a year , or about a third of the total			1
other growing piracy costs for shippers are insurance premiums and security equipment			2
nevertheless , @entity143 states that while successful attacks are decreasing due to improving counter measures , ransoms and the time a ship is held have increased			0
longer kidnap times for seafarers implies a series of problems that pirates solve through specialization : while some attack ships on sea , others supply a number of services on land			0
" it 's like a supply chain ... you have the attackers , they 're the guys on the skiffs , approaching the vessel , boarding the vessel and getting the hostages ; you got the guy who sets himself up as the negotiator ; you got the guy that manages the vessel and the hostages , " @entity108 told @entity160			0
" there are different actors brought in for their specialist function			0
" as more people get involved in these operations , their impact reverberates throughout local communities			0
@entity7 earn on average about $ 600 a year , according to the @entity185 , so a $ 1 million ransom payment can be a boon to local operators involved in an aspect of the pirate trade , analysts said			1
many people in @entity7 are aware of what 's going on , and they talk about it on @entity33 and other social media			1
still , analysts face the same problems social media encounters elsewhere			1
" actually getting verified information from within @entity7 is very difficult , because anybody can tweet , anybody can post anything , " @entity20 said			2
therefore , @entity33 is only one source that undergoes a validation process before accepting these bits of information as usable , she said			2
" first we look at corroboration of data , " she said			0
the analyst tries to compare tweets to recognized sources reporting on piracy like the @entity53			0
if data ca n't be matched to a report by the @entity53 or other trusted organization , she seeks to understand who 's behind it			0
" if you can understand their agenda , you can understand where they 're coming from judging that piece of information , " she said			0
militant groups use @entity33 as propaganda , whereas others could be trying relay a fact , according to the analyst			2
and if these two steps fail , and the information is still valuable , @entity20 includes it in her analysis with a full disclosure of source and circumstance , she said .			0

pirates are using @entity33 , @entity8 and other social media to do their business
security analysts are using social media *chatter* to better understand the pirate trade
in 2011 , the total cost of piracy to the shipping industry was estimated at $ 7 billion
