-- with the presidential race heading into its final stretch , both candidates vow to protect the sacred promises made to military families			1
but neither is offering any details on how they might support military families if we hit a fiscal cliff with budget cuts that could wipe out services for military and veterans ' families			1
month after month , in the midst of a heated presidential and congressional pre-election cycle , we see no organized blueprint to integrate millions of military family members into civilian society			2
since 2001 , more than 2 million troops have returned from the wars in @entity24 and @entity25			2
they have spent less time at home than service members in the past because of frequent deployments , making readjustment and life at home for families harder than ever			0
today , as the military drawdown in @entity25 proceeds , tens of thousands of military members are returning to uncertainty about their and their families ' future			1
what services will be cut ? will it be medical care , mental health services or school supports for children ? the @entity48 barely mentioned military and veteran families			1
the @entity50 was a great homage to our vets but did n't revealed specific plans for programs that president @entity56 would support			1
after more than 10 years of war in @entity24 and men and women in uniform continuing to die in @entity25 , this silence on a national plan or funding for services only increases the stress and uncertainty that military families feel every day			2
with all the public celebration of military families on the campaign trail , this lack of proposals for new resources or a detailed plan of how federal agencies will coordinate the integration of returning troops seems like a violation of our nation 's promise and its social contract with the millions of brave warriors and their families			1
no one doubts @entity84 and @entity85 honor and care about military families			0
but words and public recognition are not enough			0
" @entity95 , " led by @entity96 and @entity97 , is the @entity56 administration 's broad initiative involving the public and private sectors to help provide services and opportunities for military members and their families			1
last year , this campaign waged by large corporations , nonprofit organizations and universities raised the visibility of the needs of military families and veterans			0
this national leadership is exactly what we need as a nation			0
but it is not enough			0
it must be on a much larger scale , backed up with federal resources			0
@entity56 's directive last year that all federal agencies cooperate and use existing resources to help military families was also a huge step in the right direction			1
but keeping that sacred vow to military and veteran families will require a federally led partnership with civilian society that provides full spectrum of programs designed to make the transition from military member to civilian a smooth one			0
both parties seem to be waiting for the elections to be over and are accepting the possibility of deep , across - the - board cuts in the @entity132 if @entity133 does n't reach a budget compromise during the post-election period			0
but before the election , both candidates should provide detailed plans or at least debate their stance on federally supported programs for military and veteran families			1
our political leaders should be striving to expand @entity144 services to meet the growing demand			0
at minimum , those leaving the military need the education , employment , health and mental health services they were promised			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity156 .			2

@entity156 : we need plans to provide services for returning vets if *defense* is deeply cut
@entity156 : candidates laud military members but provide no detailed plans for *re-integration*
tens of thousands back from wars wonder what services will survive , he says
@entity156 : @entity56 " @entity95 " is great , but it needs to be expanded with federal funds
