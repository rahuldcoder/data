-- a multi-million dollar negligence lawsuit filed by the families of two victims of the 2007 @entity5 mass shooting has been dismissed by @entity7 's highest court			1
the state justices said thursday that given the initial uncertainty and confusion surrounding the actions of the student gunman , " there was no duty for the @entity11 to warn students about the potential for criminal acts by third parties , " meaning gunman @entity16			2
he went on a shooting rampage on the @entity24 , @entity7 , campus that left 32 people dead			1
the young man then took his own life			2
a county jury had awarded the estates of @entity30 and @entity31 $ 4 million each , saying the state was negligent			1
the amount was later reduced to $ 100,000 per family			1
the women were students at the state university			2
@entity37 timeline there was no initial reaction from the families , but a spokesman for state attorney general @entity43 said the justices ' conclusions were proper			0
" while words can not express the tremendous sympathy we have for the families who lost their loved ones in the @entity5 shootings of 2007 -- including the @entity53 and the @entity54 -- the @entity46 has found what we have said all along to be true : the commonwealth and its officials at @entity5 were not negligent on april 16 , 2007 , " said @entity56			1
" @entity16 was the lone person responsible for this tragedy			0
" @entity43 is the @entity61 nominee for governor , and the general election is next tuesday			0
at issue was the level of responsibility the state -- including university officials , as well as local and campus police -- should bear for the initial handling of @entity16 's actions , which eventually spread out over several hours			1
could his final rampage be reasonably foreseen ? law enforcement on april 16 , 2007 , received a call of an incident inside a dormitory around 7:30 a.m. officers arrived to find two gunshot victims , one fatal , and initially believed it be a " domestic homicide , " not a prelude to far more lethal killing spree to come			1
" police believed that this was an isolated incident that posed no danger to others and that the shooter had fled the area , " said the @entity46 's 15 - page ruling			2
" they did not believe that a campus lockdown was necessary			0
" lawyers for the families had argued if such a precautionary lockdown was imposed immediately -- where students and the university community would be told to shelter in place -- the subsequent massacre inside an academic building may have been prevented or minimized			0
a killer in the family the court concluded university officials were engaged and kept informed of the situation over time			2
two hours after the initial incident , members of the @entity106 -- consisting of school administrators -- sent out a campus - wide " blast e-mail , " informing students and faculty of the dorm shooting , and urging those to report anything suspicious			0
the mass shooting in @entity115 began about 10 minutes later , prompting another immediate university " blast e-mail " stating " a gunman is loose on campus			0
stay in buildings until further notice			0
" @entity30 , 18 , and @entity122 , 23 were among those murdered by @entity16 in @entity115			0
he was later linked to both the residence hall and academic building shootings			0
in general under state law , someone does not have a legal duty to warn or protect from someone else the criminal acts of a third person , unless a " special relationship " exists between one or more parties			0
such relations might include those between employer / employee , airline / passenger , or innkeeper / guest			0
all such claims of wrongdoing in this context are fact - specific , and the @entity7 court here determined the state reasonably -- if incorrectly -- determined the shooter had left the area			1
" based on the limited information available to the @entity11 prior to the shootings in @entity115 , " said the seven justices , " it can not be said that it was known or reasonably foreseeable that students in @entity115 would fall victim to criminal harm			2
" school officials expressed satisfaction with the court 's conclusions , saying the jury 's initial verdict was based on a misreading of state law			1
" the court 's actions can never reverse the loss of lives nor the pain experienced by so many families and friends of victims of one person			1
in the end , the cause of these heinous acts and continuing heartbreak was a troubled and angry young man with easy access to powerful killing weapons , " said @entity172 , associate vice president at @entity5 the case is @entity11 ( 121717 ) .			1

*plaintiffs* initially awarded $ 4 million each in negligence lawsuit
award later reduced to $ 100,000 each
@entity7 's highest court said @entity5 that slaughter was not " reasonably foreseeable "
