the director of the @entity2 health care system and two others have been placed on administrative leave amid claims of a secret waiting list and claims that 40 - plus veterans died waiting for care			1
these allegations have been exposed in a series of exclusive reports by the @entity13 unit			1
the announcement thursday by @entity16 secretary of veterans affairs @entity15 came a day after officials at the @entity18 denied in interviews with @entity13 the existence of such a list , only to be called liars hours later by the top @entity18 physician who first appeared on @entity13 and brought the allegations to light			1
" we believe it is important to allow an independent , objective review to proceed , " @entity15 said in a written statement			1
" ... these allegations , if true , are absolutely unacceptable and if the inspector general 's investigation substantiates these claims , swift and appropriate action will be taken			0
" those placed on leave , according to the statement , are @entity2 va director @entity37 , associate director @entity38 and a third employee , who was not identified by name			1
retired @entity18 doctor : there 's a secret wait list in @entity44 @entity15 's office denied repeated requests by @entity13 over six months to interview the secretary about the allegations			1
sources told @entity13 the managers at the @entity18 concocted an elaborate scheme to cover up long wait times there			1
the sources said more than 1,400 veterans were placed on the purported secret list and that documents were shredded to hide the evidence			2
according to sources , at least 40 @entity16 veterans died waiting for care at the facility , many of whom were on the list			1
these issues raised in @entity13 's exclusive investigation have quickly drawn attention in @entity68			2
on monday , president @entity69 said he called on @entity70 to investigate what has happened in @entity44			0
in recent days , numerous members of @entity73 have called for hearings on the @entity18 , and at least three members of @entity73 have publicly called for @entity37 's resignation			1
tears , angry accusations mark hearing on delayed @entity18 care but in an interview with @entity13 on tuesday , @entity37 and her chief of staff , dr. @entity81 , denied any secret effort to cover up or hide wait times			1
" we have never instructed our staff to create a secret list , to maintain a secret list , to shred a secret list -- that has never come from our office as far as instruction to our staff , " said @entity81			2
" it 's never come from me , " added @entity37			2
dr. @entity94 , a 24 - year @entity18 physician and clinic director , recently retired and went public with the details of the list , went on the air publicly for the first time with @entity13 one week ago			1
he denounced @entity37 's claim			2
" they started this secret list in february of 2013 , " @entity94 said			2
" at some time , they changed over from paper to electronic , in early summer , maybe approximately june or july			0
and transferred names over to the electronic waiting list			0
and she [ @entity37 ] was called on an ethics consult evaluation about that -- it 's written down , documented in july			0
" that documentation includes e-mails from july 2013 , which were reported by @entity13 , that show top management , including @entity37 , were well - aware about the actual wait times , knew about the off - the - books list and even defended its use to her staff			1
when directly asked earlier this week about whether evidence of wait times was shredded and whether the secret list existed , @entity118 stated : " i think there is some confusion amongst our staff			2
when we came on as a leadership team in 2012 , the practice at that time was that they would schedule new veterans who would were coming in for care way out into the future			0
sometimes a year , sometimes 14 months			0
and that was the appointment that that veteran was given			0
" as we started to tackle our challenges of access , we implemented a tool that the @entity18 uses nationally called the electronic wait list			1
and what that tool is it 's an electronic waiting list that allows us to everyday look to see who is waiting for an appointment			0
" so what we did is we took those patients that were scheduled way out into the future , and we put them on this national tool that the @entity18 uses so that we could track them			0
what that did is , rather than having an appointment 14 months out into the future , it put them on this @entity156 electronic waiting list , so that when we had an appointment that came open , so if a veteran called next week and canceled their appointment , we could pull a veteran off this list and get them into that slot			0
" so it actually improved the probability of these veterans getting an appointment sooner			0
and in that transition time , i think there was some confusion among staff , i think there were some folks who did not understand that , and i think that 's where these allegations are coming from			0
" january : veterans dying because of health care delays january : @entity73 demands answers november : a dire situation in @entity185			0
