-- on tuesday , citing safety concerns , the @entity1 called for a ban on all cell phone use by drivers			1
it 's the most far - reaching recommendation of its kind to date , and it extends to wireless headsets			1
what will the fallout of the ban be ? it 's likely to cut down on sightings of drivers who appear to be having spirited conversations with their car 's leather interior			1
but might n't it also lead to other similar bans ? so here 's a speculative look at eight of the more questionable and dangerous activities that federal law might see fit to clamp down on			1
skiing or snowboarding while listening to an @entity27			1
in the same way that a preoccupied driver is a menace on the road , so , too , is a hearing - deprived skier or snowboarder a terror on the slopes			2
when an athlete cuts off a source of outside stimuli thusly , he deprives himself of a valuable auditory cue : bloodcurdling screams			2
when people near him scream out " @entity44 ski ! " he thinks they 're simply singing along			2
a federal ban of @entity27 on the slopes would be easy to institute ; its violators would be subject to lift - ticket revocation and reduced hot cocoa			1
applying eyeliner while riding public transportation			1
not only are the practitioners of this activity in danger of impairing their vision , but they are causing undue levels of stress to the people who ca n't stop watching them			2
these public users of beauty products prove yet again that the word " wand , " particularly in close proximity to the word " mascara , " can be as destructive as it is magic			2
a federal statute , perhaps called the @entity69 , would bring relief to millions of commuters			1
lighting an oven by means other than a pilot light			2
though very difficult to enforce without surveillance cameras , a policing of kitchen stove - lighting mechanisms would save many lives , not to mention eyebrows			2
who among us has not turned our stove 's gas on , only to find that the pilot light has blown out , whereupon we wander off to find matches , thus allowing gas to seep into the kitchen ? an overhaul of this fraught activity could result in far fewer instances of fire or explosion			2
and many more evenings where people send out for pizza			0
peering over the balcony of a skyscraper			1
@entity100 , the view , the view			0
the view is ... dangerous			0
it 's a human impulse to get closer to something you 're looking at -- even if that something is the @entity108 skyline			0
modern man has been very creative when it comes to keeping pigeons off of balconies -- witness the shards of glass embedded in concrete , witness plastic owls -- so it 's easy to imagine the government taking a similarly original tack when it comes to repelling humans from peering over precipices			1
am i talking touch - activated sprinklers that gush lukewarm strawberry soda onto overly curious sightseers ? yes , i 'm talking touch - activated sprinklers that gush lukewarm strawberry soda onto overly curious sightseers			0
sticking your head out the roof of a fast - moving limo			0
largely the province of prom - goers and bachelor - partiers , this dangerous activity is of no service to anyone			0
it is interesting only to its participants , much like televised fishing			0
the practice could be easily curbed through a sliding scale of fees , based on duration of head - out - of - window exposure and level of inebriation ; but it might be easier for limo companies simply to buy some glue			0
thanking the doctor who performed open - heart surgery on you by sending her an e-mail that reads , simply , " thx			0
" this unseemly activity is , admittedly , not dangerous , except in the way it devalues human discourse and causes at least one member of a profession necessary to our survival on the planet to question his life 's purpose			0
a " thx " ban could be enforced either through the creation of a @entity171 - like scanning system or a complaints bureau			1
violators would be forced to type what they had previously neglected to type -- " thank you very much " -- 5,000 times a day for two weeks			0
using a paper shredder or fax machine while wearing a necktie			1
the male equivalent to the eyeliner - on - a - moving - vehicle scenario , this imperiling activity is seen daily in offices nationwide			1
yet no one talks about it			0
that we live in a country whose restaurants regularly bear informational posters about the @entity193 maneuver only underscores the casual disregard we have for potential necktie - related mayhem			1
offenders of this ban might be forced to wear their tattered neckties to work , or to do volunteer work at a local @entity201			1
calling someone " honey " if you are not southern or a waitress			0
instant or feigned intimacy is too much for some people to bear , and may result in friction or even violence			0
the issuing of a @entity212 ( do n't you honey me ! ) ticket might do much to cool the fires of sudden or false ardor			0
repeat offenders would be sent to work at large , nameless corporations , or be required to move to @entity219			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity222 .			1

@entity1 has called for a ban on all cell phone use by drivers
@entity222 asks : what other risky activities should federal law clamp down on ?
how about skiing while listening to an @entity27 ? or peering over the balcony of a skyscraper ?
maybe applying eyeliner on a train ? or using a paper shredder while wearing a necktie ?
