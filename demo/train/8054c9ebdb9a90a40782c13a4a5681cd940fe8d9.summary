@entity0 -- new images of @entity5 's main satellite launch site show that an upgrade allowing for larger rockets has been completed , raising the possibility of a fresh launch within the year , a new report says			1
based on satellite images of the @entity12 , located on @entity5 's west coast close to the @entity15 border , the report was posted on the 38 @entity17 website , run by the @entity19 - @entity18 at @entity20			2
" @entity5 is now ready to move forward with another rocket launch , " concluded the report by retired imagery technology expert @entity22 , adding that if the political decision were made to proceed , " a rocket could be launched by the end of 2014			1
" the satellite pictures appeared to show that a yearlong construction project at the @entity12 facility had been completed , including the upgrade of the launch pad and gantry tower to enable the launch of rockets larger than the existing @entity36 space launch vehicle , said the report			1
a @entity39 official , who would not be named in accordance with protocol , said @entity0 was monitoring developments			0
" our military is observing closely all activities regarding the situation of construction and possibility of a missile launch at the @entity50 , " the official said			2
larger rockets ? the @entity19 - @entity18 said the development would allow the @entity12 facility to launch rockets up to 50 meters in length -- considerably larger than the @entity36 , which is about 30 meters long			1
@entity5 last fired an @entity36 in december 2012 , in a controversial launch that successfully put a satellite in orbit			2
while @entity59 insisted the test was for scientific purposes , many nations , including the @entity19 and @entity63 , considered it a cover for testing ballistic missile technology			1
the launch resulted in increased @entity68 sanctions on the diplomatically isolated state			0
the 38 @entity17 report stated that the " most likely candidate " for any potential launch remained the existing @entity36 , since the " much larger rocket , reportedly under development , is at least several years from becoming operational			2
" the satellite images also indicated @entity59 had conducted engine - tests for a road - mobile intercontinental ballistic missile ( @entity79 ) , the @entity80 , it said , which had been ongoing at the site for at least two years			1
" it remains unclear how successful these tests have been			0
however , rocket motor tests are typically conducted prior to full - scale test launches of a missile that precede a weapon becoming operational , " said the report			2
any decision to launch a rocket would ultimately hinge on political considerations , it said			0
is @entity5 still digging tunnels to the @entity63 ? ' long - term commitment ' @entity96 , @entity97 deputy project director at the @entity98 , said the reported activity at @entity12 was consistent with @entity59 's statements regarding space launches			1
" the kim family regime has demonstrated the long - term commitment -- over 30 years -- to develop long - range missiles , " he said			0
" it is important to recognize the relative scale of the investment for an economy the size of the @entity5 's			0
state media and other institutions extol the space program and asserts it is absolutely necessary for the country 's economic development			0
" while any decision by @entity59 to proceed with a launch would take into account domestic and international factors , he said , " in my view , the @entity5 government is fully committed to conducting additional satellite launches , and can not be dissuaded by the international community			1
" the @entity36 did not have military applications , but @entity50 scientists and engineers were able to " apply the know - how they 've acquired from the @entity36 to other missiles , " he said			0
" the @entity5 has continued to develop missiles with the intention of acquiring an icbm , " he said .			0

a new report says @entity5 has completed a major upgrade of its launch *center*
it says the upgrade will allow for larger rockets to be launched
it says @entity59 is continuing testing on a road - mobile intercontinental ballistic missile
*analysts* expect @entity59 to continue with its rockets program despite international *opposition*
