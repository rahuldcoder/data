@entity0 -- duct tape found on @entity4 's skull was placed there after the toddler 's body had decomposed , not before she died , a forensic pathologist testified saturday as the murder trial of the girl 's mother ended its fourth week on a contentious note			1
prosecutors claim @entity4 's mother , @entity4 , used chloroform to make her daughter unconscious then used duct tape to cover her nose and mouth , suffocating her			1
the girl 's skeletal remains were found in a wooded field six months after her family last reported seeing her			2
dr. @entity24 said he believes the tape was placed on the body long after the flesh had disappeared to hold the jaw bone on , perhaps because someone wanted to move it			1
@entity24 also criticized the @entity32 medical examiner , dr. @entity31 , for conducting what he termed a " shoddy autopsy " by failing to cut @entity4 's skull open to look inside			1
@entity24 ' testimony came after chief judge @entity37 ordered the first defense witness off the stand and threatened attorney @entity40 with contempt proceedings for failing to tell prosecutors about the man 's planned testimony			1
forensic anthropologist @entity45 told judge @entity37 after the jury had been excused that he was preparing to testify that no conclusions can be drawn from duct tape found near the girl 's body because of decomposition and movement of the bones by animals			1
@entity45 also said he planned to testify that a video prepared by a prosecution expert superimposing @entity4 's living face with a picture of her skull and the outline of a piece of duct tape was an " unheard of " application of technology meant only to provide initial identifications of remains			1
but @entity45 ' opinions were not contained in his report filed with the court , and were n't shared with prosecutors			0
that violated @entity37 's rule that all expert testimony be shared with opposing attorneys , @entity37 said			2
" it appears to me that this was quite intentional , " @entity37 said to @entity40			0
" this was not some inadvertent slip			0
" he ordered @entity45 off the stand , but said he will be allowed to testify on monday , after prosecutors have a chance to interview him			0
@entity37 said the law would appear to authorize him the right to exclude the testimony , but said that would be too drastic a step			2
" it would be totally unfair to ms. @entity88 to have his testimony excluded on this critical issue , " he said			2
but he said he would be watching @entity40 ' conduct closely and will consider contempt proceedings at the end of the trial			2
" i am not making any promises or warranties about what i will do if it happens a second time with this witness , " @entity37 scolded @entity40			0
@entity45 and @entity24 are part of the defense effort to discredit , among other things , a prosecution theory that duct tape found clinging to the girl 's remains may have been the murder weapon			1
duct tape similar to that found with @entity4 's body was located on a gas can from the @entity115 home that @entity4 took from a storage shed during her daughter 's disappearance , according to earlier testimony in the case			1
@entity24 began his testimony challenging the thoroughness of the autopsy performed on @entity115 , saying examining the inside of the skull is standard practice			1
he testified that dried sediment he found indicated the body had decomposed on its left side , with the face pointing slightly up			0
that differs from evidence at the scene indicating the skull was upright when it was discovered			0
@entity24 said the lack of @entity136 found on the tape would suggest it was placed on the girl 's skull by someone who wanted to move it for some reason			1
the tape , he said , was intended to keep the jawbone from falling off			2
on cross-examination , prosecutor @entity145 asked @entity24 if the sediment was not " brain dust " but perhaps something that carried into the skull by water while the body lay under water in the flood - prone spot where it was found			2
@entity24 responded that the fact that the material was residue from the girl 's body was as plain as the jawbone on the replica skull he was using as an illustration during his testimony			1
but he acknowledged that the material had not been chemically proven to be from the girl 's body			2
@entity145 also questioned @entity24 ' characterization of @entity31 's autopsy			1
he challenged the physician -- who co-wrote a book on forensic investigations -- to cite any specific protocol requiring that a pathologist saw open the skull of a thoroughly decomposed body -- including in his own book			0
@entity24 said that he could not , but that his long experience and training tells him that failing to look at the inside of body 's skull is poor practice			1
" the skull , the head , is part of the body , and when you do an autopsy you examine the whole body , " he said			0
defense attorneys claim @entity4 was not murdered , but that she accidentally drowned in the family pool on june 16 , the day she was last seen			1
they argue that @entity115 and her father , @entity115 , panicked and covered up the death			0
@entity115 has rejected that scenario in his testimony			0
@entity4 is charged with seven counts , including first degree murder , in the death of her daughter , whose remains were discovered in a wooded field in december 2008 , six months after her last family saw her			1
saturday was the third day of the defense case			0
the case will enter its fifth week monday			0
