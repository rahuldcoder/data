we 've been growing for 20 to 30 % per annum compounded for the last seven years			1

the first one is infrastructure			0
airport infrastructure or aviation infrastructure in the continent			0
it is not as well developed as the rest of the world so much work is needed there			0
we 're working with @entity13 governments to improve on that			0
the second one is brain drain from @entity13 to the developed world			0
and particular to the @entity153 , and so this has been a problem for most @entity13 carriers			0
i think for all of us			0
but going forward we are building a huge aviation academy , the capacity has grown from 150 graduates to 1000 graduates a year			0
