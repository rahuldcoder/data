@entity0 -- a controversial and leading @entity3 general is in line to oversee the wars in @entity6 and @entity7 , according to @entity3 defense secretary @entity8			1
@entity10 gen. @entity9 -- if he wins presidential and @entity13 approval -- will move from being the outgoing commander of @entity15 to leading the @entity16 , which oversees @entity3 military operations in the @entity18 and @entity19 , including @entity7 , @entity20 and @entity6			1
the command also monitors @entity22			2
he would take over the post left open by the departure of gen. @entity26 , who was asked to take over command of the war in @entity7			2
@entity9 was an effective leader in the @entity10 , in the eyes of the @entity30 , while commanding troops in @entity6 and @entity7			1
known for his straight talk and hard - core leadership of @entity10 in the 2004 battle of @entity35 , @entity6 , @entity9 is considered a dark - horse pick by many in the halls of the @entity30			1
his blunt talk has gotten him in trouble : in 2005 he said , " it 's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them , " referring to @entity7 fighters			1
asked if the general would be an effective leader for the @entity16 region with the shadow of the comments still lingering , @entity8 said thursday , " appropriate action was taken at the time			1
i think that the subsequent five years have demonstrated that the lesson was learned			2
" " obviously , in the wake of the @entity55 interview , we discussed this kind of thing			2
and i have every confidence that @entity59 will respond to questions and speak publicly about the matters for which he is responsible in an entirely appropriate way , " @entity8 said			2
the @entity55 interview led to the resignation of gen. @entity64 , then the commander in @entity7 , because of negative comments about @entity67 administration officials made by him and his aides			2
@entity9 ' comment in 2005 was made when the then - three - star general was in a panel discussion before an audience			1
" actually , it 's quite fun to fight them , you know			0
it 's a hell of a hoot , " he said , prompting laughter from some military members in the audience			0
" it 's fun to shoot some people			0
i 'll be right up there with you			0
i like brawling , " he said			0
" you go into @entity7 , you got guys who slap women around for five years because they did n't wear a veil , " he said			0
" you know , guys like that ai n't got no manhood left anyway			0
so it 's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them			0
" the commandant of the @entity10 at the time , gen. @entity99 , counseled @entity9 about the remarks but defended him publicly , calling him " one of this country 's bravest and most experienced military leaders			1
" " while i understand that some people may take issue with the comments made by him , i also know he intended to reflect the unfortunate and harsh realities of war , " he said in a written statement			0
" lt. gen. @entity9 often speaks with a great deal of candor			1
" @entity9 also was the commanding general overseeing the case of the now - infamous slayings of civilians by @entity10 in @entity117 , @entity6			1
some 24 civilians were killed on november 19 , 2005 , in what a human rights group and military prosecutors said was a house - to - house rampage by @entity10 after a roadside bomb killed one of their comrades			0
eight @entity10 were charged , and all but one were cleared , some of them by @entity9			1
@entity9 also was the overseeing authority in the murder case involving eight @entity10 found guilty of taking part in a plot to drag an @entity134 man from his home , kill him and then make it look like the man was an insurgent			1
that incident occurred near the western @entity134 town of @entity141 in april 2006			0
@entity9 later cut the sentences of at least two of the @entity10 involved in the plot			1
@entity9 had been preparing to retire after finishing his latest command , @entity8 said			2
" @entity59 is one of our military 's outstanding combat leaders and strategic thinkers , bringing an essential mix of experience , judgment and perspective to this important post , " @entity8 said			0
" @entity59 has proven to be one of the military 's most innovative and iconoclastic thinkers			0
his insights into the nature of warfare in the 21st century have influenced my own views about how the armed forces must be shaped and postured for the future			0
