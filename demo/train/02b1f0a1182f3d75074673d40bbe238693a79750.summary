-- after eight months in hibernation , @entity9 's " lost " returns to television tonight to finally explain , among other things , the dazzling white light that ended the 2009 season not with a whimper , but with a bang			1
was it a nuclear blast ? a quantum - leaping time shift ? a reboot to the story 's preflight origins ? these are key questions as broadcast tv 's most ambitiously complex drama series presents @entity19 -- the first of 16 final - season episodes before ending its time - rearranging , sympathy - shifting narrative			1
but the most important question of all , six years after " lost " was launched in 2004 , is this : who cares ? that 's not a flippant question , because both tv and the audience have changed in the years since " lost " pulled back from @entity31 's eyeball to reveal , slowly and masterfully , the panicked insanity of a remote island plane crash			1
little more than a decade ago , " lost " would have been riveting " appointment television , " but dvrs and dvd boxed sets have changed the rules of the game			2
instead of clearing calendars to watch in real time and line up for the water - cooler conversation the next morning , fans of such shows as " lost " and @entity42 's similarly serialized " 24 " might just as easily record and time - shift their viewing , avoiding office chats until they watched on their own schedules			2
or , even more aggressively , they might actively avoid the broadcasts of their favorite show , just for the delayed gratification of watching the entire season later on dvd -- gobbling up episodes at their own pace , and without commercials			0
it 's a very different tv world than in 1967 , when the long - awaited ending of @entity9 's " @entity62 , " with @entity63 's @entity62 finally coming face - to - face with his wife 's one - armed killer , drew enough viewers to set a tv record for entertainment programming that beat even @entity67 on " the @entity68 " three years earlier			1
or in 1983 , when the finale of @entity71 ' " @entity70 , " with its end to the @entity73 , drew 77 percent of all tv viewers that night , and set a viewership record of 121.6 million that still stands			0
and , given the fragmentation of tv audiences , most likely will never be equaled			0
" @entity24 , " at its viewer zenith in season two , boasted an average of nearly 19 million viewers			2
by last season , that number was below 12 million			0
and the season finale -- the episode that , in a reverse - polarity nod to the abrupt blackout ending to @entity89 's " @entity88 , " concluded with an unsettling fade to white -- attracted about 10 million viewers			2
in the interim , the broadcast networks attempted to copy the " lost " formula of season - long mysteries and unanswered questions , but all the attempts ( " @entity98 " from @entity71 , " invasion " from @entity9 , etc. ) came up short , and vanished without concluding			1
" lost , " at least , is marching towards an actual ending -- and that alone makes it a tv event worth embracing			0
ireporter : " @entity24 " lives up to expectations after all , how many more opportunities like this will viewers get ? on cable tv , perhaps many			2
but on broadcast tv , how many shows are left that are even worth caring about -- much less anticipating their conclusion ? it 's likely that many viewers who gave up on " lost " in years past will return for this final lap , hoping to witness something special			1
the creators and show runners of this labyrinthine drama series have known for years what the final image will be ( my guess , and my hope : an extreme closeup of @entity31 's eye , ending the show just as it began ) , and are crafting this final season with an eye ( so to speak ) to the show 's beginnings , as well as its endings			1
despite all the changes in technology and viewership , " @entity24 " is a series that rewards , if not demands , watching in real time			0
@entity9 did n't even provide critics with preview copies of the final - season premiere -- and even though i 'm therefore deprived , i 'm not complaining			1
this is a show i want to watch as it airs , and discuss with friends afterward			0
i do n't take for granted how rare that is these days -- and neither should you			0
