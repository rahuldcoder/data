-- @entity1 is headed to the big screen			0
the girl with the flaming curls ( and not - so - flattering nickname ) from " @entity6 " will soon be getting the cinematic treatment , with @entity8 picking up film rights to @entity11 's best - selling novel			1
" every girl who has read it says , ' that was me in high school , or that was me in seventh grade , ' " @entity12 , @entity8 president of production , tells @entity0			1
" it reminded all of us of our own sort of awkwardness , or family dysfunction			0
" the studio was drawn to the teenage love story for the same reason as its legions of fans			1
" it 's not the typical story where the ugly duckling is in love with the hot guy , " @entity12 says			1
" they 're both trying to find their way			0
" the best summer blockbusters ever set in 1986 , and following one school year in @entity38 , the novel follows the tentative romance of two 16 - year - olds : @entity41 , a somewhat heavy girl overwhelmed by insecurities and trying to survive an abusive household , and @entity45 , the quiet , half - @entity47 kid who also does n't feel like he fits in but finds refuge in music and comic books			1
after its publication in february 2013 , the book spent 12 weeks on the @entity54 bestseller list , and has inspired a passionate , devoted following			0
" the book is uniquely structured in that one chapter is told by @entity41 and one chapter is told from @entity45 's perspective , and they alternate , " @entity12 points out			2
" so we 're trying to figure out how to do that in a movie			2
there are all sorts of groovy stylistic things you could do with voice over , or words on the screen , but we want something that 's real @entity72			2
" @entity73 and @entity74 to appear in ' @entity75 ' with that in mind , @entity11 -- who is repped by @entity76 â € ” has also been hired to write the screenplay			1
" she 's in the middle of writing another book , so we 're patiently waiting for her , " @entity12 said			2
already on board the project are producer @entity84 , who as a studio executive oversaw " @entity86 " and " @entity88 , " and executive producer @entity87 ( the upcoming " predestination			0
" ) once the script is in , a director and cast will be attached			0
@entity8 hopes to start shooting in 2015			1
but fans do n't need to wait for that ... who would you cast in the two main roles ? better to go with unknowns , or find a pair of young actors already on the rise ? see the original story at @entity0			0
