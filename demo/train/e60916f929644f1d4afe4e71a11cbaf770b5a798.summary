-- despite previous statements that he had no plans to see " @entity7 , " @entity3 founder and ceo @entity2 did , in fact , watch the film on the company 's field trip to the movies last friday			1
i just wrapped up an interview with @entity3 's iconic founder and groups product manager @entity15 at the company 's headquarters in @entity18 , @entity19			2
we discussed the new groups feature and data portability , but i did also manage to sneak in a question or two about the film , specifically about @entity2 's take on it			0
while @entity2 skirted questions about his opinion of @entity30 's portrayal of his early years , the 26 - year - old ceo did say he 's interested to see what effect " @entity7 " has on entrepreneurship			1
he told me that he gets " lots of messages " from people who claim that they have been very much inspired by what he 's done ; some say he 's inspired them to go into computer science , others to start their own company			0
i could n't get him to rate the film for me , but i did get him to talk about what effect he thought it would have on the company he 's built			2
he 's been asked a lot of questions about what exactly happened during @entity3 's early years , he said in our interview			0
however , he added , " we build products that 500 million people see ... if 5 million people see a movie , it does n't really matter that much			1
" in other words , the movie is a drop in the bucket compared to @entity3 's bigger ambitions to make the entire world more social			2
it seems like he 's stopped worrying about the potential impact of the movie on @entity3 's image and is focused on building and launching new products			0
we 've said all along that @entity2 should like the @entity3 movie			1
i do n't think you 'll see him promoting it for an @entity68 anytime soon , but it does n't seem like he fears it anymore , either			0

@entity3 founder @entity2 watched " @entity7 " on a company field trip
" if 5 million people see a movie , it does n't really matter that much , " @entity2 said
