-- @entity2 's new @entity1 will have the financial backing of @entity5 co-founder @entity4 -- and the video sharing web site 's chief executive expects to make a big impact in motorsport			1
@entity4 is hoping his start - up experience can help the @entity1 team become a major player			1
the @entity13 , who along with co-founders @entity14 and @entity16 sold @entity5 to internet giant @entity18 for $ 1.65 billion in 2006 , has faith in the team 's prospects for the 2010 season			1
it is fronted by engineer @entity24 , formerly involved with @entity26 team @entity25 , and @entity27 , a journalist who has worked with @entity1 's @entity29 and @entity30			2
" i believe in @entity24 and @entity27 and the team that they have put together , and i believe that we have a chance to hopefully start from a clean slate and try to build a team in a different way , " @entity4 told web site @entity32			1
@entity4 started @entity5 from scratch , and sees parallels with his involvement with @entity1			1
" the business aspect of what attracted me to @entity1 is just that , that it is a start - up , " he said			2
" and it 's a very similar situation to one that would be in @entity48			0
" it 's a small team of talented , smart individuals trying to break the mould , trying to accomplish something that others think is impossible			2
" however , @entity4 does not expect instant success for the new franchise , which will be the only @entity2 outfit based outside of @entity57 and comes into the sport in difficult economic times when sponsors are dropping out			1
" obviously we want to be competitive , " he told @entity32			0
" i know there is going to be a lot of competition -- it 's going to take quite a few years to ramp up this team and get the cars into a position where we are competing for the world championship , but ultimately that 's our goal			0
" we 're not necessarily going to get involved and be satisfied with just getting a car onto the track			0
our aspirations and goals go much farther than that			0
" while major manufacturers have been reviewing their participation in motorsport 's premium category -- @entity81 withdrew at the end of last year and @entity83 will end its association with @entity85 at the end of this season -- @entity4 is confident that he can find other investors to back the @entity13 team			1
" i hope so , and i hope it goes beyond @entity48 , " he said			0
" i am definitely going to be involved in helping the team with sponsors , helping the team with business relationships , and helping the team with integrating technology -- ways that they can leverage and benefit from social media and the internet broadly			0
" so in many ways , i hope to add benefit to the team and what they are trying to accomplish			0
