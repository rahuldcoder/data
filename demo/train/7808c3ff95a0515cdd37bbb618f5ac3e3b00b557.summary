@entity0 , @entity1 -- making it to the top as a prima ballerina takes a lot of work , strength and time -- and , says , @entity10 , " a lot of emotions			1
" the 33 - year - old @entity1 has been prima ballerina , or principal dancer , with @entity0 's prestigious @entity16 theatre company for nearly a decade and her presence on a cast list is guaranteed to fill any theatre in @entity20 , @entity21 or @entity22			1
@entity10 's grace and stage presence belie her difficult , and sometimes lonely , journey to the top			1
born in the historic , north - western city of @entity29 in @entity31 - era @entity30 , @entity10 's mother sent her away to train at the age of 10 -- first to @entity33 , then at @entity35 's esteemed @entity34			1
" it took me a few years to get used to the ballet , " she said			1
" my child 's body was not ready to handle such loads , and the legs that were used to walk upright had to be twisted and the back always had to be held straight			2
it was a huge strain and i did not have the strength			2
" it was an unhappy period in the young @entity10 's life			1
she says that she would find herself crying " all the time " between the conveyor belt of exams and rehearsals			2
more from @entity51 : molecular gastronomy chef @entity52 only when , as a teenager , her body grew tall , strong and athletic did she begin to see how her future might pan out			0
" when i was about 13 or 14 ... i really realized that i wanted to become a ballerina , " she said			1
from then on she practiced everyday , often for up to eight hours solid			1
she says she did n't miss out on the usual freedoms of childhood : " i can not say that it was a sacrifice , " she said			2
" i do not even think about it			0
" revealingly , she would n't wish the same experience for her own daughter , who was born in february 2011			0
" i can not imagine myself giving her away to study in a different town , " she said			0
" i asked my mum , ' why ? how did it happen ? ' and she said , ' you know , even until now i can not understand what i was led by -- it must have been something from above			0
' " @entity10 graduated from @entity73 in 1996 , aged 17 , and immediately joined the @entity74 -- one of @entity1 's preeminent ballet companies -- and a year later was promoted to principal dancer			1
in the seven seasons that followed , she learned the bulk of the company 's repertory , including the great classical roles of @entity83 , @entity84 in " @entity85 " and @entity86 in " @entity87			0
" more from @entity51 : former piano prodigy @entity88 despite growing national acclaim -- she was awarded one of @entity1 's highest artistic accolades , the @entity93 , for two consecutive years at the turn of the millennium -- she was getting itchy feet			1
" i worked in the @entity96 for seven years , and i danced the whole classic repertoire there , and the contemporary repertoire , " she says			0
" but all of a sudden i started to realize that i was not developing any more			0
day in , day out it was the same and the same -- and suddenly i wanted to change something			0
" that change came in a dramatic move to @entity105 's main rival , the @entity16 ballet company in @entity0 , known for it 's " grander , more expansive style , " according to @entity110 's @entity109 newspaper			2
@entity10 has n't looked back since			1
with the @entity16 she has traveled the globe and in 2007 she was awarded the @entity112 for outstanding achievement in ballet			2
next year she is scheduled to perform at @entity117 's renowned @entity116 opera house , where she will dance @entity83			0
success , though , has not eradicated a persistent grain of self - doubt			0
even now , as she enters her 15th year as a professional dancer , @entity10 still regards herself , for the most part , as a student			1
" when i 'm in rehearsal i always feel like i 'm a pupil -- and not at all a ballerina " she reveals			2
indeed , it 's only in those comparatively brief moments on stage that @entity10 says she truly believes in herself as a performer			1
" this transformation is unique , " she explains			0
" something from within takes place and you understand sometimes that human abilities are limitless			0
during the performance you do such things which you completely did not expect from yourself			0
" whatever it is that envelops her on stage , the feeling is addictive			0
@entity141 has been dancing almost everyday since the age six and now finds it hard to imagine what the future will hold when , one day , she will have to hang up her ballet shoes for good			1
" @entity74 is not just my profession , it is my life ... it is horrible for me to think that one day it will all finish			1
" @entity152 contributed to this story			0
