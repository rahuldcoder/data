-- how do you get someone to buy a ticket for a cancer show ? pretend it 's a comedy of course			0
hey , it worked with " @entity8 ! " anyhow that seems to be the marketing strategy for " 50/50 , " a sympathetic and yes , sometimes , humorous drama about a young man diagnosed with a rare form of the disease that 's nowhere near as crass as the trailer would have you believe			1
of course the combination of crass and @entity17 is a proven winner , so you ca n't blame them for trying			2
he plays the crude , beer - swilling , girlfriend - hating best buddy supporting role , but even this off - the - peg character has more going for him than usual			0
he may be boorish , especially around women , but @entity29 genuinely wants what 's best for @entity31 ( @entity32 )			1
learning that his pal 's chances of coming through this are 50/50 , he immediately takes heart : " if you were a casino game you 'd have the best odds			2
" a more resourceful actor than he used to be , @entity17 shows us someone who is actively trying to grow up even if he 's not too sure what that might entail			1
it 's a delicate portrait of a clumsy man			0
as you would expect , most of the dramatic heavy lifting falls on @entity32 , and he responds smartly by underplaying , muting his responses , looking for stillness and calm -- or what his trainee therapist ( @entity52 ) recognizes as numb denial			2
when that composure does break , @entity32 hits you hard with @entity31 's anger and fear			1
admittedly the movie does n't have the stomach for the gaunt physical enfeeblement you see in most serious cancer cases -- and occasionally in rare , brave films like " @entity65			0
" @entity31 shaves his head and admits to some weariness , but that 's about as far down that depressing road director @entity69 wants to take us			1
it 's a movie , not a documentary			0
based on an autobiographical screenplay by @entity75 ( a friend of @entity17 who apparently went through the same diagnosis ) , " 50/50 " generally avoids the terminal whimsy that swamps @entity79 's current arty atrocity , " @entity89 " in favor of practical real - life concerns like getting to and from the hospital , eating and allowing your loved ones their share of the suffering ( @entity86 more or less steals the movie with a knockout turn as a difficult and overbearing but still caring mom )			1
on this evidence , hanging out for chemo with the guys is almost like poker night -- until one player cashes in his chips for good			0
but the mordant camaraderie @entity31 strikes up with his much older fellow patients ( @entity98 and @entity99 ) rings true , actually			2
@entity52 ( from " @entity100 " ) works hard to make her novice psychologist believable -- a tall order in the circumstances but she carries it off well enough -- while @entity104 bravely follows " @entity105 " with another chilly narcissist , @entity31 's girlfriend @entity107			1
the plotting is n't exactly unpredictable , but when it comes to juggling comedy and pathos , " 50/50 " gets the balance just about right			0
it 's no cure for cancer , but when we 're dealing with such a painful topic it sure does n't hurt to laugh -- or cry -- and know you 're in good company .			0
