-- @entity1 blew @entity2 away with a strong display in the field , wrapping up a 113 - run victory over the hosts on the final day of the first test in @entity8			1
@entity11 gave @entity1 early breakthroughs in the morning , @entity9 and @entity10 chipped in with vital wickets and @entity14 completed a four - wicket haul as @entity1 cantered to victory with a session to spare			2
@entity18 delayed the end with a stroke - filled 101 after opener @entity21 bolstered the innings with 52 , but the home side -- 67 for two at the start of play -- were bowled out for 301			1
a diligent approach was required of the home side if they were to save the game , but instead their batsmen played into @entity1 's hands with an aggressive approach			2
but that attacking intent was nipped in the bud when batsman @entity36 attempted to drive @entity11 on the up , only for an edge to be neatly snapped up by @entity39 at second slip			0
victory for @entity1 then seemed a foregone conclusion when @entity43 , who suffered a painful rap on the elbow , was trapped in front by @entity11 with a delivery that nipped in			0
@entity21 helped @entity2 recover somewhat from those early blows , the opener hammering a wayward @entity49 for two boundaries in one over and reaching his third test half - century with a reverse sweep of @entity14			1
but @entity9 brought himself on just before the lunch interval and struck in his second over , luring @entity21 into a wild slash and inducing the edge , @entity39 completing the dismissal with a sharp catch at slip			0
@entity61 was @entity14 's first victim of the day and @entity62 went shortly after , losing out to @entity10			0
@entity63 and @entity18 held up the end with a 60 - run stand for the eighth wicket , but @entity14 ended that stand , boring through @entity63 's defensives and bowling him through the gate			1
@entity14 should have had another wicket but @entity70 dropped a simple catch from @entity72 , extending the tailenders stay			0
but that reprieve hardly proved costly as @entity14 held a low return catch from @entity72 in the next over to send back the batsman			0
the home side had slipped to 258 for nine by then and the session was extended and the tea interval delayed			0
with an attacking field in place , runs were there for the taking and @entity18 cashed in , reaching his maiden century with a straight - driven boundary off @entity14 , his 17th boundary			1
he had already smashed a six by then and had reached the milestone off only 112 deliveries , the fastest - ever century by a @entity2 batsman			1
@entity14 , however , brought up victory by prising out @entity18 , the wicketkeeper - batsman lofting the bowler over the top , but only finding the fielder at long - off .			2
