@entity0 , @entity1 -- through hours of outbursts and objections in military court , @entity3 said he had one image in his mind : that of a plane smashing into the @entity11 tower where his sister worked			1
@entity14 surged inside him , @entity3 told reporters sunday , a day after he sat among a group of victim family members who watched the arraignment of accused 9/11 mastermind @entity19 and four others at @entity0 , the @entity21 naval base where the men are being tried before a military court			1
" just listening to that rhetoric , how they perceive themselves -- it 's hurtful , because they have no remorse			1
i do n't think they even have any souls , " he said			2
@entity3 's sister , @entity32 , worked as a secretary on the 105th floor of the south tower of the @entity11			1
she was one of the nearly 3,000 people killed when the towers were brought down by hijacked jetliners on september 11 , 2001			1
outside the courtroom sunday , @entity3 read a statement he said was a message for @entity19 and the other men			1
" i came a long way to see you , eye to eye			2
... if you would have this in another country , it would be a different story			2
they would have given you your wish to meet your maker quicker than you would realize			2
but this is @entity21 , and you deserve a fair and just trial , according to our @entity58 , not yours			1
that 's what separates us @entity21 from you and your ideology , " he said			1
but still , he told reporters , hearing the defendants and their attorneys criticize the proceedings was difficult			1
" they 're complaining , and our families ca n't complain no more			0
... i would n't care if they were on a bed of nails			0
... but it 's our justice system , and they have rights , " he said			1
earlier sunday , an attorney representing one of the defendants said prolonged silence and occasional outbursts during their arraignment were signs of " peaceful resistance to an unjust system			1
" " these men have endured years of inhumane treatment and torture , " @entity91 , who is representing defendant @entity92 , told reporters at @entity0			1
gen. @entity98 , the chief prosecutor in the case , declined to discuss the defendants ' behaviors but said the military trial process is just and impartial			1
" you all saw them			0
i saw a process that was moving forward methodically , " he told reporters sunday			1
the attorneys ' comments came after a 13 - hour court session on saturday -- the first appearance in a military courtroom for @entity19 and four others since charges were re-filed against them in connection with the attacks			1
the hearing , which wrapped just before 10:30 p.m. , offered a rare glimpse of the five men who have not been seen publicly since january 2009 , when they were first charged by a military tribunal			2
@entity19 , @entity92 and the others -- @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 -- appeared to work together to defy the judge 's instructions , refusing to speak or cooperate with courtroom protocol			1
on sunday , attorneys representing them told reporters that the proceedings had been unfair to their clients			0
they criticized restrictions that they said prevented them from discussing topics like torture			2
" we are hamstrung ... before we ever start , " said @entity138 , who is representing @entity19			1
" the system is a rigged game to prevent us from doing our jobs			0
" @entity98 said he strongly disagreed with that assessment			0
" they can talk to their clients about anything , " he said			0
on saturday , silence from the defendants -- some of whom ignored the judge , while others appeared to be reading -- slowed the proceedings to a crawl			2
@entity154 was wheeled into the courtroom in a restraining chair			0
it was unclear why he was the only defendant brought into court in that manner , though he was allowed out of restraints after he promised not to disrupt court proceedings			2
toward the end of the day , he took off his shirt while his attorney was describing injuries she alleged he sustained while in custody			2
the judge told @entity125 , " no ! " and warned that he would be removed from the courtroom if he did not follow directions			0
at one point , bin ' @entity125 made a paper airplane and placed it on top of a microphone			0
it was removed after a translator complained about the sound the paper made against the microphone			0
hours into saturday 's proceeding , one of the defendants broke his silence with an outburst			1
@entity126 shouted in heavily accented @entity184 : " you may not see us anymore , " he said			0
" they are going to kill us			0
" during recesses , the five men talked amongst each other and appeared relaxed			0
they passed around a copy of @entity192			0
@entity126 appeared to lead the group twice in prayer in the courtroom , once delaying the resumption of the hearing			0
@entity19 , whose long beard appeared to be dyed red by henna , was much thinner than the last time he was seen publicly in a courtroom			1
the judge , col. @entity201 , needed the five to vocally confirm their desire to be represented by the attorneys who accompanied them to court			0
because the defendants refused to cooperate , @entity201 ruled the men would continue to be represented by their current military and civilian attorneys			1
all five men are charged with terrorism , hijacking aircraft , conspiracy , murder in violation of the law of war , attacking civilians , attacking civilian objects , intentionally causing serious bodily injury and destruction of property in violation of the law of war			0
if convicted , they face the death penalty			0
there were so many allegations behind the charges , it took more than two hours for officers of the court just to read into the record the details of the 9/11 hijackings			1
the reading of the charges " provided a stirring reminder of the importance of the case , " @entity98 said sunday			0
" for so many people involved in this trial , the pursuit of justice is worth every moment spent , " he said			2
the next hearing is scheduled for june 12			0
it will likely be at least a year before the case goes to trial , @entity201 said			2
the charges allege that the five are " responsible for the planning and execution of the attacks of sept. 11 , 2001 , in @entity257 , @entity258 , and @entity259 , @entity260 , resulting in the killing of 2,976 people , " the @entity251 said			2
though @entity19 confessed to organizing the september 11 attacks on @entity257 and @entity258 , his confession could be called into question during a trial			1
a 2005 @entity268 memo -- released by the @entity270 administration -- revealed he had been waterboarded 183 times in march 2003			0
the technique , which simulates drowning , has been called torture by president @entity270 and others			2
the military initially charged @entity19 in 2008 , but @entity270 stopped the case as part of his effort to close the @entity21 detention center at @entity0			1
unable to close the center , @entity270 attempted to move the case to federal court in @entity257 in 2009 , only to run into a political firestorm			0
the plan was dropped after complaints about cost and security , and attorney general @entity289 announced in april 2011 that the five would face a military trial at @entity0			1
the decision was met with some criticism , including from the @entity294			0
@entity294 executive director @entity295 said last month that the administration is making a " terrible mistake by prosecuting the most important terrorism trials of our time in a second - tier system of justice			0

a 9/11 victim 's *brother* says the arraignment " brought up all the old memories " of the attacks
the chief prosecutor says the military trial process is just and impartial
an attorney says the defendants " have endured years of inhumane treatment and torture "
@entity19 and others drag out arraignment for 13 hours
