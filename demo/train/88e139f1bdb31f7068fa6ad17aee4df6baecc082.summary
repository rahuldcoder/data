-- the sole set of criminal charges to come from the fake classes scandal at the @entity4 might soon be dropped			1
@entity6 district attorney @entity5 told @entity0 that he 's thinking about withdrawing fraud charges against @entity9 professor @entity8			1
@entity8 was indicted in december after a grand jury found he was paid to teach so - called paper classes , which did n't require students to attend but instead just write a single paper			1
the scandal has drawn national attention since the @entity16 has declined to punish the university , even though many of the classes were attended by athletes			0
whistleblower and former reading specialist @entity22 , along with former athletes , have also publicly said there was systematic cheating in the classes and that the @entity27 used the paper classes to keep athletes eligible when they would have otherwise failed			1
but @entity4 has continuously denied that any administrators , except for @entity30 and his assistant , were aware of what was happening			0
@entity5 said his decision was based on great cooperation from @entity36 in the criminal investigation and the latest @entity4 - commissioned inquiry , this one being conducted by former homeland security adviser @entity39			1
@entity5 said he thinks it is better for the community to have @entity8 's cooperation -- to understand why , how and when the paper classes began and who had knowledge of them -- than to have a criminal prosecution move forward			1
in either case , @entity5 said , @entity8 is likely eligible for a diversionary program that would eventually lead to the charges being dismissed			1
" even though it 's a noncriminal investigation , that is more important than this , " @entity5 said , referring to @entity39 's review			2
" the money is paid back already , " @entity5 said			0
" this was more of an academic scandal than any kind of criminal issue			0
... in the criminal probe , what we 're left with is one low - level nonviolent felony for a person never in trouble before in his life			0
" that said , nothing has been decided			0
@entity5 is simply considering it			0
neither @entity8 or his attorney responded to @entity0 's requests for comment			2
last week , during a @entity4 board meeting , @entity39 gave an update , and referenced the cooperation from both @entity36 and his assistant , @entity76			2
@entity5 announced he declined to charge @entity76 when she began cooperating			0
@entity39 told the board that his team had been briefed by the criminal investigators and that @entity76 and @entity8 were interviewed , " thanks in large part to the efforts and assistance of @entity6 district attorney @entity84 " @entity39 also said that his team has collected and searched 1.5 million e-mails and documents from more than 30 people , including faculty , athletic administrators at @entity4			1
they are also analyzing student transcripts going back to the 1980s and have gotten " extremely valuable " information from people who have reached out			0
@entity5 said he believes @entity8 's cooperation is imperative			1
" it may be impossible to get to the bottom because this was going on for years and years , but the only opportunity to get a full picture -- they had to interview @entity8 , and he was willing to do that			0
" @entity22 said that there are several administrators in academics and athletics who openly talked about the paper classes and about putting athletes into the classes when they needed a boost to their grade point average .			2
