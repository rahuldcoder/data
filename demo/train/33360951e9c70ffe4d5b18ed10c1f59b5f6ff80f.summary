the federal government has concluded there 's a new leaker exposing national security documents in the aftermath of surveillance disclosures by former @entity10 contractor @entity8 , @entity1 officials tell @entity11			1
proof of the newest leak comes from national security documents that formed the basis of a news story published tuesday by the intercept , the news site launched by @entity18 , who also published @entity8 's leaks			1
@entity10 leaker @entity8 asks to extend @entity20 asylum the intercept article focuses on the growth in @entity1 government databases of known or suspected terrorist names during the @entity27 administration			1
the article cites documents prepared by the @entity29 dated august 2013 , which is after @entity8 left the @entity1 to avoid criminal charges			1
@entity18 has suggested there was another leaker			1
in july , he said on @entity33 " it seems clear at this point " that there was another			0
government officials have been investigating to find out that identity			0
in a february interview with @entity11 's @entity40 , @entity18 said : " i definitely think it 's fair to say that there are people who have been inspired by @entity8 's courage and by the great good and virtue that it has achieved			1
" he added , " i have no doubt there will be other sources inside the government who see extreme wrongdoing who are inspired by @entity8			1
" it 's not yet clear how many documents the new leaker has shared and how much damage it may cause			2
so far , the documents shared by the new leaker are labeled " @entity59 " and " @entity60 , " which means it is n't to be shared with foreign government			2
that 's a lower level of classification than most of the documents leaked by @entity8			1
government officials say he stole 1.7 million classified documents , many of which were labeled " @entity59 , " a higher classification for the government 's most important secrets			2
big databases the biggest database , called the @entity75 , now has 1 million names , a @entity1 official confirmed to @entity11			1
that 's boosted from half that many in the aftermath of the botched attempt by the so - called underwear bomber to blow up a @entity1 - bound jetliner on christmas day in 2009			0
the growth of @entity75 , and other more specialized terrorist databases and watchlists , was a result of vulnerabilities exposed in the 2009 underwear plot , government officials said			1
a year after @entity8 the underwear bomber , @entity92 , was not on government watchlists that would have prevented him from being allowed to fly to the @entity1			1
in 2012 , the @entity29 reported that the @entity75 database contained 875,000 names			2
there were about 500,000 in 2009 before the underwear bomb plot			0
the @entity98 first reported the new tide database numbers , along with details of other databases			2
the intercept article as of november , 2013 , there were 700,000 people listed in the @entity105 ( @entity105 ) , or the " @entity106 , according to a @entity1 official			2
fewer than 1 % are @entity1 persons and fewer than 0.5 % are @entity1 citizens			0
the list has grown somewhat since that time , but is nowhere near the 1.5 million figure cited in recent news reports			2
current numbers for the @entity105 can not be released at this time			0
the @entity98 report said , citing the documents , that 40 % on the " @entity106 " are n't affiliated with terror groups			1
@entity1 officials familiar with the matter say the claim is incorrect based on a misreading of the documents			0
@entity1 on lists the report said that as of august , 2013 , 5,000 @entity1 were on the @entity105 watchlist			0
another 15,800 were on the wider tide list			0
a smaller subset , 16,000 names , including 1,200 belonging to @entity1 , are listed as " selectees " who are subject to more intensive screening at airports and border crossings			0
according to the intercept , citing the documents , the cities with the most names on the list are : @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 ; @entity141 ; @entity142 ; and @entity143			1
@entity139 is home to one the nation 's biggest concentrations of @entity147 and @entity148 populations			0
according to the documents cited by the intercept , the government has also begun a new effort to collect information and biometric data on @entity1 persons in the aftermath of the 2013 @entity158 bombings			1
the data includes photos from driver 's licenses			0
that effort likely was spurred by the fact that @entity165 agents investigating the @entity167 bombings found existing databases lacking when they tried to match images of the two bombers isolated from surveillance video , according to @entity1 officials familiar with the matter			0
stored on @entity175 system documents classified as " @entity59 " are stored on a @entity175 - operated computer system called @entity178 , which the @entity180 departments use to share classified information			0
a recent @entity183 study found that between 2006 - 2011 there were 3.2 million approved by the @entity175 to handle secret , top secret , @entity186 ( sensitive compartmented ) information			0
@entity178 is one of the computer systems that the former @entity191 soldier now known as @entity192 accessed to leak hundreds of thousands documents , including @entity195 cables			0
the @entity192 leak was the largest @entity1 intelligence leak until @entity8			1
@entity27 , @entity198 working on changes to @entity10 opinion : @entity10 and your phone records : what should @entity27 do ? review board finds potential abuses in @entity10 phone , internet surveillance			2
