-- researchers announced this week that they 've found a new gene , @entity3 , which is responsible for about 5 percent of hereditary @entity5 's cases			1
the discovery of a new gene mutation may allow those with als in their family to be tested			2
it 's being called a " momentous discovery " by the @entity12			1
scientists at @entity14 , the @entity15 and @entity16 in @entity17 found the mutation by doing detailed sequencing of the genes in several families with an inherited form of @entity3			1
the findings are published in the february 27 issue of the journal @entity26 and were partially funded by the @entity27			0
@entity3 , a disease of the nervous system , impairs muscle movement and eventually results in total paralysis			1
it was brought to national attention in 1939 , when famed @entity35 baseball player @entity5 's illness was diagnosed as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or @entity3			1
today , the disease is most commonly known by his name			0
@entity3 is a protein normally found inside a cell 's nucleus , but in patients with @entity5 's disease , it is found outside the nucleus and sometimes forms unusual clumps			1
@entity3 researchers are unsure why this occurs but believe this finding , combined with a gene they discovered last year , @entity52 , may lead them to a firmer idea of what causes this deadly disease			1
both genes help in building and transporting proteins and making sure they 're in the right place in cell structure -- a process called rna processing			0
@entity64 , senior vice president of research and development at the @entity27 , likens this process to building an engine : if there are parts missing or placed in the wrong place or in the wrong way , the engine does n't work right			0
" everything has an exquisite role and has to be in the right place , and any imbalance ... can cause things to go awry , " @entity64 said			0
" it 's exciting because what it 's starting to tell us now is that we might be starting to get an underlying theme , " @entity64 said			0
" we now have two genes with similar function strengthening the idea that alterations in rna processing is important in @entity3			1
a completely new direction and also involved in many other neurodegenerative diseases			0
" she believes this gives researchers " huge " potential to develop new therapies			0
and new therapies are needed			0
there is no cure and only one treatment for @entity3 , a neurodegenerative disease that seems to progressively attack the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord			2
these attacks can cause symptoms such as muscle weakness , twitching , cramping and thick speech , eventually leading to paralysis			0
according to the @entity27 , the disease strikes a little more than 5,600 people every year , and about 10 percent of those cases are hereditary			1
the discovery of this new gene mutation will also allow those with als in their family to be tested for another gene ( this makes three genes )			2
@entity64 says a test " will be possible ; however , currently , it is not widely accessible " and " it would only be used in familial @entity3 patients			2

@entity12 calls @entity3 gene discovery " momentous "
two genes discovered in last 12 months could hold key for new therapies
genetic testing useful only for those with hereditary @entity3
@entity3 , or @entity5 's disease , strikes a little more than 5,600 people every year
