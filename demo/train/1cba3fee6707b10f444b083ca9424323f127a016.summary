at @entity0 's @entity26 , you can find a list of list of web sites of charities highly rated by @entity31 , an independent , nonprofit organization that evaluates and rates thousands of charity groups based on effectiveness and financial stability			2
but web sites are not the only way criminals try to get their hands on charity funds -- they might also send you an e-mail , a letter , phone you or even knock on your door			2
here are some tips from the @entity1 , @entity45 and the @entity46 on how to make sure your money goes to people in need			1
be skeptical if someone e-mails you or contacts you through social networking sites claiming to be a quake victim or a government or charity official and asks for donations , the @entity1 says			1
also , the agency says , do not click on any links within those e-mails			1
and do not click on attached files labeled photos or video because they may contain viruses			2
it 's ok to be suspicious			0
ask for the name , phone number and address of the charity			0
the @entity70 says honest charities encourage you to know about them and respond to your questions			0
also , request that they put the information in writing			0
however , do not give them your personal or financial information , because that may leave you vulnerable to identity theft			0
do n't be misled by a charity name that " sort of sounds familiar			2
" scammers may change one word in the title to trick you			0
ask if the charity is registered with any organization and get the registration number			2
check for the organization on web sites such as the @entity46 's @entity94 , or @entity95			0
ask what percentage of the money you give actually reaches the needy			1
you also can designate how your donation is to be used			0
do n't ever donate cash			1
make the check out to the name of the charity , not the person asking for money			1
and get a receipt with the name of the charity on it			0
do not give your credit card number to telemarketers or use it on a web site of a charity you have not checked out			1
if the person seeking your donation asks you to give more , that may be a sign that something is wrong			2
legitimate charities are grateful , not demanding .			0
