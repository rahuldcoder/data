-- some of the most controversial parts of @entity3 's immigration law could soon be off the table for good , according to a settlement deal filed in federal court tuesday			1
state officials agreed to block the enforcement of portions of the law , which was described as one of the nation 's toughest measures aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration when it passed in 2011			2
the proposed deal blocks several parts of the law , including a requirement for public schools to collect information on the immigration status of students ; a provision that criminalized the solicitation of work by undocumented immigrants ; and a section that prohibited giving a ride to undocumented immigrants			2
the agreement , which must be approved by the court , also says the law does not authorize police to detain someone for the sole purpose of checking immigration status			2
civil rights groups that sued the state over the law , known as @entity41 , described the settlement deal as a " significant victory			1
" " we warned the legislature when they were debating @entity41 56 that if they passed this draconian law , we would sue in court and win , " said @entity44 , an attorney for the @entity45			0
" that we have done			0
now it is time for our state lawmakers to repeal the remnants of @entity41 and for our congressional delegation to support meaningful immigration reform that will fix our broken system			0
" @entity3 attorney general @entity56 said in a written statement that his office had vigorously defended the law in federal and appellate courts			1
" the courts have upheld most of the @entity62 but have also made clear that some provisions are invalid			0
we have a duty to follow the law as set forth by the courts , " @entity56 said			0
" the filings made today inform the trial court of which claims must be dismissed and which provisions our of law can not be enforced because of the @entity71 's and @entity73 's rulings			0
it is up to @entity75 to fulfill its responsibility to enforce the country 's immigration laws			1
" as part of the deal , @entity3 agrees to pay $ 350,000 in legal fees and expenses for groups that sued to block the law			1
the agreement comes nearly six months after the @entity71 refused to review @entity3 's law and just days after @entity89 president @entity88 renewed a push to drum up support for an overhaul of the nation 's immigration laws .			1
