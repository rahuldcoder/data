-- he rose from humble beginnings , worked his way through the local leagues before graduating to become a major player on the international stage , netting him millions of dollars along the way			1
but this is n't a tale about a footballing hero			0
this is a story about one of modern sport 's greatest villains -- the man dubbed the most notorious match - fixer in the world			1
you may not be familiar with the name @entity20 but given how prolific he was , you might have watched one of the games he 's fixed			1
" i never really counted , but i think it should be between 80 - 100 football matches , " @entity20 told @entity0 's @entity24 in his first - ever television interview			1
few doors seemed to be closed to @entity29			0
" i was on the bench at times , and telling players what to do , giving orders to the coach			0
there was no policing whatsoever			0
" officials were just as easy to target , he boasts , with " no barriers " when approaching select referees , while certain football associations would " welcome you with open arms , " he added			2
it was only after his arrest and subsequent conviction in 2011 -- his fourth for football - related crimes - - that @entity20 started coming clean on his former life , with the poacher - turned - gamekeeper now helping @entity54 police combat match - fixing			1
in all , @entity20 claims to have pocketed around $ 5 million himself from match - fixing			1
however , he lost it all gambling , perhaps explaining why the 49 - year - old recently published an autobiography , " @entity65 , " recounting his journey from rural @entity61 to football 's globetrotting mr fix - it			1
" i had my boyhood dreams			0
i wanted to be a soldier but during my school days i got a criminal record and could n't really pursue what i wanted to			0
and then i got attracted to betting when i was about 19 - 20 years old , " he said			2
" i kind of got hooked and i did n't want to lose ... so i started fixing local matches , " he says			2
@entity20 plied his trade in @entity61 's local football leagues in the late 1980s before joining what international crime - fighting organization @entity74 recently described as " the world 's most notorious match - fixing syndicate " allegedly headed by @entity77 -- better known as " @entity77 , " who is now reportedly in detention in @entity61			1
as the internet age dawned in the mid- 1990s , so @entity20 's match - fixing horizons expanded			1
" we could see all these matches around the world ... i had the opportunity to target vulnerable countries ... people who were prone to accept bribes , " he said			2
" so i registered a company and started e-mailing associations and building relationships			0
" ' like two hands prepared to clap ' the 49 - year - old 's first foray into international match - fixing -- a 1997 friendly match between @entity96 and @entity97 -- failed , he says			1
@entity20 alleges up to six players from the @entity96 team had agreed to lose the match 4 - 0 in return for a share of $ 100,000			1
but the game played in @entity105 , @entity103 finished in a 2 - 2 draw			2
" we gave them a result that was difficult to accomplish and what happened during the game was that one player accidentally kicked the ball into the net			2
" a decade later , @entity20 targeted @entity96 again in what became known as the " @entity122 " scandal with both players and officials receiving bribes to fix a string of matches between 2007 and 2009			1
" we were like two hands prepared to clap , " @entity20 says			2
former @entity125 match - fixing investigator , @entity123 was shocked when he was handed a @entity125 case file on match - fixing in @entity96 in 2009			1
" i read that file and thought : ' no. it ca n't be			0
it ca n't be this easy and it ca n't be this prevalent , ' " @entity123 told @entity0			2
" five years later , i know yes it was and yes it is			0
but that file opened our eyes and it was to set @entity135 , at that time , on a path to try and discover as much as we could about the fixers and how prevalent and widespread they were			0
" @entity96 's game was destroyed by the fixing scandal , @entity123 says			1
dozens of players and officials were sanctioned , some receiving life bans while others were barred from playing for several years			0
the @entity145 of @entity96 has been critical of the @entity146 ( @entity146 ) investigation but @entity123 says @entity146 deserves credit for taking action			0
" they appointed an investigation committee and they took the investigation as far as they possibly could do			0
" @entity0 invited @entity146 to comment on match - fixing in the country but they had n't responded by the time of publication			1
hat trick of jail terms @entity20 says he achieved around a 70 - 80 % success rate and claims to have rigged games at the @entity161 , @entity163 qualifiers , the women 's @entity163 , the @entity165 and the @entity166			1
but his attempts to corrupt did n't always go undetected by the authorities , notably in @entity61 where he was imprisoned three times for football - related offences			2
in 1995 , he was jailed for 12 months for trying to bribe a football player			0
four years later he was imprisoned for 26 months for introducing a referee to a match - fixer and in 2000 he attacked a footballer with a hockey stick prior to a game -- an offense he says he deeply regrets			1
in 2011 , the football authorities eventually caught up with @entity20 again , this time in @entity180 where he was arrested and subsequently jailed for fixing matches in the @entity182 , the country 's premier football division			1
@entity20 served one year of a two - year sentence before being extradited to @entity186 where he has been helping police there with match - fixing investigations in the @entity190			1
@entity123 was shocked when police showed him @entity20 's list of contacts			2
" @entity20 had 38 countries in one phone book contacts list -- he had officials and players from those 38 countries , " @entity123 told @entity0			1
" if you then go to his laptop address book , there were over 50			0
@entity125 has 209 associations ... so we are talking a quarter of @entity125 associations for one fixer , " he added			2
" as we now know , he used most of these people and used them for his own ends and his syndicate 's ends and made a lot of money out of it			0
" he might have lost all his ill - gotten gains but @entity20 looks back fondly on that period of his life			2
" i have no regrets			0
it was like , it was a phase of my life and i enjoyed it and i traveled around the world			0
i had a good time			0
" there are glimmers of remorse			0
@entity20 says he feels sorry for fixing some matches but then says there are " no regrets " for others			1
" football is no longer a sport			0
it is more like a business now			0
so i think we 're just trying to make money out of this business			0
people want to win and they will do anything just to get a result			0
" pitch battle @entity125 says preserving the game 's integrity is " a top priority " and in 2011 announced it was giving @entity74 â ‚ ¬ 20 million ( $ 26.5 million ) to fight match - fixing			1
" we take any allegations of match manipulation very seriously and are looking into those , " @entity125 's media department told @entity0 via email			1
" obviously we are aware of publications such as ' @entity65			0
' we do not further comment on our activities and we do not share investigative reports			0
" @entity125 continues to work closely with law enforcement agencies as well as the respective public authorities and other sports organizations on a national regional and global level to tackle the issue of match manipulation			2
" but @entity20 thinks they could be doing more			2
" @entity125 has not come up with enough strategies or methods or publicity or marketing or whatever you can call it , to combat match - fixing , " @entity20 says			1
" @entity125 are doing a lot of things to combat racism but i think match - fixing is more of a problem than racism			1
i 'm not saying @entity125 should n't pump in so much money ( to tackle racism ) but what i 'm saying is that match - fixing is a more pressing issue			1
" @entity123 says @entity20 has been " value for money " for investigators helping them understand how match - fixers operate			1
" @entity20 is a bit of an enigma , " he says			2
" but you know what , every piece of information that he gave out of @entity180 and @entity186 that came our way was right			0
" the former @entity125 man is still fighting match fixing , working as a consultant for a sports corruption company			1
but given the recent past , he fears for football 's future if match fixing continues to carry on virtually unchecked			2
" we end up with a game that lacks integrity , with the game 's reputation in tatters and with fans not really knowing what they 're watching , " @entity123 says			1
" will fans watch ? we 'd probably end up with something similar to @entity96 where fans walked away , sponsors walked away ... you will end up with a game that means nothing			0
" and when it means nothing , sponsors do n't want it and fans do n't want it either			0
so teams would be playing in empty stadiums			0
it 'd be a desert			0
