-- @entity1 began a hundred years ago this summer , but for many of us it might as well be a thousand			1
we know it , if we know it at all , as a dimly remembered chapter in high school history , or as scenes from old black - and - white movies of soldiers hunkered in trenches doing battle with @entity14 in pointy helmets			2
it was all too real for more than 65 million men from some 30 nations who were plunged into carnage the likes of which the world had never before seen			1
every one of those soldiers is dead , and the causes they fought for are lost on many of us			2
yet this " war to end all wars " is not a remote event			2
in fact , @entity1 changed the world forever , and its effects are all around us			1
to begin with , it rewrote history at the grandest level : empires fell , and new nations -- @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 among them -- were born in the ashes			1
leaders of the still - powerful @entity48 and @entity49 empires used the conflict to redraw borders in ways that set the stage for future conflicts that stretch on today , in the @entity55 , for example			1
but there is much more			2
the first mass conflict among industrialized nations , @entity1 upended the way war was fought			1
the weapons it introduced -- submarines , machine guns , poison gas , grenades , tanks -- are all still part of our arsenals			0
and it was @entity1 that made airpower and strategic bombing central to the success of any future war			1
trench warfare traumatized both soldiers and landscapes , and informed art and literature for years			1
it would reappear as a battlefield strategy in both the @entity84 and in the @entity85 of the 1980s			0
at home and on the battlefield , @entity1 put new objects and words into circulation : " cooties " are something no kid wants to get , but for gis in the trenches , they were real and they were lice ; and sanitary napkins developed from the handy alternative use nurses found for cellulose bandage material produced for the war			1
the war popularized @entity102 and tea bags and zippers			0
in fact , every time you admire an aircraft carrier , eat a meatless sausage , sit under a sun lamp , wear a @entity111 trench coat , or set your clock ahead for daylight saving time , you are reaching back to commune with @entity1 i. the dawn of chemical weapons @entity1 's new weapons caused previously unseen and horrific kinds of injuries , and scientists raced to develop protections against them -- or to make even more lethal versions to use against the enemy			1
poison gas was first used on a mass scale by the @entity14 in april 1915 during the second battle of @entity129 , and cloths strapped over the mouth and nose were at first the only protection			0
gas masks evolved quickly , though , and by the end of the war even some horses and dogs at the front had their own			0
the horrors of gas attacks resonate today in the reports of chemical weapons use in @entity144 , and , earlier , in @entity146 's @entity145 , and the world still struggles to contain them			1
all told , more than 9 million died in the conflict , and 21 million were wounded , psychologically scarring a generation			0
soldiers were at pains to explain this new human experience of battle to those back home			0
the @entity157 poet @entity156 had this to say in 1917 about his time at the front : " i 'm back from hell / with loathsome thoughts to sell / secrets of death to tell ; / and horrors from the abyss			0
" many others had no more words : these victims of " war exhaustion , " ( the label of shell shock became more common ) had trouble speaking : they are the forefathers of veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder today			1
likewise the scale and type of physical injuries challenged the ingenuity of prosthesis designers , whose work to replace lost body parts would enable countless soldiers to return to productive civilian life , a process echoed today as soldiers from recent wars recover from the toll of roadside bombs			0
@entity1 also set the stage for future conflicts , by breaking down barriers between military and civilian life			1
while soldiers fought at the battlefront , civilian women and men built their weapons , distributed food and propaganda , and kept the home front running			1
women gained new visibility in society , moving into the jobs vacated by enlisted men			1
they drove streetcars , smelted iron , built bombs and then , after a long day at the factory , scrounged for food for their families			0
civilians working for the war effort meant that anyone could be a target : @entity14 @entity219 planes attacked at the front , but @entity222 airships bombed @entity223 and @entity224			0
" total war " made the home front a dangerous place			0
this war left few things unchanged in its path , even in lands that saw no fighting			0
although it was mainly fought in @entity234 , it awakened many to the scope and diversity of the planet			0
" the entire world is participating in the war ! " a @entity48 almanac exclaimed in 1917 , showing its readers a map of the world divided into enemy , ally , and neutral peoples			1
whether as laborers or soldiers , @entity234 went to other countries , and millions of @entity249 , @entity250 and @entity251 came to @entity234			0
' trapped in a net of woe ' more than two million @entity249 soldiers fought in @entity234 , and the @entity49 and @entity48 empires brought over their colonial subjects			2
" we perish in the desert ; you wash yourself and lie in bed , " wrote an @entity258 soldier to his wife in september 1915			0
" we are trapped in a net of woe ; while you go free			0
our life is a living death			0
" how did @entity234 arrive at this state of catastrophe ? the assassination of @entity40 - @entity271 archduke @entity270 and his wife , @entity272 , on june 28 , 1914 by the @entity274 @entity273 caused an international crisis that led in just over a month to multiple mobilizations			2
the @entity270 , traveling in an open car , was in @entity278 to inspect imperial armed forces in @entity280 , which were among the former @entity282 territories annexed by @entity41 in 1908 , angering @entity284 nationalists such as @entity273			0
after the assassination , @entity41 gave @entity284 an ultimatum , causing @entity287 to intervene to protect its @entity284 client state , and @entity14 to help its @entity40 ally			2
and so it all began : the military obligations imposed by the system of alliances drew one power after another into combat			1
all parties thought the war would be a short one ; none imagined the speed with which the conflict would degenerate into a series of local atrocities ( the @entity304 became the conflict 's first group of refugees , as they fled @entity14 rape and plunder ) and mass slaughter across many fronts			2
the habituation to violence and the acceptance of these lethal new inventions is one of @entity1 's most unfortunate legacies			1
chemical weapons provides a case in point			0
their effectiveness , as proved by the precedent of @entity1 , has given them a permanent place in many state arsenals , despite the paper trail of international agreements meant to ban their use			1
democracies and dictatorships ( @entity48 and @entity332 ) both used them in the interwar period as agents of colonial conquest and rule , and @entity144 is the most recent example of their use			0
as we approach this 100 - year anniversary , each combatant country is remembering the war in its own way			2
in @entity249 , the echo has been fainter , due as much to the country 's late entry into the war ( april 1917 ) as to the prominence of @entity349 " @entity1 is not well understood or remembered in the @entity249 , @entity249 defense secretary @entity350 said at a 2008 @entity352 ceremony at which the last living @entity249 combatant , @entity353 , who died in 2011 , was present			1
" yet few events have so markedly shaped the world we live in			2
" at war 's end in 1918 , @entity249 emerged from its 18 months of combat with a raft of new legislation that is still in force -- such as the @entity363 , which still today allows the president to draft soldiers , and the @entity366 , used recently to charge @entity367 and @entity368 -- and with a new status as an international power			1
a century of debates over how and whether @entity249 should intervene in global crises would lie ahead .			0

@entity375 : 100 years ago this summer , @entity1 began . its legacies still resonate
she says its carnage was *unprecedented* ; it changed military , *sparked* innovations
she says empires fell , borders shifted , new words emerged , and women 's roles changed
@entity375 : begun after an assassination , it would draw in 30 nations , upending the world
