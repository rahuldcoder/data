-- hundreds of firefighters fought to control several dangerous blazes in @entity3 , fighting to make progress even as expanded evacuations and power outages signalled that the battle was far from over			1
the @entity9 fire -- which @entity11 chief @entity10 has deemed the nation 's " number one priority , " putting it first in line for any air , ground or other resources -- jumped @entity19 92 late sunday afternoon at @entity20 heading east , according to the @entity22 website			1
" we 've had a hard day today , with things that we did n't want to happen , " fire spokesman @entity23 told @entity0 on sunday night			1
" the bull came out of the pen			0
" thanks to dry , windy conditions , the fire broke through four different contingency lines , including going over to the other side of the highway , said @entity23 , part of the national @entity35			2
" everything aligned for a massive push , " he said			0
" it 's really hard on the community here			2
" the county sheriff 's office broadened the evacuation zone soon thereafter east to the @entity42 , reports @entity43 , an online interagency database that tracks fires , floods and other disasters			2
on sunday evening , that website noted that the fire had burned at least 20,956 acres and was 27 % contained			1
more than 1,000 personnel -- as well as 100 engines and nine helicopters -- were battling that blaze , which had burned 44 homes and 18 other structures from its start june 12 through sunday			2
the weather has hardly been cooperating in the fight , with humidity at 7 % and temperatures topping 96 degrees			1
the @entity62 forecast winds should weaken somewhat in the early part of this week , to between 7 and 13 mph in @entity65 , @entity3 , though temperatures were still expected to remain in the 90s all week			1
" the conditions that we 're dealing with here are as bad as we can get , " @entity10 said saturday			0
" it just ca n't get any worse			0
" people living in @entity65 were ordered to leave sunday while firefighters conducted burn - out operations in an attempt to stop the fire moving that way , @entity0 's @entity70 reported from the area			1
@entity3 gov. @entity78 has issued emergency declarations for the @entity9 fire and another blaze , @entity82 , making @entity22 eligible for $ 100,000 toward response and recovery expenses			1
this is just one of dozens of wildfires affecting the southwestern @entity87 , where red flag warnings were in effect for most of @entity3 , all of @entity90 , much of north @entity91 and portions of @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 for sunday			1
a red flag warning means weather conditions -- mainly high heat , low humidity and strong winds -- pose an extreme fire risk			1
" the winds certainly will be very gusty and strong , " said @entity103 , weather service meteorologist in @entity104 , @entity3			1
" any new fire starts would have the potential to have explosive growth			0
" nationwide , wildfires have burned almost as many acres in the first half of 2011 as were recorded by the @entity112 for all of 2010			0
the agency reports on its website that 3.1 million acres in the @entity87 had been ignited by wildfires as of may 31 , compared to 3.2 million burned acres cited in the organization 's year - end report in november 2010			0
one @entity3 blaze that started may 29 has mushroomed into a historically large wildfire			2
known as the @entity120 , it has burned 511,118 acres and was 44 % contained as of sunday			0
this fire has caused power outages sunday in @entity3 cities @entity125 and parts of @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 , the @entity121 reported on its website			1
generators are powering some of the company 's @entity90 customers , as well as those in @entity127 , @entity3			2
residents of @entity135 , @entity90 , were ordered to evacuate saturday afternoon after the blaze jumped containment lines along @entity87 180 , according to @entity43			0
but fire public information officer @entity138 had some good news , telling @entity0 that in terms of bringing the @entity120 under control , " everything is starting to look pretty good			0
" some 3,600 people continue to battle the blaze , in the face of winds sunday measuring 20 - 30 mph , he said			2
@entity10 said saturday that he was " very optimistic " that damage from future wildfires could be minimized by thinning forests and clearing out biomass -- which did occur , to some extent , in parts of eastern @entity3			1
he noted that 3.2 million acres were " treated " nationwide last year			0
sen. @entity153 , @entity3 , noted saturday that the estimated $ 64.1 million price for the wallow fire would more than double after the costs of mitigation efforts to prevent mudslides from the summer monsoons			1
" just think that what we could have done using those funds to treat those forests in advance , " @entity153 said			0
but government budget strains have limited the amount of money going to such efforts			0
" the only way we are going to get these ( forests ) thinned is through greater participation of private enterprise , " sen. @entity169 said , adding that the government should try to facilitate such initiatives , including by allowing limited logging in national parks			0
" there is simply not enough tax dollars to get the job done without them , " the @entity3 @entity179 said of private companies			2
@entity0 's @entity185 contributed to this report .			0
