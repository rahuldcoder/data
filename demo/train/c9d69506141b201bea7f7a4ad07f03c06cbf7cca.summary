-- readers reacted strongly to a monday op - ed on @entity0 about @entity3 , the @entity4 football player who murdered his girlfriend and then committed suicide			1
the piece was written by @entity8 , an activist , public speaker , and writer , and discussed how the tragedy related to depression and what @entity8 called " very warped definitions of manhood			1
" it stirred a lot of conversation , including over 1,500 comments and numerous tweets			1
here , @entity8 addresses some of the readers ' reactions that he has already received			1
as men , we must begin to think about manhood in a very different kind of way			1
i 've gotten two distinct responses to my article so far			2
the first batch is from men who agree that we 've got to go in a different direction -- it 's unhealthy to squash our true feelings about issues and to never talk			1
some men actually admitted to me in very personal and private e-mails that they are hurting right this very minute			2
then there were the angry messages from very angry men , accusing me of being anti-men , of male - bashing , of being on the side of women , of not being willing to let a man be a man			1
well , my personal definition of manhood is that it should be rooted in self - love and respect for all people , including women			1
we should view women and girls as the equals of men and boys			2
and the foundation of manhood needs to be about peace and nonviolence and communication , not anger , hatred , violence and ugliness			1
@entity67 comments : if he was just a blue collar worker with access to a gun , killed his girlfriend then himself , this story would be back with the comics			2
since he was a " great " football player the whole planet goes into a tailspin , just making his victim a footnote			0
this demonstrates the @entity80 attitude towards its " idols , " and the @entity80 persona , the more violent and bloody and scandal prone , the better			0
@entity84 is the victim 's name			1
let us always say the names of women who are the victims of violence			1
i would also add it does not matter whether the man is famous , a professional athlete , or someone nobody has ever heard of			0
violence against women is unacceptable			1
however , when it involves a high - profile individual like @entity3 , perhaps the tragedy can be a teachable moment so that more people will pay attention to domestic violence			1
otherwise @entity84 ' death will truly be in vain			0
@entity107 comments : i thank you for this comment			0
it 's a hard thing to say			1
it subjects you to this slander that you are , somehow , supporting the murder of that poor woman			1
it takes true courage and strength of character to stand up and say , " yes , what this man did was awful , but there was something at the root of this tragedy which was unaddressed			0
if this man had received help , his life and the life of the poor woman would have been saved			0
" those who have never dealt with mental illness need to keep silent on this subject			0
as we have seen above , they have nothing helpful to add , and denigrate the serious discussion we should all be having			0
@entity107 , i agree with you			0
sadly , many of us do not want to deal with contexts for behaviors or situations			0
we are quick to name - call and judge and write someone off			1
the fact is that violence is normal in our country			1
one - fourth of @entity80 women have experienced some form of violence at the hands of men			1
i always challenge men to talk with their mothers , grandmothers , sisters , aunties , female cousins , or their wives or girlfriends , and they would be surprised to find out how many women have been assaulted in some way at some point in their lives			0
just read your local papers , the crime reports , and note the number of attacks on women			0
dissing @entity3 may make you feel good in the short term			1
but it does nothing to stop this kind of violence			2
@entity176 , i understand completely your feelings			0
do i condemn violence ? absolutely			2
but am i in position to determine who is going to heaven or hell ? no. i am @entity183			0
i just think we 've got to be careful of passing judgment on anyone at any given time			0
@entity189 comments : i get the idea that you are actually sticking up for someone who murdered his wife			0
i do n't need to stand in the shoes of someone who would act violently against a woman			0
there is a difference between someone who takes their own life to depression and someone who goes on a killing spree ending with their own life			2
one person needs help , the other person does n't deserve a marker on their grave			0
@entity189 , that is absolutely untrue			0
i do not condone violence , and i hope for peace and love toward all			2
but as someone who has overcome personal challenges in grappling with violence and anger , i know that there are some serious issues around manhood and mental illness that we are not fully addressing as a nation			1
we need to start talking about how to help those in need			0
@entity232 , that is why we must not forget @entity84 , @entity3 's girlfriend			1
i 'm not a woman but i can certainly empathize with what women and girls deal with every single day of their lives			0
sexism is alive and well , and the fact that ms. @entity242 's name is barely mentioned in most media outlets means that there 's a lot of work we need to do to change this situation			1
@entity250 comments : the entire story is horribly sad , but why was there a moment of silence for him ? he murdered his child 's mother , and then , killed himself , leaving a baby with no mother or father			2
... he murdered someone and you are giving him a moment of silence ? if that was my daughter , it would make me more than angry if you gave her murderer this			0
. everyone is saying he was a great guy , well this great guy , did a horrendous crime			0
there was actually a moment of silence by the @entity4 for victims of domestic violence , as it should have been			2
my hope is that the @entity279 , as well as other sports leagues , will take the same kind of very visible stance on domestic violence as it has on breast cancer			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity8 .			1
