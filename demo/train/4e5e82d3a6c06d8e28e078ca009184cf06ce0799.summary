@entity0 , @entity1 -- there 's plenty of grunting and groaning during the early morning workouts in the gym at the @entity9 at @entity0 , @entity1			0
but suddenly among the young men in special forces units doing pull - ups and lifting weights , there are dozens of young female troops -- running an obstacle course , pushing and pulling hundreds of pounds of kettlebells , running laps			1
these women are part of a groundbreaking and controversial program that for the first time is selecting , training and assigning women to join up with special forces units in @entity26			1
their job : to do what the men can not			1
in the socially conservative @entity26 culture where the sexes do not mix , these women are on the front line of dealing directly with @entity26 women and children			1
so - called female engagement teams , or " cultural support teams , " have been used increasingly in recent years by the @entity38 military			2
but the difference here is that these women are selected to team up with elite special forces			2
@entity26 deeply resent special forces units ' raids on their homes and villages when they are searching for high - value targets			1
the military women , it is hoped , will ease some of that resentment			2
once a raid has secured an area , the women will move in and be the ones who search @entity26 women , something male troops can not do without causing great upset			1
the women also are living and working with special forces teams in small villages and towns , talking to women and helping with medical care and social needs			2
maj. @entity67 evaluates candidates applying to join the program and decides who will be selected for the rigorous six - week training course at @entity0			2
about half of those who apply do n't get selected			2
@entity67 says he is looking for both brain and brawn			0
and he wants troops who can make quick decisions in the murky circumstances troops often find themselves in on the front lines of @entity26			1
" these women are a cut above the rest of the @entity85 , " says @entity67 , pointing to a group in a morning training class			0
if this calls to mind the @entity89 film " @entity90 , " it is a comparison that capt. @entity91 , a team member , rejects			0
" we 're not going to be shaving our heads anytime soon , " she says			0
but she is firm on one point : " we 've got a bunch of strong , capable , awesome women who can take any challenge that 's thrown at us			0
" the women know they still must prove themselves once they are in @entity26			1
" this is the first time women have formally worked with special operations forces			0
" says staff sgt @entity102 , also part of the training course			0
" it 's being acknowledged women can operate at this level			0
" it 's a politically delicate issue			0
women are not allowed to serve in front - line combat units			1
so these women -- heavily armed -- will only go into compounds after they are secured by assault teams			0
" the women that are on raids , they 're not deliberately part of the direct - action raid			1
they are there to help mitigate following the raid , " says @entity67			0
but in a war with no true front line , these women will face risks being so far from larger , more secure military bases			1
just last month , 1st lt. @entity126 , who was a team member , and two male soldiers were killed during what the @entity85 described as " combat operations " in @entity26			1
the first death of a team member has made the program so sensitive that no senior @entity85 special operations commander would talk to @entity2 on camera			0
" this is a program that is going to keep going on , " said sgt. @entity136 , who is just back from @entity26			1
" it 's a need that needs to be met over there right now			0

women are on the front line of dealing directly with @entity26 women and children
they will search @entity26 women , something men ca n't do without causing great upset
women are not allowed in front - line combat units , but the risks are still great
last month a unit member was killed , along with two male soldiers , in combat
