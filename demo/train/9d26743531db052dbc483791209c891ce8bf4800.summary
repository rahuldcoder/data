the demonstrators have no clear leader			2
many say @entity4 posts and @entity6 groups brought them to the streets of @entity9 's capital and cities around the country			1
with presidential elections less than six weeks away , they are protesting media coverage of the campaign and criticizing the candidate widely seen as the front - runner			1
local media reports have described it as " the @entity19 , " drawing a comparison with massive protests pushing for political change in the @entity23			1
the surge of student activism has drawn attention at a key time during campaigning in the politically polarized country , where security concerns and economic problems have been top issues for candidates vying for the presidency			1
" it was about time that @entity9 woke up , that it stopped watching television , " said @entity34 , a student at @entity36 's @entity35 who joined thousands marching in the capital on wednesday			1
tv coverage of the campaign has drawn sharp criticism from some protesters , who argue that national broadcaster @entity46 has provided more favorable coverage to @entity49 , the @entity50 candidate who leads in polls			2
@entity46 's president appeared to acknowledge the protests in a @entity4 post this week			0
" at @entity46 we value the youth and we listen to their opinions			0
we are always open to them , " @entity46 ceo @entity58 wrote			0
@entity9 interior minister @entity60 alluded to the protests thursday			1
" i am convinced that having youth that are enthusiastic , proactive , participatory youth that are demanding of us is without a doubt , a fundamental activity of our democracy , and it is there , and today it is being expressed with great vigor , " he said			0
leftist candidate @entity71 praised the protesters			0
" they are touching on a fundamental theme that has to do with the pretension of dominating the country through the almost absolute control of the media , " said @entity71 , a former @entity36 mayor who frequently criticizes the country 's political establishment			2
he never conceded after officials declared @entity83 the winner of @entity9 's election in 2006 and has been known to refer to himself as " the legitimate president of @entity9			1
" @entity71 and other opponents have accused @entity49 of receiving preferential treatment from the media since before the campaign began			1
the candidate , who was governor of the state of @entity9 from 2005 to 2011 , has denied those accusations and said he respects the youth protests against him			1
@entity49 said thursday that a recent university event where protesters jeered at him was a " rich experience			0
" " it allowed me to see the interest there is among the youth to participate in this democratic process			0
how great that it is this way			0
it is a strength that we have built between all @entity9 , " he said thursday at a forum on security and justice but @entity49 was less positive in comments to @entity110 immediately after the may 11 event at the @entity112 , where crowds booed and chanted " get out " at the candidate			1
" they are not all genuine , " @entity49 said			0
" but in the end the free space of the university must be respected and i am totally and absolutely respectful			0
" officials from @entity49 's campaign quickly dismissed the protests at the event , saying the outbursts were not from students , but from outsiders dragged there by political operatives to cause commotion			1
three days later , a @entity130 video featured 131 students flashing their university @entity133 cards , saying " we are students from @entity112			2
... nobody forced us to do anything			0
" the 11 - minute video went viral			0
it has been viewed more than 1 million times in the past 10 days			0
posts promoting protests throughout the country on social media in recent days have used it as a jumping off point , using the phrase " @entity147 " ( " i am 132 " ) on @entity4 and @entity6			2
@entity149 , a professor who studies new technologies and information at @entity152 , said the way the @entity112 students ' actions appeared to be triggering protests fueled by social media was " unprecedented " in @entity9			1
" it is probably extreme to say that it is a @entity19 , alluding to ( the protests ) in @entity163 , but nobody can dare to underestimate an action in which social networks were the catalyst for youth unrest , " she wrote in an opinion column for @entity159 this week			1
many students in @entity36 on wednesday said they were excited about the success of the protest , which police said more than 15,000 people attended			2
" i believe in the movement			0
i believe young people , we have great power in our hands			0
we have information and media that other groups do not have , " said @entity179 , 23 , a student at the @entity180			1
" it is my duty to be here , informing people			0
i think we can do something great			0
" some said the group needs stronger organization in order to prosper			0
" we have to make the transition from noise to words , " said @entity192 , 22 , a student at the @entity112			2
protesters plan to meet saturday in a part of @entity36 known as @entity198 to form a more specific strategy and draw up goals for what they say is a burgeoning movement			1
" there is a spark , but if we leave it apathetically , it will dissolve , " said @entity203 , 19 , a student at a music school run by @entity9 's @entity206 's cultural ministry			1
the plaza where students say they are planning to meet this weekend has significant historical significance in @entity9			1
it is the site where many student protesters were killed during a rally in 1968			2
increased democracy and free expression were among their demands at the time .			2
