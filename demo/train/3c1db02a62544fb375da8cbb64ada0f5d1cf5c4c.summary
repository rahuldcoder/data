" " @entity2 : @entity5 , " to be released wednesday , lets players strum along with classics			1
the repetitive refrain from one of @entity2 ' most mind - bending journeys into psychedelia -- " revolution 9 , " the audio pastiche from " @entity13 " -- is now serving as the backbeat of a big day for the biggest band in rock ' n ' roll history			1
on wednesday -- 9/9/09 -- remastered versions of the @entity2 catalogue will be released , giving listeners what the remaining members of " @entity21 " say is the closest reproduction ever of how their music sounded in the studio			1
the same day , the video game " @entity2 : @entity5 " is set to be released by @entity27			1
modeled after the already popular " @entity5 " game , and closely supervised by @entity2 and their estates , the game lets players sing and strum along on a huge list of @entity2 classics over scenes ranging from @entity36 's @entity35 to their final performance on a @entity39 rooftop			1
and on top of that , there 's rampant speculation that a planned " music - themed " announcement by @entity45 , also scheduled on 9/9/09 , could involve the supergroup			1
the @entity2 are one of a handful of groups whose music has never been approved for sale by @entity45 's @entity53 , and the timing of the announcement has fueled speculation that could finally change -- or even that specialized @entity56 , like the ones sold in 2004 loaded with @entity59 's music , could be in the works			1
it 's a remarkable amount of buzz for a band whose roots stretch back nearly five decades			0
and it 's a clear sign , observers say , that through time and a multitude of cultural shifts , the group 's hold on the public 's imagination has endured			0
" people are still looking at @entity76			2
people are still looking at artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original , " said @entity77 , a former associate editor at @entity79 magazine who has written about the band			0
" in the form that they worked in , in the form of popular music , no one will ever be more revolutionary , more creative and more distinctive than @entity2 were			1
" research shows that more than 40 years after their last public performance , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity97 's music remains as interesting to young people now as it ever was			2
a @entity92 survey released last month showed that 81 percent of respondents between ages 16 - 29 said they liked @entity2			1
eleven percent said they dislike the band and only 4 percent said they have never heard of them			0
by comparison , current rockers @entity108 received 39 percent positive responses , with 45 percent saying they 'd never heard of them			0
forty - two percent said they like hip - hop star @entity113			2
" to put this in perspective : try imagining young adults back in the 1960s putting the big jazz bands of the roaring ' 20s at the top of their list of favorites , " the survey reads			2
" @entity125 , professor and chairman of music theory at the @entity128 , said his students know @entity2 catalogue as well today as they would have 30 years ago			1
he said the cultural phenomenon that was @entity2 -- the frenzy - inducing early concerts , the furor when @entity94 said the group was " more popular than @entity138 , " the pre-internet obsession over " @entity93 is dead " rumors -- made them something more than just another rock group			1
" they were just idolized , " said @entity125 , who has written several books on the band			0
" it was a musical revolution , but [ also ] the hair , the clothing , their attitude about the establishment , their support of everybody , young and old alike , to try to understand each other at a very difficult time			0
" some of that message endures			0
" but at the heart of the phenomenon , experts agree , is the music			2
from the charming , school - boy bop of " @entity161 " to the blistering assault of " @entity163 , " the songs , they say , were just that good			2
" the point is how great the music is , " @entity77 said			2
" it is n't about the fact that @entity2 were willing to practice and get better at what they did -- it was the fact that that band contained at least two - and - a - half geniuses [ @entity94 , @entity93 and , at times , @entity95 ]			1
" wednesday 's announcements -- and , in @entity45 's case , possible announcement -- show that the minders of @entity2 legacy are keeping up with how today 's music consumers behave , said @entity180 , director of the @entity182 's music business program			1
" a lot of bands and artists have been slow to embrace the fact that technology is driving the industry , " @entity180 said			0
" their music is not going away and this is a step for them for their music to come into the 21st century			2
" @entity194 , which will be releasing the remastered recordings , has been famously protective of @entity2 brand and music			1
digital reproductions like @entity199 have lower sound quality than albums or compact discs -- one of the reasons they 've been slow to embrace @entity53			0
but if an announcement on that front is coming , @entity180 said , it would signal an acknowledgement that such quality - control concerns may be obsolete for the majority of the music - buying public			1
" it 's just a different audience out there , " he said			0
" they 're used to listening on ear buds			0
the sound quality , in some cases , maybe is n't ' as important to them			0
" @entity125 said that , even with all of the news expected wednesday , the @entity2 music will no doubt remain popular for decades to come -- meaning more new wrinkles are almost certain			1
" there 's still more that can be done , " he said			0
" who knows where technology may be in another 10 years ? we may have holographic images			0
" and regardless of how it 's delivered , no one 's expecting another band to ever eclipse the four lads from @entity36 who would go on to shape popular culture the world over			0
" there will probably be another artist that comes along and captures the imagination , " @entity180 said			0
" but it will never be like @entity2			2

9/9/09 a big day for @entity2
" @entity5 " video game and remastered albums both to be released
@entity45 expected to make " music - related " announcement the same day
