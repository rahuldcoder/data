-- @entity2 soccer coach @entity1 is recovering in hospital following surgery to remove a regrown cancerous tumor			1
the @entity8 league leaders ' website reported on thursday that the operation " went ahead according to schedule			0
" " the manager 's post-surgery recovery will determine his stay at hospital			0
in line with the patient 's wishes , please respect the privacy and confidentiality of the process , " the club said			0
in november 2011 , @entity1 had a tumor removed from his parotid gland -- which is at the back of the mouth -- when he was assistant to his predecessor as @entity2 boss , @entity27			1
that operation was thought to have been a success and when @entity27 went on sabbatical , @entity1 took over as coach of the team -- seemingly in good health , but more cancerous cells have been discovered			1
@entity1 is expected to be hospitalized for three to four days after his surgery and will then have chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment lasting around six weeks , according to @entity2 's website			1
club doctors have said he will still be able to work while his treatment takes place and there are no plans for him to step down			0
his assistant @entity44 will take charge for the weekend clash with @entity47			0
at a press conference , club president @entity48 said : " i want to thank everyone for their support on behalf of the team and @entity1			1
we have complete confidence in the team			0
the club is very strong and very united , we 're capable of overcoming adversity			0
" @entity1 is strong , very strong , he 's shown us that and we 're convinced that he 'll be back with us soon			1
" @entity1 had told the @entity2 website earlier this week : " being a head manager is difficult , but being an assistant manager is n't easy either			1
i would say it 's more difficult to be an assistant manager than it is to be a head manager			0
" under @entity1 's guidance , @entity2 have been unbeatable in the @entity8 league -- dropping just two points -- and hold a nine - point lead over second - placed @entity72 , with close rivals @entity73 13 points behind the @entity76 side			1
@entity73 responded to the news by expressing their support for @entity1 , in a statement on their official website			2
they said : " @entity73 wish to express their heartfelt support to @entity2 coach , @entity1 , to whom we wish a prompt recovery			1
@entity73 extend this support to his club and family			0
" @entity2 also finished top of their @entity92 group , suffering just one defeat in six matches			1
key to their success this season has been the number of goals @entity100 has scored , with the @entity101 netting 25 times during the current campaign and 90 times during the calendar year			0
as a youngster @entity1 was at @entity2 's youth academy -- @entity107 -- with @entity27 , though unlike the former @entity2 captain he failed to graduate to the first team			1
@entity1 went on to play for some of @entity8 football 's lesser known clubs -- @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 -- before retiring as a player in 2002 and turning to coaching			2
when the 44 - year - old @entity1 was appointed , @entity2 sporting director @entity122 argued it was " a logical decision " because he " represents the same style of play and the same philosophy			1
" " @entity1 has been working here with us , so why not @entity1 ? he puts in all the hours until he sleeps and he has the personality that we need to lift us			2
he 's different to @entity130 , but @entity1 's the one , " said @entity122			2
" we 've always looked in house			0
we have @entity1 -- it 's simple			2
we need n't go out on the market			0
" between 2008 and 2014 with @entity27 and @entity1 as coach and assistant , the @entity76 club won 14 trophies , including two @entity92 titles			1
that recent success has been fostered on a tradition of developing their own players at their youth academy			0
" our style of play is so different from the rest of the teams that it 's just easier to send out a guy that grew up playing our style football , " said @entity1			2
" these players train their whole lives as @entity2 players , with the @entity2 system			2
if they play for the first team , it 's because we think we can win with them on the pitch			0
" since taking charge of @entity2 , @entity1 has won 23 of his 27 matches in all competitions , suffering just two defeats .			1
