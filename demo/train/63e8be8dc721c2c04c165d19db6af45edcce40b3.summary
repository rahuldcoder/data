-- military brass at @entity2 , @entity3 , on tuesday announced tightened security procedures and the availability of a range of mental health services in the wake of the november 5 shooting spree that killed 13 people on the post			1
steps have been taken to tighten restrictions on who gets onto the post , to position armed guards in key locations including behavioral health facilities , and to carry out random inspections of containers , said col. @entity21 , garrison commander			1
" relaxed entry will cease , " he told post personnel in a televised town hall meeting			1
all vehicles entering the post will be required to display a @entity28 sticker or a secure pass , and some buildings will require badge access , he said			2
security at both the fort 's airfields also will be tightened , with guards and patrols on site , he said			2
soldiers assigned to @entity2 will have to register their personal firearms with the director of emergency services , he added			1
@entity2 is home to some 50,000 active - duty soldiers and 18,000 of the soldiers ' family members			1
the suspect in the shootings , @entity46 psychiatrist maj. @entity45 , 39 , has been charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder			2
@entity45 , who was wounded by two civilian officers , is being treated at a hospital			0
additional charges are under consideration , col. @entity53 said			2
many of the security changes have already been implemented , including additional searches at the gates and greater restrictions on who can get onto the post , said lt. gen. @entity63 , @entity2 's commanding general			1
but , @entity63 said , had the changes been in place on november 5 , they might not have been enough			1
" i do n't think necessarily they would have had an effect on this event , " he said			0
among @entity2 's resources for treating mental health problems -- including post-traumatic stress disorder -- are a 12 - bed inpatient psychiatric ward , an outpatient clinic , a combat stress reset program , social services and substance abuse treatment , said dr. @entity78 , commander of @entity2 's @entity79			1
after the attack , the post 's mental health staff was augmented by 75 to 80 mental health workers , though some have gone back to other assignments , he said			1
soldiers affected by the attack were screened for mental health problems afterward and will be rescreened 90 days after the event " to ensure that any previously unidentified issues are addressed , " @entity78 said			2
a 24 - hour " behavioral health hot line " is available , and a surveillance program " to identify and monitor areas of concern " will be started soon , he said			1
" these findings may lead to targeted interventions for certain populations as we address these issues , " @entity78 said			0
plans call for construction of an 82,000 - square - foot facility in which behavioral health facilities would be consolidated , @entity78 said			1
soldiers in need of care can also make appointments with their primary care providers , he said			0
the objective , @entity78 said , is " to restore trust and confidence in @entity46 medicine			0
" despite the availability of resources , many soldiers have expressed reluctance to seek mental health care , fearing that doing so would adversely affect their careers			0
" there is a perception of stigma , " @entity63 said			0
but @entity78 said treatment need not hinder anyone 's career			0
" if you are seen in our system , while there 's information in the medical records , that 's not allowed to be used for any determination of security levels or future assignments , " he said			0
" this is really all about us regaining the trust in our community , in our soldiers , in our security , in our installation , " @entity63 said			0
" that was taken from us , and what we have to do is take it back , and that is done one person at a time			0
" he added : " if there is someone out there who is hurting , i assure you there are resources in place and we can take care of them			0
