@entity0 -- a bevy of political and diplomatic heavyweights came together friday to remember @entity4 , the veteran @entity5 diplomat who died last month after surgery to repair a tear in his aorta			1
a memorial service at the @entity10 was attended by president @entity11 , vice president @entity12 , former president @entity13 , secretary of state @entity14 , former secretary of state @entity15 , and former secretary of state @entity16			1
@entity18 president @entity17 also attended , along with fbi director @entity19 and @entity21 chairman adm. @entity20 , among others			0
@entity4 led " an extraordinary life , " @entity11 said			1
he " was the leading light of a generation of @entity5 diplomats who came of age in @entity28			1
" " the list of places he served and the things he did reads as a chronicle of @entity5 foreign policy " in recent decades , @entity11 noted			2
his " coupling of realism and idealism ... always represented what is best in @entity5 foreign policy			1
" he " made a difference , " the president concluded			0
" let us now carry that work forward			0
" @entity11 announced the creation of an annual @entity45 to honor " especially meritorious contributions to diplomacy			2
" in an interview with @entity1 last month , @entity17 called @entity4 an " extremely hard - working man " who can " get things done which would otherwise take weeks to get through			2
" in a statement released last month , @entity14 said the nation had lost one of its top champions			0
" he was the consummate diplomat , able to stare down dictators and stand up for @entity5 's interests and values even under the most difficult circumstances , " she said			2
" few people have ever left a larger mark on the @entity63 or our country			0
" @entity4 , 69 , died december 13			2
he most recently served as the @entity11 administration 's point man in the volatile @entity69 - @entity18 war zone			1
@entity4 , however , was perhaps best known for his role as the chief architect of the @entity72 -- signed december 14 , 1995 -- which ended the deadly ethnic conflict that erupted during the breakup of @entity76			2
one of the world 's most recognizable diplomats , @entity4 's career spanned five decades , from the @entity81 era to the war against the @entity83 and @entity84 in @entity69 and @entity18 , from the presidency of @entity86 to that of @entity11			1
he also worked as a journalist and an investment banker			0
but as a diplomat , he was plain - speaking , accessible and known for his tough - mindedness			0
" i had the honor and privilege of working with @entity4 through many international crises over several decades , most particularly the wars in @entity97 and @entity98 , " @entity16 said after his death last month			1
" he could always be counted on for his imagination , dedication and forcefulness			1
" after @entity11 took office in 2008 , @entity4 took one of the toughest diplomatic assignments -- @entity5 special representative for @entity69 and @entity18 , the region the president regards as critical to the fight against terrorism			1
@entity4 's assertive style worked in the @entity111 , but it brought perils for diplomats in @entity69 and @entity18 , where long stretches of chatting and tea - drinking are the norm			1
he was frank in his assessments about the region and officials in both countries regarded him as abrasive , including @entity69 president @entity122			2
in april 2009 , there were reports of a heated argument between @entity4 and @entity122 after charges of fraud surfaced in the @entity69 presidential election			1
@entity122 's office issued a statement that described @entity4 as " a veteran and seasoned diplomat who had served greatly to the government and the people of the @entity5			1

" " we are determined to see it through , " he said , and he made reference to the @entity81 and the @entity72 in his comments			0
he noted that dealing with so many foes on both sides of the @entity69 - @entity18 border made the process difficult			0
" a peace deal requires agreements , and you do n't make agreements with your friends , you make agreements with your enemies , " he said			0
@entity4 mentioned a range of militant groups , such as the @entity69 @entity83 , the @entity18 @entity83 , the @entity162 , and @entity163 , and noted that " an expert could add another 30			1
" " there 's no @entity166			0
there is a widely dispersed group of people that we roughly call the enemy			0
there 's @entity84 , with which there 's no possibility of any discussion at all			0
" " there is no clear single address that you go to , " he said .			0
