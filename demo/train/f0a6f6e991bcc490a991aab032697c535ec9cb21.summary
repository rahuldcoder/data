-- as you celebrate the holiday season , make time to see @entity3 's brilliant new film , " @entity4			1
" the movie is a riveting story , filmed in black and white , about an elderly man named @entity8 ( played by @entity9 ) who takes a road trip with his youngest son , @entity11 ( played by @entity12 )			2
the two of them drive from @entity15 , @entity16 , to @entity17 , @entity4			1
@entity8 , an alcoholic who has lived a hard life , is convinced that he has won a million dollars based on a letter from a company that sells magazine subscriptions			2
@entity11 tries to explain to his gruff father that the letter is simply a ploy to convince him to purchase subscriptions			2
the father is determined , and desperate , to claim the prize			2
with a kind heart , @entity11 ends up taking his dad on the trip to play out his dream			0
throughout the film , viewers see a landscape that is visually beautiful and economically devastating			2
the two travel through towns that are aging and fading , where almost every character is struggling to make ends meet			2
indeed , the fact that @entity8 is depending on this kind of letter to find fortune is in itself a devastating statement about what has become of the @entity45 dream			1
@entity11 , a struggling salesman in the audio and electronics business , at one point asks what his father would actually do with a million dollars			2
it turns out that all @entity8 really wants is a new truck and an air compressor			0
that 's the limit of his aspirations			0
he ca n't even dream of anything more or of a better way to obtain it			0
the movie is a powerful statement about the economic challenges that face so many @entity45 who live in , or on the verge of , poverty			1
one of the greatest tragedies of the current political era is that neither party has been doing much to make things better			0
like @entity8 , many @entity45 cling on for their economic lives , daring to dream based on the flimsiest of opportunities			1
while the @entity45 dream once revolved around making your way up through a union job , selling products to consumers or starting a small business , today for many @entity45 that dream has come down to hoping to win sweepstakes , contests that are doomed to disappoint almost everyone			1
in this context , it 's remarkable that in recent years , many @entity82 have actually threatened to make things more difficult in these communities			0
besides the fact that the national @entity82 has not supported any kind of substantive policies to invest in certain regions to kick start economic growth , congressional @entity82 have launched an all - out assault on the social safety net			1
the @entity93 @entity82 , for example , has pushed for a reduction in food stamps , one of the most important benefits upon which millions of @entity45 have depended since the 1960s			1
rep. @entity99 of @entity100 has called for a conservative @entity101 that relies on private markets , voluntarism and vouchers to help the poor while he simultaneously promotes stringent budget cuts in nondefense spending that would weaken government support systems such as food stamps or the @entity110			0
@entity82 have pushed for major reductions in programs such as @entity113 and @entity114			0
many @entity82 governors are continuing to reject the expanded @entity117 funding in the @entity118 , which would be hugely beneficial to the poor and working poor			0
there are many more democrats who are clearly interested in using government to tackle some of the conditions with which the characters in " @entity4 " have to cope , though the actual programs they seek to put into place remain unclear ( outside of the @entity118 , which is hugely significant )			1
president @entity129 delivered a speech last week on economic inequality , calling on politicians to do more to address the issue , which he characterized as the " defining challenge of our time			1
" the president called on @entity138 to pass legislation strengthening unions , raising the minimum wage , reducing the gender pay gap and making college more affordable			0
but until now , there has been little movement during by the @entity129 @entity93 to deal with these kinds of structural economic problems			1
@entity129 has also faced fierce opposition whenever he raises these issues			1
many @entity121 assume that tackling poverty is politically impossible today , so they invest more energy in programs that will win them votes in prosperous suburban communities			0
the nation ca n't afford to continue along this path			0
fifty years ago next year , president @entity158 and the 88th @entity138 launched a @entity101 that committed government funding and created an agency to help impoverished @entity45 become self - sufficient and restore their communities			1
for over a decade , the program had many beneficial effects and played a role in diminishing the number of people living under the worst economic conditions			0
a recent paper from the @entity170 showed how government supports created since the @entity172 lift millions of @entity45 out of poverty			1
in 2011 , the paper found , the @entity110 and the @entity175 rescued 9.4 million people from the grasp of poverty			0
to be sure , the @entity101 suffered from many shortcomings			0
the funding for the programs was always meager compared with the inflated promises that came from elected officials			0
some of the programs created huge friction among @entity121 as local politicians did n't like what community activists did with federal money that was out of their control			2
conservatives have also railed against the unintended consequences of the programs , claiming they made recipients dependent on government			0
regardless of the criticism , this was a period when the federal government tried to do something			0
importantly , it was not just liberals who were behind these programs , but also conservatives such as @entity204 democrat @entity203 of @entity205 , who sponsored the @entity206 of 1964 in the @entity93			1
the time has come to focus our attention on the issue of systematic poverty once again , to make sure that we move the nation on a path toward a better @entity214 in @entity4			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			1
