-- @entity1 triumphed in one of @entity4 's classic matches and @entity5 subdued the challenge of a young upstart friday to set up a dream final showdown at the grass court grand slam			1
@entity11 needed four hours 43 minutes , the longest men 's singles semifinal in the tournament 's history , to beat @entity16 's @entity15 , 7 - 5 4 - 6 7 - 6 6 - 7 6 - 3			1
home favorite and second seed @entity5 won a gripping , but at times controversial , last four clash with @entity22 's @entity21 , 6 - 7 6 - 4 6 - 4 6 - 3 to join him in the title match			1
it will be their fourth clash in a grand slam final , the last won by @entity1 in the @entity26 earlier this year			2
the top seed was involved in the match of the tournament , marked by breathtaking and grueling rallies , none more so than when @entity1 had the first of his chances to win as he led 6 - 4 in the fourth set tiebreak , holding two match points			1
an incredible 24 - shot exchange ended with @entity1 hitting long and former @entity38 champion @entity15 took advantage to win the next three points , including the second match point , to force the decider			1
the pace was unrelenting and @entity15 finally cracked in the eighth game , conceding his service to leave 2011 champion @entity1 to serve for his place in the final			2
@entity15 was still not finished and forced a break point , but @entity1 was not to be denied and closed out victory on his third match point with a backhand winner			2
" it was one of the best matches i have been part of , one of the most exciting , it was so close , " he told @entity53			0
" that 's why he 's a grand slam champion , he came up with some unbelievable shots " i 'm very proud to go through			0
when i lost the fourth set of course it was disappointing because i was close to winning and did n't capitalize			0
" he came up with some big forehands			0
it was a very high level of tennis , " he added			0
@entity15 , apparently nursing an injury , had beaten @entity1 in the @entity68 bronze medal match on @entity4 grass , and sensed another upset			1
after @entity1 took the first set on a single break of service in the 12th game , eighth seed @entity15 hit back to level by claiming his opponent 's service for the first time			2
the third set was again played at a high intensity and @entity1 had three points to take it as he led 6 - 5 , but again @entity15 responded to force a tiebreak			1
@entity1 moved ahead again by dominating it for the loss of just two points and when he broke to lead 4 - 3 in the fourth it looked all over			1
but that was to underestimate @entity15 and in the next game he bravely leveled before his tiebreak heroics which will be long remembered			0
long wait all the time @entity5 and his 24th seeded opponent @entity21 were waiting and by the time they emerged on @entity96 it was early evening			2
the 22 - year - old @entity21 signaled he was not going to roll over with confident play in the first set and when it went to the tiebreak he took control to win it 7 - 2			1
@entity5 gained the early break in the second set and eventually leveled at one set apiece			0
but with @entity21 again powering ahead to 4 - 1 in the third set , the alarm bells were ringing for the @entity106			1
but showing great character and finally inspiring the crowd into raucous mood , he blasted through the next five games to take the set			0
with light fading and following continuous complaints from @entity21 , referee @entity112 ordered the roof to be closed , meaning a delay of 20 minutes			0
@entity117 @entity5 , with the momentum behind him , was outraged and loudly complained to the officials -- " that 's not fair , " he said			0
he later revealed that @entity21 , who has soared up the rankings since reaching last year 's @entity124 final , had spent the delay making a mobile phone call			2
" he seemed very relaxed			0
that 's the sort of player he is , that 's why he is very loose on the court , " was @entity5 's verdict			0
when they emerged for the second time , @entity5 almost immediately broke @entity21 's service and saw it through to the finish , winning with a whipped forehand to reach his second straight @entity4 final .			1

@entity140 's @entity1 to play @entity5 in @entity4 final
@entity1 beats @entity15 in *marathon* semifinal
@entity145 wins 7 - 5 4 - 6 7 - 6 6 - 7 6 - 3 in four hours 43 minutes
home hope @entity5 needs four sets to beat @entity21
