@entity1 's military said wednesday that 80 % of @entity1 armed forces have now pulled out of a strategic railroad hub that 's been the focus of bitter fighting with @entity8 separatists			1
the two sides have been battling for weeks for control of @entity12 , and continued conflict there has undermined a truce that apparently went into effect sunday , raising concerns it is all but dead			1
the ramifications for the @entity19 are huge because the 10 - month - long conflict in eastern @entity1 has hiked tensions with @entity22 to a level not seen since the end of the @entity25 , affecting trade and raising the specter of @entity22 expansion into @entity29			1
@entity2 's @entity30 called the loss of debaltseve a huge blow to the @entity1 government and a win for the separatist militants , who regarded it already as their territory when the front lines for the ceasefire were drawn			1
it 's not yet clear how @entity41 will respond			2
@entity1 president @entity43 , in a taped statement , said @entity1 armed forces in the area had left @entity12 according to plan and that @entity41 was waiting for two remaining columns to pull back to the new defensive line			1
" @entity12 was under our control , there was no encirclement , and our troops left the area in a planned and organized manner with all the heavy weaponry , " he said , according to his office			1
@entity43 said in his conversations with @entity60 and @entity61 leaders he had called for " a firm reaction from the world to @entity22 's brutal violation of the @entity66 agreements , " referring to the ceasefire agreed upon in @entity68			1
the president , wearing a camouflage jacket , said he was on his way to the front line to meet with some of the soldiers who have pulled back			2
" i will be honored to shake their hands , " he said			0
@entity1 defense spokesman @entity76 told a @entity41 news conference that the " organized retreat " from @entity12 should be complete " within hours			1
" the official news agency of the self - proclaimed @entity80 , @entity81 , earlier quoted separatists as saying there had been a large handover of weapons to the separatist forces in @entity12			1
@entity2 's @entity30 , who is near @entity12 , said deserted roads in the area are strewn with the wreckage of what , only hours earlier , were @entity1 military positions			1
a @entity2 team passed a checkpoint that had been obliterated as well as an armored personnel carrier that seemed to have been hit by a large explosion			0
what appeared to be the bodies of two @entity1 soldiers could be seen there			1
only kilometers away from @entity12 , the kind of intense shelling that would be expected with bitter fighting could no longer be heard			2
it 's not clear where the civilians who were trapped by the conflict will go now , @entity30 said			2
the separatists have said they may try to evacuate them later , he said , but they would have to pass through areas that are still contested			0
speaking after news of the withdrawal , @entity109 secretary general @entity108 urged @entity22 to withdraw its forces from eastern @entity1			1
" i urge @entity22 to withdraw all its forces from eastern @entity1 , to stop all its support for the separatists and to respect the @entity66 agreement ... and to also use all its influence on the separatists to make them respect the ceasefire , " he told reporters in @entity114 , @entity115			1
@entity22 has steadfastly denied allegations by @entity41 and the @entity19 that it is sending heavy weaponry and troops over the border into eastern @entity1			1
@entity22 foreign minister @entity128 told a news conference in @entity130 that @entity22 president @entity131 had tried to highlight the danger to thousands of @entity1 troops encircled in @entity12 before the ceasefire agreement was signed , but that @entity43 had denied they were trapped			1
the main goal now must be to save the troops ' lives , he said			0
@entity128 suggested that outside @entity12 , the weekend ceasefire had taken hold			2
" across all conflict lines we can see hostilities have ceased and heavy armor started to be moved , " he said			0
he urged @entity41 and the @entity19 not to try to use the situation in @entity12 as " an excuse to derail the process , " saying such reasoning had been used in the past to hinder peace efforts			2
the @entity151 , which is tasked with monitoring the ceasefire and a supposed withdrawal of heavy weapons by both sides to create a buffer zone , has not been able to gain access to @entity12 because of the continued conflict			2
the chief monitor of the @entity151 monitoring mission in @entity1 , @entity161 , said tuesday that he was " profoundly disturbed " by reports from the town			1
his monitors plan to try to gain access again wednesday			0
" i am especially concerned about the civilian population of the town , " @entity161 said			0
" the sides have a duty to them as well and to each other to adhere strictly to the ceasefire			0
" i condemn any attempts to create new facts on the ground , and so to change the basis on which the latest package of measures has been agreed			0
" he pointed the finger at the separatist leaders in @entity179 and @entity180 , saying that they had effectively denied the @entity151 monitors access to @entity12 , and urged them to end their offensive and allow " unfettered access			2
" @entity61 foreign policy chief @entity184 said wednesday that the separatists ' actions in @entity12 were " a clear violation of the ceasefire " and called for the @entity151 observers to be allowed in			1
" the separatists must stop all military activities			2
@entity22 and the separatists have to immediately and fully implement the commitments agreed to in @entity66 , " she said			2
" the @entity61 stands ready to take appropriate action in case the fighting and other negative developments in violation of the @entity66 agreements continue			0
" diplomats in @entity201 scrambled tuesday to shore up the shaky ceasefire agreement , hammered out by the leaders of @entity1 , @entity22 , @entity204 and @entity205 last week in @entity66			1
the @entity206 unanimously approved a resolution calling on all parties to abide by the truce , and issued a statement expressing " grave concern at the continued fighting in and around @entity12 , @entity1 , which has resulted in numerous civilian casualties			1
" in a call with @entity43 , @entity60 vice president @entity214 warned that if @entity22 continues to violate the @entity66 agreements , " the costs to @entity22 will rise , " according to a @entity217 statement			2
@entity128 dismissed @entity214 's words as " just another example of how the @entity60 position is not constructive			0
" in the beleaguered village of @entity224 , @entity1 forces are struggling to keep control of territory			1
mortar shelling and small arms battles broke out in @entity224 on wednesday morning			0
two @entity1 soldiers were injured , @entity229 , a spokesman for @entity1 's army in the @entity232 sector , told @entity2			1
" right now , only about a third of the village is under our control , " a machine gunner named @entity235 told @entity2 's @entity236 a day earlier			0
@entity240 , commander of @entity1 's @entity242 battalion , said the ceasefire " is a farce			1
" " the fighting is continuing now the way it did before , " @entity240 told @entity245			0
" they continue to attack us , shell us ; they use artillery , mortars			0
" but it 's impossible to tell which side is responsible for breaking the ceasefire in @entity224			0
to some residents , it does n't matter			0
" the fighting is very heavy			0
all the windows ( of ) our house are broken , " one woman said			0
" it is very terrifying			0
we saved all our lives to buy our house , and now we have nothing			0
" @entity2 's @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity272 contributed to this report , as did journalists @entity274 and @entity276 .			0
