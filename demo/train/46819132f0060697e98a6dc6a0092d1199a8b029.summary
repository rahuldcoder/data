-- after months of turmoil in @entity4 's financial markets , @entity1 has an opportunity to do something that just a few weeks ago would have seemed incomprehensible -- knock @entity7 out of the @entity8			1
not the single currency , of course , but @entity11 -- the competition that pits the continent 's best soccer teams against each other			1
friday 's quarterfinal clash is being heralded as the ultimate grudge match after months of wrangling over the future of @entity4 's economy , and @entity7 's insistence on sweeping austerity measures in @entity1 after providing the bulk of its bailout money			1
though the recent rivalry has been provoked by matters of finance , the suffering endured during @entity29 occupation in @entity30 has left many @entity1 with strong @entity32 feelings			2
it is far from the first time political and sporting lines have become blurred , even in the current @entity37 tournament			0
economic turmoil has ' affected ' @entity1 at @entity11 @entity40 's group match with @entity41 last week provoked running battles on the streets of @entity44 as fans from both nations transported historical tensions to the modern day			1
@entity49 started after city officials sanctioned a @entity41 national day march before the game			0
@entity53 's @entity41 occupied @entity40 shortly after the outbreak of @entity30 , and the communist regime 's influence extended for many years			0
even inside the @entity58 last tuesday , away fans unfurled a banner that read " this is @entity41 " -- infuriating @entity40 supporters			0
perhaps the most notorious case of football fanning the flames of political dispute came when a @entity67 qualification clash between @entity68 and @entity69 sparked a four - day war in 1969			1
the @entity72 neighbors had been at odds over issues of migration and land reform , and the two legs prompted angry clashes between fans			0

four days later a ceasefire deal was clinched			0
at the @entity67 in 1998 , the @entity88 and @entity89 met in a combustible fixture that those involved claimed did more for relations between the two countries than 20 years of infrequent political dialogue			0
a 2008 clash between @entity96 had to be contested in @entity97 after the @entity98 refused to play its neighbor 's anthem or fly its flag before the @entity67 qualifier			2
after the return game in @entity106 in 2009 , the @entity104 's victory was followed by the @entity98 's accusations of tactical food poisoning			2
perhaps the most politically - charged games of football ever to take place came in 1974 when @entity7 met @entity112 at the @entity67			1
the nation was still divided after @entity30 , and proved the staging post for years of @entity116 tensions between @entity41 and the @entity112			2
@entity7 forward @entity117 scored the only goal of the game but @entity112 had the last laugh , going on to win the tournament on home soil			1
@entity7 's games against the @entity124 also prove to be a hotbed of hostility , which has its roots in @entity30 and @entity29 occupation			1
former @entity130 coach @entity129 summed up the rivalry between the two nations prior to their 1974 @entity67 final clash when he said " football is war			2
" midfielder @entity136 went one step further , reportedly saying : " i do n't like @entity138			0
every time i played against @entity138 players			0
i had a problem because of the war			0
" war was also the backdrop for @entity146 's meeting with @entity147 in the 1986 @entity67 , coming just four years after the countries had finished fighting in the @entity150			1
the match was immortalized forever by @entity153 's handball goal , which he later said was scored by the " @entity154			2
" he claimed in his autobiography the goal was revenge for the @entity150 conflict in 1982 , when @entity159 bombarded the islands after @entity147 's invasion and occupation of the disputed territory			1
the fledgling nations of @entity165 and @entity166 clashed on the pitch and in the stands when they met in 2008 just a few years after the end of a brutal war			0
