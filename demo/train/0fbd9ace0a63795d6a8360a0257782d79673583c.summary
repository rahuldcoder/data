so grab a cool drink , find some shade and dive in			2
' @entity22 ' by @entity23 ambitious readers who take their prose seriously should grab a copy of " @entity22 , " a stunning work of historical fiction by @entity23			1
scores of critics are gushing over the book calling it epic , one of the best of the year , even an @entity36 classic			1
@entity23 certainly aims high , with his multigenerational tale of a formidable @entity39 family			1
the saga begins in the early 1800s and spans most of the 19th and 20th century , jumping back and forth in time and between several points of view among members of the @entity46 clan			2
there 's @entity48 , captured as a teenager in a brutal @entity51 attack and raised by a tribe of @entity53 ; @entity48 's son , @entity55 , a rancher caught between the @entity58 - @entity36 and white settlers who struggle for control of the land ; and @entity61 , @entity48 's great - granddaughter , an oil tycoon and matriarch for the modern era			1
while the novel is rich in detail in the history of @entity39 , this is a story of courage , conviction and perseverance that would feel at home almost anywhere in the @entity75			2
@entity23 's writing echoes some iconic @entity78 wordsmiths			1
" @entity22 " is at times violent and dark , like @entity79 , vividly character driven like @entity80 and panoramic in its scope , like @entity83 , appropriate considering @entity23 was a @entity83 fellow at the @entity84			1
read the first chapter of " @entity22 " ' a serpent 's tooth ' by @entity88 no less authentic is @entity88 's hero in a ten - gallon hat , @entity89			1
the sheriff of the fictional @entity92 , @entity93 , returns in his ninth mystery , " @entity95			2
" since its inception , the best - selling series has continued to grow globally in popularity and is now a hit on cable tv , just beginning its second season			2
in this latest adventure in print , @entity89 's search for a missing girl leads him to a @entity107 " lost boy , " a family of heavily armed polygamists and a @entity111 plot involving an interstate oil pipeline only a stone 's throw from the original @entity115			2
while the plot sounds a bit convoluted , @entity88 's writing is not			2
the story moves at a brisk pace , with room for some good - natured humor and plenty of gorgeous @entity93 scenery			0
but the real stars of the series are @entity89 and his supporting cast , his second - in - command , deputy @entity129 , with whom he shares a budding romance , and of course , his best friend and sometimes conscience , @entity133			0
for fans of the series , these three are like old friends whom you look forward to spending time with			0
inevitably , once the story is finished , readers will find themselves already looking forward to @entity89 's next visit			1
read more about " a @entity95 " on the author 's website and read an excerpt from the book ' @entity146 ' by @entity147 the summer 's most buzzed - about book may be @entity147 ' " @entity146 , " a high - concept thriller borrowing elements from several genres , including mystery , sci - fi and horror			1
lucky readers who got their hands on the novel early describe it as " @entity158 " meets " @entity162 , " but there 's more depth to this imaginative story			1
here 's the setup : in depression - era @entity165 , a serial killer finds a mysterious house that opens doors to other times			0
the killer uses this house of horrors to hunt his victims , all promising young women , across different decades until one victim survives			0
she then turns the tables , and the victim hunts the hunter			0
it 's a creepy concept , and @entity147 makes the far - fetched seem plausible thanks to her exceptional writing			0
critics , booksellers and some well - known novelists are singing the novel 's praises			1
it 's also captured @entity189 's attention			0
@entity190 and the producers behind @entity192 hit " @entity197 " just optioned the book , with plans to bring it to tv			0
it 's easy to understand why , because once you start reading , you will be hard - pressed to put down " @entity146			0
" read an excerpt from " @entity146 " ' @entity201 ' by @entity202 @entity202 , quite possibly the world 's best - selling writer , reteams with pulp fiction publisher @entity204 for his new paperback thriller , " @entity201			1
" but do n't be thrown by the tawdry cover featuring a buxom redhead ; this is classic king			1
it 's a murder mystery with a ghostly twist			0
in 1973 small - town @entity213 , @entity212 is a heartbroken college student who takes a summer job working at the local amusement park			1
@entity202 has loaded the story with lots of " carny " language , much of it authentic , some of it invented			1
for instance , did you know a shooting gallery is called a " bang shy " in carnival speak ? when he 's not running the @entity230 spin ride or pushing a popcorn wagon , @entity212 is intrigued by a local legend			0
turns out @entity201 's haunted house is truly haunted by the ghost of a young woman , murdered on the ride years before			0
with the help of a few fellow carny friends , @entity212 sets out to find the killer			0
along the way , he meets a little boy suffering from a terminal illness , who may be able to help him with the more otherworldly aspects of this mystery			0
while the story is at times dark and intense , there 's less of @entity202 's trademark horror and more of the wistful nostalgia and emotion that will remind fans of " @entity252 " and " @entity253 , " especially for its bittersweet and moving conclusion			1
read an excerpt from " @entity201 " ' @entity256 ' by @entity257 we turn from mystery to myth in @entity257 's " @entity256			1
" the book hits stores june 18 , and the author 's scores of fans are champing at the bit			1
the prolific @entity267 writer has penned award - winning children 's stories , such as " @entity270 , " films including the animated " @entity272 , " the hugely popular " @entity274 " graphic novels and even a recent episode of " @entity278 , " but @entity257 has n't written a true novel for adults since 2005			1
the book can be read easily in an afternoon , and it 's well worth the wait			2
an unnamed narrator visits his childhood home in @entity283 , @entity284 , to attend a funeral when he 's drawn into a forgotten memory of his youth			0
hazy details start to take shape , a farmhouse at the end of the lane , a duck pond , an odd little girl who was once a friend , her mother and grandmother , all three who may be more than they reveal			0
while exploring the countryside , the two young friends encounter something dark and menacing that follows them home , and a life and death battle begins			0
the story could be called something of a distant cousin to @entity307 , but @entity257 's novel is more about myth than magic			1
his narrator says at one point , " i liked myths			0
they were n't adult stories and they were n't children 's stories			0
they were better than that			0
" while that succinctly sums up the book , even more so , this is a rich story beautifully told about memory , innocence and a longing for the way things were when we were younger			0
