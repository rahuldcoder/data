in 16 years , cancer will become the leading cause of death in the @entity3 , surpassing heart disease , according to a new report from the @entity6			1
the number of new cancer cases is expected to increase nearly 45 % by 2030 , from 1.6 million cases to 2.3 million cases annually			1
this influx of new patients will place a bigger burden on a field of medicine already stretched by physician shortages and financial difficulties , says the report , which highlights growing problems for cancer care in the @entity3			1
dr. @entity20 knows these issues well			0
when he joined a community oncology practice in @entity24 , it had three doctors			1
a few years later the group merged with another practice , and connected with a national network of community doctors that enabled them to invest in new technologies and receive group discounts on cancer drugs			1
in return , they paid a percentage of their practice 's profit to the network			0
over time , the doctors ' profit margins became slimmer			0
they could n't compete with hospitals in the area for radiation therapy and other services that would have diversified their practice , and insurers had the upper hand in contract negotiations			2
it became obvious , as @entity20 said , " that 0 % of zero would be zero			2
" so @entity20 and his colleagues decided to leave the community oncology network and join a large hospital system in @entity24			1
nearly two - thirds of the small oncology practices surveyed said they were likely to merge , sell or close in the upcoming year , according to the oncology group 's inaugural report , " @entity59 in @entity3			1
" and as community practices disappear , patients are paying more and traveling farther for quality care			1
" if you ca n't get care , you ca n't get good care , " said @entity6 president dr. @entity63 , chief of @entity64 at @entity65 and a professor at @entity67			0
who : imminent global cancer " disaster " adding to the burden will be an increase in the number of cancer survivors			1
fifty years ago , only a handful of " minimally effective " treatments for cancer existed , according to the report			1
today , there are more than 170 @entity84 - approved anti-cancer drugs			0
two - thirds of @entity3 now live at least five years after a cancer diagnosis , up from about half in the 1970s , the report authors write			1
survivors need ongoing care , as they 're at higher risk for other types of cancer and conditions such as diabetes , cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis			2
the @entity98 will also increase the need for oncologists , as millions of @entity3 get newly covered by health insurance			1
taking these future patients into consideration , the oncology society expects demand for oncology services to grow 42 % by 2030			1
yet the number of oncologists is expected to grow only 28 % , leading to a shortage of more than 1,400 physicians			1
a large part of this is because of the aging physician population , according to the report			2
in 2008 , the proportion of oncologists older than 64 surpassed the proportion younger than 40 for the first time			0
a large number of communities in central and @entity121 states are covered solely by these older doctors			2
when they retire , more patients will have to travel farther to find care			1
" the shortage of oncologists is a real problem , " said dr. @entity125 , chief medical officer of the @entity126			0
" many smaller practices actually provide a lot of uncompensated care to those who do not have insurance or have insurance that does not pay well			1
" the report also highlights the need to lower costs , for both doctors and patients			1
right now , the system is designed to compensate doctors for how much they do , rather than how well they do it			0
that goes against the oncology society 's recommendations , which encourage physicians to avoid performing unnecessary tests and treatments			2
" one of the reasons that so many patients are harmed in medicine is they are over-treated , " @entity125 said			2
how doctors do harm drug prices are another big concern			0
when @entity20 started practicing , the average cancer drug cost $ 1,000 per month			2
today , he said , the average is $ 10,000 per month			0
" if we do n't begin to control these prices in one way or another , in 20 more years , the average cost of a cancer drug will be $ 100,000			2
that 's not sustainable , " he said			0
" twenty percent copay on $ 10,000 ( per month ) is not in the pocketbook for most of my patients			0
" @entity125 said price is one of the biggest reasons there is such a disparity in cancer outcomes ; research shows minorities are more likely to develop cancer and more likely to die from cancer			0
to combat some of the issues raised in the report and improve patient care , the society is working on several projects involving " big data			0
" these projects will help physicians " distill massive volumes of data into meaningful information , " according to the report authors			0
" medicine has lagged behind the rest of society in adopting and benefiting from these remarkable and ubiquitous technological improvements , " @entity63 said			0
@entity201 is an electronic health system that will collect and analyze data from millions of patients and provide feedback to providers in terms of standards of care and best practices			1
its goal , @entity63 said , is to prevent mistakes before they happen			0
" i 'd rather have a doctor who avoids mistakes than one who learns from them , " he said			0
the oncology society said it expects to roll out some components of the system in early 2015			0
most cancer cases are preventable			2
