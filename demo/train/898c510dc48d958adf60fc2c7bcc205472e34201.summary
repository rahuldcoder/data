-- amid the current tension along the @entity1 - @entity4 border , @entity1 has seemingly surrendered its initial reluctance to take a more proactive stance against the @entity7 ( @entity8 )			1
more than 150,000 mostly @entity10 refugees have crossed the border into @entity1 in recent days , fleeing the @entity13 's advance on the @entity4 border town of @entity15			2
as @entity8 mortar and artillery shells have repeatedly hit @entity1 soil , the government in @entity17 seems to have realized that it can not divorce itself from the negative spill - over effects of the international coalition 's war against the self - proclaimed caliphate			1
the release of @entity1 diplomats who had been held hostage by @entity8 in @entity29 for three months leaves @entity1 free to reevaluate its strategy towards the jihadist terror regime to the south			1
@entity1 infantry and tanks have taken up position along the border with @entity4 waiting for a go - ahead from @entity17 where @entity38 voted on thursday to provide the @entity1 government with a mandate to militarily engage @entity8 -- if necessary with boots on the ground			1
the question now is whether @entity1 armed forces can be the strategic game - changer in the international coalition 's war against @entity8			1
ever since his return from the @entity50 in @entity51 last week , @entity1 president @entity48 has been campaigning for the establishment of a safe haven in @entity4 and @entity54			1
it would both provide a place of refuge for @entity10 now stranded in @entity1 as well as create a buffer zone to keep hostilities at bay			0
@entity1 's potentially costly intervention would hardly be altruistic then			1
it would not seek to drive @entity8 out of its @entity4 and @entity64 heartland			0
rather , military intervention would create a safe haven similar to the one created in @entity54 after the @entity67 -- this time around hopefully patrolled and secured not just by air power but by actual soldiers			1
it would relieve pressure from @entity1 's border regions allowing @entity10 refugees and armed volunteers to return to their homes further south			1
at the same time , it would enable @entity1 to galvanize her control over @entity10 heartlands , which given the local state of anarchy , have become fertile grounds for the growth of @entity10 insurgency			0
unlike the @entity87 contributions to the @entity89 - led coalition , @entity1 's contribution will add more than just legitimacy			2
a joint military operation with capable air and land components would be able to expel the @entity13 from their current positions not just seizing but most importantly holding territory			0
due to their @entity99 training , @entity1 boots on ground would be able to provide the much - needed integrated forward air controlling capability to partners in the air			0
it would facilitate reconnaissance and target acquisition increasing the effectiveness of air strikes while minimizing their collateral damage			0
further , @entity1 bases geographically nearer the coalition 's area of operation would increase the flight time for coalition aircrafts currently based in the @entity116			0
aircrafts could remain in the air for longer and react to changing realities on the ground much quicker			0
yet , both strategically and operationally , a mere military commitment by @entity1 to @entity4 and @entity54 , will not be the panacea for the underlying socio - political maladies that made the rise of @entity8 possible			1
from a strategic point of view , there is no sole military solution to jihadist fundamentalism in the region without a comprehensive regional effort to target the socio - political root causes that have fueled insurgency in @entity54 since 2003 and in @entity4 since 2011			0
from a military operational point of view , the establishment of safe havens even when enforced by @entity1 ground troops , would always be an operation with limited scope			2
it is highly unlikely that @entity1 forces would advance deep into the jihadists ' heartland around @entity145 or @entity29 , leaving @entity8 with enough space to maneuver			1
and as a hybrid fighting force , @entity8 has proven to be highly adaptive and flexible in its operational approaches			0
since @entity89 air strikes commenced more than six weeks ago , its @entity13 have relied more heavily on dynamic non-linear advances by infantry often in the cover of civilian environments			0
a conventional military approach with limited scope as envisaged by the @entity1 military will find it hard to defeat @entity8 on its own turf -- even with boots on the ground			2
while @entity1 boots on the ground can bring about a short to mid-term relief in @entity164 , they will not be the strategic game - changer in @entity4 and @entity54 , single - handedly solving a socio - political problem by military means			2
@entity1 boots on the ground are no alternative then to proxies with local social bases who would be jointly trained , equipped and empowered by @entity87 and @entity174 partners -- proxies who could not only effectively undermine @entity8 ' centers of gravity but also herald the socio - political changes necessary for building sustainable security and stability in the region .			0

@entity1 's @entity38 voted on thursday to authorize military action against @entity8
release of hostages by @entity8 leaves @entity1 free to reevaluate strategy , says @entity189
@entity189 : intervention would create safe haven like one created in @entity54 after @entity67
unlikely @entity1 forces would advance into jihadists ' heartland of @entity145 or @entity29 , he adds
