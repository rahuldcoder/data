@entity0 -- congressional negotiators reached a tentative deal tuesday to extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits while avoiding a fee cut for @entity8 doctors , according to @entity10 legislators and aides			1
the framework deal followed a key @entity10 concession monday and could receive the endorsement of a @entity17 - @entity16 conference committee on wednesday			1
@entity19 of @entity20 and @entity21 of @entity22 , both @entity23 who were part of the conference committee negotiations , called it a tentative agreement , while a top @entity17 @entity29 aide said @entity29 leaders would discuss the proposal with their members on wednesday morning			1
@entity19 and @entity21 said they expected the conference committee to sign off on the measure wednesday if no objections arise			0
in that case , the @entity17 would vote on the agreement , in the form of the conference committee report , as soon as friday			2
however , some conservative @entity41 expressed concerns about the potential agreement and said they were unsure if they would support it			0
other @entity17 legislators said they expected it to pass with support from a majority of @entity23 , as well as @entity29			2
" it 's the art of a deal			0
i mean , it 's a compromise , " said rep. @entity51 , @entity52			0
" so you have people that did n't get a 100 % of what they wanted			0
" under the agreement that would cover the rest of 2012 , the nearly $ 100 billion payroll tax cut would not be paid for -- a consequence of the parties ' inability to compromise on either new taxes or offsetting spending cuts , said top congressional aides from both parties			1
it would be coupled , however , with measures extending unemployment benefits and preventing a fee cut to @entity8 doctors -- known in @entity0 as the " doc fix			0
" the latter two measures -- costing a combined $ 50 billion -- would be paid for , the aides said			0
possible funding sources to pay for the measure include saving from broadband spectrum sales of about $ 13 billion , increased pension contributions by federal employees of about $ 16 billion and cuts to @entity8 hospital and specialist fees that would not impact patients , according to the congressional aides			0
" i think they have to work out all the details , but i think the big scope has been agreed to , " house speaker @entity86 , @entity52 , told reporters			0
however , @entity17 majority leader @entity91 , @entity92 , was less enthusiastic , saying " this is not our preferred way " to deal with the issues and adding that details were still being studied			2
congressional aides differed by party on details of extending the unemployment benefits , particularly the maximum number of weeks that will be funded			0
while a @entity29 aide said the maximum for states with high unemployment would continue at the current 99 weeks , a @entity10 aide said the maximum would be 89 weeks and most states would have a maximum of 63 weeks of benefits by the end of the year			2
some @entity23 wanted unemployed individuals to pass drug tests and meet certain education standards before getting benefits -- an idea generally opposed by @entity29			0
a top @entity10 aide said the tentative agreement would allow for states to conduct drug testing when the unemployment benefits applicant was seeking a job that required drug testing or lost a job due to a failed drug test			1
news of the tentative deal came hours after president @entity130 publicly urged @entity131 to extend the payroll tax cut , which is currently set to expire at the end of february			1
failure to do so , @entity130 warned , could derail the economic recovery			1
" this is a make - or - break moment for the middle class , " the president said			0
" the last thing we need is for @entity0 to stand in the way of @entity143 's comeback			0
" @entity145 press secretary @entity144 later told reporters that the payroll tax cut , extension of unemployment benefits and " doc fix " provision all were " important to the economy in different ways			1
" " it is of vital importance that @entity131 not muck up the recovery that we 're seeing under way , " @entity144 said of the need for a broad agreement			2
the payroll tax cut , unemployment benefits and enhanced " doc fix " payments are set to expire at the end of february under a short - term agreement reached by @entity131 in december			1
that agreement also set up the conference committee that resumed negotiations last month on a longer - term deal			0
final negotiations have been hammered out by the two committee chairman , @entity29 sen. @entity171 of @entity172 and @entity10 rep. @entity10 of @entity22 , in conjunction with senate majority leader @entity174 , @entity175 , and @entity86			2
the payroll tax cut , a key part of @entity130 's economic recovery plan , has reduced how much 160 million @entity143 workers pay into @entity180 on their first $ 110,100 in wages			1
instead of paying in 6.2 % , they 've been paying 4.2 % for the past year and two months			0
the break is worth about $ 83 a month for someone making $ 50,000			0
on monday , @entity17 @entity17 leaders dropped their demand that any extension of the tax cut be offset by spending cuts elsewhere in the budget			1
the decision was a sharp turnaround for @entity23 , who previously argued that a failure to fully pay for the tax break would be financially reckless			0
the debate over whether and how to extend the tax cut has been a political loser so far for the @entity41 , who had publicly questioned its value last year			1
@entity29 have gleefully highlighted the @entity17 's reluctance , using the issue to portray republicans as defenders of the rich who are indifferent to the plight of the middle class			2
political analysts believe the showdown over the payroll holiday has eroded @entity17 strength on the party 's core issue of lower taxes			1
fearing negative repercussions , @entity10 leaders have now backtracked on the issue twice : dropping their opposition to the two - month extension last december and dropping their insistence on paying for a longer extension on monday			2
" i think the @entity17 has read the writing on the wall when it comes to the payroll tax cut , " said @entity220 political scientist @entity219			1
" @entity143 are benefiting from it , and to take it away at this juncture leaves them open to charges of raising taxes			0
... it would severely hamper the @entity17 presidential nominee 's effort to defeat @entity130			2
" @entity234 political scientist @entity233 called the @entity17 's latest move " a subtle shift in strategy precipitated by the improving economic outlook of the past few weeks			1
" " by agreeing to a deal , the @entity17 can claim some credit for extending the holiday , " @entity233 said			2
" failing to extend the payroll tax would not only be unpopular , it would shift some of the responsibility for the economy back on the @entity41			1
this is to be avoided at all costs since the @entity17 ( election ) strategy rests almost entirely on @entity130 's handling of the economy			1
" in announcing their shift on the payroll tax issue monday , @entity86 and two other top @entity17 @entity17 leaders said they wanted separate the matter from legislation dealing with unemployment benefits and the doc fix			1
doing so would " protect small businesses and our economy from the consequences of @entity0 @entity29 ' political games , " said @entity86 , @entity91 and @entity259 @entity258 , @entity260			0
@entity219 told @entity1 the idea of divorcing the payroll tax cut from an unemployment benefits extension and the doc fix was a " clever " idea on the part of the @entity17 @entity17 leadership			1
doing so would have removed the @entity29 ' " leverage on the other issues of unemployment and @entity8 payments , " she said			0
" also , as the unemployment numbers get better , the rationale for a lengthy extension of benefits diminishes			0
the longer the @entity17 can stall on the unemployment extension , the more likely it is they win in terms of authorizing a much shorter extension than the @entity29 would like			2
" democrats , however , quickly pushed back hard against the idea			0
senate majority leader @entity174 , @entity287 , and @entity17 minority leader @entity288 , @entity289 , on tuesday urged @entity23 to allow @entity131 to quickly complete its work on all three issues -- the payroll tax cut , unemployment insurance , and the doc fix			1
@entity288 said @entity131 should cancel a recess currently scheduled for next week if it fails to complete work on all of them by friday			0
" these crucial policies affect millions of middle class families and seniors and must not expire at the end of this month , " @entity288 said			0
instead of a separate measure involving only the payroll tax cut extension , the tentative agreement tuesday was a more comprehensive package worked out by the conference committee negotiators it remains unclear if the increasingly conservative @entity17 @entity17 caucus will be willing to go along with the tentative deal			1
@entity17 @entity10 freshmen , elected on a tidal wave of tea party support in 2010 , have made deficit reduction their top priority and repeatedly insisted that any new initiatives be fully paid for			1
rep. @entity318 , @entity319 , said discussion tuesday night in the @entity17 @entity10 caucus was " heated " over not paying for the payroll tax cut extension , which he called " bad policy , " while fellow @entity322 rep. @entity322 , a tea party conservative , said " this does n't look like a good deal to me			1
" meanwhile , two @entity331 republicans , reps			0
@entity332 and @entity333 , sounded more supportive , with @entity333 saying he expected the measure to pass			0
one key conservative , rep. @entity336 of @entity337 , indicated tuesday he 's prepared to back @entity86 and the other @entity17 @entity17 leaders			2
@entity336 's " view is anytime we 're letting people keep more of their money , that 's a good thing , " said @entity339 , a spokesman for the @entity10 congressman			2
veteran political analyst @entity346 warned that the @entity17 leadership 's repeated maneuvering on the issue could end up backfiring			1
@entity17 @entity10 leaders have been " trying to make the best of crummy situation , " @entity346 told @entity1			1
but tea party @entity23 " do n't care " if fighting the tax cut extension is " a political loser			1
they do n't like the payroll tax cut and now the ( leadership 's ) sin is being compounded by saying they wo n't pay for it			1
" this " could play out in ways that make the life of @entity86 ( and other @entity10 leaders ) a little less comfortable , " he predicted			0
@entity366 's @entity365 and @entity1 's @entity367 and @entity368 contributed to this report			0
