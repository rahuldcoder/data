the @entity2 government 's long - stated position is that it wo n't negotiate with terrorists			1
but are there exceptions ? @entity7 sgt. @entity6 , an @entity2 prisoner of war , is believed to be held in @entity8 by the @entity9			1
the @entity9 is part of the larger @entity12 network and has engaged in a range of attacks on civilian targets in @entity16 , such as the @entity17 in @entity18			1
earlier this month , the @entity19 named three of the @entity9 's leaders as " @entity21 , " and noted that the organization " poses a grave threat to @entity2 civilians , military personnel , and our broader interests in the @entity16 - @entity8 region			1
" two years ago , the @entity29 also formally listed the @entity30 as a foreign terrorist organization			0
yet on monday , the @entity32 quoted @entity2 officials who said the government was going to resume talks with the @entity16 @entity12 and offer to trade five @entity12 prisoners held at the detention facility at @entity38 for @entity6 , who has been held since 2009			1
does that mean the @entity2 is negotiating with a terrorist group ? in fact , the @entity30 are part of the larger @entity16 @entity12 network , but the @entity16 @entity12 itself is not listed by the @entity29 as a foreign terrorist organization , which enables the @entity2 to have direct talks with the @entity16 @entity12 , which it has been doing for years secretly , according to multiple @entity2 officials familiar with the talks			1
this means that discussions about the release of @entity6 with the @entity16 @entity12 are not directly with a terrorist organization per se , but instead with an insurgent group that has a terrorist wing			1
for some this may seem to be a distinction without a difference , but as a matter of @entity2 policy this is a very important distinction			0
consider the case of another @entity2 who is held hostage in @entity8 , @entity62 , a contractor for the @entity2 @entity64 who was kidnapped by @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity8 , more than two years ago			2
in december , a proof - of - life video was released to international media outlets , in which @entity62 called on president @entity70 to negotiate for his release			0
as with @entity6 , the release of @entity38 detainees was among his captors ' conditions			0
@entity2 officials have called for @entity62 's release			0
but the @entity2 has never negotiated with @entity66 and would not want to encourage the group to kidnap other @entity2 living in @entity8 , so it seems out of the question that @entity2 officials would negotiate with @entity66 for @entity62 's release			2
that said , @entity2 officials will certainly be working behind the scenes to put pressure on the @entity8 government to try to secure @entity62 's release			0
the fact that @entity6 is being held by the @entity30 does raise another issue , however , which is : even if you get a deal with the @entity16 @entity12 for @entity6 's release , would the @entity30 , which operates quite independently from the @entity16 @entity12 , go along with it ? the consensus among @entity12 experts is , likely , yes			1
@entity91 , a fellow at the @entity92 who has interviewed multiple members of the @entity16 @entity12 and the @entity30 , says the @entity30 would honor such a deal because " they take great pains to present themselves as part of the mainstream @entity12 movement -- even if in practice they are independent -- and not going along would be an affront to the @entity12 , possibly damaging relations			2
" according to the @entity32 report , the @entity2 government has not yet made a formal offer for @entity6 , who has spent almost five years in captivity			2
but the political situation around @entity6 's release may be shifting slightly in favor of a resolution			0
in 2103 , the @entity70 administration quietly released 11 prisoners from @entity38 and it did n't generate much criticism from opponents of the administration			0
two months ago , @entity115 also eased up on some of the restrictions that had previously prevented prisoners being released from @entity38			0
also , @entity2 combat troops in @entity16 are pulling out at the end of december , which is , of course , a key @entity12 demand			1
this means , as both a practical and legal matter , that the @entity2 will then no longer be at war in @entity16 , although there will likely be some residual force of @entity2 soldiers in an advisory role post- 2014			2
when wars are over , the warring parties traditionally exchange their prisoners of war			0
with all @entity2 combat soldiers returning home from @entity16 during the course of this year , it is high time for @entity6 to be one of them .			1

@entity139 : the @entity2 wo n't negotiate with terrorists , but will it make an exception ?
sgt. @entity6 is believed to be held by the @entity9 , a terror wing of @entity12
@entity146 : talks would be held with @entity16 @entity12 , which is not directly a terrorist group
@entity146 : @entity2 combat troops leaving @entity16 , it 's time to swap pows , *including* @entity6
