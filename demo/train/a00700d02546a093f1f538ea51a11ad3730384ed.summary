-- smart , successful , funny and handsome			1
@entity1 seemed to have it all			1
and yet , today he is dead			1
apparently , by his own choice			1
but why ? what went wrong ? the joy , spontaneity and humor of @entity1 likely masked the daily torment he endured in his on - again - off - again struggle with depression			1
he made us laugh out here , but he was in pain in there			1
unfortunately , i know that pain			1
in his death , we have lost one of the most talented and creative spirits on the planet			1
still , his death by suicide should be a wake - up call for us all			1
it is to remind us that many of us are walking a fine line -- smiling on the outside while slowly dying on the inside			1
i did n't know @entity1 personally , so i am unable to speak with any certainty as to why he chose to end his life			1
but i have experienced that kind of torment and pain			2
for years , i , too , struggled with depression			1
and many days , i still do			2
complete coverage on @entity1 those who are suffering will do just about anything not to feel the pain anymore			1
and in those moments , their brains become their worst enemies			2
it often takes an outside force to provide light , to make sure those dark thoughts are n't , as in the case of @entity1 , our last thoughts			1
according to the @entity50 , suicide rates increased from 2000 to 2011 from 10.4 deaths per 100,000 to 12.3 deaths per 100,000			1
the rate of suicide is higher and rising among men			1
in 2011 , 78.5 % of suicides were by men , at a rate of 20.2 deaths per 100,000			2
the rate of suicide is rising in all age groups except 85 and older and is highest in individuals 45 to 64 , according to the @entity63			1
we know and feel that the stigma of mental health is making it even harder for those of us who need support to reach out and get it			1
living with depression is isolating and demoralizing and often reinforces the pain that we are in			1
we ca n't let these tragedies continue			2
the ripple effect is immeasurable			2
now , his loss has to change how we move forward			2
when someone dies , it is tragic			2
but when someone dies by suicide , there are so many competing emotions from all who are touched that there is no understanding the impact			1
we all wonder ' why ? ' no two lives are identical and to make judgments about another 's choice is often more destructive than helpful			2
but we have to remember that everyone is dealing with their own stuff behind their own mask			2
we do n't know what 's really going on , so we must be careful not to judge			2
too many are dying because of the deafening silence			2
everyone you know goes through or is going through the fire , and that 's the truth			2
for me , depression has been part of my journey for a very long time			1
long before i knew what to call it , there it was walking with me , side by side			2
there it was , holding my hand , invading my thoughts causing me to sleep longer , eat more and rarely smile whenever i spent time alone with myself			1
i learned to dance the dance , to smile for my friends , for my parents , for the audience , for the camera			2
i smiled , all while inside a hurricane was sweeping me into an ocean of darkness			0
we are all somehow very ashamed to admit to others our feelings of doom			0
there is no one size fits all reason for depression 's presence			1
for some it is childhood demons			0
for others , a chemical imbalance			0
it can be brought on by stressful situations or hang around forever in the background like a stubborn gray cloud			0
just as there is no single explanation for this emotional predator , there can be no one - size - fits - all solution			1
it starts with sharing and admitting the pain			0
nothing can be fixed until we admit that it is broken , until we acknowledge that there is a problem			0
from that point forward , we must work toward our healing solutions , because we are fighting for our life			0
my battle with depression has diminished greatly , although i 'm not sure that it will completely disappear			1
what i do know is that having it gone completely is a personal goal that i 've set and will continue to take whatever steps are necessary to accomplish it			0
writing my book " @entity164 : it just looks like we 're not hurting " was part of the journey			0
i wanted to help other people better understand what they were going through			0
now i 've co-founded with @entity170 the @entity171 to carry the mission forward			0
the mantra of the initiative , " @entity175 , @entity176			0
" how can we stop our best and brightest , our loved ones , from killing themselves when alone in that darkness ? how can we make a difference ? first , we have to take off the mask			0
we must begin to share our pain			0
by talking about it , everyone will realize that they are not alone			0
and they do not have to go through this journey alone			0
next , we must get involved and demand that our elected representatives support legislation that make resources available for everyone to get the support and help they need			0
lastly , we 've got to reach out to each other			0
when you see someone struggling , do n't just ignore them , write them off or assume they 'll just " snap out of it			0
" call them , visit them , keep an eye on them			0
have a cup of coffee and just listen			0
we all have a shared responsibility in the health and well - being of our society , one friend at a time			1
@entity1 ' death is a stark reminder to all of how much work there is to do			1
he was brilliant , and he brought joy to so many others			0
yet it seems that inner peace escaped him			0
but he is at peace now			0
still , those he left behind -- his family and friends -- are left to try to make sense of it			0
videos : the world according to @entity1 it might not ever make sense			1
you never really know what goes on inside someone 's head			0
we all wear a mask			0
