-- @entity1 has had three boxed sets devoted to his music			1
he 's been the subject of a tribute album			1
he 's constantly ranked among rock ' n ' roll 's greatest guitarists and finest songwriters by both the music press and fellow musicians			1
@entity1 says the focus of his career is his live work			1
top 40 hits are " kind of meaningless , " he said			2
for all that , the man 's highest - charting @entity25 album ( 1996 's " @entity22 ? " ) peaked at no. 97 on @entity17 's @entity16 chart , and the number of @entity20 singles he 's had stands at exactly zero			1
what does a legend have to do to get noticed by the mainstream ? @entity1 , 60 , brushes aside such hopes of breakout success			1
his focus is on live performance , he says in a phone interview			1
" i think the focus of what i do is really live work , " he said			1
" and i think if you persist in that , then slowly but surely , through word of mouth , the word gets out			2
and i continue to grow as a live performer			1
" still , for those who want a @entity1 primer before seeing him live -- he 'll be touring with @entity46 in the fall -- there 's that third boxed set , " @entity48 " ( @entity49 ) , which came out recently			1
the four - disc set compiles some of his best work with his old band @entity52 , his ex-wife @entity53 , and as a solo artist			1
the amiable @entity1 took some time to talk about putting together the new box , remaining outside the fray and what he thinks of " @entity58			1
" the following is an edited version of the interview			2
@entity0 : were you surprised another boxed set was in the offing ? @entity1 : this is more of an overview and perhaps a first - time buyers ' introduction kind of thing			1
it 's a greatest hits			1
if there were any hits			2
( chuckles ) @entity0 : does that bother you ? you 've never had , especially in the @entity76 , that kind of mainstream , top 40 success			1
@entity1 : you know , i think that 's kind of meaningless			1
certainly in the area in which i exist , i do n't think you need hits , necessarily -- though having said that , it would have been useful			2
i think the focus of what i do is really live work			1
and i think if you persist in that , then slowly but surely , through word of mouth , the word gets out			2
and i continue to grow as a live performer			1
more and more people come to shows , which is gratifying			0
i think the albums serve as a signpost , a reference point , but it 's not really the focus			2
@entity0 : you 've played professionally for more than 40 years			0
what were your goals when you started with @entity52 ? @entity1 : probably to survive			1
... we turned pro when i was 18			0
at that age , you do n't really think beyond about three months			0
so we were delighted and thrilled to be kind of earning a living from what we were doing			0
i think in the back of our minds , we thought , we 'll do this for a year or two years , and then it 's back to school , back to college and get a real job			2
and then it lasted for five years , [ though ] i still thought i 'd be going back to school at some point			0
and then 10 years , 15 -- i 'm still looking over my shoulder occasionally in disbelief that i managed to get away with it this long			0
it actually turned into a career			0
@entity0 : there are these themes -- tightropes , carnivals , the " @entity133 " -- that run through your songs			0
do you feel like you 're on a tightrope ? @entity1 : i think if you 're going to be an artist , you 're really supposed to be on the edge of society			1
your positions should , by definition , be precarious			0
it 's only when you 're out on the rim that you have the best view , that you have the perspective to see what society is			1
so i suppose i 'm kind of referring to that sort of thing			0
@entity0 : it 's a cliched question , but who or what influenced your music ? @entity1 : i grew up listening to @entity152 music , traditional music , my father 's jazz records and my sister 's @entity156			1
and in my father 's record collection , there were things like @entity163 records he brought back from @entity164 ... and i listened to other instruments , to do things that people like piano players could do very easily that are quite hard to do on the guitar			2
so i 've always tried to do some of those syncopated things that pianists do on the guitar			0
sometimes you need to take things outside of your field , to push the vocabulary of your instrument			0
... the more you know about musical history , the richer your possibilities are			0
and i think the more you look outside your own field of music , the more you 're going to discover			2
@entity0 : a few years ago , @entity183 asked a number of people to put together a list of the " best songs of the past 1,000 years , " and you took them seriously , going back to the 11th century			0
were you surprised when they rejected the list ? @entity1 : i think they thought i was taking the piss , as we say in @entity194			1
@entity0 : when anthologies of your work are put together , do you listen and say , " that 's pretty good " or " i 'd like to do that again " ? @entity1 : usually the latter			1
i do n't really like listening to my own recordings that much			0
one of the reasons is , i perform the songs live , and every night things get slightly differently interpreted			2
and the version you perform tends to grow away form the recorded version with the passage of time ... in your desire to keep your music fresh			0
so it 's sometimes horrifying [ to listen ] -- why did i do it so slowly ? or , that 's a really lame version			2
@entity0 : the game @entity58 is very popular now , with a @entity217 edition coming out			0
have you tried to play @entity58 ? @entity1 : ( laughs ) i have n't tried it , no. i have n't had a chance			1
i think it might be fun			0
but i hope some of the people who play these games are actually thinking , " i 've scored so many points in this game , perhaps i should try a real instrument at some point			0
" so i hope it encourages people to take an interest in music , as opposed to just kind of messing around			0
... it 's an extraordinary phenomenon			2
i 'd love to have a go			0
@entity0 : if you had n't managed to fool people over the years , what would you have done ? @entity1 : i really do n't know			1
i think i would have been some kind of dropout			0
i was such a rebel			0
... i 'd probably be one of those people who follows festivals around making hand - tooled leather belts or something , living in a caravan			0
... or a landscape gardener or something			0
i could probably do that .			0
