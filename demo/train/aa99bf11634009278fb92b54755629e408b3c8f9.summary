@entity2 detentions , the kidnapping of bishops , tearing down churches -- these are the actions against @entity8 @entity7 has been guilty of			1
even the pope has not been welcome in @entity7 airspace in the last few decades			2
so when @entity12 was given permission to fly over @entity7 on thursday on his way to @entity15 , many saw it as a sign of hope for religious freedom -- especially @entity19 -- in @entity7			1
the state - run @entity20 calls it a sign of " possible d√©tente			0
" but even as the central government and the pontiff seem to be getting along better , reports have emerged that @entity7 @entity28 have been barred from visiting @entity15 to see the pontiff			1
around half of more than 100 students who had planned to travel from @entity7 to @entity15 to attend the @entity33 event and catch a glimpse of the @entity12 have not made it			1
@entity36 , spokesman for the @entity37 for the @entity38 to @entity15 , told the media that it was due to " a complicated situation inside @entity7			1
" this apparent u-turn in attitude towards the papacy , within a matter of days , has @entity47 - watchers confused , hinting at an increasingly opaque @entity7 government that is struggling to manage its religious groups			1
" there 's a pattern of pendular movement in the @entity7 government 's stance towards religion , of being repressive and then of being accommodating , " says @entity50 , associate professor of @entity51 , at the @entity52			1
" i do n't believe that the @entity47 and the @entity64 will come to any agreement in the manner that some might hope , " he said , adding that he has heard from a source , which he does not wish to name for security reasons , that the students who did not make it to the event in @entity15 are currently unaccounted for			1
@entity1 is not able to independently confirm this			0
woes of worship the @entity47 and @entity71 have had no formal relations since the @entity64 came into power in 1949			2
officially an atheist country , @entity7 does not recognize the authority of the @entity47 over its millions of @entity28			2
instead , it has set up its own catholic governing body , known as the @entity77 that answers to the party			0
this association is similar to other state organizations that manage followers of major faiths , including the @entity83 for @entity84 and the @entity85			1
but there are other religious groups in @entity7 that have not been sanctioned by the state and that worship underground			2
@entity90 is a priest and member of @entity92 , an underground @entity84 community			2
his group of worshipers has had trouble finding a permanent location to hold church gatherings , frequently suffering harassment from police , with members of the church arrested or detained on occasion			0
" we put our beliefs above society			0
i do n't think the two are compatible in any way , " says @entity90			0
religious bloom the existence of unregistered religious groups makes it difficult to calculate the number of @entity8 in @entity7			2
a @entity115 study from 2011 estimates the number of @entity8 inside @entity7 at 67 million , about 5 % of the country 's total population at the time , amongst which around 10 million are @entity28			2
this is compared to 10 million christians in total in 1996			0
according to researchers , the numbers are rising quickly			0
professor @entity124 , director of the @entity125 and @entity126 at @entity127 , has predicted that @entity7 will be home to the largest @entity130 population by 2030			1
the rapidly growing popularity of religion may be seen as a threat to the @entity64 's authority			1
" the matter of religion in @entity7 -- especially the issue of @entity138 and @entity130 , including @entity19 and @entity84 -- these are the fault lines in the future development of the country , " says @entity50			1
" i think that the @entity7 government does n't know how to go about assessing the strain along those lines			2
" in the past few months , crucifixes , and even entire churches , have been torn down in @entity7 under the premise of building code violations			0
the @entity130 community has reacted in large numbers , with thousands showing up to protest the demolitions			0
@entity7 - @entity130 in the latest move by the central authorities to control the spread of @entity130 , the governing body for religious affairs has said that it will develop " @entity7 @entity130 theology			1
" " the construction of @entity7 @entity130 theology should adapt to @entity7 's national condition and integrate with @entity7 culture , " said @entity159 , director of the @entity160			1
the announcement was made at a seminar on the @entity166 in @entity167 last week			0
an official five - year campaign has been ongoing since 2013 to promote " positive and correct theological thinking " and provide guidance to official registered church groups			0
just how will a @entity7 - style @entity130 theology look like ? " it will attempt to tie together values of socialist culture and the practice of faith			1
the criteria will probably be vague , they will leave it open so authorities can determine who is violating the rules or not , " says @entity50			0
he predicts that it will likely echo what one hears within the larger context of the @entity7 education system in general , stressing social harmony and social stability			0
