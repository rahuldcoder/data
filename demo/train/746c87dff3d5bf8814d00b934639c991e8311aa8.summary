-- reports of rapes , killings and other horrors are growing in the @entity5			1
rights groups accuse security forces and militia gangs of torturing civilians as world leaders warn that the nation is on the verge of genocide			1
here 's a quick primer to get you up to speed on the escalating situation			2
first things first : tell me about the @entity5 the landlocked nation in central @entity20 is home to about 5 million people			1
it declared independence from @entity25 in 1960 , and has since been under the leadership of presidents or @entity28			0
despite vast resources , including gold , timber , diamonds and uranium , it 's among the poorest nations in the world			0
lack of good governance does not help			0
so why all the chaos ? it started as anti-government resentment			0
a coalition of rebels named @entity44 ousted president @entity45 in march , the latest in a series of coups since the nation gained independence			1
they accused the president of reneging on a peace deal and demanded that he step down			1
months before his ouster , both sides had brokered a deal to form a unity government led by the president			1
but that deal fell apart as the rebel coalition pushed its way from the north toward the capital of @entity63 , seizing towns along the way			1
rebels infiltrated the capital in march , sending @entity45 fleeing to @entity68			1
what happened after the president left ? the nation plunged into chaos			2
looters hit the main cities			0
violence became the order of the day			2
aid agencies warned of a humanitarian crisis as fear of the rebels prevented critically injured patients from going to health facilities			1
an unknown number of people have been killed in remote rural areas that are too risky to access			2
others have fled into forests			0
more than 400,000 people have been internally displaced , according to the @entity91			1
that 's nearly 10 % of the population			1
who 's in charge of the nation now ? after the president fled , @entity44 named its commander , @entity98 , as the new leader			2
he took over and integrated some of the rebel fighters into the army , analysts say			0
was this the nation 's first instance of instability ? no. political turmoil is nothing new for the @entity5			0
about a decade ago , @entity45 led a coup that deposed his predecessor			1
though he later won elections in 2005 and 2011 , he did not have full control of the nation			0
rebel groups ran amok for years , especially in rural areas			2
in fact , four of the nation 's five presidents since independence have been ousted through unconstitutional means			2
ok , the president left and the rebels got their wish			1
why 's the fighting ongoing ? some say greed is a factor			0
ousted government officials have long accused @entity44 of going after the country 's vast minerals			2
then there 's the reprisal aspect			0
when the president fled , the poorly trained national army did n't stand a chance against the rebels			1
rebels capitalized on the army 's weakness and went on a rampage , human rights groups say			1
the list of horrors is endless : rape , torture , kidnappings , looting			0
to counter the attacks , vigilante groups formed			2
reprisals led to more mayhem			0
the country descended into anarchy , and the @entity91 warned that " the seeds of a genocide are being sown			1
what role does religion play in the tensions ? good question			0
@entity44 is a predominantly @entity165 coalition , and as history has shown over and over , religious loyalties can breed contempt and escalate conflicts			1
in addition , the conflict has exposed years of marginalization and discrimination against the northern , predominantly @entity165 population , the @entity91 says			1
left uncontrolled , militia groups are uniting along religious lines			1
most of the vigilante groups fighting back are @entity178 , leading to sectarian violence			1
@entity91 officials have warned that the violence between the @entity178 majority and @entity165 minority now in power could lead to genocide			1
all this is happening a world away			0
why should i care ? the @entity5 is surrounded by countries struggling to emerge from years of conflict			0
@entity191 , @entity191 's @entity193 region , the @entity194 and @entity195 are barely stable			0
any instability is sure to have ripple effects that 'll be hard to ignore worldwide			0
the car is also believed to be one of @entity201 's hideouts			2
the @entity202 sent special forces to the region last year to help hunt down @entity201 , the brutal leader of the @entity205			0
in a sign of a potentially expanded role , the @entity206 recently said it 's considering sending aircraft to assault the @entity201 militia			2
the chaos not only risks destabilizing the region ; it could complicate the @entity201 mission			0
what 's the current government doing ? the current president has tried to distance himself by disbanding @entity44 , @entity216 says			2
@entity98 , the president , has denied that his country is on the brink of genocide			1
" i do n't think there 's a genocide , there 's not even a religious war , all of this is made up , it 's to manipulate , to manipulate the opinion of the international community , " he told @entity221			1
he accused the former regime of fueling the rebellion			0
" they want to create a religious war by all means possible , " he says			2
" that 's what @entity45 wants			1
what is the international community doing ? though world leaders have warned of mass atrocities if nothing is done , the response has been limited			0
last month , @entity25 pledged to send 1,000 more troops to add to the 400 it already has there			0
the current troops in the nation , it says , are there in a noncombat mission to protect @entity25 nationals and help secure the airport in the capital			0
an @entity255 force is already in the nation			0
the @entity91 has suggested its peacekeeping force should eventually replace the @entity20 - led mission known as @entity259			1
that potential force could number about 6,000 troops and 1,700 police personnel , the @entity91 says			1
the @entity263 meets thursday to discuss sending peacekeeping forces to the nation .			0
