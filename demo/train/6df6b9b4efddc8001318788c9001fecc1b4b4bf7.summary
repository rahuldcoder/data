-- @entity2 critic @entity1 does n't think much of the tv networks ' new shows such as " @entity5 , " " @entity6 " and " @entity7			1
" " if the only women you ever saw were those on these shows , you would have a hard time believing that a liberation movement had ever occurred , " he wrote in a recent review			1
" it 's all bunnies , baby dolls and broads -- and bridezillas and bimbos , if you get into reality tv			1
it 's still giggles and jiggles			1
" i 'm with you , @entity1			2
but you know what ? we are fast becoming dinosaurs			0
it 's difficult for me to get excited about weekly reminders of a time when cocktail waitresses were paid to be sex objects , if not sex partners			1
or when young , perfectly coiffed stewardesses worked 12 - to 15 - hour shifts wearing girdles , tight suits , high heels and a smile , no matter how rude the passengers were or how frisky the pilots			1
my reservations are not shared , however , by most of the 20 - something women i know			1
the new shows , along with @entity46 's " @entity45 , " have little to do with today 's work environment , they say			1
they are period pieces , nothing more			1
" it would be like you watching westerns , " said @entity51 , who works for a @entity53 nonprofit			0
( not exactly , honey			0
i 'm not that old			0
) i asked @entity51 and her co-worker @entity58 , both voracious television viewers , to talk about this latest @entity61 run on sexism that started , of course , four years ago with the ad agency drama " @entity45			0
" " it 's important to watch such shows to see how women used to be treated , " @entity51 said			1
" as in , a woman back then rarely knew where she stood			1
@entity74 , a secretary ( in " @entity45 " ) , was promoted to copy writer and @entity71 , head of the secretarial pool , was not			0
it had nothing to do with how hard they worked			0
" @entity58 agreed : " the show helps me understand where women had to come from			1
" neither @entity51 nor @entity58 are bothered by the butt - shaking , boob - exposing women of " @entity5 " or by the creepy older men throwing back shots of whiskey and pinching young behinds			1
they were unfazed even by the comment of @entity88 , the manager , that he married his bunny girlfriend in order to get her " pregnant and ugly " so that other men would n't look at her			0
compared to what else they see on tv -- the reality - tv bimbos on " @entity97 , " for example -- the newest babes are downright classy , said @entity58			0
" bunnies were sex symbols , but it was n't porn like it is now , " she said			0
" @entity102 used to be soft - core , art. now it 's trashy			1
" club founder @entity105 was selling sex , @entity58 continued			0
" the bunnies were simply putting their best merchandise in the window			0
@entity105 did n't create porn ; he just classed it up and monetized it			0
" the bunnies made more money than they could have doing other jobs at the time , @entity58 added , and in some cases , more than their male clients			0
so who really was being used ? the stewardesses of " @entity6 , " full - figured and fully clothed , intrigue @entity51 and @entity58 in part because they are n't the stick figures that populate so much of television today ( including the new , vapid " @entity7 " )			1
" full - figure is a healthier view of women , " @entity58 said			1
i had to agree , even as i squirm at the idea that the ' 60s look she appreciates was dictated by the suits in the airlines ' corporate offices			0
interestingly , the subplots i picked up in " @entity6 " -- predictable " female " themes such as sister jealousy , having an affair with a married man , spending most of their time serving food and smiling -- are not what @entity51 immediately commented on			1
she liked the fact that one attendant went against her parents ' wishes to work for " the world 's most experienced airline , " and that another was recruited to be a @entity147 spy			2
@entity148 suggested some depth to their characters , did n't it ? yes , i said			0
however , i reminded her , those attendants had gone about as far as they could within the airline 's corporate structure , and if they got married or pregnant , they were grounded			2
true , she said , and that makes her appreciate the lack of such restrictions today			2
" hard work pays off for women now , " she said			2
" if you want move up the ladder you can			0
" ( just as her tv idol , @entity163 , did on the recently departed " @entity164 " when the @entity163 family moved to @entity166 so @entity163 could become a college dean			0
) a dose of reality is called for here			0
statistic no. 1 : according to an article in @entity174 , only 12 @entity172 companies are run by women , down from 15 last year			2
no. 2 : while the wage gap between younger women and men has narrowed slightly , men in all age groups still make more than women , according to data from the @entity183 , a @entity53 think tank			2
no. 3 : within the last two years , among 18 - to 34 - year - olds , twice as many women as men have been unemployed and looking for work for a month or longer , according to a forthcoming report by @entity183			2
i suspect @entity51 and @entity58 will , somewhere along their career paths , encounter sexist attitudes as well as disparities in salary and responsibility			0
but i 'm delighted they are moving into the workplace with confidence			2
they do n't have to think about feminism as often as my generation did			0
they were born feminist , as were many of their friends , male as well as female			0
they have more choices than did young women of the ' 60s , are paid more equitably and either laugh off or skewer men who insult them			1
some of them work for women			2
they 're coming out of the starting gate with more speed			1
that 's a good thing , because it will soon be up to them -- and the men who support them -- to move women still further forward			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			1

" @entity5 " and " @entity6 " look back before women 's liberation , says @entity230
today 's young women see the shows only as *harmless* period pieces , @entity227 says
but in the workplace , women have still not *achieved* equality , she says
even so , women are " coming out of the starting gate with more speed , " says @entity227
