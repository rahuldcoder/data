@entity0 -- @entity2 had a mutiny on his hands			1
not with his staff but with his embeds			0
the hardworking , 20 - and 30 - something off - camera network news reporters who chronicle @entity2 's every public utterance had decided on a plan : they would band together and confront the candidate working the rope line , mini-cams in hand , with the hopes of forcing @entity2 to comment on the @entity18 controversy			1
@entity18 had called a woman who testified on the importance of birth control coverage a " slut			2
" not surprisingly , outside of @entity24 on friday , @entity2 declined to answer a question from @entity1 about @entity18 's insult			1
@entity2 rarely answers questions from the embeds and reporters who try to catch him on the rope line			2
he can hear them but simply ignores them			0
the @entity2 embeds are quite used to this			2
since the former @entity37 governor jumped into the @entity39 race , he has kept his traveling press corps at arm 's length			0
even though their news organizations pay roughly $ 1,000 an hour to have these reporters fly aboard @entity2 's press charter for the sole purpose of round - the - clock coverage of the candidate , the embeds have limited access to him			1
in the last month , he has held just one " media avail , " jargon for a brief news conference			0
@entity2 prefers his @entity55 comfort zone , appearing on the conservative - leaning cable news channel sometimes several times a week			1
but the @entity2 campaign 's attempt to control the message fell victim to its own disciplined approach			1
after @entity2 zipped past @entity1 's camera without making a comment , the candidate and his staff hopped aboard their campaign plan for a five - hour flight to @entity68			1
while he was in the air , his adversaries were having a field day with his silence on the @entity18 comments			2
a tweet from this reporter about @entity2 's nonresponse was re-tweeted by other media outlets and within seconds it had entered the social media bloodstream			1
before long , the news ( or lack thereof ) was picked up by the left - leaning web sites @entity82 and @entity83 , which spread the information to their hundreds of thousands of followers on @entity86			1
by the end of the day , the president @entity88 's top political adviser , @entity87 , had tweeted : " @entity18 's vile , appalling assault on @entity91 deserves universal condemnation			1
how can folks who calls themselves leaders walk away ? " it was a clear shot at @entity2 , who was just landing in @entity68			2
flash forward to moments after @entity2 had finished his speech in @entity98 friday evening			2
and @entity2 finally broke his silence			2
" i 'll just say this , which is it 's not the language i would have used , " @entity2 said before moving down the rope line			1
had @entity2 said the same thing six hours earlier , or perhaps something a bit more condemnatory , the @entity39 contender would have averted a news cycle marked by his silence			1
all of this is just dawning on the campaigns in this new maelstrom			0
this is the first presidential campaign to feel the full effects of @entity86			2
back in the 2008 campaign , the site was in its political infancy , used to shoot out press releases and shoot down negative stories more than anything else			0
the last campaign was more about @entity123 -- the @entity124 and so on			0
witness @entity126 at the website @entity128			0
@entity126 has quickly earned a large social media following by tirelessly unearthing long - forgotten and mostly embarrassing videos lurking in the bowels of @entity133 's website and @entity123 and tweeting them out			1
reporters who follow @entity126 then re-tweet his handiwork and the earworm is born			0
if the video is good enough -- such as the one from 2002 featuring then - governor @entity2 describing himself on @entity133 as having " progressive views " -- count on the clip to surface on cable news			1
former @entity142 press secretary @entity141 kept a sharp eye on his own @entity86 account while his candidate was in the race to stay on top of the onslaught of information			2
to stay on guard , he simply followed all of the people tweeting about @entity142			0
" with the expansion of news outlets covering the day - to - day minutiae of the campaign and @entity86 creating a never - ending news cycle , this campaign has made rapid response and message discipline more important than ever , " @entity141 told @entity1			1
naturally , the candidates handle this volatile environment in different ways			0
whereas @entity2 does his best to tune out the noise , @entity164 and @entity165 seem to plunge right into it			1
@entity164 could not be more different than @entity2 in his dealings with the media			1
the former @entity172 senator holds " avails " nearly every day			0
after debates , he barrels straight into the media spin rooms to take questions			0
unlike @entity2 , @entity39 spin - doctors say , @entity164 needs the free media			1
" @entity2 's advantages with organization and funding mean that he is not as dependent on earned media as is @entity164 , " former @entity180 spokesman @entity179 said			1
" @entity164 does more interviews , not necessarily because he wants to , but that he has to , " @entity179 said			2
this approach also has its drawbacks			0
in the days before the @entity189 primary , @entity164 was within striking distance of dealing @entity2 what could have been a death blow in his home state			1
then @entity164 , who should know better given his long history of dealing with a certain @entity196 problem , blew up on @entity86			1
he accused the president of being a " snob " for wanting young people to go to college			0
he said he wanted to " throw up " over president @entity202 's call for a separation of church and state			0
the comments were predictably reduced into 140 - character tweet - bombs that detonated under the @entity189 hopes of his insurgent campaign			0
@entity164 would later chastise the free media for not covering the real issues voters care about			2
message clarity , something @entity164 lacked in those days before @entity189 , may be one way to manage the chaos			0
" you need a clear message across all mediums and be able to quickly dispense with any threats to that message , " @entity142 's @entity141 said			0
for the most part , this is what works for @entity2 -- his embeds spend much of their time tweeting out the more benign details of his campaign stops -- the stagecrafting , the music , the campaign 's message of the day			2
this is all appreciated by the campaign , whose staffers have privately told reporters they monitor tweets with great interest			0
but message discipline has its limits			0
having had quite enough of @entity2 's silence , the embeds banded together in the quest for some kind of social media justice on friday			1
after getting their quote from @entity2 , one of the embeds tweeted out a note of congratulations to her colleagues			0
that tweet was followed by a fair number of retweets .			0

@entity2 's nonresponse on the @entity18 furor gained momentum on @entity86
left - leaning blogs picked it up , and hours later , @entity2 commented
@entity164 is the polar *opposite* of @entity2 in his relations with media
