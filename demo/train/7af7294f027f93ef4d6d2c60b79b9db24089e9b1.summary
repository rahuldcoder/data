demonstrators had staged an @entity29 - style protest over government plans to demolish @entity32 's @entity31 and replace it with a shopping mall			1
" the levels of violence used by police in the course of @entity31 protests clearly show what happens when poorly trained , poorly supervised police officers are instructed to use force -- and encouraged to use it unsparingly -- safe in the knowledge that they are unlikely ever to be identified or prosecuted for their abuses , " said @entity11 's @entity2 expert , @entity34			1
the @entity2 government has launched an investigation into the possible excess use of force			1

government announces democratic reforms @entity11 's report emerged two days after the @entity2 government unveiled a long - awaited series of reforms , which the rights group said fails " to address these violations or to take any serious steps to ensure that they will not occur in the future			1
" prime minister @entity71 applauded what he called the " democratization package , " declaring it a historic moment for the country			0

the reforms also removed the ban on teaching the @entity90 language , and ended the ban of the @entity90 letters " q , " " x " and " w , " which do not exist in the @entity2 alphabet			1
however , @entity90 can only be taught in private schools , even though it is the language spoken by @entity2 's largest ethnic minority			1
another change called for expanding the definition and punishment for hate crimes committed on the basis of ethnicity or religious belief			0
the democratization package quickly inspired a chorus of criticism from a wide range of ethnic , religious and political groups			0
" this is more of an election package , " said @entity110 , a lawmaker from the main @entity90 opposition party , referring to municipal elections expected to be held in 2014			0
" this package could have lifted the obstacles to democratization			0
it could have lifted barriers to @entity120 , to freedom of expression and amended the anti-terror laws , " @entity110 added			0
thousands of @entity124 have been arrested in recent years , accused of collaborating with the @entity125 ( @entity125 ) , whose militants have been fighting a guerrilla war for the past 30 years against the @entity2 state			1

the peace talks have prompted some of the @entity125 's thousands of fighters to voluntarily leave @entity2 for neighboring @entity138			1
meanwhile , women 's groups and lesbian , gay , bisexual and transsexual activists are upset that the reforms did not include reference to hate crimes committed on the basis of gender or sexual orientation			0
though @entity71 offered to create a cultural institute for @entity2 's @entity153 minority and promised to return a government - seized monastery to the @entity156 , he stopped short of reopening the @entity157 , which traditionally educated the country 's top @entity159 clergy			1
for decades , members of @entity2 's dwindling @entity163 community , as well as many @entity165 governments , have called for @entity2 to lift its ban on @entity157			1
" i think it is a step forward and the government says more will come , " wrote @entity167 , a former lawmaker from @entity71 's ruling @entity168 ( @entity168 ) , in an e-mail to @entity170			0
" however , the real issue in @entity2 is political and cultural polarization			2
i wish the package would address issues such as freedom of expression and pluralism			0
" @entity2 president calls for reform @entity2 's president warned about the threats this polarization posed in an address before the @entity2 parliament tuesday			2
" i viewed the peaceful demonstrations of the young people at @entity31 ... as a new manifestation of our democratic maturity , " said @entity187			0

@entity187 has been a loyal ally of @entity71 through the prime minister 's decade in office			0
but as his term in the largely symbolic post of president draws to a close , @entity187 has increasingly challenged some of @entity71 's more controversial policies			0
the increasingly divergent political positions have prompted widespread speculation that @entity187 may be preparing to submit himself as a candidate to be the next prime minister of @entity2 .			2
