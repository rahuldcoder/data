-- @entity1 is planning showdown talks with @entity4 teammate @entity3 , who questioned the @entity7 football star 's commitment to the @entity9 team earlier this month			1
@entity3 , left , is unhappy with @entity1 's contribution at @entity4			1
@entity1 said the @entity12 national captain was " unprofessional " for publicly voicing his opinions , which were reported worldwide from the soon - to - be - published book " @entity15 " by @entity17 writer @entity16			1
" in every football player 's eyes throughout the world , it would be unprofessional to speak out about a team - mate , especially in the press and not to your face , " @entity1 said before watching the @entity4 's 1 - 0 win over @entity19 on saturday night			1
what do you think ? was @entity3 right ? " in 17 years , i have played with the biggest teams in the world and the biggest players , and not once have i been criticized for my professionalism			2
" it 's important to get this cleared up , and i will be speaking to @entity3 either this evening or over the next couple of days			1
me and @entity3 will talk , but that will be a private conversation			2
" @entity3 , who led the @entity40 to the @entity41 final last month , said in the book that @entity1 had been a negative influence since his high - profile move to the @entity9 outfit two years ago			1
he said @entity1 , who brokered a loan move to @entity47 last season , had shown little interest in the @entity4 since coach @entity50 resigned in august last year			1
@entity3 , who leads the @entity4 in @entity1 's absence , also cast doubt on the 34 - year - old midfielder 's leadership abilities			1
but last week he admitted that he should have brought up his grievances with @entity1 earlier			2
" i do n't apologize for what i said , " @entity3 told @entity56 on thursday			0
" i just apologize for the way i did			0
i should have told him to his face			0
i 've long told @entity1 since he 's been gone and i 've been gone that i want to sit down and talk with him about everything			2
" it 's fresh in everyone 's minds now , and it appears like everything has gone on in a short period of time , but this has been a long time coming			0
the timing of it makes it a little awkward and seemingly uncomfortable , but we 'll be fine			0
we 'll get through it			0
" i like @entity1 as a person and i think he 's a very good player			2
the frustrating part was at some point something happened and he seemingly turned off at the end of the year			0
" nobody knows what it was , and my fault is i should have asked him and approached him and i did n't			0
instead i vented to a reporter , and i regret it			0
