-- an old wooden carving known as " the @entity2 " hangs in the @entity3			1
that figurine has stared down at lawmakers for more than two centuries as a reminder of how important cod fishing has been to @entity9 , where generations have made a living by casting their nets out at sea			1
" it 's the only job i 've ever had , " said @entity14 , a @entity15 fisherman , who -- like his father and grandfather before him -- spent more than 30 years braving the @entity19 's rough waters and cold winds in search of fish			2
" it 's not so much a job as it is an identity			0
" but @entity15 , like many coastal towns , now faces the largest cuts ever to the region 's commercial fishing industry			1
an advisory council voted wednesday to slash cod catch rates by 77 % in the @entity33 , a region roughly the size of @entity35 that extends from @entity36 up through @entity37			1
that move , analysts predict , is expected to decimate fishing communities across the region and have a domino effect on seafood processors , wholesalers , distributors and retailers who all make a living off the water			1
" the impact will be severe , " said @entity49 , the regional administrator of the @entity50 , who voted in favor of the cuts			2
" it was n't easy , but it was necessary			0
" a response to low cod stocks , the proposed cuts have left thousands wondering what they will do for work at the start of the fishing season in may			1
scores of fishermen gathered wednesday in @entity67 , @entity68 , to hear the vote of the @entity70 , which has since submitted its recommendations to the federal government			0
" we 're doomed , as they say , " said fisherman @entity73 , whose voice wavered as he acknowledged that his boat , the @entity76 , is now up for sale			1
" i 'm getting out			0
it just does n't make any sense to me anymore			0
" the council also voted to cut 55 % of cod catch rates in @entity83 , an expansive area near @entity36 , which was named by a 17th century @entity85 explorer after discovering an abundance of the ground fish			1
if approved by the @entity89 , fishermen catch rates will drop to about 3,550 metric tons of cod in the @entity33 and @entity83			1
a decade ago , they could net around 20,000			0
from the archives : a fishing way of life is threatened the fish population most analysts agree that cod stocks today are nowhere near healthy numbers , though some fishermen say they 've netted more cod recently than in the past			1
still , the @entity33 has hit only about 18 % of target levels , while @entity83 fared far worse at around 7 % , according to @entity50			2
a government survey found that @entity33 cod , considered a top earner , were so depleted that even if the fishing industry were to shut down completely , it would still not recover to the levels mandated by federal law by 2014			1
and yet , while the stocks have n't replenished fast enough , they have come back , according to two decades worth of @entity50 data tables			2
" it 's more of a management crisis , " said @entity113 , a former @entity50 scientist and faculty member at the @entity115			0
" there 's twice as many cod there compared to the 1990s , but they 're still not at the levels we 'd like to see them at			1
" just a few years ago , the government projected that the area was well on its way to recovery after decades of overfishing			2
federal regulators then raised catch rates to nearly five times the sustainable level based estimates now believed to have been far too optimistic			1
that , combined with warmer waters , pollution and policies that protect natural predators like seals , have all contributed to fewer fish that triggered the mandatory cuts			0
while larger commercial trawlers capable of traveling to more distant fishing grounds are expected to survive , the plan will likely cost most of the region 's smaller crews their jobs			1
" fifteen years from now , it 'll all be corporate , " @entity73 said			1
" the mom - and - pop days are over			0
" still , codfish are n't about to become an endangered species , according to @entity152 , head of the @entity50 's fisheries service			0
coming restrictions are about protecting the overall size of the cod population and complying with federal law			2
environmentalists say depleted stocks show the region needs time to recover in order to save it			1
they say the law and its targets are largely arbitrary and argue that murky science surrounding fish estimates has given fodder to those willing to let their livelihoods founder			0
in september , the @entity89 declared the @entity174 ground fishery a formal disaster , which raised hopes of economic relief that were later dashed in a trimmed - down relief bill for victims of @entity179			0
confronted with possible drops in domestic cod supply , industry analysts say @entity184 consumers will likely look elsewhere , importing more from other countries such as @entity186 and @entity187			2
but the danger , they say , is a loss of @entity184 market share			0
and for men like @entity73 and @entity14 , that shift has already occurred			2
" i call it the systematic castration of the groundfish fleet , " said @entity14			0
but the 47 - year - old man from @entity15 also said he never gave his son -- who 's now in college -- the option to fish in the way that generations of his family had			0
" i was afraid he was going to fall in love with it the way i did , " he said			0
" it 's a shame , but it 's something i knew i had to do			0
