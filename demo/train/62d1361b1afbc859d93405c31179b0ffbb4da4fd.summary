-- e-books are n't just becoming increasingly popular			0
they also appear to be promoting reading habits among @entity5 adults			2
so says new research from the @entity7 , which states that about one - fifth of @entity5 adults have read an e-book in the past year			1
and if you expand that to include @entity5 over 16 who have used an e-reader device or app to read news articles or magazine - style features , the figure jumps to 43 %			1
e-book users tend to read more often than people who read only print material , @entity7 found			1
in particular , they read more books			0
a typical e-book user read 24 books in the past year , compared with the 15 books reported by typical non- e-book users			1
also , a third of people who read e-content say they now spend more time reading than they did before e-books			1
this is especially true for people who own tablets and e-book readers			2
this might be good for the economy			0
according to @entity7 , e-book users are " also more likely than others to have bought their most recent book , rather than borrowed it , and they are more likely than others to say they prefer to purchase books in general			1
" e-readers and tablets ( including @entity46 's @entity45 e-reader , which is a modified @entity48 tablet ) were a popular holiday gift item last year			2
currently 28 % of @entity5 age 18 and older own at least one tablet or an e-book reader			1
and that 's not even counting the people who read books on a smartphone or @entity57 app. then again , @entity7 also noted that e-book users often start searching for books online -- which is n't great news for people who run brick - and - mortar bookstores			1
for now , print reading material still rules the consumer market , however			2
@entity7 found that nearly three - fourths of @entity5 adults read a printed book in 2011 , and 11 % listened to an audiobook			1
print books are especially popular when people read to children			1
print books are also the most popular choice when people want to borrow or lend a book			2
that 's not surprising -- recently author @entity77 explained step - by - step how to borrow a @entity45 book from a public library			0
it 's not too difficult , but is still considerably more complicated than walking into the library and pulling a book off the shelf			0
the survey also found that just slightly more people prefer e-books over print for reading in bed			1
on the flip side , @entity7 noted that nearly 20 % of @entity5 adults said they had not read a single book in the past year			1
in general , people who do n't own electronic reading devices are more likely not to read much at all			2
in addition , nearly 20 % of @entity5 16 and older said they had " physical or health conditions that made reading difficult or challenging			1
" most of these people are older ( 25 % of those over age 50 ) , unemployed or low - income			2
but an interesting aspect of e-book and audiobook technology is its potential to improve the accessibility of written content			0
most e-reading devices allow the reader to adjust the font , font size , contrast , column width , and other factors to compensate for impaired vision			0
plus , they often include text - to - speech technology that can read books or articles aloud -- maybe not with thrilling delivery , but still a useful option			0
this can also be helpful to people with limited literacy			0
the cost of e-reading devices keeps dropping , and it 's likely that in the next year or two companies like @entity46 may be giving away basic e-readers for free ( on the principle that you can make more money selling " blades " than " razors " )			0
as the price of e-readers approaches zero , it opens up more opportunities for people who have been left on the wrong side of the digital divide to access the same wealth of information , entertainment and education as people with normal vision and average - or - better income			0
since the invention of writing , the written word has always disrupted the balance of power in societies			0
while e-books might have started out as a high - tech novelty for early adopters , they may ultimately prove to be a great equalizer across boundaries of ability , resources and education			0
