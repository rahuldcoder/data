-- the number of people worldwide without access to a toilet -- no public restroom , no outhouse , no latrine , no smallest room -- is a whopping 2.6 billion			1
that 's four out of ten people			2
the bucket toilet is the only thing on offer for millions of black @entity14			2
according to the @entity16 , 2.2 million people , predominantly children , die every year from diarrhea -- more than from malaria , from @entity19 , from @entity20			1
that number dwarfs any casualties related to violent conflict			0
these figures are intrinsically related			0
the underestimation of fecal contamination is staggering , sobering -- and unfortunately , silencing			0
@entity28 social - entrepreneur @entity27 founded the non-profit @entity16 ( " the other @entity29 " ) in 2001 , as a support network for all existing organizations			2
it now includes 151 members from 53 countries , which meet once a year to network , discuss sanitation issues and work together toward " eliminating the toilet taboo and delivering sustainable sanitation			1
" goal number one : making sanitation speakable			2
" what we do n't discuss , we ca n't improve , " insists @entity27			0
this year , the @entity44 was held from november 4 - 6 in @entity45 under the theme " driving sustainable sanitation through market - based initiatives			2
" indeed , not only is sanitation a good idea , it 's a good investment			0
biosolids can be composted into fertilizer , sewage can be processed into methane biogas , and even simple latrines in @entity57 are producing compost and fertilizer			0
" globally , if universal sanitation were achieved by 2015 , it would cost $ 95 billion , but it would save $ 660 billion , " writes @entity60 in her newly released book " @entity61			1
" real - world examples follow : " when @entity66 had a cholera outbreak in 1991 , it cost $ 1 billion to contain but could have been prevented with $ 100 million of better sanitation measures			1
" or even more alarming : " @entity70 , for example , spends 47 times more on its military budget than on water and sanitation , though it loses 120,000 people to diarrhea a year			1
" so while 2.6 billion people have no toilet , how many millions of us simply " flush and forget " ? eco-sanitation , or the problem of dealing efficiently and ecologically with sewer systems , wastewater , treatment and purification , is no less a serious one			1
in the @entity86 alone , the sewage system emits some 28.8 million tons of carbon dioxide a year			0
as sewers become overloaded with urban development , drought strikes various regions of the earth , and potable water becomes increasingly scarce , even the flush toilet is now put into question			1
today , those who care are looking at innovative toilet and waste - disposal solutions from @entity57 , @entity99 and other parts of the developing world , where attitudes and habits are still evolving and open to change			0
do n't forget , @entity104 is november 19 .			0

2.6 billion people have no access to toilet ; 2.2 die annually from diarrhea
@entity16 includes 151 members from 53 countries
@entity60 : @entity114 sanitation by 2015 would cost $ 95bn , save $ 660bn
flush toilet , sewer systems also pose problem to ecological sanitation
