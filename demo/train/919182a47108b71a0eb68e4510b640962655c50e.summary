-- @entity2 's capital @entity3 might have an ancient heart , but it is getting a remarkable modern face			1
funded largely by money from oil and gas exports , the city has become one of the most vibrant places on the planet for grand designs , with numerous head - turning projects towering above low - rise @entity15 - era apartments and medieval walled city			2
one ground - breaking work of public planning is known as " @entity20 " -- an optimistic title and flip of @entity3 's old moniker of the " @entity24 " ; a title gained because of oil - related pollution			1
on a 220 - hectare site that was formerly a storage hub for the industry , ground is being cleaned up and prepared for offices , hotels , homes and facilities for 50,000 @entity3 residents and 48,000 workers			1
across the country improvements are being made in infrastructure			0
within five years in @entity3 more roads , new parks , a new transit system , water supplies and internet connections will all be in place			2
already dominating the skyline are the iconic @entity47 that are close to completion , plus the @entity49			0
joining these soaring landmarks are some even more eye - popping structures ; the towers of @entity54 and the @entity55 , designed by @entity57 architecture firm , @entity56 and planners			0
the firm won the rights to build the two projects , as well as the 39 - story @entity62 and 38 - floor future headquarters for the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) , through an international competition			0
" ( @entity2 ) is considered to have the will and economic power based on high - growth that can widely accommodate new architecture designs , " wrote a spokesperson for @entity56			1
" many clients in @entity2 are actively accepting creative designs ... that will provide great advantages to their national development			0
" when completed in 2015 , @entity79 will stand on the banks of the @entity81 , its 33 - stories housed in a vast , down - turned crescent			2
a sister project was proposed called the @entity84 that would have brought something resembling the @entity86 from " @entity87 " to the @entity81 coastline			0
the @entity90 project may take decades to complete and be less radical in its design , but it and other projects in the city shows a commitment to give the @entity2 capital more than just a clean up .			1
