as the world now knows , the star of the @entity2 was not @entity4 or @entity5			1
it was n't @entity7 or @entity8			1
his onstage dance during the halftime show has earned him global acclaim and , i must say , some unfair scrutiny for his seeming missteps			1
but neither the general public nor the media seem to appreciate just how much work goes into an interpretive , character - based dance such as the one @entity10 performed last night , and how easy it is , if you are committed to your craft , to lose yourself in the moment			1
allow me to enlighten you			2
as a former ballerina , classically trained at the school of the @entity28 , i can assure you that @entity10 -- if he is the student of dance i suspect him to be -- trained for months to get inside the head of his character			1
who is left shark ? he probably asked himself			2
and why must he dance ? what is his relationship to @entity37 ? are they lovers ? enemies ? do they share custody of a boy shark who 's starting to ask questions about his parents ' separation , for example ? this is what true dancers -- or danseurs -- do			1
as @entity56 's character said in " @entity57 , " " the steps are n't enough			1
" i speak from experience			2
at 12 i played a mouse in " @entity62 " and for months i studied the abrupt movements , barely discernible to the human eye , of other house mice			2
what moved them ? what was their raison d'etre ? by the end of my character study i had become that mouse			2
it took nearly a year for me to drop character afterward			2
at 13 i played @entity76 in " @entity62			2
" believe me , getting inside the head of an exotic hot beverage would test even @entity80 's imagination			1
i decided to play it complex : caffeinated but also seductive			0
i wrote in a storyline about an elephant and a prince that only i knew about , but i assure you , it deeply enriched the character			0
but by far the most challenging role i was ever tasked with undertaking was that of a sylph -- or an " invisible being of the air " -- in a ballet called " @entity93			0
" the ballet is non-narrative ; there is no plot			0
my character 's motivation was therefore mine to create			1
i imagined her a malnourished @entity101 runaway who came to @entity103 and discovered the simple pleasures of @entity105 and " @entity106			0
" she would return to her homeland one day , but not before she got her bachelor 's degree and some much - needed dental work			1
externally , she was sweet and vulnerable , but inside she was tough as nails			0
the part was only four measures long , but i made the most of it			0
the point is , no detail is too small or insignificant			0
and this likely explains why , to the untrained eye , it seems like @entity10 was off his mark or forgot the choreography			1
he was n't overwhelmed by the lights and the crowd and the music			0
nor -- as some have claimed -- was he unable to see out of the costume			0
this would n't stop an artiste			1
i submit that @entity10 was so engrossed in his character that he felt moved to improvise in the moment			1
maybe he envisioned a shifting tide or prey in the distance			0
maybe he sniffed a shipwreck or sensed danger lurking behind the palm tree			0
perhaps @entity141 had given him the stink eye			0
whatever it was , i 'm sure it was intentional			0
i can recognize a method dancer when i see one			1
so , leave @entity10 alone			1
he is soulful and artistic , and i for one look forward to seeing him stretch and grow			0
sadly , of @entity37 , i can not say the same .			0

@entity150 : *criticism* of @entity10 's missteps in the @entity153 halftime are *undeserved* . @entity10 is an artiste
she says as a young interpretive dancer she worked to plumb the motivations of her characters
