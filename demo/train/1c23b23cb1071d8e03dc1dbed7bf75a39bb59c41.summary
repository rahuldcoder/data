-- over this past weekend , @entity1 , the militant @entity2 group that is headquartered in @entity3 , reportedly used drones to bomb a building used by the @entity7 affiliated @entity6 , along @entity3 's border with @entity9			1
the armed drones , combined with fire from @entity1 ground troops , killed 23 @entity6 militants and wounded some 10 others , according to a report by an @entity17 news agency			1
@entity17 is the key sponsor for @entity1 and has plausibly claimed for the past several years to have succeeded in manufacturing armed drones			1
@entity1 's use of drones marks a milestone for terrorist groups worldwide : it would be the first time a group other than a nation state used armed drones successfully to carry out an attack , marking an important step towards closing the gap between the technological capabilities of countries such as the @entity33 and militant groups such as @entity1			1
after all , it was only in the months immediately after 9/11 that the @entity33 mastered the technology of arming drones and began to use them in combat			0
now , 13 years later a militant organization appears to have reached the same milestone			2
previously , drones were known to have been used by militant groups only for surveillance purposes			1
last month , @entity45 uploaded a video to @entity47 that showed aerial views of @entity49 93 in @entity51 province in northern @entity9 that had purportedly been shot by a drone			0
@entity54 opposition fighters targeting @entity54 dictator @entity55 used sophisticated drones for surveillance in the summer of 2011			0
@entity1 had used drones for surveillance before , but the drones were used on @entity3 's border with @entity62			0
in april , the @entity62 military said it had shot down a drone off the coast of @entity66 and that @entity1 operated it			1
although @entity1 denied responsibility for that drone , it did claim that it had operated another drone that flew 35 miles into @entity62 in october			1
if @entity1 does indeed have armed drones , it joins an elite group of nations : only the @entity33 , @entity72 , and @entity62 and are known to have deployed armed drones in combat			2
according to a count by @entity76 , some 80 countries have some kind of drone capability -- but few of them have succeeded in arming their drones			0
@entity81 , @entity82 , and @entity17 possess armed drones but have yet to use them in combat			2
@entity1 's use of drones to target another militant group shows how warfare is changing : the monopoly of states on the use of military force is eroding , and new technology is leveling the playing field between states and militant groups			1
so what can the @entity33 and other nations do to protect themselves from this dawning threat ? it 's a subject , of course , of great interest in @entity62 where accounts of @entity1 's drone strike on the @entity6 target over the weekend were all over @entity62 media during the past 24 hours			2
most armed drones are relatively easy to shoot down if you have a sophisticated air defenses or a fleet of jet fighter aircraft			0
western countries generally have these , but one can imagine a dystopian future where terrorist groups are able to deploy armed drones against less well defended targets			0
indeed , that future may have already arrived .			0

@entity17 news agency reports @entity1 used an armed drone

militant groups are gaining access to tools that once were only available to states , he says
