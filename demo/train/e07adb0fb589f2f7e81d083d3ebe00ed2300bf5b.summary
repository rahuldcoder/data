-- @entity1 , the @entity3 consumer - protection adviser now running for a @entity5 seat from @entity6 , ripped into the tax plan put out by @entity8 , the state 's former governor , at the @entity10 on wednesday night			1
" he wants to give tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires , " said @entity11 , a former @entity12 law professor who served as the @entity5 watchdog over the 2008 bank bailout			0
" but for middle - class families who are hanging on by their fingernails ? his plans will hammer them with a new tax hike of up to $ 2,000			1
" that 's a lot of money to average folks , so let 's take a closer look			0
the facts : @entity11 's figure is drawn from the verdict of the nonpartisan @entity33 , a joint project of the @entity35 and the @entity36 that reviewed the @entity39 presidential nominee 's proposals			1
an august 1 analysis by the nonpartisan group cautions that it 's not a precise scoring , since @entity8 has n't provided enough specifics			0
but it found that under what @entity8 has said he wants to do " would provide large tax cuts to high - income households , and increase the tax burdens on middle - and / or lower - income taxpayers			1
" " this is true even when we bias our assumptions about which and whose tax expenditures are reduced to make the resulting tax system as progressive as possible , " the center noted			0
@entity8 wants to cut today 's income - tax rates , which date back to the @entity61 administration 's tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 , by 20 % and eliminate the alternative minimum tax on high earners			2
@entity8 says he will make up the lost revenue in part by limiting deductions , exemptions and credits currently available to top - level income earners , though wo n't say which tax breaks he plans to eliminate			2
@entity0 @entity71 : about those 4.5 million jobs ... if a @entity8 administration got rid of tax breaks like deductions for mortgage interest , health insurance and charitable contributions for top earners and cut them only by 42 % for households that earn less than $ 200,000 , the lower - income families with children " would pay , on average , $ 2,000 more in taxes , " the group concluded			1
households without children would see a $ 75 cut under that scenario , the group stated			0
the study was written by @entity91 , a former @entity92 analyst ; @entity93 , who served on the @entity96 administration 's @entity94 ; and @entity97 , who served on the same advisory board during @entity61 's presidency			0
president @entity96 's campaign seized on the $ 2,000 figure , using it in campaign ads targeting voters in swing states like @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			1
the @entity8 campaign disputed the findings of the study when it was released , arguing that the analysis was flawed because it did not account for @entity8 's promise to keep the share of taxes paid by top earners the same and that a reduction in the corporate tax rate -- another part of @entity8 's plan -- would lead to more revenue			1
" there 's an old expression in the computer world : garbage in , garbage out , " @entity8 told @entity126 in an august 15 interview			0
" they made garbage assumptions and they reached a garbage conclusion			2
" the study 's authors said it worked under the assumption that any reductions in revenue due to the corporate rate cut would be made up elsewhere			0
conclusion : the $ 2000 " tax hike " figure that @entity11 cites is grounded in a third - party analysis that @entity8 has criticized , but one the authors stand by			1
the authors also note that their calculations are not precise because they lack some specifics of @entity8 's plan			2
@entity0 's @entity148 and @entity149 contributed to this report .			0

@entity152 say @entity8 tax plan will cost middle - class families $ 2,000
the figure comes from a study from the @entity33 , a nonpartisan think - tank
@entity8 called it a " garbage conclusion , " but the authors stand by their findings
