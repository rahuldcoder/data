-- news that @entity3 president @entity2 is planning to attend next week 's @entity5 summit in @entity6 has been extremely welcome			1
@entity7 is thrilled to have president @entity2 as one of our guests , especially as the success of any initiatives that emerge from @entity5 rest squarely on cooperation between @entity7 and the @entity3			1
such cooperation is as important as ever , and this meeting -- an event i have been involved in for many years -- offers an opening to ending confusion among neighbors in the @entity23 while setting the stage for vigorous economic cooperation and integration in the coming decades			0
the reality is that without strong participation by @entity7 and the @entity3 , @entity5 would not have made such remarkable progress			1
when @entity7 and the @entity3 find ways to work together , all nations benefit			1
but shared economic growth can not come through the decisions or actions of a single country			0
instead , economic integration should be seen as a vital driving force for economic growth and prosperity in the region			0
for example , there have been at least 70,000 jobs created in the @entity3 as a result of @entity7 investment , according to the @entity48 , a @entity42 - based economic analysis think tank			1
these ventures have been characterized by shared goals and a spirit of trust and cooperation			0
meanwhile , the realization of a @entity55 of the @entity5 , which was first initiated by the @entity3 at @entity5 in 2006 , has grown ripe with economic potential			1
how ? the @entity57 would open a free trade zone that would considerably expand commerce and economic growth in the region			0
no existing mechanism incorporates both the @entity3 and @entity7 , the two largest economies in the world , into a free trade agreement framework , something that would be remedied by the @entity57			1
if we put @entity57 into action , the income gains for the @entity3 could approach $ 202 billion by 2025 , according to the @entity70			2
such enormous economic activity across the @entity73 would in turn translate into more jobs for @entity3 , among other benefits			1
another key factor if we want to boost economic growth across the region is infrastructure			0
right now , there is a huge gap between how things stand and the growing demand for greater connectivity and infrastructure development in the @entity23			0
this shortfall is acting as a bottleneck for further development of the regional economy , a fact underscored by the @entity91 , which estimates the region needs $ 8 trillion for infrastructure development between 2010 and 2020			0
to help eliminate this bottleneck , @entity7 has proposed the establishment of a new , internationally funded and managed bank -- the @entity95			2
such a body would offer efficient financing for badly needed transportation , telecommunications and energy projects across the region , and it could be a strong , complementary source of financing development to institutions such as the @entity104 and @entity91			0
we therefore hope this idea will secure the necessary support as the @entity3 and other nations recognize the need to fund such critical projects			2
finally , innovation is vital if we are to boost the overall prospects for the region , and the @entity3 and @entity7 have a unique opportunity to find ways to combine their expertise and experience to find innovative ways of enhancing our economies , as well as those of our friends in the region			1
@entity7 tech company @entity123 offers an example of what such teamwork can look like in practice			2
in september , @entity123 's initial public offering listing on the @entity129 was priced at $ 68 per share , raising $ 21.8 billion for the company and investors and making it the largest @entity3 ipo in history , with @entity134 the largest @entity3 investor			0
in this case , @entity7 provided an innovative business model in @entity123 , and the @entity3 provided a financing platform -- a clear example of the benefits for both nations of working together , and something we need to do more of			1
when i started working closely with @entity5 , i could not have imagined that it would develop into such a leading forum for economic cooperation in the @entity23			2
fast forward more than 20 years , and it is now clear the group is ready to shape and inspire future partnerships for all of us .			0

@entity7 *ambassador* to @entity3 : @entity7 is thrilled president @entity2 will be attending @entity5
cooperation between our two countries essential , he says
the recent @entity159 is an example of the benefits of a @entity7 - @entity3 partnership , he says
