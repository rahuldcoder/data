she waited patiently for 10 years for a chance to perform on the highest stage and when it finally arrived @entity4 did not fluff her lines			1
thrust into the spotlight at the @entity7 , the perennial reserve goalkeeper put in a virtuoso performance , going unbeaten for a world record 540 minutes during @entity12 's victorious campaign that year			1
in keeping a clean sheet for all six matches at the tournament in @entity16 , @entity4 became the first goalkeeper , male or female , to play an entire @entity20 without conceding a goal			1
" the whole tournament i was n't thinking about it because i was so much under pressure			0
i was just focusing on not making any mistakes , " @entity4 told @entity1 's @entity25 series			1
" but after the @entity20 , it was like ... ok cool , i broke this record ! but it 's not that important for me			1
i 'm more proud that we won the @entity20 as a team			1
" the feat was even more impressive given @entity12 's opposition in the final -- a @entity36 side which had torn apart opposition defenses , scoring 17 goals en route to the final			2
but they could n't find a way past @entity4 , who repelled everything that came her way , including a penalty from the @entity47 's star striker @entity46			1
" as a goalkeeper you are always happy when you save a penalty , but it was a special one because we were leading 1 - 0			1
it was the final and world star @entity46 shooting a penalty against a nobody goalkeeper ... it makes me proud			1
it was an important save			0
" it was the standout moment that helped launch @entity4 's career , finally allowing her to take over from @entity60 , the veteran who had dominated @entity62 goalkeeping since the early 1990s			1
" it was destiny , " @entity4 says			1
" it was not the easiest way , but it was good way sitting on the bench -- you learn , get experience and it was a good life lesson as well			0
" late starter born in @entity74 , a town near @entity75 , @entity4 grew up playing football with the boys in the neighborhood before making her mark at junior level for the local @entity82 girls side			1
but back then she was more interested in wearing the no. 9 rather than the no. 1 shirt			0
" i never wanted to be a goalkeeper , i wanted to be a forward and until @entity86 - 16 ( level ) , i was a forward			1
" after playing in goal in a regional trial match , @entity4 was encouraged to keep putting on the gloves			1
" when i was 15 , i started to train as a goalkeeper and ( i progressed ) very fast and two years later i got my first cap for the ( full national ) team			2
" a handful of appearances followed before she settled into her role as reserve to @entity60			2
it was a situation that suited her just fine at the time			2
" i was n't really mature when i was 17			0
i said to myself : ' oh , that 's easy , ' because i was always very athletic and did n't need to train -- i was still much better than all the others , " she recalls of her attitude when she was younger			0
this relaxed outlook extended to her social life when she started her club career at @entity106 -- @entity4 would spend her days organizing her back four and her nights arranging to go to parties			1
" i moved out of home and moved to @entity111 by myself , my own flat			0
i enjoyed the night life , the party stuff			0
" but @entity60 's more mature approach -- " she really trained hard , " @entity4 says -- would eventually rub off and when the veteran keeper injured her knee just weeks before the 2007 @entity20 , @entity4 was prepared			1
" i was waiting 10 years and i 'd developed so much as a goalkeeper			2
i trained so hard and i wanted to be the no. 1 ... it was now my time to show it			2
" leading from the back further triumphs followed at the women 's @entity126 in both 2009 and 2013 -- where she reprised her penalty - saving heroics not once , but twice in the final against @entity130			1
it was @entity12 's sixth successive @entity132 triumph in all , but it was in many ways her finest moment as she captained a severely depleted @entity62 team to glory			2
" before the @entity140 championships , seven players from our normal line up got injured ... and so we had to replace ( them ) with some very , very young players			0
i think our average age was 22 , 23 , " she explains			0
" this was the tournament which showed me what you can achieve if you have a good team spirit -- we definitely were n't the best team at that tournament			0
" but we won it because we were a team and that made me so proud			2
this was actually the most important tournament i ever played			0
" her outstanding individual performance and leadership skills did n't go unnoticed by the wider football community who voted @entity4 the world women 's player of the year in 2013 at @entity162 's annual @entity161 ceremony in january last year			1
@entity163 and @entity165 star @entity164 may have taken all the headlines , picking up his second best player award , but once again @entity4 was quietly celebrating another first -- she is the only goalkeeper , male or female , to win the award			1
forward thinking @entity4 has enjoyed successful stints at @entity62 clubs , winning the @entity173 twice ( 2004 and 2006 ) and a @entity174 with @entity175 , and latterly the @entity176 with @entity75 in 2011			1
since 2013 , she has divided her time between the @entity177 and @entity178 , playing for the @entity179 in the @entity180 , and on loan at the @entity182 in the @entity178 @entity183			2
the experience of playing abroad , particularly in the @entity177 , has helped her game evolve , she says			0
" it was a perfect experience for me to go to the @entity177 and adjust to a new system and a new way of playing soccer			0
i learned so many new things ... it 's totally different compared to the game in @entity140 , " she says			0
" my goalkeeping coach from the national team and my head coach , were both like : ' wow ! you 've developed so much			0
' that makes me proud as well			0
" that 's also my motivation that i always have the feeling to keep getting better and better ... even if i 'm quite old			0
" watching her dive around athletically on the @entity205 turf , it 's easy to envisage @entity4 carrying on for several more years at the top level			2
one day , she hopes to coach the next generation of keepers , but it seems that can be saved for later			0
" i 'm 36 and i feel better than ever , so there 's no reason to quit			0
why should i ? i feel good , i 'm fit and most importantly , i like what i 'm doing			0

veteran @entity62 goalkeeper has won @entity20 twice , once as reserve , once as a player
@entity4 shot to fame at 2007 @entity20 breaking world record time for not conceding a goal
she went 540 minutes without letting in a goal and saved a penalty in the final
in january 2013 , the 36 - year - old became first goalkeeper to win the @entity229
