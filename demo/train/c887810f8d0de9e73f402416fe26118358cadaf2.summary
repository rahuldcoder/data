the @entity0 was set to hold a grievance hearing monday that could put running back @entity2 back on the gridiron , but the hearing follows a weekend of debate over whether the league is treating the @entity8 star fairly			1
@entity2 has been on the exempt / commissioner 's permission list -- which kept him off the field , with pay -- since september after allegations he disciplined his 4 - year - old son too harshly with a " switch " or thin stick			2
initially charged with felony child abuse , @entity2 pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault this month			1
the running back avoided jail time , receiving probation , community service and a $ 4,000 fine			1
but he must attend the league hearing to have the exempt status lifted			0
the @entity0 told the @entity27 in september that @entity2 would be removed from the list once the charges against him were adjudicated			1
at monday afternoon 's hearing , which @entity2 was expected to attend via teleconference , arbitrator @entity30 was scheduled to examine @entity2 's case and determine whether the running back , who has missed several games , will be allowed to return to football			1
@entity30 has five days to make a decision			0
meanwhile , the league has told @entity2 he wo n't be able to play football until it finishes reviewing the incident under its personal conduct policy			2
the matter of a friday review of his case , however , had the @entity0 and @entity27 at odds , as the league claimed @entity2 skipped the review , while @entity2 called the review arbitrary and said he " ca n't excuse their refusal to be fair			1
" review goes on ; @entity2 absent the friday review was scheduled with @entity2 last tuesday , a league official told @entity54			1
" as mr. @entity2 was advised , the purpose of the meeting would be to review his case , and would include a group of outside experts who could offer broader expertise on the legal , clinical and football issues involved , " the official said in a statement			1
the @entity27 replied thursday that " it was unavailable " that day			0
the league said it would not postpone the hearing because @entity2 's camp wants the matter resolved quickly and " we had been given no meaningful reason why @entity2 and the union could not appear and participate , " the official said			1
@entity2 also has provided only " cursory materials " in response to the @entity0 's request for more information on the case , the statement said			1
defense attorney @entity77 referred @entity54 's requests for comment to sports agent @entity80 , saying @entity2 's legal case had been resolved			2
@entity80 did not respond to a request for comment			0
@entity77 told the @entity83 , a @entity84 , @entity8 , newspaper , that @entity87 law forbade him from handing over materials the state gave him during discovery			0
@entity91 of the @entity94 district attorney 's office , which prosecuted @entity2 , told the newspaper private entities are n't entitled to see the prosecution 's files			2
it 's also been widely reported that judge @entity99 sealed @entity2 's case file earlier this month			2
the @entity0 official told @entity54 alternative dates were offered for last week 's review , but they were deemed unacceptable , so the @entity0 conducted the review without @entity2 present			1
" we had hoped that @entity2 would take advantage of his opportunity to be heard and present whatever information he believes should be considered before a decision on discipline , counseling and services is made			2
because he and the @entity27 elected not to do so , we will have to address this based on the information currently available to us , " the official said			0
@entity2 disputes league claim @entity2 's sunday statement called reports that he backed out of the meeting " not true			0
" the review is " something new and inconsistent with " the league 's collective bargaining agreement , @entity2 said , so the @entity27 contacted the league numerous times last week to inquire about the nature of the review and the logistics			1
the league responded late wednesday but " did n't answer important questions about their proposed ' hearing , ' " his statement said			0
@entity2 said he told the @entity0 he would attend monday 's hearing -- which is in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement -- " but i would n't participate in a newly created and non-collectively bargained pre-discipline ' hearing ' that would include outside people i do n't know and who would have roles in the process that the @entity0 would n't disclose			1
" he continued , " at this point , i 've resolved my matter in the criminal court ; i 've worked to make amends for what i 've done ; i 've missed most of the season , and i stand ready to be candid and forthcoming with ( @entity147 about what happened			0
however , i will not allow the @entity0 to impose a new process of discipline on me , ignore the ( collective bargaining agreement ) , ignore the deal they agreed to with me , and behave without fairness or accountability			0
" the process they are pushing is arbitrary , inconsistent , and contrary to what they agreed to do , and for those reasons , i never agreed to the hearing			0
" @entity161 , the @entity27 assistant executive director , also released a statement : " @entity164 office seems more focused on creating an arbitrary disciplinary process for @entity2 instead of honoring a signed agreement to remove him from the commissioner 's list			0
they are simply making stuff up as they go along			0
they should commit their efforts to meeting us at the table to collectively bargain a new personal conduct policy			0
" @entity2 has not played since september 7 when the @entity8 took on the @entity177 in week one of the season			1
as of sunday , when the @entity8 lost to the division rival @entity179 , @entity2 had missed nine games			2
his team is tied for last in the @entity182 .			0

hearing was to determine if @entity2 faces further @entity0 *punishment*
running back has not played since week one as child abuse case *navigated* court
@entity2 has pleaded no contest to lesser charge , misdemeanor reckless assault
@entity0 says @entity2 missed friday review of case ; @entity2 says review is *unfair*
