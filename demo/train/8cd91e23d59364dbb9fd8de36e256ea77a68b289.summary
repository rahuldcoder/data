-- the ceremony was held on a chilly november morning in 1981 on the front lawn of the @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , and after three decades the plain cardboard program printed for the occasion still resonates : " @entity8 , @entity9 : in honor of the @entity11 who at the risk of their own lives and the lives of their families saved @entity18 during the @entity19 -- 1933 - 1945			1
... this @entity9 by @entity19 survivors residing in @entity5 is the first such tribute to the ' @entity11 ' outside of @entity23			1
" patterned after a memorial at @entity27 's @entity26 , the grassy clearing had saplings with wooden markers bearing names of @entity32 @entity31 who had rescued @entity18 who came to live in @entity5			1
one by one that morning , swelling with emotion , survivors came forward to unveil markers			0
also in attendance and honored with a tree was a @entity38 @entity31 couple who lived in the state			0
my mother , @entity42 , a @entity3 educator who had survived 14 months hiding from the @entity43 in the sewers of @entity45 , @entity46 , conceived and planned the garden , and she unveiled markers bearing the names of two @entity46 catholic sewer workers who had saved her : @entity51 and @entity52			1
she died a year later at age 60 , but she had fulfilled a sacred duty			2
soon a monument was added , bronze plaques replaced the wooden markers , and on december 11 , 1983 , more than 700 people packed the center 's auditorium to hear the @entity61 theologian and @entity19 scholar @entity62 formally dedicate the garden			1
the story of the @entity4 garden , and the @entity45 sewer - survival story -- dramatized in @entity68 's movie " in darkness " -- are particularly timely because the @entity69 has designated " choosing to @entity70 : @entity72 " as this year 's theme for @entity74 , the day of remembrance , thursday , april 19			1
because the @entity43 intended that no @entity18 should survive , every survival story is sacred			1
although my mother is not portrayed in the movie , she would have been gratified that it has given wide exposure to @entity51 's heroism			1
still , @entity42 would have rejected the film 's many fabrications concerning @entity52 's equally valiant role			2
she would have been incredulous over invented characters having sex in the sewer for the sake of dramatic tension , or seeing a man who was instrumental in her rescue reduced to a caricature of a pious jew			1
my cover story about my mother in the @entity100 on @entity101 1983 -- five months after her death -- was the first full @entity103 - language presentation of the @entity45 sewer rescue			1
@entity51 died in 1946 , but @entity52 read my account and then shared with me many crucial details yet to be revealed in a documentary planned by the @entity46 filmmaker @entity108			1
the daughter of a poor @entity111 watchmaker in the @entity112 , @entity42 was just 22 on july 27 , 1944 , when she emerged from a sewer manhole in @entity45 ( present - day @entity45 , @entity114 )			2
hundreds of @entity18 had tried to escape into the sewers on the night of the liquidation of the @entity45 ghetto and almost all died in the raging river that flowed through the sewer system			1
my mother found herself in a group of 21 @entity18 whom the sewer workers had agreed to hide			1
originally for money , but later even after the money ran out , the sewer workers brought them food , washed their clothes , moved them when their safety was in danger and visited them every day except sunday			1
some decided to leave as the ordeal wore on and were killed above ground , and one older woman died of natural causes			0
a baby was born and had to be suffocated lest its cries give away the group			0
my mother was among 10 who survived the entire 14 months , and this experience guided her life			1
she was among the first of @entity145 's survivors to speak publicly			2
throughout the months in the filthy underground hideout , she remained focused on a place she had never seen , the @entity148 address 3080 @entity149 , where her older brother , @entity150 , was studying at the @entity151			2
the prospect of reuniting with him gave her something to live for , and when she arrived into the waiting arms of rabbi @entity156 and his wife and son at @entity159 in 1947 , it marked the beginning of a new life dedicated to honoring both her @entity3 heritage and her @entity165 rescuers			0
an @entity167 audience first heard a survivor speak of the @entity45 sewer episode on october 25 , 1949 , when @entity42 , now a 27 - year - old senior in the seminary 's teachers institute , addressed the annual conference of the @entity174 of the @entity175 , meeting in @entity148			1
she later went on a speaking tour on behalf of the seminary with at least 36 appearances in seven states			0
one woman who heard her in @entity181 , @entity182 , introduced her to a cousin who had survived @entity184 and @entity185			2
after a short courtship , @entity42 married @entity187 , the former @entity188 , and they moved to @entity4			0
i was born there in 1955 , my sister six years later			0
during three decades in @entity5 , my mother inspired students and audiences of all faiths with the story of the @entity45 sewer workers who saved her , establishing herself as the state 's eloquent representative of the victims and survivors of the @entity43			1
her message was uplifting , about how goodness transcends religion and ethnicity and national boundaries , continuing from one generation to the next , from one culture to another			0
" i had a mission , " my mother said in 1978			0
" i was n't just saving my life			0
... and when you have a purpose and when you have a cause , then you are able to endure everything			0
... i was living for my parents			0
i was living for my brother			0
i was living for my yet - unborn children			0
i was living for the past , and i was living for the future			0
" my mother maintained contact with the @entity222 and @entity52 families			0
( a third sewer worker , @entity223 , disappeared after the war			0
) as a boy i watched her meticulously prepare parcels of clothing that she sent them throughout the difficult postwar years in @entity229 - occupied @entity46			2
she traveled to @entity23 in 1977 to provide the sole testimony that led to @entity51 and @entity52 and their wives being named " @entity11 , " enabling the two families to receive monthly stipends and establishing them among 23,788 heroic figures from 45 countries upon whom @entity26 had formally accorded the honor at last count			1
as for the @entity4 garden , it 's now a verdant landmark , but three decades of exposure to the elements have taken a toll			2
this summer it will be rededicated with a new entrance , a new monument and new plaques			0
in the fall , new saplings will be planted to recognize more @entity11 who helped other @entity252			2
my mother , who did n't see a tree for 14 months , kept faith with her rescuers			1
now only those of us who remain can keep the garden of memory blooming			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity262 .			2

@entity262 's mother and nine others survived the @entity19 hiding in sewers for 14 months
@entity46 catholic sewer workers saved their lives , and his mother **wanted** to keep faith with them
@entity275 was the force behind a garden memorial to honor " @entity11 "
@entity275 : nazis **wanted** no @entity18 to survive , so every act of rescue and survival is sacred
