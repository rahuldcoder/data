-- @entity1 is par for the course when it comes to " @entity4			1
" from the zombie autopsy in the premiere episode of season 2 and the trough scene just last week , to just general feasting by the undead , the hit @entity6 series is not for the squeamish			2
but even die - hard fans were a little shocked sunday night at a scene in which the character @entity16 and his group of hunters turn into cannibals and eat @entity21 's leg			1
happy early @entity23 people ! how do you think that scene compares to these other stomach - turning tv moments ? 1 ) a foot meets a chainsaw on " @entity30 " back in 2007 , the medical series did a @entity23 - themed episode that should have prepared us for anything			1
hardly anyone saw it coming when a disturbed patient , who was convinced his left foot did n't belong to him , got hold of another patient 's chainsaw and tried to take it off			2
dr. @entity43 finished the job for him			0
2 ) @entity46 gets desperate on " scandal " last season , fans of @entity50 's " scandal " watched horrified as @entity53 's mother tried to gnaw through her own wrist in a " suicide " attempt meant to get her transported from being locked up to a hospital facility			2
it worked and the scene led to some hilarious memes			0
3 ) @entity61 wait on " @entity62 " on the now canceled @entity65 series , they gave a cadaver a colonoscopy with disastrous results			0
it was n't pretty when the water pressure caused the dead body 's innards to explode all over dr. @entity73			0
4 ) pig out on " survivor : @entity75 " things can get pretty gross in the world of reality tv , too , but in 2011 contestants on the @entity82 reality competition had to snag hunks of pig using only their mouths - and they were n't allowed to swallow			1
so in addition to watching them make a mess of the swine , viewers also got to watch the contestants spit			0
5 ) eye - popping scene on " @entity92 " the @entity94 fantasy series " @entity92 " is another that is known to not spare the eyes of fans , and during this past season there was a scene involving a character 's orbs			1
during a " trial by combat , " a character known as @entity103 gouged out the eyes of another using a technique that would be the envy of any slasher film villain .			0

there was a gross scene on sunday 's " @entity4 "
it 's just one of several on tv
even reality shows have gotten more *graphic*
