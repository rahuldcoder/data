-- @entity2 activist @entity1 is a fighter at heart who 's been marching against injustice all his life			1
from protesting against the apartheid regime to championing gay rights , @entity1 advocates for those who he believes do n't have a voice			1
an openly gay , hiv - positive male , @entity1 has battled tirelessly to improve access to affordable treatment for people with @entity14 and even risked his life for the cause			1
today , the 49 - year - old is most passionate about his work in @entity2 's townships , where he 's on a mission to bring better , safer public facilities to poor residents			1
@entity0 's @entity22 caught up with @entity1 to discuss his battle for social justice			1
an edited version of the interview follows			0
@entity0 : are you the kind of person who needs to fight against something , who needs to rally against authority ? @entity1 : no , i 'm exactly the opposite			1
i 'm the sort of person -- i really hope -- who tries to change things and who gives people a sense of dignity , of their own humanity			0
@entity0 : anti-retroviral drugs are life saving and you used access to them to shame the @entity2 government and have them given to ordinary poor people			1
tell me about that process			0
@entity2 : it was a multi-prong process that we did			1
the main ( element ) was educating people at community levels about the relevance of anti-retrovirals			0
the second was using the courts -- especially the high court , constitutional court -- to enforce people 's rights			1
and then of course ( there was ) the need for a treatment plan and fighting the drug companies to bring those prices down			0
@entity0 : you refused to take @entity75 drugs even though you could , to make a point that ' listen , i might die in this fight until ordinary people get it			2
' @entity2 : it was for about four and a half years , and again it 's something that caused enormous pain for my friends and my comrades and so on			1
but the thing i 'll always remember was one day a very , very poor woman came up to me and she grabbed my hand at a demonstration and said : ' what you 're doing is keeping me alive			0
' and i knew that it was a terrible burden to carry , i 've never said this , but it was a terrible burden to carry , but at the same time it was the right thing to do @entity0 : did you go to bed at night and think , ' should i just take these drugs ? ' were you prepared to die ? @entity2 : yes ! but it 's the sort of thing you put out of your head -- you prepare yourself , i was very much prepared to be dead , in a certain sense i was performing the holy martyr publicly			1
and in 2003 when i started taking my medicines , all that changed completely			2
i had to prepare for life , i made plans and my life changed phenomenally			0
@entity0 : you 're still fighting for basic social rights			2
@entity2 : all people who live in @entity2 have to deal with the crime and safety situation ... the basic things , safe toilets , safe streets , safe lights , after school care and that 's what the @entity124 which i 'm part of ( advocates for			1
) we went this morning ... and people get raped when they go to the toilet			0
( there are ) 20 to 30 to 70 people sharing a toilet , toilets that are n't cleaned by the municipality , toilets that are broken , sewerage running all through people 's homes on occasion , but the most dangerous thing ( for ) a person in the informal settlement is ( to ) go to a toilet			2
@entity0 : you 've fought for social justice for your whole life			0
where @entity2 is now , is it what you fought for as a 15 - year - old , is this what you wanted ? @entity2 : @entity2 for me now is in a certain sense immeasurably better off than ever before , immeasurably			2
the dignity that black people to a degree have -- no black person has to lose their family and go to jail for it like we did under the past laws , so that 's one sense of it			2
on the other hand the social and class inequalities are much , much wider and much more dangerous for our society			0
the question we all have to ask ourselves is whether we have postponed our civil war or whether we have avoided it			0
because the civil war happens daily in people 's lives when they ca n't go to a toilet safely , whether that is going to become a public thing is a different matter			2
and unless we address jobs , education and crime , we 're not going to be able to contain our society as a society			0
@entity0 : so the fight continues			0
@entity2 : it 's a struggle , the struggle continues and i like , i prefer the word struggle , because it has two connotations : it has the connotation of political struggle but it also has the connotation of what people do daily in order to survive			1
and it 's the connecting of those two that is the most important struggle in life , the struggle to be an ethical human being .			0
