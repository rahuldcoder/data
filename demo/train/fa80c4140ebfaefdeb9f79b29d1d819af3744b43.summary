-- when the @entity2 hears an extraordinary three days of arguments this week about the constitutionality of the @entity5 , thousands of words will pass between the justices and the lawyers appearing before them			1
still , it 's likely that the single most important word in the case will never be uttered in the courtroom : @entity12			1
the @entity2 can make or break presidencies			1
almost a dozen years ago , five justices thrust @entity15 into the @entity16			0
a generation earlier , in @entity18 v. @entity19 , a unanimous court effectively ended the presidency of @entity19 by ordering him to provide the @entity23 special prosecutor with the @entity25 tapes			1
now , to a great extent , the court will render a verdict on the current president 's first term			2
the @entity2 and election year blockbusters the stakes for @entity12 can hardly be overstated , both substantively and politically			1
health insurance for 30 million citizens hangs in the balance in this case			2
@entity12 took on the challenge that had defeated every @entity39 president since @entity40 -- how to expand access to health care for millions of citizens who did n't have it			1
@entity12 won a brutal battle to get the @entity5 through @entity47 , but it will matter little if the court invalidates the law			1
@entity12 is also , of course , a candidate for re-election , and a defeat in the @entity2 would be a disaster for his chances to win again			1
if the court strikes down the law , the @entity57 candidate , presumably @entity58 , could say that the @entity2 proved his own point -- that the incumbent is an out - of - the - mainstream liberal			1
and @entity58 could add that his own health care plan , for all its similarities to @entity5 , passed muster in the courts			2
read a transcript of monday 's court arguments for any president or any politician , losing is never good politics -- and a @entity2 defeat would mark @entity12 as a loser in a significant and dramatic way			1
the specifics of the case are complex : what is the scope of the commerce clause of @entity79 of the @entity80 ? when is a challenge to a federal law premature ? how does a court separate challenges to specific provisions of a law from a claim that an entire law is unconstitutional ? but the larger issue in the case reflects a fundamental division in @entity18 politics that has persisted for generations : what is the role of the federal government ? @entity12 is heir to a political tradition of activist government , which asserts that the people can rely on programs that protect them from life 's misfortunes			1
the alternative tradition is based on libertarian principles , which hold that government interference in private markets generally does more harm than good			0
what makes this case so extraordinary is that this debate , as a constitutional matter , looked settled for decades			0
after @entity112 made nine appointments to the court during his long tenure in the @entity25 , the @entity2 embraced a broad conception of government power , especially when it comes to regulating the national economy			1
constitutional challenges to government power became rare , and successful ones rarer still			0
the commerce clause became , in effect , a blank check for @entity47			0
but elections have consequences , and conservative presidents have appointed conservative judges , especially to the @entity2			2
throughout the'70s , ' 80s and ' 90s , moderate @entity57 such as @entity130 and @entity131 reflected the modern consensus that allowed a vibrant government role in the national economy			2
but moderate republicans are disappearing , including on the @entity2			2
chief justice @entity137 and @entity138 reflect the modern conservatism of the man who appointed them , @entity15			0
the legal approach of @entity143 advanced the @entity145 agenda before the name even existed			0
@entity147 has defined judicial conservatism for a generation			0
that 's four votes right there			0
four @entity39 -- @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 -- can be counted on to embrace the @entity158 model of government involvement in the economy			0
as always , that could leave the case in the hands of @entity164 , the swing vote			0
the outcome is uncertain , even if the stakes are not			1
the language will be arcane , sometimes nearly incomprehensible to nonspecialists			0
the subject will be principles , not personalities			0
and so those of us in the courtroom might never hear the name of the man with the biggest stake in the outcome			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			2

@entity182 : @entity2 hears challenge on health reform ; high stakes for @entity12
he says defeat would mark @entity12 as a loser ; would be bad news in an election year
he says details of challenge complex ; real issue dividing @entity18 : what is government 's role ?
@entity182 : *post-fdr* court backed more activist government . not so today ; outcome uncertain
