-- when someone says " @entity5 and apps , " you probably think appetizers , not applications			1
it 's not as natural a combo as , say , turkey and dressing or @entity11 and " losing in front of a national audience , " is it ? ( we know -- those @entity11 are actually pretty good this year			2
) but in late 2011 , if it exists , you can bet there 's a host of mobile apps designed to help with it			1
and , let 's be honest : @entity5 is a holiday with lots of moving parts			1
from ambitious cooking experiments to dealing with in - laws to mapping @entity28 shopping strategies , it can be a stressful day			1
even if you 're not a @entity11 fan			2
( sorry ... did it again			2
) so , feeling prematurely full of holiday cheer , we 've compiled a few apps that might help make your @entity34 a good one			1
no need to thanks us ... just save us a drumstick			2
( bonus : if , despite all this digital help , things go horribly awry , do n't fret			2
whether it 's a scorched bird or a visit from @entity44 's hounds , you can still load up the family " @entity48 " style , and head out for a @entity50 feast or other dinner on the town , using apps like @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			1
) @entity57 the departments store 's annual march through the streets of @entity61 has become as much a part of the @entity5 tradition as pilgrims and pumpkin pie			1
while much of the app is geared toward folks actually attending the parade , there are features that can be helpful even if you 're watching from home in a tryptophan haze			1
it provides a complete list of participants in the parade , along with their marching order , a history of the event and traffic camera video that shows more views than just those available on tv			2
if you happen to be in the crowd , it offers info like a detailed map , nearby dining spots and , perhaps most importantly , the location of public restrooms			0
platform : @entity93 and @entity94 use : make sure to not miss @entity95 the professional chef yes , this is a $ 50 app. ( ok , $ 49.99 , but you figure out something to do with that digital penny			1
) and it 's @entity102 only			0
but if you 're serious about your kitchen pursuits , this one might just be worth it , and not just for ways to craft haute cuisine giblet gravy			0
from the @entity109 , professional chef is designed to maximize what the tablet computer can do			1
yes , there are tons of recipes			0
but there are also instructional videos with @entity109 chefs , discussion boards , nearly 750 photos and the ability to highlight and make notes on your favorites			0
downloading the app allows you access to one free chapter ( we 're not sure if " my @entity129 , my @entity131 " is in there ) , and individual chapters can be purchased for $ 2.99			1
if you 're on an even tighter budget , check out @entity134 -- it 's free			0
platform : @entity102 only use : cranberry sauce that would make @entity138 proud @entity139 this one 's kind of silly , but hear us out			1
while you 're slaving over a hot stove , the last thing you need is little @entity146 or @entity147 underfoot			0
so break out your mobile device and give them something to do that 's both festive and time - consuming			1
in effect , the kids will be able to do virtual finger - painting that wo n't leave a mess all over the dinner table , which is soon to be groaning under the weight of your bountiful feast			1
in this free app , there are 60 colors to choose from to paint turkeys , pumpkins , pilgrims and the like			2
you can shake your device @entity171 style to start over and , when you 're done , save your child 's master work to a gallery or share it via e-mail , @entity167 , @entity168 or @entity169			1
platform : @entity178 , @entity102 and @entity94 use : making @entity180 purple @entity181 it 's a game called @entity181			0
three guesses what you do			0
if you guessed " pluck a turkey , " congratulations			0
you have at least a basic grasp on the @entity189 language , and you clearly understand the remarkable range of possibilities in the app - development world			2
promising " realistic feather - falling action , " this free , touch - based game makes " @entity200 " look like " @entity197 " in terms of complexity			0
but that might be just the sort of challenge you 're looking for on thanksgiving day			0
you can also share your score on @entity167 , as the app 's description says , to " brag how fast of a plucker you are			1
" platform : @entity93 , @entity94 use : useless			0
but is n't that the point ? @entity211 @entity28 ok , it kind of makes us cringe to acknowledge it			0
but while the rest of us are trying to decide whether we have room to cram one more slice of pumpkin pie down our gullets , some of you will already be plotting the next day 's orgy of crass ... er ... holiday consumerism			0
if the concept of hitting the mall at 4 a.m. does n't make you curl up into a little ball , there are several apps to help craft your plan of attack			2
@entity211 @entity28 helps you find more than 10,000 advertised @entity232 - friday deals from major retailers like @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 -- in some cases before those ads appear elsewhere			0
the app lets you create a personal shopping list , receive notifications when new deals you may like appear and even share deals with friends on @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity245			1
it 's also set up to let you find online deals -- a plus for those of us reluctant to leave the house			0
platform : @entity178 , @entity102 and @entity253 , @entity94 use : maxing out your credit card			0
