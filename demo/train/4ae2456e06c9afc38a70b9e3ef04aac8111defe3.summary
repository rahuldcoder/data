-- it took five days for @entity3 authorities to realize a parolee disabled his ankle monitor and fled , beginning what investigators would later say was a deadly crime spree that ended in a shootout in @entity10 , according to records released tuesday			1
the documents released by the @entity13 detail how 28 - year - old @entity14 managed to elude authorities in the days leading up to the killings of prisons chief @entity16 and part - time pizza deliveryman @entity17			1
the state @entity13 did not respond to repeated requests from @entity0 for comment			0
the release of the documents follows news this week that a clerical error resulted in @entity14 's release four years early from prison			1
that revelation prompted an apology from the district court where the mistake was made			0
@entity14 was sentenced to eight years in prison in 2005 for armed robbery			1
in 2008 , he was sentenced to another four years -- to be served consecutively -- for punching a prison guard			0
a clerical error listed @entity14 's four - year sentence as concurrent , meaning he would not have to serve additional time beyond his original sentence			2
for @entity17 's wife , it was too little , too late			0
" clerical error ai n't going to bring my husband back , " @entity41 told @entity0 affiliate @entity42			1
" [ it ] ai n't going to bring @entity16 back			2
it 's not going to bring my children 's father back			0
how do i tell my 4 - year - old ( that ) daddy was murdered because of a clerical error ? " authorities have speculated @entity14 might have killed @entity17 for his uniform so he could use it as a disguise in the killing of @entity16 , who was gunned down after he opened his front door			1
investigators have said they are looking into whether @entity14 , a member of a white supremacist prison gang , might have conspired with other inmates to kill @entity16			1
the corrections chief earned widespread recognition not only for prison reforms but also for a crackdown on prison gangs , including the white supremacist @entity68 , who once counted @entity14 among their ranks			2
@entity14 was released from prison on january 28 , according to the records			2
between his release and march 13 , @entity14 appeared to comply with his parole , which required he wear an ankle monitor , check in daily with parole officials by phone , abide by an 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew and stay out of bars , the records show			1
@entity14 told prison guard she would ' beg for her life ' the first indication something was wrong came march 14 , when the ankle monitor gave off a " tamper alert			0
" here is a timeline of how @entity14 managed to elude authorities , according to the corrections department documents and previous statements by authorities : march 14 @entity14 made his daily telephone call to check in with parole officials at 7:20 a.m. the " tamper alert " went off at 1:54 p.m. , and the company that oversees the monitoring system -- known as @entity97 -- notes the alert at 3:21 p.m. initially , the ankle monitor was listed " for repair " and a message was left for @entity14 to make arrangements to fix the ankle monitor			1
by 11:15 p.m. , @entity14 had not checked in for messages			0
march 15 @entity14 failed to check in with parole officials , and a message was left for him to report to an appointment scheduled for the next day to repair his ankle monitor			1
@entity14 again failed to pick up messages			0
his whereabouts , at this point , were unknown			0
march 16 the " tamper alert " for @entity14 's ankle monitor was still active , and he failed to show up for an appointment to repair the monitor			2
march 17 contractors who oversaw the ankle monitoring of inmates notified parole officials that @entity14 failed to " make contact " to have his ankle monitor repaired			1
authorities believe this was the same day that @entity14 killed @entity17 , the pizza deliveryman , whose body was found in the suburban @entity127 community of @entity128			0
march 18 parole officials contacted @entity14 's family to inquire about his whereabouts			1
march 19 parole officials searched @entity14 's residence and determined he left quickly or went into hiding to avoid arrest			1
they begin paperwork to revoke his parole			0
that night , @entity16 was shot to death at his home outside @entity139			0
march 20 the state @entity13 issued a warrant for @entity14 's arrest , citing parole violations			2
march 21 @entity14 was killed in northern @entity10 in a gun battle with authorities that left a sheriff 's deputy wounded			0
