-- at 14 feet long and 2,300 pounds , it 's only fitting that @entity2 is heading for the land where everything is bigger			1
this massive great white shark was most recently spotted 100 miles off the @entity7 coast in the @entity8 , headed toward @entity9			2
and as of june 5 , another great white , @entity11 , was about 140 miles west of @entity12 , @entity7			1
in august , researchers from the nonprofit group @entity14 tagged @entity2 off @entity16 ' @entity15 , along with the 14 - foot long , 2,300 - pound shark @entity11			1
every time the sharks surface , their tags send signals to a satellite that can then pinpoint their locations , which can be viewed in near real time on the @entity14 website			2
so far , each of these sharks has traveled over 1,400 miles			0
it is estimated that @entity2 will be past the mouth of the @entity27 in a week and will enter the waters off @entity9 not long afterward if she keeps to her current course			2
a researcher says the sharks ' paths are surprising for this time of year			1
" every track is giving us new information and going contrary to all the assumptions that we were going on , " dr. @entity33 , director of @entity35 's center for shark research , told the @entity37			0
" having ( sharks ) in the @entity8 is something we thought happened in the wintertime			0
" these huge sharks ' irregular behavior comes on the heels of the catch of a rare goblin shark in @entity7 in may and the closing of an @entity52 beach because of a " swarm " of sharks this month			0
fortunately for the @entity9 , scientists will be able to track @entity2 as she approaches and keep tabs on her and @entity11 for a long time to come			1
according to @entity33 , " these tags can last as many as five years			0
it gives us a completely different perspective from the older tags			0
" perhaps the tags will prove more helpful than the researchers in @entity15 could have predicted , ensuring that @entity2 's @entity9 size is all that she is remembered for			1
