@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 defense secretary @entity3 warned thursday that the @entity4 was " reaching the limits of our patience " with @entity8 over militants that attack @entity4 forces in neighboring @entity1 from havens within its borders			1
" it 's extremely important that @entity8 take action to prevent this kind of safe haven , " he said during an unannounced visit to @entity0 , and that militants can not use the country as a " safety net " from which to attack @entity4 soldiers			1
@entity1 leader condemns @entity26 airstrike ; @entity4 defense secretary visits @entity0 " we have made that very , very clear time and time again , and we will continue to do that , " he said			1
@entity3 also stressed that troops on the @entity1 border have every right to defend themselves against the @entity35 - linked @entity34 and other militant groups when they launch attacks from @entity8			2
" anybody who attacks @entity4 soldiers is our enemy			0
we are not going to take it , " he said			0
" we have every responsibility to defend ourselves , and we are going to make very clear that we are prepared to take them on -- and we have to put pressure on @entity8 to take them on as well			2
" @entity1 defense minister gen. @entity45 , speaking alongside @entity3 at a news conference , said havens in @entity8 were the " most important " issue confronting @entity1 as it seeks to secure a stable future			1
@entity8 's ambassador to @entity50 , @entity49 , said @entity3 's comments were unhelpful			1
" this kind of public messaging from a senior member of the @entity4 administration is taken very seriously in @entity8 and reduces the space for narrowing our bilateral differences at a critical time in the negotiations , " she said			2
" it adds an unhelpful twist to the process and leaves little oxygen for those of us seeking to break a stalemate			0
" @entity67 has yet to respond to @entity3 's remarks			1
the defense secretary may also have irritated @entity8 leaders with remarks during a stop in @entity73 on wednesday in which he joked about @entity8 being kept out of the loop as @entity4 intelligence tracked @entity35 founder @entity76 to a @entity8 town , flew undetected into the country and killed him			1
asked if @entity8 had interfered in the operation in any way , @entity3 replied to laughter : " they did n't know about our operation			2
that was the whole idea			0
" a senior military official in @entity8 , who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media , told @entity2 : " this is @entity50 's way of piling on pressure on @entity8			1
it 's a tactic they 've used for a long time			0
@entity8 has sacrificed thousands of lives , and here you have someone laughing			0
it shows their level of thinking			0
" @entity3 's stern words came three days after a @entity100 drone strike in @entity8 's tribal region killed @entity102 , the no. 2 man in @entity35 and a longtime public face of the terrorist network , and at a time of strained @entity8 - @entity4 relations			1
monday 's strike was the third such deadly attack in as many days and the 21st suspected @entity4 drone strike in @entity8 this year			1
at least six missiles were fired at a militant compound near the town of @entity114 in the @entity116 region , near the @entity1 border			0
@entity8 lawmakers have called for an immediate end to the drone strikes , which have been denounced for killing civilians			0
while in @entity73 , @entity3 said @entity50 had made clear to @entity8 that it would defend itself against those who sought to attack the @entity4			1
" and we have done just that			0
we have gone after their leadership , and we have done it effectively ... targeting @entity35 leadership and terrorists			0
" and very frankly , the terrorists who threaten the @entity4 threaten @entity8 as well			2
this is not just about protecting the @entity4 ; it 's also about protecting @entity8			1
and we have made very clear that we are going to continue to defend ourselves			0
" is not planning for more defense cuts the right plan ? @entity3 is not the first high - ranking @entity4 official to point the finger at @entity8 over a failure to take on extremists within its borders			1
addressing @entity140 in september , just before he retired as chairman of the @entity142 , adm. @entity139 said the @entity34 acted as a " veritable arm " of @entity8 's @entity144			1
he also told @entity2 that elements in @entity8 's spy service were " very active " with the @entity34 in launching attacks on @entity4 forces in @entity1 and that the @entity4 and @entity8 governments and military must work together to tackle the problem			1
@entity139 's blunt remarks to @entity4 senators were widely interpreted as an expression of the growing impatience of @entity4 officials with @entity8 's unwillingness to stop the attacks and the belief that elements in the @entity8 government are actively supporting the insurgents			1
@entity2 national security analyst @entity163 said that @entity3 's criticism did not represent a significant change of tone and that @entity8 officials mostly " tune out " such comments			1
" they are usually pretty frustrated by calls from the @entity4 to do more when they know that more @entity8 soldiers have died fighting the @entity173 than @entity4 and @entity26 soldiers combined , " he said			2
at the same time , the @entity175 is very frustrated over the continued presence of the @entity34 , since it is the most effective of the militant groups operating out of @entity8 , @entity163 said			0
but @entity8 is not going to move against the @entity34 for multiple reasons , @entity163 said , including the risk that it would n't go well from a military point of view and the fact that the @entity4 plans to withdraw the bulk of its forces from @entity1 by the end of 2014			1
however , while @entity8 is keen to ensure that @entity73 does not gain sway in @entity1 after the withdrawal of international forces , it is also in @entity67 's interests to see its neighbor remain stable and out of the hands of the @entity173 , he added			0
@entity3 visits former @entity4 base in @entity194 @entity3 did not visit @entity67 , the @entity8 capital , during his nine - day @entity196 trip , which included stops in @entity194 and @entity198 as well as @entity199			1
relations between @entity50 and @entity67 have been particularly tense since @entity26 airstrikes killed two dozen @entity8 soldiers in november			2
after the fatal airstrikes , the @entity8 government shut down the two @entity26 supply routes in the country , asked the @entity4 to vacate an air base on its territory and boycotted a conference about the future of @entity1			2
@entity26 insists that the incident was an accident			0
@entity4 defense secretary announces new strategy with @entity196 president @entity216 's administration recently defended its use of unmanned drones to target suspected terrorists overseas in a rare public statement , with @entity221 , the president 's top counterterrorism adviser , saying the strikes are conducted " in full accordance with the law			1
" the program uses unmanned aerial vehicles , often equipped with hellfire missiles , to target suspected terrorists in remote locations overseas , with many such strikes occurring in @entity232 and @entity8 , despite internal opposition to the practice within the latter country			0
@entity221 said the @entity4 " respects national sovereignty and international law " and is guided by the laws of war in ordering those attacks			0
despite the public discussion of bad blood between the @entity4 and @entity8 , @entity163 cautions against reading too much into the dispute over @entity26 ground supply routes			2
@entity8 's airspace has remained open to @entity26 forces throughout the dispute and is much more important to international operations , he said			2
@entity8 was also invited to last month 's @entity248 in @entity249 -- at which leaders signed off on the plan for withdrawal of international forces from @entity1 -- without any insistence that the supply lines be opened , he said , in a small sign of easing tensions			0
the @entity8 border area is widely believed to be the operating base for the @entity34 and other militant groups that have attacked international troops in neighboring @entity1			0
@entity2 's @entity262 and journalist @entity263 contributed to this report .			0
