-- the son of @entity3 leader @entity2 early monday proposed the speedy implementation of significant democratic reforms in the traditionally restrictive country , while warning of a chaotic civil war , return to colonialism and mass poverty if citizens sided with anti-government demonstrators			1
" tomorrow , we can speak rationally , we can spare the blood , we can stand all together for the sake of @entity3 , " @entity13 said during a speech on @entity3 state television that he said was unscripted			1
but if the unrest continues , " forget about democracy , forget about reform ... it will be a fierce civil war			0
" while criticizing international media for overstating its extent , the younger @entity2 acknowledged the violence in @entity3 as well as " mistakes " by police and military in addressing unrest			1
still , he principally blamed drunks , criminals and foreigners for fanning dissent and instigating attacks that threatened to tear apart @entity3			1
@entity2 : @entity3 's flamboyant , mercurial ruler eyewitnesses told @entity0 by phone about tear gas and gunfire targeting anti-government demonstrators in @entity41 , and claimed that -- after days of unrest that left at least 219 dead , according to medical sources -- opposition forces had taken over @entity46			1
@entity47 did n't confirm that assertion , though he did call out anti-government elements for " sedition			0
" who is @entity13 ? " this is a national treason , " he said			0
" each one of us wants to be a leader , each one of us wants to be a prince			0
" obtaining independent confirmation on events in @entity3 is very difficult			1
the @entity3 government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests from @entity0 for access to the country			1
@entity0 has interviewed , however , numerous witnesses by phone			0
@entity47 , appointed in 2009 as @entity3 's general coordinator , insisted his father , @entity67 , was not like recently deposed @entity69 president @entity68 and @entity72 president @entity71 @entity70			1
he also said @entity3 was unlike those two countries , predicting that its civil war would be " 1,000 times worse " and its economic hardship even more severe should the current government fall			1
he conceded these are " difficult times " and that " there are people inside @entity3 who are opposing us			2
" even while he cast blame , the leader 's son also acknowledged changing times regionally and proposed " radical " reforms -- like bolstering local governments , relaxing restrictive laws , raising salaries , extending loans and drafting a constitution , which does n't now exist			1
@entity92 , an expert at the @entity93 , noted that the @entity94 - educated @entity47 has pushed such reforms previously , but they have not gotten much traction			0
meanwhile , eyewitnesses -- who are not being identified , for security reasons -- told @entity0 about significant movement and growing violence on sunday , the sixth consecutive day of unrest in the isolated and reclusive @entity103 nation			0
medical sources and others on the ground have said that at least 219 had died nationwide in the violence			1
@entity47 , though , claimed in his speech that international media had overstated the death toll			1
he also claimed foreign nations and " illegal immigrants " had stirred the uprising , with some dissenters attacking government installations as well as stealing caches of weapons			0
the central government lost control of @entity46 , with multiple witnesses reporting that protesters took over @entity3 's second - largest city with support from some military who dropped their allegiance to @entity2			1
however , his son continued to insist the military remained loyal to the ruling government and would be taking an increasingly active role in suppressing unrest in the coming days			2
the reported power shift followed fresh clashes that left 25 dead earlier in the day , a doctor at @entity46 's @entity135 said			1
a source at @entity137 , the city 's other major hospital , said there were 10 people dead there sunday			0
one man told @entity0 that uniformed troops opened fire on thousands of mourners as they passed through the streets during a funeral procession honoring those killed the previous day			0
protesters later sunday packed at least one car with explosives and sent it crashing into a compound wall at a military camp in the eastern city , eyewitnesses said			2
security forces then fired on the protesters as they attempted to breach the camp			0
on the camp 's southern side , meanwhile , protesters drove a tank from a nearby army base in another attempt to break in , witnesses said			1
they have also obtained other weapons , the protester said			0
@entity3 state television reported the camp has been defended , and that protesters were being warned on loudspeakers not to attack the compound			1
the network called it an act of sabotage			0
the protester said that the military camp is significant because it houses @entity2 's eastern palace			1
" it 's a symbol of his dominance here , " he said			0
" and it 's the last symbol , basically			0
" a protester said some fellow anti-government demonstrators had other weapons			0
@entity47 alluded to this claim in his speech early monday , claiming criminal elements had stolen weaponry and even fired them in an attempt to cast blame on military and security forces			0
people said there was a food shortage in parts of @entity46			2
the internet remained down in the city and electricity was cut off for the second night in the row , but was back in the morning			0
one man , a technology expert who has set up cameras airing live online video streams around @entity46 , estimated that the numbers of anti-government demonstrators in the city has grown by 20 % since the protests began tuesday			2
" there are a lot of people getting killed for their freedom , " he said sunday			0
" our goal is simple : we want @entity2 to leave			2
" others in @entity3 reported similar protests in the cities of @entity224 , @entity225 and significantly in @entity226 -- an indication that the demonstrations centered in the east may be spreading west			2
meanwhile , the most significant unrest to date hit @entity2 's doorstep of @entity41 on sunday			1
clashes broke out between a large crowd of demonstrators and people who appeared to be @entity103 mercenaries in the center of the city , according to an activist			0
elsewhere , hundreds of protesters were demonstrating in front of the courthouse , the activist said			0
both groups were calling for the downfall of the regime			0
a woman said she saw demonstrators running down a @entity41 street outside her window , chased by apparent mercenaries in pickup trucks			2
the @entity253 were firing at the demonstrators and throwing tear gas at them , according to the witness			0
many families have closed their windows and turned off their lights out of fear , she said			0
another witness said that crowds of anti-government demonstrators hit the streets and set cars on fire			0
masked , armed men in @entity269 drove through the streets blasting pro-government music , said the witness , claiming that the same people had been firing at protesters and passerby			1
gunfire also rang out near @entity276 and the presidential palace , according to multiple witnesses			2
another man said that men were walking around @entity3 's streets with automatic rifles early monday , firing seemingly indiscriminately			1
the crackdown , as well as the government 's role and reaction to it , stoked the ire of many opposed to @entity2 as well as governments outside @entity3			1
@entity3 's ambassador to the @entity290 said sunday he resigned his position on saturday over " the killing of innocent people			1
" @entity294 said the protesters are asking for " normal things " and that @entity2 is " over , finished			1
" he speculated that the @entity3 leader has only a day or two left in power because " he lost the people			2
" @entity303 foreign secretary @entity302 spoke on sunday with @entity47 and " made clear the @entity303 's grave concern at the escalation of violence , " the @entity301 said in a statement			1
" he expressed alarm at reports of large numbers of people being killed or attacked by @entity3 security forces			2
the foreign secretary told mr. @entity2 that the @entity3 government 's actions were unacceptable and would result in worldwide condemnation			1
" the @entity316 also said it was " gravely concerned with disturbing reports and images coming out of @entity3			2
" we are working to ascertain the facts , but we have received multiple credible reports that hundreds of people have been killed and injured in several days of unrest -- and the full extent of the death toll is unknown due to the lack of access of international media and human rights organizations , " @entity320 spokesman @entity319 said in a statement			1
@entity316 officials have communicated to @entity3 officials including @entity3 foreign minister @entity335 " our strong objections to the use of lethal force against peaceful demonstrators , " @entity319 said			1
" @entity3 officials have stated their commitment to protecting and safeguarding the right of peaceful protest			2
we call upon the @entity3 government to uphold that commitment and hold accountable any security officer who does not act in accordance with that commitment			2
" one man in @entity41 said was particularly angry at state - run tv for " pretending that nothing is happening			0
" a medical staff member at @entity137 was among those sharply critical of @entity47 's speech , calling him a liar and saying -- disputing his assertion that @entity3 could split into several parts if not united under his father 's rule -- the nation was one			1
" there are no divisions among @entity3 , " the staff member said			0
" we want to be united with our brothers and sisters ... all @entity3 think this way , it is the regime that lacks knowledge about the people			0
" @entity0 's @entity372 , @entity373 , @entity374 , @entity375 , @entity376 and @entity377 contributed to this report			0
