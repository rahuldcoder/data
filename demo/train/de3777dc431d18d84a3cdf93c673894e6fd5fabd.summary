@entity0 -- the @entity2 wrestled wednesday with a familiar , if elusive , foe -- legislative intent -- when considering whether a @entity6 man should be compensated after the government violated his privacy by disclosing his personal medical history			2
the justices appeared torn over the meaning of two fuzzy words in federal law -- " actual damages " -- and whether @entity15 's claims of mental and emotional distress are covered under the @entity17			1
" the argument you have made -- and i certainly understand it , that this is the @entity17 and so it 's precisely these types of damages that you would be concerned about -- really cuts both ways , " said chief justice @entity19 to @entity15 's lawyer			1
" what you are saying is this ( law ) covers a really big chunk of damages , because this is what the whole act was about , " @entity19 said			2
" and it seems to me that argument suggests that there is some weight to the government 's point : that if you are going to get that , you really do need clearer " language in the law that would immunize the government to some extent , from a flood of hard - to - disprove lawsuits			2
the ambiguity has divided lower courts for years , and privacy experts say the ease with which the government can collect and share information in the digital age makes the issue of personal privacy liability ripe for review			2
@entity15 , 69 , became a licensed recreational pilot in 1964 , but two decades later the @entity59 man was diagnosed with the hiv virus			2
as his condition worsened over time , he let his private pilot 's certificate and his airman medical certificate lapse			0
@entity15 in 1996 then applied for long - term disability with the @entity66			2
" i was in bad shape , i did n't have long to live , " he told @entity1			0
but as his health improved , thanks to a cocktail of anti-retroviral therapy , he went back to work and wanted also to fly again			0
" i found out they were issuing medicals ( exemptions ) and i reapplied " to the @entity76 " without revealing my @entity60 status , " he said			1
" he received his new pilot 's certificate but , unknown to him , a joint local - federal initiative called @entity82 was launched in 2002			0
using a spreadsheet , the agencies shared and compared the names and personal data of about 45,000 pilots in @entity6 , looking for those potentially medically unfit individuals who were also receiving federal benefits			0
@entity15 was among four dozen or so pilots tagged as a " person of interest			2
" when confronted by government agents , he admitted to a misdemeanor charge of filing a false report			0
he was sentenced to probation and fined , and his pilot 's certificate was revoked			0
the retired business executive 's name was listed in a federal press release and later , through his prosecution , @entity15 's medical history suddenly was a matter of public record			1
" i had been able to control those of whom i shared my information about my @entity60 status , limited to some co-workers , family , and close friends , " he said " and suddenly that was out of my control			1
" @entity15 , who was eventually allowed to fly again , sued			2
" i chose not to reveal my @entity60 infection and that was a very bad thing , " he said			2
" i took responsibility for it and i paid the price			0
and i think now it 's the government 's turn to own up to breaking the law and take responsibility for what they did			0
" a federal judge found both the @entity76 and the @entity66 violated the @entity17 with the information - sharing probe , but said under the law only " actual damages " could be collected by plaintiffs seeking redress			1
since @entity15 made no claims for economic harm , such as lost wages or medical expenses , he was therefore was out of luck			1
the judge found " emotional injury " alone did not qualify and dismissed the lawsuit			0
but a federal appeals court reversed , ruling for @entity15			1
the @entity76 then asked the high court to intervene			0
during a sedate hour of oral arguments , the justices stayed away from the specific claims of emotional harm made by @entity15 , focusing instead on what the law says about qualifying for damages			1
justice @entity149 repeatedly hammered away at the government lawyer arguing for the @entity76			0
she said the federal damages provision in question is similar to state tort claims that include both emotional and financial harm			1
" the person who is subject to this , to this embarrassment , this humiliation , does n't have out - of - pocket costs , but is terribly distressed , nervous , anxious , and all the rest , " she said			0
" the act that the @entity163 is reaching , the impact is of that nature			2
i mean , pecuniary [ monetary ] damages ordinarily attend conduct that embarrasses , humiliates you , causes mental distress			1
" @entity169 of the @entity170 admitted the @entity17 's language may be interpreted as allowing damages for such things as " humiliation , embarrassment and mental anguish , " but said because the phrase " actual " damages remains vague , the government should get the benefit of the doubt , tipping the case in its favor			1
" simply because a plaintiff may have suffered an adverse effect " from the privacy violation , said @entity169 , " does n't mean that the plaintiff suffered actual damages			1
" the bench expressed confusion over which similar but competing terms used in other laws dealing with damages -- " general , " as opposed to " special , " " proven " as opposed to " presumed " -- may apply in the @entity17 's unique use of " actual damages			1
" getting that right in the justices ' minds will mean the difference between whether @entity15 or the government ultimately prevails			1
" it 's sort of odd , " justice @entity203 said , " for @entity163 to borrow from the defamation context and with a defined term of art , ' special damages , ' and not use it in the @entity17 if that 's what it intended			1
" she hinted that view would allow @entity15 to collect for emotional distress			1
but justice @entity211 appeared to support the government , saying various agencies were being burdened with an overly complex and inclusive federal privacy law			0
he suggested it was not meant to cover the kinds of claims @entity15 is seeking			1
" all you have to know is that you should n't give it ( the personal information ) to the other agency , because you are not making it public			0
you are not doing the kind of thing that constitutes an invasion of privacy under state law			0
you just failed -- intentionally failed -- to follow the very detailed and picky , picky prescriptions contained in the @entity17			0
to say that you get emotional distress for that as opposed to what i would call genuine privacy incursions , which state law covers , is a different question			1
" @entity236 , @entity15 's lawyer , pointed out his client 's information was made public , and his name and hiv status are still posted on a federal government database			1
he also made a larger argument , that his client 's dilemma is one that may affect all @entity246			0
" @entity163 passed this act to restore the citizens ' faith in their government , and it made a solemn promise to the @entity246 citizens that in cases of intentional and willful violation , the @entity246 shall be liable for actual damages , " he said			1
" today , the government is proposing that " actual damages " be read in a way that renders this act virtually irrelevant			1
that makes a mockery of that solemn promise			0
" @entity15 attended the public session at the court and expressed optimism he would prevail			1
" they 've betrayed my trust and i ca n't get that back , " he said afterward			0
" there was nothing to lose here			0
i had to do it			0
it was the right thing to do			0
" the case is @entity15 v. @entity76 ( 10 - 1024 )			2
a ruling is expected next spring .			0

the court tries to figure out what @entity163 intended by the words " actual damages "
@entity15 says the words cover mental and emotional distress
the government argues they are aimed at monetary damages
@entity15 says the public disclosure of his @entity60 status caused him harm
