-- @entity1 is an entertainer			1
that 's @entity1 , with a capital " e " : @entity6 , everything and everywhere right now			1
with the long - awaited release of " the 20/20 experience , " his first album in seven years , 32 - year - old @entity1 has managed to endear himself to both women and men -- crafting an amalgam of talents that have made him a character not seen in a generation or two in show - business : the well - rounded performer			1
you wo n't find anyone else like him in music , or @entity24 for that matter			2
it 's an organic chemistry of likability : equal parts movie star , debonair showman , tv comedian and successful businessman			1
" my idols have always been the types of guys who could do anything , " @entity1 told " @entity37 " in 2011			1
" @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 ; and when you look up to people like that , you do n't accept that you need to be compartmentalized			0
" " i would n't call him @entity42 , " " @entity44 " 's , @entity45 told @entity0			0
" i 'll go @entity46 because @entity46 was more of the , a , wise investor , @entity48 , very specific vocal style that evolves -- but you knew it was @entity46 , just as you know this is @entity1			1
and the acting in the kind of movies they were -- arty , but they told a good story and they appealed to the audience of the day			1
" @entity1 's business ventures are as diverse as professional sports franchises and golf courses , fashion , the @entity63 , and restaurants			1
@entity45 added , " here 's somebody who really understands popular culture -- who knows a good project when it 's presented to him , that -- that captures a certain zeitgeist			0
" and then there 's the music			2
it , like the singer , oozes old school			0
" i will not be the type of artist that puts out 10 to 15 albums , " @entity1 recently told " @entity81			1
" " that 's just not who i am			0
they 're really special to me			0
i write music all the time , but until you really feel that desperate need to shout from the rooftops and express yourself in that way , i just kind of keep it to myself			2
i enjoy making music so much that if it does n't come out , that 's ok			2
" once @entity1 decided that " the @entity99 " was worth sharing with the world , he and close friend and producer @entity95 agreed , he told " @entity81 , " to make music " without all the hoopla of , like expectations			1
let 's just make something that feels genuine ... and ... for me , it 's the best stuff i 've ever done			0
" timberlake from @entity103 @entity104 is in his soul ; @entity106 is the @entity107			0
@entity1 is a kid from @entity108 , after all			1
home was actually north of the big city : @entity111 , @entity103			0
the grandson of a preacher and son of a choir director never passed up a chance to perform			0
early videos of young @entity1 singing in church and in local shows reveal a boy who idolized @entity106 , and was himself becoming the performer with the something - special swagger			1
@entity125 , who gave 8 - year - old @entity1 his first real singing lessons , told @entity128 's x factor comes from " his mannerism and his charisma , his hair , that whole bit , his natural stage feel			1
" " people in the music industry always talk about this thing or that thing , but he definitely always had that thing			2
always , " @entity139 , his best friend and @entity141 business partner , added			0
the adult @entity1 now jokes about his lack of formal training , but still thinks his sound is from the past , " funny enough , i learned how to sing when i was a kid [ by ] imitating singers ... like @entity143 and @entity144			1
i was an only child and was obviously really bored , so i would entertain my parents by imitating cartoon voices like @entity152 , @entity153 and others			0
so , you know that about me now , i guess			0
i 'm killing any cache of cool i 've managed to build up over the years , " he told " @entity158			0
" @entity139 believes their hometown informs everything they do			0
" @entity108 is a very , very , very musical town , everything revolves around music			2
from the time we were little kids , you 'd go to dinner and the bar next door has a live band playing			0
so i feel like @entity108 breeds that , or at least it brings it out in you , you know ? " ' @entity174 to @entity175 in 1993 , @entity1 was singing , dancing and acting in the @entity177 's " the @entity176 " alongside a group who would later become a who 's - who of teenage idols , including @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 and future girlfriend @entity185			1
in 2000 , ' @entity174 's " @entity193 " was the top - selling album of the year and @entity1 's picture was hanging inside the locker of teenage girls around the world			1
' @entity174 founding member @entity194 described to @entity0 what it was like working with him then : " it 's almost like he is a perfectionist , but there 's no work involved			0
you know , it 's really just boom , boom , done			0
it 's like , ' there it is			0
' " @entity1 's writing skills were getting him noticed by other big acts , too			1
@entity211 wanted " gone , " a @entity1 - penned ' @entity174 song from their last album , " celebrity , " @entity1 's manager @entity210 told @entity0			1
" we were at the @entity217 and @entity211 's people came and they said , ' hey , you know , i think @entity211 wants to record that record			0
' i looked at @entity1 and i was like , you 're not giving that record away , because i knew how important that record was to him and what it meant for him as a writer to finally get songs			1
" but by 2002 , @entity1 's high - profile relationship with @entity185 was falling apart and ' @entity174 went on hiatus			1
" everybody was kind of figuring out , ' what are we gon na do for the next six months ? ' " @entity210 recalled			0
" and then @entity1 kind of tapped me and said , " i know what i 'm gon na do			2
" he says , " i 've had this music inside of me for quite a while			2
i 'm gon na take this time and i 'm gon na go make a record			0
" then @entity1 launched the solo career that would define his next decade			2
his debut album " justified , " which spawned hits like " @entity242 , " " @entity239 , " and " like @entity245 , " soon became hot enough to land him on the biggest stage of all			0
@entity246 was broadcast live on february 1 , 2004 , from @entity247 on @entity248			0
as " @entity44 " 's @entity45 remembers it , " @entity1 is at the @entity249 performing with @entity250 and he reaches over and he pulls away her top and he has now , apparently , committed the crime of the century			1
" a swift apology put @entity1 back on track , and his star continued to rise			1
his sophomore album , the club - friendly " @entity258 / @entity257 " gave us hits ( and new vernacular ) like " @entity262 " and " what goes around ... comes around " in 2006			2
that was the last new music we 'd hear from @entity1 until now , but in the meantime , his career would explode from @entity267 to @entity268 , music to movies , including the @entity272 - nominated " @entity271			1
" he began investing in business ventures that interested him , became a must - see host of " @entity275 , " and has shot films with major stars like last year 's " trouble with @entity278 " with @entity279 , and the upcoming @entity281 ' " @entity280 , " and " @entity282 " with @entity283			2
then came the last six months			0
" @entity284 " a fall wedding in @entity286 to actress and @entity24 crush @entity288 landed @entity1 back on magazine covers and back into water cooler conversation			2
he followed that up with the new album , released march 19 , led by the single " @entity284 , " featuring @entity296 " @entity99 , " which was completed in just four weeks , according to @entity210 , is currently on pace to sell 850,000 to 900,000 copies in its first week , likely knocking @entity299 ' " @entity298 " out of the top - selling slot of the year			1
on top of that , it was just announced that @entity1 will follow up the soulful album with an additional 10 tracks later this year			1
an immensely successful " snl " hosting gig preceded a week of instantly viral and hilarious appearances on " @entity307 with @entity308			0
" not only is @entity1 making what @entity194 refers to as " grown folks music , " he 's also " doing a great job at reinventing himself , " the former bandmate said			1
" the one thing i always say about @entity1 is he always had an eye and an ear for what 's next			2
not what 's cool , but what 's next			0

@entity1 is being called a *modern* - day @entity46 .
the *multi-talented* star delivers not only in music but also in movies and on tv .
" the @entity99 " is currently on pace to become the top - selling album of the year .
