-- " transformers : @entity3 " is being called so bad , it hurts			1
" hello , police ? i 'd like to report an assault , " begins the @entity6 review			1
" @entity9 at the @entity10 , and it 's still going on			1
come quick ! i barely escaped with my life			2
he gave me a full - body beatdown			2
his weapon ? ' transformers : @entity3			1
' " the fourth installment of @entity13 's toys - to - big - screen franchise is supposed to press reset on the story with a new leading man -- @entity24 in for @entity25 -- but critics have n't fallen for it			1
while @entity13 has said that he envisions " @entity3 " to be the launching pad for a new " transformers " trilogy to follow the one led by @entity25 -- which included " transformers " ( 2007 ) ; " transformers : @entity35 " ( 2009 ) ; and " transformers : @entity39 " ( 2011 ) -- the question critics have asked is whether there needs to be a new trilogy at all			1
@entity24 stars in " @entity3 " as @entity42 , an inventor and single dad of a teen daughter ( @entity44 )			1
he accidentally stumbles upon @entity45 when he picks up an old truck			2
set four years after the events of " @entity39 , " @entity45 and the rest of the @entity48 are now being targeted for elimination , spearheading showdowns between the @entity48 and their allies -- @entity53 , his daughter , and her boyfriend ( @entity55 ) -- and , well , everyone else			2
as @entity24 said at the premiere , " @entity3 " is built to be " bigger and better , but also ( with ) more story ( and ) more character			1
and a whole new threat not only to the humans but also to the @entity48			2
" the good news is that more than one critic thought " extinction " really is better than some of the prior " @entity33 " installments , although that sentiment was n't shared by all			1
@entity70 , for example , found " extinction " to be " deafening , deadening and about two hours too long ... ( the ) weakest installment yet of the 7 - year - old @entity73 franchise if the previous three movies were discernible from one another			1
" but the real issue , as several point out , is the absurdly long running time			0
" you can admire what ( @entity83 ) does without really enjoying it , " says the @entity81 ' @entity80			0
" two hours and 46 minutes of pulverized architecture is a lot to endure , but in every @entity13 movie there are at least a few moments of inspired , kinetic absurdity			0
" the @entity93 acknowledges that there is " a lot of state - of - the - art @entity97 chicanery , and the film is a marked improvement over the wholesale inhuman chaos of the last two installments			0
but the bloat of this latest entry -- at 165 minutes , the longest of the lot -- suggests that @entity13 and his team are struggling to rejuvenate the whole premise			0
" at the very least , says the @entity108 , fans of the franchise will adore the movie			1
" it 's still not a great movie , but it is , most definitely , full - metal @entity13			0
" and if you 're not already sold on bay , or the film series ? good luck ( and we hope you like @entity119 )			0
the movie " is basically a shambles , " says @entity121 's @entity120			0
" if you do see it , i suggest you savor each image on its own terms as a work of @entity119 art. dig the bombardment			0
forget trying to figure out who 's zapping whom and why			0
free your mind -- or risk having it transformed into porridge			0
" actor @entity25 arrested and released after outburst in @entity138 theater @entity0 's @entity139 contributed to this report .			0

" transformers : @entity3 " is n't *winning* fans among critics
at least one reviewer found it to be *painfully* bad
but fans of the franchise will likely enjoy it
