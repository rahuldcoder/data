@entity0 , @entity1 -- equipment that the oil company @entity4 was using to help stop the massive oil gusher in the @entity6 is leaking -- another setback for the beleaguered company in its hope of stopping this disaster			1
the company will need to fix the leak before it can run crucial tests that could show whether an end finally is in sight to the environmental disaster , the company said			1
there was no timetable for when the leak was to be fixed , a company spokesman said early thursday morning			1
earlier , @entity4 was proceeding with the critical test of its crippled well in the @entity6			1
the @entity22 government had told @entity4 tuesday to proceed with the " integrity " test on the well in the @entity6 , and @entity4 had begun the process of shutting off valves on its new capping stack , to see whether the well can hold the pressure			1
it 's hoped the tests , whenever they begin , will show whether the well can be contained -- either by closing the 30 - foot , 75 - ton cap stack or siphoning off oil to the surface			1
that could signal a beginning of an end to the catastrophe that began when the @entity42 drilling rig exploded april 20 , killing 11 workers and launching the relentless oil spill			1
but even if the well is contained , the cleanup could take years			2
retired adm. @entity46 , who is heading the government 's response to the oil spill , announced wednesday the test had been given a green light , after it was delayed for a day so that procedures could be scrutinized			1
he said that after intense consultations with energy secretary @entity56 and other scientists involved , " at this time we 'll be releasing an order to @entity4 to proceed with the well integrity test			1
but we gave them some additional direction to make sure we were are taking due care and in some cases an overabundance of caution , to make sure we did n't do any irreversible harm to the well as we proceed			1
" @entity46 said the officials " sat long and hard about delaying the test " and it was " not easy " to decide to delay			1
he said they wanted to make sure they 're " getting this right " for this " significant event			2
" @entity46 added the earlier delay was not prompted by the @entity73			2
" we advised the @entity73 that we decided to take a 24 - hour break			2
it was us advising them that we thought it was the right thing to do			2
we briefed them , " he said			2
@entity4 's senior vice president @entity80 reported shortly after @entity46 spoke that the middle valve of the three - valve stack had been closed			1
that 's an initial step in the complicated process of closing off the well and checking pressure to see how it 's holding			0
a key question was whether shutting the well was worth the risk , or whether it might damage the well bore			0
@entity46 said the test would be a stop - and - go process			1
it involves incrementally closing three valves on the new cap while testing pressure , a process that could unfold could over two days			0
higher pressure readings would mean the leak is being stopped , while lower pressure indications would mean oil is escaping from other parts of the well			1
it was not clear early thursday if the new leak was discovered by a lower pressure reading			1
the massive cap , which has a better seal than the last cap placed on the well , is about three stories high and weighs 160,000 pounds			0
if the well ca n't be shut off completely , oil could be diverted through riser pipes to ships on the surface			1
the @entity114 and @entity115 currently are at the surface , but it might take several weeks before two more ships can be brought in to contain all the flow			0
@entity46 said a four - vessel system could recover up to 80,000 barrels ( 3.3 million gallons ) a day , more than the high - end estimates of the well 's flow rate			0
scientists estimate that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels ( 1.4 to 2.5 million gallons ) of oil have spewed daily from @entity4 's breached well			1
@entity80 said the @entity114 is ramping up production and recovered about 9,200 barrels ( 386,400 gallons ) on tuesday			0
the test is called an integrity test because it is aimed at ensuring the well bore has enough integrity to hold the pressure in the well when it is closed			0
" in this exercise , high pressure is good , " @entity46 said			0
" we are looking for somewhere between 8 - and 9,000 [ pounds per square inch ] inside the capping stack , which would indicate to us that the hydrocarbons are being forced up and the well bore 's being able to withstand that pressure			0
" @entity46 said that if low pressure readings persist for around a six - hour time frame , that could signal problems with the new cap			0
meanwhile , two relief wells are seen as the ultimate solution to the oil disaster			2
they 're expected to be completed in august			0
@entity80 had said tuesday that work on the relief wells was being delayed while officials prepared for the integrity test , noting that " it 's a good precaution to take			2
" but @entity46 said wednesday in his briefing the government has n't ordered @entity4 to halt work on the relief wells			1
" they are going very slowly			0
they have n't stopped , " he said			0
he did say that operations on the second relief well were temporarily suspended at a depth of 15,963 feet to ensure there is no interference with the first relief well			0
the second relief well is a backup to the first			0
when the relief well does intercept the crippled well , heavy mud and then cement would be pumped in to seal it permanently			0
@entity46 cautions that even if the engineering containment efforts work , there is still a lot to be done in a disaster that has affected the environment and the livelihoods of people from @entity1 to @entity179			0
" there 's still a significant amount of oil out there , and the oil recovery and the impacts of this oil will probably extend well into the fall in terms of oil coming ashore , tar balls , beach cleanup , and then we will be ... trying to understand the long - term environmental / ecological impact of the event , " he said			2
