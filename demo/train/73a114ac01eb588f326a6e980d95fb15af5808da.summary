-- she 's only 23 , but @entity2 is already living a life millions would envy			1
from calendar model to @entity5 big - time : @entity2			1
the model - turned - actress was spotted in a music video and then cast in one of the biggest grossing films in @entity5 history			1
she still only has three movies under her belt , but star status has already been bestowed upon her			1
with no family connections to the film industry and not being from @entity16 , @entity2 traveled a route to movie stardom millions could only dream of			1
after deciding to become a model at the age of 16 , she was picked out of a music video by acclaimed director @entity23 and cast in her next film opposite @entity25			1
" @entity30 " went on to become not only a hit in @entity27 , but also gained wider acclaim among western audiences			1
" i completely did n't expect it			1
when i met @entity23 i thought she was joking			1
and at that point it seemed too good to be true			1
@entity25 is someone who i 've grown up watching , and i did n't think that i deserve being a part of such a huge film			1
it 's only later , when i met @entity25 and when things actually started happening , when i realized that this is for real , " she told @entity0			2
despite her meteoric rise to fame and work on some big budget films she believes she 's learning the job of being an a-list @entity5 actress			2
" i had great debut , a successful film , but after that ... i would think it 's quite difficult to choose the right film			2
you never know what 's right and what 's wrong , " she said			2
" things for me changed quite overnight , actually			2
i remember a couple of months before the film release , not too many people knew me			2
in november 2007 when my film released and immediately after that i had to travel to @entity58 , to @entity59 and to @entity60 , and suddenly everyone on the streets started recognizing me , especially the @entity27			2
that 's when i realized that things have changed			2
" with the public attention has come the inevitable media spotlight on her private life			2
she says she never experienced the " casting couch " but is consistently romantically linked with other @entity5 stars , and there were rumors about a relationship with @entity27 cricketer @entity72			0
" as someone who did n't know how to deal with it , yes it was really difficult for me initially to read about myself or to read about things that are untrue			0
but i think slowly you start learning to deal with these things			0
" @entity2 's father was a professional badminton player , and she played too as a teenager , traveling across the country to compete in tournaments			1
but by her late teens she decided she wanted to be a model and got the full support of her parents			1
" i trained , i lost some weight			0
i then got a portfolio done			0
i sent it to @entity16 to a couple of agencies and waited for awhile			0
i think that period is really the most challenging			0
because that 's really the time that one can really go wrong			0
you can really make some wrong decisions and go completely wrong , " she told @entity0			0
" i had the support of my family			1
i did n't get carried away			0
i think i was patient enough to wait for the right assignment to come my way			0
" as a model she appeared in commercials and music videos			1
since her move into the movie business more commercial endorsements have come her way , but in an industry notorious for its high turnover of starlets she is aware that for actresses there is often a limited shelf - life			1
" for me my life now is my work			0
but i know that at some point i will have to have a life beyond my work			0
and i know that today there 's me , tomorrow there will be someone else			0
maybe i 'll be here for 5 years , maybe i 'll be here for many , many years			0
