@entity0 -- the head of the @entity5 , jailed on charges of sexual assault of a chambermaid in his @entity0 hotel suite , should consider stepping down for the good of the institution , @entity3 's finance minister said tuesday			1
" given the circumstances that his bail was not granted , he should think about whether he is damaging the institution , " @entity13 told reporters in @entity15 , @entity16 , during a meeting of @entity19 finance ministers			1
@entity24 , 62 , was denied bail by a @entity27 judge and remanded monday to an 11 - by - 13 - foot cell at @entity0 's @entity30 jail complex			1
there , the man whom many refer to as @entity24 was placed on suicide watch -- a common procedure in high - profile cases , two sources with direct knowledge of the case told @entity1			1
the case has shaken the @entity5 , an organization of 187 countries working to improve world economies by providing loans and guidance			1
it has also shaken the political world in @entity46 , where the @entity48 politician was considered a front - runner to unseat president @entity50			2
but until his next court appearance friday , @entity24 will neither be working to save world economies nor to endear himself to @entity46 voters			2
instead , he will be largely left alone -- denied contact with other inmates because of his high - profile status , said a @entity0 @entity58 spokesman who declined to be named			1
ahead of tuesday 's meeting to address the @entity63 debt burden , @entity60 finance minister @entity59 said the alleged crimes of the @entity5 chief were " very serious " and suggested letting " justice take its course			1
" in @entity69 , minister of foreign affairs @entity68 called the incident a " disruption			1
" " there 's no doubt that an event like that does cause a disruption in the functioning of a body like the @entity5 when its senior figure is arrested , " @entity68 said			1
" we have to wait and see how that works out , and we have to respect the legal process which is under way in @entity0			2
" @entity85 foreign secretary @entity84 , who was with @entity68 in @entity86 , told reporters he hopes the incident does not affect the " many important decisions ... before the @entity5			2
" " at the moment it is important that it functions well , " @entity84 said			2
" so we look to all concerned to make sure that it does			2
" @entity69 prime minister @entity94 said he was confident the scandal would not affect the organization 's broader mission			1
" @entity69 as a country deals with the @entity5 as an institution , " @entity94 said			2
" we do n't get involved in any individual situations			2
" in @entity103 , @entity102 sen. @entity101 told reporters the situation involving the @entity5 chief was " very troubling , if not damning			1
" " you 've got to give it a few days to let that develop			2
but if the evidence is what it appears to be , i think it would be very difficult for him to manage			0
" on tuesday , @entity5 spokesman @entity115 said in a written statement that the @entity5 had had no contact with its leader since his arrest			0
in @entity24 's absence , first deputy managing director @entity120 has been named acting managing director , " and the fund continues its normal work , " @entity115 said			1
@entity115 also said @entity24 's diplomatic immunity does not apply in the sexual assault case			1
" the @entity129 's ( managing director ) immunities are limited and are not applicable to this case , " he said			1
he added , however , that any @entity5 - related documents @entity24 may have had with him or left in the hotel room would be governed by diplomatic immunity and should be returned to the @entity103 - based organization			0
a former @entity46 finance minister , national legislator and economics professor in @entity137 , @entity24 became the @entity5 's 10th managing director in november 2007			1
he is also chairman of the @entity5 executive board			0
the alleged victim is a 32 - year - old single mother living in the @entity0 borough of the @entity142 who moved to the @entity102 from the @entity145 country of @entity146			1
she had been working at the hotel for at least two years , according to her attorney , @entity148			0
" her world has been turned upside down , " he said			0
" she is very scared about her future			0
" @entity148 said his client is cooperating with police and prosecutors , and would be willing to testify against @entity24			0
@entity24 's accuser picked the @entity5 chief out of a lineup sunday at a @entity0 police station , saying he was the man who had sexually assaulted her , according to a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation			1
" she 's recovering -- slowly , " said @entity162 , the general manager of a @entity164 restaurant she frequents , who described himself to reporters as her friend			1
the alleged attack began saturday around noon , when the housekeeper entered @entity24 's $ 525 suite on the 28th floor of the @entity172 in @entity173 to clean			1
@entity175 deputy commissioner @entity174 said the economist emerged naked from a room , ran down a hallway after the woman , and attacked her			0
he shut the door , preventing the woman from leaving , according to a criminal complaint released by prosecutors			0
" he grabbed the victim 's chest without consent , attempted to remove her pantyhose " and forcibly grabbed her between her legs , the complaint said			1
he also forced her to perform oral sex on him , assistant district attorney @entity191 said at monday 's arraignment			1
the criminal complaint alleges that @entity24 forced the woman to engage " in oral sexual conduct and anal sexual conduct " and tried to force her to engage in sexual intercourse			0
he faces charges that include two counts of first - degree criminal sexual act , one count of first - degree attempted rape , one count of first - degree sexual abuse , one count of second - degree unlawful imprisonment , one count of forcible touching and one count of third - degree sexual abuse			0
the most serious charge , criminal sexual act in the first degree , carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison			0
afterward , the employee went to the front desk , and staffers alerted police , @entity220 said			0
by the time officers arrived , @entity24 had left in the hotel limousine , according to the law enforcement source			0
he called the hotel around the same time police got to the hotel to say he had left his phone behind and asked if it could be delivered to him at the airport			0
investigators told the hotel staff member to agree to do so and police went to the airport			0
two plain - clothes @entity237 police detectives led him off the plane , the source said			0
@entity24 's attorneys pointed to their client 's lack of a criminal record and the fact that his daughter lives in @entity0 as evidence that he was not a flight risk			1
defense attorney @entity248 called the case " very defensible			2
" but criminal court judge @entity250 sided with the prosecution in characterizing @entity24 as a flight risk and denying him bail			0
the impact of his arrest has perhaps been strongest in @entity46 , where @entity24 , where the @entity48 leader had been considered a strong challenger to @entity50			0
but some observers said tuesday that his political future appears bleak			0
" if the accusations are true , @entity24 will not be able to run for president , " said @entity261 , a political analyst and a former top aide to late @entity265 president @entity264			0
@entity1 's @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 and @entity275 contributed to this report .			2
