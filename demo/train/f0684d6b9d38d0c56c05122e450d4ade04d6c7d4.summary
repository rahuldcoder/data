-- well , it was big			0
the @entity3 memorial service , where daughter @entity4 spoke briefly , was a big draw on tv and online			1
the biggest ever ? probably not			0
tuesday 's memorial service for @entity3 was expected to set some high marks for viewership -- and it did			1
but , based on information gathered by various meter - readers , it was no moon landing or princess @entity17 funeral -- events whose audiences , by some reckonings , pushed 1 billion viewers			0
in the @entity23 , the @entity3 memorial aired during the late morning and afternoon , when most people are working			1
@entity25 , the television ratings service , said that 31.1 million watched : not as many as the @entity28 inauguration ( 38 million ) but more than the 2009 " @entity30 " finale ( 28.8 million )			1
in all or in part , the program was aired on 19 @entity23 television networks			2
in @entity35 , where the show aired in prime time , the memorial service also did well			1
the @entity38 reported that 5.2 million people watched the show on the network @entity42 , and 2 million more watched on the @entity43 and @entity44			1
the service also aired on channels in @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 , testifying to the @entity3 's worldwide reach			1
but it was the internet where the @entity3 memorial really hit the heights			1
global web traffic ranged from 19 percent to 33 percent above normal during the event , according to internet monitoring firm @entity56			1
@entity0 reported 9.7 million live video streams between midnight and 5 p.m. @entity58 , as well as 81 million page views , according to internal data			0
@entity61 had 5 million live video streams , according to the publication @entity64			0
the publication also reported that @entity65 and @entity66 combined for 6.4 million video streams			0
anecdotally , @entity3 also fared well			2
@entity3 - related topics were highly ranked on @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			2
@entity72 , which partnered with @entity0 to let friends and family share commentary during the service , reported 800,000 status updates by 1 million users			2
the @entity28 inauguration , by contrast , had 600,000 status updates during the event , though there were 1.5 million for the day of the inauguration , according to @entity84			0
@entity3 does outrank the president as the most popular person on @entity72 , with 7.7 million fans , versus 6.4 million for @entity28			2
in @entity89 , the @entity3 memorial proved to be less of a draw than locals had hoped -- or feared			1
though the city staffed the area around the @entity94 , where the memorial was held , with 3,000 police officers -- 1,000 more than had been on hand for the @entity99 ' victory parade -- the crowd without tickets may have numbered in the thousands , according to unofficial estimates , and not the hundreds of thousands that had been feared			0
even inside the memorial , which was held at the @entity94 and the adjacent @entity108 , not every seat of the 20,000 available appeared to be taken , according to @entity0 observations			0
the @entity3 memorial also drew hundreds of fans , respectively , to gatherings in @entity114 's @entity113 , @entity116 's @entity115 , @entity118 's @entity117 and a @entity120 store			1
@entity3 is still reigning on the music charts			2
according to @entity123 , the singer had the two best - selling albums in the @entity23 last week -- " @entity125 " and " @entity126 " -- and 13 of the top 20 catalog albums			0
on @entity128 , he has four of the top 10 songs on @entity128 and four of the top 10 albums			0
finally , where there 's a big event , there 's at least a little money to be made off the spectacle			0
at the @entity94 on tuesday , vendors sold @entity3 t - shirts , artwork , decals and even beverages			0
for the real spectacle , though , one must turn to @entity144 , where there were at least 50,000 @entity3 - related items up for auction as of wednesday afternoon			1
among them : 1984 @entity149 trading cards ( $ 15.50 ) , official memorial service programs ( from $ 2.99 to at least $ 10,000 , some with wristbands and tickets ) and even web domain names -- one of which , @entity151 , can be yours for $ 650,000			1
the @entity3 magic may have been dominant tuesday , but someone is obviously expecting it to continue for quite some time longer .			0
