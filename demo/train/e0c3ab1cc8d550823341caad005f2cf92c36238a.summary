on the surface , it resembles just about any other high school in @entity3 -- or any high school in most places around the world			1
students sit quietly studying math , science and @entity10 ; some struggle to stay focused , looking at the clock and waiting for the bell to ring			2
when the school day ends , some move out to the sports fields for rugby or soccer practice , while others study music in emptying hallways			0
what makes this school different is the pictures of two men scattered throughout the building -- portraits of @entity30 's founder @entity29 and previous leader @entity31			1
the @entity32 and @entity33 , which is currently home to 650 students , is one of 10 high schools in @entity3 with long standing ties to @entity30			1
it 's something the school 's principal , @entity39 , is very open about			0
" yes , @entity30 has given us financial support over the years , sending us money and textbooks , " he says			2
the school also organizes annual trips to @entity48 , where students are given highly orchestrated tours of the reclusive @entity30 capital			2
but the students we spoke with laughed at suggestions from some quarters that they are being trained as spies			0
" people think we 're being brain - washed			0
we just want to study @entity30 culture and language , " 17 - year - old @entity57 says			1
@entity60 , also 17 , laughs at such notions , saying , " no , i 'm not being trained to be a spy			0
this is just a place where i can show my pride as a @entity30 , living in @entity3			1
" in fact , most of the students were born in @entity3 , as were many of their parents and grandparents			1
@entity30 was a @entity3 colony until the end of the @entity71 , and many @entity30 were brought to @entity3 -- many against their will -- before the country was eventually divided between north and south			1
but the mistrust runs deep , and many @entity3 are wary of such schools			2
fresh on the minds of many in @entity3 is @entity30 's admitted kidnapping of @entity3 citizens from @entity3 soil in the 1970s and 1980s			1
@entity48 says it considers the matter resolved , but @entity3 has long demanded more answers			2
@entity30 's strategic posture has also alarmed @entity3			1
there 's concern over an imminent nuclear test by @entity30 -- which would be its third since 2006			2
and in december , @entity48 launched a rocket that it said put the @entity93 - 3 satellite into orbit			0
but that is only a small part of the equation			0
amid increasingly threatening rhetoric from @entity30 towards its neighbors and the @entity101 , @entity3 's new prime minister @entity98 is steadfastly refusing to consider requests for government funding for any pro-pyongyang schools in @entity3			1
it 's a high stakes battle for millions of dollars			0
the students and their families argue they should get help with tuition from the central government , and the school should receive subsidies from local prefectures			0
they argue that they are no different from the students at other international schools in @entity3 , which are afforded such luxuries			1
" we pay the same taxes as everyone else , " @entity57 says			2
" it makes me angry as well as sad			0
" @entity39 acknowledges the abductions , and says the students learn about the crimes			0
and when we ask about the ever - present portraits of @entity30 's leaders -- portraits that also hang in his office -- and whether he 's thought of taking them down , he says it 's simply a way of saying thanks to those who 've helped fund the school over the years			1
but he adds , " we do n't force the students to pledge their loyalty to anyone			0
" i just feel bad that my students are caught in the middle of all of this			0
