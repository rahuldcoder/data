when @entity1 pulls on his no. 98 @entity3 jersey , he 's not just representing a basketball team			1
as the first openly gay player in major @entity7 sports , he 's also paying tribute to @entity9 , the victim of one of the most infamous hate crimes in recent @entity7 history			1
@entity9 , a gay @entity13 student , was beaten to death in 1998			0
" i was very fortunate to speak with @entity9 's mother , @entity16 , " @entity1 told @entity15 's " unguarded with @entity17			1
" " she had some great advice i do n't think she would mind me sharing			0
typically i like to keep private conversations private but her message was : ' let the haters hate			0
just keep living your life and keep going out there and being yourself			0
' " it 's a powerful message and it 's proving effective -- earlier this week @entity1 ' no. 98 jersey became the best - selling in the @entity28			1
not bad when you consider that @entity1 -- who had been without a team after coming out at the end of last season -- has only signed a 10 - day contract with the @entity3			1
" it 's really cool to see the support that 's out there , " he said			0
" it 's cool to see that people are going out there and buying the jersey and wearing it with pride			0
" so i hope that continues and i 'll keep wearing the jersey and keep going out there and trying to do my job			0
" @entity1 has been doing his job since making his @entity28 debut in 2001			2
he spent seven years with the @entity3 , the former name of his current employer , before going on to play for @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			2
the center 's first game of 2014 could n't have gone any better			0
the 35 - year - old played 10 minutes during a 108 - 102 win at the @entity59 -- his hometown team -- and was given a warm ovation by the @entity63 crowd			1
the reception he received is an indication of @entity1 ' newfound prominence			2
since coming out in a cover story for an issue of @entity69 in april 2013 , he has become part of a band of high - profile @entity7 athletes who have gone public about their homosexuality -- and they have been supporting each other			1
@entity7 international @entity76 , who plays for @entity78 's @entity77 , announced he was gay two months before @entity1			1
after telling the world about his sexuality , @entity1 went to @entity76 for advice on how to handle the media			1
@entity85 prospect @entity83 revealed he was gay this month after completing his college career			1
if drafted by a franchise , he will become the league 's first openly gay player			1
" i 've met some other athletes who are in the same position as i am , " explained @entity1			1
" we 're sort of like a fraternity just trying to help each other , just trying to keep inspiring each other , whether it be @entity76 or @entity83 , the list goes on and on			1
" and it 's really great to you know hear each other 's stories and keep inspiring each other to work , " added @entity1 , who was a guest of first lady @entity97 at the @entity98 in january			2
a free agent since july , @entity1 ' determination to get back in the @entity28 was such that he went on a five - mile run the morning before his trip to the @entity107			2
" i 've grown so much as an individual , i 've come across so many great people , great organizations , heard so many great stories , inspiring stories , " he said			0
" i feel like with my actions i 've had a positive impact on someone else 's life			0
" while @entity1 ' return to the @entity28 has been a success , it could well be short - lived			2
his temporary contract means he could be out of the league again by the end of next week , but he remains hopeful of extending his professional career			0
" you know anything can happen -- anything 's possible , " he said			0
" you continue to work hard , that 's what i did over the past 10 months ... always having that positive mindset that good things will happen if you prepare for it			2
" it 's the same environment			0
like i said before , 12 years in the @entity28 , not a problem , not an issue			0
year 13 , not a problem , not an issue , same old , same old			0
" for the man who is changing the face of the @entity7 basketball , @entity1 is convinced everything looks just like it did before .			1
