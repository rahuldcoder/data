-- a young boy in a photograph holds a cigarette while sitting cross-legged on a dirt road			0
we do n't know his name , but it 's clear by his face his life is full of pain and struggle			1
in another picture , a mother sits on a rock clutching a barefoot child			2
their faces offer a stark contrast : she looks away , concerned and distraught while he stares at the camera with an inquisitive gaze , trying to make sense of it all			0
a third dramatic image is striking			2
with laser - like focus , a boy who looks to be about 6 wearing a bright red sweater shoots the photographer a hardened look			0
it 's the face of someone older than his years			0
these photographs -- depicting the lives of @entity36 street children -- were taken by children			1
it 's part of a unique project dubbed @entity40			2
founder @entity41 has learned that these young photographers ' own lives are not that different from the children they photograph			1
a photographer herself , @entity41 launched @entity40 in @entity48 when she was just 22 years old , fueled by her passion for photography and her inspiration to help underprivileged children			1
while growing up in @entity53 , she would see street children cleaning the windshield of her parents ' car and would wonder , " why am i so different from them ? " eventually that question spurred her desire to help street children by teaching them a skill : photography			1
" i realized i can give them a camera and hopefully that will impact their lives -- just like the way camera has impacted my life when i received a camera from my mentor , " @entity41 , now 26 , told @entity0 via @entity64			1
" being young has really helped me get through to the kids , they feel that we are close in age and that makes them a lot more comfortable with me , which ultimately gets them more responsive in the workshop			0
" in a nutshell , @entity41 's 10 - day workshop teaches photography skills to underprivileged street children and orphans			1
the project offers an escape from their stressful concerns of street survival and a rare opportunity to develop their artistic talents			2
for many of these children , this is their first time even holding a camera			2
one of the program 's teaching exercises involves taking at least 100 photos of a single object			2
this forces the young students to think about different perspectives and varied styles of shots			2
and it pushes them to see the subjects of their photos more creatively			0
" i gave one a guitar once , " @entity41 said			1
" i gave one a cross			0
i gave one an egg ...			0
" they are -- after all -- still kids			0
@entity41 decided to conduct her first workshop in @entity121 where , according to a report from the @entity124 in @entity125 , there are an estimated 2 million children living on the streets			1
several are subjected to begging , human trafficking and drug abuse before even reaching age 14			1
worldwide , exact statistics are difficult to come by , but the @entity133 has estimated the number of street children in the tens of millions -- perhaps around 100 million			1
the children of @entity40 range from eight to 16 years old			2
most of them , @entity41 said , have been found either living in shelters run by non-governmental organizations or on the streets			1
many have been abandoned by their parents , and some do n't even know who their parents are			0
some were born into their lives on the streets , and have never had a place to call home			0
" i dealt with a couple of kids that were actually second generation off the street and that was really different , " @entity41 said			1
at the conclusion of the workshop , a gallery of the children 's work is set up to display their once - hidden talents			2
the experience of having their images seen and appreciated by the public is entirely new for these young artists			2
" i love being a photographer who can show the world what i see , " wrote one of the children			0
" they might not listen to me , but they can see like me when they look at my photos			0
" the conclusion of the workshop does n't necessarily mean the children will end their exploration of photography			1
they return to their shelters and caregivers with their shiny new cameras in hand to continue learning about their craft			0
in a few cases , the program has paved the way to future employment			0
some of @entity41 's former students are now getting jobs working as freelance photographers			1
another was shortlisted in a photography competition for children hosted by @entity195			1
related : help for @entity197 's children the program is ongoing			1
last @entity199 conducted her sixth workshop -- this time in @entity201 , @entity202 -- working with another nongovernmental organization like her own that helps underprivileged children			1
thirteen children participated in that two - week project			0
several discovered a new outlet for their creativity			0
" they learned the importance of photography , not just as an art but as a tool to self - expression , " @entity41 said			1
" they have also gained self - confidence as the gallery provides a space for them to be acknowledged by the audience for their artistic talent			0
" that 's evident from what some of the children said after finishing the program			1
" i learned that saying what i think or feel is a good thing -- not bad thing , " one child wrote in an e-mail			0
" i also learned that i can tell a story with one picture			0
i can not write very well , but i can now take photos and tell stories			0
" the civil war in @entity197 has pushed countless refugee children into neighboring @entity48 , @entity238 and @entity239			1
if you 'd like to help , contact @entity242 @entity241 , @entity243 or other support groups listed at @entity0 's @entity245 .			0
