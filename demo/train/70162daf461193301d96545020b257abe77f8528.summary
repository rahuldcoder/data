@entity0 -- a year after @entity3 trucks were first permitted to conduct long - haul operations in the @entity5 , so few trucks have signed up for the pilot program that government auditors fear they wo n't be able to complete a congressionally mandated study of the program 's safety			1
only six @entity3 trucking companies -- most with a single truck -- are participating in the program thus far , with some 24 other companies under review			1
as of july , @entity3 trucks had made fewer than 100 long - haul trips into the @entity5			1
unless the number of participating trucks increases significantly , the @entity20 's inspector general says , the department will not have the data needed to determine whether @entity3 trucks present a danger on @entity5 highways			1
the low participation seemingly belies critics of the @entity28 , or @entity28 , who feared the agreement would unloose thousands of @entity3 trucks on @entity5 highways , displacing @entity5 trucks and endangering @entity5 lives			1
but opponents of the program attribute the low participation to other factors , including bureaucratic roadblocks to participation , the trade imbalance and a reluctance by @entity3 companies to join a temporary program			2
the opponents say they remain fearful that the program ultimately will hurt @entity5 trucking jobs			2
further , they said the inspector general 's report confirms fears the @entity5 government will not hold @entity3 trucks and truckers to the same safety standards as their @entity5 counterparts			1
" the inspector @entity56 report pretty much has confirmed everything that our organization has contended since @entity61 , " said @entity53 of the @entity54			0
the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) has applied a " double standard " to @entity3 operations , he said			0
the report says @entity62 auditors allowed @entity3 drivers to respond in @entity68 to test questions , and that some @entity3 drivers were unable to explain the meaning of signs labeled " @entity73 " and " @entity74			2
" and one @entity62 auditor did not investigate why one @entity3 trucking company submitted a report containing incomplete drug and alcohol tests			2
the @entity62 said it has taken steps to address problems uncovered by the inspector general			0
it now requires @entity84 responses to questions about traffic and road signs , and requires testing of all 21 signs used in the test			0
" safety is our first priority , and we will continue to look for ways to improve our program , " the agency said in a statement to @entity1			0
" the agency has already incorporated several important safety recommendations from the @entity99			0
" as for program participation , the @entity62 said it is working with the @entity3 government to provide program information to other trucking companies			1
" the agency recognizes that statistically valid results will require much broader participation , " the @entity62 told the inspector general			0
under the program , approved @entity3 trucks are allowed to carry @entity3 goods throughout the @entity5 -- well beyond the commercial zone in border states where they previously had to off - load			1
before receiving permanent long - haul authority , participants must go through a series of inspections and safety evaluations			1
the program is not open to hazardous material trucks or passenger carriers			0
to date , the @entity20 says , none of the participating @entity3 carriers has had a reportable crash in the @entity5 since joining the program			1
supporters of the program blame the low participation on the temporary nature of the program			0
" it 's a bit of a ' @entity135 ' because the @entity3 trucks have been yanked around so long they are hesitant to spend the money on a pilot program , " said @entity131 , director of the @entity133 's @entity132			1
" i think they are concerned about making an investment in something that might be temporary			0
" " many of them say , ' to hell with it			0
we have enough business in our own country , ' " @entity131 said			0
@entity131 dismissed concerns that @entity3 trucks were less safe than @entity5 rigs			1
" i think it 's a jobs concern disguised as a safety issue , " he said			0
" i mean they can frighten people by saying , ' @entity156 , they 'll have these old ramshackled trucks ( on @entity5 roads )			2
' " but , he said , that trucks " have to pass the exact same safety standards " as @entity5 trucks , and the drivers must be equally qualified			2
@entity3 outlines details of cross-border trucking pact			2

just six @entity3 trucking companies are participating in the program so far
as of july , @entity3 trucks had made fewer than 100 long - haul trips into the @entity5
@entity5 auditors must prepare a congressionally mandated study of the program 's safety
the auditors fear with so few participants , they wo n't be able to complete the study
