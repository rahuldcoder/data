@entity0 , @entity1 -- for 12 years , rabbi @entity3 worked at a camp for children battling cancer			1
he often witnessed the pain and discomfort many of them endured while undergoing medical procedures			2
" it 's really indescribable , what it 's like ... to watch a child go through so much pain , " said @entity3 , who served as the director of @entity13 in @entity14			1
" the child looks at you for help and then you end up having to hold them down			0
" one day , he tried to soothe a young camper who was screaming in pain during treatment			0
@entity3 , a black belt in @entity27 , offered to teach the 5 - year - old boy some of the craft			1
" in martial arts , you learn that pain is a message that you do n't have to listen to , " he said			1
" that lesson is so unbelievably effective			0
" @entity3 taught the boy some breathing techniques			1
when the nurse removed the needle after chemotherapy , he said the boy had hardly noticed			0
@entity3 realized he was on to something			1
" when we are able to breathe through pain and imagine the pain lowering , " he said , " the brain has an amazing capacity to put us into a different place			0
" in 1999 , @entity3 founded @entity46			1
the program provides free martial arts classes focused on breathing techniques and meditation for children battling serious illnesses			1
" when children get a diagnosis like cancer or any major disease , they lose any sense of feeling that they 're controlling their lives			1
they 're prodded and poked and touched , and they 're often so afraid , " @entity3 said			1
" we teach kids how to control their pain and make them feel powerful			2
" a personal journey @entity3 knows what many of the children 's families are going through			1
his first child , @entity69 , was diagnosed with leukemia a week before her first birthday			2
yet he was struck by his daughter 's positive spirit during the emotional time			2
" she was such an incredible little soul , " @entity3 said			2
" after very painful treatments , she would give the doctors a kiss and thank them			0
" in 1981 , after putting up a strong fight , @entity69 passed away at age 2			1
" she is our inspiration in everything that we do , " @entity3 said			2
through classes and one - on - one support , @entity46 has helped more than 5,000 children and their families			2
" we use martial arts as a platform for meditation , for relaxation , to allow children to gain these tools and to really face down so much of the fear and the anger and the junk that accompanies pain , " @entity3 said			1
the group provides individual support during hospitalizations and medical procedures			0
it also offers transportation to and from classes , as well as counseling			0
@entity108 joined @entity46 after she was diagnosed with cancer last year			0
the 9 - year - old used to run for the door when doctors attempted to administer her treatment			0
through @entity3 's program , @entity108 learned to control her fear and pain			1
" the way i breathe in the light is , i think of all the happy thoughts			0
and then the way i breathe out the darkness is i think of the bad thoughts and blow them away , " said @entity108 , who recently completed chemotherapy			0
" i do have the power to make the pain go away			0
" the program encourages children to teach what they have learned to other youths and adults experiencing sickness , pain or stress			2
@entity3 believes that when the children teach the breathing technique to others , the children find purpose in their lives			1
" when they demonstrate ( that ) you can bring in the light and let out the darkness -- the pain , fear and anger -- it changes people , " he said			2
for @entity3 , instilling that sense of purpose is especially important for children at the end of their lives			1
before terminally - ill children pass away , his group gives black belts to them , organizing ceremonies with their family and friends			0
the ceremonies are sometimes held in big auditoriums filled with hundreds of people , or they may take place in small @entity165 rooms with immediate family crowded together			0
" when we give children this black belt , we embroider the child 's name on one side and the words ' master teacher ' on the other , because they really are teaching the world , " @entity3 said			1
the organization began in @entity1 and has since expanded its programs to @entity14 , @entity178 and @entity179 and internationally to @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182			0
" i am so humbled by these children when they are able to face down big stuff , and you could see that light on their face , " @entity3 said			1
" i feel like their souls are shining			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity46 website at @entity191 and see how to help .			0
