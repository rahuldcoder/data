when the biggest cable company in the @entity3 buys the second - biggest cable company in the @entity3 , what does that mean for you ? if you 're afraid the answer might be a higher cable bill , you 're not alone			1
" @entity3 already hate dealing with the cable guy -- and both these giant companies regularly rank among the worst of the worst in consumer surveys , " said @entity8 , president and ceo of @entity10 , a group that advocates for diversity in media ownership			0
" but this deal would be the cable guy on steroids -- pumped up , unstoppable and grasping for your wallet			0
" on thursday , @entity20 announced it had agreed to buy @entity21 for $ 45 billion			1
if approved by the federal government , and that 's no sure thing , the two would become a massive cable giant , serving one out of every three homes in the @entity3			1
( @entity21 was spun off from @entity21 in 2009 and no longer has any connection to the owner of @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 ) obviously , it 's way too early to know whether the dire predictions of folks such as @entity8 will come true			2
but the announcement has raised a lot of questions along those lines for subscribers of both companies , as well as others curious how the emergence of such a cable giant would impact them			0
so here 's an effort to address some of those questions as best we can : when could this happen ? @entity20 says that if the merger is approved by federal regulators , they would become one with @entity21 by the end of this year			1
subscribers to the two companies should n't see any changes before then			0
if it 's any guide , @entity20 's acquistion of @entity56 was slowed down by the regulatory review process and took 13 months before it was completed in 2011			2
would my bill go up ? it depends upon whom you ask			0
as noted above , there are activists dedicated to fighting big media mergers on the argument that relying on a small handful of giant companies kills competition and drives up prices in any market			2
" an enlarged @entity20 would be the bully in the schoolyard , able to dictate terms to content creators , internet companies , other communications networks that must interconnect with it , and distributors who must access its content , " said @entity73 , senior staff attorney for online consumer activist group @entity74			1
" by raising the costs of its rivals and business partners , an enlarged @entity20 would raise costs for consumers , who ultimately pay the bills			2
" but some industry analysts say there 's no reason the merger would directly impact subscriber wallets -- at least no more than they 're already being hit			0
" i think this is more of a story about two companies wanting to get together to improve their market share and revenues for their stock price than it is for customers , " said tech industry analyst @entity97			1
" i do n't think this is a story about customers at all			0
" @entity97 noted that since @entity20 and @entity21 are largely in different @entity3 markets , the merger would n't mean a loss of competition			1
but that does n't mean cable bills wo n't go up , he said , because they 're already doing just that			0
" cable television prices have continually risen over time ; the price customers pay roughly doubles every 10 years , " @entity97 said			1
" i do n't see that changing			0
" how about service quality ? if history holds , subscribers to both companies could be in for some bumps along the way			0
" whenever there are mergers of two large customer - service providers ... we tend to see quite a few problems , " said @entity125 , managing director of the @entity126 , citing surveys about mergers between airlines , banks and other companies			0
he said problems could be caused by hiccups in merging customer database -- things such as double billing or accounts getting lost			0
" we 'd be surprised if a new hybrid @entity20 - @entity21 does n't produce a lower level of customer satisfaction for a year or two , " he said			1
" customers have felt burned in the past by large mergers where choice is effectively reduced			0
" and it 's not like a lot of people are in love with their cable service to start with			0
financial site @entity153 released a survey thursday in which 25 % respondents called cable companies the worst for customer service			0
that led credit card companies at 15 % , insurance companies at 14 % and phone companies at 12 % past gripes about cable - tv and broadband companies have focused on high rates and the difficulty of getting customer - service help over the phone , according to @entity126 research			1
many consumers now pay more for tv and internet service than they do for heat or electricity			2
consumers in most areas of the @entity3 do n't have a choice between cable tv providers , which makes them feel helpless when rates rise or service is poor , @entity125 said			1
would my cable offerings change ? in terms of services , this could be a win for @entity21 customers			1
if the deal goes through , @entity21 customers would likely be offered @entity20 's wider menu of channels and services			1
while @entity20 customers are n't necessarily satisfied all the time , a lot of its hardware and software has gotten high marks			2
in its announcement of the planned merger , @entity20 said that , among other services , it offers " 50,000 video on - demand choices on television , 300,000 plus streaming choices on @entity205 , @entity207 mobile apps that offer 35 live streaming channels plus the ability to download to watch offline later , and the newly launched @entity210			1
" if the merger goes through , @entity20 also would become the largest broadband provider in the @entity3			2
so @entity21 subscribers would presumably have new options on that front as well .			2

proposed @entity20 - @entity21 merger raises some concerns
some fear a massive cable company would mean higher rates for tv , internet
one analyst believes the move is more about market share
cable prices already are doubling every 10 years
