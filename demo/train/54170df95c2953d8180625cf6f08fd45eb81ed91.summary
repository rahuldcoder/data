@entity0 -- the surprise disclosure of an intelligence assessment about @entity5 's nuclear capabilities this week raised further questions over what the @entity7 believes the communist nation is capable of , and has kept the @entity7 , the @entity10 and the rest of the world on edge , worried about the possibility of an imminent missile launch			1
at a @entity20 hearing on thursday , rep. @entity17 , @entity18 , read from a declassified version of a document in which the @entity23 expresses " moderate confidence the @entity5 currently has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles , however , the reliability will be low			1
" but @entity28 , director of @entity7 national intelligence , quickly shot that assessment down			1
" @entity5 has not yet demonstrated the full range of capabilities necessary for a nuclear - armed missile			1
" still , many issues about @entity5 's nuclear capabilities remain unclear as @entity7 officials prepare for a potential missile launch by @entity37 that they say could come at any time			1
here is a look at a few of those questions : --- --- 1			0
does @entity5 have nuclear weapons ? likely			1
@entity5 conducted its first underground test of a nuclear weapon in 2006 , as well as two other tests , with the most recent coming in february of this year			1
others believe the communist nation is assumed to have already separated enough plutonium for up to 10 warheads			0
it is unclear , however , if they have developed a way to weaponize or effectively deliver them			0
a @entity7 official who briefed reporters in @entity57 said that @entity5 " has demonstrated at least three times now that they can detonate a nuclear weapon			1
" still , with fewer than 10 functional nuclear devices -- compared to the more than 7,650 warheads in the @entity7 arsenal -- the tiny nation is at the dangerous infancy of becoming a nuclear state			2
has the nuclear device been miniaturized enough to fit atop a missile ? unclear			2
taking a basic nuclear weapon and shrinking it down so it can fit on top of a missile is quite difficult			1
many experts have suspected the @entity5 have been working feverishly to do just that , but their success has not been confirmed			2
said the same @entity7 official : " miniaturizing a weapon is a very , very difficult task			2
" secretary of state @entity78 , responding to the initial @entity23 assessment , said that " it is inaccurate to suggest that the @entity5 has fully tested , developed or demonstrated capabilities that are articulated in that report			1
do they have missiles sophisticated enough to deliver a nuclear warhead ? possibly			0
the @entity5 are believed to have a host of rockets or missiles , either deployed or in development , that many believe capable of carrying a potential conventional , chemical or nuclear warhead			2
their long - range and unconfirmed @entity93 3 rocket has never been tested as a missile , but , with a suspected range of 6,200 miles ( 10,000 km ) , it could possibly reach parts of the western @entity7			2
their intermediate - range @entity97 and @entity101 rocket could cover @entity102 , parts of @entity104 and @entity105 and some @entity7 bases in the @entity107			0
and their short - range @entity109 , with a range of about 435 miles ( 700 km ) , would be a threat to @entity112 , @entity102 and @entity113			0
however , experts say their guidance systems are primitive and their propulsion systems are unstable			0
but the @entity7 official said they have capabilities			2
" they have demonstrated that they can launch a three - stage missile			0
we believe they are continuing to develop putting a nuclear warhead on top of an intercontinental ballistic missile or intermediate - range ballistic missile , " the official said			0
" i think it 's premature to say they 've been able to put everything together , from development of a warhead , launching it , getting it to re-enter and actually target something			0
i think that 's a little premature to say right now			0
if @entity5 launches a missile , how will we know if it is carrying a nuclear warhead ? basically , we wo n't			1
while @entity7 officials said there is " nothing to indicate " that @entity5 can or will place a nuclear warhead atop a missile right now , most experts say it is very difficult to know the warhead and payload of a missile test in advance			1
that raises the heightened concern that , despite public @entity7 proclamations that they would be hesitant to shoot down a @entity5 missile launched over the ocean unless it appeared to be heading toward a known land - based target , such a shoot - down is still possible			1
why is it so hard to know full details of @entity5 's nuclear program ? the highly secretive nation -- led by the young , reclusive @entity160 -- has been largely isolated from much of the rest of the world			2
subject to strict @entity167 sanctions , the country 's primary supporter has been @entity113 , to its north and west			0
entry into the country is strictly limited and communications -- tv , radio , @entity175 and even cell phones -- have been tightly controlled by the communist government			0
and even @entity5 's nuclear capabilities are unclear			1
months after @entity5 's latest underground detonation , @entity7 intelligence is still unable to determine what material actually exploded -- uranium or other radioactive materials			1
@entity184 , a former @entity1 correspondent who has visited @entity5 15 times , said the current confusion about @entity37 's capabilities recall a similar episode in 1998 , when @entity7 spy satellites discovered an underground complex at @entity191 , not far from @entity5 's main nuclear facility at @entity193			1
a debate raged inside intelligence communities about whether what the satellites saw was evidence of a burgeoning nuclear reactor , a secret , underground nuclear weapons facility or something else			0
in the end , the underground complex turned out to be empty , @entity184 noted			0
@entity1 's @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 contributed to this report .			0

with @entity5 on the verge of a possible missile launch , questions remain about its capabilities
disclosure of @entity7 intelligence hints @entity37 may be closer to nuclear weapon than *previously* thought
but senior @entity7 intelligence *leaders* quickly *refute* the intelligence assessment
