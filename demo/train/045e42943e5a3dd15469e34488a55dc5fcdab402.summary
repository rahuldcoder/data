-- on the surface , @entity3 senator @entity2 's proposal to reform the corporate tax code seems politically insane			1
the powerful chairman of the @entity7 has proposed tightening up the tax treatment of corporate profits overseas			2
the senator , along with legislators in both parties , wants to use this proposal as the basis for broader loophole - closing reforms that also tackle the individual tax code			2
given how difficult it has been to pass any piece of legislation in recent years , it seems impossible that @entity20 will muster the energy or courage to challenge powerful interest groups that benefit from the status quo and to reform the tax code			1
while loophole - closing tax reform might be good policy , it is hard to see how it can be good politics			1
" this is a big rock to push up the hill , " warned @entity32 democrat @entity31			0
but in fact there is reason to believe that tax reform might have a chance to pass			1
the proposal comes at a good time			0
@entity20 is stuck in the mud			2
as an institution , @entity20 needs a big victory			2
polls show that the approval ratings of @entity20 have reached all - time lows , now having fallen to an abysmal nine percent			2
although members of @entity20 tend to focus on their own electoral future , the public image of @entity20 has reached such a low point that the leaders of both parties are seriously concerned			1
when public disapproval of the institution is so strong , it creates the environment for a possible " throw the bums " out atmosphere in which all parties are at risk for an anti-incumbent election			2
nothing can boost the image of @entity20 as an institution like a reform that benefits the public interest over private interests			1
although achieving tax reform is extraordinarily difficult , @entity68 and @entity69 could walk away from a deal looking as if they were finally willing to take on the status quo in @entity73 and to defy the powerful interest groups who lurk on @entity76			1
this might be enough to bolster public attitudes about the @entity79 and @entity7 going into the next couple of election cycles			0
if @entity20 gores enough oxen , with both parties equally implicated in the reform , members could insulate themselves from the falloutâ € ” preventing one party from using this as an issue against the other -- and strengthen their standing with the electorate as a result			1
both parties also stand to benefit from tax reform because it remains one of the best ways to raise revenue without raising taxes			1
one of the reasons that tax reform has always attracted the interest of fiscal conservatives is that cleaning up the tax code of its loopholes quickly raises more revenue			1
most fiscal conservatives understand that serious deficit reduction is only possible through a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts			0
although the @entity115 has maintained a progressive tax code since 1913 , few upper income individuals or corporations pay the actual higher rates since loopholes diminish their obligations			0
occasionally , such as in 1969 and 1986 , @entity20 has closed loopholes as a way to raise more money to curb the deficit			1
unlike 1986 , this time the legislation would not be revenue neutral			0
the amount of money raised by closing loopholes would be more than the money saved by taxpayers enjoying lower rates , and that money could be used to help shrink the deficit			0
that could enable the grand bargain over deficit reduction that @entity68 and @entity69 have been unsuccessfully pursuing for years			0
as occurred when @entity137 was president in 1986 , tax reform was an issue that both parties had an incentive to support			1
for unpopular @entity69 , tax reform can offer evidence that the party is committed to fiscal responsibility and demonstrate that they are capable of governance			1
passage of the legislation would offer a contrast to the image that the party gained when it used the debt ceiling to try to force president @entity152 's hand on spending cuts			0
for @entity68 , tax reform can shift the national agenda away from the problems with the roll out of the @entity158 and toward a legislative accomplishment			1
finally , tax reforms can be one of the first tests of the post-filibuster reform @entity20			1
the @entity7 voted to prevent filibusters on executive and judicial nominations			0
they did so through a majority vote , establishing for the first time that a majority was sufficient to change the rules			0
many experts predict that this precedent might scare senators from using the filibuster as much as in recent years , fearing that the tool might be eliminated altogether			0
it is thus possible that tax reform would now only require 51 , rather than 60 , votes in the @entity7			1
president @entity152 could desperately use a victory like tax reform			2
as the chances for passing immigration reform diminish , and the possibilities of achieving progress on climate change are nil , tax reform might be one of the few areas where progress is possible			2
@entity137 scored a big victory in 1986 , one that remains a noted part of his record and legacy			0
unfortunately , over time new loopholes were created and there is a need for another around of reform			0
the president should seize the moment , to make sure that his second term is not solely defined by the bitter partisan battles over the budget and health care			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			0
