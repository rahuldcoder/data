-- @entity1 announced monday it might hold joint military maneuvers with @entity3 in the @entity4 , and the @entity5 said it is scrapping a once ballyhooed deal with @entity7 on nuclear technology			1
the declarations come in the wake of increased tension between @entity1 and the @entity5 over @entity1 's invasion last month of the former @entity14 republic of @entity15 , a @entity5 ally that aspires to join @entity17			1
@entity1 ships will make a port of call in @entity3 later this year and the two nations could hold joint naval exercises for the first time , both sides said			1
@entity1 denied there was any link between monday 's announcement and the conflict in the @entity29 , although @entity1 has criticized @entity5 support for @entity15 , and @entity3 president @entity31 has long antagonized @entity32			1
" this is a planned event unrelated to the current political situation and @entity38 developments , " @entity1 @entity34 spokesman @entity33 said monday			1
" the exercises will not be targeted against any third party			2
" the agreement on the @entity1 visit to @entity3 ports was reached long before the conflict in the @entity29 broke out , he said			1
but he appeared to suggest monday that @entity1 had proposed the joint naval maneuvers			1
" if the @entity3 side finds the proposal interesting and an agreement is reached , @entity1 and @entity3 may hold joint naval exercises in line with international practice , " he said			1
several hours later , @entity53 spokesman @entity52 said @entity32 is canceling the proposed " @entity54 " with @entity7 , which would have cleared the way for more trade of nuclear technology , services and goods between the two countries			0
he denied the pullout was directly linked to @entity7 's actions in the @entity29			0
" over a period of time , we 've had some deep concerns about @entity1 behavior			2
and quite clearly the president has taken this action looking at the facts , " he said			0
both countries had accepted the agreement and it was awaiting congressional approval			0
@entity1 foreign minister @entity74 warned in an exclusive interview with @entity0 last week that @entity1 would not be pleased at the collapse of the @entity54 , which is named after a section of the @entity5 @entity78			1
" this would effectively kill any possibility for our cooperation to promote the @entity84 initiative on nuclear nonproliferation -- which is important for the entire world , " he said			0
" as i said , it would n't be our choice , but if the @entity5 does not want to cooperate with us on one or another issue , we can not impose ourselves on @entity32			2
" but experts say @entity91 was unlikely to have given the deal a green light , and that the @entity94 was making the best of a bad situation			0
" i think [ the administration is ] making a virtue out of a necessity " by pulling out , said @entity1 analyst @entity97 of the @entity98 in @entity32 , last week			2
on the possibility of @entity1 - @entity3 naval exercises , @entity103 expert @entity102 warned against reading too much into the proposal			1
" the @entity1 have complained about @entity5 warships operating in the @entity108 , which is an area of intense interest to them			1
it would not be surprising if they returned the favor by having joint exercises in the @entity4 , " said @entity102 , a 25 - year foreign service veteran who ended his @entity53 career as chief of the @entity5 @entity113 in @entity114			1
" it 's a way of saying : ' two can play at this game			0
if you think you can send ships into the @entity108 without response , you are mistaken			0
' " but he said the mere fact of @entity1 ships operating in the @entity127 would not necessarily be dangerous			2
" the act itself is not			0
having naval exercises ? fine , as long as both sides take it for what it is			1
it 's not a threatening gesture , it 's a message			0
" @entity136 , a @entity103 expert at the @entity137 in @entity32 , said the announcement could be part of a complicated bargaining process , depending on whether relations improve between @entity7 and @entity32			0
" something tells me that soon enough something will happen to tone this down , and possibly this exercise with the @entity3 could be used to pull back on this issue , " @entity136 said			2
" if things improve [ the @entity1 ] could pull back as a sign of commitment to improving the relationship			2
if tensions remain i see the possibility that this kind of exercise would occur			0
" he said the @entity3 have little to contribute to a military alliance with @entity1			1
" they have a couple of destroyers , a couple of old submarines , and frigates that can launch surface - to - air missiles -- not anything sophisticated or robust			0
this would not be a robust exercise			0
it would be more about indicating strategic cooperation			0
" but he suggested that if the exercise does go ahead , it would be a sign of increased @entity1 confidence vis - a - vis the @entity5			1
" they feel they are strong enough and bold enough to do something in our sphere of influence , " he said			0
@entity178 spokesman @entity177 appeared to shrug off the announcement			2
" we exercise all around the globe and have joint exercises with countries all over the world ; so do many other nations , " he said			1
@entity31 said sunday that @entity186 was prepared to receive the @entity1 in late november or december , according @entity3 's ministry of communications			1
but he indicated @entity3 might not be prepared for military exercises by then			1
" we 're only in the planning phase			0
we 're not ready yet for the visit and the probable maneuvers to happen in september or october , or even november			0
so it could happen , if not at the end of november , then at the beginning of december , " he said			0
@entity33 said the @entity1 flotilla will include " the heavy nuclear - propelled missile cruiser @entity198 and the large anti-submarine ship @entity200			1
" the announcement comes only days after a @entity204 command ship , the @entity201 , arrived in the @entity15 port town of @entity206 in what the @entity5 called a humanitarian mission			1
the ship reached @entity206 on friday			0
@entity1 said the fact that a military vessel is being used in a relief mission raises concerns			2
@entity1 has become a major supplier of arms to @entity3 since 2001			1
the two countries signed a series of deals worth $ 3 billion in 2006 , including fighter aircraft , transport and attack helicopters , and assault rifles , according to @entity223 's , the defense intelligence publication			0
@entity31 visited @entity7 in july for his first meeting with new @entity1 president @entity226			2
@entity0 's @entity227 and @entity228 in @entity7 and @entity0 @entity53 producer @entity229 in @entity32 contributed to this report .			0
