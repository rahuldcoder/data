-- @entity1 , but this medieval romp is a strange and sorry beast , a one - eyed monster so starved of mirth it devours its own tail			1
insert a modern expletive or three in an affected @entity8 accent and that line gives you the gist of the film " your highness " and its one and only comic idea , which is to recreate the rollicking sword and sorcery adventures of yore , and punch them up with anachronistic vulgarities and stoner jokes			1
it 's not a very original idea			1
if you 've seen " @entity24 and the @entity25 , " or @entity27 's " @entity26 , " you might not be averse to it in principle			2
alas , " your highness " is n't a worthy comparison of such illustrious predecessors			2
this misbegotten enterprise 足 足 -- a collaboration too far between actor / screenwriter @entity34 ( " @entity37 " ) and " @entity36 " director @entity35 足 -- is such an egregious waste of talent it might send unsuspecting audiences rushing out to give " @entity43 " a second chance			0
maybe @entity45 's folly was n't so bad after all ? @entity46 and @entity35 go way back			2
the actor was credited as assistant director on @entity35 's first feature , " @entity50 , " and played a supporting role in his second , " all the @entity56 , " opposite @entity53 足 who plays the virgin @entity55 here			2
ten years ago these young filmmakers wanted to make art. @entity46 is sticking a dismembered @entity60 's sex organ in @entity53 's eager face			0
how far they 've come ! then there 's @entity63 , as @entity46 's good - looking older brother , prince @entity64 , and @entity65 as the bloodthirsty archer , @entity66			1
you might briefly wonder if the movie is n't some hideously elongated @entity70 skit gone horribly , horribly wrong , not least because @entity63 seems to be sleepwalking through this gig too			1
but even the @entity70 telecast seemed shorter in comparison			0
the pity of it is , there 's nothing wrong with the narrative framework			1
the brothers are forced on a quest to vanquish an evil warlock ( @entity82 , not so bad ) and save @entity55 from a fate worse than death			0
let 's note in passing , the film is also very handsomely designed by @entity88 ( " @entity89 " )			1
according to @entity46 , they pitched it as " @entity92 " meets " @entity93 , " which is a better one - liner than anything that found its way into the script			0
the old school special effects work is artful and amusing , with several affectionate nods to the influence of veteran stop - motion maestro @entity101			0
a five - headed dragon transfigured from a magician 's hand is especially ingenious			0
if they had only had the courage of their convictions and stuck with a tongue in cheek tribute to those innocent fantasy movies , they might just have had something here			0
but the relentlessly smutty , lazy and above all unfunny innuendos ( if a single entendre counts as an innuendo ? ) drain all the life out of it			1
as for the " @entity93 " reference , presumably that springs from the film 's @entity122 locations , but @entity124 must be spinning in his grave			1
@entity35 and @entity46 are talented and energetic enough to get past a misfire like this , but that does n't make " your highness " any less of a travesty			0
they should be royally ashamed of themselves , and at the very least , sent off to bed after a jolly good spanking .			0

" your highness " is a medieval romp starring @entity65 and @entity63
*reviewer* says there 's nothing wrong with the narrative framework
he also says the film contains relentlessly smutty , lazy and above all unfunny innuendos
