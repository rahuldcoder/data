@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 officials in @entity1 have launched an investigation into a raucous student protest at a board of trustees meeting in which campus police used pepper spray on demonstrators , sending three of them to a hospital , the college president said wednesday			1
the students were n't allowed into the overflowing meeting room tuesday evening and were demonstrating in a hallway against a summer pilot program creating two tiers of tuition when the pepper spraying incident occurred , said @entity22 , the multimedia editor for the campus newspaper who videotaped the incident			1
three people were taken to a hospital , and about 30 other students needed treatment for pepper spray , said @entity0 fire department capt. @entity31			2

a number of the protesters " engaged in unlawful conduct , " such as setting off fire alarms , but campus police " exercised restraint and made no arrests , " college president @entity44 said in a statement			1
he said the protesters in the corridor chose not to enter an overflow room			0
in all , about 100 people protested the board meeting , he said			0
" when some of these demonstrators used force to enter the board room proper , and had overrun the door and the personnel stationed at the door , there was one discharge of pepper spray used by a @entity5 police officer to preserve public and personal safety			1
unfortunately , a number of bystanders , including college staff , students and other police personnel were affected , " @entity44 said			1
" @entity5 regrets that a group of people chose to disrupt a public meeting in an unlawful manner , " he added			1
in march , the the two - year college 's board approved a summer session pilot program to self - fund extra courses in an effort to increase total classroom seats and provide a way for students to take courses they need , @entity44 said			1
the program augments 700 regularly scheduled state - subsidized classes at $ 46 per credit unit for @entity1 residents , he said			2
about 50 extra self - funded classes will be offered at actual cost , which translates to $ 180 per credit unit , or $ 540 for a typical three - unit course , he said			0
that cost " is far below the tuition rate at the state 's other public educational systems , " @entity44 said			0
" the college 's action comes at a time when @entity5 is confronted with the greatest budget crisis ever to face higher education in @entity1			1
" @entity1 has been grappling with a budget deficit that promises to result in massive cuts to higher education and course cancellations			0
tuition for the @entity104 rose 21 % this year , to just over $ 9,000 for in - state residents			2

if his plan to put a temporary tax increase before voters in november fails , education funding would be cut again			0
two students who said they were pepper - sprayed described campus police as overreacting			1
it started out just chanting and we 're getting our point across , " said @entity123 , 20 , who said an officer grabbed her neck			2
" things escalated with the campus police , and kids got pepper - sprayed and put in choke holds and thrown on the ground -- sent to the emergency room			1
" " i think if they were going to pepper - spray that we should have been given some kind of warning , " she added			1
@entity140 , 19 , said she was protesting the summer tuition pricing because " it 's very classist			1
" " it 's making the classes divide , and it 's going to cause more problems in the long run so it 's preposterous to me that this is even being considered a solution , " @entity143 said			0
she said the pepper spray incident , as well as the summer tuition plan , damages the school 's reputation			1
" it prides itself on being this diverse , progressive campus or whatever , and this completely stifles that reputation , " @entity143 said			0
@entity22 , the student journalist at the @entity162 campus newspaper , called the spraying incident an injustice			2
