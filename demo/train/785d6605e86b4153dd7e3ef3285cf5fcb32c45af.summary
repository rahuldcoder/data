@entity0 , @entity1 -- a crush of protesters covered the streets of @entity1 's capital tuesday in an anti-regime protest			1
tens of thousands of people marched in the biggest anti-government rally since the public disturbances in the island nation erupted last week , and chants of " @entity14 , @entity15 , only @entity1 " and " the regime must go " rang through the multitudes tramping across the center of @entity0			1
the turnout was led by ambulance workers involved in rescuing some of those injured in the assault by security forces last thursday on the @entity23 , which has been the epicenter of the @entity26 - dominated protest movement			1
the rally -- which comes after thousands of people attended a funeral for a protester slain last week -- was a massive display of popular scorn toward an embattled government working to forge stability			2
but it unfolded amid major gestures by the kingdom			0
@entity37 touted a " national dialogue " and urged @entity1 " to engage in this new process " and " move away from polarization , " a government statement said tuesday			1
the king has held meetings with opposition members , community leaders and businesspeople " from all sections of society " to pave the way for a formalized dialogue process			1
" the national dialogue is aimed at bringing to everyone in @entity1 the opportunity to contribute to @entity1 's future path of reform , " the statement said			2
the kingdom also ordered the release of a number of prisoners and closed cases against several @entity26 leaders accused of plotting against the kingdom , the country 's state news agency reported tuesday			1
that cleared the way for @entity67 , leader of @entity1 's largest opposition party , the @entity68 , to return to the country from @entity70			1
his aides said he was expected in @entity1 later tuesday			2
@entity67 's @entity68 is more hard - line than the opposition @entity73 , which includes 18 people in the 40 - member parliament			0
many members of his movement are opposed to the government monarchy , but @entity67 said he will support the protesters whether they want a " new system in a constitutional kingdom " or want " to change the regime			0
" @entity67 , who had been living in exile , had previously been detained by the government for campaigning for more democratic rights in the island monarchy			0
@entity1 last year asked the international police agency @entity88 for help in arresting @entity67 , whom the government accused of a terrorist plot to destroy state buildings and of planning a coup			1
but the king 's decision closed the books on the case against @entity67 , giving him the freedom to return without fear of arrest			2
an aide told @entity2 that @entity67 has been held up in @entity101 , where he was stopped and held by airport security and questioned for hours			0
the aide believes that this was because of the arrest warrant in september on charges of wanting to overthrow the government and he said that perhaps the wanted lists for @entity110 states have n't been updated			0
the king also is working to " ensure that sectarianism does not take root in @entity1			1
" young members of the country 's @entity26 majority have staged violent protests in recent years to complain about discrimination , unemployment and corruption , issues they say the country 's @entity15 rulers have done little to address			2
protesters initially took to the streets of @entity0 last week to demand reform and the introduction of a constitutional monarchy			0
but some are now calling for the removal of the royal family , which has led the @entity133 state since the 18th century			0
there were outbursts of government assaults on peaceful protesters last week , acts that drew international condemnation			0
the @entity1 government statement said that seven people had died during protests in the nation and 25 people remained hospitalized			1
protesters had given a higher death toll , placing the figure at 10 or 11			1
thousands of additional protesters moved into @entity23 on monday , a growing gathering that has taken on an air of permanence since government forces retreated on saturday and demonstrators reoccupied the symbolic location			2
tents , some of them outfitted with furniture and occupied by entire families , dot the epicenter of the @entity1 protest movement -- a setting similar to the one in @entity161 in @entity162 , where @entity163 staged daily demonstrations that led to the removal of president @entity166			0
the @entity167 says authorities launched a clampdown on dissent in late 2010			0
it accused the government of torturing some human rights activists .			0

thousands demonstrate in @entity1
the government releases a new death toll figure
the king releases some prisoners and closes cases against several @entity26 leaders
the move clears the way for return of an opposition leader
