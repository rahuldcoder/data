-- the ceo of a top research firm did n't mince words about @entity4 in a new blog post			1
" @entity4 will decline in the post @entity9 era , " wrote @entity6 , ceo of @entity7			1
" the @entity15 and @entity16 maker will coast for two to four years on its current momentum , @entity6 said ; but @entity9 , who died in october , left a void because his successor , @entity4 ceo @entity18 , does n't possess his star power			1
" [ @entity20 ] ithout the arrival of a new charismatic leader it will move from being a great company to being a good company , with a commensurate step down in revenue growth and product innovation , " @entity6 wrote			1
an @entity4 spokesman declined to comment for this story			0
the fade colony describes does n't appear to be on the immediate horizon			0
this week , @entity4 reported doubling its profits in the first three months of the year , largely on the strength of the 35.1 million iphones it sold ( a number that far exceeded predictions )			0
the company said it also sold 4 million @entity41 computers , 11.8 million @entity16 and 7.7 million @entity42 during the quarter			0
colony predicted that @entity4 's long - term fate will mirror that of onetime industry leaders like @entity46 and @entity47 when they lost enigmatic leaders , or @entity50 in the 20 years after @entity50 's death			2
in his post wednesday , @entity6 described @entity4 in almost religious terms			0
" @entity56 organizations are run by people with ' the gift of grace , ' " he wrote , citing sociologist @entity54			0
but when that leader is gone , shifting to a more bureaucratic leader ( which works for some organizations ) does n't translate well , he wrote			1
" in charismatic organizations , the magical leader must be succeeded by another charismatic -- the emotional connection of employees and ( in the case of @entity4 ) customers demands it , " @entity6 said			1
" @entity4 has chosen a proven and competent executive to succeed @entity9			2
but his legal / bureaucratic approach will prove to be a mismatch for an organization that feeds off the gift of grace			0
" colony pointed to @entity4 executives @entity76 and @entity77 as being better suited to run the company , saying they appear to possess the charisma and design sense to " legitimately " lead @entity4			2
@entity7 is a global technology research company founded by @entity82 in 1983 and is considered a leader in analyzing the technology industry .			2

@entity7 ceo says @entity4 needs a charismatic leader like @entity9
