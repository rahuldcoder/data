" elements in the draft resolution , including the right for @entity4 people for self - determination , a two - state solution with @entity38 as the capital of @entity41 and an end to what it calls @entity8 occupation were " acceptable not only to members of the @entity2 but to the international community as a whole , " @entity49 said			1
