-- from a distance , @entity1 is looking awfully good the last few days			1
first , we learned that members of the art group @entity5 would be released from prison under a new amnesty , then that the @entity8 30 , a group of @entity11 activists who spent two months in @entity1 jails , would be free to go			1
and finally , president @entity13 announced he would pardon @entity14 , the country 's best - known and longest - serving political prisoner			1
inside the country , things look a little different			0
a majority of the people facing the largest political trial in more than half a century , stemming from a may 6 , 2012 , @entity22 protest , will remain behind bars , as will @entity14 's business partner , friend and co-defendant , @entity24			1
sending different messages to the international and domestic audiences is precisely the point of @entity13 's latest maneuverings and of many of his policies generally			1
in an effort to make sure that the @entity35 in @entity36 in february go off smoothly , @entity13 is showing a friendly face to the @entity38 , demonstrating that he has heard the criticism directed at him			1
to the audience at home , the message is , protest and disobedience will be punished harshly			1
the stability of a democratic society depends in large part on its courts being perceived as just			0
dictatorships , on the other hand , need their judicial systems to inspire fear			0
nothing inspires fear like the arbitrary , selective application of laws			0
consider the @entity57 case , in which 27 people have been charged in connection with a protest that ended in violence -- mostly police violence -- last year			2
because they face a variety of charges , only eight will be amnestied , and the rest will remain under arrest			2
but there is no discernible difference among the defendants in this case -- all the charges against them appear unproven and unprovable			0
this is the very definition of the arbitrary application of laws			0
to be frightening , punishment must also be harsh			0
four of the @entity57 case defendants were released december 19			0
one of them has lost his eyesight in the time he spent in jail ; the others merely -- merely -- lost a year and a half of their lives , when they could not see their families or work to support them			0
at best , as punishment for taking part in a peaceful protest , they have had their careers interrupted and have run up back - breaking debt ; at worst , they have sustained irreparable damage to their health			2
and they are the lucky ones			0
the two members of @entity5 are lucky to get out of jail about two months before their time would have been up			1
they have spent more than 650 days in jail -- more than a third of each of their children 's lives -- as punishment for 40 seconds of lip - syncing in a church			0
at least one of them , @entity105 , has been subjected to physical violence , sleep deprivation and chronic undernourishment			0
both have sustained long and debilitating hunger strikes			0
@entity105 said that when she tried to speak out about conditions of her custody , prison officials threatened to beat her			2
prison officials denied the allegations			0
but they 've had it easy compared to former oil tycoon @entity14 , who once dared challenge @entity13 on the subject of corruption			1
for this , and for his general refusal to be subjugated , he spent more than 10 years behind bars			0
during this time , @entity14 refused , on principle , to discuss the conditions in which he was held , because they were no worse than that which hundreds of thousands of @entity1 's other convicts faced , but the details that have emerged are harrowing			1
more or less every time @entity14 gave an interview or published a piece of his own writing -- and he refused to be silenced in jail -- he was confined to punitive solitary			1
other than that , he has faced the standard fate of a @entity1 convicted felon : his life 's work has been ruined by the state , his children have grown up without him , and his parents have faced old age and life - threatening illness without him			1
for @entity13 , punishment -- no matter how harsh -- is not complete if it does not include humiliation			2
over the years , he consistently said that he would not pardon @entity14 unless @entity14 admitted his guilt			2
on december 19 he stated that @entity14 had appealed for clemency , and @entity13 's press secretary , @entity150 , added that the appeal included an admission of guilt			1
@entity14 himself , speaking from @entity154 , has said that " the issue of admission of guilt was not raised " in the discussion			2
but that did not stop @entity13 from using the occasion of his release to communicate yet again to the @entity1 people that not only will he punish his enemies -- he will not stop until they are finally subjugated			1
there is reason to believe that @entity14 was forced to accept emigration as a condition of being released from prison			1
it would behoove the international community â € ” including the 18 countries whose now - amnestied citizens were kidnapped in international waters in september and thrown into @entity1 jails for two months -- the @entity11 activists â € ” to pay attention to the message @entity13 is sending			1
his mercy is heavily conditional , while his fury is severe -- and his disregard for legality , close to complete			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			2

@entity13 pardoned @entity14 ahead of the @entity189
@entity187 : president is just *putting* on a friendly face for the @entity38
she says the message to @entity1 is protest and disobedience will be punished
@entity187 : @entity14 , @entity5 members are freed , but many *innocents* still in prison
