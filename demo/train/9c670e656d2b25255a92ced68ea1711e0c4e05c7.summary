-- want a hot tip about how to make a financial killing this year ? die			1
it sounds like a distasteful joke , but courtesy of the @entity7 , it 's a gruesome reality			0
because of a hiccup in the convoluted tax laws , @entity11 who have done exceptionally well for themselves during their lives will be able to preserve an enormously greater percentage of their money , and thus be able to pass it on to their heirs , if they die before midnight on december 31			1
the federal estate tax , for this calendar year only , is zero percent ; at the stroke of midnight on @entity23 it immediately goes to a potential 55 percent for people who have managed to build up a considerable nest egg for their families			1
the 55 percent rate will apply to everything after the first $ 1 million in assets , if the current law stands			2
( @entity7 still has the beat - the - clock option to step in and change the rules for next year , but so far has not			2
) the details of the back - and - forth in @entity7 that has led to this are enough to give you a headache , and those mice - trapped - in - a - maze legislative machinations have been exhaustively reported on and analyzed			0
suffice it to say that the smart people in the world of money and investments -- the ones who always seem to know when it 's time to move to municipal bonds , or to roll their cash over into some exotic derivative , or to switch to real estate -- are now saying that dying this year is a sound financial strategy			1
as the @entity54 recently put it : " it has come to this : @entity7 , quite by accident , is incentivizing death			0
" no one is kidding about the basic facts of this			0
the @entity62 scheme may have been unspeakably cruel , and the tricks played by the big investment banks may have been infuriating , but at least no one was telling people that they 'd better die quickly if they 'd like to let their families hang on to their money			1
the @entity54 ran a photo gallery of six prominent men who beat the system by dying this year : former tv host @entity72 , actor @entity73 , @entity75 founder @entity74 , novelist @entity76 , real estate developer @entity77 and author @entity78			1
the most - talked about beneficiary -- if you can call it that , which you probably should n't -- of this tax weirdness is @entity84 , the late owner of the @entity85 who died last month			2
under the headline " why now is a great time to die , " financial journalist @entity86 , who writes for @entity87 , calculated that by dying this year instead of next , @entity84 saved his relatives approximately $ 600 million			1
what do you call a system that allows such a thing to happen ? " grisly " is the word that tax expert @entity95 used when she spoke to @entity86 : " there 's talk about pulling the plug on people on life support ... [ it is ] just horrible to think that taxes should play any role in life - and - death decisions			1
" but the same people who knew how to play all the angles to build an enviable financial life for themselves are now coming face to face with the ultimate angle			2
as attorney and estate planner @entity114 told @entity116 : " if you 're super-wealthy , it 's a good year to die			1
" last year , when the estate tax was 45 percent , people in ill health faced a different kind of challenge : if they could just hold on until the first few seconds of 2010 , then they could die knowing that their money had made it into the freakish one - year holiday from estate taxes			1
but as sadistic as that setup was -- imagine having to fight for a few more breaths because if you made it to @entity131 , you could do a better job of providing for your children -- at least it put a premium on living			0
what 's scheduled to happen in a little more than four months is the opposite			0
those who die are the fiscal winners			2
there does n't seem much to be done about it , except engage in dark wit			0
@entity143 , 81 , of @entity144 , @entity145 , who founded a grain - bin manufacturing firm with $ 15,000 in 1963 and who has presided over it with such skill that today it provides jobs for 450 @entity153 , told the @entity54 that if he were to die this year he would not have to pay a penny in estate taxes			1
but if he were to live until the dawning moments of next year and then pass away , his bill could be $ 15 million			0
he seems to have a sense of humor about this insanity ( unless he 's not kidding )			0
he said : " you do n't know whether to commit suicide or just go on living and working			0
" that 's what is so @entity165 - through - the - looking - glass about all of this , and that is why , in its nonsensical way , the tax situation is a parable for the financial madness of our times			0
if you 've been fortunate in your life , and have accumulated a sizeable amount of money and property to leave to your children and grandchildren , and your health is starting to fail , you can hope for one more springtime with your family , and a seat in front of the television set to watch the @entity188 , and a chance to gaze upon the fireworks and the community parade next @entity192			0
but if you do , will you feel like a sucker ? will you feel like you 've wished for something foolish ? will you weigh the joy of one more year against the empty feeling of having your pocket picked by the lunacy of this particular law ? " happy new year , " for some people , may soon enough sound like a taunt			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			2

tax law eliminates estate tax this year , but *restores* it in 2011
@entity205 says some very wealthy people could save heirs millions if they die this year
@entity205 : will those who make it past december 31st feel that their families got cheated ?
