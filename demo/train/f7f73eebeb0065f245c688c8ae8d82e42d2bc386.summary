@entity0 is building a @entity1			1
two cities really , as the " two summers " theme shown in @entity3 of " @entity4 " suggests			1
one white , one black			2
one for the rich , one for the poor			1
one for private schools , one for closed schools			1
a new @entity12 for the saved and the damned			1
@entity14 heavens and low - end hells			0
it 's biblical , binary			0
the mayor 's new @entity12 is a second city for the first citizens who colonized the land and took it from the @entity20			1
the mayor 's vision is not for most chicagoans who live here now			2
it is not for @entity25			0
in last week 's " @entity4 " episode , principal @entity26 of @entity27 secures the early release of @entity25 , who she is mentoring			1
but he is re-arrested and becomes one of the thousands of black and brown bodies disproportionately locked up and routed into @entity33 's growing , often privatized , prison system			0
the mayor 's new @entity12 is not for black and brown and white workers who toil in multiple service sector jobs that the mayor 's neo-liberal economic advisers hail as job creation			1
in fact @entity0 and his advisers have been the proponents of a global economic policy that packs up the kind of blue collar jobs that built @entity12 and sends them south with ease : @entity0 championed @entity49 at the @entity50			1
the @entity12 that the mayor and his team of wealthy financiers are continuing to create and sell is a second city of tourists and grand inequities			1
the disparity gap grows between those who have and those who have to rent			0
those who can afford private schools like the mayor 's children and those whose public neighborhood schools are underfunded and tracked and given impossible and idiotic standardized tests to validate their existence			1
the new @entity12 is for new businesses that will be lured with tax - free incentives , gaining advantages they wo n't have to pay back in order to be responsible citizens			1
the new @entity12 is based on old @entity73 models of urban planning , concentric zones of wealth where working and poor people are pushed to the margins of the land and public discourse			1
the mayor is like a suburban kid back in the city with his parents ' money who wants to go to @entity87			2
when the list of 50 school closings in mostly black and brown neighborhoods was leaked , he was skiing on spring break in @entity92			0
this month when a group of poets from the @entity12 public high school @entity95 hoped to speak to the mayor directly at @entity97 : the @entity98 , he chose instead , the same night , to be on a giant swing at a $ 450 - a - ticket gala , eating a $ 1,000 priced meal , served by a celebrity chef			1
the slick series " @entity4 " glosses over issues such as economic injustice , white supremacy , the declining middle class and the school to prison pipeline			1
@entity12 on tv appears in a vacuum , rather than in the torrent of history			1
police chief @entity115 's stop - and - frisk policy is a continuation of @entity33 's long history of criminalizing and dehumanizing black and brown bodies			0
police force and presence in neighborhoods is sometimes the cause of violence and destruction rather than its cessation			0
@entity12 is , after all , the home of @entity126 , a @entity12 police commander who was fired for torture and later convicted of lying about the practice			1
it was also the home of @entity131 , an unarmed young black woman shot and killed by a @entity12 police detective			1
the mayor maintains systemic inequity and champions individual exceptionalism			2
in @entity3 , the gracious white mayor provides an internship for one young black man while his city locks up thousands			2
recidivism and the school to prison pipeline is the " real graduation " to paraphrase the most honest articulation of @entity3 from an interview with an unnamed prisoner			0
the dismantling of public education in @entity12 is a pathway toward a privatized school system living at the center of the @entity153 in @entity154			1
the mayor and his cronies are the architects of these blueprints concerned with standardized tests but not standards for every student 's academic success and environment			2
until they hold the system to the standards they demand for their own children , for all children , schools will continue to fail students they seek to teach			2
the mayor is not a mentor or educator			2
he is a millionaire businessman			0
in @entity3 , he walks around after - school programs patting black kids on the head like some king			0
he considers himself a white savior , but he is something antithetical			0
in @entity3 , he says he gives kids a second chance			0
but it is certain the schools and the city will fail students of color and send them to the largest jail in the country			2
chance , the incredibly gifted hyper - literate emergent hip - hop superstar at the center of @entity190 and at the center of a youth cultural renaissance in @entity12 , succeeds despite the school system he was suspended from and because of a strong two parent household , an informal network of aunties in the working class community of @entity199 , and a cadre of arts programs			1
those include @entity202 and @entity97 , where i serve as artistic director and had the privilege of mentoring the young rapper , where he was able to develop his voice and craft outside of the school day			2
chance is not an anomaly when it comes to the brilliance of young @entity215 and the contributions they have to share with the world			0
he is in the great tradition of @entity12 realist working class portraiture			1
chance is connected aesthetically and spiritually to @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 and @entity224 , when he rhymes on @entity225 from his mix - tape " @entity226 " : round here we lose best friends like every week i like to think we playin ' a long game of hide and go seek and one day maybe ... i could lead them kids of the @entity235 singing about freedom ... as @entity12 goes , so goes the country			1
and we are here fighting for freedom , for all , for every person from every zip code			0
we are fighting for the soul of the city , the soul of the country			0
we are building again , indeed , a second city , as we derive our nickname from the ability to rise after the ashes and great fire of 1871			0
@entity215 have the ability to rise like a phoenix			0
this is a testament to the resiliency of hard working people everywhere , not the backroom dealings of a millionaire mayor or his posse			2
we are the city of the eight - hour workday and the @entity262 martyrs			0
the home of @entity264 and @entity265 , home of @entity267 and the mothers of @entity269			0
a city of genius and gangsters			0
this is a writer 's and fighter 's town as @entity277 would say			0
and this is a fight to counter the mayor 's vision of a future city , of two cities			1
we are trying to write and fight for a united city , a different city			0
a new city , a city anew , a city for all			0
