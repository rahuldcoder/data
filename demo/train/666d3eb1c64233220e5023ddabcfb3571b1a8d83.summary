thanks to solar wind blowing out from the sun in all directions at a million miles per hour , material from comets gets whipped back into a formation that looks like a tail			2
now , scientists know that our solar system has a tail of its own , with a surprising shape			1
@entity14 researchers working with data from the @entity16 announced wednesday they have for the first time mapped the solar system 's tail , called the heliotail			1
their study is published in the @entity22			0
by " tail , " scientists do n't mean a furry appendage hanging off @entity26 , which is not classified as a planet anymore			0
rather , the tail is a stream of solar wind plasma -- charged particles -- and magnetic field , trailing off behind the heliosphere			1
the heliosphere is a magnetic bubble that surrounds our solar system , as well as the solar wind and our sun 's magnetic field			1
this bubble does n't stop at the planets -- it extends at least 8 billion miles beyond them			0
these new observations help scientists better understand the structure surrounding our solar system			1
" scientists had always presumed that the heliosphere had a tail			2
we 've seen it around other stars , we know the sun is moving relative to interstellar gas , " said @entity50 , @entity16 mission scientist at @entity14 's @entity51			1
" but this is actually the first real data that we have that gives us the shape of the tail			2
" if we could look at a cross-section of the solar system 's tail , its shape would resemble a four - leaf clover			1
the " leaves " on the side are composed of slow - moving particles from lower energy solar wind , and the leaves on the top and bottom are fast - moving particles from high - speed solar wind			0
on its " front , " the heliosphere is more bullet - shaped , but it is asymmetrical because of the influence of magnetic fields from interstellar space , said @entity83 , lead author on the paper and principal investigator for @entity16 at @entity86 in @entity87 , @entity88			1
these magnetic fields from outside the solar system also affect the shape of the heliotail			1
@entity83 compares this to putting bungee cords around a beach ball and pulling on them			0
the force of the magnetic fields squeezes the tail so that its cross-section becomes flattered like an oval			1
the tail 's cross-section also becomes twisted , and turns to align with the magnetic field			2
pressure from the interstellar gas and magnetic field causes the solar wind to bend back along the tail			2
researchers have not established the length of our solar system 's tail , but they believe that it fades at the end and blends in with the rest of interstellar space			1
astronomers had previously determined that other stars also have tails around their magnetic bubbles , which are called astrospheres			0
in order for such a sphere to form , there must be a balance of an inward compression of interstellar gas and a wind from the star that pushes outward			0
the @entity16 probe does not take photographs with light			1
instead , it makes use of what are called energetic neutral atoms			0
most matter in the universe has an electric charge on it			0
but sometimes a charged particle , while moving fast through space , picks up an electron from neutral gas , which turns it into a neutral atom			0
some of these neutral atoms are pointed back at @entity150 and are detected when they hit the @entity16 spacecraft			0
" because they travel pretty much straight , you can trace them back to where they came from , and make a picture with these atoms instead of light , " @entity50 said			0
" that 's what @entity16 does			2
" there are no space probes currently moving down the tail of our solar system , but the two @entity169 spacecraft , which launched in 1977 , are still floating further from @entity150 than any other terrestrial - made objects			1
the @entity169 and the @entity16 missions are complementary , @entity83 said			0
the @entity169 probes are akin to biopsies of the solar system , while @entity16 is more like an mri , understanding the big picture			1
" while we have incredibly good and valuable information from those two locations where we have those spacecraft , how to put those into a global context and understand the really three - dimensional global interaction of the sun with the local part of the galaxy is really more a job for @entity16 , " @entity83 said			2
according to the latest observations reported in the journal @entity190 , @entity169 has traveled more than 11 billion miles from the sun. that brings it closer to reaching the distinction of being the first human - created object to reach interstellar space , which is loaded with material from other stars and a magnetic field from elsewhere in the @entity200			0
scientists say @entity169 may take several more months , perhaps years , to fully escape the solar system			2
@entity203 is still relatively closer to home , at 9 billion miles from the sun. @entity16 has enlightened scientists as to what the @entity169 mission may find at the far reaches of our solar system and beyond , @entity83 said			1
without the interstellar probe , some say they would n't be able to make heads or tails of it			0

@entity14 's @entity16 probe has new information about our solar system 's tail
interstellar magnetic fields influence the shape of the tail
the magnetic bubble around the solar system is called the heliosphere
