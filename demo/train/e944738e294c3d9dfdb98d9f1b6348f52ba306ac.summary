i 'll let you know what 's going on , but i do n't need new congressional authority to act , president @entity0 told congressional leaders wednesday about his upcoming decision on possible military intervention in @entity8			1
the @entity10 meeting sounded more like a listening session for the top @entity12 and @entity13 in the @entity10 and @entity14 about options for helping @entity8 's embattled @entity17 government halt the lightning advance of @entity20 fighters toward @entity21 that @entity0 is considering			1
according to a @entity10 statement , @entity0 went over @entity24 efforts to " strengthen the capacity of @entity8 's security forces to confront the threat " from the @entity28 in @entity8 and @entity29 ( @entity30 ) fighters , " including options for increased security assistance			1
" earlier , spokesman @entity34 spelled out one limit to any @entity24 help , saying : " the president has n't ruled out anything except sending @entity24 combat troops into @entity8			1
" while the @entity10 statement emphasized @entity0 would continue to consult with @entity42 , @entity14 @entity12 leader @entity40 of @entity41 said the president " basically just briefed us on the situation in @entity8 and indicated he did n't feel he had any need for authority from us for the steps that he might take			1
" @entity40 @entity50 of @entity51 agreed with @entity53 's assessment , adding she believed congressional authorization for military force in @entity8 back in 2001 and 2003 still applied			2
@entity0 " did not give us an array of actions he was planning to take , " @entity50 said			2
" he just talked about his perspective on what was happening there			0
" a few hours earlier , defense secretary @entity62 and @entity64 chairman gen. @entity63 said they were working out details on possible @entity24 steps that could include airstrikes on @entity20 militants advancing through northern @entity8			1
' full range of options ' " i share alarm about the future of @entity8 , and we are developing a full range of options to help stabilize the region , " @entity63 said at a @entity14 subcommittee hearing wednesday			2
he and @entity79 noted that final details , especially for airstrikes requested by the @entity8 government , required more intelligence on the @entity30 fighters whose lightning sweep of @entity20 territory has raised the specter of a partitioned @entity8 and a broader @entity17 regional war			1
they agreed with subcommittee members that the @entity8 crisis amounted to a threat to @entity24 interests in the region and , down the road , a possible threat to the @entity24 homeland if northern @entity8 and neighboring @entity29 become a safe haven for @entity100 - affiliated @entity99			1
@entity101 sen. @entity101 of @entity102 , a conservative hawk critical of what he considers to be a weak @entity24 foreign policy under @entity0 , noted that @entity30 fighters have threatened to attack the @entity24			1
' high - risk scenario ' " although currently a regional threat , they do have aspirations to attack @entity114 interests , " @entity63 said , calling the safe haven outcome outlined by @entity101 a " high - risk scenario			0
" " yeah , to our homeland being attacked by this group , " @entity101 countered , to which @entity63 responded , " not at this time but over time			0
" when @entity101 asked about possible @entity24 airstrikes on the militant forces , @entity63 confirmed reports that the @entity8 government had requested them and added that it was " in our national security interest to counter " the @entity30 fighters " wherever we find them			1
" at the @entity10 , @entity34 made clear that @entity0 's " ultimate objective " was to protect @entity24 national security interests and prevent the region from becoming a safe haven for @entity30 extremists			1
" any action that he might contemplate when it comes to ... the use of military force will be to deal with the immediate and medium - term threat posed by @entity30 , " @entity34 said , noting that 170 @entity24 military personnel have been sent to @entity21 to assist in securing embassy personnel inside @entity8 , while another 100 moved into the region to " provide airfield management security and logistic support , if required			1
" like other administration officials , he referred to the militants by the abbreviation for the @entity30 , rather than the common translation of the name that includes @entity29			0
a draft list of possible @entity30 targets in @entity8 is being constantly reviewed and revised with the latest intelligence , typical of any preliminary targeting operation , according to @entity24 military officials who spoke on the condition of not being identified			1
compiling the draft list does not signal that @entity0 will authorize such strikes , and several administration officials said the president has yet to make a final decision			2
manned reconnaissance several military sources also confirmed to @entity160 the start of manned reconnaissance flights over @entity8 to collect up - to - the - minute intelligence on @entity30 movements and positions			2
unmanned reconnaissance flights have been going on for several days			0
in order to use precision - guided weapons , satellite coordinates generally would have to be loaded into them well in advance			0
that means the @entity173 needs to be ready to move quickly if @entity0 announces a decision to strike			0
the " kinetic " option against @entity30 targets could include dropping precision - guided bombs from manned aircraft flying overhead , using @entity180 cruise missiles fired from @entity182 ships in the @entity183 or using drones to fire missiles			0
military officials told @entity160 that the drone option was considered the least desirable because they fire against relatively small specific targets such as vehicles or individual suspected terrorists			0
for days , military sources have said @entity30 fighters are dispersed and mixed in with local populations , making them difficult to target precisely with airstrikes			2
@entity195 political fight on @entity198 , political leaders who later met with @entity0 sparred over the @entity8 crisis in a debate intensified by the hyperpartisan atmosphere of an election year			2
house speaker @entity203 demanded that @entity0 lay out a " broader strategy " for how the @entity24 should deal with the growing sectarian violence in @entity8 when he and other top congressional leaders meet with the president at the @entity10			1
@entity203 sidestepped a question about whether he supported airstrikes and said it 's up to the president to lay out what to do next			0
" i 'm looking for the overall strategy that will help secure the gains that we have made , " @entity203 said			0
meanwhile , senate majority leader @entity216 spoke out forcefully against sending @entity24 service members into the middle of sectarian strife			0
" this is an @entity8 civil war , and it is time for @entity8 to resolve it themselves , " the @entity221 @entity220 said on the @entity14 floor			0
" it is not worth the blood of @entity24 service members			0
it is not worth the monetary cost to the @entity24 taxpayer			0
" militants ' advance threatens @entity234 in @entity8 opinion : @entity237 's amazing chutzpah on @entity8 @entity24 and @entity238 : from sworn enemies to partners on @entity8 ?			2

president @entity0 says he 'll consult with @entity42 on @entity8
@entity10 spokesman *reiterates* that combat troops are ruled out
@entity64 chairman says @entity8 has requested @entity24 airstrikes
military planners warn of difficulty in targeting @entity30 fighters in northern @entity8
