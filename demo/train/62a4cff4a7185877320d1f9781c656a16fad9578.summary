a man who fell from a @entity5 cruise ship off the coast of @entity7 , @entity1 , was rescued by a @entity9 cruise ship after passengers spotted him on the water , @entity1 authorities say			1
" the man was traveling in the @entity13 ( of the @entity14 )			1
it was early in the morning			0
he does n't remember how he fell			1
fortunately , another cruise , the @entity20 , saw him , " said @entity18 captain @entity17			1
the lucky man , a 22 - year - old @entity23 citizen , had been in the water for about five hours during last thursday 's ordeal , @entity21 said			1
" at 7:31 a.m. a passenger aboard @entity20 reported a man in the water			1
the passenger had thrown multiple lifesavers in the water to help him , " said @entity21			0
" they rescued him and gave him medical attention			0
" the man was taken to a local hospital and was in good condition before he was flown back to the @entity23 , @entity21 said			1
" this man was reborn			2
most people that experience that kind of fall break their neck			0
it 's like hitting concrete , " he said			2
@entity46 caught on camera @entity48 , a @entity20 passenger , recorded the rescue			1
in his video , a yellow rescue boat bobs on dark ocean waters , and a man 's head and arms are barely visible above the waves			1
the man then swims toward the boat and is brought aboard			2
" we were in our stateroom			0
on the speaker system , we heard the crew saying ' @entity63 , starboard side			2
' i got dressed and went up to the upper deck , " @entity48 said			0
@entity66 is the code used for " man overboard			2
" when @entity48 reached the @entity20 's upper deck , the ship 's crew had already lowered the lifeboat			1
" it was pretty surreal at first			0
it 's not something you expect when you go on a nice cruise , " @entity48 said			1
" our first question was , where did he come from ? we thought it was someone that fell off our ship			1
" @entity48 said he spoke to the passenger credited with spotting the man in the water			2
" his daughter had gotten up , and they had a room with a balcony			0
she wanted to sit out there , and he went with her , " @entity48 recalled			0
" they heard a noise , and as the ship got closer , they realized it was a man screaming for help			1
they got on the phone with guest services , and the ship came to a stop			2
" safety at sea ? @entity5 closed - circuit tv video showed the man was alone on the @entity13 ship @entity109 when he went overboard at 6:07 a.m. " there were no other guests or crew around at the time , " said @entity114 , a @entity5 spokeswoman			1
@entity2 's request for the video was denied			2
@entity13 is one of the world 's largest ships , with room for more than 8,000 passengers and crew			1
it had departed from @entity123 , @entity124 , on january 3 , and @entity7 was the last port of call , @entity114 said			1
the ship 's safety features include a minimum safety railing of 42 inches and more than 1,200 security cameras			1
" for their ( passengers ' ) safety , we recommend that guests not lean over or climb on any railing , " said @entity114			2
but @entity138 - based maritime lawyer @entity137 says these measures are not enough			0
instead , he advocates automatic man overboard detection systems			2
" this poor guy was pretty lucky			0
the real issues is why he fell off the ship and why there is no clear explanation , " @entity137 said			1
automatic man overboard detection technology uses radar and sensors to establish a perimeter around a ship			1
a mechanism notifies the crew when a person has fallen overboard			0
one manufacturer of these systems , @entity157 , boasted a 95 % man overboard detection rate			0
the @entity159 requires large passenger ships to " integrate technology that can be used for capturing images of passengers or detecting passengers who have fallen overboard , to the extent that such technology is available			0
" unlike this incident , @entity137 said , the problem with most man overboard cases is that the person is never found and the case goes unsolved			0
" there are some people who commit suicide , " he said			0
" the suicides are easily detected because the person leaves a message or does n't bring any luggage onto the ship , or they sell their homes , et cetera			0
but there are a whole group of cases that do n't fall on the suicide pattern			0
there are other cases which we suspect are a result of foul play			0
" a website that tracks man overboard cases , @entity194 , listed 243 cases since 1995 .			0

@entity7 authorities say the man was at sea for about five hours
it 's not known how he fell from the @entity5 ship , @entity13
@entity20 cruise passengers heard the man screaming for help
