@entity0 , @entity1 -- after threatening web companies for more than a decade , @entity3 and his patent - holding company @entity4 — named after the @entity6 word for knowledge — may be finished			1
an eight - member federal jury in @entity1 deliberated thursday for just a few hours before concluding that all of @entity4 ' asserted claims of ownership to technology allowing access to the interactive web were invalid			1
that means the three upcoming trials that were scheduled to rule on infringement and damages , for @entity20 , @entity21 and other companies , have been canceled			0
the eight defendant companies who resisted the lawsuits wo n't pay anything to @entity4 or its partner , the @entity28 , for using the web			1
@entity4 maintained its patents entitled the company to royalty payments from just about anyone running a website with " interactive " features , like rotating pictures or streaming video			1
the chief issue in the case was whether the first computer program that allowed access to an " interactive web " was created by the little - known @entity42 biologist @entity3 , who runs @entity4 out of @entity42			1
or was it one of the web pioneers put on the stand by the defendant companies — such as @entity47 and his @entity49 browser , or @entity50 and his tag ? the dueling teams of lawyers have spent millions creating elaborate presentations , trying for the last three days to convince a jury of average folks in a federal district court in eastern @entity1 that their side was right			1
if the jury had upheld the patents , there would have been a potentially brutal damages phase in which @entity20 , @entity63 , @entity21 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 would have been sued for infringement and been asked for more than $ 600 million in damages , with the majority of that coming from @entity20 and @entity21			1
the @entity4 patents were denounced for years before this week 's landmark trial , but managed to survive repeated re-exams at the @entity76			1
however , thursday 's verdict is likely a setback @entity4 ca n't overcome			1
it may well be appealed , but that will be a long process , and in the meantime @entity4 wo n't be able to go after new targets			1
after the trial , judge @entity84 visited with the jurors a while , as is his custom			0
they were awed , i 'm told — as they often are — why such an important web case ended up in @entity0			0
apparently they were a little star - struck by @entity95 , although you certainly could n't tell during trial			2
at " @entity99 's on the @entity100 " opposite the courthouse , defense lawyers were celebrating			2
there was a giddy atmosphere ; these folks truly felt like they saved the @entity105 today			0
as for the winner 's reactions : @entity21 spokeswoman @entity108 said : " @entity21 is pleased with the outcome of the case and the jury 's decision , and we thank the jury for their time and commitment to this case			2
@entity21 respects intellectual property and will continue to protect its freedom to operate by defending itself against meritless claims			0
" @entity20 spokesman @entity122 was less effusive			0
" we are pleased that the court found the patents invalid , as it affirms our assertion that the claims are without merit , " @entity122 said			0
despite winning , @entity64 declined to comment			0
lead @entity4 attorney @entity129 did not return a call seeking comment			2
as for the many companies that settled with @entity4 , they might be regretting that pragmatic decision in light of the verdict			2
those companies include : @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 ( bought by @entity151 while this litigation was underway ) , and @entity153			0
