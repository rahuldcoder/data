this week , we 've been treated to the increasingly familiar sight of former @entity3 star and provocateur @entity2 attending events in @entity6 , @entity7			1
it 's his fourth trip in less than 12 months			2
on tuesday , an angry @entity2 defended his visit in a @entity12 interview straight from @entity6 , at one point saying to " @entity15 " anchor @entity14 , " i do n't give a rat 's ass what the hell you think ... " in response to question about @entity22 , an @entity23 detained in @entity7			1
when will we tire of this circus ? in case you do n't watch cable news , you might miss that the media really loves this kind of thing			0
no story about @entity7 is too weird to go unreported , even if there is no real information to disseminate			2
recall the recent rumor that @entity35 's uncle was executed by being fed to hungry dogs , which most likely was started as satire on @entity39 social media but was at first reported widely in the media ( @entity12 was unable to confirm and did not report the story )			1
in media discourse , @entity7 is the classic enemy			2
the regime 's injustices , quirks and dysfunctions are reassuring to @entity23 that their own country is just the opposite : @entity50 , well - functioning , a land of peace and liberty			2
but add in @entity2 to the @entity7 story , and it 's bound to produce eye - popping headlines : the @entity57 goes to @entity59 story is just too easy not to cover			1
@entity2 himself seems to be thriving on finding a strange smidgen of relevance through his visits to @entity7 ( and perhaps a @entity65 paycheck )			1
though often described as quite shy , he has always enjoyed challenging the values of @entity67			0
@entity7 is providing him a new avenue to be in the spotlight			1
the most passive player in this tragicomedy is @entity2 's home country , the @entity23			1
the @entity73 has deployed the rhetorical equivalent of an embarrassed teenager whose dad has shown up to dance at his prom			0
something along the lines of " this has nothing to do with us " is what the @entity73 has said with every one of @entity2 's trip			1
last winter , the @entity73 criticized @entity2 's timing as it followed a nuclear test and rocket launch			1
this time , it has merely said a private individual can do what he wishes			0
this is an understandably cautious position			0
after all , @entity2 has professed his love and undying affection for @entity35 , and he is probably not a canny enough operator to spearhead any form of political outreach along the lines of the " @entity96 diplomacy			1
" on this trip , @entity2 addressed the unavoidably political nature of a relationship with @entity7 , saying his visits could " open the doors " to " talk about certain things			1
" in the @entity12 interview , he argued that it 's a " great idea for the world			1
" @entity2 's celebrity status and sporting prowess has given him access to @entity35			1
at some point , when both the @entity23 and @entity7 governments are feeling a little brave , perhaps they can try to thaw the ice with more professional diplomats tagging along on cultural or sporting exchanges			2
for example , the @entity23 - @entity39 @entity96 diplomacy of the 1970s had its genesis in table tennis player by the name of @entity122			0
once he broke the ice , the governments began talking			0
the kind of engagement that @entity2 is pushing can not always be seen as merely rewards for a naughty regime , as much as we appear locked into a carrot - and - stick way of thinking about relations with @entity7			1
it can be mutually beneficial			0
we have the potential to gain as much as they do			0
breakthroughs might be sudden and surprising , but they are usually underpinned by creative thinking , dialogue and the mutual acceptance that no one can get exactly what they want			0
unfortunately , this particular trip does feel somewhat like a gift , coming as it does on @entity35 's birthday and less than a month after the violent and very public purge of his uncle and second - in - charge , @entity147			1
had @entity2 pulled out or delayed , the channel for opening may well have closed			0
if he really is in it for the long haul , he probably could n't afford to slight the leader on his birthday			0
domestically , it is great pr for @entity35			2
he gets to appear gregarious and inclusive in front of his people			0
notwithstanding @entity147 's execution , this is the image he has been assiduously cultivating			0
he 's eager to promote his friendly , approachable image while at the same time enjoying watching some former stars play his favorite sport			0
for now , little will come out of @entity2 's visits other than extraneous news			2
but as @entity6 continues to devote resources and energy to sports development , its appetite for athletic exchanges will increase			0
let 's warily hope , to use @entity2 's phrase , that this can " open the doors " to other things .			2

on @entity12 , @entity2 defended his visit to @entity7 , saying it 's a good idea
@entity181 : visit puts @entity2 in the spotlight and is good pr for @entity35
he says this kind of engagement can not always be seen as reward for a naughty regime
@entity191 : while this trip feels like a gift for regime , it may pave way for *future* diplomacy
