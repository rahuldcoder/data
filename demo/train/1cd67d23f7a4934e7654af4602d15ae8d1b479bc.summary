-- the craziest thing about @entity3 's tiger - blood - soaked , " winning ! " meltdown — er , " melt - forward " ? now that the crazy is nearly two years in the past , the ex- " @entity8 " star is actually ashamed of his behavior			1
( well , some of it , anyway			0
) when @entity13 asked last night if @entity3 ever feels embarrassed when he thinks back on the spring of 2011 , the actor answered the question quickly and matter - of - factly : " of course			1
have you seen some of those interviews ? that stuff 's out there forever , man			0
" that said , @entity3 still seems proud of his very public crackup 's sheer audacity			2

) and despite @entity3 's wishes , it seems unlikely that @entity58 creator @entity58 — the man @entity3 once called a " sad silly fool , " an " a-hole p --- y loser " and a " low rent , nutless sociopath " — would welcome his ex-star back into the fold			2
after all , the ghost of @entity68 has already appeared on " @entity8 ; " he was simply played by @entity69 instead of @entity3			1
