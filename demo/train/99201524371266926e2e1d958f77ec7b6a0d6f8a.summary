-- at first glance the @entity1 may seem like any old talent show			1
singers perform live on tv , the public and special juries vote , and at the end of the night a star is born			2
but do n't call this " @entity10 " or " @entity11 "			2
this is reality tv on steroids			2
every year around 40 nations from @entity15 to @entity16 field a musical act , each singing an original song in front of a huge television audience			1
as part of the @entity25 festival of kitsch , some contestants sashay across the stage in barely - there dresses , and shriek into wind machines with the force of hurricanes			0
pyrotechnics , fire , and massive led screens are de rigeur			0
it 's a big draw			0
in 2013 more than 180 million viewers in 45 countries tuned in to the action			0
this year 's final takes place on may 10 in @entity43 , @entity44			1
although officials describe @entity1 as a non-political event meant to unite @entity47 through song , politics inevitably colors the voting and the performances			1
@entity53 , a @entity1 expert and the editor - in - chief of @entity55 , the popular @entity1 website , has been in @entity44 for the buildup since late april			1
" @entity1 is about music , but it 's also about identity and nation branding , " he says			1
" the artists and their songs become symbols of the countries they represent			1
" this year is no different			1
tensions over @entity66 are already coloring the perception of acts from @entity69 and @entity70			1
during the semi-finals on may 6 , some of the audience inside @entity43 's @entity75 booed the @entity69 act , a pair of 17 - year - old twins called @entity78			1
" months of frustration over @entity69 's illegal annexation of @entity66 and @entity82 's anti-lgbt laws have left @entity25 angry , " @entity53 says			1
" the booing was a release , a statement of solidarity with @entity70 and @entity69 's sexual minorities			0
" it does n't help that @entity69 's love song features lyrics that some see as hinting at a border incursion : " ... living on the edge , closer to the crime , cross the line , one step at a time ... maybe there 's a day you 'll be mine			0
" in the past , @entity69 has relied on support from voters in the former @entity103 bloc			1
those votes seem less certain this year			2
@entity69 's loss could be @entity70 's gain			0
@entity107 , this year 's @entity70 act , will sing a song about love called " @entity111			2
" her act features a man running inside a giant hamster wheel			0
the act is not explicitly political , but in press conferences @entity117 has stressed that her goal is to show that art is stronger than politics , and that music lasts longer than warring politicians			2
it 's not all about @entity69 and @entity70			0
during the semi-finals , the act from @entity128 featured women in traditional dress churning butter and washing clothes as a woman rapped about @entity136 women : " @entity137 and butter taste so good / we will prepare for you delicious food / our beauty is famous all over the world / you got ta see it for yourself and then you will know			2
" " @entity128 , one of @entity47 's economic success stories , is celebrating its 10th anniversary in the @entity145 , " @entity53 says			0
" their song is a brilliant parody of @entity128 stereotypes , and a rebuke to all those who view @entity128 as backwards and behind - the - times			0
" in the past officials have disqualified songs with explicit political messages			1
in 2009 , the @entity155 was forced to pull its entry " @entity157			0
" it was a clear poke at @entity69 's president @entity82 in the wake of the 2008 @entity160			0
creative license allows other songs with political messages to slip through			1
in 2011 the @entity165 entry , which translated as " the struggle is the @entity167 , " was a call for @entity165 to fight against the government 's planned austerity measures			0
it became an anthem of protest during the financial crisis			0
political leaders , particularly those in the @entity177 , see the @entity1 results as a matter of international standing			1
last year , when @entity16 failed to give any points to its political ally @entity69 , the @entity16 president ordered a vote recount and the foreign ministers of two countries convened a meeting in @entity188			1
riding a wave of sympathy , @entity70 has emerged as one of the bookies favorites to win this year			2
that wo n't sit well with authorities in @entity188			0
nor will the reality that televoters in @entity66 may still be counted as @entity70 by their mobile phone companies			1
" when the points are counted and the hair extensions come off , one government is going to be very disappointed , " @entity53 says			0
" this is n't just a song contest			2
it 's a battle in the war			0
" opinion : the soft politics of @entity1			1

the @entity1 is one of the most watched *non-sporting* events in the world
every year around 40 nations from @entity15 to @entity16 *participate* in the competition
this year tensions over @entity66 could *spillover* into the contest
in the past officials have disqualified songs with explicit political messages
