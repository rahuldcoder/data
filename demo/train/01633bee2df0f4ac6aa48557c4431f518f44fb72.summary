-- there is no mystery to the popularity of the @entity5 series " true detective			1
" solid writing , excellent acting by stars @entity10 and @entity11 and the greatest of all tv currency these days : positive social buzz			0
the first season of the series ended sunday night and was apparently so popular that it crashed the @entity5 to go app during the time it was on ( full disclosure : @entity5 is owned by @entity0 's parent company )			2
for those fortunate enough to watch the episode , there was plenty of debate as to whether it was a satisfying ending to a thrilling eight episodes			2
@entity29 writer @entity28 noted that " it was a lot to take in -- an hour that veered more towards philosophy than final - act thrills ( although it had plenty of that , as well )			1
" that publication 's tv critic , @entity36 , wrote , " culminating a remarkable first season in fine , moving form , ' true detective 's ' finale , titled ' form and void , ' took us to the heart of darkness at the vortex center of its weird fiction -- as well as the final stage of its meta - commentary on the stories we tell ourselves , about ourselves , for better and worse			1
" @entity53 's @entity52 found some flaws in the ending even as he said , " true detective was an artfully written , remarkably acted , stunningly visualized portrait of @entity58 and @entity59 trying to find the path in an overgrown world of decay			1
" " ' true detective ' was the closest thing @entity66 tv has done in a while to the @entity70 model of drama , a story told in one season , from the keyboard of a single writer ( and the lens of one director ) , " @entity52 wrote			1
" there was nobody to dilute the creator 's perspective , or to call b.s			0
a more collaborative show , in the typical @entity66 model , might have fixed many of its problems			0
" the @entity87 took the approach of having a " round table " of writers discuss the season finale			1
@entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 each weighed in with their thoughts on the show 's wrapup			0
@entity94 said she " vowed to watch the finale as a fan , not as someone trying to figure it all out			2
" " but even as a fan , i still found these dangling threads and implausibilities frustrating because the show practically begged us to get into the weeds , to wade into swampy waters , " @entity94 wrote			0
" that 's okay if it winds up giving viewers some extra insight			0
but it 's another thing entirely if the show is just messing with us			0
" the show attracted plenty of famous fans also			0
@entity117 tweeted , " i can now say that @entity56 had the best first season of any show i 've ever seen ... " and according to his @entity122 account , actor @entity120 was scrambling to find somewhere to watch the show in @entity123 and finally lucked out			1
" @entity125 thanks to @ sarajeanhughes and @ josiahhughes for opening up their home to me so i could watch the true detective finale , " he tweeted			1
