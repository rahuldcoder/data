-- check your ground beef before you grill out this @entity4 weekend			1
the @entity6 's @entity5 says stores in nine states may have received beef contaminated with @entity10 : @entity11			1
the service announced this week that 1.8 million pounds of ground beef products were being recalled because they could be contaminated			1
the federal agency has since named retailers that may have received the tainted products			1
some are as follows : @entity19 stores in @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 @entity30 's @entity29 in @entity31 , @entity20 @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity24 @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity25 what government tests found in your meat a representative for the @entity40 @entity6 said the meat is being removed from store shelves			1
but consumers should return or throw out meat that has the code @entity45 and a production date between march 31 and april 18 , 2014			2
the ground beef is sold under a variety of labels , according to the @entity6 , but comes from @entity51 in @entity52			1
" while none of the @entity51 product has tested positive for the pathogen implicated in this outbreak , the company felt it was prudent to take this voluntary recall action in response to the illnesses and initial outbreak investigation findings , " @entity53 , a spokesman for @entity51 , said in a statement			2
eleven people across four states are suspected to have been sickened by the product , according to the @entity6			1
ten of those people were sickened after eating at restaurants that received contaminated meat			2
but federal officials say regulations prohibit them from naming those restaurants			0
" people who were exposed were already exposed , so it does n't help the public to tell them now that a certain restaurant was associated with these illnesses , " said @entity72 , assistant administrator for the @entity73 at the @entity6			0
" our job really is to identify product that may still be available			0
" according to what officials received from the company , he said , the meat went to many states			2
yesterday , it was on the order of nearly 40 states , but we do n't -- that number changes			2
that 's part of the process too , is to identify where the food -- the meat in this case -- was actually distributed , " @entity72 said			0
a list of stores released wednesday is not final , a @entity5 representative said			1
more establishments will be added as the @entity6 continues its investigation			0
the recall was categorized by the @entity5 as " @entity103 " : a health hazard situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious , adverse health consequences or death			1
@entity10 is a large group of bacteria that live in the intestines of people and animals , according to the @entity116			1
certain strains cause gastrointestinal illness in humans , with symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea			0
an estimated 265,000 infections occur in the @entity40 each year , the @entity116 says			0
people usually get sick three to four days after ingesting the bacteria and recover on their own			0
young children , pregnant women , the elderly and people who have weakened immune systems ( like cancer or @entity133 patients ) are at greater risk for severe illness and death			2
the best way to avoid getting sick is by washing hands frequently when preparing food and avoiding cross-contamination by washing cutting boards , counters and utensils with hot , soapy water			0
properly washing hands after using the bathroom and after coming into contact with animals or being in their environments -- anywhere there may be traces of feces -- also helps			0
cooking meats thoroughly to at least 160 ° @entity155 kills the bacteria and prevents infection as well			0
using a meat thermometer will most accurately help you determine that the food is thoroughly cooked			0
@entity161 : do n't get sick from your picnic @entity5 officials said in a news release that the agency is continuing to work with state and federal public health partners on the investigation and provide updated information as it becomes available			1
