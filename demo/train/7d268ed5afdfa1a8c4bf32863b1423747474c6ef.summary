-- only in the extreme world of big - mountain snowboarding could someone cheat death in an avalanche and realize it had reaffirmed their love of the powder			1
but perhaps it is n't surprising when @entity11 describes his relationship with nature as a need , or a drug			1
it is also a synergy that provides solace in the wake of bitter disappointment , such as finding out your @entity22 dream is finally over			2
" this huge avalanche took me 2 km down the mountain , " the @entity24 tells @entity0 's human to @entity26 of the moment he feared nature had finally beaten him			1
" it was one of these perfect days and you forget that in a split second , things can change radically and then , suddenly the whole mountain broke around me			1
" it is a miracle that i survived because i was lying on top of six meters of snow , completely broken with blood coming out of every hole in my body and completely unconscious			1
" unsurprisingly , that near - death experience six years ago launched a wave of introspection			1
" i asked myself for months whether i should keep going or not , whether what i was doing was stupid , " the 34 - year - old says			1
" i realized that i loved it even more than i thought and but i 've always had these rules in my head to be more scared about everything all the time , but at the same time being a lot more focused			2
" i think that right now , if i am freaked out about safety i will do no compromise			2
if i do n't feel something , i 'll just go back home			2
" @entity57 's discipline is boardercross -- essentially , a race from the top of a mountain to the bottom between a clutch of snowboarders			1
he is a four - time world champion , a three - time winner of the overall @entity65 title and has three @entity67 gold medals to his name			1
the only thing missing from his portfolio of prizes is an @entity73 medal , having fallen short in 2006 and in 2010			2
this particular dream is destined go unfulfilled -- after dedicating the past year of his life to making next month 's @entity76 , a mix - up over qualification points saw him fall short of the benchmark			1
" it was really disappointing to get the news as this was going to be the end of my boardercross career , " he explains			1
" after four world champion titles , three @entity67 medals and three crystal globes , it would have been an amazing way to leave the sport , but it has been a hell of a lot more brutal			1
" the good thing about everything is that my true place in snowboarding , as well as my heart , is in the high mountains riding powder			2
i am more fit than ever , and i guess this blowup is a great way to start from scratch			2
" i feel a lot lighter in a way , with no pressure			0
all that energy i have been gathering really makes me look towards my future adventures			0
" there are plenty more to come			0
chief among them is continuing production on his own films , with expeditions to @entity111 , in @entity112 , and @entity113 scheduled , as well as a commentary stint in @entity115			0
watch de @entity117 's ' @entity116 ' it is clear this connection @entity120 feels with the mountains is not something that can easily be shaken			0
" @entity124 is many things for me but most of all , snowboarding is what shapes my life in a way , " he says			0
" @entity124 is what has taught me to know myself			0
" @entity124 is what has taken me to the most glorious times of my life but also to the worst times of my life			0
" i think it 's just my own tool to experience life , to push myself , to know my limits , to maybe go over my limits sometimes and to be a happy and fulfilled human being			0
@entity140 take on the planet 's steepest peaks " if i 'm in a big city for a while , i start to feel nervous and i know that i need to go back somewhere where there is nothing , where i can touch a tree or a rock or something and then i feel better			1
" @entity57 thrives on the thrill of competition -- he describes boardercross as like " motocross " on the snow , as six people battle over a course filled with jumps and obstacles to reach the foot			1
but he is just as happy in splendid , snowy isolation on top of a mountain			1
" you see those big mountains that are far away and so unreachable , " he says			1
" ever since i started snowboarding and skiing , i looked at them and dreamed of getting up there and being up there on my own and even riding them			0
yeah , the dream came true			0
" i think if i had to describe one feeling that really stands out above everything ; it 's the one moment when you 're at the top of the mountain , ready to drop in			2
" you 're on your own , you 're far from everything , and you 're in a really strong element			0
" it 's amazingly beautiful and there 's something that happens in your head , it 's like time does n't matter anymore			0
your daily problems just vanish and it 's indescribable			0
" born in the @entity187 , @entity57 started skiing at the tender age of two			1
his four brothers and sisters also took the slopes at a young age , and his brother @entity193 looks set to make the @entity24 team for @entity115			1
but though a medal at the @entity196 was his final wish on the competitive side of the sport , he believes boardercross has evolved into a discipline that has maybe pushed the boundaries too far			1
" i think now that the sport has changed , " he says			2
" the young guys are hungry and they 're willing to win at any price			0
" i 'm going to sound like an old wise man but i miss the good old times where we used to respect lines , where we used to have a gentleman 's code			0
" right now , it 's just full battle with no rules , in a way			0
" but even if @entity120 's boardercross days are over , there is plenty more big mountain snowboarding to be done			1
" it 's a way of kind of getting a bit of control over the mountains but still being humble , asking permission in a way to access it and to ride it and to get this huge immense pride and happiness at the bottom , " he explained			0
" everything is recorded in your head and you just go into automatic mode			0
you 're just in a sort of bubble and you do n't feel anything , you 're just like an animal			0
" once you 've gone through all the hard bits and you 're straight - lining down towards the end , you get this fire exploding inside you			2
