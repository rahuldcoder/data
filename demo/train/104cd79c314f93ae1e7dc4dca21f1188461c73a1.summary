steps on the moon , @entity2 's finances accounted for a staggering 4.41 % of the @entity11 federal budget			0
in the last two years , that figure has dropped below 0.50 % for the first time since 1960 , and with the long , slow decline in funding has come an equally steady slide in the @entity11 government 's appetite for space exploration			1
two years ago , many commentators were proclaiming the end of the space age			1
the contention seemed hard to dispute : in 2011 , @entity2 's @entity24 program was permanently retired when the @entity25 touched down to the @entity26 in @entity27 , after completing its final voyage			0
around the same time , plans for a @entity11 - manned mission to @entity31 were shelved , and steps were put in place to decommission the @entity34			1
but as governmental funds have dried up , amateur space enthusiasts around the world are reviving humanity 's interplanetary dreams through crowd - researched and crowd - funded space projects of their own			1
the idea of crowd funding , where a large number of individuals pledge a small amount of cash towards a big project , may not be new , but it has been given a new lease on life through websites such as @entity53 , which help people with innovative ideas reach a global audience			1
to date , @entity53 has helped fund films , video games , electronics and more			0
recently though , @entity53 , and other sites like it , have begun to be used to fund missions to the final frontier			1
to date , many of these projects have been relatively modest in scale and ambition , with sorties only as far as @entity69 's low orbit			0
but some are attempting to recapture the spirit of president @entity73 's potent 1962 speech : " we choose to go to the moon			0
we choose to go to the moon in this decade			0
" the most ambitious and headline grabbing of them all is a new crowd - researched venture to send a manned submarine to @entity81 's ice moon , @entity82			1
yes , you read that right			0
the fledgling mission hopes to take an amphibious vehicle farther than humanity has ever traveled before , to dive deep into the freezing oceans of @entity82			0
at the moment , the project simply aims to connect people around the world to begin researching the mission -- funding for the operation will come much later			1
@entity95 is the man behind the audacious scheme			0
@entity95 has spent the last five years working on crowd - funded rocket projects alongside his business partner @entity99			1
their organization , @entity100 , has grown from a two - man team into a volunteer army of 45 full - and part - time collaborators with an annual crowd - sourced budget of around $ 400,000			1
@entity82 is regarded as a suitable destination for human exploration due to the commonly held theory that beneath its icy surface lie great oceans of water in liquid form			0
scientists suggest that @entity82 is one of the most likely locations in the @entity117 to be capable of hosting extra-terrestrial life			0
some have postulated that microbial life akin to that found in @entity69 's deepest oceans may already exist there			0
so compelling is this possibility that the @entity125 is planning a mission to send a robot to @entity82 in 2022			2
for @entity130 though , sending robots into space holds no interest			2
" if you send a piece of equipment to a part of space then you did n't actually go there ... robots are stupid mindless machines			1
they are not curious , they do n't come up with ideas or solutions			0
" @entity95 's project is not without its critics			2
in an article on the online tech magazine @entity147 , @entity148 , a professor of astrophysical and planetary sciences at the @entity150 , says : " what 's the point of sending humans ? what can they do that robots can not do better ? and robots do not need to breathe , eat , drink , excrete or come back			2
and robots have better bodies , eyes , hands , noses , ears -- and brains			0
" @entity95 's understands the criticism , but says that working towards a manned mission to @entity81 's moon fulfills another critical purpose : to inspire			2
he says that inspiring people is essential to kickstarting the kinds of discussions he hopes the operation will produce			0
" if we had talked about putting a solar panel into the sky , i guarantee we would not have got a dime in crowd funding			2
you need to have both the human and the pioneering aspect to attract interest			0
" away from @entity82 , @entity95 and @entity99 have aimed to muster this same enthusiasm to build support for their project to send a manned rocket into space			1
the @entity190 designer estimates that with the support he has received online , the project could come to fruition by 2020 : " we are in a completely different age now , " @entity95 says			1
" you can reach everybody around the world			0
with the internet you can share your thoughts and ideas immediately and you can send money around the world			2
@entity100 would n't be possible if you did n't have the internet			1
everybody is able to join forces			0
" other projects have found similar success online			2
aerospace engineer @entity206 hit the fundraising target for his project to launch a hundred micro satellites after just two weeks			1
his experiment aims to test the communication capacities of small spacecraft , as well as determine how long they can stay in orbit and how well their electronics hold up in the harsh environment of space			1
the @entity219 graduate is looking forward to seeing his project launch in december			1
one of @entity222 's former research associates , @entity223 , has a similarly ambitious project called @entity225 that allows anyone to buy into a mission to send a thousand tiny spacecraft to the moon			1
investors will be able to track their small ship , from its design and construction through to launch and onward to the moon			2
@entity223 says that the project is about " democratizing interplanetary space exploration			1
" he hopes that experiments such as this will help build a new enthusiasm around space research			2
" we 're building new tools , " @entity223 says , " so that one day every child will be able to send their own spacecraft on a robotic field trip in space			1
" talking about his own project to @entity0 , @entity222 said : " i think that crowd funding is enabling new types of missions to be flown - smaller , cheaper , and riskier missions - that may not have been funded under traditional models			1
it is not going to replace the multi-billion dollar national space programs			2
those programs , in fact , did the basic research that has enabled the current crop of crowd - funded space projects , including my own			1
the kind of sustained long - term research that governments have traditionally funded is still very much needed and i hope that it continues			1
" @entity95 agrees , adding that his own work is only possible because of research that has already been done by governmental space programs : " we are standing on the shoulders of , well , everyone , " he says			2
the work being done by this new breed of innovative crowd - funded and crowd - researched projects allows people around the world to actively get involved in space exploration			1
@entity95 and others like him want to inspire not through mounting monolithic projects that are out of reach , but by opening the process up and inviting people to get involved			0
" if they want , our donors can come to @entity190 and see the test of our rocket engines for free			0
many like to do that , but most are just happy to be a part of the project			0
they find it important , and they find it interesting to follow ... that dialogue is very important			0
