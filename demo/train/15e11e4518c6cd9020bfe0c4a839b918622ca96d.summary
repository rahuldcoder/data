@entity0 , @entity1 -- twelve jurors must decide whether the marriage of a @entity6 soap opera actress to a @entity1 pizza delivery man was a fact built on love or fiction designed to fool immigration agents			1
the question is apparently not easy for jurors who told the judge late wednesday that they needed to return for more deliberations thursday			1
their answer could send the couple to prison			2
jurors can compare the tearful testimony of the actress proclaiming love for her husband to evidence that she engaged in a romance with a photographer less than a year after her wedding			1
the prosecutor argued @entity29 paid @entity30 $ 5,000 to be her husband in june , 2005 so she could get a @entity32 work visa			1
" why would anybody have to be paid to marry her ? " asked defense lawyer @entity33 , pointing to the beautiful actress - singer - model			1
@entity29 and @entity30 were both 23 when they had a @entity0 wedding			1
only the bride 's mother and a handful of others attended , but @entity29 said a larger wedding was impossible because he is a @entity44 and she 's a devout @entity45			1
there was no honeymoon , which special assistant u.s. attorney @entity48 argued was evidence of a sham marriage			2
" you 'd figure they could go somewhere , @entity55 , @entity56 , " @entity48 said during closing arguments wednesday			2
they did have pictures together , which the prosecution suggested were staged to show immigration officials who would decide on her green card			2
when immigration agents conducted a surprise " bed check " at @entity29 's @entity0 apartment in october , 2007 , they found her , but not him			1
they found @entity30 at a @entity70 apartment , they testified			0
@entity29 testified that she really loved @entity30 when they got married and she intended to build a life with him			1
the first months were " very loving , fun , " she said			0
" we socialized together , passionate			0
it was the honeymoon stage			0
" but his drinking and late - night cavorting split them just seven months after their wedding , she said			0
" we started to fight a lot , sweat a lot , throw things			0
" her defense lawyer argued jurors only have to conclude that the marriage was real when it began			2
" there are all kinds of marriages , " @entity33 said			0
" no one else knows if people are in love			0
" the case is unusual because marriage fraud charges are usually litigated by immigration authorities rather than prosecuted as criminal cases			0
@entity32 district judge @entity101 blocked the defense from using much of the evidence they said would show it was only investigated because @entity29 was turned in by a vengeful photographer angry that she rebuffed his romantic advances			1
she met @entity109 at a @entity70 casting call about the same time her marriage was " on the rocks , " she said			2
@entity109 , a 49 - year - old @entity114 native , is the star of his own reality tv show , @entity117 's " @entity115			0
" @entity29 said the relationship initially was " professional and creative , " but she eventually engaged in a " short affair " with @entity109 as he helped with her modeling career			1
" i felt very pressured and i was vulnerable , " @entity29 said as she cried			1
" it was the biggest mistake i 've done in my life			0
" her friendship with @entity109 turned into a nightmare when she decided to end the affair , she said			0
" mr. @entity109 wanted more and more and he knew i was n't able to give it to him , " she said			0
@entity109 threatened to turn her in to immigration officials , she said			0
" he was losing it , he was very psycho , " @entity29 said			1
" i was very scared , because he would n't stop			0
" the federal complaint against @entity29 said the immigration investigation began after agents were given evidence gathered by a private detective hired by @entity109			1
when @entity109 testified for the prosecution last week he said it was " completely incorrect " that his motivation was to get @entity29 deported			1
instead , the investigator was gathering evidence to be used in a lawsuit against @entity140 , the founder and owner of the @entity143 fashion company , @entity109 said			0
the criminal complaint named @entity140 as a target of the federal investigation , alleging that he helped arrange the sham marriage while @entity29 was modeling for his company			1
@entity109 said his lawyer turned the evidence over to the government only because he feared @entity109 might be extorted by @entity140			0
" my case has never been against @entity29 , " @entity109 said after his testimony			1
" i wish her the best			0
" they could get between 15 and 21 months in prison if convicted , though such cases usually produce shorter sentences , according to the prosecutor			0
@entity29 's show business career began in @entity6 at age 16 when she joined the ensemble @entity163 , her @entity160 biography says			1
the group toured @entity6 and @entity166 , releasing two top - 10 singles , it says			2
she started hosting television shows and appearing on commercials in @entity6 when she was 18 , it says			2
@entity29 has appeared in print and tv ad campaigns for @entity143 , @entity174 and @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 , it says			2
" she was cast in @entity182 's original production ' @entity183 , ' where she was not only a lead actress , but also a lead singer , performing two songs in the soap opera 's soundtrack , " her online biography says .			2

jurors told the judge wednesday they needed more time to decide
