-- noted for his versatility and breadth of achievement , @entity2 opera singer @entity1 is one of the most respected baritones performing in the world today			1
the 56 - year - old , who hails from @entity9 , in @entity10 , boasts a discography of more than 150 albums , winning him multiple @entity13 , two @entity14 and the coveted @entity15 -- the highest award for musical recordings in @entity18			1
the grandeur of opera houses , tail coats and melodramatic librettos is a far cry from the thatched huts and sweltering sun of @entity28 's traditional @entity27 townships			1
but this is where @entity1 chose to land for his @entity31			1
he was there to seek out famed @entity34 vocal group @entity33 , whose mix of low rumbling harmonies and ululating riffs gained worldwide appreciation when the group appeared on @entity42 's seminal @entity41 album in 1986			1
during a 10 - day visit , the all - american opera singer was challenged to produce a fusion of sound that blended the diametrically contrasting traditions of western classical music with @entity33 's distinctive take on ancient @entity27 melodies			1
in his own words , this is the story of @entity1 's journey			1
@entity1 : i come from a very different musical tradition to the members of @entity33 , but i believe that anyone who stands next to another person and sings is somehow a brother , somehow a sister -- and rarely have i felt this more acutely than on my journey to @entity28			1
it was my first time there and what i saw of the city was beautiful			0
after landing i was struck by the deeply brushed low - lying hills and surrounding tundra , and the bustling atmosphere of the huge port			2
we traveled to the @entity75 township , to the former home of @entity77 ( leader of the group )			0
his old township is on the outskirts of @entity28 and while , of course , there are many signs of modernization -- like new homes and roads -- the area still carries a distinctive sense of its @entity27 roots			1
the people made a strong impression on me			0
they are physically very attractive and all seemed to have a wonderful sense of humor and warmth			0
it was in this spirit that @entity77 and the band welcomed me with open arms and a song -- i could n't have wished for a better introduction ! see also : @entity105 star takes inspiration from @entity108 dance @entity33 showed me the room where the group gathered to rehearse as young men , and the stage on which they first stood to compete in local singing competitions			1
we went on to see a traditional @entity27 wedding ceremony and i saw the modest village dwellings -- the circular huts -- the likes of which most members of the group would have called home as children			1
i 'm glad we had this experience before we started making music together			0
i spend so much of my time in life understanding other people 's ideas , getting into their language , their music ... their dna			0
this is not something you can just imitate			0
it seemed to me that in the @entity136 , music is part of everyday communication			0
their speech has a percussive rhythm , the intonation of the words creates a melody			0
see more : fusion journeys we eventually began rehearsing in the garage of @entity77 's current home			2
we all got in a half circle and sang to each other for a couple of hours			0
just that simple : i sang their stuff , they sung mine and we 'd say " how did that go again ? " one of the most interesting parts of this process for me was seeing how all the members of the group would work off each other -- responding and reshaping each other 's words as they sang , instantaneously mixing tone and intonation to create new sounds			2
of course , as an opera singer i 've now sung in 11 or 12 languages , but how many people get to say that they 've sung in @entity27 ? a few hours together and a beautiful melody is starting to take shape			1
we decided to document this wonderful experience and collaboration against the stunning backdrop of @entity28 's @entity177 -- where our final performance took place			2
we began with a @entity27 piece -- and perhaps @entity33 's most iconic hit song -- " @entity182			1
" the song is about the violence and displacement of @entity186			0
what i find enchanting about it , and other @entity33 pieces that speak of pain and suffering , is that it still sounds so full of hope			1
i can tell you all the members of @entity33 have suffered incomprehensible loss in their lives , and yet none of their music ever feels angry or spiteful , it is always rich with love			2
i found that very inspiring			0
for my song , i selected an old @entity2 parlor piece called " @entity202			2
" it was enthralling to perform such a melancholy number with @entity33 's deep soulfulness added to it			1
how would i describe my journey looking back ? i just put on their clothes for a period of time , but i wo n't even pretend that i can now walk in their shoes , make music the way they make music , sing how they sing			0
it is tempting to contrast the formal , intellectual way that much western classical music expresses emotion with the mystical , organic way that we hear with @entity33			2
but this , i think , is an over-easy simplification			0
we 're musicians , we have different wells but we all draw from the same river			0
would i go back ? in a heartbeat .			0
