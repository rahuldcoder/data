-- the @entity1 expressed rare public anger wednesday in blasting the leaking of private papers from the pope 's apartment , a scandal that observers say lifts the lid on a secret power struggle going on behind the closed doors of the @entity12			1
a top @entity12 official called the theft of the documents " an immoral act of unprecedented gravity " and " despicable abuse of the relationship of trust that exists between @entity21 and those who turn to him			1
" archbishop @entity23 made the remarks to the @entity1 's official newspaper six days after the pope 's butler was arrested for leaking the papers			1
@entity29 , 46 , was arrested wednesday on accusations of illegal possession of confidential documents , the @entity1 said in a statement issued three days after the arrest			1
with the leaks , the pope 's very ministry " has come under attack , " @entity23 said			1
the pope himself referred briefly to the scandal at the end of his regular wednesday audience , his first public remarks on the matter			0
he criticized reports about the affair as " entirely gratuitous " and presenting " a completely unrealistic image of the @entity1			1
" but experts say that exactly the opposite may be the truth , and that the arrest , alongside the firing of the head of the @entity55 a day later , may reveal the battle going on behind the scenes at the @entity1			1
the two events are bad pr for the top hierarchy of the @entity12 , but they may be more than that , experts say			2
they could affect who becomes the next pope			0
the effect of each one is the same : to weaken the authority of pope @entity21 's second in command			1
cardinal @entity71 , the @entity1 secretary of state , is involved in a power struggle with his predecessor , experts say			1
" the reason for this fight is that the secretary of state will have a strong influence over the next conclave which will choose the next pope , " said @entity74 , a journalist at the @entity76 daily @entity75			0
the late @entity83 's secretary of state , cardinal @entity82 , is trying to sideline @entity71 and put one of his own proeteges in place before @entity21 dies , @entity74 said			1
" the leaks will end when @entity71 is out as secretary of state , " he predicted			0
he said he expects that @entity71 , who will be 78 in december , would be replaced at the end of the year , but not by the cardinal @entity82 wants			0
@entity82 , who is now the dean of the @entity90 , is n't the only one who does n't like @entity71 , said the rev. @entity92 , author of " inside the @entity1			1
" when he became @entity1 secretary of state , @entity71 " did what normally happens			2
he brought in his team , the people he likes , the people he trusts , and he put them in key positions in the @entity1 , " @entity92 said			2
" there are people who had hitched their star to the previous secretary of state who thought by now they would become an archbishop or a cardinal , and they did n't , " @entity92 said			0
" these people are unhappy and do n't like @entity71			0
" part of the reason for the butler and bank scandals is that the @entity1 has n't been run well in decades , @entity92 said			1
" clerics do n't go to @entity111			0
he does n't have an mba , " he said			0
and @entity21 is no better , he said			2
" he is a @entity114 professor			0
he 's a person who is into ideas , not a manager , and yet he is running a 1.2 - billion member organization , " @entity92 said			2
there 's a faction within the @entity1 that wants the next pope to be " a better manger who can get the shop in order , " @entity92 said			1
" a lot of people think that would be an @entity76 , of course , " after two popes from outside of @entity76 , @entity83 from @entity125 and @entity21 from @entity114 , he said			2
but the undermining of @entity71 may work against that faction , he said			0
" @entity71 is from the @entity1 and is @entity76 , " @entity92 pointed out			2
" people may say we need somebody from outside who can come in and knock heads together and make it work			0
" @entity92 is n't taking a position on where the next pope should be from , but he has strong views on what @entity21 's successor should do : " the place really needs to be restructured and reorganized			1
it still operates in many ways like a 19th century @entity145 court			0
" @entity0 's @entity146 and journalist @entity147 contributed to this report .			0

the leak of private papers is " immoral " and " despicable , " a top archbishop says
factions inside the @entity1 are *jockeying* over who will be the next pope , observers say
the pope 's butler has been arrested and the head of his bank has been fired
the scandals both undermine @entity21 's second - in - command , experts say
