editor 's note : former @entity3 president @entity2 is founder of @entity4 , a not - for - profit organization that seeks to " prevent and resolve conflicts , enhance freedom and democracy , and improve health			1
" read more on human rights defenders : @entity10 @entity2 says closing @entity11 and ending torture would send a strong message			1
@entity14 , @entity15 ( @entity16 ) -- it has been heartening to witness the outpouring of worldwide enthusiasm over the election of @entity21 as the next president of the @entity3 , a transformational moment for our country			1
our incoming president has huge challenges ahead of him , and he will undoubtedly reach out to other world leaders to help address the most difficult problems			0
a high priority will be the restoration of human rights , which have been badly eroded in recent years			1
president - elect @entity21 has reiterated his decision to close @entity11 detention center and end @entity3 - sponsored torture			1
also under discussion is the establishment by the @entity3 government of an independent commission to examine the actions that led to these shameful policies and practices			0
together , these steps would signal a renewed commitment to the cause of universal human rights long championed by the @entity3			1
as this year marks the 60th anniversary of the @entity49 , the reassertion of these fundamental rights is necessary			0
while the @entity3 government has much work to do in this regard , there will have to be a concerted international effort to achieve meaningful protection of human rights , even as the issue of security continues to demand our attention			1
the @entity3 people and our courts have rejected the proposition that some people 's rights can be suspended arbitrarily ; to do so violates the very core of our democracy			1
hopefully , those working to establish democratic practices and institutions worldwide will seize upon this development and convince their own fellow citizens that democracy and human rights are worth the struggle			2
the international community , including a newly energized @entity3 , should move swiftly and decisively to support the local heroes who risk much to advance this cause			2
human rights defenders from throughout the world are participating in our annual conference at @entity4 this week to share the challenges they face , and to decide how the international community can best support their efforts			1
for years , these activists have told us that when the @entity3 engaged in torture and indefinite detention , their decades of struggle for rights began to erode			2
dictators who had felt pressure from the @entity3 to improve rights were suddenly off the hook			2
with new leadership in @entity92 , a clear and principled message on the centrality of human rights can help set a new tone			1
too often , the international community has failed to respond to emerging crises , partly because voices of the oppressed are missing in policy discussions			0
had the international community heeded the warning of human rights defenders in the former @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , and the @entity106 , more robust and coordinated diplomacy and even limited intervention may have averted these crises			2
catastrophic conditions exist in @entity106 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and elsewhere and will require unprecedented cooperation to resolve			0
it is time to embrace the idea that when human beings are systematically abused , international peace and security are inherently threatened			0
in such situations , the global community should spare no effort to help societies in distress			0
crises like these can be assuaged before they escalate if there is determined global leadership and cooperation			0
human rights defenders are on the frontlines of this battle , and we must protect them when they face danger because of their work			2
we must do a better job of listening to their diagnoses of issues and be receptive to their proposed solutions			0
and we must strengthen their voices and help to protect them in a collective , undeniable commitment to create the world of peace and freedom that many of us enjoy and we all desire			0
