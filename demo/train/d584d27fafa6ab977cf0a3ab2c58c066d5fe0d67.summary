-- they are global sporting superstars , and they 've got a story to tell			2
from former @entity5 manager @entity4 to @entity7 captain @entity6 it seems everyone is releasing autobiographies in a blaze of promotion and headline grabbing excerpts -- and all in time for @entity14			1
but whether the intention is to set the record straight , settle a few old scores or simply tell it like it is , the majority tend to live and die by their ghost writer			0
trying to capture the authenticity of the subject 's voice and cram the book full of interesting anecdotes can be a daunting task			0
but with the help of one respected author of several big football autobiographies , @entity33 , whose book on former @entity31 captain @entity30 sold a million copies , here are 10 key components to a successful sporting tome			1
story telling perhaps the most obvious commandment for any sporting book is that the subject matter has to be interesting			2
while a big name can usually be guaranteed to bring with them a loyal following who will buy whatever they release , the more casual observer needs a little more persuasion			0
@entity33 's most famous subject was former @entity31 soccer captain @entity30 , who famously battled alcohol addiction throughout the most successful parts of his career			1
another focused on former footballer @entity56 's issues with betting while his most recent , on former @entity58 referee @entity57 dealt with his recovery from cancer			0
" the subject of the book has to be honest about these things , " @entity33 told @entity0			1
" as a writer you have to press ever detail out of them and make sure you draw out the material			0
" capture the voice any book must bring the character to life in their own words -- it is no good having @entity6 hypothesizing over the @entity77 renaissance period			1
but get the @entity7 captain talking about the influence of @entity4 on his career or any of his famous ' hairdryer ' moments and people will be gripped			1
" you have to capture their voice , " @entity33 explains			1
" @entity87 is much more of a skill than is recognized			0
" one good example is the recent autobiography of @entity92 striker @entity91 , entitled ' i am @entity91 ' , that manages to captures his supreme confidence			1
for instance , the @entity95 forward , who continually refers to himself in the third person , notes : " an injured @entity91 is a properly serious thing for any team			1
" mining the seam the odd five minute chat here or there is n't going to cut it -- an author needs to live and breathe his subject for months if not years			2
that dictum is especially crucial if your sporting figure is n't particularly effusive at the outset -- as the relationship between the two grows so does the material			2
" with the @entity30 book ( the process ) took about 18 months , " @entity33 said			1
" do n't forget this was in the days before the @entity117 , which meant research was a lot more time consuming			0
initially we did three months of interviews -- about 40 hours of tape			0
" lessen outside influences obviously , the publisher is king in the process but @entity33 says it is important to keep their influence -- and pressure -- to a minimum			1
" i have never been under pressure from a publisher and i have never extended a deadline , " he said			0
" as a journalist you are used to meeting deadlines and of course you do n't get paid until you deliver the manuscript			0
" i have never been told how to structure a book , though in the editing process they might come back and say we need more of this and we would have a discussion about that			0
" any publicity is good publicity that old adage rings true even more than ever in the instant digital world of today			0
despite huge chunks of @entity4 's books being reproduced -- much to the chagrin of his ghostwriter @entity153 -- it helped get the juicier bits of the text out in front of the public			1
" you get worried they are ignoring the depth of the book , " @entity33 says			1
" such is the difficulty of selling books			2
but any publicity is good publicity			0
" there is n't the bravery or the courage anymore in publishing especially with anything that is n't mainstream			0
" drown out the detractors any autobiography worth its weight is bound to offend someone or other -- the more the better in terms of publicity -- but it is important the author sticks to his guns			2
@entity33 's book on @entity30 contained a plethora of sensational snippets from the footballer '' s life , not all of them savory and saccharine			1
when the proofs were sent to @entity185 -- then former vice-president of @entity30 ' club @entity186 -- he was deeply unhappy says @entity33 and was worried it painted the club in a bad light			1
but after pointing out the consequences to @entity185 of attempting to gag @entity30 , @entity33 saw the @entity193 vice-president 's attitude completely change upon the book 's publication			1
" when the book was released @entity185 came over to me with a smile on his face and said it was flying off the shelves in the club shop			2
" get it serialized any self respecting autobiography must be trailed in a leading national newspaper to ensure maximum coverage ahead of its release			0
not only does this help to prick the nation 's consciousness it can provide some valuable income in a world where the digital market is shredding the publishing industry slowly and steadily			0
serialization deals sometimes outweigh the advance for a book thanks to a lot of big names releasing books than turned out to be big duds			2
" the publishing industry is in a mess in terms of the digital revolution , especially selling books in hard cover and paperback , " @entity33 said			1
" publishers have been burnt by ordinary sports books that were so dull , but that huge sums had been paid for			2
now advances are very poor and you get what you can for serialization rights			0
" press the flesh despite smashing @entity238 sales records by selling 115,547 in its first week of release and making £ 1.4 million ( $ 2.24m ) , @entity4 is still hitting the road for a series of speaking events to promote his autobiography			1
all but one of the six dates dotted around the @entity238 have sold out and cost £ 40 a ticket , which includes a signed copy of the book that is currently retailing at £ 25 ( $ 40 )			0
not only does this help with sales but it also helps to keep @entity4 and his book in the public eye , with many newspapers -- both regional and national -- covering the events			1
embrace the digital revolution these days social media plays a huge role in the promotion of sports books with @entity261 and @entity262 campaigns an integral part of any launch			2
as part of @entity6 's media blitz the public were invited to a ' global book signing ' via the former @entity271 star 's @entity262 page , whch has 30.5 million ' likes			1
fans from across the globe were able to get a personalized digital autograph on e-books from @entity6 , during a session that included a question and answer section			1
" i always like innovative and original ideas , " said @entity6			2
" what has been created is ambitious but it should be a fantastic event			0
" i love the interaction with my fans , but not only will i be able to do this in @entity287 , i will be able to sign for them in locations across the world			0
" be determined an extension of ' drowning out the detractors ' includes a commitment to getting the book out on the streets in the first place			0
when @entity33 and @entity57 lost a publishing deal they determined to print it themselves -- in @entity301			2
there followed three months of under - the - radar work that felt like the plot of a spy novel , " @entity33 said			1
" for guns , read books			0
i was introduced to a middle man who ran the merchandise to printers in @entity301			0
" but the hard work has been worth it with @entity57 's book garnering bags of column inches in the media and plenty of publicity			0
@entity33 is the author of @entity57 's autobiography added time : surviving @entity322 , @entity323 and the @entity58 .			1
