@entity0 , @entity1 -- a young boy dressed in women 's clothing , his face caked in make - up , dances the night away for a crowd of men			1
the bells on his feet chime away , mimicking the entertainment and sexual appeal of female dancers			2
but there is no mistaking his pubescent body and face as he concentrates , focusing on every step in order to please his master and his master 's guests			2
this all played out in a video that @entity2 obtained from a person involved in the parties			2
the boy is but one youth among many throughout the country forced into an age - old underground tradition known as " bacha bazi , " or " boy play , " in which young boys are taken from their families , made to dance and used as sex slaves by powerful men			1
the number of boys involved is unknown -- the practice has been going on for centuries , in a country where such practices are overshadowed by conflict and war			1
" it 's pretty much unappreciated by [ the ] society , unaccepted and illegal , " said @entity46 of the @entity47 , one of the few organizations in the country working to end " bacha bazi			1
" @entity53 scholars have denounced " bacha bazi " as immoral but the practice continues in @entity1 , where the government is in the throes of an increasingly bloody battle with insurgent @entity59 militants and is also working to recover from decades of conflict			1
the abuse stays on the backburner of issues in @entity1			1
people are aware of it , but they do n't really talk about it			2
almost everyone in the country is coping with some level of injustice , and they are just trying to survive			1
it is widely known among the population that , most of the time it is commanders , high - ranking officials and their friends who partake in the abuse of the boys			1
" it continues because of the culture of impunity and lack of legal provision against this practice , " @entity46 explained			0
@entity85 , 19 , and @entity86 , 20 , are two grown dancers who were forced into " bacha bazi " about five years ago			1
@entity85 was 13 when his older neighbor tricked him into coming to his home			1
he was made to watch a sex tape and then raped			1
after the brutal assault , he was taken to another location where he was locked up and used as a sex slave for five months			2
" i got used to him , " @entity85 said , trying to explain why he stayed with his neighbor after the traumatizing experience			2
" he would sometimes take me to parties , and sometimes other places			0
i was with him all the time , " he said			0
in @entity1 society the victims of rape and assault --- both male and female --- are often persecuted and punished rather than the perpetrator			1
the shame forces boys like @entity85 to continue in leading such lifestyles , even when they have the chance to break away			2
@entity86 , @entity85 's friend and dance partner , is now married but he was the " bacha bereesh " -- or " boy without a beard " -- of a powerful warlord who has since left the country			1
he said the only reason he continues to dance is to provide for his younger brothers and sisters			0
" i make them study , dress them , feed them			0
any money i make i spend on my family			0
i do n't want them to be like this , be like me , " he said , brushing his shoulder length hair away from his eyes , framing his thin oval face			0
@entity85 and @entity86 say their families know what is going on now but are powerless to stop it -- in fact they need the money and income they make			0
both @entity86 and @entity85 look and act more like women than men , a trait that can be deadly in @entity1 's male - dominated society			1
even the police ca n't be counted on for protection			0
@entity85 said that he was taken from a party by four police officers one night and almost gang raped at the station before their commander walked in and stopped the assault			2
but then , " he said if i wanted to be set free i should give him my money and my mobile , " @entity85 said			0
" i had no real choice , so i gave him my money and mobile			0
" the boys said they are continuously threatened , beaten and raped by men who attend the parties they dance at ; parties fueled by alcohol and drugs			1
" the nights we go out , we are scared , " said , @entity86 , who is the more talkative of the pair and the one who more resembles a woman			0
" we always think about how we will be able to get out without someone attacking us			0
" despite the dangers , they continue to dance , making $ 30 for the night -- a night that usually ends in assault -- because they say it is the only thing they know and their only way to make money			0
there are no opportunities in @entity1 for people like them			1
and once branded as men who danced as women , there is no turning back			0
" we are not happy with this line of work , " @entity86 said			0
" we say that it would be better if @entity187 could just kill us rather than living like this			0

young boys in @entity1 are used as sex slaves through " bacha bazi " or " boy play "
human *rights* group : *problem* is not appreciated or accepted by society
issue has very little *profile* in a country torn apart by war and conflict
one teen was 13 when his neighbor made him watch a sex tape , then raped him
