-- @entity2 radicals linked to @entity3 have seized the northern half of @entity5 , one of @entity8 's largest nations , and there are widespread concerns that the region could soon become a terrorist haven			1
the militants have been able to capitalize on the instability of the country , which has seen a rebellion and a government coup within the past few months			2
now , about 500,000 @entity5 have fled their homes in fear of the violence and discrimination that come with the radicals ' strict interpretation of sharia law			1
@entity0 's @entity25 has been meeting with rebels and refugees this week and reporting on the growing crisis in @entity5			1
she talked to @entity0 about the security concerns , the desperate humanitarian issue and how the @entity31 might respond			0
@entity0 : why are some referring to @entity5 as " the next @entity32 " ? @entity25 : we 've talked to senior sources in the @entity31 government and local rebels who say @entity3 wants this to be their next haven			1
there is no government in northern @entity5 right now : it is remote and hard to access			1
former intelligence officials tell me this is @entity3 's last chance of a country as their haven , like @entity32 was before this			1
i was told by locals that extremists are giving people satellite phones and saying , " call in when you see @entity52			0
" they 're paying people money in @entity55 to become " informants			0
" one man told me that families he knows were given 10 times the amount of money they would earn from herding ( their normal work ) to join the cause			0
but there are reasons it 's not like @entity32			0
one of them is that the type of @entity2 practiced in northern @entity5 and the areas around northern @entity5 is much more relaxed			1
locals are not receptive to extreme interpretations of @entity2 : for example , the extremists banned music , putting a dj i spoke to out of a job			1
this is a country that is world famous for loving music ! @entity0 : how did we get to this point ? @entity25 : in the northern part of @entity5 , the @entity84 tribe has always wanted independence			1
since @entity5 became independent from @entity88 in 1960 , they 've staged several rebellions			1
but the catalyst for what is happening here now is what happened in @entity93			0
as @entity96 was killed and @entity93 really fell into disarray , his weapons became available			0
the @entity84 -- many of whom fought for @entity96 -- seized the weapons and went and fought against the @entity5 government and declared independence			1
in the southern part of @entity5 , people were really frustrated at the government 's inability to do anything about the rebellion , and they felt the government was corrupt and inept			1
so there was sort of what i understand to be an " accidental " coup			0
some of the commanders went in to complain , and the president left			0
@entity5 ended up without a government			2
then , the @entity2 radicals , who have long sought a bigger presence in that part of @entity8 , came in and fought the @entity84			1
they overpowered them , and the north of @entity5 is now controlled by @entity2			1
there are some @entity84 fighting within northern @entity5 , and i am aware of camps they operate in the country			1
but they tell me they do n't have the weapons that the @entity2 - linked militias have			1
even the prime minister of @entity5 told me that his army has essentially no weapons to fight , and he needs them from the @entity31			2
@entity5 @entity2 destroy tombs in @entity55 @entity0 : who are these radicals , and where did they come from ? @entity25 : people refer to them as @entity3 , but they 're also referred to by the names of their militias , such as @entity144 or @entity145			1
some are religiously motivated , and some are opportunists : they want control and money but are n't driven by religious beliefs			2
we discovered that they 're coming to northern @entity8 from several places : specifically , @entity93 , @entity154 , @entity32			1
and there is one major radical militia ( @entity145 ) that is also @entity84			0
the leader of that group is a @entity5 @entity84 who spent time in @entity160			2
@entity0 : a large majority of @entity5 are @entity162			2
how do they differ with the radicals ? @entity25 : the brand of @entity2 is different , so there 's not a receptiveness to some of the more dramatic and restrictive parts of what the @entity2 radicals want to do : for example , the full covering of the women , and women and men being separated			1
when i called the military leader of the main extremist group linked to @entity3 , the leader would not talk to me because i was a woman			1
there 's no question that the local population does not want this			0
but still , some people buy in and go along with it			0
@entity0 : how serious is the outside threat posed by these extremists ? @entity25 : i asked some @entity84 fighters what these @entity2 say about @entity31			1
they said that the @entity2 tell people that @entity31 are like animals and like dogs			2
some of that is the kind of propaganda that you expect to hear from @entity3 - linked groups at this point			1
and saying these things is very different than saying someone 's going to be planning an attack on the @entity31			0
but their leaders have said their intention would be to use this as a base			0
@entity84 rebels were adamant in telling me that the radicals plan attacks on the @entity31 and @entity213			0
one expert who is concerned about the risk highlighted to me that 10 % of the population of @entity88 has links to northern @entity8			1
the question is , at what point will the extremists be at a level of organization and stability to do this ? @entity0 : how many refugees are there , and how are they faring ? @entity25 : there are about 250,000 of them , according to the @entity229 , and the number is growing			2
those are people who have left the country			0
there is also another 175,000 people internally displaced within @entity5 , according to humanitarian groups			1
it 's a very serious humanitarian problem			0
the @entity237 told me that they only have food for one more month in july			0
we saw people who are hungry			0
and there are diseases as well because of the conditions in the camps			0
what 's it going to be like if the food runs out ? @entity0 : how has the @entity31 responded to this point , and how might they respond in the future ? @entity25 : on the humanitarian side , the @entity31 is the biggest donor to the efforts here			2
the @entity256 headquarters for @entity8 is reportedly based in @entity257 , @entity258 , and @entity31 government sources told me the @entity2 radicals tried and failed to shoot down a @entity31 surveillance drone over @entity5			1
but the president of @entity258 told me that if the @entity31 is operating drones from his country , that 's not in the deal he has with the @entity31 , and he 'd demand a new agreement			0
so the situation is ambiguous			0
and it 's also bad timing politically for president @entity271			0
this week at a fundraiser , @entity271 said he has @entity3 " on the run			2
" that 's been the administration 's message for the past year			0
defense secretary @entity277 has said it ; @entity256 director gen. @entity279 has said it			0
as @entity3 and its offshoots grow in northern @entity5 , that message may sound off			1
and i think it 's important to mention something we experienced : that the " state " borders are meaningless			0
the @entity2 are also spilling over the border into neighboring countries , such as @entity258			2
we went to that border , and the villagers were terrified of the @entity2 , as they found out that one of the leaders was nearby that day			2
this leads to another question that matters to the @entity31 : could these radical groups destabilize other governments in the region ? it remains to be seen .			2

@entity3 - linked militia groups have taken control of northern @entity5 in @entity8
there are fears that the region could soon become a terrorist *hot* spot
@entity5 flee the country because of the @entity2
@entity25 : if the world does n't pay attention now , it could become really terrible
