@entity0 -- after more than two decades behind bars , @entity2 walked out of a @entity5 courthouse thursday afternoon with an apology from a judge and one immediate wish : " get the hell out of here			1
" @entity2 had been convicted of second - degree murder in 1991 for killing a rabbi during a botched diamond heist			1
but two decades later , a onetime witness said he had been coached into identifying @entity2 in a police lineup -- and after an investigation , prosecutors recommended that @entity2 's conviction be tossed out			1
" mr. @entity2 , to say that i 'm sorry for what you have endured would be an understatement and grossly inadequate , but i say it to you anyway , " judge @entity19 said during an emotional hearing that left even the judge wiping her eyes			1
asked what he wanted to do now , @entity2 told reporters at the courthouse , " get the hell out of here			1
" and with that , he walked out with his lawyer , carrying a small mesh bag that held his belongings			0
" right now , i feel like i 'm under water swimming , " he said			0
" hours later , his lawyer told @entity1 that @entity38 intends to file a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city of @entity0 and the @entity41			2
" my client had 23 years taken from him			1
it is a lifetime , it 's a generation , " attorney @entity43 said			2
" and if you look at those before and after pictures , before he went in , and now that he 's out , it 's a different person			0
" for now , @entity2 plans to relax and reconnect with his family , @entity43 said			1
one of his first requests after leaving the courtroom , @entity43 said , was " a juicy chicken parmesan sandwich with a side of fries			0
" ' a number of things ' wrong with the case @entity2 , now 58 , was sentenced to 37 1/2 years to life in prison in the killing of @entity61 , a rabbi in @entity5 's @entity63 community			1
since @entity2 's trial , another man 's widow has identified her now - dead husband as the killer ; a onetime jail inmate has said he made up statements about @entity2 to boost his own fortunes ; and the man who , as a boy , picked him out of a lineup has come forward to say he was coached by a detective			1
prosecutors have determined the evidence underpinning @entity2 's conviction " has been degraded to such an extent " that it would no longer support the verdict , said @entity81 , the deputy district attorney in charge of @entity5 's conviction integrity unit			1
@entity84 , one of the detectives who investigated the case , told @entity1 that @entity2 admitted his involvement in the heist attempt and that he stands by the arrest			1
as for claims that police coached a witness , he said , " no way that happened			1
" but @entity81 said the investigation found " a number of things that were wrong with the case			0
" " it was cumulative , " he said			0
new evidence led prosecutors to believe " that we could no longer be confident " that @entity2 was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt			1
a witness changes his story a key part of the investigation that led to thursday 's ruling started two years ago , when a witness in the case changed his story			1
@entity109 was 13 years old when he identified @entity110 in a lineup			2
in 2011 , he told investigators that he identified @entity110 after being told by a detective to " pick the guy with the big nose			2
" " i was too young back then to realize that this was a setup			1
to me this was just basically , i never saw a lineup before , i was just part of the process , " @entity109 said in an exclusive interview with @entity1 's @entity118 on thursday			0
" i think as years went by ... as more and more i saw on the news , i saw innocent people get set free in various ways			2
i started to think back to the trial i was involved in , and remembered where i was told who to pick out of the lineup			1
" after @entity109 came forward , @entity81 's unit began to dig into @entity2 's case			1
" as he started to investigate , the whole case fell apart , " @entity109 said			0
" so i guess an innocent man was in jail but is now free			0
the sad part is that the killer never met justice			0
" for some , doubts linger @entity139 , a friend of the victim 's , said he had sat through the trial and came away convinced that if @entity2 had not been @entity144 's killer , " he was definitely an accomplice			1
" " now it 's @entity2 's day to suck in some fresh air and enjoy his free life out there , " @entity139 said			1
but he said the decision to release him left him " confused			0
" " is the shooter still out there ? we 're pointing to a dead man to close the case ? that 's asinine , " he said			0
@entity61 died four days after being shot , a victim of the attempted holdup of a diamond courier			0
the courier escaped , but the would - be robber shot @entity61 through the window of his parked car , hauled him out of the vehicle and drove off , according to the @entity5 district attorney 's office			1
@entity2 was arrested six months later , when two men facing trial on their own robbery charges gave his name to police , prosecutors recounted in asking that his conviction be tossed out			1
in an initial lineup , only one witness recognized @entity175 , and that was after a lengthy conversation with a @entity179 interpreter , they noted			2
in the second lineup , three youths identified him and repeated that identification in court			0
one witness who did n't identify him was the courier , the intended target of the holdup			2
attorney : ' there was no physical evidence ' when questioned by detectives , @entity2 initially denied any involvement in the killing			1
then he acknowledged knowing one of the jail inmates who identified him , according to prosecutors			2
he admitted he had been near the scene and knowing his friends had planned a holdup			0
then he admitted he had been involved in planning the diamond heist , acted as the lookout and had seen the other men with the gun			0
" the police had an alleged confession from him , but there was no physical evidence , " @entity202 , the lawyer who represented @entity2 at his trial , told @entity1			1
" the jewelry courier , he testified for the defense , saying that @entity2 was n't the guy			1
" four years after @entity2 's conviction , a woman named @entity213 came forward to say her husband had been the killer			1
@entity216 , who had died in a 1990 car accident , had been possible suspect before : @entity84 had brought the courier to the morgue in hopes that he could identify @entity213 as the gunman , but he could n't			2
@entity202 sought a new trial for his client based on the widow 's testimony , without success			2
then in 2011 , @entity109 came forward			0
" it was on his conscience for all these years , " @entity202 said			2
" he was 13 years old at the time			2
he was just a kid			0
he was just doing what they told him to do			2
" detective : ' i never framed anyone ' as @entity81 began to dig into the case , details unraveled			0
one of the two jail inmates who put the finger on @entity2 had since died ; the second told prosecutors he had fabricated earlier statements he made about @entity110 , hoping that his cooperation would help his own criminal case			1
his girlfriend at the time confessed that her account was manufactured as well			0
and @entity213 reiterated her previous testimony			0
@entity84 said the case against @entity2 was " very simple , " and he sharply disputes @entity109 's account of being coached			1
" they 're saying that i framed it , " @entity84 said			0
" i want to go on record saying this : i never framed anyone in my life , and you would have to be a low , low devil to do something like that			0
i slept very good for the last 22 years			2
" but @entity43 , @entity2 's attorney , called the case " a travesty of justice from the beginning			1
" " the detective work that was done on this case was at best shoddy and at worst criminal			0
and i do n't use that word lightly , " he told @entity1			0
" but when a closer examination is done of the detective work ... it becomes clear that there were so many leads that were n't followed , there were so many notes that were n't taken and just a general lack of attention to an investigation that required nothing but close scrutiny of the scene , of witnesses and so forth			0
" @entity285 woman 's murder conviction , death sentence overturned @entity1 's @entity286 reported from @entity0			0
@entity1 's @entity287 and @entity288 reported from @entity289			0
@entity1 's @entity290 , @entity291 and @entity292 contributed to this report .			0
