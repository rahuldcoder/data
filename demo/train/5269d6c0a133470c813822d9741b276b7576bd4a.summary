it 's not hard to get into @entity2			1
the problem , one prominent activist tells @entity0 , is getting out			1
@entity6 's voice is calm and measured as he describes life inside the city @entity9 claims as the capital of its so - called caliphate			1
but the horrors he details are harrowing			2
forced blood donations and marriages to @entity9 fighters			1
@entity19 is n't his real name			2
it 's the identity the former medical student who helped found an activist group called " @entity2 is being slaughtered silently " uses to speak out			1
@entity9 fighters have already tortured and executed one member of the group , he says , and they 've made it clear they want the others involved dead			2
still , @entity6 tells @entity0 's @entity28 that wo n't stop him from sharing what he sees			1
" i lost my life ... i do n't have school			0
i do n't have a future			0
i do n't have anything , but i did n't want that for me or for my city , " he says			1
" it 's the situation forcing me to do this			1
i do n't want to be famous			0
i do n't want everybody to know who i am or what i 'm doing			0
it 's just for my city and for my family and for the innocent civilians			1
... we are trying our best			0
we are trying to save our city			1
" here 's a look at some of the things @entity6 has told @entity0 he and others from the activist group have seen in @entity2			1
@entity0 has n't independently confirmed his claims , but his account provides a rare glimpse into the dramatic transformation of a city once known as one of @entity58 's most liberal			1
in two months at least 40 people have been executed in @entity2 , @entity6 says , for charges including being a fighter for the @entity62 , being gay or killing others			0
activists , he says , are also targeted			0
" if you are an activist ... inside the city of @entity2 , it will take you to death , " he says			1
in @entity2 , @entity6 says , a day might start out with a trip to court over a home robbery , and end up with a forced blood donation			1
" if you have anything in the @entity76 court , they say , ' go to the hospital and donate your blood and bring me the receipt , and if you do n't have it , i ca n't help you , " he says			1
" they say to you , ' we ca n't help you until you go to the hospital			0
there ( are ) a lot of airstrikes , a lot of injured @entity9 fighters			0
' " for women , @entity6 says , the city is " like a big prison			2
" they are not allowed to leave the city if they are younger than 45 years old			2
and he says his activist group has documented more than 270 cases of girls forced to marry @entity9 fighters			1
" @entity9 fighters are really sex - mad			0
... some of them have two and three wives , and even with that they are trying to find slaves from @entity103 girls , " he says			0
an effort to repaint buildings in bright colors is n't what you 'd expect to see in a square known as the site of executions , beheadings and crucifixions			0
but @entity6 says that 's just what happened in @entity2 several weeks ago			2
the change is particularly notable , he says , because when @entity9 first came to the city they painted buildings black			2
now , @entity6 says the fresh coats of pink , white , gold and green paint could be a sign that @entity9 is trying to make buildings less of a target for coalition airstrikes			0
" there is a big wall between the civilians and foreign fighters			0
it 's like two different lives inside the city of @entity2 , " @entity6 says			1
" yes it 's heaven for some of these foreign fighters , because they give them a lot of money			2
they give them the fancy houses			0
they give them the fancy cars			0
" but for some , it 's not the paradise they imagined , @entity6 says			2
rumors swirl , he says , about foreign fighters being killed after trying to defect			0
" @entity9 takes their passports and if anyone tries defection from this , they will kill them immediately , " he says			0
" the problem , it 's not how to go inside the city of @entity2			1
the problem is how to get out			0
