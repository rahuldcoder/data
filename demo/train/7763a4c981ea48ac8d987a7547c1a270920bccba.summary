-- @entity2 cricket is embroiled in a new controversy after the national team were accused of deliberately losing two games at the @entity6 by a government official			1
@entity9 's future as @entity2 captain is in doubt following accusations of match - fixing			1
the chairman of the @entity16 's standing committee on sports claimed in a television interview that @entity2 lost to @entity19 to knock traditional rivals @entity21 out of the limited - overs tournament in @entity23			1
@entity19 won by two wickets by running a bye on the final ball of the closing @entity28 tie on september 30 , which ensured they reached the semifinals and ended @entity21 's hopes			1
captain @entity9 then dropped a simple catch as his side lost to @entity35 by five wickets in saturday 's semifinal			2
" we went with a pre-determined mind to lose the match against @entity19 , " @entity38 told @entity2 tv channel @entity39 on tuesday			1
" our intention was to keep @entity21 out			2
it was a deliberate decision to lose the match against @entity21			2
" @entity38 said that the team also intentionally lost the match to @entity35 , who were beaten in monday 's final by defending champions @entity19			1
" that 's why the @entity51 on @entity52 has called in captain @entity9 , coach @entity53 and [ @entity54 ] chairman @entity55 for investigations , " he said			0
one report in @entity2 claimed that @entity9 and @entity53 had already been sacked by the @entity54 , but others said that @entity2 cricket 's ruling body was happy with the team 's performance			1
" the team played well and tried hard			0
it is unfortunate they could n't qualify for the final , which every player wanted to do , but they had one bad day against @entity35 , " @entity54 spokesman @entity64 told the @entity66 web site			0
" as far as we are concerned , the team did well in the @entity6 and their performance was satisfactory			2
" former captain @entity76 criticized @entity38 for making serious allegations without backing them up with proof			0
" i was one of those who first raised the issue of match fixing in international cricket , so i know what i am talking about			0
i can say the team did its best and played hard in the tournament -- a few mistakes cost them a place in the final , " @entity76 told @entity66			0
" i think parliamentarians should first look at the corruption in the government before talking about cricket			0
it is unfortunate that when the team needs backing , a parliamentarian should make such allegations			0
" the accusations are another blow for @entity2 's cricketing fortunes			1
the sub-continent nation lost the rights to host the @entity6 due to security issues -- it was postponed last year and switched to @entity23 -- and was then ruled out of staging the @entity106			2
earlier this year , veteran fast bowler @entity107 missed the @entity108 after needing treatment for genital warts			0
@entity107 , once @entity2 's most feared weapon , has constantly clashed with the @entity54 , which banned him for hitting a teammate with a bat in 2007 and threatened him with court action following a public feud which ended with a five - year suspension that he successfully appealed			1
the @entity54 also punished him for testing positive for the performance - enhancing drug nandrolone in 2006 , while fellow fast bowler @entity119 was arrested in @entity120 for possession of illegal drugs last year .			0
