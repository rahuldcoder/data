-- as a reporter , i spent much of 1998 following a @entity4 candidate who was a handsome , likeable , well - spoken , ambitious guy in his 40s who was a graduate of @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , his hometown			1
at heart , he loved issues and advocacy			0
he was the son of a small - town lawyer and his rise to political heights included surprising turns that led some to speculate he could go on to be president			0
his name was @entity18 , and he won his second term in the @entity4 that year by defeating another @entity7 political wonk in his 40s , @entity22 , a @entity23 who gave up his seat in the @entity26 to enter the race			1
he was , without question , a @entity8 liberal			1
' gen xer ' @entity30 takes up @entity23 torch , makes case to young voters wednesday night , i listened to the acceptance speech of the @entity23 candidate for vice president given by a handsome , likeable , well - spoken , ambitious guy in his 40s who was a graduate of @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , his hometown			1
he is the son of a small - town lawyer , he loves issues and advocacy , and his rise to political heights has included surprising turns leading to speculation he could go on to be president			1
he was , without question , a @entity8 conservative			2
his name , of course , is @entity30			2
( if i was really prescient , i would have been following @entity30 , then 28 , in 1998			2
he seized upon @entity22 's decision to run for @entity4 as his chance to run for the @entity26			0
he has held that seat since , and he has ridden his talents to national influence			0
) as i watched @entity30 on tuesday night , i found myself with two questions on my mind : what is it with guys in their 40s from @entity7 ? more importantly , with so many similar traits and so many parallels in their personal stories , what do @entity30 , @entity18 , and their sharply differing views tell us about politics in my now - so - heavily - spotlighted home state of @entity8 -- and what does that say to the nation ? three thoughts : first , @entity7 is a pleasant , smaller city about 35 miles south of @entity76 with a strong history of taking its politics very seriously but keeping things civil			1
it is rightfully proud of its current prominence			0
it is a place where people such as @entity30 and @entity18 are raised to have a commitment to the public good and to involvement in issues			1
i wish there were more such places and more such people			0
@entity93 , image and substance			0
the pleasant personalities of both @entity18 and @entity30 have been big assets in their political careers			1
we live in a marketing world , and you have to be a marketable person to be a successful candidate			0
both @entity30 and @entity18 fit the bill			1
opinion : how did @entity30 do ? but ultimately , each is known for the serious stuff			2
each is a person of political substance			0
i 'd like to think that ideas and principles still matter and both of these @entity7 guys have shown that it does			1
@entity116 , for decades , have respected that			0
@entity18 received scorn when he was the lone member of the @entity4 to vote against the @entity119 in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks , but it played pretty well in @entity8			1
@entity30 has made his mark as the ideas guy for @entity23 in @entity124 , the guy who has been more than willing to take on issues such as @entity126 and the federal debt			1
we need to have adult conversations about these issues , as he sometimes puts it			0
that has played fairly well in @entity8 also			2
if many national political commentators have said that the addition of @entity30 to the @entity23 ticket means this will be an election in which heavy - duty policy issues get more debate , i think that , too , will look good in the eyes of many @entity116 , whatever their own partisanship			1
what 's bad if the debate is about serious issues and not the trivial things that take up so much attention in major campaigns ? third , what does this have to do with who is going to win ? @entity30 is just about the hottest act in @entity151 politics			1
@entity18 is watching from the sidelines after losing a bid for a fourth term in the @entity4 in 2010 to a previously little known businessman , @entity156 , whose stands are much in line with @entity30 's			1
this has been a good period to be a @entity8 conservative			2
@entity162 was elected governor in 2010 at the same time @entity156 beat @entity18			2
@entity162 set off a huge political fracas with his budget - cutting , union - crushing stands in 2011 , which led to a recall election three months ago that @entity162 won			0
in addition to @entity30 and @entity162 , there is @entity170 , national @entity23 chair ( he 's from @entity171 , in @entity30 's congressional district ) , which gives @entity8 three of the most spotlighted names in conservative politics			1
but the pendulum swings in politics			0
one side , one set of ideas , is impressively dominant at some point			0
then in the battle of ideas and real politics it finds itself on the outs			2
it has happened often in @entity8 , a fertile place for producing political winners who seem to be polar opposites			1
i assume the pendulum will swing some day			0
more immediately , the conservative ( and @entity30 ) ascension does n't mean @entity8 will go for @entity196 and @entity30 in november			1
@entity8 has built a rich record of being almost evenly split when it comes to presidential races			2
the 2000 and 2004 outcomes in the state were very close , with democrats @entity202 and @entity203 narrowly prevailing			0
@entity204 won the 10 electoral votes easily in 2008 , but that seemed to be an exception			0
in the most extensive polling project in @entity8 , the @entity209 , @entity204 has been ahead all year			2
but the race has narrowed			0
with the addition of @entity30 , the gap narrowed to three points ( 49 % to 46 % ) in results released aug. 22 , down from a five - point margin in early august			2
this is , once again , a battleground state			0
the @entity209 poll found ratings on @entity30 in his home state ( 41 % favorable , 34 % unfavorable ) that were better than in comparable national polling , and better than the figures for @entity23 presidential candidate @entity196 in @entity8			1
but it does n't look like @entity30 alone is enough to swing the outcome			2
what will swing @entity8 -- and perhaps the nation ? convincing people who are part of the very small bloc of undecided voters			0
motivating people in each of the parties ' bases			0
@entity30 's speech gives undecided voters mild nudge toward @entity196 that could take the form of basic partisan battling			1
but i would suggest that the lesson of these two major political figures from @entity7 is that sometimes , ideas still matter and serious argument can still be persuasive			1
you can build careers on ideas and advocacy			0
you can win or lose on those things -- which is what is likely to happen in @entity8 and which is , i still believe , the way the @entity151 political system is supposed to work			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity255 .			0

@entity30 and @entity18 are two policy wonks who grew up in @entity7 , @entity8
@entity255 says the two have very different political views but share key *attributes*
he says they , along with many in @entity8 , want politics to be about big ideas and issues
@entity255 : @entity30 may not bring @entity196 to *victory* in @entity8 , but the race has *tightened*
