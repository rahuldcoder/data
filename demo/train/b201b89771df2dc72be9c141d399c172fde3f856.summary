president @entity7 , 85 , has been in office since 2000			2

throngs took to the streets in the @entity22 nation this week to protest the friday ruling , with protesters clashing with police in the capital tuesday			1

one protester died and dozens were injured , state media reported			1
angry mobs burned tires and hurled stones at the police , who responded with tear gas and advanced in armored vehicles			0
footage on local news stations showed a man run over by an armored car as he tried to run away from the police			0
