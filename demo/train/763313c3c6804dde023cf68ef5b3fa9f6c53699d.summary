@entity1 's decision to curtail remote working among its employees has stirred dismay in the technology industry at a time when many companies are innovating new solutions to enable telecommuting			1
at the @entity10 in @entity11 , one of the planet 's biggest showcases of new digital technology , numerous manufacturers are touting gadgets and software specifically aimed at keeping workers out of the office and either on the road or at home			1
yet among those exhibiting at the annual event , there was mixed reaction as some digital innovators aired reservations about @entity1 ceo @entity29 's latest attempt to revive the search engine 's flagging fortunes while others backed a more balanced approach			1
tell us : what smartphone feature would you like to see in the future ? @entity39 's strategy was revealed after a leaked memo set a june deadline for remote workers to either relocate within physical commuting reach of a @entity1 office or leave the company			1
@entity1 has declined to comment but the memo , obtained by tech blog @entity46 , said the move was necessary as " to become the absolute best place to work , communication and collaboration will be important , so we need to be working side - by - side			2
" the announcement comes as many governments worldwide are urging employers to consider telecommuting as way of alleviating overburdened and environmentally detrimental transport systems and also striking better work / life balances			2
advances in technology , particularly the spread of broadband internet connections and 3g and @entity65 mobile phone networks has made this possible			0
at the @entity10 event , many exhibitors stake their futures on an increase in telecommuting			2
@entity72 , senior product manager for @entity73 , said remote working provided a tremendous opportunity for workers to get more out of their lives while reducing their impact on the planet 's ecosystem			1
" we have to be vigilant in making sure that technology does n't let work overtake us			0
but one of things that 's been enabled by this , is the ability to have it all , " he told @entity85 , illustrating his point with an anecdote about being called by @entity89 ceo @entity88			0
" i was at my daughter 's soccer game not long ago and i was waiting for a very important e-mail from a very important person at @entity89 -- named @entity88 -- and i did n't have to stay home and wait for it			2
" i could go to my daughter 's soccer game and see on my phone that the e-mail came in			0
so it was a win - win situation and that 's what technology can do for us			2
" @entity107 was probably fine with that - he probably did n't even know that i was at my daughter 's soccer game			2
" one @entity10 exhibitor @entity110 , a @entity112 - based company that provides technology which can be used to create remote working environments , said @entity1 's move was understandable , but the problems it faces could be overcome with better technology			1
" there is some validity to the arguments motivating @entity1 's move away from supporting remote workers , " said @entity110 chief executive @entity118			1
" worker productivity is in some ways a measure of meaningful human interaction and face - to - face communications			1
" but , he said , communication systems , including video conferencing and internet collaboration , that allow employees to realistically simulate face - to - face interaction , are already on the market			1
" with little effort most remote employees can take advantage of intelligent communications tools to elegantly blend the benefits of being part of a vibrant office environment and having the flexibility that comes from working outside the office on a permanent or part - time basis			1
" @entity145 , another @entity10 exhibitor whose products are directly aimed at creating remote working environments , insisted its technology was capable of recreating every aspect of real - life interaction short of physical contact			1
@entity153 , @entity145 's global communications director , said @entity1 's announcement was unfortunately timed as it came just days ahead of the march 4 start of the third annual @entity157 , a @entity145 - backed global initiative to encourage remote working			1
@entity153 said @entity145 's video - link products allowed employees to talk lag - free in high definition , but he said there was a need to strike a balance between " appropriate " home working and office - based interaction in genuinely collaborative work spaces such as @entity145 's main campus in @entity171 , @entity172			1
" when people come into the office you do n't want people just sitting there heads down knocking out their emails , because they can do that from a caf√© or a home office or remote office			2
" foursquare co-founder @entity182 also emphasized the need for balance : " it is great to offer employees the flexibility that if they need to be off for a day or so , or for an afternoon , that 's totally fine			0
" we try to get as many people together in the office as possible because that 's where stuff gets done			0
people hang out in the lunch room , and they hang out in the hallways and in different meeting rooms			0
you are more productive when people are all together , but i think you need to have a little bit of flexibility			0
" we use things like @entity199 to do a lot of video conferencing at @entity202 , so we 're able to make it work			0
" it 's a mixture of both , but not too much out of the office , " he added			0
@entity208 , president of @entity209 , said : " this is not a black and white answer			0
generally if teams are together they 're definitely more efficient and more productive			0
but that being said , you also need to cater to moms who need to go and pick up their kids from school			0
and so you need to find the right balance			0

exhibitors at annual @entity10 say @entity1 's ban on remote working ignores need for balance
@entity72 of @entity73 says telecommuting improves home life and benefits environment
@entity145 's @entity153 says *modern* technology can now recreate face - to - face encounters
