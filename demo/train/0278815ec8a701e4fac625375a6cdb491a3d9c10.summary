@entity0 has been defined as the wealthiest terrorist group on record , using a combination of black market oil sales , extortion and sophisticated social media to raise money to fund its expansion into @entity9 and @entity10 , according to the @entity11			1
a policy to combat @entity0 on many fronts is taking shape , but western diplomats here in the @entity16 say trying to get coalition members on the same page is proving difficult			2
the harsh reality remains that despite an ever - increasing focus on @entity0 , the group is still pulling in about $ 1 million a day , according to the @entity11			1
a dozen coalition countries led by general @entity23 -- @entity25 envoy in the fight against @entity0 -- met in @entity27 on monday with a two pronged strategy : to decide what are the best tools to choke off @entity0 financing and to win the hearts and minds of the @entity35 world in terms of messaging			1
another part of this effort is getting coalition members to agree on the final goal			0
some big regional @entity43 powers , specifically @entity44 and @entity45 , are still eager to purse a broader coalition campaign which includes taking down @entity10 president @entity47			2
this remains a stumbling block on the path to an effective coalition			0
but there are indications that a more defined strategy against @entity0 has emerged over the past week			2
in his address to the @entity57 , the lead official on @entity0 financing said progress had been made before going on to name those countries which are lagging behind			1

however , @entity64 went onto to say both @entity76 and @entity27 remain " permissive jurisdictions for terrorist financing			1
" that is a strong statement considering @entity27 has set up a financial intelligence unit and @entity76 passed a law regulating fundraising by charities within the tiny but wealthy @entity86 state with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world			1
pressure on @entity76 is coming from both sides of the @entity92			2
@entity93 , the @entity94 's shadow foreign secretary , said the visit of @entity76 's young emir to @entity97 this week is the ideal opportunity to apply more pressure			0
@entity100 is scheduled to meet with @entity102 prime minister @entity101 later this week to define the efforts put forth to undermine @entity0			0
the ability for the prime minister to lean on @entity76 is complicated by the @entity86 state 's spending spree in @entity97 as owner of @entity108 , the @entity110 building and a slew of other prime assets			0
meanwhile , as i reported at the beginning of september , @entity0 's oil production and distribution network is not what it was just a few months ago , when up to 70,000 barrels of crude was finding its way onto the black market			2
@entity64 from the @entity11 suggests -- using his revenue number of a million dollars -- that production has been reduced to 25,000 barrels and that the @entity47 regime is still on the receiving end of that @entity0 - controlled oil			1
now the coalition wants both the @entity129 ( @entity129 ) and @entity45 to close off routes used to distribute that oil			0
both have reportedly made pledges to do so			0
over the past week @entity25 airstrikes are supporting an @entity9 military effort on the ground to finally secure the @entity137 refinery north of @entity138			0
the effort to pull 60 countries of a coalition together , diplomats tell me , is as complicated as the region itself -- especially with so many countries vying for the upper hand .			0

@entity0 , which controls parts of @entity9 and @entity10 , is pulling in $ 1 million a day , says the @entity11
12 coalition countries are meeting in @entity27 to come up with a plan to choke off @entity0 financing
oil sales , extortion and social media are three main ways @entity0 raises funds
@entity11 says @entity76 and @entity27 remain " permissive jurisdictions for terrorist financing "
