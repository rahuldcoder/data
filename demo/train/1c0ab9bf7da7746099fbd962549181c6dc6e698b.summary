-- @entity1 paused saturday on his first morning of freedom in 18 years to share a revelation he gleaned in prison while serving a life sentence			1
the " @entity1 " member recalled telling inmates he had figured out the secret of life			1
" what is it ? " they asked			0
" i said , ' enjoy it			2
enjoy it , ' " @entity1 told @entity16 affiliate @entity15			1
and enjoy it he did friday and saturday			2
@entity1 , @entity1 and @entity18 -- freed friday in @entity19 after a complicated plea arrangement -- spent time with family , friends and supporters			1
@entity24 and @entity1 saw the sunset friday from the rooftop of the @entity27 in @entity28 , across the @entity29 from @entity28 , @entity19			1
supporters @entity30 of @entity31 and @entity32 of the @entity33 joined the party			2
the three men , who served 18 years in prison following their convictions in a 1993 triple - slaying in @entity28 , walked free friday to cheers from a supportive crowd after entering rarely used pleas in which they maintained their innocence but acknowledged that prosecutors have evidence to convict them			1
they had been imprisoned for the slayings of second - graders @entity46 , @entity1 and @entity48			1
the boys ' bodies were mutilated and left in a ditch , hogtied with their own shoelaces			0
prosecutors argued that the defendants , teenagers at the time , were driven by satanic ritual and that @entity24 , sentenced to death , had been the ringleader			0
@entity1 and @entity18 received life sentences			1
attorney @entity60 , who represented @entity24 , said his newly freed client and @entity1 were fascinated by new foods , cell phones and other technology friday			1
" it was if you could see two little 5 - year - old kids at their first @entity69 , " @entity65 told @entity71 ' " @entity70 " saturday			2
" the idea you could take pictures with an @entity74 totally blew them away			0
" @entity18 spent friday night with his family near @entity28			1
@entity0 affiliate @entity77 said @entity24 , who met his wife while serving time , and @entity1 left saturday for undisclosed locations to enjoy seclusion			1
@entity24 and @entity1 entered what is known as an @entity83 plea on three counts of first - degree murder			1
@entity18 entered similar pleas to one count of first - degree murder and two counts of second - degree murder			1
@entity92 circuit judge @entity91 sentenced the three to the 18 years already served and imposed a 10 - year suspended sentence -- meaning they could be returned to jail if they violate the law			2
" i do n't think that it will make the pain go away to the victims ' families			0
i do n't think it will make the pain go away to the defendant families , " @entity91 said , adding it was nevertheless the best for all involved			0
critics of the case against the men argued that no direct evidence tied the three to the murders and that a knife recovered from a lake near the home of one of the men could not have caused the boys ' wounds			2
more recent dna testing also demonstrated no links , according to the men 's supporters			0

" it is a torturous environment that no human being should have to endure , and it needed to end			0
i am innocent , as are @entity1 and @entity18 , but i made this decision because i did not want to spend another day of my life behind those bars			1
" while prosecuting attorney @entity138 said the pleas entered friday validate the decision of jurors who sent the men to prison , it also spares @entity19 the possibility of a retrial , which would have been difficult to prosecute after so many years , or a potential civil lawsuit by the men			2
the trio had been on course to win the right to new trials later this year			0
@entity138 said he believes the pleas resolve the case			1
" i have no reason to believe there was anyone else involved in the homicide of these three children but the three defendants who pled guilty today , " he said			0
but he said the state could file charges against others if new evidence emerges implicating someone else in the case			2
@entity1 , whose stepson @entity1 was one of the three victims , said he believes the three men are innocent and releasing them without exonerating them of the crime is an outrage			1
they did not kill my son , " @entity171 said before the hearing			0
the father of another of the victims , @entity46 , also blasted the decision , but for another reason			0
" i do n't know what kind of deal they worked up , " @entity180 told @entity0 affiliate @entity181 before the hearing			0
" now you can get some movie stars and a little bit of money behind you , and you can walk free for killing somebody			1
" @entity1 , who said he prays for the victims ' families , told wmc saturday he hopes to return to school			1
" right now , i am floating on the hands of people who love and care for me , people trying to get my feet under me and everything , " he said			0
" i 'm just trusting @entity197 to take care of me			0
" @entity65 credited new dna evidence , a new hearing and a new judge as instrumental to friday 's proceedings			0
the attorney claims the three freed men and supporters will push to see that the real killer eventually is found			0
" he 's still out there , " @entity65 told @entity71			0
" the right guys have been set free			2
