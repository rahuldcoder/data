-- remember @entity1 , that little video rental outfit that sent you dvds via the @entity6 mail ? the one whose red envelopes would arrive with dulling regularity and sit near your television for months on end as you attempted to catch up on your dvr recordings ? it 's playing with the big boys now			1
@entity1 is , of course , no longer just a dvd rental service			1
it also streams movies and tv series -- including its own			2
on thursday morning , @entity1 received the ultimate recognition			1
one of the company 's original series , " @entity23 , " was nominated for best drama for the @entity25			1
another , " @entity28 , " received a nod for actor @entity27			2
a third , " @entity31 , " got two nominations			2
see the complete list of nominations " @entity23 " is going up against veterans such as " @entity35 , " " @entity36 , " " @entity37 , " " @entity38 " and " @entity39 " for @entity41 's most prestigious award			1
the series earned nine nominations overall , including lead acting nods for @entity45 and @entity46			2
the broadcast networks may want to take notes			0
not a single show on @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 or the @entity54 was nominated for best drama , though network sitcoms such as " @entity57 , " " @entity58 " and the now - defunct " @entity59 " were nominated for best comedy along with @entity62 's " girls " and " @entity63 " and @entity65 's " @entity64			1
" it 's a trend that 's been developing for years , as the broadcast networks have opted for franchising ( " @entity75 , " " csi , " " @entity77 " ) and reboots ( " @entity79 " ) over the complex , often serialized dramas that the cable networks have used to get publicity and establish a foothold in the medium			1
nevertheless , it 's surprising that such hits as " scandal , " " @entity83 , " " @entity84 " and " @entity85 " failed to earn enough support to nudge their way into the category			2
original programming was a major gamble for @entity1 , which had noticed how people had started " binge - watching " shows such as " @entity35 " -- watching entire seasons of popular series in one or two gulps			1
the service invested $ 100 million in " @entity23 , " based on a @entity97 series from the 1990s			1
the bet paid off with increased subscriptions and a huge amount of media coverage -- coverage that was multiplied when @entity1 decided to put " @entity28 " back into production			1
despite its cult following and major critical success , " development " had been canceled after just three seasons on @entity53 in the early 2000s			0
( creator @entity109 had famously begged tv audiences to watch his low - rated show after it won a best comedy @entity41 in 2004			1
) @entity113 , @entity1 's chief content officer said , " we are overwhelmed with 14 nominations and honored by a warm welcome which corroborates what we have always believed , that great television is great television regardless of where , when and how it is enjoyed			1
" of course , " @entity28 " supporters can argue the show still gets no respect			0
the show did n't get a nomination for best comedy , though star @entity27 did get a nod for best actor in a comedy			0
the show got three nominations overall			0
" @entity132 : asylum , " the follow - up to the well - received " @entity132 , " led all programming with 17 nominations , followed by @entity62 's " @entity38 " with 16 and " @entity136 " with 15			1
( the @entity62 movie " @entity139 " also got 15 nominations			0
) perennial @entity41 leaders " @entity35 " and " @entity36 " also did well , nabbing 13 and 12 nominations , respectively			1
" @entity143 " was nominated for best reality competition show for the 11th consecutive year			0
the show has won the category every year except 2010 , when " top chef " -- also up in the category -- won			0
" @entity139 " earned nominations for best tv movie or miniseries			0
both lead actors , @entity152 and @entity153 , earned nominations for their performances as @entity156 and @entity156 's partner , @entity158			2
@entity62 's " @entity165 " did well , with nominations for stars @entity160 , @entity162 and the film itself			2
" @entity37 , " @entity171 ' juggernaut about an early 20th - century group of fraying @entity97 aristocrats , earned 12 nominations , including lead actor recognition for @entity168 and @entity169			0
" @entity175 with @entity176 " and " @entity177 " are up for outstanding variety series			0
" honored to be nominated for an emmy this morning , " said @entity178 , who scored a nod for his " @entity180 with @entity178			0
" " takes the sting away from being snubbed by the @entity184 last night			0
" there were a handful of surprises			0
@entity188 picked up a best actress - drama nomination for " @entity190 , " the @entity192 series based on characters from " @entity194			0
" @entity195 -- now 91 and more popular than ever -- received a nomination for hosting her comedy - reality show , " @entity195 's off their rockers			2
" " @entity36 's " @entity200 was nominated for both that show and the miniseries " @entity203			1
" and " @entity204 -- rising quickly on the chatter of her much - talked - about series -- received a best actress - drama nomination			0
@entity62 led all networks with a whopping 108 nominations			0
@entity52 and @entity51 tied for second ; both got 53			0
and @entity1 , though down the list , got 14			1
with the service rolling out more series -- " @entity216 " just got started , and another season of " @entity23 " is on the way -- expect many more in the future			1
