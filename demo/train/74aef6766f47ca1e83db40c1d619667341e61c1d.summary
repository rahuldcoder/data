-- once " the @entity2 , " @entity1 now calls himself " the @entity3 " -- but his much - hyped first press conference back at @entity5 revealed that his new character may well be " the @entity7			1
" nine years and a day after he was first unveiled at the @entity9 club as the brightest coaching talent in world football , @entity1 returned to @entity12 after what he described as the worst season of his career in @entity16 with @entity17			1
he has signed a four - year contract , but has never lasted that long at any club he has managed despite winning multiple national titles and two @entity22 crowns			1
now i am prepared for that because , to be fair , before i was n't , " the 50 - year - old told some 250 gathered reporters monday when asked if he was ready to stay for a long period			0
" i was in a position to say which league i prefer , which one is the club i prefer , which one is the mentality i prefer			2
" so now it 's up to me to work hard and show my club that i deserve to be here for a long time			1
i have a contract for four years and i hope to go to the last day of that and if the club then wants to keep me , i 'll be happy			1
" although some key players remain at @entity40 from his first reign , @entity5 has experienced a big turnover of staff since @entity1 left " by mutual consent " in 2007 -- having eight different managers in that time			1
three members of the club 's coaching setup then are now managers at @entity9 clubs : @entity51 's @entity50 , @entity53 's @entity52 and @entity55 's @entity54			1
" i found a much better club in different areas , but there is stability needed in football terms , " @entity1 said			1
he insisted he did not fall out with @entity5 's billionaire @entity62 owner @entity61 when he departed six years ago , and that they still have a good relationship			1
" i read and i keep hearing that i was fired , i was sacked , we had a complete breakdown of our relationship -- that was not true , " he said			0
" many did n't believe that but it was a mutual agreement			0
we thought it was best for both of us , for me and the club			0
" only because there was never a breakdown of the relationship is it possible for me to be here today			0
i think i 'm back because we are in the best moments of our careers and ready to work together again			0
" there are much better conditions at this time to succeed and have what we want , stability			1
" after leaving @entity5 , @entity1 won two @entity87 @entity86 titles and the @entity88 with @entity89 , which he described monday as " probably the best moment of my career			1
" he refused to dwell on the controversies of his three years at @entity17 , where he broke @entity94 's dominance by winning the @entity96 title in 2011 - 12 with a record points and goal tally but failed to win over the local media after dropping @entity101 - winning goalkeeper @entity100			2
" it was a football decision , i decided for one player and not the other and it is up to the player to accept it or not , " @entity1 said			2
" all my decisions are based on meritocracy , then i can sleep well			0
" @entity1 was called the " scourge of @entity16 football " by @entity94 's vice-president and was also criticized by players such as @entity111 , having controversially poked his finger in the eye of coach @entity114 and presided during some ugly , ill - tempered matches between the two teams			1
" i ' damaged ' @entity16 football by being the manager who broke @entity94 dominance , " he said			0
" it looked like a dominance without an end but @entity17 won the cup final against @entity94 , won the @entity125 against @entity94 , won in @entity94 and won the championship			0
" @entity17 could not win a 10th @entity22 title , though @entity1 guided " @entity17 " to three successive @entity88 semifinals after several seasons of waiting to reach even the last eight			1
he said @entity5 would not be fixated on winning the @entity88 , having already done so for the first time last year			1
" @entity5 focus on every competition -- i ca n't say one is more important than another one			2
in this moment the @entity88 ca n't be an obsession for me			2
it 's not an obsession for @entity5			2
it 's a consequence of our work			0
" @entity1 refused to criticize @entity5 's outgoing manager @entity141 for his decision to sparingly use the club 's longtime captain @entity143 last season			1
" i wo n't speak one word about @entity141 's decisions , either on @entity143 or any other player , all i can speak about is the future and the future is to meet @entity143 on july 1 and try to get the best out of him , " said the @entity146 , who had a prickly relationship with the @entity149 when he was at @entity55			1
" i know what he can give , so let 's try to make him again the best player he can be			0
" just as @entity100 was not guaranteed a place in his team , @entity1 said veteran stars such as @entity143 and @entity164 could expect no favors			2
" it is important for me to tell you that there is no privilege for them			0
they know that already as they know my nature as a manger			0
" @entity1 had been linked with the managerial jobs at @entity176 and @entity177 , but @entity178 has replaced @entity179 at @entity180 and @entity181 is expected to take over from @entity182			2
" i am where i want to be			0
i would n't change it for anything , " he said			0
" i am the happy one			0
a lot of things happened in my professional life in the last nine years , but i have the same nature , i am the same person , i have the same heart , i have the same kind of emotions related to my passion for football and my job , but i am a different person in this moment			0
" if i have to describe myself , i would describe myself as a very happy person because it 's the first time i arrive in a club where i already love the club			2
