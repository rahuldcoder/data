-- a federal appeals court in @entity2 , @entity3 , has blocked same - sex marriages in that state from resuming immediately , until the three - judge panel hears broader questions over the constitutionality of such marriages			1
the brief order from the 9th @entity11 late monday set aside a federal judge 's decision earlier this month that would have permitted same - sex marriages to resume in @entity3 as early as wednesday			1
that came after the judge ruled a voter - approved ban on same - sex marriage violated federal civil rights laws			1
the appeals court also set a fast schedule to hear the merits of the constitutional challenge to @entity23 , the 2008 initiative defining marriage as only between one man and one woman			1
oral arguments will now be held the week of december 6 , meaning a decision on whether same - sex couples can legally wed likely will not be decided until sometime next year			1
opponents of @entity23 seeking to overturn the voter - approved ban on same - sex marriages will not appeal monday 's ruling to the @entity35 @entity34 , according to spokesman @entity36 with the @entity37			1
opponents could ask the @entity34 to intervene on the narrow question of whether to allow the stay to be lifted , but both sides of the debate agree the odds of the justices getting involved at this stage are very slim			0
the case has had an up - and - down series of rulings and referendums			0
the state 's high court had allowed same - sex marriage , but then the voter referendum two years ago passed with 52 percent of the vote			2
the @entity3 @entity34 subsequently allowed that initiative to stand , saying it represented the will of the people			0
opponents of the law next filed a federal challenge , saying the law violated 14th @entity63 constitutional protections of due process and equal protection			0
judge @entity66 on august 4 agreed , issuing a 136 - page opinion that concluded , " @entity23 fails to advance any rational basis in singling out gay men and lesbians for denial of a marriage license			1
" the @entity74 - appointed judge added , " @entity23 does nothing more than enshrine in the @entity76 the notion that opposite - sex couples are superior to same - sex couples			2
" same sex marriage is currently legal in five states and in the @entity81 , while civil unions are permitted in @entity83			0
the five states are @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , and @entity88			0
@entity66 's landmark ruling assured a swift federal appeal that ultimately may reach the @entity34			2
one sticking point could be whether @entity23 supporters in court -- all private citizens and groups -- have legal " standing " to continue appealing the case			2
state officials , including the governor and attorney general , support individual same - sex couples challenging the law			0
such state " actors " traditionally defend voter referendums and legislation			0
some legal experts say if the appeals court eventually rules @entity23 backers can not bring their petition for relief , the @entity34 may not seek to intervene further , giving no clear guidance on the larger question of the constitutionality of same - sex marriage nationwide			1
the high court , in a 1997 unrelated appeal , had expressed " grave doubts " about the ability of such private groups to challenge rulings that strike down ballot initiatives			0
@entity66 's ruling had given the losing side a chance to appeal , and he held off allowing same - sex marriages from resuming until an emergency injunction request could be decided by the higher court			1
among the federal appeals judges who agreed monday to block same - sex marriages from resuming immediately was @entity129 , a @entity130 native who was interviewed this spring by president @entity131 for the @entity34 vacancy that eventually went to @entity133			2
the case is @entity135 ( 10 - 16696 ) .			0

@entity3 's @entity23 defines marriage as only between one man and one woman
on august 4 , a federal judge ruled that prop 8 violates federal civil rights laws
monday 's appeals court ruling sets aside that ruling *pending* further hearings
arguments will now be held before the appeals court in early december
