-- with all of the recent deadly storms in the news , it may seem has though this year as been more active than a normal year			1
since september 1 we have seen eight tropical cyclones , five of which became typhoons , two reaching @entity10 status , the strongest classification of tropical cyclones in the @entity13			1
a @entity15 scientist points to a screen monitoring @entity17 and @entity18			0
but when we look at the numbers , 2009 has actually been slightly below average			2
so far we have seen 19 tropical storms in the @entity13 , which is slightly behind the pace needed to reach the yearly average of 27			1
named storms , however , are a notoriously poor metric for measuring the ferocity of tropical seasons			2
take this year in the @entity27 for instance			0
yesterday , @entity29 became the eighth named storm , coming only a week after the @entity31 would normally name the eighth storm on an average year			2
so while 2009 may contain an average number of storms , no one will argue that 2009 has so far been a dud of a hurricane season in the @entity27			1
this is largely due to the fact a majority of the storms so far this season have been weak , short - lived , and not made landfall ( @entity44 did not even last one day )			0
a better way to measure hurricane and typhoon seasons is with @entity47 ( @entity47 ) , a surprisingly simple mathematic calculation			0
the @entity49 , a @entity50 scientific agency that studies oceans and the atmosphere , uses @entity47 to approximate the energy contained in each cyclone			0
@entity47 is continuously monitored all around the globe by @entity56 , a doctoral student at @entity57 , and according to @entity56 's numbers the @entity13 is 20 percent below average for the season			1
for comparison , the @entity27 is 50 percent below average for the year			0
go here to see @entity56 's research despite the fact that 2009 has been below average for the season , the past month has been remarkable , with five of the eight storms making direct landfall in @entity69			1
@entity18 made landfall in central @entity71 early thursday			0
in the @entity15 , people are still recovering after two typhoons hit the nation in less than two weeks			2
@entity17 made landfall last weekend , killing at least 16			0
@entity15 were still recovering from @entity75 , which hit the country in late september			0
hundreds of people were killed from that storm , primarily in the @entity15 and @entity79			0
earlier in the summer , more than 600 people died in @entity81 after @entity82 struck in august			0
also in august , @entity83 killed more than a dozen in @entity81 after it brought flash floods and landslides			0
what is behind this recent uptick in activity and why are all the storms seemingly coming at once , and late in the season ? the answer may be @entity94 , which refers to a periodic change in the atmosphere and ocean in the @entity13			1
during @entity94 , the waters in the central and eastern @entity13 are warmer than normal , and the effects on global weather can be drastic and far - reaching			1
according to @entity56 , we see more cyclones later in the season during @entity94 years in the @entity13 , and they tend to form farther east			1
with the warmer sea surface temperatures during an @entity94 event , this would allow these storms more time over open water to grow into large and powerful typhoons			1
in fact , we tend to see more " @entity113 " during @entity94 years , and this is true again this year , as @entity114 and @entity18 both reached @entity10 status			2
@entity94 also is a likely culprit for the inactivity in the @entity27 , since @entity94 can cause more wind shear in the upper atmosphere , a condition that limits the ability of @entity122 to survive .			1

spate of deadly storms have hit @entity69 in recent weeks
statistics show number of storms in @entity13 in 2009 is below average
