the afeared nasty weather did n't show up for the @entity1 on sunday			1
but @entity4 , with its hundreds of millions of dollars worth of commercials , was there			0
and it looks like the ad men and women have caught on to this whole social media thing			0
for the first time , more than half of all commercials aired during the big game included a social hashtag			1
from @entity17 's @entity16 to @entity19 's # @entity18 , 57 % of the ads featured hashtags , those searchable terms that have spread from @entity22 to @entity23 , @entity24 and other platforms			1
that 's up from 50 % last year and 7 % the year before -- a remarkable ascent , considering that @entity28 made news just three years ago when it became the first @entity1 advertiser to push to @entity22			1
despite @entity22 's buzz factor , 1.2 billion - user - strong @entity24 may still be @entity4 's platform of choice			1
@entity24 got five specific mentions in ads , compared to @entity22 's four			1
" several large trends are converging to fuel this phenomenon , " wrote @entity36 for @entity37			0
" @entity41 's power is waning , making must - see tv that consumers choose to watch live ... more valuable to advertisers than ever before			0
but as the price tags for these live tv spots rise , brands want something more than 30 seconds of tv exposure for their $ 4 million			0
they are finding that extra value on social media			0
" there was plenty of action for them to court			0
@entity22 reported that a record 24.9 million tweets about the game were sent during the telecast			1
that topped the 24.1 million from last year 's game			2
and while that increase can be attributed , at least in part , to the growth of social media use as a whole , it further establishes @entity22 as a @entity1 party within a party , where people expect to share , and be entertained , during big live events			1
the biggest @entity22 moment came when @entity74 's @entity73 ran a kickoff back 87 yards to open the second half and , essentially , seal the @entity3 ' fate			2
that generated a whopping 381,605 tweets per minute			2
that was much higher than @entity22 's peak during last year 's @entity1 , which reached 231,500 tweets per minute during the @entity84 blackout of the third quarter			1
" not only do consumers watch the game and the ads on their televisions , but they keep their devices at the ready to engage with that content , " said @entity86 , of social - marketing firm @entity87			1
cars led the way , according to @entity87			0
@entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 saw the biggest increases in the amount of social engagement after their commercials aired , according to the company 's analysis			0
@entity106 also generated lots of social chatter with an ad featuring citizens singing " @entity114 " in a range of languages , from @entity113 to @entity115 to @entity116			2
some took to @entity22 to complain that the song should be sung in @entity113 , which prompted others to defend the ad and cry racism			2
even folks who did n't fork over the millions of bucks needed to get airtime during the game were doing their best to get noticed			0
@entity125 made a splash with tweets like this : " @entity129 ! ! is sseattle going toa runaway wit h this ? ? ? " users and some media outlets speculated aloud that a tipsy or illiterate employee had commandeered the @entity125 account before the retailer revealed that it was all a promotion for mittens			0
and , believe it or not , there were even some social media moments from the game that did n't involve anyone trying to make money			2
from @entity148 @entity147 's throwback fur coat to @entity150 's swipe at @entity151 , social media followed , and amplified , every moment ( that @entity150 post had been retweeted more than 55,000 times by midday monday )			0
on monday morning , 9 of the 10 top - trending terms on @entity24 were @entity1 - related , from @entity157 's interview with president @entity158 before the game to the touching text received by @entity3 player @entity161 from his son after the game .			1

more than half of @entity1 ads included social hashtags
more ads featured @entity24 mentions than @entity22
the game generated nearly 25 million tweets , more than last year
experts say *mobile* - ready viewers expect to be social
