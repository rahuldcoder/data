each letter had a @entity105 , postmark and no return address			0
@entity18 , a self - styled activist known as @entity18 , has used similar signoffs on letters and social media posts , his attorney said			0

@entity18 acknowledged that he posted a fake certificate , but said he did it to catch @entity15 stalking him online			2

in 2007 , @entity15 failed in his bid as a @entity165 to defeat democratic state representative @entity166 , whose mother , a judge , received one of the ricin - tainted letters			1
