-- climbing the world 's highest mountain is challenge enough , but for @entity4 , it also meant breaking a taboo			1
the 27 - year - old graphic designer is from @entity7 , an ultra-orthodox country which only officially allowed sport to be played in private girls ' schools in may			1
but @entity4 , who had been raised by her parents to aim for greatness , wanted to test her limits and that also meant challenging her culture			2
@entity16 seemed like the perfect pursuit but getting her father , who still maintained conservative views , to agree was going to be the first hurdle			1
" i told him the idea and he was like ' you want to do what ? ah very interesting			0
why do n't you leave it until you get married ? ' " @entity4 recalls			2
fuming and determined not to give up on her dream , @entity4 then wrote her father a long email arguing her point and then waited for three agonizing days for his response			2
" i was so scared of his reaction , " she says			0
" and after the three days of silence to me he sent me one line -- ' i love you			0
' " since then , @entity4 's family has supported her every step of the way			1
she began climbing in november 2011 and in the space of a year , conquered eight mountains including @entity40			0
@entity41 , by the numbers then on may 18 this year , she stepped into the history books by becoming the first @entity7 woman to climb to the summit of @entity41			1
she was also the youngest @entity7 to reach the top of the world and was part of the first @entity50 team to make the climb			1
" when i finally got there i was thinking 75 % of people die on the way down , so i was thinking celebrate but not too much because you still have to get down			0
" @entity4 had trained hard for the expedition and promised herself that if she was at risk of losing fingers and toes to frostbite , she would abandon her attempt			2
many doubted she would make it			0
" one person actually said ' what is @entity65 doing on the mountain ? ' and i said : ' do n't let the @entity69 princess hair fool you			0
' " @entity4 's triumph on @entity41 is the latest in a growing number of milestones for women in @entity7			1
she follows the path of @entity77 - based @entity76 who became the first @entity7 woman to compete in an @entity80 at the @entity81 last year and @entity83 - born @entity82 who became the first @entity50 woman to reach the @entity85 in 2010			1
" i did not set out to be a poster child for anything , " @entity86 she says			0
" i saw a mountain			0
i wanted to climb it			0
" @entity4 's only hope is that her achievements will help change the perception that @entity7 women have of themselves and cites an email she received from a young fan			1
" i think she was 13 or 14 years old ... saying ' i just wanted to tell you that after hearing your story i found the courage to ask my father for a bicycle			2
' i thought if that young lady had the courage to buy a bicycle today and to ride it , what is she capable of tomorrow ? " for @entity4 , the achievement is not being the first @entity7 woman to conquer @entity41 , but to ensure she is not the last .			1
