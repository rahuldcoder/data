-- let 's understand what all the fuss is about with the @entity6 administration 's ill - conceived " @entity8 " operation -- or rather what it should be about			1
it 's not about assigning blame , or playing " gotcha , " or covering up mistakes			2
it 's not about @entity15 critics forcing top administration officials to resign , or those officials spinning whatever fantastic narratives are necessary to avoid doing so			2
it 's about who pays the price when government agencies make bad decisions			2
when field agents from the @entity26 deliberately allowed some 2,000 guns to " walk " into @entity29 from gun shops in @entity31 as part of a harebrained and hazardous scheme to track @entity29 drug cartels , and then lost track of the cargo , they set in motion a deadly series of events			1
before long , guns from the operation were showing up at crime scenes on both sides of the border			1
when one government agency screws up , other agencies sometimes pay the price			0
one of the weapons even showed up at the murder scene of @entity50 border patrol agent @entity8			1
but by far , the group that paid the heaviest price for this doomed initiative is the @entity29 people			1
there is no way to know how many @entity29 died at the hands of criminals armed with weapons supplied courtesy of the @entity26 , but @entity61 , an @entity26 agent at the @entity62 in @entity63 , reportedly testified to congressional investigators that @entity8 guns showed up at nearly 200 crime scenes			1
this scandal is about dead @entity29			1
as politicians in @entity69 have been known to ask : where 's the outrage ? there is n't much of it , and what little there is seems to be reserved for political adversaries			2
republicans , led by rep. @entity78 , chairman of the @entity79 , have expressed outrage that the administration spent months stonewalling an investigation into the program by refusing to honor requests for information			1
more recently , they 're questioning whether attorney general @entity86 might have committed perjury when -- after being asked by the committee in may 2011 when he had learned of the operation -- he responded : " i 'm not sure of the exact date , but i probably heard about @entity8 for the first time over the last few weeks			1
" @entity93 e-mails obtained by @entity95 reporter @entity94 -- who months ago was the first reporter to break this story on a major network with the help of @entity26 whistle - blowers -- suggest otherwise			1
the e-mails show that @entity86 was given regular briefings on the program as far back as july 2010			0
that would appear to contradict his testimony to @entity105			0
when @entity94 asked @entity109 officials about the apparent contradiction , their initial response was to claim that the e-mails in question were about a different operation that started before @entity86 took office			2
then they shifted gears and claimed that @entity86 misunderstood the question			0
he did know about @entity8 , they said , just not the details			1
more recently , the administration has shifted gears once again and apparently decided that the best defense is a good offense			0
not surprisingly , @entity94 is now intensely unpopular with both the @entity109 and @entity123			0
the reporter told radio talk - show host @entity125 that -- as she worked the story -- a woman from the @entity109 ( whom she identified as @entity130 ) " was just yelling at me " and that someone from the @entity123 ( whom she identified as @entity133 ) " screamed at me and cussed at me			0
" last week , @entity86 went on the attack			0
he lashed out at @entity78 and other @entity15 critics of his handling of the operation , charging them with using " irresponsible and inflammatory rhetoric			1
" and he urged people in both parties to repudiate such language " in the strongest possible terms			0
" @entity86 also insisted : " my testimony was truthful and accurate			0
... i have no recollection of knowing about @entity8 or of hearing its name prior to the public controversy about it			1
prior to early 2011 , i certainly never knew about the tactics employed in the operation			2
" at this rate , who knows what the attorney general 's next strategy will be ? we 're going to find out			1
@entity78 has subpoenaed @entity86 to appear before his committee again			2
we need to get to the bottom of this scandal , and if the administration is n't cooperating , there is all the more reason to keep digging			0
that also goes for @entity94 and @entity166 , who have done first - rate work			0
frankly , i am surprised by @entity86 's use of words such as " irresponsible " and " inflammatory			0
" what could be more irresponsible than allowing weapons to be smuggled into a foreign country , weapons that then wind up killing the citizens of that country ? and what could be more inflammatory than appearing to cover up such an operation and distancing oneself from it as staffers allegedly yell , scream and curse at reporters who are just doing their jobs ? and what was the purpose of these alleged theatrics ? was all this huffing and puffing intended to get @entity94 to back off the story ? brilliant			0
as a former reporter , let me give the administration a tip : attacking journalists is usually as effective in stamping out a story as gasoline is in putting out a fire			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201			2

@entity201 : dead @entity29 are real scandal in @entity8 gun operation
he says @entity26 let guns " walk " into @entity29 to track cartels and they turned up at crime scenes
he says attorney general seems to be skirting responsibility for *misbegotten* scheme
@entity201 : rep. @entity78 right to investigate what 's an *injustice* to @entity29 *victims*
