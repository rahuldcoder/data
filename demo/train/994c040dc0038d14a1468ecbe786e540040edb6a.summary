@entity0 , owner of the @entity2 cafe , knew something was n't right when @entity4 and @entity4 sat quietly in a back corner booth that august night in 2011			1
gone was the usual boisterous banter typical of their regular visits			2
@entity0 says things became even more tense when a bald , blue - eyed man twice their age arrived			0
the three talked for about an hour			0
" he sounded different and he acted different , the guy with them , and they all were , like , nervous , " @entity0 said			0
" and that time , ( @entity17 ) was really serious and he was n't himself			0
" the man , who @entity0 had never seen before and has n't seen since , had a thick @entity20 accent			0
three weeks later , on september 11 , mess , 25 ; @entity4 , 31 , and another friend , @entity4 , 37 , were found dead in their second - floor @entity22 apartment			1
their throats had been slashed ear - to - ear , marijuana was sprinkled across the corpses , and several thousand dollars in cash was found at the scene			2
a neighbor says @entity4 ' girlfriend discovered the bodies and came to his house			0
her feet were bloody , and she was crying			0
she calmly asked for a cigarette and called police			0
then - district attorney @entity39 said days after the crime that the victims and two unknown perpetrators appeared to have known each other and that it was not a random crime			0
no suspects were named , no arrests were made			0
the case got no attention in the national media at the time			0
but nearly two years later , when @entity4 ' friend @entity52 was named as a suspect in the @entity55 bombings , authorities began to take a closer look at the unsolved murders			1
@entity59 cover of bombing suspect called ' slap ' to @entity20 murders assumed to be drug crimes the victims were fun - loving guys , by their friends ' accounts			2
@entity4 had a business making high - end glass bongs and was planning to move to @entity69 once his drug charges in @entity71 were resolved			0
his lawyer , @entity72 , says his client was close to a plea deal when he was killed , but declined to say more , citing attorney - client privilege			2
@entity4 , @entity4 and @entity4 were " always together , " said @entity0 , but he did n't know how the three came to know each other			0
mess ' picture still hangs on the restaurant wall			0
a dish called the @entity81 was named in his honor			0
nearly two years later , many who knew the victims are puzzled by the fact that they were n't questioned by detectives investigating the killings			2
they 're also wondering why police did n't question @entity52			1
mess and @entity52 were high school friends and sparring partners at @entity93 's @entity92 gym in the @entity20 neighborhood of @entity95			1
but @entity93 said when he talked to @entity52 several days after @entity4 ' killing , his friend showed no signs of grief			1
" he kind of laughed it off , saying , you know , that @entity4 probably got what he deserved ... making bad choices , that those were the repercussions he had to face , " @entity93 said			0
video shows @entity20 bombing suspects at gym days before attack though only @entity4 had faced a drug charge , @entity93 said the assumption was that the murders were connected to drugs			0
" around here , we call it ' @entity115 ' -- no humans involved , " @entity93 said			0
meaning , he explained , that " there were three drug dealers murdered over drugs and money , which seems apparent because that was what was left over the bodies			2
" but @entity124 , a friend of @entity4 and a writer for the pro-marijuana magazine @entity126 , said the theory of a drug robbery makes little sense when no drugs or money appear to have been taken from the apartment where the men were killed			1
" anyone who knew @entity4 would know that he was in no way some kind of dangerous drug dealer , " @entity124 said			2
" he was a college - age kid who loved weed			0
i think that the police writing it off early on possibly may be the reason they did n't investigate further , which could have prevented the @entity20 bombings			2
" deadly connection ? the killings -- on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks -- occurred as @entity52 , who came from a family of @entity149 refugees , was becoming an increasingly devout muslim			2
@entity93 said @entity52 and another gym member , @entity151 , used to pray together in the gym			1
@entity93 said he was never questioned by police after the gruesome murders of the three friends			2
neither was @entity0 , who says he had a father / son relationship with @entity4 and who knew @entity52 as well			1
four months after the murders , @entity52 left @entity20 and traveled to the @entity161 republic of @entity162 , where his parents lived			1
sources have told @entity165 they believe @entity52 became radicalized on that trip , and some law enforcement sources have questioned whether the marathon bombings would have happened had @entity52 been questioned in the @entity22 killings			1
authorities accuse @entity52 , 26 , and his younger brother , @entity171 , 19 , of planting the bombs that exploded april 15 at the finish line of the @entity55			1
three people were killed there and more than 260 wounded			1
while @entity52 was killed a few days later as he and his brother engaged in a firefight with police , @entity171 was captured			1
he was arraigned last week on charges of killing four people -- including an @entity182 police officer who was shot as the brothers fled -- and wounding hundreds more in the bombings and the pursuit			2
@entity186 : fast facts in the ensuing investigation of the marathon bombings , authorities also questioned @entity151 , who had moved to @entity191			1
while being questioned in his home may 22 by an @entity194 agent and @entity71 state police officers , @entity151 admitted he played a direct role in the @entity22 killings and implicated @entity52 as well , a federal law enforcement source told @entity165 at the time			1
@entity151 told investigators the men were killed during a drug ripoff because he and @entity52 were afraid they would be able to identify them and tell police what happened , according to a law enforcement source			1
a @entity208 government official briefed on the investigation said that while being questioned , @entity210 suddenly knocked over a table , brandished " a long - handled object " and lunged at the @entity194 agent , who shot and killed him			1
the shooting remains under investigation			0
group seeks probe into death of man who knew @entity20 bombings suspect @entity223 district attorney @entity222 said after @entity151 's death that the @entity22 killings remain an " open and active " case , and that police and prosecutors " have conducted a thorough , far - reaching investigation			1
" " this investigation has not concluded and is by no means closed , " @entity222 said			0
now some of those who knew @entity4 , @entity233 and @entity4 are questioning whether @entity52 should have been under scrutiny long before the marathon attack			1
looking back at the young man 's attitude following the @entity22 murders , @entity93 wonders whether a big clue was missed			1
" retrospectively , maybe there was something behind that , " he said .			0
