@entity0 -- it 's wednesday afternoon , and it 's packed in one of @entity0 's three huge @entity4			1
the branch in the imposing @entity6 in the heart of the city 's business district is humming with customers			1
there are people at every station , clicking and swiping			0
and there 's a long , roped - off queue that stretches the length of the store			1
a smiling , blue - shirted employee tells me they 're the lucky ones who made it into the quota for an @entity23 that day			2
@entity4 enforces strict limits on the number of phones sold each day , and the application process opens at 8 each morning			1
it fills up " really fast , " he says			0
and if you keep missing your chance ? if you 're prepared to throw down a huge markup , you can just walk out the door			0
outside both the @entity6 and the other @entity36 location , there are legions of @entity23 " flippers , " lined up and brazenly selling their wares for 20 % to 30 % more than the official retail price			1
two - phone limit while the quota enforces a two - phone limit per customer , resellers use proxies -- sometimes domestic helpers or laborers -- to buy up the phones for a small fee , meaning there are plenty of " gray - market " iphones for those willing to pay a premium			1
they sit on cheap plastic chairs with their open suitcases beside them , stacked up with white boxes			0
most of them have handwritten cardboard signs with the phones they have available			0
the prices , though , are nowhere to be seen ; they 'll tap it into a calculator when you ask how much the phones are going for that particular day			0
i ask one couple sitting next to a stack of about 10 phones , about 50 meters away from the @entity6 store , how much a @entity74 gold @entity73 is			0
hk $ 9,600 ( $ 1,238 ) , he tells me			0
inside the store , if you 're lucky enough to make the quota , the same phone would be a shade over hk $ 8,000 ( $ 1,032 )			0
i ask him where he got it , and he points with his thumb over his shoulder at the giant @entity4 logo			1
the @entity4 employee tells me that it 's a risk to buy a phone from a reseller ; if it was n't originally purchased in the city , it wo n't be covered for warranty here			1
but despite the warning , it seems that most of the flippers ' inventory is sourced just meters away			0
back outside , the reseller 's own phone rings : a beat - up white @entity23 or @entity97 , covered by a yellowing case			1
he answers it , clearly not convinced of a sale , so i turn to his partner and ask whether i can get a discount			2
she jabs a new price into a calculator : hk $ 9,580 , a saving of just $ 20 ( $ 2.50 )			1
watch : people are paying $ 3,000 for this iphone it 's not like i do n't have much choice of dealer			2
there are another five or six guys lounging around nearby , smoking and chatting near their own stacks of brand new , boxed - up phones , but the prices seem to resist too much market fluctuation			1
i ask another the cost of an identical phone ; he quotes me hk $ 10,000 ( $ 1,289 )			0
at the nearest mtr -- @entity0 's subway system -- stop there 's another couple sitting with a @entity127 - style assortment of @entity23 boxes			1
they 're not selling , explains @entity130 , a secretary who 's using her lunch break to do some @entity23 transactions			2
they 're buying , and as we speak , she hands over her old @entity23			0
she gets hk $ 1,100 ( $ 142 ) for it , which she 'll put toward an @entity97 from the @entity4			1
" i do n't care too much about having the latest model , " she says as she heads over to buy it			0
it 's the same scene as the @entity6 location in @entity141 , one of @entity0 's major shopping districts , if not even more blatant			1
@entity4 customers have to pick their way through the 30 or so resellers who are lining the sidewalk directly outside the @entity4 's glass doors			1
legal trade ? the @entity23 flippers have their cardboard signs propped up against suitcases and cardboard boxes , from which @entity23 boxes spill			1
one woman even has a couple of @entity160 boxes mixed in there			0
what they 're doing is n't illegal , a nearby police officer tells me			0
it 's just consumer - to - consumer aftermarket sales			2
" just like if i was to sell something to you , " he adds			2
and @entity4 's own security , who patrol the street in black polo shirts , ca n't do anything about the flagrant reselling right outside their store			1
" they 're on public property , " the officer says			0
" so they ca n't get them to move			0
" the suspicion is that a lot of these phones end up on the other side of the border , in mainland @entity184 , brought across either by tourists or by the resellers			2
while iphones have legitimately been on sale there since october 17 , demand continues to outstrip supply , justifying the additional 20 % to 30 % markup			1
as always in this city , money is talking			2
and increasingly , it is an affluent class of @entity184 citizen who is willing to pay over the odds			0
locals are being forced out of the property market , education costs -- as well as competition for school places -- are on the up , and people say that despite stagnation of wages , daily costs continue to rise			0
so for @entity4 and cashed - up mainlanders , it 's a win - win			1
those left in the cold are the @entity0 citizens who want to get their hands on a new phone the legitimate way			2
with the quota system swamped each day from 8 a.m. sharp , it might be a long wait for that new 6 @entity225 .			0

iphones sell for significant markups in @entity0
much of the trade takes place right outside the city 's @entity4
" gray market " after - sale market is legal but allows resellers to tack on 20 % to 30 % to retail price
