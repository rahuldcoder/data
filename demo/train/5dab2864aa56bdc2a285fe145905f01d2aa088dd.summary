-- fifty years ago , @entity3 's animated moose and squirrel duo , " @entity4 , " debuted on @entity5 , forever changing the way the world looked at animated television			1
his daughter , @entity9 , continues her father 's legacy as executive producer of the feature films " @entity16 , " @entity15 " and " @entity14 , " and @entity19 's ( sister channel to @entity0 ) new " @entity14 " animated tv series			1
" my dad was a true eccentric , " @entity3 said			1
" his studio was a wonderland for me			0
it had a soda fountain , ice cream sundaes , a snow cone machine , a popcorn maker and candy bars everywhere			0
" @entity9 grew up in @entity30 , @entity31 , and did n't move to @entity32 until 1959 at age 13 when her dad set up his television studio			1
" @entity38 was always doing fun things , " @entity3 said , recalling a 1961 @entity36 block party her father hosted to promote " @entity4			1
" the show was originally named " @entity4 and his friends , " but was renamed " @entity4 " when the program went from @entity5 to @entity42			1
@entity3 was a one - man public relations machine , churning out first - rate promos in the days before @entity47 companies were entrenched in the system			2
in another promotional stunt , @entity3 tried to buy an island between @entity51 and @entity52 that he named @entity54 ( he leased it instead )			2
in efforts to have @entity54 made into the 51st state , @entity3 traveled cross-country by bus , collecting signatures along the way			2
when @entity3 reached the @entity62 gates , he asked to speak to president @entity63 about statehood for @entity54 , but guards brusquely turned him away			2
as it turned out , @entity63 was dealing with the @entity67 on that exact day			0
@entity3 did not have a favorite character , his daughter said , because to him it would have been like selecting a favorite child ( incidentally , @entity3 had three kids )			1
of all the characters he created , @entity3 did n't have a favorite per se , but @entity9 does recall his partiality to @entity15 , the slow but well - meaning @entity52 mountie			1
when asked about " @entity4 's " everlasting appeal , @entity3 said she thinks it struck such a chord and remains popular today because her father never wrote for children , he wrote for adults			1
@entity3 wanted kids to enjoy the pictures while grown - ups laughed at the quick wit and inside jokes			1
in one episode , @entity4 and @entity86 are propelled to the moon when their oven explodes while the pair are following @entity86 's grandmother 's recipe for mooseberry fudge cake			1
fun for kids for obvious reasons , but adults certainly got a chuckle when the moose griped about still having to make payments on the oven			2
@entity86 also mentions having graduated from @entity102 -- the @entity103 , that is			0
furthermore , mr. @entity104 the dog , a @entity106 graduate , lives in a @entity108 penthouse , practices yoga and has an adopted son , because as he puts it : " every dog should have a boy			0
" @entity104 chooses an orphan because he " always roots for the underboy			0
" it 's these little jokes that set the show apart from typical children 's programming of its time			2
today those jokes may not have us rolling on the floor laughing ( or @entity126 , as the kids say ) , but they were the 1960s equivalent of @entity130 's reaction to being rejected by " @entity131 " on " @entity132			2
" the 50th anniversary of " @entity4 " also means that spy duo @entity4 , mr. @entity134 and the fractured fairytales are celebrating birthdays as well			0
fractured fairytales offered a skewed take on traditional children 's stories			0
the moral was the same , but modern , funny dialogue was tossed in with slapstick humor			0
@entity146 , for example , visits a barber shop and laments about having " no future			0
" " incredible writing is the reason the show resonates to this day , " @entity3 said			1
today , cartoons are more popular than ever			0
there are cable networks devoted to animation , and it is commonplace for cartoons to be written specifically for adults			0
@entity160 's sunday night animation domination block featuring " @entity161 " and " @entity132 " comes to mind			0
" @entity4 " was among the first animated series to hit prime time television			0
@entity165 even paid special homage to @entity3 when he created " @entity161 " by giving @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 the middle initial " j , " as in @entity4 's full name : @entity171			1
@entity9 said she is thrilled there 's such a wide array of animation available to viewers today , especially since in her father 's era it was difficult to even get airtime for the genre			1
new projects are always coming the duo 's way , and an animated @entity185 feature film is in development .			0

50 years ago , @entity3 's " @entity4 " debuted on @entity5
@entity3 's daughter @entity9 continues the legacy with " @entity4 " films
@entity3 's pictures appealed to kids , but show was written with adults in mind
