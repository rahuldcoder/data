@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 feared that it would have been overwhelmed in the event of a @entity6 attack because of the depleted state of its armed forces , according to secret files made public on tuesday			1
@entity13 president @entity12 watches @entity3 pm @entity14 speak at a 1979 meeting in @entity16			1
papers released by the @entity18 , under the 30 - year rule , reveal that @entity21 fighter jets only had sufficient ammunition for two days of combat and the @entity24 would fail to defend the country from @entity27 submarines			1
the army would have been too over-stretched to cope with a widescale campaign of sabotage and subversion by @entity6 special forces , the papers show			2
prime minister @entity14 called the situation a " scandal " when he discovered the scale of the problem and demanded resignations among the military			1
" @entity40 help us if there is a war ! " he scrawled on one note			0
but ministers could do little until the @entity46 fighter plane became available in the mid- 1980s along with other military hardware			0
the problem became clear when senior intelligence officers warned in late 1977 that , in the event of a conventional war , the @entity27 could unleash up to 200 bombers and 18 submarines against the @entity3			2
the assessment of the @entity55 was that @entity3 forces would be unable to cope			0
" @entity3 forces can not match the threat postulated by the @entity63 assessment , " the chiefs noted in january 1978 in a document marked @entity59			0
" air defenses would be outweighed because aircraft would be outnumbered and stocks of air defense munitions would sustain operations for only two or three days			0
" maritime forces need better anti-submarine weapons , and face a massive threat from submarine and air - launched missiles and also from mines ; the most serious deficiency is in numbers			0
" the army in the @entity3 would , until mobilization is complete , have insufficient forces to meet its commitments ; after mobilization of the reserves , a process taking between 15 - 20 days , the @entity81 would be able to counter the currently assessed @entity6 land threat during the initial stages of the war but , lacking supporting arms and logistic support , it would be inadequate to deal with any more significant threat , including sabotage or subversion on a wide scale			1
