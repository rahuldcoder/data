-- the toughest conditions she has ever played in			1
that 's how one of tennis ' biggest stars described this year 's scorched @entity7			1
and it 's not hard to see why			2
with temperatures in excess of 40 degrees , and after four days of players fainting , vomiting and tirelessly icing themselves to keep cool , @entity11 was feeling hot and flustered			2
the fourth seed , a runner - up at last year 's @entity16 grand slam , was facing match point and a shock early exit at the hands of world no. 26 @entity21			1
but the @entity22 sent a backhand five centimeters long of the baseline , letting @entity11 back in to take a second - set tie break and then take advantage of the extreme heat contingency plan			2
in light of the oppressive weather , tournament organizers have allowed for an extra 10 minutes between the second and third sets of women 's matches , a break which rejuvenated the @entity35 champion			2
" after the second set , lucky thing we had the 10 minute break , " @entity36 's @entity11 told reporters after her 1 - 6 7 - 6 ( 7 - 2 ) 6 - 3 victory set up a fourth round match with @entity41 @entity40			1
" i think five centimeters saved my tournament			0
if she hit it in , i think me and my whole team would be on our way to the airport now			0
" at least i won the match , and i 'm still in the tournament now			0
it was a difficult day for me but i was really happy with the way i was fighting on the court from the first point until the last point			0
" while @entity11 went to cool down , tournament doctor @entity63 had defended organizers ' refusal to halt play during the sunniest parts of the day , saying that , while playing in the heat might be terribly uncomfortable , human beings " evolved on the high plains of @entity60 chasing antelope for eight hours under these conditions			1
" there will be some players who complain and no - one is saying it is terribly comfortable to play out there , but , from a medical perspective , we know that man is well adapted to exercising in the heat			0
whether it is humane or not is a whole other issue , " @entity63 told the @entity78			0
words that might not be music to @entity84 's @entity83 's ears , who was treated for heatstroke			0
whatever the conditions , world no. 1 @entity87 continues her peerless dominance of the women 's game			1
the top seed has now won more matches at the @entity7 than any other woman in history after registering her 61st success at @entity97 by beating @entity98 6 - 3 6 - 3			1
" i feel good to have gotten through that one because it was tough conditions out there , but i was happy to win , " said the 32 - year - old			2
" today actually was n't as hot			0
i think it was hotter yesterday			0
so it was n't as bad today			0
honestly , on the one end i felt it was like a cool breeze coming over , so that was a good sign			0
" @entity87 ' fourth round opponent will be the resurgent @entity110 , who reached the fourth round after coming from one set down to end @entity114 @entity113 's hopes of a home grand slam triumph			1
in the men 's draw , defending champion @entity117 remained on course for his fourth @entity7 title in a row as he eased into the fourth round with a 6 - 3 6 - 3 7 - 5 victory over @entity124 of @entity125			1
" i feel better on the court as the tournament is progressing , " @entity117 , who played under the cool conditions of the @entity128 's closed roof , told reporters			1
" of course , i played three matches in different conditions			2
the roof was closed and the temperature dropped by at least 10 degrees , and you could feel that			0
it affected the play , it was much slower			0
" victory for the @entity141 , who won his first grand slam in @entity16 in 2008 , sets up a meeting with his old friend @entity145 , after the @entity147 beat @entity149 @entity148			1
" i 'm going to try to win against him regardless of whether he 's a friend or not , " @entity117 continued			1
" i have a real friendship with him for more than 10 years but once we get on court we 're both professionals and we want to win			0
" @entity157 third seed @entity156 , @entity158 , the @entity22 seventh seed , and @entity161 @entity160 also booked their places in the next round of the sizzling @entity7 .			1
