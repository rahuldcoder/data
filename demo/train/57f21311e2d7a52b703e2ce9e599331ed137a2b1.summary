-- the @entity1 has brought on a former @entity3 attorney to conduct an independent investigation of academic irregularities at the @entity1 campus			1
@entity10 , a 19 - year veteran of the @entity11 , will have access to " new information that may become available , " @entity1 system president @entity7 and @entity1 chancellor @entity9 said in a joint announcement friday			1
the appointment of @entity10 by the university system comes amid increased national scrutiny on the matter			1
the institution has been under the microscope for two years , ever since the revelation that students -- mostly athletes -- were taking classes where little or no work was required			2
renewed scrutiny came this year when @entity0 published findings from whistle - blower @entity27 that showed 8 % of a sample of @entity1 students playing the money - making college sports of football and basketball were reading below a third - grade level			1
the announcement friday said @entity10 will have access to information from local district attorney @entity37			1
the prosecutor has been investigating @entity1 's @entity39 and @entity40 -- the department where fake classes were uncovered			0
late last year , the former head of that department was indicted on fraud charges related to those classes			0
" @entity37 has indicated that he will cooperate with the inquiry and that he can now share with the independent counsel as much information acquired by his office during the criminal investigation as determined to be appropriate , " the joint statement said			1
the prestigious public university has repeatedly attacked the credibility of @entity27 , but has also acknowledged shortcomings in its academics			2
" i think that it is amazing , " @entity27 said when asked about the new outside investigation			0
" ... the truth has been available all this time			0
truth is cheap , compared to whitewash and lies			0
" the @entity1 statement said @entity10 's finding will be made public			1
" based on information that the district attorney is able to offer , @entity10 will take any further steps necessary to address any questions left unanswered during previous reviews commissioned by the university , " the @entity1 press release said			1
" while there is no set timetable for completing the inquiry , the university will cooperate fully with @entity10 and ensure he has the full access he needs to complete his work			1
" @entity1 has done several other internal investigations since @entity76 newspaper first broke the story about the fake classes			0
each time , the findings have raised more questions			0
among them , the question of who came up with the idea for the fake classes , and how so many athletes were directed toward them			0
initially , the university denied that athletics was tied to the scandal , and the @entity90 declined to take any action against the university , saying it was an academic scandal , not an athletic one			2
officials now appear to be backing away from that claim and leaving open the possibility that there was a stronger athletic tie			0
" we have directed mr. @entity10 to ask the tough questions , " @entity9 said			2
" follow the facts wherever they lead , and get the job done			0
