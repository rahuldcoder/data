-- phrases such as " reviews you can trust " and " reviews from real travelers " have misled @entity7 users in the @entity8 , according to a judgment issued wednesday by the @entity10 in @entity8			1
the decision comes in response to a complaint filed by a reputation management firm and two hotels , claiming that some of the claims of trustworthiness and authenticity on the very popular user - generated review site are misleading and ca n't be substantiated , since the site does n't verify reviews			2
" we told @entity7 not to claim or imply that all the reviews that appeared on the website were from real travelers , or were honest , real or trusted , " the @entity10 wrote in its decision			1
the issue is overblown , @entity7 indicates in its response to the ruling , saying the requested changes have already been made to the marketing copy on its website			2
" we have confidence that the 50 million users who come to our site every month trust the reviews they read on @entity7 , which is why they keep coming back to us in increasingly larger numbers to plan and have the perfect trip , " the company said in a statement , noting that the @entity10 's " highly technical view " relates to two marketing phrases used " in limited capacity			1
" the @entity10 's decision affects only @entity7 's operations in the @entity8 , where the company has been under pressure from businesses that say some of the site 's reviews are fake or defamatory			1
@entity53 , co-founder of @entity54 , the reputation management company that filed the complaint , said it receives regular inquiries and complaints from hoteliers who say that false @entity7 reviews are hurting their business			1

" " as with all marketing messaging , the wording used on the @entity7 site is constantly evolving to reflect different aspects of the business , which was the rationale behind a change back in june 2011 to put more focus on the @entity7 community , " the company said			1
while @entity7 does n't claim to be 100 % free of fraud , according to the @entity10 ruling , the company told the @entity10 it uses advanced fraud detection systems and substantial resources to combat fraud			1
