-- a federal appeals court thursday reinstated a key part of a new @entity4 abortion law , considered to be among the most restrictive in the country			1
the decision came three days after a federal judge struck down the provision , which requires doctors to obtain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they 're providing abortion services			1
a day before parts of the law were scheduled to take effect , @entity16 district judge @entity15 on monday issued an injunction blocking the law 's admitting privileges requirement , arguing that it " places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus and is thus an undue burden to her			1
" thursday 's decision means the requirement will remain in place while a lawsuit moves forward			0
the lawsuit -- filed in @entity36 in @entity37 by @entity38 on behalf of more than a dozen women 's health care providers across @entity4 -- alleged the state 's new abortion law violates the constitutional rights of women and puts unreasonable demands on doctors who perform abortions			1
in a statement , @entity38 said the requirement that doctors have admitting privileges is expected to cause at least one - third of the state 's licensed health centers that provide abortion services to stop			1
" while we acknowledge that @entity38 has also made a strong showing that their interests would be harmed by staying the injunction , given the @entity62 's likely success on the merits , this is not enough , standing alone , to outweigh the other factors , " read a part of thursday 's 20 - page ruling by the @entity56			0
the bill originally failed to gain approval because of a @entity68 filibuster led by state sen. @entity69			1
gov. @entity70 then called the @entity71 into a second special session to continue consideration of the bill			2
" this fight is far from over			0
this restriction clearly violates @entity4 women 's constitutional rights by drastically reducing access to safe and legal abortion statewide , " said @entity76 , president of @entity38			2
" if @entity82 showed @entity16 one thing during the historic protests against this law this summer , we demonstrated that @entity82 value women 's health â € ” and that is why we will take every step we can to protect the health of @entity4 women in the wake of this ruling , " she said			2
" today 's decision affirms our right to protect both the unborn and the health of the women of @entity4			0
we will continue doing everything we can to protect a culture of life in our state , " he said in a statement			0
