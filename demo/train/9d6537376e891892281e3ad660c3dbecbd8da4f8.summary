-- the federal government is recommending changing the amount of fluoride in drinking water for the first time in 50 years			1
the @entity6 and @entity7 are proposing the change because of an increase in fluorosis -- a condition that causes spotting and streaking on children 's teeth			1
the government is proposing that the recommended amount of fluoride in drinking water be set at 0.7 milligrams per liter of water			1
the recommended range has been 0.7 to 1.2 milligrams per liter since 1962			0
the @entity7 will determine whether the maximum amount of fluoride allowed in water will also be lowered			2
fluoride was first added to water in the @entity21 in the 1940s to help prevent tooth decay in children 8 years and under			1
" one of water fluoridation 's biggest advantages is that it benefits all residents of a community -- at home , work , school or play , " said @entity6 assistant secretary for health dr. @entity25			2
" and fluoridation 's effectiveness in preventing tooth decay is not limited to children , but extends throughout life , resulting in improved oral health			1
" the @entity41 says dental fluorosis is highest among adolescents between the ages of 12 an 15			0
one reason for the increase in fluorosis : @entity21 now have access to fluoride from a variety of sources , including toothpaste , mouth rinses and prescription supplements , the @entity6 says " dental fluorosis in the @entity21 appears mostly in the very mild form -- as barely visible lacy white markings or spots on the enamel , " the department said in a statement friday			1
" the severe form of dental fluorosis , with staining and pitting on the tooth surface , is rare in the @entity21			2
" the change is being made now , according to an administration official , because the current range is out of date			0
he said that in the 1960s , when fluoridating water began , air conditioning was much less common			0
so children in hotter regions drank more water and needed lower levels of fluoride to protect their teeth , while children in colder climates drank less water and needed higher levels			1
" now since air conditioning is so common , " the official said , " you do n't see those differences in consumption , and that 's why they 're getting rid of the range and recommending one level			0
" the @entity92 says the new recommended levels will still reduce tooth decay but minimize fluorosis			1
the group says it continues to support fluoridation of community water as a safe and effective way to prevent tooth decay			2
" this is a superb example of a government agency fulfilling its mission to protect and enhance the health of the @entity21 people , " said @entity92 president dr. @entity101			2
" we have always looked to the federal health agencies to guide us on this and other public health matters , and we will continue to do so			0
we applaud the @entity6 for reaffirming the safety and efficacy of optimal community water fluoridation , with science on their side			0
" the @entity117 , a nonprofit organization whose goal is to protect public health and the environment , says it has been pushing governmental officials to reduce fluroide levels for years			2
" we 've had to wait too long , but the government 's official , belated -- and perhaps begrudging -- announcement marks its recognition that fluoride policies have been out of step with the science on the tap - water additive 's toxicity to children , and that many @entity21 children are at risk from excess fluoride in drinking water and other sources , " said @entity124 , senior vice president for research at the @entity117			1
" since 2005 , @entity117 has been calling on federal agencies to respond to these findings , which come from @entity143 and many others , documenting that excess fluoride exposure poses dangers that range from discolored teeth to potential hormone disruption and neurotoxicity			0
@entity6 has taken an important first step			0
now it 's up to water utilities to respond and for the @entity7 to lower its high , legal limit on fluoride in drinking water , which is more than five times higher than the new maximum recommended amount			1
" the recommendations have been submitted to the @entity160 for a 30 - day public comment period			0
the final version is expected this spring .			0

there has been an increase in a condition called fluorosis
it causes spotting and streaking on children 's teeth
the @entity92 says the new levels will still reduce tooth decay but minimize fluorosis
fluoride was first added to @entity21 drinking water in the 1940s
