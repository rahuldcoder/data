a top - secret @entity1 team uses spyware and hacking to gather intelligence on targets , according to a new report based on internal agency documents			1
according to @entity10 , a @entity11 magazine that published some of the documents , the unit 's interception techniques are worthy of @entity14 : intercepting a computer being shipped to a target and installing spyware before it is delivered ; supplying an altered monitor cable that transmits everything on a computer 's screen to the @entity1 ; or planting a usb plug with a secret radio transmitter			1
the unit , called @entity25 , also uses hacking in addition to spy craft			1
the most basic method involves phishing , sending an e-mail that lures a target into clicking on it and unknowingly downloading @entity1 spyware			2
more sophisticated techniques include identifying exploitable computer vulnerabilities by eavesdropping on a target 's error messages ; tracking a target 's cookies to shadow their internet use ; and even surreptitiously diverting a target 's web surfing to phony replica web pages of commonly used sites such as @entity45 and @entity46			1
agents could use such fake sites both to see what a target is typing and to try to insert spyware on the target 's computer , according to cybersecurity expert @entity54 at @entity55 , a @entity56 - based information technology security company			2
" now they have my username and password , they can get into my account and help them in other attacks , " said @entity57			0
" but in this particular scenario , what they really want to do is infect my machine " by transferring malware to it			0
" from an eavesdropping perspective , this is a gold mine , " he said			0
" if i can ' own ' your computer , if i can gain access to it and gain a foothold into it , now i have access to all of your secrets			0
" an @entity1 spokeswoman declined to discuss specific reports about the unit but said in a statement , " @entity25 ( @entity25 ) is a unique national asset that is on the front lines of enabling @entity1 to defend the nation and its allies			1
" she added that " its work is centered on computer network exploitation in support of foreign intelligence collection			1
" the documents in @entity10 named targets that were penetrated successfully , including @entity97 's security service and an underwater communications cable network			2
in 2010 , @entity25 counted 279 active operations worldwide			2
" this is @entity1 's hacking organization , " said @entity100 , who wrote a book about the @entity1 and said he has spoken to members or former members of the unit			1
" it 's 1,600 men and women , military and civilians , average age mid- 20s , maybe early 30s , so it 's a very young , very tech - savvy organization			0
" the hackers focus on foreign militaries , governments and corporations , he said , and they are protected by multiple levels of secrecy			0
" cypher - locked doors			0
you have to have a special need - to - know clearance for access to the @entity25 spaces at @entity1			1
and the people who work there ca n't talk to any other @entity1 employees about what they do and how they do it			0
" this report follows a string of revelations leaked by former @entity1 contractor @entity133 about privacy and spying , from the tracking of millions of overseas cell phones , to the monitoring of foreign leaders ' phones , to the global bulk scanning of e-mails			1
president @entity144 commissioned a panel to review the @entity1 's tactics , and he is expected to address their findings in january			0
according to the documents posted online by @entity10 , @entity25 programmers develop spyware to infiltrate everything from smartphones and computers to routers , servers , hard drives and firewalls to access global communications traffic			1
but there is no indication that the companies whose products were targeted , such as @entity164 , @entity165 , and @entity166 , cooperated with the @entity1 's spyware or were even aware of it			2
" no commercially available security system can detect a bug implanted by @entity25 , " said aid			0
" that 's its reputation			0
