earlier , the @entity16 said an additional 19 cases were found in the eastern provinces of @entity19 and @entity20 as well as the city of @entity22			0
seventeen people have died from the @entity25 strain of the virus which , while common in birds , had n't been detected in humans before the first cases were reported in march			1
the @entity16 says it 's still exploring the possibility whether the virus can be spread between people			1
" in a significant percentage of cases there is no known contact with poultry			0
it means that we still do n't know what the disease reservoir is , " @entity16 spokesman @entity38 told @entity1			0
" we need to establish where the virus is living in which animal it has its reservoir and then try to figure out how it 's being transmitted to people			2
all the evidence points to animal - to - human transmission but which animal and how is it being transmitted ? this is the big mystery			0
" authorities are monitoring more than 1,000 people who have come into close contact with confirmed cases , but @entity38 stressed " so far there 's no evidence of ongoing or sustained human - to - human transition of the virus			1
" particular attention is being paid to clusters of people who have contracted the illness , including one family where a father and two sons fell ill. the 87 - year - old father died of the virus in march , followed soon after by his younger son			2
it has n't been confirmed whether the son had the illness , according to @entity75 , director of the health emergency center of the @entity77			0
because he had died , further tests were n't possible , @entity75 added			0
the elder son was confirmed to have had the virus but has since recovered			0
he is one of five people who have been discharged from hospital after treatment , according to @entity15			1
so far , one boy is confirmed to have been an asymptomatic carrier of the virus , meaning he tested positive for the illness but did n't display any symptoms			0
the discovery of an asymptomatic carrier is worrying because it could make the spread of the infection more difficult to monitor , experts say			2
the four - year old was part of a sweep of people tested for the illness because they 'd come into close contact with the first reported case in @entity101			2
authorities took throat swabs from a group of people connected to 24 poultry farmers in @entity107 , @entity108 in @entity101 's @entity109 , according to the @entity110			2

the team includes @entity4 experts on epidemiology , laboratory tests and clinical treatment , as well as experts and officials from the @entity126 , the @entity127 and the @entity16 , who will " assess the outbreak and the response to guide further the prevention and control measures , " @entity16 spokesman @entity118 told reporters in @entity133 on tuesday			1
