-- the political culture in @entity2 , my home state , is often coarse , racialized and divisive			1
president @entity5 's visit there tuesday gave the world another opportunity to see it			1
at times it seems as though the most bigoted individuals in @entity12 's 48th state save their most raucous and prejudiced behavior for the 44th president			2
the @entity15 reported that hundreds of dissenters chose to model their insulting and extremist behavior before some of @entity20 's youngest residents			2
@entity22 outside @entity23 , they mocked @entity5 's race , singing " @entity26 " in spirited synchronization			1
one " patriot " went so far as to deprecate our commander in chief by pronouncing him " 47 percent @entity29 , " while another , @entity31 , held a sign that read , " impeach the @entity33 ! " @entity5 chose @entity23 , home to some of @entity20 's best and brightest students , to present his ideas for repairing @entity12 's ailing mortgage finance apparatus			1
some activists assembled to plead with the president to take more aggressive steps to combat climate change , such as renouncing the @entity45 oil pipeline			0
nevertheless , the overwhelming disposition of the angry horde was openly reminiscent of the @entity48			0
one of the most disturbing aspects of the @entity51 protest was the inclination of some participants to fault the president for increased racial tensions			0
" we have gone back so many years , " @entity56 told the @entity15 , insisting that @entity5 's presence and policies have engendered a racist backlash			1
" he 's divided all the races			0
i hate him for that			0
" this mind - bending perspective has become one of the leitmotifs of the racialized @entity70 movement , which laments regressive race relations , but which attributes increased racial tensions in @entity5 's " disruptive " and " exotic " presence , rather than their own racial stereotypes , hateful rhetoric and divisive behavior			1
despite myriad efforts to foster civil dialogue in @entity2 , the state has proven to be fertile ground for the kind of chauvinistic crusading that greeted @entity5 this week			1
the idea that @entity5 has divided the races is farcical			1
as i wrote in a @entity15 essay in march , @entity85 announced the selection of @entity5 as its person of the @entity89 ( for a second time ) because , as @entity97 argued in his editorial preface , " we are in the midst of historic cultural and demographic changes , and @entity5 is both the symbol and in some ways the architect of this new @entity12			2
" @entity5 deserved credit , he wrote , " for finding and forging a new majority , for turning weakness into opportunity and for seeking , amid great adversity , to create a more perfect union			2
" however , nearly five years into @entity5 's presidency , the politics of hope , optimism and racial equality that his campaign and election inspired have bumped into a new political reality marked by economic challenges , political acrimony and disillusionment			1
the resulting political backlash has triggered rancorous and racially charged clashes			0
the rowdy gathering outside @entity23 underscored the nature of race relations in the @entity5 age -- evolving but oddly static in some ways -- and the particularly bigoted shades of @entity51 emotion in @entity2			1
if the age of @entity5 prophesied a more progressive , multifaceted and refined dialogue about @entity12 race relations , the vision has not been realized			1
rather , many @entity12 , particularly xenophobic cliques such as the ones on display in my state , have recoiled back to a pre-civil rights - era temperament and increasingly overt racist outbursts			0
as brazen as those in the @entity23 crowd were , they are merely the most belligerent and public face of a legion of racist @entity51 persons			0
these more discreet individuals are smart enough to cloak their racialized opposition in obstructionist maneuvering and public policy that does more damage to the lives of people of color than prejudiced banter			0
still , the @entity23 protest should give everyone pause and put us on high alert			0
the racist rhetoric heard there reflects inner beliefs and fears that have tremendous potential to do great harm			0
@entity2 leaders would be remiss in dismissing it as " fringe			2
" as civil rights activist @entity169 once cautioned , " racism is like a deadly snake coiled and ready to strike , and one only avoids its dangers by never - ending watchfulness			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			2

@entity174 : @entity5 's *appearance* at @entity2 *school* brought out racist protesters
report : @entity180 said , " impeach the @entity33 ! " and some sang " @entity26 "
protesters blame @entity5 for race tension , but his *detractors* *promulgate* it , @entity172 says
@entity172 : @entity2 protesters were loud , but such racism is *ubiquitous* , should worry us all
