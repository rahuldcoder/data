-- @entity2 's longest war is expected to conclude by the end of next year , when the @entity2 plans to withdraw all its combat troops from @entity5			1
insurgents are still a " resilient and determined " threat , according to a @entity10 report released this week			0
@entity5 security forces must be fully trained to take over for @entity2 troops			1
and the two countries have to come to an agreement over what kind of troop presence the @entity2 will have in 2014			1
" how this war winds down is very important to @entity5 , to the @entity2 and so many other countries , " said @entity0 's @entity17 , who has been in @entity5 this week talking to @entity2 officials , troops and @entity5 civilians			1
" people paid for this with their lives			0
people have died , people have spent a decade of their lives fighting this war away from home			2
and of course , the @entity2 has spent about $ 650 billion on the war alone			1

here is an edited version of the conversation : @entity0 : you talked with defense secretary @entity43 on thursday			1
what 's he saying about the war effort ? has the @entity2 accomplished its mission ? @entity17 : @entity43 points out the success in bringing down key members of core @entity49 , and he believes he has made real progress on fighting @entity49 and terrorism in @entity5			1
but he acknowledges that insurgents are still a problem , and he acknowledges that @entity49 and terrorists have now spread and they 're in other places			0
he specifically mentioned to me @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			0
and he still thinks that @entity49 is the single biggest threat to the @entity2 homeland			1
@entity0 : what does that mean for @entity2 troops in @entity5 after the 2014 drawdown ? @entity17 : both @entity43 and ( @entity68 maj. gen. robert ) abrams , the regional commander in @entity69 , are very wary of discussing troop count			1
... some of it 's going to come down to the treatment of @entity2 troops ' indemnity , which @entity43 told me he 's sure wo n't be a problem but the deputy foreign minister here in @entity5 said was a serious issue that is on the table			1
we 're a long way away from having the details set in an agreement that the @entity2 would actually sign			1
i got the sense that the overall agreement is something that 's going to take a significant amount of time			1
@entity0 : are @entity5 forces going to be prepared by 2014 ? @entity17 : in @entity93 , traffic is a really huge problem , and they now have @entity96 doing the traffic control			1
traffic control is something we in @entity2 take for granted , but you can see there 's still a long way to go for them in terms of learning basic protocols			1
and that kind of fits in with the recent @entity10 report that said only one in 23 brigades of the @entity112 are actually ready to do their job from @entity114 -- from dealing with things like electricity to ( medical evacuations ) , whatever it is to operate a war			2
the deputy foreign minister i talked to said , " look that 's not really fair , we 're trying to train brigades on one thing at a time			2
" but you had issues like that			0
i talked to a @entity2 sergeant in @entity69 who works at a forward operating base and his job has now become training @entity5			1
i asked him what his relationship was with them			0
and he said he had to trust them completely and they were like his brothers			0
this is a guy who 's served four tours , missed three @entity141 , put a lot of time in			2
and he really was loyal to them			0
when i asked him explicitly , saying , " a lot of the coverage is pretty negative on how this training 's coming , what have you seen ? " he was very positive and he gave some examples on the communication they have with each other and their units and what significant progress he feels they have made			1
he really felt a sense of accomplishment and achievement , and you have to hope that his version of things ends up being the real version			2

some people we 've spoken to here sort of take it for granted that there 's going to be a civil war when the @entity2 leaves			1
it happened before when the @entity180 left			0
one female member of parliament i talked to , she was n't totally in that camp , but she was extremely afraid of it , saying : " i hope that it wo n't and i have to have confidence that we 're going to be able to overcome it			0
but yes , i have that fear			0
" and then there are others who really try to be more optimistic			2
we were at a bazaar today , and we asked a whole bunch of people whether they thought it was a good thing that the @entity2 was leaving			2
many said they were glad , and they basically said we 're glad because it 's time we take this on ourselves			2
there was a real sense of pride that they could do it			2
these were n't people in the military			0
these were regular people on the street			0
@entity0 : what else has stood out to you during your trip ? @entity17 : during the @entity31 , basically there were thousands of girls going to school in @entity5			1
now you have millions of girls going to school			0
so there 's been real progress on women 's rights			2
obviously , there remain a lot of problems -- honor killings , forced marriages , domestic violence -- but there has been real progress			0
there are women 's rights activists who are really afraid that when the @entity2 leaves , a lot of the progress will be rolled back			1
the female member of parliament i talked to , she is worried but hopeful			0
she has two daughters , 13 and 14			0
they really want to stay in their country , and they say , in their own experience , that there 's been such a change in what girls can do			2
one of them wants to be president			0
one of them wants to be a space engineer			0
it was a pretty cool and inspiring thing to see , but it sort of brought home the risks and what 's at stake here			0
... this was the most meaningful to me : the hopes that they have and the fact that they want to stay in their country and they want to fight for its future			0
if you have that going for you , then i think that 's probably the best sign of hope that there is			0

some @entity5 are optimistic about the change ; others are fearful of civil war
