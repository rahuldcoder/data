@entity0 -- @entity3 's top general said monday he did not believe the country 's soldiers " hurt civilians in cold blood " after newspaper reports quoted soldiers who said the army had treated @entity9 as a free - fire zone during its offensive this winter			1
@entity3 soldiers , just back from @entity9 , january 17 , 2009 , along the @entity9 - @entity3 border in @entity3			1
" i tell you that this is a moral and ideological army , " lt. gen. @entity17 , the chief of staff , said in a speech			0
@entity3 soldiers said last week that @entity22 civilians were killed and @entity22 property was intentionally destroyed during @entity3 's military campaign in @entity9 , according to the newspaper @entity25			1
about 1,300 @entity22 died during " @entity26 , " which aimed to stop militants from firing rockets into @entity3 from @entity9			1
the @entity29 has said it is investigating the claims			1
" i do n't believe that soldiers serving in the @entity29 hurt civilians in cold blood , but we shall wait for the results of the investigation , " @entity17 said			1
he blamed @entity37 , the militant @entity22 group which runs @entity9 , for choosing " to fight in heavily populated areas			1
" " it ( was ) a complex atmosphere that includes civilians , and we took every measure possible to reduce harm of the innocent , " he said , according to an @entity29 statement			2
the accounts in @entity25 are from @entity3 soldiers who graduated from a pre-military course at an @entity3 college			1
@entity48 soldiers complain in the reports that the rules of engagement often defied logic and left the impression with @entity3 troops that " inside @entity9 you are allowed to do anything you want			1
" " at first the specified action was to go into a house , " one squad leader is quoted as saying			0
" we were supposed to go in with an armored personnel carrier called an @entity62 [ which translates to " cruel " ] to burst through the lower door , to start shooting inside and then ... " i call this murder ... in effect , we were supposed to go up floor by floor , and any person we identified we were supposed to shoot			0
i initially asked myself : ' where is the logic in this ? ' " from above they said it was permissible , because anyone who remained in the sector and inside @entity78 was in effect condemned , a terrorist , because they had n't fled			0
i did n't really understand : on the one hand they do n't really have anywhere to flee to , but on the other hand they 're telling us they had n't fled so it 's their fault ... this also scared me a bit			0
" the @entity3 military 's advocate general ordered an immediate investigation into the soldiers ' accounts , the @entity3 military spokesman 's office said thursday			2
@entity3 defense minister @entity98 told @entity99 thursday that " @entity3 has the most moral army in the world " and that the accounts will be checked carefully			2
but graduates of the @entity105 pre-military preparatory program at @entity106 in @entity107 , the newspaper reported , gave accounts that ran counter to military claims that " @entity3 troops observed a high level of moral behavior during the operation			2
" the accounts were written down by the head of the college 's pre-military program , @entity119			0
he told @entity25 that he did not know what the soldiers were going to say and that what they heard " shocked us			0
" according to @entity25 , @entity119 passed on the soldiers ' comments to @entity17 , saying he " feared a serious moral failure in the @entity29			2
" contacted by @entity1 , @entity119 said he would not comment to the foreign media on the matter			0
he told an @entity3 television network that " what was most disturbing in this matter was the perception that they gave in certain units that the normative atmosphere was ' all is permissible ' when you are dealing with @entity22 homes , property , and in the most extreme cases also their lives			2
" in one account , a squad leader from a brigade serving in @entity9 described an incident in which an elderly @entity22 woman was shot and killed at the orders of a company commander			1
none of the @entity3 soldiers quoted in the @entity25 articles admitted to taking part first - hand in the killing of @entity22 civilians , and it is unclear whether all of them witnessed the events they described			1
" we take these allegations very seriously ... and if there was wrongdoing there will be consequences , " @entity3 government spokesman @entity160 said			0
" but this is second - , third - hand information , hearsay information			0
we have to get to the bottom , we have to get to the truth			0
" separately , a coalition of nine @entity3 human rights groups called on @entity3 attorney general @entity173 to reconsider his refusal to establish an independent investigative body to examine the military 's actions during the @entity9 campaign			1
the groups -- the @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 -- said accounts by @entity22 raise the possibility that acts by the military were worse than previously suspected			0
