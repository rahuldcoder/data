@entity1 is a human who made a mistake that he 'd never made before and that he wo n't make again , wife @entity0 said in an interview that aired monday			1
" @entity1 knows me , and there 's no way			2
he knows what he would have to deal with			0
... i 'm not going to sit there in silence and let something happen to me			0
and @entity10 forbid , in front of my child , just let it happen ? there 's no way			0
" it was @entity0 's second interview since her husband , a former running back for the @entity19 , viciously knocked her out in a casino elevator in @entity21 , @entity22 , after a night of heavy drinking			1
images from inside the elevator would change the pair 's lives , as @entity1 was indefinitely suspended by the @entity28 , and @entity0 became a poster child for domestic violence			1
the most shocking clip shows the 200 - pound football player punching his then - fiancee , sending her head into the wall before she collapses unconscious to the floor			1
surveillance video shows @entity1 drag her partially out of the elevator and callously dump her limp body face - first on the ground			1
" he said he was just terrified , " @entity0 told the " today " show in an interview that aired monday			1
" he was in such shock that this just happened , he did n't know how to function			0
" opening up sitting next to her mother , @entity46 , and occasionally fending off sniffles and dabbing her eyes with a tissue , @entity0 said she was angry and hurt by her husband 's violence , but it also hurt to see his career pulled out from under him , to lose the " support system " that the @entity19 provided and to be forced to " pick up and move			1
" she attributed @entity1 's actions that february night , which ended with both of them initially charged with simple assault , on " humanness			1
" " everybody makes mistakes			1
after this whole situation , you would think that we lived in a country full of people who never made a mistake , " she said			0
in a news conference arranged by the team three months after the incident , @entity1 apologized for the situation and to the @entity19 and the team 's fans			1
@entity0 then issued a controversial apology herself , saying , " i do deeply regret the role that i played in the incident			2
" the @entity19 tweeted her words and then deleted them after a firestorm of criticism from those who questioned why @entity0 would need to apologize after taking a left cross from a pro football player who benches 400 pounds			1
about that apology @entity1 told " today " she agreed to the press conference -- and to the @entity19 ' suggestion that she apologize -- because she thought it would help the situation			1
she dubbed the press conference " awkward " but defended her decision to apologize : " i did n't think it was completely wrong for me to apologize because at the end of the day , i got arrested , too			0
" as for the perception that her husband was not conciliatory , @entity0 refuted the notion , saying he apologized to her " countless " times			2
" i would n't be sitting there next to him if i was n't the first person to get an apology , " she said			0
the @entity19 initially defended their player and promised he 'd be back			2
a prosecutor would later drop the charges against @entity0 and upgrade @entity1 's charges to aggravated assault			1
a grand jury indicted him in march			0
@entity1 and @entity0 wed the next day			1
in july , after a disciplinary hearing , the @entity28 announced it would suspend @entity1 for two games , a decision widely panned as wide receiver @entity102 was kept off the field significantly longer after failing a drug test for marijuana			2
yet the league stuck by its decision until another surveillance video -- the one that captured the punch -- surfaced september 8			2
by the end of the day , the @entity19 had released @entity1 and the @entity28 made his suspension indefinite			2
' i was sick to watch it ' @entity0 never saw the second tape , saying she was " not going to let the public bring me back there			2
" her mother saw it , however , and said , " i was sick to watch it			0
" still , @entity0 , who has been critical of the media 's coverage of her and her husband , said the hardest part about remaining silent throughout the ordeal was seeing her life play out in the media			1
" that 's been the hardest part , is having so much of your life made public and have it all be negative			2
that 's the hardest part , is not having control over anything that has to do with you			2
it 's a natural thing for a human to want to come out and say , ' no , no. that 's not me , ' or ' no , that 's not true			0
' but it 's like a battle that we just ca n't win , " she said			0
monday 's " today " interview was the second time @entity0 has addressed the ordeal , speaking first to @entity149 , which granted her control over the final draft and release date of its story			1
during the interview , she discussed that night in @entity21 , the aftermath , how she and @entity1 met as teens and her disappointment in the @entity19 for summarily dismissing him after years of loyalty			1
could @entity1 return ? last week , an arbitrator found that the @entity28 abused its discretion by indefinitely suspending @entity1 when it had originally sat him down for only two games			0
the decision cleared @entity1 to play again , and @entity149 reports numerous teams are interested in the @entity166 standout			0
@entity0 concedes that if he is signed , it will be because a team was able to see past the jarring image of domestic violence that has come to define him			0
" for them to look past this situation , which i know is going to be hard , but at the end of the day , he 's a football player , " she said			0
" he 's proven himself as a football player for seven years			0
there 's never been a question of what he can do on the field			0
" while it remains to be seen , in this era of heightened concern over athletes and domestic violence , when @entity1 might next take the field , it 's abundantly clear that he will never lay another hand on @entity0 , she and her mother said			1
" there is no next time			0
we 've made that clear			0
there is no next time , " @entity46 told " today			0
" the show will air the second part of its interview with @entity0 on tuesday , including a portion of the interview in which her husband participated .			1
