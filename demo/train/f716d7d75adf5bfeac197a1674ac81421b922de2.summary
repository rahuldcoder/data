-- in designing modern and sustainable buildings in the @entity3 , architects are taking cues from an ancient @entity6 design tradition			1
a high - tech shading system running up the facade of the @entity9 in @entity10 was inspired by " mashrabiya , " latticed screens commonly seen in @entity14 architecture that diffuse sunlight and keep buildings cool without blocking light			1
" not allowing the sun to land directly on the skin of the building , causing overheating and glare , was a very simple concept , " said @entity18 , the buildings ' architect			1
" and that 's why using the mashrabiya , inspired from the past and inspired by nature , was a no brainer			1
" wrapping around most of the 25 - story buildings ' sides , the screens are arranged as an array of repeating geometric patterns and are computer - controlled to respond to the sun 's movement , unfolding like an umbrella when the sun hits them			1
the screens fold closed and the automated mechanism shuts off each day after the sun goes down			2
the north sides of the buildings never receive direct sunlight and are left unshaded by the screens			0
in @entity10 , solar rays can heat the outside surface of windows up to 90 degrees @entity51 , ( 200 degrees @entity52 )			0
by shielding the glass from the sun , the screens keep the buildings cool , reduce glare and let in diffused natural light			2
using this method , the buildings require less artificial lighting and 50 % less air conditioning			0
with the desert sun beating down on the cities in the @entity66 , solar energy is an important environmental factor in its cities			0
but desert dust and sand make photovoltaic panels less practical than one would expect in this part of the world			0
@entity18 says even a thin layer of dust can reduce the efficiency of solar panels by nearly half , and proper maintenance means regular cleaning using water jets pumping fresh water , a scarcity in an arid country like the @entity3			2
" you might find that you are spending so much energy to desalinate the water and get it to where it needs to be and then clean the panels , you 'll find out that that energy may equate or even exceed the energy that you get out of the photovoltaic panels , " he said			0
in @entity93 , the @entity94 , a striking cylindrical building , was designed along the same lines ; it is covered entirely in a latticed screen that uses a multi-layered pattern constructed of aluminum and glass			1
both structures were named as best buildings of 2012 by the @entity105 - based @entity104 and @entity106 , which recognizes sustainable architecture			0
the @entity3 is not normally thought of as a leader in combating climate change -- it has one of the highest levels of carbon dioxide emissions per capita in the world , according to the @entity114 -- but @entity10 has in recent years drawn attention for its innovative renewable energy building projects			1
most notable is @entity117 , its much - hyped , planned city that is still being constructed , it was originally slated as being a carbon neutral area but now aims for environmental sustainability			0
the area has green features like a 10 megawatt solar power plant and a 45 - meter - tall wind tower that helps regulate air temperatures in the public square by controlling air movement .			2

in the @entity3 , architects are taking cues from an ancient @entity6 design tradition .
a shading system on the facade of the @entity9 was inspired by latticed screens .
the screens are computer - controlled to respond to the sun 's movement .
@entity142 in @entity93 , a striking cylindrical building , was designed along the same lines .
