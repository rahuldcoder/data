-- thirty minutes into the movie " @entity2 " the audience sees a classic ' 80s montage scene , except there 's something a bit off			1
the film 's heroes , a group of five @entity10 students who are martial - arts experts ( and orphans ) , hit up the beach for some much needed fun in the sun. ( they 're in a band called @entity19 , which serves as a vehicle for their tae kwon do - inspired songs )			1
as the band members drive along the shore , they catcall out to women with painful lines such as " they do n't make buns like those down at the bakery , " trying to pick them up using phony @entity32 accents			2
the dialogue hardly matches up with the characters ' mouth movements , and the scene ends with two characters making out in the tide , waves crashing down around them			0
in the context of the film , nothing about this scene really drives the plot , furthers the character development or makes much sense at all			1
which is exactly why some fans consider it great			0
but the term " great " is relative			0
originally made in 1987 , " @entity2 " was rediscovered in june 2009 when @entity52 , a programmer at the @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity55 , came across it on @entity57 and made a blind bid on it			1
he won it for a mere $ 50 , having no idea he was the first step in the film 's unlikely comeback			1
" we played a reel in the ( @entity53 ) , and the few people that were in the theater went bananas , " @entity52 said			0
" we instantly scheduled the movie to play during our weekly exploitation series			1
" though it 's not always easy to figure out what exactly is going on in " @entity2 , " the story follows members of @entity19 as they find themselves mixed up with a group of ninjas linked to the bubbling cocaine trade out of @entity81			1
it stars grandmaster @entity83 , a central @entity84 martial - arts expert , who was pitched the idea of a feature - length film after director @entity87 saw him in the mid- ' 80s on the @entity89 talk show " meet at 11 p.m. " most of the actors and crew were @entity83 's tae kwon do students			1
with the assistance of funding from @entity83 and some investors , " @entity2 " was filmed in @entity98 and @entity81			1
@entity83 said he had high hopes that his creative work would find a distributor and explode onto the national scene			0
" when i finished the movie , i showed this to hundreds of different studios and distribution companies , " @entity83 said			2
" they all said , ' this is trash			0
do n't waste your time			0
' " still , @entity83 pressed on			0
the film opened in september 1988 , limited to eight theaters in the @entity98 area			2
he continued trying to get major distributors for a national release and even tried to rally @entity116 bigwigs at the prestigious @entity117			0
but the film bombed , and @entity83 saw his endeavor slip into obscurity ( along with the roughly $ 1 million it cost to make )			1
when @entity52 got a hold of it , enough time had passed so that it was received as something wholly different			0
he screened it around @entity54 and noticed a huge , positive response			0
moviegoers ate up the bad dialogue , laughed at the bad special effects and staged ninja fights , and reveled in a heavy dose of ' 80s cheese			1
@entity52 pushed the film to @entity134 , creative director for the @entity53 's distribution arm , @entity135			2
in december , @entity134 called @entity83 and told him he wanted to rerelease the movie			2
thinking it was some sort of cruel joke , @entity83 hung up several times			0
@entity134 courted him for months before the deal to resurrect " @entity2 " was made			1
now , decades later , thanks in part to the current love of irony and an enduring fascination with all things ' 80s , the film is enjoying an impressive victory lap. it screened at the @entity149 in july and @entity151 ' @entity150 in august , where the reaction was largely the same as @entity52 witnessed when he first discovered it			1
" what i 'd like to think is that people really get enthusiastic about the sincerity in the movie , " @entity52 said			2
" they initially get pulled in by the irony , the ' 80s fashion , but what 's underneath it is very entertaining			2
people respond to many different things , but they start to like the characters			0
" " @entity2 " is seeing the national rollout in theaters that @entity83 had always hoped would happen			1
dvds , blu - rays and soundtracks are available -- even vinyl singles for those wanting to keep things fittingly retro			2
@entity83 is going to a handful of showings and providing a martial - arts demonstration for moviegoers			1
the experience has taught @entity52 that " bad movies that people respond to are n't actually bad			0
" " there 's a sincerity within them that people latch onto , " he said			0
" there 's not a lot of technique or talent behind ' @entity2			1
' but there 's so much initiative and dedication behind it , even if they failed at what they were trying to do			0
they were really into it and really trying			0
that 's why people are responding to it now			0
" " @entity2 " opens november 9 in @entity151 and @entity199 , with a nationwide release in other cities scheduled through december .			1

" @entity2 " follows the *adventures* of a group of *college* martial - arts experts
the movie bombed in the ' 80s but was *purchased* recently on @entity57 for $ 50
moviegoers in @entity55 loved its ' 80s cheese , and the film is now being rereleased
