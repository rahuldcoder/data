@entity0 , @entity1 -- when i found the first piece of fuselage , i was shocked			1
it was flimsy , the thin metal easily twisted back on itself			2
@entity12 on one side , some yellow on the other , it sat in a small puddle of mud a few feet from the road			2
i was half a mile from the runway , the tall silver birch trees nearby broken like so many matchsticks			1
somehow i thought planes were supposed to be stronger than this , but what i was confronted with was an object lesson on the precarious nature of flying			2
the evidence of what had happened was clear			0
the plane struck the trees , at first just grazing their uppermost branches and then their slender boughs and trunks			1
it was enough to rip the plane apart			0
what feels almost invincible as it powers through takeoff and thrusts upward through the skies at hundreds of miles an hour had been reduced to shreds of metal , little more than a discarded tin can			0
these are the thoughts that flashed through my mind in those first moments of discovery			1
and that 's when the horror of it sinks in			1
the last tragic moments for all aboard ; it 's impossible to imagine the awfulness of those final seconds			1
i am swept by another emotion , sadness for the families , and i feel captured by an undefined grief			0
i knew no one aboard , but to see how their lives ended is to know a tiny fraction of the pain their loved ones must bear			0
but i have come to work , to tell the story of what happened , to piece together the small bits of information we 'll get , to make some sense of our corner of this huge tragedy			0
so that is what my team and i do			0
@entity79 , my producer , and @entity81 , our cameraman , get to work and set up the first live shot			0
it 's cold in @entity0 -- there are still piles of snow here and there			1
none of us have had much sleep			0
@entity81 arrived 12 hours ahead of us , @entity94 and i flew in from @entity95			0
all of us took the 400 - kilometer drive from @entity97 to get here			0
each of us intent on our job , each of us grappling with the enormity of the day			0
no day is ever normal at @entity2 , but this defies even that logic			1
a president , his wife , many of the country 's top military , political and religious leaders killed in a country that 's not their own			2
the implications could be huge			0
as the day wore on and more details emerged , it seemed clear @entity1 wanted to make it known it was not at fault			1
evidence pointed toward the pilots rather than a mechanical error			0
prime minister @entity118 , who is leading @entity1 's investigation , was on course to lay blame at @entity123 's door			1
he has a reputation as a tough autocrat , and it seemed to me that 's what we are seeing here			2
but we got to see another face of @entity118 , too : the stony - faced solemn friend of @entity123			1
there seemed little doubting his grief and seriousness as he stood at the foot of the @entity123 president 's casket during the long sombre repatriation ceremony we witnessed that afternoon			1
having stood among the wreckage and broken trees as he has , it is not hard to imagine that this iron man of @entity1 politics was moved by what he saw			1
for who among us , however familiar with tragedy , could fail to be touched by the scale and nature of @entity123 's loss .			2

@entity2 's @entity155 writes from scene of *air* crash in @entity1
difficult to think of the horror of *passengers* ' last moments
broken trees *suggest* *air*plane hit them and *disintegrated*
@entity1 's @entity118 is solemn at fallen leader 's casket
