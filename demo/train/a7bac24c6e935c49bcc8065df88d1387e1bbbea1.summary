others twisted in their chairs during the testimony , while many intently took notes			2
but about eight victims into the litany of death certificates , the jurors appeared more relaxed			2

they included @entity41 , who was expecting a baby boy when he was shot 20 times on a @entity0 boulevard in 1973			0
" the most significant of the 20 was a wound to his right shoulder which pierced the spinal cord and lodged in his neck region , " @entity9 explained			0

" going through it was rough , but i know every word on that death certificate , " @entity70 said after monday 's testimony			2
he brandished the document , which he has carried to court every day since the beginning of the trial , as he spoke			2
prosecutors say @entity8 had a nearly 20 - year reign of terror as the head of the @entity99 , the @entity101 mob that once terrorized @entity0			1

@entity115 said the @entity102 cut ties with @entity63 in 1982			0
