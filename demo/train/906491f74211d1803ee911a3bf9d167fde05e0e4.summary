-- president @entity1 on thursday called on business leaders from the private sector to generate ideas that will " accelerate job creation " and stimulate investment in the @entity7			1
" while i believe that government has a critical role in creating the conditions for economic growth , ultimately , true economic recovery is only going to come from the private sector , " @entity1 told attendees of the at the @entity9 on @entity10 and @entity11			1
more than 100 ceos , small - business owners , business leaders , mayors and academics attended			1
" we do n't have enough public dollars to fill the hole of private dollars that was created as a consequence of the crisis			2
it is only when the private sector starts to reinvest again ; only when our businesses start hiring again and people start spending again and families start seeing improvement in their own lives again , that we 're going to have the kind of economy that we want , " @entity1 said			1
the summit took place amid allegations from members of @entity1 's own party that the @entity9 and the @entity42 congressional leadership are not doing enough to help the unemployed			1
critics called the summit nothing more than a publicity stunt , and some are threatening to organize a march on @entity48 if efforts to get more aid fail			1
" obviously , there 's something that 's not getting through to them , " said rep. @entity51 , @entity52			0
" we 'll get the @entity7 people involved			0
you know , i can see a day , unless we get some real cooperation and real help , i can really see a day where there will be a jobless march on @entity64			1
@entity66 , @entity67 , and @entity68 , @entity69 , chair the new congressional @entity70 , which is made up of 112 @entity42 and 17 @entity71			0

yet @entity1 projected a positive tone as he recounted some of the day 's discussions , on topics from clean energy and tax incentives to the export market , and the overlap among them			2

" when we were in the clean energy session , there was an emphasis on how do we get small businesses and small contractors to get certified and get the financing needed to move forward and take advantage of these clean energy sector opportunities , " he said			2
" there 's a lot of overlap between all these different breakout sessions that we engaged in , " he said			0
" we 're going to have to figure out how to break out of these silos and integrate these strategies if we 're going to be able to get the most bang for the buck			0
" coinciding with the jobs forum , organized labor and religious leaders in several cities sponsored events featuring unemployed and underemployed people to raise the public profile of the issue			2
