-- before @entity3 even aired " @entity5 @entity4 ! " on thursday night , its star , @entity1 , asked viewers not to hate - watch it			1
unfortunately , @entity7 did n't totally grant that wish			0
although the live musical production garnered some celeb praise and a few pats on the back for its star , some critics and viewers concluded they were right to worry that it would n't fly			1
" @entity5 may have overcome the tyranny of time , but he could n't surmount the constrictions of a television screen , " wrote @entity18 writer @entity17			1
" or a wooden screenplay			1
" the special , which featured " girls " star @entity1 as the eternally young @entity5 and @entity26 as captain hook , had been highly anticipated after @entity3 's ratings success with " @entity30 ! " starring @entity31			1
deadline reported that the latest production tumbled in early ratings , down 46 % from last year 's live show			1
though " @entity30 ! " did well with the numbers , it was ripped to shreds by some viewers , and the expectation was that the new show would n't be much better			2
but according to @entity43 's @entity42 , " @entity5 " proved to be just underwhelming			2
" no , it 's not that @entity5 @entity4 ! was the ' @entity30 ! ' train wreck our heads are still spinning over , like @entity31 twirling maniacally on a soundstage hilltop , " @entity44 wrote			2
" it 's that ' @entity5 live ! ' was boring			1
" perhaps trying to liven things up , viewers amused themselves on social media			1
one tweeted , " apparently @entity53 is just a backdrop at @entity55			0
" even " @entity58 " star @entity57 got in on the fun , tweeting , " all of this needs more cowbell # @entity56 , " a nod to @entity26 's now - classic " snl " skit			2
actress @entity64 tweeted , " increasingly worried this is going to turn into a " @entity66 " situation for @entity68			0
" @entity26 did n't win any raves for his singing , but @entity71 of @entity72 found the actor to be " simultaneously playing himself and playing captain hook , though for some long stretches one could n't be sure if he was forgetting lines left and right or just letting the play breathe			0
" " seriously , you ca n't underestimate the @entity80 , " @entity71 wrote			0
" if you do n't like him , well , this was not a three - hour musical for you , because during vast stretches of it @entity26 seemed to be doing something else entirely than his fellow singers and actors			2
but for those who love the @entity91 , that level of odd behavior , moments of outright weirdness and his own brand of playing cool in chaos was precisely what made @entity3 's gambit work			0
" one person who knew all too well the experience of presenting a musical live on national tv gave it a thumbs up			0
" i hope the cast & crew of # @entity56 feel so happy & proud right now , " @entity107 tweeted			0
" what an incredible thing you all were a part of tonight ! amazing ! ! ! " .			0
