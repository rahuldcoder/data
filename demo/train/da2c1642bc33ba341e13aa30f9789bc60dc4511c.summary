@entity0 -- few items are more highly prized among collectors of historical artifacts than a handwritten letter from president @entity6			1
this letter from president @entity6 to treasury secretary @entity8 has been returned to the government			1
now , there 's one fewer in circulation			0
an @entity13 collector handed over to the federal government thursday a rare handwritten letter from @entity6 to treasury secretary @entity8			1
the letter , dated four days before @entity6 delivered the @entity17 in 1863 , had been missing for more than 60 years			1
federal officials , who have not ruled out its possible theft from a government collection , discovered it two years ago during routine monitoring of online auctions			0
they have been negotiating for its return ever since			0
in the short note , torn from the center of a bound volume , @entity6 tells @entity8 to do a small favor on behalf of someone recently fired from his job with the federal government			1
" mr. ( @entity35 ) @entity34 , late superintendent of the @entity36 at @entity37 , asks to have a copy , or be permitted to examine , and take extracts , of the evidence upon which he was removed , " @entity6 writes			2
" please oblige him in one way or the other			0
" @entity43 , a former prosecutor who collects artifacts ranging from @entity46 antiquities to presidential documents , said he had owned the document for several years and considers it a " cornerstone " example of @entity6 's compassion			1
@entity34 , according to @entity43 , was " a guy who was let go or lost his position or otherwise fired , and he wanted to look at his personnel file to find the reasons why he was let go			2
" but officials at the @entity57 suggested that there was more involved than just @entity6 's well - known practice of personally responding to letters from constituents			1
@entity62 , a senior official at the @entity57 , said @entity6 was taking care of some political business even as the @entity65 raged			1
@entity34 was the brother - in - law of sen. @entity70 of @entity71 , a close colleague of @entity6 's when the two practiced law in @entity68			2
@entity70 , who was politically influential in the western @entity72 , was killed in the @entity65 two years before @entity6 requested the favor for @entity34			1
@entity62 said " this document shows his regard for the senator			0
it shows his interest , even in the midst of the @entity65 , in political issues on the @entity81			0
... it 's quite important			0
" @entity43 said his nature as a prosecutor made him question government officials when they first sought to retrieve the letter , which had been in private hands for decades			1
initially , according to @entity43 , an investigator reached him on his cell phone and asked him to just send the document back by registered mail			2
" i do n't work like that , " @entity43 said			2
he said , " it took them quite a while to prove to me it was once theirs			0
" @entity43 asked them this month whether he " could see the volume that they claimed held the other half of the letter			2
" " they opened it up , and it did n't match , " he said			0
" my half of the letter was not the same size of the half they have			0
" @entity43 was later convinced , however , when investigators showed how an untrimmed edge matched the torn remains in the volume , along with other evidence they felt established the source of @entity43 's document			2
he declined to say how much he paid for the @entity6 letter at an auction in 2006 but said a similar document in the president 's handwriting is currently for sale at an asking price of $ 78,000			1
with television cameras , reporters and photographers capturing the moment , @entity43 handed the formerly lost @entity6 letter to a @entity57 official			1
" here it is , " he said			0
" i appreciate the opportunity " to donate it during the bicentennial of @entity6 's birth			0
