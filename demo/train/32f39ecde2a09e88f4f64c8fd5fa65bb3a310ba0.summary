-- how much should the rest of the world worry about the crisis unfolding in @entity4 ? for anyone who cares about the state of their personal finances and the size of their reserves for retirement , the answer is : a lot			1
for investors , it 's a time of risk and opportunity			1
investors exhaled with some relief sunday after voters in @entity21 gave a narrow victory to @entity23 , a party that vows to work with @entity4 leaders to keep the struggling country in the eurozone			1
but the crisis is nowhere near solved			2
@entity21 has to find a way to stability while @entity30 and @entity31 , much more important economies , show worrisome signs			0
when scenarios of " @entity36 " and " @entity37 " are evoked , you know things are getting bad			0
because in today 's interdependent and hyper - connected world , no continent can feel secure while another is sliding economically			2
what happens in @entity4 has the potential to determine the outcome of the @entity46 presidential election in november			1
it could trip up @entity46 's feeble recovery , create more unemployment and take a toll on the global stock market			1
conversely , if @entity4 manages to avoid a financial storm , it could remove a huge cloud of uncertainty hanging over the global economy and brighten the outlook -- and the portfolios -- of investors everywhere			1
pro-euro @entity21 right tries , again , to form government if you doubt that @entity4 problems could affect @entity46 shores , take a quick glance at history for a chilling lesson			1
prominent economists have drawn an eerie parallel between today 's events and those of the early 1930s when , as the world limped in the aftermath of the 1929 @entity76 crash , a banking crisis in @entity4 took the world economy into another downward spiral and led to an explosion of extremist politics that , ultimately , set the pathway to @entity82 if you do n't care about the politics , consider just the stock market in the last 100 years			1
the @entity86 , which stood at 381 in early september 1929 , lost half of its value in the two months after the @entity89 of october			0
but the worst was yet to come			0
by 1932 , the index had plummeted a breathtaking 90 % from the september highs , dropping to just 41			0
the years after the 1929 crash brought a stomach - churning roller - coaster ride			2
the @entity86 climbed more than 400 % from 41 to 194 and then back down to 92 , before stabilizing and resuming a relatively steady climb during @entity82 imagine seeing your savings , your retirement funds , cut to one - tenth their size			0
it took a quarter of a century for the market to return to pre-crash levels			2
those who bought stocks when the index stood at 41 saw their investment eventually soar to spectacular heights -- especially those who picked the right stocks at the right time			2
( the tycoon , @entity110 , among others , started building his fortune by snapping up bargain stocks			0
) so what do those events in the 1930s , which unfolded when bankers , politicians and investors knew so much less about the economy , have to do with our world , the age of the @entity124 , the era of unlimited access to information and advanced economic theories ? if @entity4 leaders and the voters who elect them glean the right lessons from history and manage to steer their continent away from the edge of the cliff , then we wo n't see a repeat of that disaster of a global crash			1
but no one knows whether @entity4 will get their economic problems straightened out			1
this means that anyone who owns stocks or other investments should take a deep breath and decide just how much risk he or she is willing to accept			2
most @entity46 own stocks through mutual funds			2
millions have their money in employee - provided retirement accounts and rely on the stock market for their future without realizing it			1
many top - rated investors are minimizing their stake in the market			1
the legendary @entity159 says he 's pessimistic and not buying stocks			0
he 's buying gold and other commodities			0
the investment giant @entity163 is telling clients to stock up on cash and safe - haven bonds and treasury bonds even though this is not the best strategy in the long run since it provides negative returns when you factor in inflation			0
for the more adventurous and optimistic , there 's the lure of potentially huge returns , if @entity4 dodges disaster , or , in the aftermath of a crash			1
@entity4 leaders are getting strong advice from all directions			2
while the @entity21 suffer , the @entity30 face severe unemployment , and fringe political parties spring up and grow stronger , economists from both sides of the @entity184 are urging @entity188 chancellor @entity187 to reverse course from her push for strict austerity , which is choking economies already in depression			0
my sense is that @entity187 will do whatever it takes to not let the eurozone come apart and will ease up on austerity while the storm passes			0
but nobody has a crystal ball ; not for the market , not for the politicians			0
for investors , the most important point to keep in mind is that these are not days like others			0
it is a time of crisis , of great risk and , as happens when there is great risk , also of potentially great rewards			1
those who wish to take the risk should do it with eyes wide open , not by accident , neglect or inertia			0
the epicenter of the crisis may be in @entity4 , but the shockwaves will know no boundaries			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			0

@entity229 : anyone who cares about personal finance needs to pay attention to @entity4 's crisis
@entity235 : @entity4 's problems could have huge impact on the @entity46 , just look at the 1930s
she says investors are reducing their stake in the stock market in fear of a big crash
@entity235 : it 's a time of great risk , but also of potentially great reward
