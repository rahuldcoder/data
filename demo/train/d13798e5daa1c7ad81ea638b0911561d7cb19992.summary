-- the @entity1 won their first @entity2 in 39 years , defeating the @entity3 4 - 0 wednesday night in the seventh and deciding game of the @entity6 's annual championship			1
the loss did n't go over well with hundreds of mostly young @entity3 fans , who took to the streets and set several overturned vehicles afire a few blocks from @entity12 where the game was played			1
some fans stopped to pose in front of the flames			2
others danced on top of another overturned vehicle			0
a dull cloud of gray smoke choked some areas of downtown			0
@entity24 : fires , rioting and looting in @entity28 aerial footage showed @entity28 police wading into the unruly crowd that continually taunted and threw things at the officers			1
members of the crowd leaped over one street fire , and officers wrestled several fans to the ground			0
" we 're unable to release anything formal at the moment but officers are busy dealing with a few core groups of people bent on committing criminal acts like mischief , vandalism , and fights , " @entity40 officer @entity39 said in a statement			0
" we 're working hard to get everyone home safe			0
" freelance journalist @entity52 told @entity0 that 1,000 - 2,000 people were on the streets in downtown @entity28 , and that six police vehicles had been set on fire			1
after dropping the first two games in @entity28 , the @entity1 took four of the last five games from the @entity3 , who struggled to stay in @entity60 after going down 1 - 0 in the first period			1
the @entity1 blew open the game in the second , after rookie @entity64 sprung on a rebound off of @entity3 goalie @entity66 to put away his second goal of the match			2
" we knew the second goal was going to be huge , " @entity64 , the 23 - year - old rookie said in a post-game interview			0
" it was nice to get that one , and we kept pushing forward after that			0
" @entity64 would finish the game with two goals and one assist			0
but the game was really decided by @entity78 , who polished off his spectacular playoff performance with a @entity60 shutout to take the coveted @entity82 trophy			0
@entity78 -- whose unorthodox goalkeeping mystified the @entity3 all night -- set the @entity6 record for most shots faced and most saves in playoff history			1
he also shattered @entity89 's 1960s record for most saves in a @entity2 final			2
coming into the series , @entity28 was considered the superior squad on special teams , especially on power plays			2
but that was n't the case in this year 's @entity2 , as @entity1 put away five power play goals to @entity28 's two			1
@entity28 was also outscored 10 - 0 in the second period			1
" we finally brought our game from home on the road , " @entity100 told @entity101			0
" we played physical and took care of the puck , played extremely hard and paid attention to the details			0
" @entity111 's first period goal should have been enough for fans to know the game 's outcome , as the team that scored the first goal won every game in this series			2
the @entity1 now have won the @entity2 six times , fourth-most among all @entity6 franchises , but had n't captured the sport 's most coveted prize since 1972			1
they had been to the finals five other times since they last won , but this time marked their first appearance since 1990			2
the @entity3 have been to the finals three times in their 40 seasons in the league , but have never won			0
holding the home - ice advantage , they won the first two games of the series , but lost all three games played in @entity1 before losing at home on wednesday			1
they were seeking to become the first @entity140 team to win the @entity6 title since the @entity142 in 1993 .			1
