@entity0 -- @entity2 will not open a criminal investigation into the airstrike that killed 10 members of a @entity7 family and two of their neighbors during the november 2012 war with @entity11			1
@entity2 's @entity12 ( @entity13 ) revealed its decision last week in a report that examined allegations of misconduct during @entity18			1
the report looked into 80 incidents during the eight days of intense fighting that included @entity2 air strikes and @entity7 rocket launches			1
the independent advocate general said it needed more information on 15 cases , but found no basis for a criminal investigation in the other 65 incidents -- including the strike that killed 10 members of the @entity34 family			1
on november 18 , the @entity34 family -- including five women and four small children -- was inside their three - story home when the @entity2 air force dropped a bomb that obliterated the dwelling			1
the explosion also heavily damaged two neighboring houses , killing two other people			2
neighbors tried desperately to pull people out of the rubble alive but none survived			2
the @entity12 report called the deaths " regrettable " but said the military took " various precautions to reduce the possibility of collateral damage " and " the incident did not raise suspicion " of a criminal offense			1
during the conflict , the @entity2 military changed its story several times as to who the intended target in the home was			1
the day of the strike , @entity1 was told the target was @entity66 , who the military said was the head of @entity70 ' rocket unit			0
he was not among the dead			2
@entity72 said the military then changed its story , saying it was targeting @entity74 , who did live in the home , identifying him as a @entity70 militant			2
@entity78 denied the allegation about his now - deceased son			0
but in the days and weeks after the incident , @entity72 said it found evidence on the ground and on the internet that lead the group to believe @entity86 was a low - level member of @entity70 ' armed wing and therefore a legitimate target			0
but the rights group still condemned the way in which @entity2 went about trying to kill him			1
" under the laws of war , that person would be a legitimate target			0
the @entity2 strike blew up an entire house , severely damaged the neighboring houses and killed 12 people -- to us that looks very disproportionate			1
the level of damage to civilians and civilian infrastructure was not adequately related to an attack on one militant , " @entity72 senior researcher @entity103 said shortly after the group put out its own report on the november war			0
in an unspecified number of cases , however , the @entity12 report did admit mistakes were made that lead to civilian deaths			1
" there is indeed basis for the claim that as a result of @entity126 attacks , uninvolved civilians were killed or injured , or civilian property damaged , usually as unintended damage resulting from an attack against military targets or alternatively from operations errors where civilians were mistakenly identified as terrorist operatives , " the report said			0
the @entity134 , one of the non-profit groups that sent evidence and filed complaints about some of the deadly strikes , attacked the findings of the report			0
" ... @entity134 believes that @entity2 's legal system is used as a smokescreen , to provide an illusion of investigative rigor , while in fact providing systematic cover for widespread violations of international law , " that group said in a statement			1
the report is also being condemned by @entity72 as " insufficient " and at times " based on a mistaken interpretation of the laws of war			0
" " just saying that the fatal consequences of an attack were unintended or a mistake does not , of course , make the attack lawful , " @entity103 said in an e-mail to @entity1			0
@entity78 , the father and grandfather who lost almost all of his immediate family in the november 18 airstrike , including four grandchildren under the age of 8 , told @entity1 the incident has left him feeling like he , too , is dead			1
" i call on everyone and the world whether @entity172 or @entity173 or an @entity174 or @entity175 or @entity176			0
i call for the free world and the ones who have democracy and ethics to stand with me and support me and bring the @entity2 government to justice for what they have done to me			2
they have massacred my entire family , " he said			0
@entity2 's military said it conducted some 1,500 strikes during the november incursion in @entity11 and took many precautions to avoid killing civilians			1
in videos shown to @entity1 , the military illustrated how it dropped leaflets , aborted many missions if civilians were in the line of fire , and used high - precision weapons with pinpoint accuracy to avoid collateral damage			0
" any loss of human life is a tragedy			0
and as we proved in @entity18 , we are putting great effort in order to reduce the amount of civilian casualties in the state of conflict , " lt. col. @entity204 said			0
but @entity7 scoff at @entity2 's assertion , saying if that is true , why were so many civilians killed ? according to a @entity216 report , at least 168 @entity7 were killed by @entity2 during the conflict -- 101 of them civilians , including 33 children and 13 women			1
@entity2 disputes that breakdown of the numbers , telling @entity1 it killed at least 100 " terrorists " during the war			2
six israelis , including four civilians , were killed by rockets fired by armed groups in @entity11 during the conflict			2
the @entity2 @entity13 report also said the son of a @entity231 journalist who died in the fighting was likely killed by a @entity7 rocket and not @entity2 fire , as had been widely reported			2
the @entity216 @entity235 also looked into that case and last month reached the same conclusion			0
@entity72 accused @entity2 of war crimes in the fighting and lodged the same charge against @entity70 and other @entity7 armed groups in @entity11 for indiscriminate rocket attacks on @entity2 population centers			1
both governments have denied the charges			0
timeline : @entity2 - @entity11 conflict read more : @entity247 : @entity11 strikes could be beginning of ground attack read more : calm elusive as rockets rain in @entity11 , @entity2			1

an airstrike on a family home in @entity11 in november left 10 people dead

@entity2 's @entity12 said no criminal probe needed in the case
