@entity0 -- a head - bopping , hip - shaking flurry of drum beats			0
the soulful screams of a saxophone			0
the gut - thumping strums of a double bass			0
and the silky smooth lyrics of @entity10 -- the lullaby classic made famous by @entity12 -- all under a starlit night			0
the scene could be straight from an outdoor @entity15 festival in @entity16			2
but this is @entity18 -- a country plagued by its reputation for @entity21 militancy , corruption and poverty -- and the jazz is courtesy of three @entity16 and a @entity26 who make up the @entity28			1
the four performed at a 500 - seat amphitheater on the outskirts of the capital , @entity0 , in a country @entity32 musicians almost never visit because of security concerns and widespread anti-americanism			2
the @entity36 helped organize the band 's visit as part of a cultural exchange program designed to win @entity18 hearts and minds			1
" we do n't feel like we 're in danger , " said the band 's creator and bassist @entity43			2
" we 're thrilled to be here			0
we feel welcome , so at home			0
" the band 's visit comes at a time when relations between the @entity32 and @entity18 governments are strained			1

@entity0 hit back with it 's own tough talk , accusing @entity66 of using @entity18 as a scapegoat for its failed policy in the region and warning the @entity32 might lose @entity18 as an ally if it continues with the public accusations			1
the @entity73 is under no illusion that it can solve the @entity32 - @entity18 rift but jazz can help , they said			1
" music has a history of bringing people together from across the world , " said @entity43			0
but the band acknowledged the hearts and minds @entity32 needs to win were probably not among their audience			1
the concert was invite only , not open to the public			0
the guests were mostly foreign diplomats , @entity18 politicians and their families -- many educated in the west , people who probably already like @entity32			1
even so , the quartet said this was a start			0
they drew loud cheers when they performed their jazzed up rendition of @entity100 , the country 's most patriotic song			0
more applause came when they joined @entity18 rock band @entity104 for a song called @entity106 is life			2
within seconds @entity32 and @entity18 musicians were in soulful synchrony			2
if only @entity32 - @entity18 relations were that easy .			1
