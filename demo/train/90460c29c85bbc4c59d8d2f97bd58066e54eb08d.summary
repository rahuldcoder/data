-- a week after claiming a hacker had posted a lewd photo to his @entity6 account , @entity2 rep. @entity1 on monday apologized for lying about the incident and admitted carrying on inappropriate relationships with several women he 'd met online			1
@entity1 , a @entity12 @entity11 , said he is not resigning his seat , nor is he planning on separating from his wife			1
but he said he took " full responsibility " for his actions -- both the relationships and for lying about sending the photo last month of his bulging underwear on his @entity6 account			0
" to be clear , the picture was of me , and i sent it			0
i 'm deeply sorry for the pain this has caused my wife , and our family , my constituents , my friends , my supporters and my staff , " he said , claiming he 'd posted the @entity6 photo accidentally as a " joke " and then " panicked			2
" " i lied because i was ashamed at what i had done , and i did n't want to get caught			1
" an emotional @entity1 described his actions as " dumb , " " destructive " and " deeply , deeply hurtful " -- both for his admitted coverup and for repeatedly engaging in " inappropriate conversations conducted over @entity6 , @entity35 , e-mail and occasionally on the phone " with women he 'd met online , mostly via @entity35			1
the congressman claimed that he never met any of these women in person , and that his wife @entity43 only learned he 'd been lying about the @entity6 picture on monday morning			1
" i have made terrible mistakes , " @entity1 told reporters			2
" i have not been honest with myself or my family			0
... i should not have done this , and i should not have done this particularly when i was married			0
" @entity1 claimed he does not believe he used any government resources , while he " exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years			1
" some of those relationships began before his 2010 marriage and some happened , and continued , afterward			0
still , @entity58 minority leader @entity57 announced that she would call " for an @entity60 investigation to determine whether any official resources were used or any other violation of @entity58 rules occurred			2
" @entity1 issued a statement saying he would " welcome and fully cooperate " with the probe , which other @entity67 leaders also rallied behind			1
but one @entity69 source called the move " hollow , " saying @entity57 should have insisted that @entity1 resign -- as former rep. @entity71 , a @entity12 @entity69 , did in february amid reports that the married man had tried to solicit women via @entity75			1
the seven - term congressman said during his press conference that he 'd talked with @entity57 briefly that day , saying she was " not happy " but " also told me that she loved me and wanted us to ... pull through this			1
" he hails from @entity12 's solidly @entity67 9th district , which includes parts of the @entity84 boroughs of @entity85 and @entity86			1
he handily won re-election last november , besting his @entity69 challenger by 22 points			0
if @entity1 were to resign or be compelled to leave office , @entity12 gov. @entity90 , also a @entity11 , would determine the timing of a special election to replace him			1
monday afternoon 's admission came hours after images were published on @entity97 , a conservative website run by @entity99 , that purportedly showed @entity1 shirtless			2
before the congressman spoke at his scheduled 4 p.m. press conference , @entity99 -- who claimed he just happened to be staying at a hotel a few blocks down -- unexpectedly took over the podium to challenge @entity1 and the media and defend his site 's story			2
" this is an ongoing story , this is a compelling story , " said @entity99 , bristling at reports he orchestrated the issue for political purposes and was responsible for hacking @entity1 's account			2
" i did not like that he doubled down that this is about @entity99			0
" the conservative blogger also claimed that he had , in his possession , another " x-rated " photo allegedly from @entity1 that he said he was n't releasing because he hoped " to save ( @entity1 's ) family			1
" " i 'd like an apology , " a defiant @entity99 said			0
" this was his strategy , which is to blame me for hacking			0
" during his press conference , @entity1 apologized " to everyone that i misled in the media " -- including @entity99 -- but most of all to his wife			1
" this was me doing a dumb thing , and doing it repeatedly , then lying about it , " @entity1 said			2
@entity99 's website was the first to publish an incriminating photo , sent may 27 via @entity6 from @entity1 's account of a man in his underwear			2
@entity1 initially released written statements claiming that he was the victim of a hacker and a prank			2
then , during a testy press conference , he dodged questions about whether the photo was of him and why he had n't asked law enforcement to investigate if his account had , indeed , been compromised			0
the following day , in a series of interviews , he said he could not say with " certitude " if the photograph was of him			0
he has also deflected recent questions from @entity0 , saying he had hired an attorney at the firm of @entity150 to look into the matter			0
the woman who received the @entity6 photo in late may , @entity154 , denied on her own account that she was one of the six women who @entity1 admitted having an " inappropriate relationship			1
" but @entity158 reports that @entity159 , a 26 - year - old single mother from @entity161 , provided them with dozens of photos , e-mails , facebook messages and cell phone call logs related to her relationship with @entity1			0
in a posting on @entity97 , @entity168 said she was a @entity170 veteran and full - time college student who , on april 20 , went to @entity1 's @entity35 page and commented that the congressman was " hot " on one of his videos			0
she said the two began corresponding " within an hour , " adding that she did n't know if he is a " horrible person " but decided to speak out after hearing he 'd " hired an investigative firm to go through all of his files			0
" @entity0 has attempted to contact @entity168 , but she could not be immediately reached for comment			0
many @entity67 first rallied around the liberal congressman			0
but members of the @entity58 @entity67 leadership have talked repeatedly in recent days to try to get him to end what has become an unwelcome political distraction , a member of the party 's leadership told @entity0 before @entity1 's press conference monday			1
" it 's frustrating because we 'll talk to him , and say clean it up , and then he goes out and does stuff , " said the member of the @entity58 @entity67 leadership , who declined to speak on the record about private discussions with @entity1			1
" he 's got to put the period at the end of the sentence , " the @entity67 source said before @entity1 's confession			1
" whatever voters might decide in 17 months when he 's next on the ballot , @entity0 contributor and longtime @entity67 insider @entity206 said that @entity1 has hurt himself considerably among fellow members of his party			1
one big reason is that his wife , @entity43 , had been a longtime aide to secretary of state @entity213 -- with former president @entity214 even officiating the couple 's nuptials last july			0
" right now , the @entity67 are furious at this guy , " said @entity206			1
" he is married to one of the most popular people in the @entity67 party			0
" @entity0 's @entity221 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity206 says @entity67 are " furious " at @entity1 , whose wife has ties to the @entity226
the @entity12 @entity11 says he will cooperate with an ethics probe called by @entity57
@entity1 says he " lied because he was ashamed " and " did n't want to get caught "
he says he had inappropriate relationships with several women he 'd met online
