-- remember the @entity1 ? it was billed as a dream for @entity4 ; emigration slowed as tech giants like @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 set up manufacturing plants on the outskirts of @entity12			1
they were attracted by a young , well - educated @entity15 - speaking island in the heart of the euro zone			2
other foreign firms set up call centers and back office operations , attracted by a corporate tax rate at 10 % ( now 12.5 % )			1
@entity12 buzzed and property prices shot up			1
banks were encouraged to loan money to the fast growing building sector and everyone was flipping houses as prices soared			2
then it spread to the rest of the country as tax breaks led to housing estates being built in remote parts of the country , miles from services and jobs			2
these loans were then bundled up and used by the bankers and builders to invest in property overseas			0
we know what happened next			0
by november 2010 the government went cap - in - hand to @entity47 and the @entity48 for an 85 billion euro ( $ 117 billion ) bailout as the country took on all the debt of collapsing banks			1
with that came massive austerity ; about 20 % of the country 's gdp has painfully been cut -- through budget cuts such as social welfare reductions , pension freezes , tax rises			1
where is @entity62 now ? the answer lies in @entity12			2
as the city led the bust , it 's clear that the capital is leading the recovery on the back of social media			1
and i am promised it 's different this time			0
once empty buildings and warehouses in the @entity75 are filling up with the next generation of young well - educated @entity62 graduates working at the next generation of @entity80 tech names -- @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , trip advisor , @entity85			0
there are also @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity90 tech firms setting up here , attracted by the language skills they ca n't find at home			0
the cloud has come to @entity12 and is enveloping the silicon docks			2
there certainly is an argument that some of these firms are attracted by more than a multilingual young employment pool			0
even with a rock - bottom corporate tax rate , some of the firms use tax efficiencies to not even pay that on their @entity47 sales			0
but looking beyond that , having these firms growing in @entity12 has led to a score of much smaller , indigenous start - ups riding on the back of the bigger boys who set the tone			1
and they can be right next store thanks to plenty of cheap office space -- space none could have affording five years ago			0
this simply did not happen when the likes of @entity8 was assembling pcs on the outskirts			0
now , next to them are also the incubators , private equity firms , coffee shops and hip new hotels that all seem to be needed for this kind of area to thrive			0
so , where @entity132 and @entity133 have surely lost credibility in the eyes of the business community , @entity4 has actually gained traction			1
it 's benefited so much from the changes , that @entity140 just named @entity4 as the best place in the world to do business -- a first for @entity4			1
it may not sound ideal for employees , but @entity140 pointed out that real wages fell 17 % during the height of the crisis , and with unemployment near 13 % , there is a large pool of well - educated young people looking for work			1
add to that the controversial 12.5 % corporate tax rate , and @entity140 wrote " @entity4 still maintains an extremely pro-business environment			1
" what about the rest of the country ? the recovery is far from reaching everywhere			2
emigration from villages has soared as many small firms , built on the back of construction , collapsed			2
others that may have focused on exports - led industries that suffered when @entity47 and the @entity80 went through the economic crisis			0
social welfare payments have been slashed , and contributions to charities have been slashed too , seen as a " perfect storm " for the poor as one charity told me			0
of course the unemployment rate falls when people leave			0
charities say the long - term unemployed are n't about to get these social media jobs , nor even the ancillary jobs in the bars and hotels			1
so , the government is using groups like " @entity4 " to tempt more companies to the areas outside @entity12 and @entity188			1
but many mortgages are under water , house prices are only now beginning to go higher , and the government will continue to slash budgets in 2014			0
now it also has to attract investors to buy its bonds on the open market so the country can start to pay back that 85b euro loan			1
it has to achieve all this without a healthy bank sector and with unemployment still in double digits			0
look around @entity12 and you can see the change -- building cranes are popping up , shops and pubs are buzzing and traffic jams are back			1
it 's unlikely to spread to the rest of the country anytime soon , if ever , and it 's unlikely to ever be labeled the " @entity1 " again			2
shall we call it the @entity218 ?			0

in 2010 , @entity4 asked for an @entity221 euro bailout as it took on collapsed banks ' debts
massive austerity followed , with approximately 20 % of the country 's gdp cut
three years on , @entity140 has named @entity4 the best country to do business in
@entity233 says @entity12 is leading its recovery on the back of social media
