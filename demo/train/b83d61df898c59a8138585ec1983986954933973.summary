@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity1 ' olympic stadium suffered heavy damage during violent clashes between soccer fans and police , authorities said			1
the clashes left 20 police wounded , two seriously , police said			1
fifty - seven people were detained and another 23 arrested on charges of violence against police and possession of @entity18 cocktails			1
police said they were provoked by " a large group " throwing sticks , stones , bits of metal , @entity18 cocktails and flares			1
the clashes began two hours before a sunday night match between @entity0 's two main football clubs , @entity28 and @entity29 , was due to begin			1
" before the match , individuals who had already gained entry made a sortie from their stands , breaking stadium doors , attacking police and allowing others to enter without security checks , " a police statement said			1
one @entity28 fan who was present said that " there was a large group of fans that tried to get into the stadium through the basketball courts without tickets			1
" the match to got under way , but the violence resumed inside the stadium at half time , when dozens of @entity28 fans stormed police lines , authorities said			1
the second half of the match started almost an hour late , and was cut short by several minutes when fans started raining @entity18 cocktails on the stadium			1
they ripped up seats and partly burned one of the stadium 's two giant display boards			2
police later displayed pictures of seized @entity18 cocktails and flares			1
they also seized three , 16 - liter canisters of inflammable fluid that had been placed outside the stadium doors , presumably to resupply the troublemakers			2
the stadium is a symbol of a modern @entity0 moment of glory			2
it hosted track and field events during the highly successful @entity81			1
but it was never built to host soccer matches			0
it lacks turnstiles and heavy - duty security doors			0
cleanup crews were at work monday piling broken plastic chairs onto the brick - red rubber track and cleaning up debris with leaf blowers			2
the display board was visibly charred , and splotches of dried blood adorned the aisles			0
" when these groups can get away with such things , it is because they were able to get away with them in the past , with no one being punished , " public order minister @entity97 said on @entity98 , a local network			0
@entity28 issued a formal apology for the violent clashes , and could be fined			0
together with @entity29 , it forms @entity0 's football powerhouse			0
the two clubs are , with few exceptions , the only ones to represent @entity0 in @entity113 leagues ; but rivalry between their fans has plumbed such violent depths that the fans are no longer allowed to attend matches simultaneously , but are confined to home matches			0
" the violence may have been partly provoked by the heavy police presence , " one fan said			0
" there were seven busloads of police at the game			0
" but police may have arrived in such numbers anticipating an organized act of violence			0
" we knew it was going to happen , " said taxi driver @entity131 , a @entity28 follower			0
" one of the more extreme fan clubs was going to pay the police back for heavy - handed behavior during one of their basketball matches last week , " he said			0
@entity0 football teams do have official fan clubs , but the vast majority of fans belong to independently groups not controlled by the teams .			2
