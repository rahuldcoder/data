-- if the figures for childhood obesity in the @entity9 were not shocking enough -- prompting first lady @entity1 to set up a nationwide program to tackle the epidemic -- the statistics among the @entity6 community are yet more sobering			1
nearly 50 % of indigenous children are classed as obese , and on current projections they could be the first generation not to outlive their parents			0
urgent action is clearly needed and @entity1 has started her " @entity16 " initiative -- but help is also at hand from a former golfer who was once talked of in the same breath as his " dear friend " @entity22 and remains a hero in his @entity6 community			1
@entity25 is bringing the same competitive fervor which made him one of the sport 's hottest young prospects to a charitable foundation which focuses on tackling these health problems			1
" one in two @entity6 children expect to develop type 2 diabetes in their lifetime , so it is vital that effective strategies are available for all our communities , " @entity25 told @entity0			1
@entity25 , a roommate of @entity22 at @entity40 , won four @entity42 events before the age of 28 and achieved the " holy grail " of golf -- a round of 59 in a professional event			1
but a debilitating back injury put paid to his hopes of building on that early promise and he now devotes his time to his @entity53 foundation as well as working as a golf analyst for an @entity9 network			2
' generational trauma ' a @entity57 on his father 's side , while his mother is from the @entity61 , @entity25 is fiercely loyal to his upbringing and cultural identity			1
he is not afraid to speak out on equality issues -- he has gone on public record to criticize the @entity67 franchise @entity66 for its " offensive " name			0
@entity25 was alarmed by the team 's custom of having @entity71 dressed up in traditional clothing and regalia performing at games			1
it all touches a raw nerve for the 41 - year - old , who believes that what happened in the past -- and our society 's attitude to it -- is having a direct impact on today 's generation of @entity86 , with shocking consequences			0
" historically speaking , communities that have endured genocide suffer from generational trauma which leads to social issues , poor education , poor health outcomes , high crime and lots of addiction , " he said			2
" these are problems in the @entity6 community and we are at the very beginning of the fight			1
" his foundation was established in 2005 with the initial goal of introducing @entity6 youngsters from the greater @entity106 area to golf , in a program headed by his father , @entity25 other sports such as soccer were also introduced			1
but as the program expanded , the emphasis became those endemic health problems which blight his community			2
" something which started as simply golf and then soccer for kids is now an evidence based health and wellness program , " he said			2
funding the fight @entity25 's skills acquired as an economics major at @entity40 have been put to good use with the foundation			1
" i have tried to assign business principles to every aspect of our work , " he revealed			0
" we keep score and , if we are not hitting our targets , we change			0
i do n't see why non-profits should not be accountable for ever dollar invested			0
" to use a golf adage , we shoot for a 59 with some programs which carry a very high risk , but mix those with others where we know we are guaranteed a return on our investment			0
it 's a good mix. " @entity25 has used his contacts in golf , @entity22 included , to promote a yearly charity tournament , the @entity147 , which has raised over $ 4 million for the foundation			1
woods had to skip this year 's tournament at the @entity151 in @entity152 with a back injury , but spectators were treated to his replacement @entity156 , @entity25 , @entity157 and @entity158 beating an internationals team which included former masters champion @entity160 and former world no. 1 @entity161			2
for the flamboyant and crowd - pleasing @entity157 , the event and the cause has added significance as he is one - quarter @entity57			0
" his grandmother has become friends with my father because they are both of @entity57 descent , " @entity25 said			2
" i became aware of what @entity157 was doing from his high school days and he has brought a lot of flair to the game			0
" he is a very good - looking young man , with the colorful clothes , his unique swing , and he has created a lot of interest			0
" learning lessons for all his promise , @entity157 still has some way to match @entity25 's achievements , which as well as his @entity42 wins and the storied 59 in a @entity186 event , also included a place on the 2000 @entity189 team			1
but like his friend @entity22 , @entity25 has also made the headlines for the wrong reasons			1
in january 2000 , he was arrested for driving under the influence in @entity106 , his second offense of its type and sentenced to a year in jail , but with all but seven days suspended			0
@entity25 makes no attempt to duck his responsibilities -- raising the issue before being asked a direct question by @entity0			2
" i was aware there were certain expectations as a role model , and when you get arrested for drunk driving , i felt like i let down a lot of people , " he said			0
" but i learned from those mistakes and a lot of times failure is what drives you to success down the road			0
" i made a mistake , i served my time in jail and did n't try to sidestep it			0
" it is a measure of his determination that @entity25 went on to achieve two @entity42 wins later that year and make that @entity189 appearance , pairing with @entity22 as the @entity9 won against the international team			1
but sadly , it was to prove the peak of his career , which began as a three - time @entity227 at @entity40 with @entity22 , but petered out due to problems emanating from a herniated disc in his back			2
a number of comebacks and attempts to regain his full @entity42 card were ultimately frustrated and , having turned his talents to broadcasting , @entity25 gained a full - time position with @entity147 and the @entity238 earlier this year			1
" i play fine and take part in a couple of smaller events throughout the year , but playing 25 tournaments at the highest level each year is not possible , " he said			0
loyalty to his community and to his friends is a constant theme in @entity25 's life -- he stood by @entity22 when the 14 - time major champion was in self - imposed exile , with sponsors deserting him and supporters hard to find			1
@entity25 was there for @entity22 -- embracing him warmly -- when he made his february 2010 televised confession of extra marital affairs , and behind the microphone he has celebrated his return to the top of the world rankings three years later			1
@entity22 has returned that favor with his support for @entity53 , drawing the crowds in the 2012 tournament , which helped to place added focus on the foundation 's crucial work			1
it is now working with the @entity267 ( @entity267 ) , which provides for more than two million @entity86 , and the collaboration was developed in support of the initiative started by @entity1			0
her " let 's move in @entity272 " program seeks to improve the health of native youth through exercise			0
" this unprecedented partnership between the @entity1 administration , the @entity267 , and the @entity282 demonstrates the critical importance of leveraging partnerships and resources to tackle the health crisis facing @entity6 children , " @entity25 told his foundation 's website			1
so exciting times ahead for his program , but he is aware of the immense challenges it faces			0
" a lot of the tribal leaders are starting to support or work and acknowledge the dangers are young people are in , " @entity25 said			2
" it 's all about taking personal responsibility for your own life and to make something of yourself			0
" cracking the code @entity25 has lived up to those ideals with a strong work ethic in his family -- drilled into him by his father -- and backed up by no little flair through the generations			2
his grandfather , who died before he was born , was one of a select band of " @entity309 " recruited by the @entity9 military during @entity311 to use the @entity57 language as a basis for a secret communications code , which was never cracked by the @entity315 or the @entity316			0
thanks to his own hard work and talent , @entity25 was set firmly on the course to stardom from his college days			2
but if he does harbor any regrets about not being able to follow through on his early promise to win majors like @entity22 , @entity25 does not show it as he talks with passion about his foundation 's goals and hopes for the future			1
" i love this work , just as i loved trying to hit a ball onto the fairway , " he said .			0
