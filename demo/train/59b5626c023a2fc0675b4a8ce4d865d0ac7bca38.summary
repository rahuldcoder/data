-- the rapid thud - thud - thud of military choppers overhead on wednesday was the first thing to catch the attention of the residents of @entity6 , a city south of @entity7 known as a retreat for city - dwellers and tourists alike			1
the helicopters landed near @entity13 , a majestic resort where condos sell for millions of @entity16 pesos , and before long , seemingly hundreds of military personnel were on its grounds			2
a few hours later , a ferocious firefight broke out between the military and a cell of drug traffickers			2
" things like this rarely happen here , " said @entity23 , who works at a nearby private security firm			2
" i could hear the shots and the helicopters			2
it was a very ugly incident			0
" the outcome , however , was sweet for the administration of president @entity33			0
in a strong blow to one of @entity7 's most notorious drug cartels , @entity7 's navy killed @entity38 , head of the @entity40 cartel and one of @entity7 's three most wanted criminals			1
six other cartel members and one naval petty officer also died in the raid			1
three other people were arrested			0
the end of @entity40 's reign at the helm of the violent cartel was hailed by @entity7 and the @entity51 as a major victory for @entity33 's offensive against the cartels , a war that has claimed more than 14,000 lives since 2006			1
more than 7,300 people have been killed in drug - related violence this year , according to a tally by @entity7 's @entity61 newspaper			1
" this action represents a major achievement for the people and government of @entity7 , and is a decisive blow against one of the most dangerous criminal organizations in @entity7 , " @entity33 said , speaking from the @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64			1
the @entity72 said that its cooperation with @entity7 played a role in wednesday 's action			1
" [ @entity40 's ] death has dealt a crippling blow to one of the most violent cartels in the world , and it comes as a result of significant cooperation and information sharing between law enforcement in the @entity51 and our courageous partners in @entity7 , " @entity72 acting administrator @entity76 said in a written statement			1
video footage of the condo where @entity40 was staying revealed bullet - ridden walls			1
a plate of eggs and ham was set at the dinner table , which was adorned with two fruit bowls			0
a large baggie containing a white substance was nearby			0
on thursday , authorities presented to the media two women and a man who were arrested in the raid			1
their role with the cartel was not made clear			2
the women were identified as @entity107 and @entity108			0
the man 's name was not immediately released			2
it was believed that the raid was linked to another operation last week			2
on december 11 , the navy got into a firefight in @entity6 with gunmen of the @entity40 cartel			1
three of the gunmen were killed and 11 were arrested , according to the navy			0
@entity33 said wednesday 's operation " was the result of an intense intelligence effort by the @entity16 navy			2
" " we 've never seen anything like this , " @entity23 said			0
" the fear was palpable at a children 's hospital right behind the complex where the drug lord was killed			2
three military personnel posted themselves inside the hospital hours before the shooting started , saying only that they were in the middle of an operation , said dr. @entity138			0
the shooting started just after 8 p.m. and lasted for about an hour and a half , about 30 minutes of which were very intense , @entity138 said			0
" there was gunfire , machine gun fire and grenades , some of it very close to the hospital , " he said			0
" inside the hospital there was much stress , fear and anxiety			0
" three navy personnel were wounded by hand grenades , one fatally , the navy said			0
@entity160 3rd petty officer @entity159 died while being treated for his injuries , navy spokesman adm. @entity158 said			1

" it 's a battle won , but by no means the war , " said @entity166 , associate professor of political science at the @entity168			2
the death of the leader of a major drug cartel is a victory for the government , but it could also spur more violence , said @entity166 , an expert on drug trafficking in @entity7			1
for such a high - level blow by the military , reprisal killings by the cartel are a possibility , @entity166 said			2
violence could also flare from within the @entity40 organization itself , as its lieutenants jockey for position in the inevitable reorganization			1
finally , rivals -- and maybe even allies -- of the cartel may fight for a piece of the organization 's lucrative smuggling routes , @entity166 said			1
@entity40 and his organization rose in the @entity196 of @entity197 , home to a powerful cartel of the same name			1
@entity40 and his brothers initially were allied with the @entity199 , headed by @entity203 " @entity202			1
a series of disputes over the past years , however , led the @entity40 brothers to turn on @entity203 , or " shorty , " and they have been most recently linked with @entity208 , another violent cartel opposed to the @entity197 group			1
one of the @entity40 brothers , @entity210 , was arrested by @entity16 authorities last year and remains imprisoned			1
another brother , @entity212 , was indicted on drug trafficking charges out of @entity214 and @entity215			0
the slain brother , @entity216 , was also named in those indictments			0
the @entity40 cartel is known for air transportation expertise , @entity72 spokesman @entity218 said			1
an estimate from two years ago said the group smuggled 300 to 400 kilograms of cocaine monthly into the @entity51 , @entity218 said			0
the group is also known to smuggle black tar heroin			0
@entity225 : ride - along with anti-drug task force earlier this month , the @entity227 added @entity228 and other top cartel figures to a list of " specially designated narcotics traffickers , " a move that freezes any assets they have under @entity51 jurisdiction and prohibits people in the @entity51 from conducting business with them			2
@entity38 was already identified as a kingpin in may 2008			1
in the most recent addition , the @entity51 government named 22 members of the @entity40 organization and 10 related companies			1
since taking office , @entity33 has made fighting the drug cartels a priority			0
more than 40,000 troops have been deployed throughout the country to help small and often corrupt local forces			0
but it was the navy that made one of the biggest busts in the war on drugs			0
the reason may be because after years in the field , the army was not as reliable as a fresh force			0
" @entity33 has finally understood two things : that the army is susceptible to corruption , and that the army is not sufficient , " @entity166 said .			0

@entity38 was one of @entity7 's three most wanted criminals
@entity40 and his brothers rose in the @entity196 of @entity197
six other cartel members and one naval petty officer also died in the raid
