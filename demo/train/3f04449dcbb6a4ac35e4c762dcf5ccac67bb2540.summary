-- the @entity1 has denied that its agents required a 95 - year - old woman to remove her adult diaper last week before allowing her to pass a screening checkpoint at @entity6			1
" while every person and item must be screened before entering the secure boarding area , @entity1 works with passengers to resolve security alarms in a respectful and sensitive manner , " the agency said sunday night in a statement			1
" we have reviewed the circumstances involving this screening and determined that our officers acted professionally , according to proper procedure and did not require this passenger to remove an adult diaper			1
" a response released earlier sunday by the @entity1 said that the agency had reviewed the circumstances " and determined that our officers acted professionally and according to proper procedure			1
" the woman 's daughter , @entity26 , told @entity0 on monday that the @entity1 agents acted professionally and never ordered the removal of her mother 's diaper			1
however , @entity26 said the agents made it clear that her mother could not board the plane unless they were able to inspect the diaper			1
according to @entity26 , it was her idea to remove the diaper so it could be inspected and they could make their flight			2
" they were doing their job according to the instructions of the @entity1 and their policies , " @entity26 said , later adding that the options offered them were to remove the diaper or " she was not going to get on the plane			1
" on sunday , @entity26 told @entity0 that the june 18 incident occurred when she and her mother were traveling from northwest @entity50 to @entity51 , where her mother was planning to move in with other relatives prior to moving into an assisted - living facility			2
" my mother is very ill , she has a form of leukemia , " @entity26 said sunday			2
" she had a blood transfusion the week before , just to bolster up her strength for this travel			0
" at a security checkpoint , a @entity1 officer ushered the wheelchair - bound woman into a glassed - in area where a pat - down was performed , @entity26 said			1
@entity26 said an agent told her " they felt something suspicious on ( her mother 's ) leg and they could n't determine what it was " -- leading them to take her into a private , closed room			1
soon after , @entity26 said , a @entity1 agent told her that her mother 's @entity78 was " wet and it was firm , and they could n't check it thoroughly			1
" but her mother had no clean diapers in her carry - on luggage and the departure time for the plane was approaching , @entity26 said			0
" they said , ' you can get her luggage back to get more out of her luggage , ' but the luggage was checked and i did n't know how long it would take to get her luggage , " @entity26 said			0
" i asked if i could take the wet @entity78 off and they said yes but said i had to take her back to the lobby of the airport -- to the restroom out of the screening area			2
" she said she and her mother then went to a bathroom and removed the wet diaper , then went back through the screening checkpoint			1
@entity26 said her mother , a nurse for 65 years , " was very calm " despite being bothered by the fact that she went on to complete her journey without underwear			0
by this weekend , the elder woman -- who was not identified by name -- was doing " fine " in @entity51 with her relatives , @entity26 said sunday			0
this is not the first time that the @entity1 's pat - downs of passengers have come under fire , nor the first time that the agency has rallied behind its officers and policy			1
last year , the administration announced it was ramping up the use of full - body scanning and pat - downs to stop nonmetallic threats , including explosives , from getting on planes			0
the goal is to head off attacks such as the one allegedly attempted on christmas of 2009 by @entity127 , who allegedly had a bomb sewn into his underwear on a flight from the @entity131 to @entity51			0
the @entity1 estimates that only 3 % of passengers are subjected to pat - downs -- and then only after they have set off a metal detector or declined to step into a full - body scanner			2
yet the new policy has triggered an uproar online and in airports , from a small but vocal number of travelers who feel their rights and privacy were being violated			0
the federal safety agency has made some adjustments to its policy , but no major changes			0
" every traveler is a critical partner in @entity1 's efforts to keep our skies safe , " administrator @entity146 , who ordered the new approach , said last fall			1
" and i know and appreciate that the vast majority of @entity153 recognize and respect the important work we do			0
" more recently , outrage erupted over a video - recorded pat - down of a 6 - year - old passenger last april at @entity161 ' airport			0
the video , which was posted on @entity163 , shows the girl protesting the search by a female security officer at first , though she complies quietly while it is under way			0
@entity146 addressed this controversy at a @entity170 meeting last week , explaining the pat - down was ordered because the child had moved while passing through a body imaging machine			0
he told committee members that " we have changed the policy ( so ) that there 'll be repeated efforts made to resolve that without a pat - down			0
" the next day , @entity1 spokesman @entity181 said that the new policy -- which will apply to children age 12 and younger -- was in the process of being rolled out .			2
