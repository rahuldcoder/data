-- in her classic 1962 study , " @entity1 : warning and decision , " @entity4 shows how the @entity6 surprise attack on the @entity8 naval base on december 7 , 1941 , should have been less surprising than it appeared at the time because there were warning signs known to the @entity8 government that such an attack was possible			1
those warning signals , however , were not easy to understand before the @entity1 attack and , in any case , they were not well communicated inside the @entity8 military			1
as @entity4 explains , " it is much easier after the event to sort the relevant signals from the irrelevant signals			1
after the event , of course , a signal is always crystal clear ; we can now see what disaster it was signaling since the disaster has now occurred			0
but before the event it is obscure and pregnant with conflicting meanings			0
it comes to the observer embedded in an atmosphere of ' noise ' , i.e. in all sorts of information that is useless and irrelevant for predicting the disaster			1
" while the bombings at the @entity42 certainly were not anywhere on the scale of the @entity1 attack , they share some of the commonalities that often characterize the run - up to such surprising attacks : missed warning signals and the bureaucratic " stove piping " of important information that if it was more widely shared and understood might have led to the attacks being averted			1
as is now well known , the @entity53 security agency @entity52 told the @entity54 in 2010 that @entity55 , the older alleged @entity57 bomber , was becoming radicalized			0
the @entity54 investigated him but found nothing " derogatory			0
" yet , the @entity54 was unaware that a year after its investigation @entity55 returned from a trip to @entity62 and @entity63 in southern @entity53 -- regions that are home to @entity66 militantsâ € ” after a six month trip , one that could have raised red flags , as by now he was on two federal watch lists			0
( it 's also not clear why the @entity53 would warn the @entity54 about @entity55 's radical interests and then , apparently , not have done more to keep tabs on him while he was on his lengthy trip to @entity53			2
) a @entity77 official on the @entity54 's @entity57 joint terrorism task force was made aware of @entity55 's return but because the @entity54 had closed its investigation into @entity55 , the information failed to arouse suspicion			1
according to a report on @entity0 tuesday , @entity81 sen. @entity81 expressed concern that " the homeland security shop had information about the travel to @entity53 , the @entity54 did not , and they 're not talking to each other and they 're going back to the pre- 9/11 problems here			1
" indeed , these kind of bureaucratic snafus were supposed to have been resolved after 9/11			2
that 's because while the @entity93 provided plenty of strategic warnings in the spring and summer of 2001 that @entity96 was planning a spectacular attack , the @entity93 also spectacularly dropped the ball in the run - up to 9/11 when it failed to " watch list " two suspected men that @entity93 officials suspected were members of @entity96 , @entity103 and @entity104			1
the failure to add to the watch list two @entity96 suspects with the @entity108 meant that they entered the @entity8 under their true names with ease			0
on january 15 , 2000 , @entity103 and @entity104 flew into @entity111 , but it was only in august 2001 as a result of questions raised by a @entity93 officer on assignment at the @entity54 that the two were added to the watch list and their names communicated to the @entity54			0
a month later @entity120 and @entity104 were two of the " muscle " hijackers on the @entity123 jet that plunged into the @entity124 , killing 189 people			0
there have been many fixes since 9/11 to ameliorate the problem of bureaucratic stove piping : far more communication , for instance , between the @entity93 and the @entity54 ; the formation of dozens of @entity134 across the country that help to facilitate the sharing of information among multiple law enforcement agencies , as well as the creation of the @entity140 , which coordinates terrorism policy across the intelligence and law enforcement communities			1
but even with all of these reforms the counterterrorism system continues to miss the kind of warning signs that take on great significance in the wake of an attack			1
consider the case of maj. @entity152 , a military psychiatrist who killed 13 people at @entity154 , @entity155 , in 2009			2
before this attack , intelligence agencies had intercepted multiple e-mails between @entity152 and @entity159 , a @entity8 - born cleric then based in @entity160 who was well known for his virulent @entity162 preaching and ties to militants			2
counterterrorism investigators did n't pursue this worrisome connection believing that the e-mails were consistent with @entity152 's work as a military psychiatrist			2
similarly , @entity169 , a convert to @entity170 who shot up a @entity174 , @entity175 , recruiting office in 2009 , fatally shooting a soldier , had recently travelled to @entity160 and was under investigation by the @entity54 following his return to the @entity8			0
despite the fact that the @entity54 had had him under surveillance , @entity178 was still able to acquire guns for his attack			2
when he was arrested , police found a rifle with a laser sight , a revolver , ammunition and material to make @entity190 cocktails in his vehicle			0
plenty of warning signs also preceded @entity197 @entity196 's attempt to blow up @entity199 flight 253 over @entity200 on christmas day 2009 with an underwear bomb made with @entity202 , a plastic explosive that was not detected by airport security			1
luckily the bomb failed to detonate , although it set @entity196 's clothes on fire			0
@entity196 had been recruited by @entity207 ( @entity207 ) for the @entity200 mission			0
the @entity199 plot had been presaged a few months earlier			0
on august 28 , 2009 , the @entity211 prince @entity210 survived a bombing attack launched by @entity207			0
the would - be assassin concealed the bomb in his underwear , which was made of @entity202			0
three months before the @entity216 attempted bombing @entity217 , @entity219 's top counterterrorism adviser , had been personally briefed by @entity220 about the assassination attempt , so information about the possible use of a hard - to - detect @entity202 bomb was known within the @entity8 national security establishment			2
the @entity227 's review of the @entity216 plot also found that there was sufficient information known to the @entity8 government to determine that @entity196 was likely working for @entity96 and that the group was looking to expand its attacks beyond @entity160 and @entity211			1
yet the intelligence community " did not increase analytic resources working " on the threat that the group might pose to the @entity237			0
additionally , a few weeks before the botched attack on the @entity199 flight , @entity196 's father contacted the @entity242 in @entity197 about concerns his son had " become radicalized " and might be planning something , but this information was n't further investigated			1
as the inevitable congressional inquiries get under way that will focus on who knew what and when about the @entity57 bombers , we will surely deepen our understanding that there were plenty of warning signs about the increasing radicalization of @entity55 , some of which were likely known to the @entity8 government			1
the problem is that , as @entity4 pointed out half a century ago in her study of @entity1 , separating out the really important signals from all the " noise " in the system is only easy to do after the fact , particularly when the @entity8 government has now assembled a database of an astonishing number of 700,000 individuals it suspects of ties to terrorism .			1

@entity274 : too often the warning signs of terrorism are missed
he says before an attack , it 's difficult to sort out the signals from the noise
agencies often will fail to widely communicate information in time to prevent attacks , he says
@entity288 : such failures became apparent after 9/11 attacks , @entity154 shootings
