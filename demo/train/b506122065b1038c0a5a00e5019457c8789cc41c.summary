-- defending champions @entity1 regained control of their qualifying destiny for the @entity5 in @entity6 when beating @entity7 1 - 0 in a crucial encounter in @entity9			1
a home win in the @entity7 , where @entity7 lifted the @entity12 , would have given coach @entity14 ' side a five - point margin with just three qualifiers remaining			1
such a scenario would have potentially banished @entity1 to the ignominy of having to qualify for @entity6 via the playoffs but now it is their vanquished foes who appear set for such a fate			0
in a tight encounter , both sides wasted fine openings -- with @entity27 at fault for the hosts while @entity30 was unusually wayward for the visitors -- before @entity32 bundled home after 58 minutes			0
the victory takes @entity1 to 11 points in @entity36 , one more than @entity7 , with the other teams in the group -- @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 -- seemingly out of contention			1
" i am happy because the three points put us in a good situation , but also because we stuck to our style , " said @entity1 coach @entity43			0
" we could have won by a greater margin in the end			0
" only one team automatically qualifies for the @entity12 from each of the nine @entity53 groups , with the eight best runners - up going into a playoff in november			0
the defeat was the first in a competitive match as @entity60 coach for @entity14 , who saw young @entity62 midfielder @entity61 sent off for two yellow cards			0
like the @entity60 , @entity65 's @entity64 also had to settle for second place on an evening when plans for group supremacy were ripped up			2
the @entity69 had been looking to inflict a first @entity71 defeat for leaders @entity73 , a country of little more than 600,000 inhabitants , but the @entity77 nation retained their two - point lead over the visitors when drawing 1 - 1			1
@entity80 , who was sent off on his last visit to @entity82 , thought he had atoned when heading the 1966 world champions into an early lead only for the hosts to dominate the second half and deservedly equalize through @entity87			1
" we 're still confident we can finish top of the group , " said @entity64 captain @entity88 , whose side could be five points adrift before they host @entity91 in september			2
group rivals @entity95 and @entity96 , who co-hosted the 2012 @entity98 , also won , beating @entity99 and @entity91 respectively , to close the gap on the @entity71 leaders			0
elsewhere , @entity102 -- the only country to have played @entity5 qualifiers in five different continents -- boosted their chances of returning to the finals for the first time since 1970 when winning 2 - 0 in @entity108			2
the victory takes them to 11 points , level with a @entity114 side who beat 10 - man @entity117 2 - 0 in @entity118 , as both sides battle for second place behind @entity122 's @entity121 , who lead the group with 12 points having played two games less			1
@entity121 , who drew 1 - 1 with @entity6 in a friendly on monday night in @entity129 , are one of only two @entity53 sides to boast 100 % records , with @entity133 maintaining theirs on tuesday as the @entity136 leaders thumped @entity137 4 - 0 at home to earn their sixth straight win			1
group rivals @entity141 , who finished third at the 2002 @entity12 , endured a disappointing night as they were held to a 1 - 1 draw at home by a resurgent @entity146 , with a team that reached the 1954 @entity12 final continuing to suggest signs of a long - overdue revival			1
having gifted the visitors their equalizer , the @entity150 trail the @entity153 by 11 points with only four qualifiers left			0
between them , @entity156 and @entity157 have won the @entity12 on seven occasions -- and both maintained control of their groups with comfortable victories on tuesday			0
@entity163 continued his recent hot streak by scoring both goals in a 2 - 0 win in @entity167 , to keep @entity157 -- who have a game in hand -- three points clear of second - placed @entity173 side @entity172			1
the @entity174 -- who lead @entity176 by eight points -- defeated @entity178 4 - 1 but the visitors had a moment to savour when @entity181 found the back of the net after 46 minutes , only the @entity178 ' second goal from their six qualifiers			2
one of the most intriguing battles for automatic @entity5 qualification comes in @entity188 where both @entity189 and @entity190 are tied on 16 points apiece , after their first six matches			2
heralding a special group of players including @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 among others , the @entity193 beat @entity201 1 - 0 at home as @entity204 midfielder hazard settled the contest shortly after the hour			1
the goal looked as if it could be decisive as @entity190 trailed to an early @entity208 penalty in @entity209 with thirteen minutes left , before goals from @entity211 and @entity212 turned the @entity214 clash around and ensured @entity188 is likely to go all the way to the wire .			0

world champions @entity1 beat @entity7 1 - 0 in @entity9 to regain group i control
@entity64 are held 1 - 1 in @entity73 as the @entity77 nation maintain grip on @entity71
@entity189 and @entity190 both win to maintain *thrilling* group a battle
