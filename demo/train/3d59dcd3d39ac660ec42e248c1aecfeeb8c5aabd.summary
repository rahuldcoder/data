@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 is one of those great @entity5 states that is simply beyond belief for many of us : it is too big , too bold , too sprawling , too brawling for many folks east of the @entity11 to fully grasp			1
and yet , its very " otherness " makes it the perfect place to begin our grand journey to find out how our fellow citizens are " @entity16			2
" for each of the next seven months , we are going to roam the @entity22 countryside in the @entity24 bus asking people , communities and businesses how they 're finding ways to succeed despite the hard times we are all facing			1
we will share what we find here and on @entity2 programs like " @entity33 , " " @entity34 , " and " ac360 Â°			1
" one thing i know already from a lifetime of traveling over and over again to all 50 states : @entity22 is filled with independent , hard - working , innovative souls who find ways to succeed even when success seems unreachable			1
there may be no state with a deeper streak of that independence than this one , which was once a nation			2
in the @entity0 , we found people with big smiles , determination , enormous pride in their home and their country			1
i suspect i 'll find very much the same elsewhere on our journey , despite the economic slump that has hit everyone so hard			2
@entity58 is one person we found			2
she 's the owner , chief executive , forklift driver and all - around hand at the @entity62			0
five years ago , her business burned to the ground			0
and with the construction business soon to head into a steep decline , she could easily have been forced into an early retirement , or at least an entirely different trade			0
but @entity58 never considered it			0
she rallied her friends and family , scraped up money and moxie , and the first business day after the fire , with little more than a working phone , she sold a load of plywood			0
since then , she 's rebuilt , rewritten her business plan and shifted heavily to green and sustainable building materials to capitalize on changes in the marketplace			0
she 's the first to say that " @entity16 " means constantly evolving and innovating			0
that is just one of the success stories we 've seen up close during our visit to @entity0			1
some economic analysts predict that the area between @entity1 and @entity91 will lead the way for much of the nation as the economy slowly recovers			1
we 'll also spend a lot time just traveling around and listening to ordinary citizens : blue - collar laborers and white - collar business folk ; farmers and field hands ; musicians , housewives , students and more			0
the simple truth is , the real secret to any hope we have for a recovery lies out there , not inside the @entity108 in @entity109 it rests with all sort of normal people who , despite the downturn , have never stopped " @entity16 " and have a lot of lessons to share with all the rest of us			1
and if you see me on the trail , flag me down to say hello .			0

@entity24 bus tells stories of people who evolve and innovate amid hard times
@entity22 is filled with workers who find ways to succeed and have lessons to share
