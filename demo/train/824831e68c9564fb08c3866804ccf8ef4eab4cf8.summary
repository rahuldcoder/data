-- with the @entity2 this weekend , it 's time for the predictions			2
who will defend their crown ? who will take home a statuette for the first time ? who should win ? and who will win ? here are our prognostications			2
tell us yours in the comments section below			0
outstanding drama series although " @entity22 " has the most victories in the drama series category and " @entity21 " leads with 16 nominations , neither of these two shows is a sure thing			0
( " @entity22 " was shut out last year , and if the @entity25 this year are any indication , " @entity21 " wo n't sweep )			2
the real race is between defending champion " homeland , " which won last year for its freshman season , and " @entity36 , " which has better odds to triumph given that the critically acclaimed show 's fifth season is its last			1
as a four - time nominee , voters might feel like giving " @entity36 " a hug goodbye , so the show will likely win			1
photos : ' @entity36 's ' most memorable scenes but as far as creative ambition and strength of storytelling , the epic " @entity21 " pulls off the bigger feat and should win			1
( unfortunately , historically emmy voters tend not to favor fantasy shows , save for " @entity50 " before its supernatural elements became prominent )			2
outstanding comedy series a sentimental choice might also rule the comedy series category			2
just as " @entity36 " is the favorite to win the drama race in its last season , so could " @entity59 " take the comedy crown			1
if @entity60 could predict the @entity2 winners ... however , " @entity59 " has won three times ( 2007 , 2008 and 2009 ) , so it does n't provide the same element of righting a wrong to give it one last @entity2 , and the show has been shut out ever since " @entity68 " stole its winning streak			1
last season of " @entity68 , " however , was n't a laugh riot , and voter fatigue could be an issue here -- how many times can this show continue to win ? a newcomer to the ballot , " @entity85 " has a singular vision and has influenced other shows in its category ( i.e. " girls " ) , which might help break the comedy category from the ensemble - oriented tunnel vision			1
unlike " girls , " " @entity85 " does n't have a backlash problem -- and the show has nods for writing , directing , acting and editing , a total package			2
" @entity68 " might win again , " @entity59 " might even get some love , but " @entity85 " should score			1
photos : what we 'll miss most from ' @entity59 ' outstanding tv movie / miniseries " @entity109 " was a clear favorite in the tv movie / miniseries category last year , and this year , it 's @entity102 's " @entity108 , " starring @entity103 as @entity104 and @entity105 as his lover , @entity106 , with 15 nominations			0
photos : ' @entity108 ' " @entity113 " will dominate , but would it be crazy if " @entity112 : asylum " took the prize ? with 17 nominations and the most out - there topics -- @entity120 experiments , demonic possessions , alien abductions and serial killers -- the show still managed to be as poignant as it was camp			1
no easy feat. outstanding lead actor in a comedy series of course , all of these shows depend on the strength of their actors			0
stand - up comics , however , rarely win acting @entity25 , but this might be the year that changes that trend , if @entity137 can take home an award			1
( he looks poised to do so , after his recent win at the @entity141 and @entity142 )			0
coming up on his heels are last year 's winner , @entity145 , for " @entity146 , " crowd favorite @entity147 for " @entity148 , " @entity149 , who took home the @entity2 in 2008 and 2009 but is on his last chance for " @entity59 , " and @entity152 , the sole nominee from " @entity153			0
" @entity145 did n't submit a showcase episode , so there 's room for an upset here			0
@entity137 can and should win			1
outstanding lead actress in a comedy series as for comedy actresses , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 have all won emmys for their respective roles on " @entity59 , " " @entity166 " and " @entity167			1
" @entity160 might get the sentimental vote for being the show 's creator and the show having its last season , but it 's also time for her pal @entity173 to get a win for " @entity175			1
" ( and if either one wins , they could do a speech together ! hilarity would ensue			0
) outstanding leads in a drama series in the @entity2 race for drama actor and actress , " homeland " hopes for a repeat of its sweep			0
this year , @entity189 is the only former @entity2 winner in her field , which includes @entity191 ( " @entity22 " ) , @entity192 ( " @entity193 " ) , @entity194 ( " @entity195 " ) , @entity196 ( " scandal " ) and @entity198 ( " @entity199 " )			0
while @entity200 has the more flamboyant role , she has a rival in @entity203 , who is also a favorite and might become the first @entity207 - @entity206 actress to win best actress in this category			1
@entity196 : @entity25 ' it girl ' but previous @entity213 nominee @entity194 should win			0
as the mother of a teenage @entity216 , she plays a role that is at turns neurotic , obsessive and sympathetic , creating a character who might be even more dangerous in some ways than her serial killer son			0
( @entity223 would be shut out -- again -- she 's really more deserving for best actress for her movie / miniseries " @entity227 , " even if @entity228 is the favorite in that category )			0
@entity231 : @entity25 man of the moment meanwhile , @entity231 lost out to @entity234 last year , but @entity235 is the favorite to win this year , what with the series finale of " @entity36 " airing just a week after the @entity25			1
if @entity231 wins , this would be his fourth @entity2 , and he would tie with " @entity241 " star @entity240 for most wins in this category			0
even though his competition includes two - time oscar winner @entity246 for " @entity199 " and always - a - nominee , never - a - winner @entity244 for " @entity22 , " @entity231 will and should win			2
say his name , emmy voters !			0

how will " @entity36 " fare as it wraps up its final season ?
can " @entity68 " maintain its comedy streak ?
will stand - up comic @entity137 *nab* an emmy this year ?
pals @entity160 and @entity260 are both nominated -- will either win ?
