-- in the midst of the contentious debate over the @entity4 , many critics have lost perspective on its purpose			1
why did so many governors , educators and policymakers across both parties join together to create the standards in the first place ? a brief look at @entity4 's history would help explain its significance and counter some of the criticisms			1
in 1983 , then secretary of education @entity17 commissioned the seminal report , " @entity20 , " which highlighted @entity23 students ' falling sat scores and awakened the nation to its educational malaise			1
among many of the report 's recommendations , which eventually became a platform for modern education reforms , were calls for " more rigorous and measurable standards			2
" @entity23 students were victims of low expectations and inconsistent learning goals			1
but despite the report 's warnings and billions of dollars more spent on education , not much has changed			0
thanks to benchmarked national and international exams , like the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) or @entity43 ( @entity43 ) , we know that @entity23 students continue to fall short			1
( there 's one sliver of good news : for a number of reasons there have been dramatic improvements in some individual states like @entity52			0
) these exams highlighted how the performance of @entity23 students differed widely between states and districts			1
some states had high internationally competitive standards ; others were far too low			0
in fact , some states were dumbing down standards and exams in order to hide the poor performance of their students			2
for example , @entity67 rated 87 % of its fourth graders proficient in math , according to its own state testing in 2009			0
that would be astounding -- if true			0
but @entity42 results calculated that only 40 % of the state 's fourth graders were proficient or better in math. educational performance in many districts and states resembled @entity80 -- the fictional place in @entity83 's " @entity82 " where " all the women are strong , all the men are good looking , and all the children are above average			0
" but reality is different			0
local control has always been an essential right of education in @entity23 , but there was a growing problem : when different states with different standards and different tests proliferated , we ended up with unreliable measures of how our children are really doing			1
a wide and disparate variety of education standards promotes chaos and deception			0
realizing this , in 2009 , a collaborative involving the @entity105 and @entity106 began to discuss the need for common standards and accountability			1
the end goal is that an " a " in math in @entity115 should be equivalent to an " a " in math in @entity112 , or in @entity113 , and so on			0
so began the coordinated effort from governors , educators and legislators to compose benchmarked standards that would be the same across state lines			0
the product became the @entity4			2
its genesis was local and its purpose was to lift education performance through state , not federal , collaboration			1
this was the original intent of the @entity4			2
it is a worthy and necessary idea			0
unfortunately , outside forces have interfered with or distorted the idea , obscuring its real merits			0
federal intrusions such as the @entity135 grants have not been helpful			0
@entity4 is n't without its problems , but some of have been exaggerated and some have been made up out of thin air			2
we ca n't lose sight of the original intent			0
should @entity4 fail , the movement -- decades in the making -- toward rigorous , common standards would be dealt a serious blow			1
while various questions about @entity4 and its implementation persist , such as how to handle data privacy or concerns that some of the standards may not be rigorous enough , individual states have the right and ability to craft their own supplemental solutions			2
for example , this year @entity157 passed @entity159 487 to protect the confidentiality of student data and @entity162 altered its @entity4 standards to include more advanced calculus standards			2
some of the criticisms leveled against @entity4 stem from mistakes made in local implementations -- not from a uniform federal mandate			1
it is ironic that the very thing which many of @entity4 's critics value the most -- local control -- has often resulted in curricula , subject matter , readings , and exercises in local classrooms that are objectionable , substandard , or politically tendentious			1
if @entity4 fails , education reform will regress and @entity23 students ' flat or falling test results in learning will continue			1
it must be noted that many of @entity4 's critics still lack a persuasive alternative or any alternative at all .			1

@entity186 : critics of @entity4 have lost perspective of its purpose
@entity186 : the problem is how to address @entity23 students ' flat or falling test scores
he says lack of common standards means inconsistent and unreliable learning results
@entity186 : some of its problems stem from local implementations , not federal mandate
