-- a little over ten years ago the coral reefs of @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity4 , were in a state of terminal decay			1
fishing with dynamite and cyanide , untreated sewage and rising water temperatures had all pushed the reefs , and life they supported , close to the limit			0
" tourist numbers fell due to destruction of dive and snorkeling sites ( while ) fishermen had to go further and fish longer for less catch			0
hunger was a real threat , " says @entity20 , project manager of the @entity22 project			0
the fact that the reef also acted as a natural flood barrier increased the town 's exposure to coastal erosion from rising sea levels , he adds			0
today however , @entity2 's coral reefs are once again teeming with life thanks to @entity34 -- an electrically - powered coral reef growing scheme			1
@entity37 is placed on underwater electrified steel frames that are connected to a power source on land			1
the electrification speeds up a process called " mineral accretion " that helps damaged corals grow and repair themselves			0
" living corals are carefully collected and transplanted onto the structures by attaching with wires or wedged between ( electric ) steel bars , " says @entity20 the project has been so successful that not only has it preserved the reef and surrounding marine ecosystem but it has also become a tourist attraction in its own right , says @entity20			2
despite the success of the @entity2 project , @entity34 technology -- first discovered by @entity58 - born architect , @entity57 , in the 1970s -- is it still only used on a small scale			1
although now present in over 20 countries , the largest @entity34 scheme is in @entity2 and only covers around 500 meters			2
this constitutes a drop in the ocean when compared to the 109,800 square miles of coral reef that the @entity67 estimates to exist , 75 % of which is believed to be under threat according to the @entity70			0
read more about the threat to coral reef diversity but according to @entity73 , head of the @entity75 based non-profit , the @entity74 , @entity34 is more efficient than any other form of reef regeneration and will become a particularly effective defense against rising sea levels in years to come			2
" we have to run cables out into the sea and you can only go so far before you lose a lot of power , " says @entity73 who works to encourage the implementation of @entity34 technology in vulnerable ecosystems			1
the cables dictates how far out at sea the steel frames can be placed ( only a few hundred meters ) and therefore limits the area of coral reef that can be grown or repaired as the technology develops though , @entity73 sees no reason why @entity34 structures could n't stretch across hundreds of miles of shoreline or far out into the oceans , protecting vast coastal areas that are exposed to rising sea levels			1
the key to this prospect becoming a reality , he says , is the harnessing of renewable sources such as tidal and wave energy			1
" there is a vast amount of energy in the ocean			0
it 's untapped and what it will allow us to do is generate our power on site , " says @entity73			0
" this renewably powered technology is still in the pioneering stage but it will be far cheaper and far more effective when it becomes available			2

coral reefs in @entity4 are being *regrown* on electrically powered steel frames
the technology , known as @entity34 , has helped maintain *delicate* marine ecosystems
@entity34 could soon be powered by renewable energy sources such as wave and solar power
