the @entity1 administration has confirmed what we have been hearing for months , that chemical weapons have been used in @entity5 by the regime of embattled president @entity7			1
the news , revealed in a @entity10 letter to @entity11 , presents president @entity1 with a stark question			2
will the @entity13 become directly involved in the two - year - old @entity5 civil war ? last august , @entity1 issued a stern warning to @entity7			1
if he used chemical weapons , @entity1 said , even if he moved them in preparation for use , he would cross a " red line " that would have " enormous consequences			1
" before that , @entity1 had already declared that the regime would be " held accountable " if it made the " tragic mistake of using those weapons , " a warning he repeated last month during a trip to the @entity28			1
@entity1 has now come up against his own words and the stakes are enormous			2
the @entity13 has a range of options , including several that do not include sending @entity13 forces into @entity5			1
one path is to provide more muscular support to certain rebel units			0
the administration has been reluctant to arm the rebels because @entity41 radicals , including some closely affiliated with @entity42 , have become an important part of the @entity45 forces			1
this is problematic , since @entity47 has called for an end to the @entity7 regime , a regime that , incidentally , is closely allied with @entity50 and @entity51			0
but it is possible to discern the members whose ideology is relatively consistent with @entity13 values and policies			1
those fighters should receive carefully selected weaponry to raise their effectiveness against @entity7 and increase their appeal within the opposition			0
in addition to helping arm them , the @entity13 should look into the possibility of creating safe havens , no - fly zones , where the opposition and civilians might be protected by @entity69 from @entity5 air attacks			1
there is also the option of destroying @entity7 's most dangerous weapons stocks through aerial bombardment			1
although , depending on the target , bombing could carry the risk of spreading the contents , and in the end , the @entity13 may need to remove the stockpiles by designating allies to enter the facilities that hold them			2
any action should be taken , to the extent possible , under the @entity69 umbrella			0
the one course of action @entity47 can not afford is to ignore its own warnings and the @entity13 intelligence community 's conclusions			2
doing so would legitimize the use of chemical weapons , letting regimes that hold power by force know that they can use the world 's most reviled weaponry to preserve their rule from internal challenges			1
failure to act could hasten a grave escalation in a war that has put the entire @entity28 on a knife 's edge			2
it would threaten to spread its destructiveness beyond @entity5 borders and raise the incentive for other militias to start using chemical agents , potentially fueling a market among terrorist groups everywhere			2
and it would make the dire warnings of an @entity13 president ring hollow , with damaging consequences for global stability , not to mention for @entity13 security			0
among those watching , @entity50 would certainly draw its own conclusions if the @entity13 ignores its own red line			1
until now , the @entity1 administration has resisted pressure to take a tougher stance against @entity7 if only to stem the killing			1
more than 70,000 @entity5 have already died and millions have fled the fighting			0
refugee pressures are building in neighboring states , and the conflict has already drawn fighters from other countries ; among others , @entity51 militias from @entity137 , which have joined the war on @entity7 's side			0
for almost two years the president opted to limit @entity13 involvement , reportedly rejecting proposals from former secretary of state @entity143 and former @entity145 chief @entity144 to arm carefully selected segments of the opposition			0
at the same time , @entity13 has provided generous help for refugee care , along with nonlethal aid to the rebels			2
the use of chemical weapons , however , is a game changer			1
the beleaguered @entity7 has admitted possessing an enormous chemical arsenal			0
@entity5 holds stockpiles that experts say include @entity158 , @entity159 and mustard gas			0
production facilities and warehouses for them are spread throughout the country			0
regional analysts believe that @entity7 has thousands of rockets filled with nerve agents ready for use with the @entity5 army 's vast missile systems			2
@entity13 officials say there 's much they do n't know yet about how the weapons have been used			1
secretary of defense @entity174 said on thursday that within the last 24 hours @entity13 intelligence officials concluded the @entity5 government forces used a small amount of an agent , probably @entity158			1
the use of those " uncontrollable , deadly weapons , " @entity184 said , " violates every convention of warfare			0
" charges that @entity7 's forces used chemical weapons surfaced months ago , but it was a march 19 attack in @entity188 that drew global attention			1
in the face of mounting evidence of people with respiratory distress , burns and other signs of unconventional weapons use in a battle zone , the rebels accused @entity7 and @entity7 accused the rebels of using chemical agents			2
the @entity5 government called for a @entity203 probe , but then refused to allow the investigation			0
more recently , @entity205 , the @entity206 and @entity207 have said they have found evidence of chemical weapons use			1
on wednesday , @entity207 's head of military intelligence said @entity207 has gathered evidence , including photographs of areas with people with mouths foaming following an attack			0
he said he believes @entity7 has used the weapons several times , including on march 19			0
it is likely that @entity7 is testing international reaction by using limited amounts of banned weapons			0
if reaction does not follow , he will probably use them more extensively			0
the @entity13 has deployed a few hundred troops to @entity227 , just south of @entity5 , with the purpose of aiding refugee care and , according to a @entity231 report , as " the vanguard of a potential military force of 20,000 or more " in case the @entity13 decides to move to secure @entity5 's chemical weapons			1
the @entity13 and the world have many options on the table , none of them risk free			0
but the riskiest of all would be delaying a meaningful and forceful response .			0

@entity244 : @entity1 administration confirmed @entity5 regime used chemical weapons
@entity249 : this crosses @entity1 's " red line ; " will he act ? possible to do so without @entity13 forces
she says arming rebels with values similar to @entity13 one option ; another is no - fly zones
@entity249 : not acting would legitimize use of chemical weapons , upend @entity13 *authority*
