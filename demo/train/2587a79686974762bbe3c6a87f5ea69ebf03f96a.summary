@entity0 , @entity1 -- after disrupting a national election , anti-government demonstrators in @entity1 have vowed to keep up their campaign against prime minister @entity6			1
the troubled election sunday , which was boycotted by the main opposition party , appears unlikely to resolve @entity1 's protracted political crisis , which has fueled bouts of deadly unrest in the @entity13 country			1
during the tense election process , anti-government protesters stopped candidates from registering , blocked delivery of ballot boxes and prevented people from casting their votes			1
as a result , voting was disrupted in 69 out of the country 's 375 electoral districts , authorities said			1
the demonstrators have been protesting since november , saying they want to rid @entity1 of the influence of @entity6 and her older brother , former prime minister @entity29 , who now lives in exile			2
protest leaders are demanding that an unelected " people 's council " be given the power to carry out political and electoral changes in a country where parties affiliated with @entity29 have dominated elections since 2001			0
disrupted election @entity6 has insisted that an election is the only legitimate way forward for @entity1 , which has been repeatedly wracked by political conflicts over the past eight years			1
her party is expected to win this vote comfortable , especially as the opposition @entity45 refused to participate			2
an estimated 45.84 % of voters participated in the election , the @entity46 said monday , a far lower turnout than the 75 % in the 2011 vote that brought @entity6 to power			1
election results are yet to be announced , but since voting was disrupted in so many districts , the vote appears unlikely to produce enough valid results to form a parliament , meaning @entity6 will remain as caretaker prime minister			1
the @entity59 says holding by - elections in all the disrupted districts -- a process likely to face further pressure from protesters -- could take as long as six months			1
but deputy prime minister @entity65 said monday that the commission is required under the constitution to organize enough by - elections to reopen parliament within 30 days of sunday 's vote			2
the opposition , meanwhile , is mounting a legal challenge to the election 's legitimacy			0
last week , an attorney for the @entity45 filed a petition asking the nation 's constitutional court to declare sunday 's election invalid because of the disruptions to voting			2
protesters resolute the outlook for @entity1 appears to be more uncertainty and unrest			1
since november , at least 10 people have died and nearly 600 have been wounded in violence linked to tensions around the protests			0
the conflict has deepened the country 's political divide			0
the anti-government movement draws it support from southern @entity1 , @entity0 's middle class and the established elites			1
@entity6 's base is in the less affluent but more populous regions north and east of the capital			0
in @entity102 , a @entity0 district of mixed pro- and anti-government sentiment , gunfire erupted saturday between masked men amid demonstrations against the elections , witnesses said			1
health officials reported at least eight people wounded since saturday			0
protest leader @entity108 on sunday sought to distance his movement from the violence			0
" we need to keep our principles			0
we fight in peace , with no weapons and violence			0
we only fight with our feet and whistles , " he said			0
" we have the right to a peaceful protest			0
" @entity108 said his supporters would continue efforts this week to block government offices in @entity0			2
they held a march in the center of @entity0 on monday			2
lt. gen. @entity126 , the national security chief , estimated that there were between 2,000 and 3,000 demonstrators on the city 's streets monday			0
protesters generally dispute authorities ' estimates of their numbers , claiming they are far higher			2
amid the political deadlock , some observers have suggested @entity1 's powerful military , which has carried out coups in the past , could step in			1
the military 's stance on the crisis remains unclear			0
the @entity144 government is opposed to a coup , the @entity142 said monday			1
" we are speaking directly to all elements of @entity1 society to make clear the importance of using democratic and constitutional means to resolve political differences , " @entity146 , a @entity142 spokeswoman , said at a regular news briefing			2
voters determined despite the tensions in @entity0 over the weekend , many voters insisted on casting their ballots			1
" i 'm very excited to exercise my right to vote today , " @entity158 said from @entity0 's @entity160 district			1
" i did n't think i would be able to come out			0
i thought i was going to be blocked by the protesters			0
" others found their efforts to participate frustrated			0
in the @entity0 district of @entity167 , voting was called off because protesters blocked officials from distributing ballot boxes			1
a group of government supporters responded by gathering at the district office chanting , " election , election " and " we want to vote today			2
" meanwhile , opposition supporters reiterated their rejection of the vote			0
" no , i did n't ( vote ) -- i want reform before elections			2
because if i did , we will only get bad people , corrupt politicians , " said @entity182 , a computer technician participating in an anti-government rally in the @entity186 district of @entity0			1
@entity29 's role @entity108 's anti-government protesters say @entity6 is merely a puppet of @entity29 , a polarizing figure who built his support on populist policies that pleased residents of the north and northeast			1
@entity6 has repeatedly denied her brother calls the shots in her government			0
@entity29 , a business tycoon whose electoral success unsettled the @entity1 elite , was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas			1
if he returns , he risks a two - year prison sentence on a corruption conviction , which he says was politically motivated			0
@entity6 's government set off the current crisis with a botched attempt to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for @entity29 's return			0
the move stirred anger around the country			0
@entity1 's worst civil unrest took place in 2010 , when the government -- run at the time by the @entity45 -- ordered a crackdown on largely @entity224 protesters , leaving about 90 people dead			1
