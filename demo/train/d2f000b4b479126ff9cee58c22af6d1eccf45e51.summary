by any measure , the @entity0 for president campaign has had a painfully bad week			1
what went wrong ? the bad news began wednesday			0
that day , @entity0 addressed the @entity6 convention in @entity7			1
the speech was poorly received , so much so that @entity0 , in an interview that afternoon on @entity10 , told host @entity11 that he had " expected " boos			2
some interpreted that comment as proof that @entity0 had actually wanted to be booed by the @entity6 in order to rev up elements of the conservative base			2
the @entity0 campaign next reacted by whispering to the @entity21 ( which acts as a kind of message board for @entity0 ) that it was seriously considering @entity24 as a running mate			1
that story excited the press for half a day , until reporters remembered two hard realities : party conservatives wo n't accept a pro-choice running mate , and @entity32 has made repeated public statements of lack of interest in the vp job			0
the @entity6 story probably moved few votes			0
but it 's interesting in its own right -- and as a warning of the bigger trouble that hit the campaign on thursday			2
the @entity6 incident shows a hyperactive campaign war room , overcorrecting one way ( " the boos are no big deal ; everything 's going according to plan ! " ) and then overcorrecting the other way ( " we were n't trying to generate tv images of racial confrontation ; why , look , here 's @entity24 ! " ) , spinning and counterspinning without any forethought for how this hour 's aggressive statement would sound when the next hour 's realities arrived			2
and it was that " win the hour " mentality that got the @entity0 campaign into much more serious trouble when the @entity65 campaign launched a big push on @entity0 's business record the next day			1
@entity68 : @entity65 's charges vs. @entity0 do n't hold up thursday morning , the @entity65 campaign released a tough ad attacking the record of downsizing and outsourcing at @entity0 's old firm , @entity74			1
the @entity0 campaign reacted with outrage			1
that same day , it announced a multimillion - dollar purchase of airtime for an ad that bluntly accused president @entity65 of lying			0
in support of the ad , @entity0 's team argued that he had left @entity74 in february 1999 ; the incidents alluded to by the @entity65 campaign all occurred after that date and had nothing to do with @entity0			1
the first attack on @entity0 had been a jab , dropping @entity0 's guard against the haymaker : on friday , the @entity65 team counter-charged that it was @entity0 who was lying in his ads or who had committed a felony , lying on 140 official forms that he signed as ceo and sole shareholder of @entity74 between 1999 and 2002			1
@entity0 now chased the @entity65 story , granting five tv interviews to reiterate his version of events			2
the more he talked , the more deeply into trouble he sank			0
by sunday , even @entity0 supporters were urging the thing he wants least : release of more income tax returns			2
and here again , what got @entity0 into the trouble was his war room			0
it was the too - fierce response to attack 1 -- the adamant insistence that @entity0 had nothing , nothing to do with anything that happened at @entity74 after february 1999 -- that set up @entity0 for @entity114 : did he lie on @entity116 forms ? and now he will struggle through the rest of the election trying to reconcile his answers			1
yes , it is technically true that @entity0 ended his operational role at @entity74 before he ended his titular role			1
it was also technically true ( as @entity124 points out ) that @entity125 did vote for the $ 87 billion before he voted against it			0
@entity0 's core problem is this : he heads a party that must win two - thirds of the white working - class vote in presidential elections to compensate for its weakness in almost every demographic category			1
the white working class is the most pessimistic and alienated group in the electorate , and it especially fears and dislikes the kind of financial methods that gained @entity0 his fortune			1
@entity0 has a strong potential defense : @entity142 was in the business of making companies more efficient and profitable			0
downsizing and outsourcing were necessary -- and often indispensable -- means to that end			0
in a growing economy , the workers who lost their jobs should find new jobs elsewhere , and it 's precisely the relentless search for profitability that causes economies to grow in the first place			0
that 's an argument that , to borrow an old joke of @entity158 's , is not only convincing but has the additional merit of being true			0
however , it 's not an argument that appeals much to the voters @entity0 most intensely needs to win			1
hence his unleashing of the war room -- but in the end , there 's only so much a war room can do			0
and this time , by trying to do too much , the @entity0 war room may have blasted its own side with lethal friendly fire			0
follow @ @entity171 on twitter			0

@entity174 : @entity0 's difficult week pointed to a *key* aspect of his campaign
he says @entity0 *desperately* needs support of white working - class vote
that demographic group is most likely to be put off by outsourcing , @entity174 says
@entity184 : @entity0 's effort to *dissociate* himself from @entity74 put him in an odd position
