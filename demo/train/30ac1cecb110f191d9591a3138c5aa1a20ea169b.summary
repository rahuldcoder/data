@entity0 -- @entity3 budget cuts will severely reduce @entity5 military efforts to stop the illegal trafficking of drugs and people into the @entity5 from @entity9 and @entity10 , according to the top @entity5 commander in that region			1
gen. @entity13 , head of the @entity14 , said mandatory budget cuts to the @entity3 will cut the number of ships that patrol the waters of the @entity19 and @entity20 along @entity21 , traditional trafficking routes into the @entity5			1
@entity13 on wednesday said that @entity24 and @entity25 ships seized between 150 to 200 tons of cocaine during drug interdiction operations last year			1
@entity28 approves bill to prevent government shutdown he told a @entity28 panel that the budget cuts could wipe out those successes			1
" next year all of that ( drugs ) will make its way ashore and into the @entity5 , " gen. @entity13 said			2
" @entity24 ops in my area of operations will essentially stop -- go to zero , i believe , " @entity13 said of the sequestration cuts			1
" with a little luck we might see a @entity25 cutter down there , but we 're gon na lose airborne @entity49 ( aircraft surveillance ) in the counter-drug fight , we 'll lose the @entity24 assets , " he said			2
@entity13 said he worries the sophisticated network that moves the drugs and people into the @entity5 would also open up			2
" we watch individuals come into the network from as far away as the @entity58 , " @entity13 said			0
he cited examples of individuals from @entity61 and @entity62 paying a lot of money to take advantage of the complicated network and quietly slip into the @entity5			0
" whatever they 're up to , they 're not coming here to drive a cab in @entity0 and they 're paying a lot of money to get here , " he said			0
@entity13 would not elaborate what these people did when they reached the @entity5			0
under the mandatory budget cuts , the @entity3 's share of cuts would be $ 500 billion -- about half the government total -- over the next decade			1
between now and september , the @entity3 must slash about $ 50 billion across the board , with little ability to move money between accounts			1
@entity13 said @entity86 used to be the top cocaine producing country in the region , but has fallen to number three behind @entity90 and @entity91 , and as much as 20 % of the cocaine moving through @entity93 ends up in the @entity5			0
he said large amounts of drugs also travel through @entity96 and are moved to @entity97 -- providing funding for insurgents and drug traffickers -- and then up into @entity101			0
but as the @entity5 and partner countries have solved much of the ship and fast - boat systems used move drugs , traffickers have invented more sophisticated submarine - like vehicles with even longer range and the ability to hold up to 10 tons of cocaine			0
the new generation of subs are able to elude sea and land surveillance much more easily , according to @entity13 .			0
