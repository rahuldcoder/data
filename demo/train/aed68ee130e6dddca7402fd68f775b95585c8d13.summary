-- a preseason soccer match in @entity2 had to be abandoned after @entity4 protesters invaded the pitch and started attacking players from @entity8 team @entity7			1
clashes between a group of youths carrying @entity13 and @entity14 flags and the @entity7 team broke out at the end of wednesday 's friendly game with @entity19 side @entity18			1
@entity20 has been raging in the @entity21 for more than two weeks now , with @entity23 rockets being fired into @entity8 , which has responded with continued air strikes on @entity25 and a ground incursion into @entity14 territory			1
the conflict has now claimed 732 @entity14 lives , many of them children according to the @entity31 , while @entity8 has reported 35 deaths -- 32 of those soldiers			1
resentment and anger spilled onto the football pitch in the @entity2 town of @entity38 in the @entity39 where @entity7 regularly spends a period training before its domestic campaign begins			1
a group of 20 - 25 flag - waving people had shown up for the match , according to @entity45 , general manager of the team based in the northern @entity8 city of @entity7			1
" they were shouting all the game , " @entity45 told @entity0			2
" this is ok if they want to shout , if they want to demonstrate , but in the 85th minute they went onto the pitch directly to our players , no doubt to engage			1
" it was a little bit using of force and then the police came and it took about 10 minutes before we succeeded to take all our players back to the dressing room			2
" we came here for sport , for football			2
our club is well known , we have in our club hundreds of @entity71 players , in the @entity72 we have five @entity71 players as well as @entity75 players and @entity77 players			1
" we 're not dealing with politics , we are a football team			2
in @entity7 , we are living with peace with all religions			1
you can imagine by yourself the reason why ( this group ) was trying to spoil our camp			0
" i believe most of them do n't even know the reason they demonstrate for			0
but it is not our problem , we came to play football and that 's it -- very clear , very simple			0
" @entity7 has twice made the group stages of the @entity94 , in 2002 - 03 and 2009 - 10 , and has won the @entity8 league 12 times			1
the team is scheduled to play two more matches before its 10 - day stay in @entity2 ends on sunday			0
its domestic season starts in august			0
the @entity100 told @entity0 it is still considering whether to ask @entity103 soccer 's governing body @entity101 to investigate , calling the incident one of " pure violence			1
" " we know @entity101 are against any kind of political activity , " said head of communications @entity107			2
" we are not against protest , it is ok if you come to the game to protest but it is different once they go down to the field			0
" we hope this is something that wo n't happen again			0
" @entity45 praised the reaction of local @entity2 to the incident , many of whom apologized to him and the team , and said it was the first time it had encountered anything like this since heading to the region for its preseason preparations			0
and he also said no - one from @entity7 would be asking @entity101 to investigate			1
" the police here are doing their investigation , it is a local event -- nothing to do with football , " he explained			2
" we have very good relations with the @entity2 teams and with the @entity140			0
" it 's not a question for football , it 's a political question probably and we are not involved in politics at all			0
the policemen took care to investigate and do everything that should be done to make sure it does n't happen again			0
" @entity7 is one of the big four clubs in @entity8 alongside @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154			1
it has a reputation for being an inclusive club and @entity45 said he was " totally disappointed " football and politics had been meshed together on wednesday			2
" wherever we go in @entity103 or wherever we play , we never , never merge together politics and football , " @entity45 said			0
" @entity161 has any problem come out , we are all friends living together with peace			0
" we are all proud @entity8 and we do care what is happening in @entity8 , but we never mixed sports with politics and we are very happy and proud about it at our club			1
" we never thought this event should come to sport or football but it is over			0
" @entity0 contacted the @entity173 , which said it was preparing an official response to the incident			0
@entity19 club @entity18 said in a statement : " although we regret and disapprove any form of violence , mainly those events that occasionally involve sports demonstrations , @entity18 remains a football club and a sports entertainment company and it 's not our duty to comment on political matters			1
" football : new home for @entity188			0
