@entity0 -- the murder of 8 - year - old @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , has brought @entity8 's @entity7 program under the microscope			1
@entity3 vanished in broad daylight on march 27			1
surveillance video from that afternoon showed her happily skipping to go play at her friend 's house			2
after she failed to return home , her family alerted the authorities , but an @entity7 was not issued			1
ten days later , @entity3 's body was found stuffed inside a piece of luggage in an irrigation ditch near her home			1
the frantic search for the killer may be over , as police arrested @entity26 on april 10 and charged her with murder			0
this horrifying case raises the question -- why did n't police issue an @entity7 when @entity3 vanished ? @entity31 have done an excellent job in this case , but could that have made a difference in saving this girl 's life ? first , we must examine what an @entity7 does			1
according to @entity41 , the program is a " partnership between law - enforcement agencies , broadcasters , transportation agencies , and the wireless industry , to activate an urgent bulletin " and is saved for " the most serious child abduction cases			1
" the goal is to blitz the area with information to spark a community - wide search			0
secondarily , the alerts serve as deterrents			2
some abductors have actually freed the kidnapped child after hearing or seeing the alert			0
this happened in @entity5 in january when a man abducted an 8 - year - old girl			0
after observing a highway sign broadcasting an @entity7 for the girl , the suspect dropped the girl off in @entity64 before turning himself in to police			1
in @entity5 , where @entity3 was murdered , 141 children have been safely recovered as a result of @entity68 since 2002 , according to the @entity69			1
the @entity7 web site claims the program has saved more than 430 children nationwide and that in 2007 , 80 percent of kids alerted were recovered safely within three days			1
that is incredibly fast and effective -- two words that are n't often used to describe a government program			2
with such a high success rate , some may wonder why the program is n't used more frequently			0
a grisly case like the @entity3 murder only intensifies this debate			1
the main reason for the limited use of the program is that @entity7 cases must meet very specific criteria			1
otherwise , the alerts will be issued too often , creating a " boy who cried wolf " scenario			1
people will become desensitized and stop taking the alerts seriously			0
after all , @entity94 reports about 800,000 missing child cases any given year			0
very few of those -- slightly more than 100 -- are stereotypical " kidnappings			0
" over half of the 800,000 are kids who ran away , or simply lost track of time , or are part of custody disputes			0
but the @entity94 's @entity7 guidelines are designed to focus on those rare abductions by strangers or slight acquaintances			1
to maintain this focus , the department recommends that @entity110 only be issued when the child is at risk of serious injury or death and law enforcement has sufficient descriptive information about the child , abductor or abductor 's vehicle			2
some argue that @entity3 's case met those criteria			1
but it 's easy to monday - morning quarterback			0
the fact is , @entity31 made a swift arrest and should be applauded			0
they used the full extent of their resources to try to safely recover @entity3 , including dispensing an electronic alert to @entity134 law enforcement agencies , heading a massive search effort and speaking to the media			2
we 'll never know for sure if an @entity7 would have saved @entity3 's life			1
police now say it appears she died before the search even began			0
nevertheless , this case does suggest the @entity7 system can be improved by refining some of the gray areas			2
for instance , the @entity94 has guidelines , but states are free to tweak them			0
that 's why you 'll often hear law enforcement in some states say they ca n't issue an @entity7 without a vehicle description , while others do n't follow that rule			1
all state law enforcement agencies should have to adhere exactly to one set of rules			0
the guidelines are supposedly in place to minimize delays and confusion between jurisdictions			0
well , you know what would really minimize delays and confusion ? a single , uniform system			0
secondly , with today 's technology , the @entity7 program must be expanded			1
we 're no longer just talking about highway signs and @entity172			0
agencies should harness gps and wireless technology , to the point that everyone with a cell phone or @entity179 will receive a notification when there is an @entity7 in the area			2
lastly , the program is a voluntary partnership			0
why not make it mandatory for all agencies that have the capability to use the system ? there is no denying the @entity7 program is a shining example of how a government initiative is supposed to work			1
let 's just make sure we harness its full capabilities			2
our children deserve nothing less			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			2

@entity200 : some ask why no @entity7 issued for missing @entity3
she says alerts are only issued in certain clearly defined *circumstances*
@entity200 : amber alerts have saved many children 's lives
she says the program should be refined to make it even better
