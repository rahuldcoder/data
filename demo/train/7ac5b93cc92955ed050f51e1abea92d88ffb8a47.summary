-- the last time @entity2 won a @entity4 rugby international at @entity6 's home stronghold , the team went on to claim the 2008 title and complete a grand slam of victories against all competing countries			1
four years on , @entity12 's men are looking odds - on to repeat that success after snatching a 19 - 12 victory at @entity16 on saturday for a third successive win in this year 's tournament			1
substitute @entity20 ' moment of late individual brilliance helped @entity2 come from 12 - 6 down , and a desperate try - saving tackle in the corner by fellow center @entity23 condemned defending champions @entity6 to a first defeat under interim coach @entity26			1
the @entity27 were the best of the @entity30 nations at last year 's @entity31 , reaching the semifinals before a heartbreaking defeat against eventual runners - up @entity34 in which captain @entity36 was sent off			0
@entity6 , however , had a disappointing time on and off the pitch , losing to @entity34 in the quarterfinals before an investigation into a series of incidents involving the players ended with 2003 @entity31 winner @entity44 standing down as coach and ructions in the boardroom			2
@entity26 made a positive start with his new - look team , grinding out wins against @entity51 and @entity52 , and four penalties from young new fly - half @entity54 gave the coach hope of another victory			1
however , @entity2 fought back from the second - half sin - binning of @entity54 's opposing no. 10 @entity59 and drew level with fullback @entity63 's fourth successful kick			2
then @entity20 stole the show in the 76th minute as he ripped the ball away from @entity6 replacement @entity66 , kicked downfield and gathered the ball for the game 's only try , which @entity63 converted			1
@entity6 roared back down the other end and threatened to score , but after spinning the ball out wide to the right , winger @entity71 was held up over the line -- forcing a decision from the video referee , which went in @entity2 ' favor			2
" we knew it would be the toughest game and it was so tough			0
we are over the moon to get the @entity86 here , " @entity36 said after his team followed up victories over @entity51 and @entity84			2
" i am not going to say what the last team who won here in 2008 went on to do but people involved with that team say we have a really strong squad this time around			0
however , we will set aside thoughts of that and the @entity52 game in a fortnight and enjoy this for the moment			0
" earlier on saturday , @entity84 ended a run of three home defeats by beating @entity52 42 - 10 in @entity103 for the 2009 champions ' first win this season			1
winger @entity107 scored two of his side 's five tries , while @entity111 kicked 17 points as the visitors lost for the third successive time			0
@entity34 -- the only other unbeaten team so far , albeit after having played only one game -- will visit winless @entity51 on sunday			0
@entity34 ' postponed match against @entity84 will take place next weekend while the other nations rest .			0

@entity2 beat @entity6 19 - 12 for third successive victory in the @entity4
replacement center @entity20 conjures up the only try of the game at @entity16
@entity6 suffer first defeat of the tournament under interim coach @entity26
@entity84 win first match of *competition* , beating *bottom* team @entity52 42 - 10 in @entity103
