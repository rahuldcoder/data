-- recently , @entity1 in @entity2 issued a memo to its students outlining what not to wear to work - study jobs			1
for one : low - cut tops			2
" i really do n't need to mention that cleavage and stiletto heels are not appropriate office wear ( outside of ridiculous lawyer tv shows ) , do i ? " asks the author of a memo entitled " @entity11 " but then goes on to mention it anyway			1
" the legal community is small in @entity2 and judges and lawyers who have unprofessional experiences with externs talk freely amongst themselves about the experiences			0
" it can also be sexist			0
i 'm talking about the memo , of course , which offers no such guidelines on appearance for men , if we 're to assume that men are n't among those whose cleavage and heels are generating whispers within @entity38 courtrooms			2
the memo 's implication is that there 's a relationship between how women look and how well they do their jobs , and that it 's okay to judge a woman on her appearance			1
it 's one thing to acknowledge that a bias exists in society , but quite another to insist on kowtowing to it , and to expectations that are , in most cases , initiated and maintained by men , but not imposed on men			2
women are very often reduced to , or at least measured by , their looks , in every industry , and the message can be infuriatingly contradictory			2
look good , but not too good			0
pay attention to vanity , but do n't be obvious about it			0
be different , but about the same as everyone else			0
the @entity1 memo noted that the school had received " complaints from supervisors " about students ' dress , though it is n't specific about the nature or number of the complaints			1
while it 's possible that some women may go overboard , perhaps the topic could have been addressed with the individual ( s ) against whom the complaints were filed			1
after all , overboard is both subjective and confusing			0
at least one law professor advised women to get ahead by wearing " skirts to appeal to men , makeup to look healthy and competent , and heels to appear more powerful			0
" what 's a constant , though , is that looks matter , and usually that attractiveness pays			0
so why should n't women , who face any number of disadvantages in the workplace , use what they can to get ahead ? according to research by @entity95 , author of " @entity93 : why attractive people are more successful , " the top one - third of attractive females earns about 10 % more annually than those in the bottom sixth of the genetic pool			1
a 2006 study from the @entity102 that looked at the role of beauty in politics found that the better - looking the candidate , the more competent , trustworthy and likeable he or she was perceived to be			1
when it comes to dress , a recent @entity110 study found that dressing distinctly could make a woman appear confident and influential , two qualities especially relevant for courtroom lawyers			2
we ca n't blame @entity1 for society 's obsession with appearance , and if judges and juries are indeed forming opinions about female lawyers ' abilities based on the length of their skirts , it 's important for would - be lawyers to recognize that			1
it 's not right , but perhaps it 's a reality			0
law in particular is a profession that relies heavily on the opinions and very real biases of others			0
that said , we can hold the school responsible for helping to perpetuate the mixed messages women receive about their appearance , and for issuing a memo that , while perhaps useful in spirit , was insulting and condescending in tone			1
@entity1 is a highly rated law school ; it stands to reason that the students accepted there have at least some common sense and social awareness			1
presumably there are some brains behind those bodies			0
by widely issuing the memo using the language it did , @entity1 expressed doubt in the abilities of its female students to make their own decisions regarding something as basic as what to wear			1
it 's important for a school that 's in the business of educating women to recognize and support the idea that women can be both smart and attractive ; to help shift the conversation from an either / or			1
meanwhile , women should keep pushing the boundaries and resisting definitions , and wearing what they deem appropriate			0
there was a time , after all , that pantsuits were considered " shocking " courtroom garb , a convention that changed because women insisted it change			0
with persistence , eventually what will matter most is how women perform their jobs , and not which shoes they happened to choose that morning			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			2

a @entity1 memo advises students what not to wear to work - study jobs
@entity183 : memo implies that women 's looks and job performance are related
she says the memo , while perhaps useful in spirit , was insulting in tone
@entity183 : does school doubt women 's ability to make common sense choices ?
