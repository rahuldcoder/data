@entity0 -- veterans groups are warning president @entity3 against going ahead with a possible administration move to charge veterans ' private health care for service - related injuries			1
veterans groups say it 's " wholly unacceptable " to charge their private insurance for service injuries			1
in a letter sent by 11 of the most prominent veterans organizations , the groups warned that the idea " is wholly unacceptable and a total abrogation of our government 's moral and legal responsibility to the men and women who have sacrificed so much			0
" @entity1 obtained a copy of the letter sent to the @entity25 last friday by groups including @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , and @entity31 and @entity32			2
read the letter ( @entity34 ) a @entity25 spokesman would neither confirm nor deny the option is being considered			1
" the details of specific proposals will be transmitted with the full submission in april			0
the president has made it clear that meeting the needs of veterans is one of his priorities , and as a result has requested an 11 percent increase in discretionary funding for 2010 , and the administration is actively working with the veterans community to ensure we get the details of this budget right , " said @entity25 spokesman @entity40			2
in the letter , the groups said they have been told by sources on @entity58 and at the @entity59 that the idea under consideration would allow the @entity59 to bill health insurance for a treatment of a disability or injury that was a result of military service			2
the argument for the proposal is that it frees up money for the @entity59 by charging the private insurers , allowing the @entity59 to spend on more services , said @entity72 , legislative director for @entity28 , who opposes the idea			1
while there could be savings , @entity72 warned it also could lead to an increase in premiums for veterans with private coverage			0
" " we can not and would not agree to any proposal that would expand this concept any further , " the heads of the 11 groups wrote in the letter			0
" while we understand the fiscal difficulties this country faces right now , placing the burden of those fiscal problems on the men and women who have already sacrificed a great deal for this country is unconscionable			0
" currently , veterans ' private insurance is only charged when they receive health care from the @entity59 for medical issues that are not related to service injuries , like getting the flu			1
charging for service - related injuries would violate " a sacred trust , " said @entity30 spokesman @entity104			1
@entity104 said the move would risk private health care for veterans and their families by potentially maxing out benefits paying for costly war injury treatments			0
it could also make it harder for veterans to get private insurance if the companies decide to reject them for pre-existing conditions , rather than be billed for service - connected injuries , @entity104 said			1
" this seems like bad politics and bad policy , " said @entity120 policy director @entity119 , noting that every veterans group opposes it and warns it will adversely affect veterans			0
" i do n't see this as a tenable option			0

possible change in billing angers veterans groups
