-- those who live in fear today imagine that @entity3 is being overrun by foreign , disease - carrying , tax - sucking criminal hordes			1
they can not imagine that immigrants , whether documented or not , could ever contribute to our country			2
they refer to the children and families trying to cross the southern border as " illegals			2
" but to quote @entity16 , who fought 50 years ago for civil rights and fights now for immigration reform , " there is no such thing as an illegal human being			0
words are expressions of power and identity			1
and even something as trivial as punctuation can say a lot about what it means to become @entity3			1
for instance , i never hyphenate			0
as i explain in my new book " a @entity32 , " i call myself " @entity34 " -- without a hyphen			1
@entity3 is the noun , @entity34 the adjective			1
or , rather , @entity34 is one adjective			1
i am many kinds of @entity3 , after all : a politically active @entity3 , a short @entity3 , an earnest @entity3 , an educated @entity3			1
this is not a quibble about grammar ; it 's a claim about the very act of claiming this country			0
the hyphenated form , " @entity34 , " to me signifies a transaction between two parties , as in @entity34 - @entity3 diplomatic negotiation or @entity34 - @entity3 commerce and trade			1
the hyphen implies a state of interchange across nations			2
it does not name a person , much less a citizen			0
for the same reason , i never really accepted the label that my immigrant parents attached to me and other second - generation kids : " @entity62 , " or @entity3 - born @entity61			1
i understand why they used it			0
they had been formed in @entity66			0
they were deeply culturally @entity34 and as they tried to make their way in this country and raise kids , they hoped those kids would think of themselves the same way			1
we did n't , exactly			0
the second generation rarely does			0
while @entity77 was a deep influence on my palate and vocabulary and moral sensibility , i grew up in this land , an @entity3			1
i went to @entity34 school on sundays , but i counted the minutes until i could get back to playing baseball with my best friend @entity85			1
i was raised at home with a @entity34 belief in family obligation and social propriety , but i was schooled everywhere else in an @entity3 spirit of individual invention and reinvention			1
actually , my immigrant dad taught me this			0
he 's the one who introduced me to the noxious phrase , " a chinaman 's chance , " which since the 1850s had meant " slim to no chance			0
" when he came here in the late 1950s , he decided , with his wry sense of humor , to reappropriate this slur			0
he would apply it playfully to commonplace situations , such as saying that the @entity105 had " a chinaman 's chance " of making a ninth - inning comeback			2
that 's how i grew up			0
to call me " @entity3 - born @entity61 " is to make my birthplace and upbringing incidental rather than central			1
it is to imply that wherever a person of @entity34 ethnicity may be born , he is not truly of that place ; he is just a sojourner , attached to a vast global web of @entity34			1
that 's not the way of our nation			0
in @entity3 , immigrants become @entity3 -- and by so doing , change @entity3			1
we 've already become heavily @entity124			0
now -- to the surprise of many -- @entity126 have become @entity3 's fastest - growing group			1
people who look like me can no longer be presumed foreign until proven otherwise			0
we are becoming the new face of the @entity3			1
in 1914 or 1814 , when @entity133 or @entity134 were coming in great waves ( uninvited by government , by the way , and unsanctioned by law ) , " becoming @entity3 " meant assimilating to a white , wasp way			2
in 2014 , it means entering a vibrant and more complex omniculture that mixes the styles and memes of the entire world			0
this should n't be scary			0
for what makes @entity3 enduringly great is precisely this ability to synthesize the best of the rest of the planet			2
that 's our edge -- as long as we do n't blow it			2
yes , not blowing it includes taking illegal immigration seriously because borders do matter , and so does enforcing borders			0
but it primarily means keeping our eye on the bigger picture : that we are stronger when we are more inclusive and better when we activate our full diversity			0
welcoming and integrating legal immigrants is therefore a necessity			0
so is creating a pathway to citizenship for our undocumented neighbors , friends and colleagues so that we do n't leave millions of people stuck in second - class limbo			2
there will never be a simple answer to the eternal @entity3 question , " who is ' us ' ? " but in this moment when jobs feel scarcer and life feels more zero - sum , we have to make a conscious choice to be bigger than our fears			1
that , without hyphens or hyperventilating , is the true @entity3 way .			2

@entity186 : words are expressions of power and identity , and even punctuation matters
**liu** : as i explain in my new book , i call myself " @entity34 " -- without a hyphen
he says the hyphenated " @entity34 " signifies a transaction between two parties
**liu** : similarly , " @entity62 , " or @entity3 - born @entity61 , is also inadequate in its identity label
