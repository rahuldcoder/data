in sting operation last july , undercover @entity1 agents gained access to a hotel suite by disabling the hotel 's @entity5 , and then posing as internet repair technicians			1
now one of the suspects who was charged in the sting is crying foul			0
at @entity13 , a casino hotel on the @entity14 in @entity14 , @entity1 agents deliberately cut off the internet for a suite used by @entity17 , a high - stakes gambler			1
then , they showed up at the suite and made a bogus service call			2
on their undercover video , you can hear the imposters asking their targets what the trouble is			0
we 're going to see if we can get the dsl working again , " one of them says			0
but during the visit , the agents were actually videotaping the hotel room and its occupants in secret , looking for evidence of online gambling			1
@entity17 was subsequently charged with operating an illegal gambling business , some of which was allegedly conducted using the computers set up at the hotel			2
authorities allege he is a high - ranking member of the 14 - k triad , an @entity44 crime syndicate			0
but he is fighting the charges , saying they are based on evidence collected under false pretenses , and that any evidence obtained through a warrantless search based on deception should be tossed out			0
" the evidence is the fruit of a flagrant violation of the @entity56 , " his lawyers said in a court filing			0
the @entity1 declined to comment , referring inquiries to the prosecutor 's office in @entity14			1
the prosecutors ' office said it will respond in court to the complaint , but could not comment to the media on a pending case			0
but former @entity1 assistant director @entity66 , who served on the agency 's review committee for undercover operations for five years , said undercover operations are carefully reviewed before they are conducted , including by agency lawyers			1
" the idea that the entire division went rogue and ran this operation without @entity1 headquarters ' concurrence , or senior executive management concurrence and approval , and the @entity81 attorneys , it just does n't sound right to me , " @entity66 said			2
he also said a citizen might not be able to expect the same right to privacy in the common room of his hotel suite , as he would at home in his bedroom			1
but @entity89 , an attorney for @entity17 , says the public should be concerned that authorities are trying to surreptitiously conduct searches , using a service interruption as a pretext			0
" the danger here is that agents will cut off not only the @entity5 , but your electricity , your phone , your cable television , " said @entity89 , " or at least , you 'll worry that it 's the government -- every time you have a problem in your house -- that maybe it 's an undercover agent that responds			1
