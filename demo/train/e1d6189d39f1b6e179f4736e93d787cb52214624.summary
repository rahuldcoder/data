-- " @entity2 's " @entity1 has been off the air since late september , but his legacy is still looming over @entity5 , @entity6 , where the series was set and filmed			1
fans seeking one last goodbye to the tv character , who transformed from a milquetoast chemistry teacher into a treacherous meth kingpin over the course of five acclaimed seasons on @entity16 , gathered in @entity5 on saturday for a mock funeral			1
@entity0 affiliate @entity18 said ahead of the service that the plan was to bury a " small vault filled with memorabilia " as fans said their goodbyes			2
with a eulogy given by " @entity2 " set decorator @entity32 and a procession led by a hearse , the show 's famous banged - up rv , and a few @entity30 deputies , the event was attended by roughly 200 people , the @entity25 reports			1
the faux service , held at @entity5 's @entity38 , doubled as a fundraiser for @entity40 for the @entity41 , as attendees paid to participate			2
according to the funeral 's website , $ 20 bought entrance to the funeral " and a handful of earth to help bury @entity1			2
" yet for some who have laid actual family members to rest at @entity38 , the fake grave site is , at the least , a nuisance			1
" it 's going to be difficult to look up and see something going on over there that really should n't , " resident @entity56 told @entity18			0
" this is too much			0
i bring my family here to visit their grandpa and my wife to visit her dad ... what 's going to happen come @entity65 , come @entity66 on those hard days for me and my family ? it 's hard to come when we miss my father - in - law so much			0
it 's going to be hard to see people over there decorating something for somebody that was n't real			0
" more than 900 people who agree with that sentiment have signed an online petition asking @entity38 to remove the grave site , which includes a headstone			1
officials at the cemetery told the @entity25 that the mock burial was in the clear as long as the cemetery could remove the grave if it became a distraction for others			0
" we are a cemetery first and foremost , " @entity38 general manger @entity88 told the paper			0
" our allegiance lies with our families that have allowed us to bury their loved ones here			0
" the online petition asserts that " the ' officials ' should not put the family members through such disrespect during the process of deciding whether or not too many people are visiting the makeshift grave			1
" for now , it seems the petitioners have won out			0
according to @entity18 , the @entity16 character 's fake grave has been moved , and the headstone is not being kept at the cemetery			1
while fans may not always have a physical place to mourn the loss of @entity1 , who was played by @entity112 , they can always hold on to the obituary			2
