@entity0 -- the @entity2 moved closer wednesday to its next military trial on the @entity5 base at @entity6 , @entity7 , for the suspected ringleader of the deadly bombing of the @entity10			1
@entity12 - born former millionaire @entity11 is charged with the 2000 bombing in the @entity15 port of @entity16 that killed 17 sailors , wounded dozens and crippled the warship			0
the " referral of charges " by the @entity34 unit sets in motion a chain of events that will lead to the appointment of a military officer as the trial judge in the case and a meeting of the judge , prosecutors and defense lawyers in coming weeks			1
the arraignment will take place within 30 days			0
a statement from the @entity34 said the charges against @entity11 allege that he was in charge of planning the attack , which took place october 12 , 2000			1
" the convening authority referred the charges to a capital military commission , meaning that if convicted , @entity11 could be sentenced to death , " the @entity34 statement said			1
the news release also mentions charges against @entity11 related to an attempted attack on the @entity49 in @entity15 in january 2000 and an attack on a @entity52 tanker in 2002 that resulted in the death of one crew member			1
one of @entity11 's civilian defense lawyers said his legal team was disappointed in the government action			0
" we are disappointed the @entity61 will now descend further down the path of expedient and secret justice that military commissions have come to represent , " @entity58 said in an e-mail			1
" we 're not talking about a constitutionally adequate trial , and we are disappointed that the @entity61 government will use the constitutionally inadequate military commissions process to seek the death penalty against mr. @entity11 , " @entity58 wrote			1
he added that the decision to move forward with the case " regrettably confirms to the world that the @entity61 intends to render second - class justice to the men imprisoned in @entity6			2
" earlier , lawyers for @entity11 argued that his waterboarding and other mistreatment while in @entity61 custody and delays in his case should have forced the government to drop any plans for a military trial that could end in a death sentence			1
" by torturing mr. @entity11 and subjecting him to cruel , inhumane and degrading treatment , the @entity61 has forfeited its right to try him and certainly to kill him , " the brief said			0
" through the infliction of physical and psychological abuse , the government has essentially already killed the man it seized almost 10 years ago			2
" @entity90 's legal team , comprising military and civilian lawyers , made the arguments to the " convening authority " of the military court , retired vice adm. @entity95			2
the commission was brought into existence by president @entity98 and overhauled by president @entity99			2
in legal papers obtained by @entity1 , @entity11 's lawyers presented details of their client 's treatment , saying that , in addition to subjecting their client to waterboarding , his questioners revved a power drill by his ear and chambered a round in a handgun , all while he was naked and hooded			0
" the government has admitted to waterboarding mr. @entity11 and subjecting him to verbal and physical threats to his life and threats to the safety of his family , " the brief says			0
" both set of acts constitute torture			0
" if it goes to trial , the case will be the first full prosecution under the military commission system			1
it is seen as the latest fine - tuning of the system before the military commission moves ahead with prosecution of other terrorist suspects , especially the four men accused of plotting the september 11 attacks			1
the @entity134 issued a news release restating its " concerns about the inherent unfairness of the military commissions			1
" " unlike federal courts , military commissions have unfairly lax rules for allowing evidence , except when it comes to torture -- the commissions may admit coerced testimony , while evidence of the torture that produced it can be censored , " said @entity147 , director of the @entity148			2
this latest step for the @entity6 detainee comes as the new chief prosecutor for military commissions , @entity153			1
gen. @entity155 , is taking over			0
@entity155 was first in his class at @entity157 , was a @entity158 at @entity159 and graduated magna cum laude from @entity161			0
he will have the chance to put his stamp on the job amid renewed scrutiny of both the military trials and the @entity168 detention facilities			2
in a recent @entity170 profile , @entity155 is portrayed as the man the administration hopes will bring new credibility and legitimacy to the system			2
he has powerful friends , including his former commander , gen. @entity177 , now @entity178 director			0
@entity177 gave @entity155 the job of cleaning up the military detention and interrogation system in @entity182 , and @entity155 delivered			0
in an effort to polish the reputation of the military commission system , both inside the @entity61 and internationally , @entity155 may push for greater transparency of the process			1
he could roll out a plan the @entity2 has been working on for months to provide closed - circuit television transmissions of the military proceedings to victims , families and journalists in the @entity61			0
there would be a " kill " switch in the control room to wipe out the audio in case any national security secrets were blurted out in the courtroom			0
@entity90 is one of 171 detainees remaining at @entity6 .			0

the man suspect of being behind the attack on the @entity10 will go on trial
the formal " referral of charges " is the first step in the military commission process
his attorneys and the @entity134 *criticize* the decision to use a military commission
