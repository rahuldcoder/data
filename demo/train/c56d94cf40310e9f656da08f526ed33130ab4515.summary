-- as a writer , one of my most important responsibilities is listening			0
i try to do so with an open mind , so i can hear the voices of the characters whose stories i will tell			0
when i wrote about @entity11 women in my second novel , i thought about the brave women i had met in @entity14 and about their stories			1
their voices came to me in hushed whispers			0
at times they woke me in the night with the urgency of what they had to say			0
i am indebted to those women , because without them , my novels would lack authenticity and would also be far less likely to resonate with readers			2
supporting women 's rights in @entity11 is largely about listening			1
a recent report from international aid organization @entity28 summarizes it best : the voices of women in @entity11 must be heard if a lasting peace is to be achieved and " the international community is to fulfill its agenda of setting @entity11 on its own feet			1
" in recent years , women have made incredible gains in @entity11			1
the end of @entity38 rule has meant a new @entity11 , with more opportunities for women			1
millions of girls are back in school			0
women are working , particularly in @entity14 , as professionals in a wide range of fields			2
@entity11 has a female provincial governor ; there are women serving in parliament , the @entity51 , the @entity52 and the @entity53			1
only the hardest cynic would dismiss these accomplishments as insignificant			0
yet far too many women in @entity11 are still denied a place at the table -- denied the right to speak for themselves			1
@entity28 's report illustrates how war and unrest , illiteracy , poverty and gender discrimination have made it nearly impossible for the vast majority of women in @entity11 to contribute to the global dialogue about the future of their homeland			1
without them , the gains that have been made in recent years for half of @entity11 's most brilliant resources remain at risk			2
when i was a boy living in @entity14 , i had a different experience			0
a different political environment meant women were respected -- their intelligence and accomplishments greatly valued			2
my mother was a teacher and school administrator			0
she was known on campus for her confidence and effective leadership			0
my aunt was a professor at @entity89			0
she inspired young men and women to be creative and poetic , furthering @entity11 's rich cultural and artistic legacy			1
my cousin was a physician			0
men and women alike relied on her skill , strength and kindness			0
the women i have met in @entity11 in recent years are equally talented			1
though most have been denied education , survive without access to even basic health care and often lack even rudimentary shelter , they are determined , resilient , resourceful and optimistic			2
they have a truly indomitable spirit and are the real backbones of families and communities			0
if @entity110 is to exist once again as a peaceful and thriving nation , it must make women 's rights one of the cornerstones of national reconstruction			1
any peace negotiations with insurgent groups must ensure that @entity11 women are able to exercise their rights and participate in every facet of @entity11 society without fear of retribution			1
they must be given political , social and economic power to help usher in and sustain the country 's long - term redevelopment			0
most importantly , @entity11 women must be allowed the opportunity to be heard			1
as the @entity129 on @entity11 approaches in @entity130 , @entity131 , world leaders must insist that women not only participate in the @entity11 delegation but that all discussions around peace and reconciliation include how women will be involved			2
@entity11 women 's voices are an indispensable resource and without them , the story of peace and prosperity can not be told			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity146 .			2

@entity146 : @entity28 report says @entity11 women must have voice in @entity11
he says women in @entity11 have gained since @entity38 days but are still denied rights
he says women had positions , education and authority when he was growing up there
@entity146 : a condition for groups to take part in rebuilding nation must be full rights for women
