@entity0 , @entity1 -- when it comes to recruiting , @entity4 's athletics department is taking an " if we build it , they will come " approach , with plans to construct a new $ 20 million indoor practice facility for its football and other sports teams near @entity13 on the university campus			1
the @entity15 have the third - longest college bowl game streak in the country , and have sold out every game since 1998			1
however , they have yet to win a national championship			2
the athletics department hopes a state - of - the - art facility nearer to the football stadium could help change that			1
there 's only one problem : a densely wooded area chock full of old - growth trees , some older than the @entity27 itself , is in the way			1
blueprint plans that have been in the works for over a decade would require chopping down at least 60 trees over the age of 150			1
six of the trees have been found to be more than 300 years old			1
a group called @entity40 and @entity4 professor @entity41 are determined not to let those trees come down			1
@entity41 , a professor of forest biology and a tree physiology specialist , has dedicated his entire career to the university and often takes his students into these 11 acres of woods to teach			1
so when he was told by university administration officials that they believed no tree in the woods was more than 80 years old and the new facility site was a " done deal , " @entity41 decided to do something about it			1
in january , he bought a large increment borer -- a tool used to extract a section of wood from a living tree used to determine its age -- and took a walk into the familiar woods			2
after testing a few trees , he discovered something amazing			1
" this was like catching a big fish for me , " he said , pointing to a small slice of wood in his office			2
" that wood was formed from carbon dioxide in the air , turned into wood by photosynthesis , in 1697			2
" @entity41 believes the forest is a national treasure and should be saved			2
" the forest is in fact an endangered species in the @entity27			2
it 's literally the rarest type of forest structure left in the @entity27			0
" armed with the tree - testing evidence , @entity41 hoped the discussion would end right then and there , that the athletics department would consider building at another location			1
instead , they pushed back , insisting on moving forward on the original plans			0
@entity4 president dr. @entity90 in january appointed an ad hoc committee to hear the arguments and make a recommendation on whether the facility should be built as planned or at at alternate location			1
@entity90 took his own walk through the woods but confessed he could n't tell the significance or the age of the trees			1
" i 'm not qualified to judge			0
... i ca n't tell the age of a tree			1
i forget my own birthday on occasion , " the president joked			0
" so , we 'll see what the report has to say and at the end of the day we 'll do the right thing			0
" the committee has been holding closed - door sessions for months now			1
@entity113 , a professor of urban affairs and planning , chairs the committee and acknowledges the school faces a " conflict of value			1
" " we 're a big - time football school and a lot of people care about that , " @entity113 said			1
" we are also a green university			0
we 're ( among ) @entity123 's ' @entity122 ' and we 're a @entity125 designee			0
" the committee surveyed faculty members and staff on campus and found most were in favor of saving the trees			1
the sentiment for preserving the woods is " pretty clear and pretty overwhelming , " @entity113 said			0
" very few have indicated that athletics should probably decide where this should go			0
" still , committee members have continued to meet to balance that perceived majority opinion with the importance of the new facility			1
fundraising , new facilities and trying to be competitive in a very competitive football environment -- an indoor practice facility is kind of a key part of that element , " @entity113 said			1
" a lot of the big schools are adding them			0
" according to @entity153 , college football contributor for @entity155 , close - by practice facilities are essential to college athletics programs ' recruiting			2
" a lot of other programs have smaller , convenient , localized facilities			0
if you can stick it closer it helps recruiting , " @entity161 said			0
" but the buzzword is efficiency			0
it 's the idea of let 's have everything in a central location and try to squeeze the most into their day			0
" @entity41 said he and other advocates for the forest " are not against this facility at all			2
we 're simply saying you need to put it in the alternate location , which does n't have to cut a single tree			1
" he was referring to a suggested spot , right next to the woods , that is currently occupied by tennis courts , but not all students like that idea			2
" you use the tennis courts a lot more than i see people using the trees and hanging around the trees , " recent @entity4 graduate @entity186 said			1
a less preferable alternative would be the area where a large parking lot is currently situated , but the campus has a critical need for parking and the space is already set aside for a future parking garage , said @entity113 , the committee chairman			0
@entity113 said the opposing sides might " have to give a little on the edges , but if their core values can be represented , that 's the idea			0
" with signs urging " @entity207 " placed in yards throughout @entity0 , and an online petition signed by more than 9,000 people across the country , @entity41 and members of @entity212 hope public sentiment will sway the committee			0
but they are also preparing for the chance that the committee recommends building at the stadium woods location and are willing to go to extreme lengths if they have to			0
" there will be things that we can do if they decide to site it in the woods , " @entity221 , executive director of @entity40 says			2
" like chaining people to trees and putting people up in the trees			2
" @entity41 noted that the committee recommendation is not binding			0
" the administration can make a different decision and the board of visitors will have the final say , " he said			0
the committee plans to deliver their final report to university vice president @entity241 by friday			0
@entity241 will then prepare his recommendations to @entity90 , and the university 's @entity243 will be briefed by @entity113 on monday .			0

@entity4 wants to build a new , $ 20 million indoor sports facility
many old - growth trees near @entity13 would have to come down
a professor is leading efforts to block construction at the planned site
two suggested alternate locations are n't *popular* choices , either
