welcome to an eastern @entity21 style salt cave which claims to rid asthma and allergy sufferers of their breathing problems through " salt therapy , " also known as halotherapy			1
with the sound of waves playing in the background and the sand - like mound of salt underfoot , the place could easily be mistaken for an exotic snow beach			2
before entering the salt chamber , visitors are required to wear a shower cap to cover their hair and shoes to preserve the salt 's purity			2
during each hour - long session they simply sit back , relax and put their feet up while soaking up the saturated air and tranquil atmosphere			0
salt therapy claims to work by clearing the airways of mucus and reducing inflammation triggered by allergies to dust , pollen or pollution			1
minerals including potassium and magnesium are said to clean out mucus blocking the airways			0
the treatment is widely used in @entity62 and @entity63 , where people with chronic breathing disorders often spend two to three hours per day in underground salt grottos			1
the @entity63 government even approved " salt caves " for medical use in 1995			2
in the @entity71 , the trend has been adopted in the @entity73 area with the popular @entity74			0
several spas in other parts of the country have also installed salt breathing rooms			2
in 2006 , the @entity79 published a study on patients with cystic fibrosis who used this kind of saline therapy for 48 weeks			2
the study found that it was a safe and effective additional therapy for patients			2
the benefits of salt therapy were first discovered in the late 1800s when workers in @entity8 salt mines were found to suffer from a surprisingly small number of respiratory problems			1
familiar with such treatments in her hometown , @entity93 from @entity94 was therefore surprised when she moved to the @entity11 two years ago and discovered there were no salt caves in the country			2
have you used the salt cave ? did it work for you ? would you visit one ? tell us in the @entity105 box below " i was suffering from sinus problems and antibiotics did n't work			1
i had heard so many stories of how salt caves had treated friends ' problems , so i decided to open one in @entity1 , " the 30 - year - old told @entity2			1
the salt , which has no additives , is shipped in from @entity117			2
@entity93 's patients vary from six - month - olds to 65 - year - olds and most are asthmatic children who come in with their parents			0
ideally , treatment lasts one to two weeks and patients need to be in the cave for one to two hours every day , @entity93 says			1
the room 's temperature and salt concentration depending on the patients ' condition			1
the benefits are then said to last for up to 12 months			0

" i noticed first thing in the morning i was n't as congested as i usually am			0
having now done ten sessions , i have n't yet taken an allergy tablet this year , which is incredible for me			0
" despite the positive testimonials , the therapy has not yet been recognized by the @entity11 's @entity147 ( @entity147 ) and at least one study suggests the therapy should be used as a complementary therapy , not as an alternative			0
dr @entity152 of @entity153 , said : " it 's currently impossible for us to say whether or not salt caves are beneficial for people with asthma			1
however , some people say they find them helpful			0
" our advice to people with asthma is to follow the recommendations of your doctor or asthma nurse , and to keep them informed if you decide to try a complementary treatment such as halotherapy			1
" other health practitioners say stopping medication like steroids for asthma and only opting for alternative care can be dangerous and counter-productive			0
but , according to @entity93 , some of her patients have stopped medication , not because she urged them to			0
" i would never do that , " she said			0
the reason for this is because their symptoms were no longer present after undergoing salt therapy , she said .			1

treatment is based on a room recreating the conditions of @entity8 salt mines
the process is called salt therapy , also known as halotherapy
