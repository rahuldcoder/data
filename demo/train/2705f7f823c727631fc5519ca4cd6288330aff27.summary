-- the e-mail ended with a question that belied the author 's pain : " it 's a small world , is n't it ? " @entity7 read the message from @entity9 again			1
@entity9 worked at @entity10 , just like him			1
she had three sons , like him			1
and her youngest , @entity7 , was the donor who had changed his life			2
" it sent shivers down my body , you know , because you do n't expect ... " @entity7 's voice , with its lingering @entity22 accent , trails off			2
@entity7 , 53 , was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 1982			1
people who have type 1 diabetes do not produce insulin , a hormone the body needs to convert sugar and starches into energy			1
their white blood cells attack and destroy the cells that produce insulin in the pancreas			1
like most @entity37 diabetics , @entity7 learned to control his diabetes with insulin injections and constant monitoring			1
but he still experienced hypoglycemic attacks when his blood sugar levels got too low			1
it was like being in a fog -- one he could n't escape until someone helped him			2
if it went on too long , he would lose consciousness			2
as he got older , @entity7 's body adapted to the extreme lows ; so when his blood sugar levels dropped below normal , he did n't experience the typical symptoms			1
in other words , he did n't know he was in danger until he passed out			2
" over time , your body just starts to break down , " he says			2
" they say ( diabetes ) is a slow killer , and it is			1
" tiny cells offer hope pancreas transplants for patients such as @entity7 are not typically an option because they are difficult to perform , said dr. @entity63 , associate professor of medicine at @entity65			1
but an experimental procedure using the pancreas ' islet cells is being tested at medical centers around the country			1
if it 's approved by the @entity72 , it could make a difference for patients who are no longer able to successfully manage their diabetes			1
islet cells contain beta cells that produce insulin , as well as alpha cells that produce a hormone called glucagon			1
both are used to regulate the body 's glucose , or sugar , levels			1
in the 1990s , scientists in @entity88 , @entity89 , figured out how to isolate these islets from a deceased donor 's pancreas and transplant them into the liver of a diabetic patient			1
the procedure was dubbed the " @entity96			2
" since then , researchers have been trying to improve the survival rate of the cells during transplantation			1
most patients who undergo the procedure now need two infusions of islet cells to maintain normal glucose levels long - term			1
@entity63 and his colleagues recently published a study in the journal diabetes detailing a new protocol , which gives the extracted islets three days to " rest " before they 're transferred to the living recipient			1
all of the patients in @entity63 ' study were able to come off insulin therapy for at least a year after a single transplant			1
data from patients in other countries where the procedure has already been approved shows some patients can stop using insulin for anywhere from five to 10 years , @entity63 said			1
@entity7 had been following the islet cell research since the 1990s			1
one saturday morning , after a particularly bad hypoglycemic attack , he decided to fill out a survey to see whether he qualified for a trial funded by the @entity127			2
two days later , he received a message from the @entity129 in @entity130			2
@entity7 flew from his home in @entity132 , @entity133 , to @entity134 to learn more about the transplant			2
dr. @entity136 , director of the @entity137 at @entity129 , told @entity7 that the procedure would take less than two hours and he would be home within two or three days			2
he would , however , have to remain on immunosuppressant drugs the rest of his life			2
the drugs prevent the patient 's white blood cells from attacking the new islet cells , @entity136 explained			1
the next year was filled with medical tests			2
@entity7 did n't receive a donor pancreas in time to participate in the government trial			2
but he discovered his employer health insurance would pay for the experimental transplant			2
his doctors helped him submit a request to the @entity72 to get the private procedure approved			1
now all he needed was a donor			2
a life cut short @entity157 was a good kid , his mom , @entity158 , says			2
" growing up , he was my pain in the butt , " she remembers with a laugh			0
" he was my third child			0
he was the one who gave me the headaches			0
" he was also a giving person			0
when his mom took him to the @entity164 to get his driver 's license , he checked the organ donor box without hesitation			0
at 23 , he was taking responsibility for his life and his family			0
he was going to school to become an electrician			0
he worked nights at @entity174 to provide for his 5 - year - old daughter , @entity175			0
he took his mom to @entity176			0
" he was moving up , " @entity9 says			0
" and it was cut short			0
" on march 25 , 2012 , @entity157 was goofing off with friends in a restaurant parking lot			0
he fell out of a car while the driver was doing donuts , and he hit his head			0
doctors kept him alive for six days before pronouncing him brain dead			0
a few days later @entity7 , received his first infusion of islet cells			1
two weeks later , he was off insulin			0
he looked down at his glucose monitor one day and saw a flat line for the first time in 30 years			0
" that was euphoria , " he says			0
he still wears his monitor to this day , enjoying the high looking at the flat line gives him			0
@entity7 sent a note to his anonymous donor 's family , thanking them for giving him a second chance at life			0
he then began speaking publicly about his transplant , urging the @entity72 to approve the procedure for others in the @entity205			1
" people need to be aware that this is an effective alternative treatment , " @entity136 said			0
" funding is very difficult to get for this kind of procedure in the @entity205 ; as a result , we 're falling behind other countries			0
" two human clinical trials are underway in the @entity205			1
once both are completed , researchers will submit the data to the @entity72 for review			1
@entity63 hopes in the next two to three years , all his and his colleagues ' hard work will pay off			0
only about 5 % of people with diabetes have @entity37 , according to the @entity224			1
islet cell transplantation can not help those with type 2 diabetes , @entity136 said , because they already produce insulin -- their bodies just have a greater resistance to the hormone			1
" i think that this procedure can definitely benefit some diabetics , but i do n't think it 's the panacea for every diabetic , " he said			1
saying thank you on june 1 , @entity7 met @entity9 at @entity239 in @entity130			1
she wore a @entity241 t - shirt to represent her son 's favorite @entity243 character			0
when she saw @entity7 , she waved her hand high in the air and had a flashback to the days when she used to do the same for @entity7 when he ran off in a crowd			0
the meeting was a mix of emotions for @entity7			0
" it 's a happy moment that i got the transplant , got to meet her , say thank you , " @entity7 remembers			0
" it 's a sad moment because having three children of my own , i ca n't imagine the pain			0
" but for @entity9 , it was therapeutic			0
she has n't heard from any of her son 's other recipients			0
" i 've told people , ' i know my son is dead , ' " she says			0
" but i know other people have his parts , so i know he 's still alive			0
@entity7 came to me at the right time			0
... i needed a hug from my son , and that 's what he was there for			0

islet cell transplantation might offer hope to patients with type 1 diabetes
patients who benefit are *struggling* with extreme blood sugar swings
scientists will complete two human clinical trials before submitting data to @entity72
