@entity0 , @entity1 -- police arrested a suspected top computer programmer for the @entity7 separatist group @entity6 in @entity8 tuesday , the @entity1 @entity3 said			1
the arrest comes a day after the separatist group 's latest cease - fire announcement			1
despite the group 's declaration of a permanent general and verifiable cease - fire , police will not stop pressuring @entity6 , the @entity3 said			1
the programmer is accused of playing a key role in the group 's logistics by designing the computer codes that operatives used to secretly communicate , the ministry said			1
police have been on the trail of the programmer for months , the ministry said			0
and authorities in @entity1 arrested the programmer 's girlfriend , also suspected of aiding @entity6 , according to the ministry			2
police are also investigating whether the programmer allegedly helped @entity33 @entity32 rebels with computer issues , but they have not confirmed a link with the leftist guerrilla group , the ministry said			0
in a statement released to the @entity7 newspaper @entity38 -- where it typically releases information -- @entity6 said monday that it declared a permanent general and verifiable cease - fire as a " firm commitment towards a process to achieve a lasting resolution and toward an end to the armed confrontation			1
" @entity1 interior minister @entity47 said that the government wants to see a statement from @entity6 calling for a definitive end , which he said monday 's statement did not do			2
" am i more tranquil today than before ? yes , " @entity52 said monday			0
" is this the end ? i would say no. " @entity1 's @entity55 government has repeatedly called for @entity6 to announce unilaterally a definitive end to its decades of separatist violence , blamed for more than 800 deaths , and a pledge to lay down its weapons			2
@entity6 wants @entity7 independence in northern @entity1 and southwest @entity8			1
various @entity7 leftist parties -- including the @entity64 party , outlawed for its links to @entity6 -- as well as four @entity67 peace laureates and the @entity68 also have called in recent months for the organization to establish a permanent and verifiable cease - fire			1
the @entity64 party 's ban from running candidates in municipal elections will not be lifted because of @entity6 's statement , the interior minister said			0
the latest statement comes after weeks of speculation in @entity1 that @entity6 would issue a statement during the holiday season			0
" it is time to act with historical responsibility			0
@entity6 calls upon those governing @entity1 and @entity8 to end all repressive measures and to leave aside for once and for all their position of denial towards the @entity88 , " the statement said			2
another part of the message said , " the solution will come through the democratic process with dialogue and negotiation as its tools and with its compass pointed towards the will of the @entity7 people			0
" " @entity6 will continue its indefatigable struggle and efforts to promote and to bring to a conclusion the democratic process until there is a truly democratic situation in the @entity88 , " it added			0
the organization has announced cease - fires before and broken them , notably its unilateral 2006 cease - fire that was announced as " permanent , " only to be broken months later with a car bomb at @entity0 's airport that killed two people			1
despite @entity6 's current cease - fire , in effect since september , the government has not eased up on the police pressure against @entity6 operatives in @entity1 and the organization 's hideouts in neighboring @entity8 and @entity119			1
in the past few years , police have arrested many of @entity6 's suspected top operatives , as well as many of its foot soldiers , and seized bomb - making materials and weapons from hidden arms caches , virtually shutting off @entity6 attacks			0
there are about 800 @entity6 convicts or suspects in prison , mainly in @entity1 but also in @entity8 , the @entity3 said recently			2
@entity6 is listed as a terrorist group by the @entity133 and the @entity134 for its campaign of car bombings and shootings			0
the @entity1 government of prime minister @entity139 began a peace process in 2006 during @entity6 's earlier unilateral cease - fire , but after the organization detonated an airport bomb , the government called off negotiations			1
since then , officials of @entity139 's government have said they would not accept another cease - fire , only a definitive statement from @entity6 that it would end its armed fight , and specifying when and where it would lay down its arms forever			2
the @entity7 region in northern @entity1 already has considerable home - rule authority , with its own police , parliament , taxing power and control of health and education			1
but @entity6 rejects those as partial steps , and has fought for full independence			0
@entity6 's goal is an independent @entity7 nation comprising the three - province @entity7 region and the neighboring @entity166 region in @entity1 , along with three departments in southwest @entity8 that also have @entity7 roots			1
about 3 million people live in those areas now			0
officials have said that in recent years , @entity6 has become weaker and more isolated from its traditional base of popular support .			0
