@entity0 the last hand in the " two thumbs up " film critic team , @entity4 , died thursday , two days after revealing cancer returned to his body			1
@entity4 and @entity9 co-hosted the iconic review show " @entity9 and @entity14 " until @entity9 's death in 1999 after a battle with a brain tumor			1
the @entity15 , the base of operations for @entity4 's syndicated reviews , announced his death at age 70			1
" we were getting ready to go home today for hospice care , when he looked at us , smiled , and passed away			2
no struggle , no pain , just a quiet , dignified transition , " his wife , @entity25 , said in a statement thursday			1
" i 'll see you at the movies , " were the last words @entity4 wrote to his readers			1
they were published in an essay titled " @entity36 " on his blog tuesday , in which he explained he was planning to slow down and reduce the number of movie reviews he wrote			1
" my intent is to continue to write selected reviews but to leave the rest to a talented team of writers handpicked and greatly admired by me , " @entity4 wrote			1
" what 's more , i 'll be able at last to do what i 've always fantasized about doing : reviewing only the movies i want to review			1
" @entity4 had already lost his voice and much of his jaw after battling thyroid and salivary gland cancer			1
he suffered a hip fracture in december , and it recently led to the revelations about cancer , he said			2
@entity4 started as the @entity15 film critic on april 3 , 1967 , writing about 200 reviews each of those 46 years , he said			1
the last year however , was his most prolific			2
" last year , i wrote the most of my career , including 306 movie reviews , a blog post or two a week , and assorted other articles , " he said			2
" i must slow down now , which is why i 'm taking what i like to call ' a leave of presence			2
' " @entity4 : the critical critic with an open mind @entity4 , who won a @entity69 for film criticism in 1975 , had a way with words and a sharp wit that is not easily matched			1
-- about @entity75 's " @entity74 : @entity76 " in 2005 : " if he 's going to persist in making bad movies , he 's going to -- have to grow accustomed to reading bad reviews			2
" -- concerning @entity75 's reaction to another critic who panned the film : " but @entity75 is correct , and @entity82 has not yet won a @entity69			1
therefore , @entity82 is not qualified to complain that @entity83 financed " @entity74 : @entity76 " while passing on the opportunity to participate in " @entity84 , " " @entity85 , " " @entity86 , " " sideways " and " finding neverland			2
" as chance would have it , i have won the @entity69 , and so i am qualified			0
speaking in my official capacity as a @entity69 winner , mr. @entity75 , your movie sucks			0
" two years later , flowers showed up at @entity4 's door with a card , signed " @entity99 , @entity75			1
" " the bouquet did n't change my opinion of his movie , but i do n't think he intended that , " @entity4 wrote			1
" it was a way of stepping back			0
it was a reminder that in the great scheme of things , a review does n't mean very much			0
sometimes when i write a negative review , people will say , ' i 'll bet you ca n't wait to hammer his next film			2
i would far rather praise the next film to show that i maintained an open mind			2
" -- a good example of @entity4 's willingness to keep an open mind comes from his review of @entity120 's 2001 comedy " @entity123 " of which he wrote one of his most scathing reviews : " this movie does n't scrape the bottom of the barrel			1
this movie is n't the bottom of the barrel			0
this movie is n't below the bottom of the barrel			0
this movie does n't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels			0
" but after watching @entity120 in " @entity134 " a year later , @entity4 revisited the film that he had awarded a rare zero stars : " but the thing is , i remember ' @entity123 ' more than a year later			1
i refer to it sometimes			0
and for all its sins , it was at least an ambitious movie , a go - for - broke attempt to accomplish something			0
it failed , but it has not left me convinced that @entity120 does n't have good work in him			0
anyone with his nerve and total lack of taste is sooner or later going to make a movie worth seeing			0
" -- reviewing " @entity154 " : " i 've seen audits that were more thrilling			0
" -- giving no love to " @entity156 : @entity156 " : " to say that @entity157 can not write a love scene is an understatement ; greeting cards have expressed more passion			0
" @entity4 : the film philosopher -- " every great film should seem new every time you see it			1
" -- " no good movie is too long and no bad movie is short enough			0
" -- " if you have to ask what it symbolizes , it did n't			0
" -- " if a movie is n't a hit right out of the gate , they drop it			0
which means that the whole mainstream @entity179 product has been skewed toward violence and vulgar teen comedy			0
" -- " i am utterly bored by celebrity interviews			0
most celebrities are devoid of interest			0
" @entity4 : remembered -- wife @entity25 : " i am devastated by the loss of my love , @entity4 -- my husband , my friend , my confidante and oh - so - brilliant partner of over 20 years			1
he fought a courageous fight			0
i 've lost the love of my life and the world has lost a visionary and a creative and generous spirit who touched so many people all over the world			0
we had a lovely , lovely life together , more beautiful and epic than a movie			0
it had its highs and the lows , but was always experienced with good humor , grace and a deep abiding love for each other			0
" @entity4 was a beloved husband , stepfather to @entity214 and @entity215 , and grandfather to @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220			2
just yesterday he was saying how his grandchildren were ' the best things in my life			0
' he was happy and radiating satisfaction over the outpouring of responses to his blog about his 46th year as a film critic			1
but he was also getting tired of his fight with cancer , and said if this takes him , he has lived a great and full life			2
" -- @entity238 president and ceo @entity237 : " @entity4 championed the art of the moving image and by the courage of his personal example demonstrated how much movies matter			1
@entity4 chaired the @entity238 jury of critics , filmmakers and scholars who selected the year 's 10 best films in 2004			1
he held the gavel that day with the same enthusiasm for excellence that made his voice a force in @entity251 popular culture			0
" -- @entity259 mayor @entity260 : " our whole city learned with sadness today of the passing of @entity4 , whose name was synonymous with two things : the movies and @entity259			1
in a @entity69 winning career that spanned more than four decades , thousands of reviews and countless acts of generosity to others , @entity4 championed @entity259 as a center for filmmaking and critiques			2
with a knowledge of his subject as deep as his love for his wife @entity273 , @entity4 will be remembered for the strength of his work , respected for his courage in the face of illness , and revered for his contribution to filmmaking and to our city			1
the final reel of his life may have run through to the end , but his memory will never fade			0
" -- @entity291 in chief @entity292 : " the long relationship between @entity4 and his @entity15 family speaks volumes about @entity4 's commitment to his craft and to his fans around the world			1
@entity4 's reviews were highly anticipated by readers and the film community			1
film commentary was only one of several gifts			2
he was a reporter first , in every aspect of his craft			0
he could write as eloquently about world affairs as he could on the upcoming blockbuster			0
@entity4 will be missed not only by the @entity15 family , but by the journalism and film communities			1
our thoughts are with @entity4 's wife , @entity273 , and their family during this time			1

" no struggle , no pain , just a quiet , dignified transition , " his wife says
@entity4 told readers tuesday he planned to slow down because of cancer
" i 'll see you at the movies , " were the last word 's @entity4 wrote to his readers
he started as the @entity15 film critic on april 3 , 1967
