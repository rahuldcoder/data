-- it was cloudy the afternoon of january 3 when residents say the cluster bombs fell on the @entity5 town of @entity6			1
three rockets containing the cluster munitions fell in nearby fields , apparently doing no harm , but a fourth landed on the street between residential buildings			0

fifteen civilians walking down the street or in their homes were wounded , including women and children , according to two residents and video evidence			0
residents said that an hour after the attack , a submunition that had failed to detonate on impact killed a man who tried to remove it from his yard			0
it exploded in his hands			0
since mid- 2012 , @entity38 and others have reported several times on civilian casualties caused by @entity5 use of air - dropped cluster bombs , but @entity6 and other recent attacks are the first known instances of @entity5 use of ground - based cluster munitions			1
the rockets were apparently launched from the vicinity of nearby @entity51 airport , which is under government control			0
evidence we have seen suggests that @entity5 government forces delivered the 122mm cluster munition rockets containing submunitions using a @entity59 multi-barrel rocket launcher , a truck - mounted system capable of firing 40 rockets nearly simultaneously with a range of 4 to 40 kilometers ( 2.5 to 25 miles )			1
grad rocket launchers are notorious for their inability to be accurately targeted due to their lack of a guidance system			0
this exacerbates the danger from the wide - area effect of the submunitions the rockets contain			0

each submunition is the size of a d - cell battery with a distinctive white ribbon , and the design of their fuze system makes each one very sensitive and liable to detonate if disturbed			0
after years of civilian harm caused by cluster munitions , @entity93 's massive use of the weapons in southern @entity76 in 2006 helped propel governments into action			0
working with civil society groups such as @entity38 and international organizations , a broad - based coalition of like - minded governments sought to do something to reduce the unacceptable harm caused by cluster munitions			1

a total of 111 nations , including many former users , producers , and stockpilers of the weapon , as well as countries contaminated by cluster munition remnants , have embraced the ban convention			0
yet there has been limited interest in the @entity126 and @entity127 regions , where just three countriesâ € ” @entity129 , @entity76 , and @entity131 € ” are onboard the treaty banning cluster bombs			1
some nations , such as @entity135 , say they need more time to study the convention 's provisions , while others including @entity139 , @entity140 , and @entity93 have produced , imported , exported , and stockpiled cluster munitions			0

@entity5 could have bought these cluster munitions from @entity139 , received them through military cooperation , or acquired them another way			1
with no transparency , it is impossible to say how or when they were made or transferred , though it is likely @entity5 acquired them long ago			1
@entity5 's relentless use of cluster munitions , including in populated areas , is yet another sign of its blatant disregard for international law and the protection of its own civilians			1
@entity5 's use of cluster munitions runs counter to the new international standard being created by the @entity170 , rejecting any use of the weapons			2
the preventive impact of the convention and the standard it is establishing can already be seen as countries that have joined the ban rapidly destroy their stockpiles of cluster munitions			2
in @entity5 , every time the government has used cluster munitions and other explosive weapons , a lethal legacy of unexploded ordnance is created			2
given the terrible humanitarian impact , all governments , regardless of their position on joining the ban convention , should press @entity5 to stop using cluster munitions			1
