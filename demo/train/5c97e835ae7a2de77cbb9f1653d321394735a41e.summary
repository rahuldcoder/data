@entity0 -- about half the schools in @entity3 did n't meet the annual yearly progress requirements of the @entity5 law last year			2
saying schools are struggling to meet the student progress requirements of the @entity5 law , the @entity7 announced monday it would be signing waivers that will relieve schools of some of the key provisions of the law			1
" the law -- @entity5 -- as it currently stands is four years overdue for being rewritten			2
it is far too punitive , it is far too prescriptive , lead to a dummying down of standards , lead to a narrowing of the curriculum , " education secretary @entity17 said at a @entity7 press briefing on monday			1
" we ca n't afford to have the law of the land be one that has so many perverse incentives or disincentives to the kind of progress that we want to see			0
" the law requires that all students meet reading and math adequacy by 2014			0
if they do n't , the schools are subject to reforms			0
as the standards have increased annually , schools are finding it increasingly difficult to meet them			0
" we hope that this is simply a transition or bridge to fixing the law , " @entity17 said of the waiver plans			1
rather than a large sweeping bill to reauthorize the entire @entity47 ( @entity47 ) , also known as @entity5 , rep. @entity45 's committee has been working on smaller , more specific bills throughout the summer , to address @entity47 concerns			1
the @entity51 - led @entity50 has passed three bills intended to streamline education programs , address charter school issues and give states and localities more flexibility in spending their federal dollars			1
these bills have not yet made it to the @entity7 floor for debate , nor have they come up in the @entity65 - led @entity64 for debate			1
only one of the bills -- the one on charter schools -- passed out of the @entity70 with bipartisan support			2
the committee is expected to take up separate legislation on teacher effectiveness and accountability this fall			0
" i remain concerned that temporary measures instituted by the @entity79 ) , such as conditional waivers , could undermine the committee 's efforts to reauthorize the @entity47 , " @entity45 , @entity76 , said in a statement friday			1
@entity17 said the @entity83 will announce the standards under which the waivers will be granted in september but in the meantime , they encourage all states to apply			1
@entity17 said he had talked to more than 30 governors about the waiver plan			2
" i have not spoken to one governor that was n't very enthusiastic about this , " he said			0
@entity3 applied for a waiver to the law late last month , according to @entity94 of the @entity83 there			0
without a waiver , @entity3 would be " responsible for intervening in a large number of its ' failing ' schools ; a role the department has neither the desire nor the capacity to take on , " according to @entity104			0
@entity3 is still waiting to see if @entity105 approves their request .			0
