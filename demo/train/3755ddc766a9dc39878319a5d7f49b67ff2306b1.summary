-- passengers on a @entity3 cruise ship drifting in the @entity4 are n't getting the vacation they expected -- sleeping on its decks , making do with a few working toilets , and doing what they can to get food -- all due to a weekend engine fire left the vessel dead in the water			1
the @entity13 was about 150 miles off the coast of @entity16 's @entity15 , heading back sunday morning to @entity17 , @entity18 -- where it had departed thursday on a four - day trip -- when a fire broke out in an engine room , according to @entity3			1
the ship 's automatic fire extinguishing system kicked in and soon contained the flames , and no injuries were reported , @entity3 reported			1
yet this fire left the ship -- and its 3,143 passengers and 1,086 crew members -- adrift without propulsion , the cruise line said , halting its trip back to port			1
the first of two tugboats that will tow the ship to @entity37 , @entity38 , arrived on monday evening , the cruise line said in a statement			1
the ship should arrive in the @entity4 city some time thursday			1
not being able to sail , though , is just one of the problems			2
issues with running water , scarce electricity and more contributed to headaches big and small , according to passengers and their loved ones			1
@entity50 's wife @entity49 told him there was " sewage running down the walls and floors " with passengers being asked to defecate in bags and urinate in showers due to a lack of functioning toilets			1
food lines ran 3Â½ hours long and some , like herself , slept outside to keep cool			0
" elderly and handicap ( ped people ) are struggling , " she texted her husband			0
" the smells are gross			0
" read related : cruise safety drill results in 5 deaths @entity68 said his wife , @entity70 -- who is on board , and whom he talked to sunday -- reported similar problems			1
" she said they had no power , no running water , and she said she had n't been able to eat anything yet			0
then you call the carnival phone number for families , and they tell you that everything is all right , " @entity68 told @entity0			2
posts to @entity83 , which bills itself as an " interactive community of avid and first - time cruisers , " documented similar issues with power and more			2
some posts , though , were more light - hearted			0
" they are all fine , " wrote one woman , whose sister is on board			0
" said they are still having fun and gave me the task to call her boss who seems to think i was lying			0
" carnival spokesman @entity98 acknowledged issues , while noting the cruise line 's efforts to address the situation			1
some people are camping out on the decks because some cabins do n't have air conditioning , he said monday evening			0
and @entity98 pointed to recent progress			2
for instance , " we have restored toilets in some public areas and cabins ; " there is running water for showers , even if it 's cold ; and some elevators are working			0
as for the food situation , he said the @entity13 's poolside restaurant has " limited food service " and meals have been brought aboard from two other carnival ships			1
earlier monday , the cruise line said in a statement that there was hot coffee available , among other options			2
" all our guests are safe , and we 're doing everything we can to make them as comfortable as possible , " carnival ceo @entity128 said in a statement issued at 8:30 p.m. et monday			2
" we 're terribly sorry for the inconvenience , discomfort and frustration our guests are feeling			0

" it 's in deep water and not near any hazards to navigation , " said @entity147 , the commander of the @entity148			0
the ship was initially expected to be towed into the northern @entity15 port of @entity154 , @entity16			1
but the ship had already drifted about 90 miles north due to strong currents by monday night , prompting the decision to instead move the @entity13 to @entity37			1
@entity3 said @entity37 and @entity154 were then roughly equidistant , adding that strong currents toward the @entity38 shore and a " simpler re-entry " -- especially for the 900 passengers without passports -- also drove the decision to head to the @entity164 coast			1
after being towed to port , those aboard the @entity13 will be flown home at no cost to them , the cruise line said			1
they will also get a full refund , credit that can be used toward a future trip and reimbursement for all expenses , except casino and gift shop purchases , for their current trip			0
the vessel 's next two departures , scheduled for monday and saturday , have been canceled			0
those slated to be on those trips will get full refunds and discounts toward future cruises , the cruise line said			2
@entity188 and friends of those on board may call 888 - 290 - 5095 or 305 - 406 - 5534 for information			0
throughout the ordeal , @entity50 said his wife @entity49 has kept her sense of humor despite being stranded			0
" i joked with her that i got the raw end of the deal			0
i was stuck in @entity18 with all ( the ) kids going to watch midget wrestling while she was on a cruise this weekend with her girlfriends , " he said			2
" when i talked to her ( sunday ) night , i reminded her maybe i got the better end of the deal , " he said			0
