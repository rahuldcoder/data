-- bolivians are widely expected to approve a new constitution sunday that would allow leftist president @entity3 to run for another term this year , which he ca n't do under the current document			1
the new constitution would eliminate term limits and allow president @entity3 to run again for president			1
the new constitution would replace the 1967 charter and give greater voice to the indigenous people who make up most of the country			1
it would also give more power to the central government			1
@entity20 , speaking at rallies in @entity18 and @entity19 this week , said the new document will propel the nation			0
" once approved , this will be the refoundation of @entity1 and the refoundation of a new state where there will be equality and we will all have the same rights and the same obligations , " he said			1
others say the referendum is a way for @entity20 to keep himself in power , a move that could plunge the country into further violence , division and uncertainty			1
that effort , critics say , is in ample evidence as some regions fight to break away and as the deaths of up to 30 peasant government supporters a few months ago led to accusations of a right - wing massacre			1
" what will be opened is a new chapter of violence , " said @entity50 , an investigator in @entity18 with the @entity51 , a policy institute associated with the @entity52			1
as campaigning on sunday 's referendum came to a close thursday with massive festive rallies for each side , @entity1 gave voice to the chasm that separates them			1
" what this constitutional project does is divide us , " said @entity61 , who was at the final opposition rally in the city of @entity64			0
" what it does is feed hate and racism in the country			0
" @entity73 , at a rally in favor of the new constitution , sees it from a different perspective			1
" for them , it 's division			1
it does n't benefit them , " he said			1
" but for humble people of our class , it serves us well			1
" the referendum has two parts : a straight yes - or - no vote on adopting the new constitution and a question asking @entity1 whether the maximum amount of private property that can be owned should be 5,000 or 10,000 hectares ( 12,355 or 24,710 acres )			1
the wide - ranging constitution would give the government a greater role in the economy and more control over natural resources , broaden nationalization of private industries and increase the rights of indigenous people			1
the new document also would eliminate term limits for all elected offices and would allow the president to run for re-election to a second consecutive five - year term			1
the current constitution limits the president to one five - year term			1
under provisions of the new constitution , current terms would not be counted , so @entity20 could run in december and in 2014			1
in return for support for the constitution , @entity20 reportedly has agreed not to run in 2014 if he wins this year			1
but @entity20 , who was elected in december 2005 by the largest margin since civilian rule was restored in 1982 , would still be in office for nine years			0
that part bothers those who see the vote as a way for @entity20 to keep himself in power			2
@entity129 , president of the @entity131 policy institute in @entity132 , warns against politicians " who use democracy to concentrate power			1
" sunday 's vote comes after a long and troubled path that saw the referendum postponed three times			2
@entity20 , who campaigned on a promise to change the constitution , convened a constitutional assembly in july 2006 , with a referendum scheduled for august 2007			1
the assembly did not have a draft document ready until december 2007			0
after much wrangling and accusations that opponents were locked out of crucial votes , the @entity1 congress approved a referendum in february 2008 , scheduling it for may			1
but the government suspended that vote in march because some of the nation 's nine departments , or states , wanted to hold local referendums on greater autonomy during the may balloting			2
in august , @entity20 said the referendum would be held in december			0
that vote also was postponed after unrest in @entity164 in which pro-government peasants were killed			0
in october , an agreement was reached to hold the referendum january 25 , 2009			0
@entity129 and others understand why many @entity1 are eager for the vote , particularly in a country with 85 percent indigenous or mestizo lineage and only 15 percent white			1
" there 's a certain amount of ethnic identity that 's involved			2
that 's really important , " said @entity176 , director of the @entity177 at the @entity178 in @entity132			2
" people believe that somehow this is going to translate into something positive for their lives			2
" a turning point came with the election of @entity20 , the nation 's first @entity186 president			1
" in @entity1 , you have a society that was very segregated , " @entity129 said			1
" there was a lot of repression against @entity186 groups			0
there 's a lot of impatience in the country			2
they feel that past governments have neglected them			0
they feel that the international communities and the @entity203 have ignored them			0
" @entity20 , who won a recall vote last summer by a two - thirds margin , also is eager for a vote			0
the referendum is as much about him as it is the constitution			2
" it 's a very important development , " said @entity210 , an analyst with the @entity211 , a political research and consulting firm			2
" @entity20 came into office with an agenda of radical change			2
the new constitution is an important step to consolidate this agenda			2
" analysts and everyday @entity1 agree that the referendum is nearly certain to pass			1
@entity176 notes that more than 100 new laws will be required to put the constitution into play			2
@entity210 points out that @entity20 had to compromise on many issues " as the result of a long and difficult negotiation			0
" more than 100 of the 411 articles in the constitution @entity20 ' party drafted in 2007 were changed as a result of negotiations with congress , @entity176 said			2
" the fact that @entity20 made concessions and made the constitution more moderate makes the constitution more resilient , " @entity210 said			2
he sees a couple of ways in which the opposition might try to make trouble for @entity20			0
" he 's going to get about two - thirds [ of the vote ]			2
that 's what 's expected , " @entity210 said			0
" if he gets lower , you could have more tension because the opposition will be emboldened			0
" if @entity20 gets significantly more of the vote than expected and tries to ram through his agenda , the opposition also could be energized , @entity210 said			0
@entity50 , the @entity18 investigator with the @entity51 , has a more dire forecast			0
" from monday on , " he said , " @entity1 wo n't know what to respect : what was before or what will come			1
this will destabilize the country			0
" he also thinks @entity1 's faltering economy may factor into sunday 's vote			1
the constitution was formulated , he said , " during a time of fat cows , but it is being voted on during a time of skinny cows			0
" though spirited , the campaign has been relatively trouble - free			0
about 3.8 million @entity1 are eligible to cast ballots in the mandatory voting			1
@entity272 , director of the @entity177 at the @entity273 , is head of a nine - person group of observers sent by former president @entity276 , who frequently monitors elections			0
the @entity279 has sent a 65 - person delegation , and the @entity281 has 45 observers , she said			0
" it 's fairly quiet now			0
it 's fairly calm , " she said friday			0
" there were some protesters			0
there was a little bit of rock - throwing			0
but there has been no real violence , no deaths			0
there 's more real calm than previous events in @entity1			1
" @entity129 agrees , to a point			0
" it 's a drama that 's playing itself out now , " he said			0
" the degree of polarization and friction does not leave me terribly optimistic			0
on the other hand , things have n't gotten out of hand			0
" @entity0 's @entity304 in @entity18 , @entity1 , contributed to this report .			1

new constitution would eliminate term limits , give more voice to indigenous people
some say it 's just way for president to keep himself in power
critics express concern that dramatic change could lead to violence , divisions
