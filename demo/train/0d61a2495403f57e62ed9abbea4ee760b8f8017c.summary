@entity0 of trash pile up for miles in @entity3 , a district of @entity4 that houses nearly 1 million people and is one of the poorest slums in the world			0
aluminum shanties fill the horizon , and an odor of urine cuts through the air			0
a man trots through the narrow , unpaved streets on a camel			0
if you make your way through this crowded maze , however , you will find the @entity20 , a free public school for girls and , recently , a few boys			2
peek in through the windows , and you 'll see a sight that seems incongruous next to the grimy chaos outside			0
in this school , where there is no electricity and temperatures often top 90 degrees , dozens of students in neat wool uniforms are sliding their fingers across touch screens , reading a lesson on their @entity39 e-reader			1
the students , who range in age from 14 to 20 , are cheerful , welcoming and quick to share the genres of books they like to read in both @entity44 and @entity45			1
their school is one of 28 participating in a program with @entity49 , a nonprofit organization based in @entity51 that provides modern technology -- usually @entity53 -- to improve literacy in the most impoverished parts of the world			1
by expanding access to education in areas where books are a scarce resource , the @entity49 team is trying to break the cycle of poverty , one electronic page at a time			1
for years , nonprofits , churches and donors have sent shipment after shipment of books to poor @entity73 villages in hopes of boosting literacy			1
but according to @entity77 , who founded @entity49 in 2010 with @entity78 , there 's a better way			1
" donating paper books to a place like @entity82 is well - intentioned , but it 's actually ill - informed , " @entity77 said			2
" you ca n't actually get the right books to the people you want to get to , at the time they need it			2
it 's very expensive and highly inefficient			0
" carrying heavy loads of books is not practical for @entity93 students who often have to walk miles to and from school			1
e-readers , however , are a different story			2
they 're lightweight and portable and give students access to entire libraries , including books from @entity73 publishers			1
to date , nearly 4,000 students in nine @entity73 countries have read more than 1.7 million e-books through @entity49			1
the e-readers give students access to a much greater variety of titles than they had access to without the devices			1
although many students had never used a computer before , they quickly learned how			2
a pilot program several years ago in @entity116 found that the @entity49 program boosted reading test scores for primary students by up to 7.6 % , although benefits for older students were less clear			1
in the beginning , @entity49 founders admit that they worried about theft			1
the students , after all , go home to a community filled with poverty			1
to their surprise , fewer than 1 % of the e-readers have gone missing			2
" books and education are really the way out of this , and people take great care of books and education , " @entity77 said			1
opening doors @entity140 , an 18 - year - old student who graduated from the academy last year and is now preparing for college , says the e-books she 's read have been an inspiration			0
" i read many stories ( about people ) who have been through many challenges , " she said			0
@entity140 says she has a new outlook on life after reading about people like herself who have overcome poverty to become successful			1
it 's a different way of life than what she sees in her neighborhood , where girls are often forced to marry young and education is considered a privilege			2
current student @entity161 , 8 , says she loves her @entity39 because it 's so light compared with the heavy books she used to carry to and from school			1
when she gets home , she often shares the device with her friends and family so they too can read			0
@entity161 says she wants to become a teacher			0
she knows that reading as many books as she can will help her pass the exams and follow her dreams			1
in other words , the @entity39 may be her key to a better life			0
@entity174 , executive director of the @entity20 , started the school to address gender inequality in the community by offering a free education to girls			1
he says there 's a long waiting list to get in because in @entity93 , education and textbooks are very expensive			1
@entity174 believes that the e-readers are the best thing that has ever happened to his school and his students ' educations			1
" that 's why the @entity39 is very important , " he said			0
" it means their life			0
" @entity174 says he 's seen dramatic improvements in reading ability and comprehension among his students with @entity53			1
his wish is for every student and every teacher to one day have an e-reader			0
in a country where leaders are pushing for more technology for students ( in 2013 , @entity93 president @entity201 pledged to provide free laptops to all schoolchildren ) , a @entity39 may be a more practical solution			1
the device can hold a charge for two weeks when @entity210 is turned off , which is a boon in areas where electricity is scarce			0
@entity49 relies on donations and gets its kindles at cost			2
through a discounted deal with shipping company @entity219 , the e-readers arrive in @entity82 loaded with books and fully charged			2
most schools in the program have a room with outlets in case power runs low			0
@entity49 tailors the contents of each e-reader to the needs of specific schools and classes			2
@entity77 says he 's in constant communication with the schools , collecting and tracking data to learn what works and what does n't			0
as @entity77 sees it , it 's not enough to just provide books ; they must provide books that students want to read			2
future success @entity78 , @entity49 's president , says that continued involvement in schools is vital to the future success of the program			1
" nonprofits that drop technology into communities usually find that the community 's habits and culture are far stronger than the technology , so after some time -- a few months , a few years -- nobody is using the technology anymore , " he said			0
" so what we do is n't just send a product to people			0
we 're creating a system that brings publishers , e-reader manufacturers , teachers , children and communities together so that everyone can read more			0
we hope that not only will we improve millions of lives but also create habits and structures that endure for many years			0
" students do n't have to have an e-reader to benefit from @entity49			1
the organization also created an app that allows students to read books on their cell phones ( cell phone penetration is as high as 80 % in developing countries ; in @entity93 , cell towers are everywhere )			1
the app makes learning even more portable and has been downloaded more than 335,000 times			0
" many people do n't think you can engage and read on such a small screen , but we have reams of data that proves this , " @entity77 said			0
" people are reading for hours on end , not only starting books but completing them			2
" by working with @entity73 publishers , @entity49 ensures that the content students receive is culturally relevant			1
that makes the books easier for the kids to relate to and is a change from a time when schools had to rely on donors for reading material , no matter how far afield it was ( " @entity304 , " for example			2
) @entity305 , chairman of the @entity306 , has worked with @entity49 for the past three to four years			2
he believes that getting books to @entity93 as cheaply and easily as possible is one of the most important things he 's achieved			1
" most of the population lives below $ 1 a day			0
most books are $ 4 to $ 5			0
suddenly , we are able to unveil thousands of books costing much lower -- maybe cents			0
that makes a big difference , " he said			0
" the most gratifying thing was to see a child with no shoes but reading an e-reader to other children			0
that , to me , was probably the best day of my life			0

a nonprofit called @entity49 brings e-readers to students in poor countries
the devices are lightweight and allow students to access *hundreds* of books
a @entity93 school says the e-readers have helped improve reading comprehension
