editor 's note : the rev. @entity2 is president and founder of the @entity4			2
he began his theological studies at the @entity6 and deferred his studies when he began working full - time in the @entity8 with dr. @entity9 rev. @entity9 received his master of divinity degree in 2000			1
next week : rev. @entity11 writes about his campaign to eliminate debt as senior pastor of @entity15 of @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18			2
he is featured in @entity20 's " @entity19 : a black in @entity21 " which premieres october 21			0
my faith tradition has always been inextricably bound with the tradition of the civil rights movement			1
the blood , sweat and tears of " the movement " have run through my life ; they touched and entangled me with an indelible spirit of never giving up , always trying to serve			2
through the good and hard times , i lean on my faith to help me traverse the twists and turns of life			1
i grew up with two strong parents who believed in the literal sense and spirit of the @entity41 that required and mandates prayer in all circumstances			0
they prayed daily and instilled that belief in me			0
they were faithful to our local church			0
my parents participated in all aspects of the church work including tithing , which enabled us to build what we could with what we have and @entity57 's help			0
i learned very early in life " with @entity57 all things are possible			0
" as i navigated through the south as a youth , and in particular a college student , i was thrust into the civil rights movement			1
racism was alive and well in the segregated @entity65 , present in every facet of our lives			0
it was a " dual society " socially , where blacks could not sit at the same lunch counters as whites , sat at the back of the bus , and were denied equal access to public accommodations ; and also economically , where @entity79 - @entity78 had little , if any , direct participation in the financial life of the nation			2
seeing the inequities in all aspects of our lives greatly challenged me to seek another way , a better way			0
i learned through the teaching of dr. @entity9 and his contemporary dr. @entity90 that our plight as a people was like that of a symphony			1
i came to conceptualize our cause and termed it the " @entity97 " -- our freedom song to democratic , economic empowerment			1
symphonies are constructed in four movements			2
the first movement was the fight to end slavery -- a tumultuous upheaval battling the dehumanization of @entity78			1
slavery fueled the global trade markets and the industrialization of @entity110			2
it was an economic system that confined blacks to work without wages , and it involved total subjugation to the master			0
the second movement was our quest to dismantle @entity119 and tear down ancient walls of legal segregation that prevented equal , democratic participation in @entity110 's social , political and economic life			1
but the legacy of decades of slavery and @entity119 segregation left blacks in a state of inequality			1
economic inequalities -- two @entity131 -- remained a fact of life			0
the third movement was our fight for the right to vote , to open the voting process to all african - americans as well as create and institute new legislation such as the @entity140 to ensure and protect the rights of all voters			1
our fourth movement of the @entity97 represents the unfinished business of our movement			1
we are free , but not equal			0
our fight for economic justice , access to capital , industry and technology remains at the forefront of today 's agenda			0
this fourth movement is one that i believe will take us beyond the margins so that all can participate in the prosperity of our nation			1
my last days with dr. @entity9 and dr. @entity90 were filled with watching them motivate and move our nation toward a more perfect union			1
we must be guided by their faith and spurred to social action to ensure that we have equal access to capital , unfettered economic development in urban communities and fair and equitable professional financial services which includes deal flow and fee structure			1
my faith inspires me to continue to do this work			0
but faith without works is dead			1
and so we tackle today 's financial calamity - one that now finds us grappling with an ever spiraling cycle of unemployment , home foreclosures and rising student loan debt			0
it is here where faith and works meet			2
and it is upon this philosophy that i seek to serve my @entity57 and our world			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the rev. @entity2			0

rev. @entity9 says faith must be *accompanied* by good works on earth
he says *journey* of african - americans to freedom has four movements
first movement is *emancipation* from slavery , second is end of @entity119
third movement is voting rights and fourth is economic prosperity , he says
