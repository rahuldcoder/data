: a trade show for the mobile industry to show off its latest phones , tablets , apps and services			1
it 's the biggest show for mobile technology , and as mobile is so hot right now , it 's arguably the most important show in tech overall			1
most companies use it as the platform to set out their agenda for the year and give us a taste of the innovations we can expect to see , but there 's a more practical reason why this show matters so much to the companies exhibiting there			1
there is a brutal war going on right now for new smartphone and tablet customers , with @entity33 and @entity34 winning			1
according to research firm @entity35 , @entity34 and @entity33 now have more than half the worldwide smartphone market between them			2
that makes it vital for all the other major hardware players to have a good @entity4 , or risk irrelevance			1
here 's what i 'm expecting to see : better camera phones photography will be a big theme of @entity49 and @entity50 's launches			2
@entity49 generated the biggest buzz at last year 's @entity4 with its @entity53 camera phone , a model with an unbelievably high 42 - megapixel camera sensor			1
@entity56 reviewed it after the show was finished , and we loved the camera , but found the @entity62 operating system it ran lacking			2
this year , @entity49 watchers are hoping it will put the same camera technology on a @entity66 phone , which should make it a much more compelling product			2
the @entity66 phone platform could certainly do with that sort of boost -- so far , sales have n't exactly set the world alight			1
@entity50 also really needs a hit right now , and it 's taking no chances by holding its @entity4 press conference a week before the show actually starts to make sure someone else 's shiny gadget does n't blast it off the news agenda			1
to tease its announcement on tuesday 19 , the company has released an infographic called " a brief history of photography "			0
it does n't give much away , but the inference is that phone manufacturers have been focusing on increasing the number of megapixels in camera phones , rather than picture quality			0
we 'll know more very shortly			0
bigger screens large screens are set to dominate : if leaked pictures of various handsets are to be believed , many vendors will be showing off phones with 5 - inch screens with a 1080p resolution -- the same number of pixels you get on a high - definition tv			2
even a 5 - inch screen is n't enough for some people			0
@entity33 single - handedly created a new product category , the " phablet , " in 2011 with its @entity110			0
this phone / tablet hybrid combines a near 6 - inch screen with a pen and has sold in the millions			0
everyone is going to want a piece of this action at @entity4			1
a game - changing tablet ? one product area i 'm hoping will see some development at @entity4 is tablets			1
no one has made the perfect tablet yet : the @entity125 is a great product , but it 's limited and i find myself having to use a computer to perform certain tasks			1
@entity66 8 tablets are interesting and experimental , but no one has nailed it			0
the field is still wide open for a company to create a single product that can replace a traditional laptop and an @entity125 - style tablet			0
@entity49 is working on one , although i doubt it will reveal it at @entity4			1
@entity33 used last year 's show to show off tablets operated with a pen , so we 'll probably see some more of those			1
but i 'm keeping my fingers crossed for a smaller player , perhaps a company like @entity145 , to show the rest of the world how it should be done			0
@entity149 's mobile os speaking of smaller players , @entity149 , makers of the @entity152 web browser , is creating a mobile phone operating system and is expected to show off the hardware it will run on at its press conference			1
i 'm not sure the world needs another mobile operating system : if @entity162 is struggling to get traction with @entity164 against the might of @entity34 's @entity166 and @entity168 's @entity167 , what chance does @entity149 have ? but for gadget fans like me , it 's always good to have something new to talk about			1
on the services side , i 'm going to be looking for anything that takes advantage of the @entity176 internet connections that are slowly being rolled out across @entity177			0
the promise of the speed 4g offers is that our phones will be able to do many more things			0
but so far , companies have had difficulty saying what they actually will be , beyond faster web browsing and downloading video			0
a couple of things we wo n't see : @entity33 wo n't unveil a successor to its wildly popular @entity191 at @entity4			1
that will come at its own dedicated event later in the year so it can maximize the chatter around it			0
and although we will hear a lot about apps for @entity34 's @entity202 , @entity34 itself wo n't exhibit			0
here comes @entity203 my final tip is to watch out for @entity203			0
you might not see them much in phone shops , but the @entity210 mega-corp wants to dominate the @entity212 market			0
@entity35 put @entity203 as the number three in the world in terms of smartphone shipments			0
at @entity56 , we 've seen interest in the brand increase by over 800 % in a year , based on our internal data , as it released a series of cheap @entity167 phones that were actually rather good			2
@entity4 will see it try and build on that success and expand into the high end			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			2

@entity4 ( @entity4 ) is the year 's biggest trade show for the mobile industry
most companies use it as the platform to set out their agenda for the year
there is a brutal war going on for new smartphone and tablet customers
