-- " why not eat insects ? " asked @entity1 , a 19th century @entity2 author in his eccentric treatise on changing the @entity5 diet			2
" why should these creatures be called loathsome ... they are in every way more fitted for human food than many of the so - called delicacies now highly prized , " he wrote in " @entity7 ? " published in 1885			2
grubs and bugs , believed @entity1 , were better than crabs and lobsters ( " foul creatures " that feed on " putrid flesh " ) and if embraced by " the working man " also could alleviate malnutrition and rural poverty			0
despite his prediction that the day will come " when the slug will be as popular in @entity25 as the sea - slug is in @entity27 , " he did n't manage to convince @entity28 @entity2 to give up their meat and veg for slimy or six - legged livestock			2
however , modern palates might now be ready to accept a serving of insects , as appetites grow for healthy and environmentally - sensitive foods across the globe			1
insects are high in protein , vitamins and minerals like calcium , zinc and iron -- something that a few @entity46 and @entity47 food start - ups have realized , with new offerings such as insect energy bars			1
yet while still niche and generally seen as an exotic novelty for foodies in the west , in other parts of the world bugs do n't have the same " ewww ! " factor			2
edible insects have long been a staple part of diets in many parts of @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 , and @entity66 is one country where bug farming has become a growing business over the last 15 years			1
it leads the world in insects for food production , averaging around 7,500 tons per year , according to a 2013 report by the @entity75 's @entity74 ( @entity74 )			1
that 's still tiny compared to the country 's chicken production ( around 1.6m tons per year ) , but insects hold a number of advantages over traditionally farmed animals			1
" mini-livestock " could be key to combating future global food shortages , suggests the @entity74 , as insects are relatively easy to raise and have a minimal impact on the environment compared to conventional cattle			1
according to the @entity74 , to produce one kilo of edible crickets , only two kilograms of feed are needed , compared to five kilograms of feed for a kilo of pork and ten kilograms of feed for one kilo of beef			2
across @entity66 there are around 20,000 insect farming enterprises producing 200 edible insect species , the most popular type being crickets , grasshoppers , palm weevil larvae and bamboo caterpillars			1
the @entity65 financial crisis in 1997 precipitated the rise of commercial insect farming in @entity66			1
the return of jobless workers to the northeast of the country was a concern that @entity113 , co-author of the @entity74 report and associate professor in entomology from @entity117 , decided to address head on			0
" we went to rural areas to train people how to grow crickets so at least they were guaranteed food for consumption			2
" the long - standing tradition of eating wild crickets meant no cultural barrier to eating insects had to be overcome and a new industry could be nurtured			1
the main challenge was providing enough training to scale up farms and create high standards in agricultural practice			2
more needs to be done to create a well - managed , sustainable industry , says @entity113 , but " fifteen years ago you would never have seen insects being sold in supermarkets like you do today			0
" international enterprises have begun to set up processing and packaging operations in @entity66 for export , and last week @entity144 supermarket chain @entity143 announced it will sell insect products in its stores from next year			1
however in @entity66 , most of the demand is domestic			1
for @entity113 , the key to keeping cricket farms growing and promoting insects as food internationally is for farmers to diversify their products			1
@entity155 , director of @entity156 , a @entity2 - based food start - up , agrees			0
" the @entity46 mindset is generally that insects are icky , " he says			0
for that reason the company is developing products like insect seasoning and " croquettes " for a potential commercial release next year			0
currently they source their insects from an organic collective in @entity169			0
" making the products like this should make it easier for @entity176 palates to accept , " says @entity155 , who adds that what you feed an insect affects how it tastes			0
@entity179 's pop - up restaurant in south @entity180 last year was an enlightening experience for @entity155 and his colleagues			0
a far cry from @entity1 's vaunted " slug soup , " the company served up a range of dishes including insect risottos and insect medallions			0
" most people are very disconnected from where their food is from , they generally do n't want to see something on their plate that resembles the animal it 's from			0
" @entity0 's @entity198 series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile			0
however @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0

insects could be a *valuable* food of the future as global population *increases*
high in nutrients , they are also more environmentally *friendly* than traditional livestock
@entity66 leads the world in edible insect production
cultural *antipathy* could be overcome by product diversification , *proponents* say
