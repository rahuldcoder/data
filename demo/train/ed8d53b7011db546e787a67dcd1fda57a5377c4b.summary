@entity0 -- attorneys for the family of a 9/11 victim said they will push forward with a wrongful death lawsuit against @entity6 and a private security company despite a federal judge 's decision to dismiss the @entity10 from the suit			1
the lawsuit , originally filed in @entity14 federal court , alleges that @entity10 , @entity6 and security company @entity15 were responsible for the security breaches that led to the death of @entity18 , 31 , who was aboard @entity19 when it crashed into the @entity22 's @entity21 on september 11 , 2001			1
@entity23 , an attorney for @entity18 ' family , said that wednesday 's dismissal of @entity10 -- the agency that owns and operates @entity28 -- from the lawsuit was a disappointment , but that it narrows the case 's focus around security on the airplane itself			1
" it will be very targeted to @entity6 , " he said of the lawsuit			1
" @entity6 failed wholesale at keeping the @entity38 public safe			2
" the suit claims that security screeners at @entity28 had trouble communicating in @entity42 , were unable to detect weapons such as the chemical spray @entity45 , and were operating under a general manager who was unaware of the @entity48 terrorist threat			1
" this was a tragic event and we are actively working to resolve this case , " said @entity6 spokeswoman @entity49			2
from the start , the defendants have said they are not liable for the attacks			0
@entity10 filed a motion to dismiss in may , claiming that the @entity59 regulations for screening passengers and their baggage was the airline 's responsibility , not the airport 's			2
@entity10 was dismissed from the suit on wednesday			0
" the entire @entity28 airport community will forever carry in its heart the events of september 11 , 2001 , " said @entity10 interim ceo @entity66 in a statement released after the dismissal			2
" our thoughts and prayers will always be with the victims of that tragic day and their families			0
" the @entity18 family is one of 96 families who opted not to settle through the september 11th @entity79 , @entity23 said			0
their lawsuit , which is the last remaining suit brought by family members of 9/11 victims , was filed in 2002			1
" there are lessons that can be learned from this and they want those lessons to be viewed and not buried , " @entity23 said			0
the trial is set to start november 7			0
