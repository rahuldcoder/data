-- resolving domestic disputes between elephants and humans is an age old problem , but one not - for - profit organization based in @entity7 thinks it may have a solution			1
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) is encouraging local farmers to burn briquettes of chili to ward off the stomping giants			1
it 's a technique that @entity15 , director of the @entity9 , said is very effective given the elephant 's delicate sense of smell			2
in an interview with @entity0 , he said : " the hot chili peppers are very distasteful to elephants because of their advanced olfactory systems			1
they pick up things in the environment that we have no idea about			0
" " chilies really irritate them and cause a very short term , very painful experience for them that goes away , " he added			0
but although the @entity35 may cause some discomfort to the elephants in the short term , it is the lesser of two evils , notes @entity15			2
the longstanding conflict between farmers and elephants is devastating both sets of communities			1
farmers sometimes kill elephants in an effort to protect their crops while the latter decimate food and grain stores , occasionally injuring or killing humans and livestock			1
what 's more -- farmers are bearing the costs of living with elephants and receive little of the benefits , says the @entity9			1
even where community - based conservation initiatives exist , and elephants generate large revenues , the money does n't filter down to local population			2
@entity15 said that creating an environment where people and elephants can live in harmony is key , but that does n't necessarily mean taking a conventional approach to conservation			2
and that 's where the chilies come in			0
" the problem with conservation in general , it does n't produce anything			0
there 's not really much you can sell from conservation of birds in a forest , " says @entity15			0
" so we thought , if we could get people to grow these chilies to deter the elephants from coming into the fields , buy it back , grind it up and sell it internationally to tell the story about what we 're doing but also give a high end market for @entity91 products -- maybe we could be a model for other programs			2
" the @entity9 's work is more important than ever as elephant and human populations have significantly increased in southern @entity96 in recent years , explains @entity15			1
according to the @entity99 , elephant numbers have reached 300,000 in @entity96 , however , less than 20 % of the elephant range is under formal protection			1
and while tolerant of human disturbance to some degree , elephants are unable to survive when the landscape becomes dominated by farmland			0
@entity15 said : " the world wants to know more about where [ our ] food is coming from , so having a great story to it really was a powerful thing ... i think our kids are going to be very much more interested in that kind of stuff than our generation is now			0
" the @entity9 currently sells the farmed chilies through a website called ' @entity9 ' with a slogan : " @entity121 ... we love elephants			0
" @entity15 is hopeful that programs such as the one run by the @entity9 will help to spur investment on a continent - wide scale and attract entrepreneurs , who want to set up businesses in the country rather than just provide revenue through aid			0
" @entity96 needs the business minds of the people ... to come and spend money here , " he said , " you can create 50 jobs without even blinking because labor is relatively cheap ; you can have a labor intensive project			1
" @entity15 , a @entity140 native , believes that entrepreneurs must move to @entity96 to make money and not purely for philanthropic reasons			1
" we should n't come here with that attitude , " he says			0
" people need jobs here and they need jobs of reasonable pay ... if your long term goal is to save these animals , there 's got to be something far more creative than what we 're currently doing			0
