@entity0 , @entity1 -- if the location is anything to go by , then the omens are promising			1
@entity7 's capital city , @entity8 -- host to the @entity11 climate summit which starts today -- is already one of the greenest cities in @entity14			1
with over 300 kilometers of cycle lanes it is estimated that around 40 percent of the 1.2 population travel to work on a bicycle			2
and visitors to the city are encouraged to join in by making use of the network of city bikes for a deposit of just 20 dkk ( $ 4 )			2
the influence of two wheels has extended into yuletide this year , as cyclists in @entity29 are generating the electricity powering the lights on the christmas tree			2
it 's just one of hundreds of activities and events which @entity36 have organized to coincide with the 11 - day @entity11 summit taking place at the @entity39 in the @entity41 district in the southeast of the city			1
the opening of the summit marks the end of an exhaustive planning period by the city			1
preparations at the @entity39 began two years ago			2
the finishing touches began eight weeks ago			2
" it is , by far , the largest conference we have ever held and the largest political conference in @entity14 , " the @entity39 press manager , @entity51 told @entity2			1
" if numbers continue to grow , it will be the biggest political meeting the @entity11 has ever held , " he said			1
the center has hosted big events before -- a @entity61 summit in 2002 and the 2006 @entity62 -- but the @entity11 summit makes them look like a tea party			1
" a conference is 36 hours			2
this is 11 days , " @entity51 said			2
the @entity39 has had to extend its floor space to 77,000 square meters -- the size of 11 football pitches -- to accommodate all delegates and 1000 staff will be on hand throughout			2
numbers are expected to peak at around 18,000 in the second week when 100 heads of state arrive for the high - level political negotiations			1
this herculean effort of planning is being backed up by a raft of green initiatives			2
outside the conference center solar - powered streetlights are helping light the car parks			0
a wind turbine is helping power the lights indoors			0
inside the conference center delegates will eat from a menu that is 65 percent organic and drink water that has come out of a tap rather than a bottle			0
pens provided will be made from recycled plastic , and even the carpets are biodegradable			0
in a bid to offset the considerable carbon dioxide emissions - estimated to be 40,000 tons -- generated by the summit , organizers are funding the replacement of polluting brick factories in @entity101 , @entity102 with 20 new efficient ones			1
despite the disruption , @entity36 have gone about their daily business as usual			0
@entity108 , editor of @entity109 , a weekly @entity107 language newspaper told @entity2 : " there has n't been much of a build up until the last few days			0
until about two weeks ago it 's not been talked about a lot in the press and maybe a month ago half the people in @entity7 did n't know there was going to be a conference , " he told @entity2			1
people are starting to notice changes now , and the mood among @entity36 is positive , apart from the locals living near the @entity39 and whose lives have been disrupted by all the security arrangements , @entity108 said			0
the concrete barriers and the perimeter fence erected to protect the @entity39 have been one of the more obvious signs of security in the city			0
and now that the conference has started , 6000 officers will be on duty during the conference			0
@entity133 , communications advisor to the @entity7 national police commissioner , told @entity2 : " it is the single greatest operation that the @entity7 police have undertaken			1
police are being drafted in from all over the country , and shifts are being extended from eight to 12 - 16 hours			0
" in all , the security operations are costing the @entity7 government an estimated $ 122 million			1
last week , police unveiled a 22 - ton vehicle armed with a water canon which will be used if trouble flares during the conference			0
the only confrontations in the buildup to the conference have been between @entity8 's female mayor , @entity149 , and the city 's prostitutes			1
a row started after city leaders requested hotels display postcards saying : " be sustainable : do n't buy sex			0
" the prostitutes -- whose are free to work under @entity7 law -- have responded by offering their services free of charge			1
" our office is based in the red - light district			0
there are prostitutes here , but it 's not like @entity166 , " @entity108 explained			0
" i think some people coming to the conference think it might be			0
so the city council have been trying to pre-empt it by sending postcards saying please refrain from going to these areas			0
the sex workers have responded by saying that 's ridiculous			0
they see this as their big moment			0
" as @entity8 hands over to the @entity11 for two weeks , the world 's eyes are now turning to negotiations which precede the arrival of @entity183 president @entity182 and company			1
earlier this year , @entity8 announced the aim of being carbon neutral by 2025			1
perhaps the @entity11 could take a leaf out of their host 's book .			1
