@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the dark of the early morning , the assembled drug agents murmur a short prayer before setting out on an early morning drugs raid			1
a agent torches marijuana plants found in the @entity1 forests but there could be hundreds more farms			1
after a few short orders , we set off into the deep undergrowth of southern @entity1 's forests on a tip - off that somewhere ahead are hidden farms illegally growing cannabis			1
" it 's dangerous because some of them have machetes and in the deeper forest they have pump action shotguns that they use , " explained @entity19 , @entity1 's narcotics commander for @entity0			1
@entity1 's @entity26 , or @entity26 , are battling to stop drugs illegally transited through the country , from @entity29 and @entity30 into @entity31 and the @entity32 , spilling over into the streets of @entity1			1
as we approach the farm , orders go for out for silence and torches out			0
the agents spill into an opening in the dense forest , and in the red - glow of the rising sun we can make out the unmistakable leaf of the marijuana plant			2
@entity26 suspects there may be hundreds of farms hidden in the forest - estimating the crop they 've found this morning to be about $ 6,000			1
despite @entity26 's efforts the farmers are nowhere to be seen , but commander @entity19 remains practical			0
" the people that stay in these farms are not the big people			2
the big men stay in the cities -- they do n't even come to the farmlands			0
" @entity1 is on the frontline in the global war on drugs -- an international gateway for cocaine from @entity29 and heroin from @entity30 to abusers in @entity31 and the @entity32			1
it 's not known exactly how much is transited through @entity1 but @entity26 says last year they seized over 300 tons of narcotics			1
focusing primarily on the main transit points -- roads , ports and airports - @entity26 claim to have convicted over 1,800 traffickers			0
most of them are @entity1			2
" we do have a big expatriate community of @entity1 in @entity31 and @entity32 , " explains @entity74 at the @entity75 on @entity76 in @entity1			2
" and there is always the danger that these communities are tapped into by organized crime cartels			0
" we spoke to one man arrested for trying to trafficking cocaine to @entity31			2
a young graduate , he explained how after losing his job in @entity87 he was tempted by the offer of $ 5,000 to transport cocaine packets in his stomach			1
" when you are swallowing - taking in this thing into your body it 's just as if you are signing your death warrant ... but this is what many youths do today just to make a living			2
" and with low - ranking @entity26 officers paid on average $ 200 a month corruption within the agency is a key concern			1
" yes , certainly there was a lot -- a lot , i think -- of corruption in the agency , " explained @entity104 , the agency 's chairman			0
" but so long as i continue as chairman of the agency , so long i will continue to dismiss anybody who 's involved in corruption -- i will never spare him			0
" but neither do the drugs			0
living under a bridge in @entity1 's over-crowded metropolis , @entity120 , @entity117 sleeps behind a public toilet with five other people			1
she prostitutes herself to pay for her cocaine habit			2
" cocaine has destroyed my life - if it was not for the cocaine i 'm taking , i would not be in such a place because i 'm a learned somebody			1
my parents spent a lot to make sure i go to school , but because of cocaine i 've ruined everything			0
" @entity117 is being helped by one of only a handful of drug rehabilitation centers in @entity120 -- @entity135			0
but struggling to find funding to cope with the number of addicts , their founder @entity136 is seeing a disturbing trend			0
" i actually think its increasing -- in the past few years we 've seen more cases of heroin and cocaine abuse and in the area of marijuana it 's like its getting even more common			0
" watching his officers systematically set about cutting and burning the seized cannabis crop commander @entity19 gestures to the flames			0
" we prefer to get to the grass roots and cut it down before it gets to the streets			0
" but with the farmers and drug barons still in hiding @entity1 's drug war is far from over .			1
