@entity1 , @entity0 -- the past month has been the worst for the @entity3 in @entity4 since the war began after the attacks of september 11 , 2001			1
there have been more difficult periods of combat against the @entity10 , @entity11 and other insurgents			0
there have been more fragmented and confused moments in allied strategy			0
there has , however , never been a time when @entity3 soldiers acted with such obvious and offensive disrespect for @entity4 citizens			1
the past month has witnessed a string of incidents , including the alleged killing of 16 civilians by a @entity3 soldier and the burning of @entity27 , the holiest touchstone of the @entity30 faith , at a @entity32 air base			1
the @entity3 has crossed a self - defeating threshold in @entity4 where our soldiers are seen as attacking the very people and culture they are deployed to protect			1
we are destroying villages in order to save them			0
we have witnessed this dynamic before			0
in early 1968 , it became apparent that @entity3 soldiers in @entity44 were fighting a stubborn communist enemy without the support they expected from @entity44 citizens			2
to the contrary , residents of @entity44 frequently gave assistance to the insurgents killing @entity3			2
frustrated and desperate , particularly after the @entity52 in january 1968 , @entity3 soldiers took the war to the population with devastating consequences			1
counterinsurgency warfare meant burning rural villages , bombing crowded areas and killing innocent civilians			2
the @entity60 of march 16 , 1968 , was the most notorious example , but it was not unique			0
after failing to catch insurgents who fled the village , angry @entity3 soldiers killed more than 300 women , children and elderly residents in cold blood			1
the @entity3 was massacring the same @entity44 it was fighting to save			0
we do not know what motivated the @entity3 soldier who is accused of going house - to - house , murdering @entity4 families , on sunday			1
based on the patterns of the past month , the question arises : was he acting in ways that echo @entity60 ? the @entity3 military might be the strongest fighting force in the world , but it is still a collection of emotional and fragile human beings who react to the circumstances , pressures and incentives around them			2
as in @entity89 more than 40 years ago , the @entity3 soldiers in @entity4 are fighting a war against an elusive enemy amidst a population that is increasingly resistant to @entity3 demands for assistance			1
@entity4 citizens know that the @entity3 is planning to leave soon , and they sense that the @entity3 they meet care more about an " exit strategy " than the welfare of their society			1
@entity4 intransigence furthers the frustration and resentment among @entity3 soldiers , fueling violent behavior directed at innocent civilians			1
this self - defeating cycle reflects specific policies			0
president @entity107 has acknowledged the corrupt @entity4 leadership of @entity109 , but he is doing nothing serious about it			0
the @entity3 government has told its more than 80,000 troops in @entity4 that they must help create a stable and secure @entity4 nation , despite rampant corruption , in less than a year			1
young @entity3 soldiers are under enormous pressure , in hostile circumstances , and they are increasingly isolated from support networks within the @entity3			2
for all the talk of " supporting the troops , " the @entity4 war receives little serious attention in @entity3 public debate			1
@entity107 rarely mentions the war , and his @entity126 challengers say little about it either			0
the @entity3 soldiers in @entity4 are under orders to do the impossible at light speed , and they are ignored by their fellow citizens			1
we have re-created the conditions of extreme stress , isolation and victimization that were evident in @entity44			0
we have turned a frustrating war into a breeding ground for @entity3 atrocities			1
this is what happens when our national leaders try to fight a war and exit a war at the same time			0
we can not do both			0
our soldiers can not build a functioning nation when they are told that we are not doing nation - building			0
they can not defeat an enemy when we refuse to engage fully			0
they can not work peacefully with local citizens when they are told that local citizens are the problem			0
the choice is not to use more firepower or withdraw			0
the real choice is whether the @entity3 is committed sufficiently to @entity4 and willing to invest in supporting long - term efforts that will give our soldiers and local citizens a reason to believe that things will get better			1
if the @entity3 is unwilling to make these commitments , then it should admit it and reduce the demands on its soldiers			2
either way , @entity3 must create a realistic basis for their activities in @entity4 and end the fiction of a smooth transfer of authority from our overburdened soldiers to @entity109 's corrupt administrators			1
realism will not please many @entity3 , but it will at least help to reduce the cycle of atrocities in @entity4			2
the time has come to escape the worst dynamics of @entity44 and re-learn the limits of @entity3 power			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			0

a killing spree in @entity4 follows @entity187 - burning incident
@entity183 says the @entity3 has had its worst month in the long @entity4 war
he says it 's *reminiscent* of @entity193 , when soldiers turned against population
@entity197 : @entity3 leaders are failing to set and pursue *achievable* *objectives*
