ambitious companies that ignore the imminent rise of @entity3 as the gateway to the @entity5 run the same risks as those that dismissed the disruptive innovations of @entity10 in 1998			1
the current generation of @entity12 are consumer products like @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16			1
smaller innovators like @entity18 are pursuing a less hardware or operating system dependent architecture			1
in the enterprise marketplace @entity23 capabilities feature in technologies like @entity27 's @entity26 and @entity28 from @entity29			1
in 2014 , there has been a surge in acquisitions of related artificial intelligence technologies by all the major technology companies			1
rapid advancements in the underlying technologies have also been taking place -- from neural networks to natural language processing to wearables and emotional recognition systems			1
the launch of the first mainstream high - impact @entity23 is perhaps four or five years away			1
what will a @entity23 do ? @entity12 will monitor mental and physical well - being , support lifestyle goals and ambitions through suggestions , prompts , and coaching			1
they will alert you when friends are nearby , translate both language and culture , help you budget or even intervene when you overextend			1
just like a guardian or parent , they will advise you to avoid walking down a particular road at night , or tell you to apply sunscreen based on your skin type and sun levels			1
many of these technologies currently exist in relative isolation and the power of the @entity23 will be in consolidating all these data points into an integrated user experience			1
this could be on your phone , your watch , in your car , and in your home			2
you 'll be able to choose if your @entity23 is like a butler , friend , colleague , slave , or even master			2
our research collaboration , @entity78 , with global media agency @entity79 focuses on understanding what people really want from the next generation of these services			2
our research findings we worked intensely for two months with 12 workshop participants experimenting with the latest technologies			2
we conducted expert interviews with leaders in the field on the technical , legal , and socio - economic possibilities and implications , and surveyed 1,000 smart phone users in the @entity95			2
one clear finding is that every organization in the world needs to prepare now for a va - infused future that will directly impact internal efficiencies and operations and external branding and growth strategies			2
preliminary results from our previous @entity105 at @entity106 indicated that wearables increased productivity in the workplace by 8.5 %			2
participants were keen to get real - time feedback on the potential correlations between data from their bodies and productivity and performance metrics			0
@entity12 will provide the automated opportunity to gather , analyze , and make recommendations from the data from not just one but all of your wearables in real - time			0
similar to a football coach , managers will have the ability to put their best employees " on the field " and make split second decisions on productivity			0
the @entity23 inside the company , and our heads internally , @entity12 will transform organizational behavior , leadership , and talent management			0
companies will develop branded @entity12 supporting organizational culture and productivity			0
think of them as super-powered intranets or enterprise portals providing voice - activated access to training , coaching , assessment , knowledge , and internal communications			0
early adopter companies can strategically position themselves as @entity23 proponents			0
already 62 % of @entity95 smart phone users say they are ready to integrate @entity12 into their everyday work lives			1
well - being programs are increasingly important in organizational culture , and @entity12 can help individual employees learn about boosting their productivity and reducing stress in order to reach their rofessional goals and aspirations			0
@entity12 will also operate as gateways to business intelligence within a company			0
optimizing their design and functionality for the needs of each individual organization will by a key ingredient to job satisfaction , retention , loyalty , and recruitment			0
va as disruptor another important component of the @entity23 will be to disrupt the consumer journey			0
for example , at the moment firms sell branded painkillers in your local pharmacy for up to 10 times the price of generic painkillers with identical ingredients			0
these identical products are often right next to each other on the shelf and yet consumers , typically out of brand loyalty and emotional triggers , will buy the branded product			0
@entity12 will augment the consumer journey by filling in our behavioral ' black holes ' and protecting us from simple emotional exploitations			0
your head and your heart might be telling you to buy the branded product partially because of the successful impact of the brand 's consumer behavior insight , but your @entity23 will automatically reinsert rationality into your decision - making process			0
organizations will need to adapt their strategies as technology succeeds in protecting customers from behavioral exploitation where regulatory bodies and self - regulating industries have failed			1
in 1998 @entity10 search spawned a revolution in the digital economy and fundamentally changed the way we connect with people , products and services			1
vas mark the next digital revolution and will have an even more profound impact on our organizations , everyday lives , commerce , interactions , and behaviors			1
