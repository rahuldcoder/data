same - sex couples can marry in @entity1 , but ca n't yet do the same in @entity3 , thanks to a pair of court rulings thursday			1
the @entity1 case is an entirely in - state matter , involving a local county court and the state 's @entity10			1
but it 's similar to a spate of federal rulings in recent months because the initial ruling that kicked off the process knocked down @entity1 law barring same - sex marriages			1
twenty - one gay and lesbian couples were part of a group of plaintiffs challenging @entity24 83 to the @entity25 , saying it violated their federal and state rights of equal protection and privacy			2
@entity32 circuit judge @entity31 ruled last friday in those couples ' favor			1
but after his decision , it was n't clear whether some same - sex couples could begin getting married immediately			2
the state @entity10 weighed in wednesday , ruling " the court 's order is not final , and we have no jurisdiction to hear the appeal			0
" the same court denied the state 's motion for an emergency stay of @entity31 's ruling			0
@entity31 issued what he called a " final order " on thursday , in lieu of the @entity51 ruling			0
on the same day , he issued another document saying " this court ... can not in good conscience grant " the state 's request for an immediate stay of his decision			0
" constitutional violations are routinely recognized as triggering irreparable harm unless they are promptly remedied , " @entity31 wrote , adding that " there is no evidence " those pushing to continue the state 's same - sex marriage ban " will be harmed , " but those trying to overturn the prohibition will suffer			1
the @entity70 / @entity69 posted links to @entity31 's orders on its website			0
the same office tweeted thursday afternoon , soon after the latest rulings : " the @entity70 and @entity77 is open for business and we are issuing marriage licenses to all qualified applicants			0
" @entity82 affiliate @entity81 reported the clerk was then issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples			2
it was not clear what was occurring in other @entity1 counties			0
a federal judge moved @entity3 in that same direction on tuesday , ruling that state 's laws violated the @entity92 because they " deny its gay and lesbian citizens the fundamental right to marry and relegate their families to a stigmatized , second - class status without sufficient reason for doing so			1
" while @entity102 magistrate judge @entity101 's decision striking down @entity3 's same - sex marriage ban was clear , it did n't take effect right away			1
she stated it would become law at 9 a.m. friday			0
that 's where the 9th @entity108 came in , with three judges signing onto a one - line ruling putting off @entity113 's decision from going into effect -- at least for now			0
the appeals judges ruled that @entity113 's ruling " is temporarily stayed pending this court 's disposition of appellants ' emergency motions for a stay pending appeal			2
" thursday 's decision from the 9th circuit appeals court prevents a repeat of what happened in @entity126 and @entity127 , where federal judges similarly struck down those states ' same - sex marriage bans effectively immediately			1
higher courts later stayed those decisions on appeal , but not before some same - sex couples married			2
same - sex couples marry in @entity127 before court halts licenses in recent months , federal judges have found restrictions limiting marriage to one man and one woman to be unconstitutional in several other states			1
but those rulings did n't take effect immediately , having been stayed as appeals courts and possibly the @entity102 @entity10 weigh in			0
appeals court scrutinizes @entity149 same - sex marriage ban			1

an @entity1 judge paves way for same - sex marriages
circuit judge says he is *remedying* harm
a federal appeals court stays a ruling that would allow such marriages in @entity3
