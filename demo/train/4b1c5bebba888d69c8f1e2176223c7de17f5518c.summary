-- despite access to free contraceptives , unplanned pregnancies are a rising problem for women in the @entity7 military , according to a new study			1
nearly 11 % of more than 7,000 active - duty women surveyed by the @entity10 in 2008 reported an unplanned pregnancy during the previous year			1
that 's 50 % higher than the average rate in the @entity7 , the study authors say			2
the study , publishing next month in the journal @entity17 , also notes that the rate has increased since 2005			2
authors dr. @entity19 and @entity21 analyzed data from the 2005 and 2008 @entity23 , which they obtained through a @entity26 request			2
" it 's alarming , " @entity19 said of the increasing rate			0
" when you 're in the military , that 's actually one time where you have access to free , good quality health care			1
... it really highlights the need to better address contraceptive care			0
" the military offers @entity40 - approved contraceptives , including emergency contraception , at no cost in its medical facilities , according to @entity44 , spokeswoman for the @entity45			1
" it 's important to note that contrary to the study , @entity47 has consistently found that the number of unintended pregnancies among female sailors and @entity54 is comparable to the national rates in the general population , " @entity44 wrote in an e-mail			1
military to open combat jobs to women the consequences unplanned pregnancies can have a significant impact on the health of military personnel and on troop readiness , according to the study			1
@entity67 who become pregnant unexpectedly while at home can not be deployed , which may affect their career			0
@entity67 who become pregnant while overseas must be sent home , which can cost the military around $ 10,000			2
research has shown approximately 43 % of unplanned pregnancies in the @entity7 end in abortion			1
" for women in the military , that can represent a huge challenge , " @entity19 said			2
federal law allows abortion to be covered at military facilities only when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest , or threatens the life of the woman			1
and going off - base for medical care in places like @entity93 or @entity94 can be extremely dangerous , @entity19 said			1
readers skirmish over women in battle behind the numbers sexual assault could be playing a role in the military 's high number of unplanned pregnancies , the study authors noted			1
research shows an estimated 20 % to 40 % of servicewomen experience rape or attempted rape during their military career			1
( exact numbers are difficult to obtain ; the @entity10 estimates more than 80 % of incidents are never reported			0
) a lack of sexual education and fears about repercussions could also be contributing factors , the authors said			0
in 2012 , @entity19 and @entity21 published results from a small online survey about the use of contraception in the military			2
close to 60 % of the 281 servicewomen surveyed said that contraception was easy or somewhat easy to obtain			0
the most common reason women cited for not using birth control while deployed was not planning to have sex			0
more than half of the respondents said they did not speak to a military medical provider about birth - control options before deploying			1
some felt policies prohibiting or discouraging sex during deployment prevented them and / or their doctors from initiating a conversation about contraception , the study authors said			0
not being able to access their preferred method of birth control was also cited as a reason for not using contraception			0
vaginal rings often can not be used due to refrigeration needs and refills of patches or pills may be delayed due to transportation issues			0
like many @entity7 , military personnel most frequently choose the pill and condoms for contraception , @entity44 said			0
" these methods are much more failure - prone than long - acting reversible contraceptives ( @entity157 ) such as intrauterine devices and hormonal implants , " she said			1
" increasing the acceptance and usage of @entity162 may decrease the unplanned pregnancy rate			0
" moving forward some branches of the military have already begun to address these issues			0
the @entity47 and @entity167 created the @entity168 and @entity169 ( @entity170 ) in 1999 to help reduce the occurrence of sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancies			1
" policies and programs , like @entity170 , have been put in place to help minimize these barriers , " @entity44 said			0
" as a result , we believe those mentioned by dr. @entity19 may exist in isolated cases but do not represent a systemic problem			0
" in 2012 , the @entity47 issued a policy requiring all females to be offered contraception services immediately after receiving orders to make sure they have time to find a contraception method before being deployed , @entity44 said			2
@entity47 medical facilities also have a film on the different kinds of contraceptives ; the facilities will soon receive another film on the consequences of unplanned pregnancies			1
the @entity47 also plans to add a " multi-hour , facilitated classroom lecture on family planning " to their mandatory training after boot camp , according to @entity202			2
@entity19 acknowledged these efforts , but said more needs to be done across all branches to provide education and access to contraception for servicewomen			0
" these findings highlight an important public health problem within the military that has not been adequately addressed , " the study authors wrote .			1
