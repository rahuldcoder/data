@entity0 -- unlike most issues these days that divide along party lines , the immediate fate of president @entity4 's new gun proposals will depend not as much on @entity8 as his fellow @entity9 in the @entity10			2
@entity10 @entity12 leadership sources tell @entity1 that passing any new legislation will be extremely difficult because more than a dozen vulnerable democrats from conservative states will probably resist much of what the president is pushing			1
these @entity12 sources say the most likely legislation to pass will be strengthening background checks , since it is the least overt form of gun control and it also appeals to gun rights advocates ' emphasis on keeping guns away from people with mental health and criminal problems			2
@entity4 announces 23 executive actions , asks @entity28 to pass gun laws although @entity9 like @entity31 will still make a high - profile push to renew the assault weapons ban and limit ammunition magazines to 10 rounds , senior @entity12 sources say it is hard to see those measures getting enough support to pass the @entity12 - led @entity10			2
the focus is on the @entity10 because @entity10 @entity12 leaders know that @entity41 @entity8 will not act on anything until the @entity10 does			1
@entity12 leadership sources say they intend to spend next week -- the first week the @entity10 is in session -- canvassing red - state democrats to see what , if anything , is doable			1
@entity12 senators who advocate various gun control measures will be lobbying their colleagues as well			0
see details of president 's proposals at a certain point , @entity12 leaders will decide the best course of action , if any			0
@entity12 leadership sources emphasize what senate majority leader @entity58 said in a @entity61 interview in recent days : they will not vote on any legislation unless they have 60 votes , enough to break a filibuster			0
@entity12 leadership sources say they have no intention of putting their members in a politically vulnerable position on a gun measure unless they are sure it can reach the president 's desk			0
in the short term , that would mean not only getting red - state @entity9 on board , but at least a handful of @entity10 republicans as well			1
there is some hope that @entity9 may be able to persuade @entity83 sen. @entity82 of @entity84 , a moderate , to help shape bipartisan legislation that can pass .			0

vulnerable democrats from conservative states might resist much of what president wants
@entity12 sources : tougher background checks most likely to pass , still face *uphill* @entity93
@entity10 @entity12 leaders say @entity41 @entity8 will not act on anything until @entity10 does
@entity9 aim to *recruit* red - state democrats and a handful of @entity8
