@entity0 -- the only original copy of the @entity3 in private hands worldwide has a fancy new display case at the @entity6 , where the document goes on display next month			1
" this 700 - year - old document looks better than ever , " said @entity9 , the archivist of the @entity10			1
he said thursday that the handwritten , fragile parchment will be unveiled february 17			0
the owner of the display copy was also at thursday 's preview			0
@entity16 , co-founder of the @entity18 investment company , said , " it is my privilege as an @entity10 to be able to give this back to the @entity6 and let them preserve it , as they have done , and to let them display it as they are going to do			1
" after an initial presentation to the public in 2008 , when @entity16 got the document at a @entity33 's auction for more than $ 20 million , it was taken off display for replacement of the old , unappealing box made out of aluminum and glass , with a green fabric liner			1
the new display box , crafted from aircraft - quality metal , is filled with argon gas to minimize deterioration of the parchment on which the handwritten @entity46 provisions of the @entity3 were first inscribed in 1297			1
the document seems to float above the floor of the display case , just below special glass that blocks damaging ultraviolet light and minimizes glare from subdued external lighting that will be used to illuminate the display			1
" if we could read medieval latin , it would be perfectly legible , " said @entity55 , one of the ranking conservators who led the yearlong restoration and re-encasement project at the @entity6			0
she said they were able to repair damaged sections of the parchment and have confirmed certain letters in the text by using special photography and lighting			0
" we have every reason to believe that 800 years from now , they will still be in fabulous shape , " she concluded			0
engineers from the @entity73 carried out the specifications of the @entity6 in building the display case			0
@entity16 took the opportunity to explain the significance fo the @entity3 and why he hopes the public display will help people understand @entity10 history			1
" this became the law of the land of @entity91 and remains the law of the land in @entity91 , " he began , noting that those who came to the colonies in @entity10 considered themselves @entity83 with the same rights as those at home			1
when royalty said the colonists did not enjoy equal rights , it set the stage for @entity10 independence			1
the founding fathers affirmed many elements of @entity91 law in establishing the @entity10			1
" our whole government is based on no taxation without representation , " @entity16 noted			1
" we have the right to habeus corpus ; we have punishment in proportion to the crime , trial by jury " and other fundamental principles originally requested nearly 800 years ago by the lords of the king of @entity91			0
" if you read the early writings of @entity119 and @entity120 and @entity121 and @entity122 , many times , they say ' it 's because of the @entity3 that we 're doing this , ' " he said			2
only 17 copies of the @entity3 are known to be in existence			2
fifteen of them are in @entity129 institutions , one is in the @entity132 parliament , according to @entity16 , " and this is the only one in private hands , " he said			2
" @entity136 bought this in the early 1980s , " @entity16 said , describing some of the previous ownership of his copy			2
he said @entity136 had purchased it from a family that held it for more than 500 years but had fallen on hard times and sold it to raise money			0
@entity16 is well - known within philanthropic circles			2
in recent weeks , he donated more than $ 7 million to help repair the @entity146 from last summer 's earthquake			0
he also owns a copy of the @entity149 , on display in the @entity151 of the @entity152 , " and i 've lent a copy of the @entity154 to the @entity155 , " he said			0
" everybody in life has certain things that they like , " he said , " and i guess one of the things i like is buying these documents and owning them			0
" @entity16 suggested that it is satisfying to have invested in history , " but you ca n't be buried with these documents , as far as i know			2
so you can assume that the appropriate place will see these documents when i 'm not on this @entity170			0
