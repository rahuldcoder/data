-- when you hear the term " working mom , " what image comes to mind ? is it of a woman , perhaps dressed in a suit , dropping off her kids at school or day care before hurrying to the office ? or is it a mom , possibly dressed in yoga pants , booting up her computer from the confines of her own home ? i bet many of you would pick the former -- the woman who works outside the house			1
i admit i tend to have that image in mind whenever i write about the juggling act facing working moms			1
but each time i do that , i am leaving out the women who work from home who face their own unique work - life balance challenges			1
( according to a recent @entity35 study , about 10 % of @entity33 workers now regularly work from home			1
) take the case of @entity37 , whose children are 13 and 15 and who has been working from home as a published author , freelance writer and blogger since her children were in elementary school			1
recently , she has been recruited for a few jobs , which would require her to work in an office			2
" my daughter told me , ' @entity52 , if you get that job , i 'm going to be so proud of you , like you 're going to have a real job , ' but i have a real job right now , " she told me while working during a vacation with her family			2
" but i realized how different it is , because of the way the media portrays women and work ... corporate women hitting it hard and that 's what my daughter sees			2
" " it 's a little bit more glamorous if you are leaving home because you get dressed			2
maybe i should get dressed every day , " she said with a laugh			0
simply your life : telecommuting is n't just for parents there are a host of misconceptions about working from home , said @entity76 , a mom of two and freelance writer and blogger			1
one of the biggest , she said , is the sense that you are available to take care of all the household matters while also doing your job			1
" you are really juggling everything at once with no lunch break , no coffee break and you do n't go home at night , " she said			1
" your office is right there and you have to learn to turn everything off , which is , i think , one of the biggest challenges			2
" too often , @entity76 , whose children are 4 and 6 , would get back on her laptop after she put the kids down to finish up all the things she did n't do that day , but that meant she was n't spending important time with her husband			0
" you do n't realize how much that time together , even if it 's sitting on the couch watching bad tv , matters , " she said , adding that she had to start scheduling evenings she does n't work to make sure she and her husband have one - on - one time			1
scheduling is a must to make working from home work , said @entity113 , who blocks out her day in the morning or the night before			1
" i have my little @entity115 calendar , which makes my life happy			2
" she also said she needs to leave the house , on occasion , and work from a local coffee shop -- but it 's not because she feels isolated			2
she works online and in social media , so she feels very social , she said			0
heading somewhere other than home helps her focus			0
" i go out and work in public coffee shops or with friends because i feel like that accountability , when there are other people around me who have gotten dressed , with their bag , gone into a place , i feel like i know they 're working , so i ca n't play on @entity133 , " she said			0
who works from home and how they do it @entity137 , publisher and founder of @entity139 , recently named by @entity140 as one of the top 75 career websites , said if you are thinking about working from home , you need to figure out if you have the personality to make it work			1
" while working from home cuts down on typical office distractions for many individuals , for others the lack of physical boundaries and a manager standing over their shoulder may not be enough structure for them to effectively work , " she said			1
the biggest benefit of working from home , hands down , is the flexibility			0
" i have 24 hours in my day and i can structure them as i need to , " said @entity113 , who said she can work in between picking up the kids from school , attending school functions and cooking her children a healthy meal for dinner			0
@entity76 bought a portable wireless device that allows her to be online anytime and anywhere			0
" i carry that around with me so if i 'm early to pick up the kids , and i have my laptop with me , i might get a little work done in the car , " she said			0
@entity137 , who launched a blog in 2009 devoted to helping women make telecommuting and home - based businesses work for them , said working from home gives women flexibility and freedom			1
work from home and still be part of the office " having a flexible schedule helps families to have more quality time together , " she said			1
" it provides greater overall satisfaction and it helps to lessen the guilt that many parents have because they 're unable to do everything			0
" it also , in @entity113 's case , allows you to do something else -- set up a yoga studio right in the office			0
so , whenever her neck starts to hurt from sitting too long in her chair , like mine is starting to do as i finish this column , she cues up a podcast and rolls out the mat right in her home office			0
" my mat is always there next to my desk , " she said			0
" i probably would n't do that if i were wearing pumps and in an office			0
" follow @entity211 on @entity212 and like @entity213 on @entity133 .			0

moms who work from home face unique work - life balance challenges
according to a study , about 10 % of @entity33 workers now regularly work from home
one misconception is that moms who work from home can do household chores and their job
writing up a *prioritized* " to do " list the night before is one way to make work from home work
