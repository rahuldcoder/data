-- rarely seen by outsiders , the daily life of a regional @entity3 commander named @entity4 and his militant fighters is dominated by extremes : love and war , attack and retreat , life and death			1
for nine days in october 2009 , @entity15 journalist @entity14 was behind the lines with the @entity3 , embedded as no @entity18 filmmaker before him			1
and he was there to witness firsthand the jarring juxtapositions in @entity4 's life , at turns -- directing an attack against @entity26 forces in @entity28 's treacherous mountains -- then hours later at home , a father playing with his children			1
to capture these intimate and unprecedented images , @entity14 risked his life to embed with @entity4 and his fighters in @entity35 -- the northeastern region where @entity36 is active and @entity37 was once rumored to be hiding			1
@entity38 : kidnapped by the @entity3 @entity14 said he does n't know the number of militants under @entity4 's command , but included in their ranks is another of @entity4 's sons -- a boy 12 or 13 years old			1
the son carries a machine gun nearly as large as he is , @entity14 said			1
" for @entity4 ... it 's not something bad to send your ... son out to fight , " he told @entity0 's @entity48 , because @entity4 believes that " ... his son will come to heaven when and if he dies in this war			2
" there are many different groups that make up the @entity3 , and they are fighting for many different reasons			1
@entity4 says he and his men joined the @entity3 to drive out foreign forces from his district			1
" we fight for our freedom , our religion , our honor and we fight for our land , " @entity4 tells @entity63			2
commanding his forces from a house built of stone and clay , he says he relies on contributions to fund his operation			2
firm casualty figures for both sides in the decade - long war are hard to come by			2
it 's not known how many @entity3 forces have been killed fighting @entity26 - led coalition forces			1
according to the @entity82 , more than 2,200 coalition troops have died in @entity28 since @entity26 forces invaded in response to the 9/11 attacks			2
more than 1,400 @entity26 are among those coalition deaths			2
as he urges his fighters to battle , @entity4 questions coalition motives			2
" for what purpose are they fighting us ? " asks @entity4			0
" are they oppressed ? have they been treated unfair ? are they living in a dictatorship ? " oppression is an accusation critics have aimed at the @entity3 for decades			1
they rule their lives by an extremely strict interpretation of @entity102			0
in places under their control , women shroud their faces and bodies in burqas and girls are forbidden to attend school			0
" there is nothing that @entity102 does not have the solution for , " @entity111 , a local @entity3 judge , explains to @entity63			1
" if a person cuts off another person 's hand , then according to @entity102 law , you have the right to retaliate and cut his hand off			0
it 's the same with the ears , the teeth the eyes and the nose			0
" the @entity3 government ruled @entity28 -- and gave safe harbor to @entity36 terrorist training camps -- from the mid- 1990s until 2001			1
leaders refused to extradite @entity37 , prompting the @entity26 invasion which toppled the @entity3 government and made way for national elections			1
a decade later , @entity4 's fighters march through @entity35 's difficult terrain with heavy firearms and bandoliers of ammunition slung across their shoulders			0
some wear traditional @entity28 clothing and others dress in camouflage military fatigues as they trudge across canyons dotted with rocks , small trees and scrubby vegetation			0
as @entity63 films , @entity4 directs an attack on @entity26 troops , coordinating the operation by hand - held radio from a mountain perch overlooking a valley road hundreds of feet below			0
eighty holy warriors are participating in this assault , @entity4 says			0
they 've taken positions in eight different places in groups of ten men each			0
" attack , attack , with the help of @entity164 ! " @entity4 shouts into his radio			0
" you hit the vehicle , you hit it ! " but did the fighters damage a vehicle or kill coalition forces as they thought ? the answer seems to be no. apparently , the attack was n't even worthy of a report			0
a @entity26 press officer searched through 1,800 reports from october 2009 and said , " to be clear : we have no reports of any @entity3 attacks in that area during the timeframe given			1
" as the attack ends , the sound of gunfire echoes across the valley , a plume of smoke rising in the distance			0
" @entity3 are like most @entity102 insurgents , " said @entity14			1
" when they have spare time , they read the @entity191			0
from what i could see from the firing they were not very accurate			0
" he acknowledges that he expects criticism for being embedded with fighters trying to ambush coalition forces			2
" i understand that this is very emotional for people -- especially people in the armed forces , " @entity14 told @entity48			1
" i 'm a journalist , i just film what happened			2
" the war has become " routine " for this band of @entity3 fighters , said @entity14			1
" they do an ambush and then spend the rest of the day sitting around gossiping on the radio			0
they sit , they drink a lot of tea and they have some games they are playing			0
" one of the games is a simple rock throwing contest			0
standing in a relatively flat clearing , the men square off to see who can throw heavy rocks the farthest			0
most use a two - handed thrust - from - the - chest technique			0
in the end , the commander wins			0
" this is everyday life , " @entity14 told @entity48			1
" this is the @entity3			1
" one day , @entity63 notices @entity4 is nervous about a suspicious plane flying over the @entity3 fighter 's hideout			1
the commander orders @entity63 to remain inside			0
later , @entity63 hears gunfire			0
@entity4 knocks at the door telling @entity14 to get out immediately			1
" leave your things , " the commander says			0
" " we found an old abandoned shed and we slept there during the night " as the gunfire continued , said @entity14			1
by daybreak @entity14 is told that a dozen people -- including @entity244 's top lieutenant -- had been killed in a @entity246 raid			1
@entity14 finds @entity4 " crying like a kid " over his lost men			2
later , @entity4 flees with his family , fearing for his life			2
@entity14 knows that the images he captured will be surprising to many -- and disturbing to some			1
but he feels confident that the images are authentic , not an attempt at propaganda			2
if the @entity3 wanted to create propaganda , they would demonstrate a show of strength -- not their softer side , he said			2
" showing them [ selves ] as humans , they do n't understand any purpose of that			0

@entity15 journalist @entity14 embedded with the @entity3 last year to capture daily life
rarely seen by outsiders , he saw plans for attacks as well as a home life of the @entity3
@entity14 says he knows that the images he captured will be surprising to many , and disturbing to some
