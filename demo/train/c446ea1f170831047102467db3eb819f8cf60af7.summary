@entity0 , @entity1 -- you might recognize prominent primatologist @entity4 from lectures he has given about his research on primate behavior , which have been popularized on @entity8			1
his face is familiar to chimpanzees , too ; some chimps that he knew as babies still recognize him even after decades apart , he said			1
" chimpanzees have the advantage that you can not ask them questions , so you have to watch ( their ) behavior to see what they do , " says @entity13 , director of @entity16 's @entity15 , in his @entity18 - accented voice that is both gentle and authoritative			0
he adds , with dry humor : " with humans , you can ask questions and you get all sorts of answers i do n't trust , so i prefer to work with chimpanzees for that reason			1
" living links is part of the oldest and largest primate center in the @entity35 : the @entity15 , a secluded grassy area in suburban @entity37 where humans work in office trailers and other animals play in open - air compounds			1
@entity41 , who has been at the center for more than 20 years , has made a career out of finding links between primate and human behavior , particularly in the areas of morality and empathy			1
you might think of " morality " as special for humans , but there are elements of it that are found in the animal kingdom , says de @entity4 -- namely , fairness and reciprocity			1
his latest study , published this week in the journal @entity59 , suggests that chimpanzees may show some of the same sensibility about fairness that humans do			1
the popular belief that the natural world is based on competition is a simplification , @entity13 says			0
the strength of one 's immune system , and the ability to find food , are also crucial			0
and many animals survive by cooperating			0
" the struggle for life is not necessarily literally a struggle , " he said			0
" humans are a highly cooperative species , and we can see in our close relatives where that comes from			1
" mammals such as wolves , orcas and elephants need their groups to survive , and empathy and cooperation are survival mechanisms			0
@entity41 discusses these mechanisms in his 2009 book " @entity95 : nature 's lessons for a @entity98			0
" " we think that empathy evolved to take care of others that you need to take care of , especially , of course , between mother and offspring , which is universal in all the mammals , " de @entity4 said			1
laboratory chimps get a new lease on life what it means to be fair @entity41 is n't sure that his monkeys have what a philosopher would call a " concept of justice " in an intellectual sense			1
but the emotional reactions researchers have observed indicates that there is , at a more basic level , a sense of justice among them			1
among the questions he investigates : if an animal gets more than another , is there is a feeling that this is somehow unjust ? and if one shares food with another , is there an expectation of returning the favor ? in a 2008 study , @entity13 and colleagues put two capuchin monkeys @entity142 and gave them a simple task to complete : giving a rock to the experimenter			1
they were given cucumbers as a reward for executing the task , and the monkeys obliged			0
but if one of the monkeys was given grapes , something interesting happened : as observed in a popular video that @entity13 showed in his @entity159 talk , after receiving the first piece of cucumber , the capuchin monkey gives the experimenter a rock as expected			0
but upon seeing that the other monkey has grapes , the capuchin monkey throws the next piece of cucumber that it is given back at the researcher			0
like children , the monkeys feel they " need to get the same thing as somebody else , " de @entity4 said			1
based on experiments such as these , @entity13 came to believe that the sense of fairness observed in monkeys is egocentric			1
the capuchin monkeys were upset , selfishly , when they did n't get the grapes that their neighbors received			0
@entity41 believed this model of fairness would apply to chimpanzees also			1
chimpanzees are so closely related to us that they share 99 % of their dna with humans			1
but the new study , which compares chimpanzees to young children , makes @entity13 rethink that view			1
" now with this experiment , we are thinking that they have a higher level , where they worry about reward division in general , " he said , " and it 's now unclear how they differ from humans			2
" the new study : a human sense of fairness ? in the new study , @entity13 and colleagues had chimpanzees and , separately , young children , play an " ultimatum game			1
" this is " the gold standard of fairness for humans " because it has been played all over the world , by people in different cultures , to show that , universally , humans appear to have a sense of fairness			1
here 's a video of the experiment the basic structure of an ultimatum game is that there are rewards that can be divided between two individuals			0
one proposes how to divide them and the other accepts or rejects this offer			0
if the receiver rejects , no rewards are given out			0
human trials have shown that people usually propose a generous division of the goodies , such as half and half or 60 % and 40 % , @entity13 said			2
in the version used in the new experiment , six adult chimpanzees and 20 human children , between ages 2 and 7 , participated			2
the setup was such that a token could be traded for equal rewards for both partners , and a token that would give more goodies to the partner who made the choice			0
in some trials , one partner proposes a reward division to the other via a token , and the receiver must accept the token in order for both parties to get rewards			0
in others , the partner 's acceptance is not required			0
the researchers found that chimpanzees and children both tended to make decisions about splitting rewards similarly to adult humans			2
in the situation where the responder could accept or reject the division of rewards , both chimpanzees and children tended to split the rewards with their partners			0
but when the partner was not given the opportunity to reject the proposal , chimps and kids tended to choose the selfish arrangement -- a token that favored the chooser			2
controversial results so , does this mean that chimpanzees show the same sense of fairness as humans ? @entity288 of the @entity289 , who has conducted similar experiments in the past , is n't so sure			1
his results did not show that chimpanzees have a sense of fairness			1
@entity288 is concerned about the results of this new study because it 's not clear that the responders knew that they could reject offers			2
none of the participants , human or chimp , ever rejected the offers of their partners			2
" the fact that responders never rejected nonzero offers suggests that they were not sensitive to unfairness but were only motivated by getting food for themselves , regardless of the intentions of the proposers or the consequences for them , " he said in an e-mail			2
but @entity13 said that responders did display negative reactions in response to some offers			2
chimps would spit water and the children would say something like " you 're getting more than me " in response to a selfish offer			1
" that indicates that they know what 's going on , " he said			0
@entity288 also criticized the design of the experiment because participants were primarily interacting with the researchers , not each other			0
although one chimp had to pass a token to the other , this could be just a necessary step to get food , not a sign of agreement with the offer , he said			0
but @entity13 stands by the study			2
there are very few studies of this nature on chimpanzees compared to in humans , and more research should be done to explore the nature of the sense of fairness of human relatives			1
meet one of the oldest chimpanzees in captivity the secret lives of primates there 's still a lot that humans do n't know about their close relatives			1
@entity41 has made some fascinating inroads , however , including a study showing that chimpanzees can look at the behind of another chimpanzee and match it to the corresponding face , provided it 's a chimp they know			2
this shows that the chimps have " whole - body knowledge , " a concept that has not been rigorously tested in humans , he said			1
the research won him a 2012 @entity380 , honoring research that is both humorous and thought - provoking , shared with @entity382			2
and he has also studied yawn contagion , the phenomenon of one person yawning in response to another person 's yawn			1
those who are sensitive to yawns tend to be more empathetic people , and friends and family members yawn more with each other than with strangers			2
this has also been shown in chimpanzees , who will yawn if another chimp they know yawns too			0
but @entity13 is n't sure , for instance , why three females were patrolling their compound when @entity2 visited in october			0
males , though , have a clear purpose in patrolling : in the wild , they do it to protect their territory , @entity13 said			0
perhaps , he postulates , the females are mimicking the males			0
chimp males compete with each other regularly , but also come together to repair their relationships , @entity13 said			0
this pattern of behavior is seen in human families and in the workplace -- these cycles of one - upmanship and reconciliation			0
" there are many animals who are very good at cooperation , and i 'm personally not convinced that we humans are necessarily best at that , but we are very good at it , that 's for sure			0
" his next book , coming out this spring , is called " @entity433 and the @entity434 : in @entity443 , " which brings together evidence that there are biological roots in human fairness and addresses the role of religion in society .			1

his new study suggests that chimps have a human sense of fairness
chimps yawn in response to other chimps yawning , just like humans , his research suggests
