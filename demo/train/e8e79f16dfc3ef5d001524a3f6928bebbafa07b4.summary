-- sadly , the down economy has put a lot of workers over age 50 in the unenviable position of needing to find a new profession			1
do n't believe that old clich√© about middle - aged dogs and new tricks , though ; lots of wildly successful people found big success in careers they began after their fiftieth birthdays			1

" @entity16 " had a relatively successful restaurant and motel on @entity24 25 in @entity25 , @entity26 , but when @entity28 opened seven miles from @entity16 ' restaurant , his business begin to dwindle			1
rather than go broke , he began to work on perfecting his spice blend and quick - cooking technique for making fried chicken in 1952			2
he then began touring the country selling @entity35 franchises , and by the time he sold the business for $ 2 million in 1964 , there were over 900 of them			2
@entity39 you may not recognize @entity42 's name , but you 've surely heard of his invention , the @entity43			2
@entity42 spent most of his career as a nuclear physicist who worked in aerospace and defense , including playing a significant role in supplying parts for @entity54 's @entity53 project			2
in 1970 the 50 - year - old @entity42 started @entity55 in an effort to find a weapon that could incapacitate assailants without killing them			1
he received a patent for his design in 1974 , and by 1980 @entity42 had sold the @entity62 on using his new gadget to help apprehend violent suspects			2
when @entity42 passed away last year at the age of 88 , his device was in use in over 45 countries around the world			1
@entity70 whether or not you know it , you probably owe @entity70 a tip of the cap each time you reach for a deck of cards			2
the @entity78 is considered to be the world 's first technical writer on the rules of card games , and he did n't put pen to paper as a young card sharp			0
@entity70 was around 70 years old when he first began recording the rules of various card games in 1741 ; over the last 27 years of his life , his smash hit " a @entity89 on the @entity90 " went through over a dozen editions			0

@entity93 @entity93 's " @entity99 " may be some of the world 's most beloved children 's books , but she was no spring chicken when she sat down to write them			1
@entity93 did n't publish her first novel until she was 65 years old , but she still managed to crank out one of the most beloved series of all time			1
@entity104 you do n't have to start early to become the richest man in the world			0
@entity104 was an economics professor until he left academia at age 55 to become a real estate investor in 1959			1
@entity104 had recently inherited a couple of buildings from his father , and he jumped headfirst into @entity115 's real estate scene			0
@entity104 started his second career by investing in the @entity117 where he spent his childhood , and within a matter of years he was presiding over @entity121 's real estate boom			1
when @entity104 died in 1993 , he was @entity123 ' two - time reigning world 's richest man with a net worth of around $ 13 billion			0
he was something of a @entity121 precursor to @entity127 , though			0
@entity104 never seemed totally comfortable with the fame and fortune his second career won him			0
he dressed traditionally , abstained from alcohol , and lived a fairly modest life			0
@entity132 @entity132 is one of the biggest names in @entity24 folk art , and she did n't even pick up a brush until she was well into her eighth decade			0
@entity132 was originally a big fan of embroidery , but once her arthritis grew too painful for her to hold a needle , she decided to give painting a try in the mid- 1930s			0
she was 76 when she cranked out her first canvas , and she lived another 25 years as a painter -- long enough to see the canvases she had sold for $ 3 fetch prices north of $ 10,000			0
@entity146 the founder of the @entity149 movement was 69 years old before he started the @entity149			1
in his native @entity150 , @entity146 had been a chemist and a @entity152 scholar in @entity153 , but in 1965 he came to @entity154 with just fifty bucks , a pair of cymbals , and a desire to spread the teachings of @entity159			0
@entity146 got off to a modest start by sitting on a sidewalk in the @entity162 and chanting , but by the time of his death in 1977 his legions of followers were rumored to be thousands strong			0
@entity167 and @entity168 the husband - and - wife team behind the popular dining surveys of the same name were corporate lawyers when they first started printing their restaurant guides			2

@entity168 eventually left the corporate law world to work on the dining surveys as well			0
