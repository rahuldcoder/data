@entity0 -- a gang that smuggled @entity5 citizens into the @entity6 and @entity7 , sometimes forcing them to work as prostitutes , has been busted with 75 arrests in @entity10 and @entity11 , authorities announced saturday			1
the trafficking ring was based in -- and directed from -- @entity5 , but its two suspected leaders in @entity7 were arrested in the operation , in @entity16 , @entity10 national police said in a statement			1
besides the two main suspects , @entity10 police arrested 49 others carrying forged passports at the airports in @entity16 , @entity0 , @entity23 and five other cities			1
in @entity11 , there were 24 arrests			1
the smugglers charged 40,000 to 50,000 euros ( $ 53,000 to $ 66,000 ) to transport @entity5 citizens , assigned with false identities , to the @entity6 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , the statement said			1
@entity10 was the next - to - last stop for many before they went to the preferred locations of the @entity6 and @entity33 , the statement said			1
twins rescued as @entity5 hospital trafficking probe continues the arrests were made last june and the case , at @entity10 's @entity45 , has been under seal until now , a national police spokesman told @entity1 on saturday			1
all of the suspects are @entity5 , or from elsewhere in @entity48			2
all have had initial court appearances and have been ordered to remain in prison while the investigation continues or have been released by the judge , with conditions , said the spokesman , who by custom is not identified			0
the suspects include those who allegedly formed part of the smuggling ring and also those who paid for the forged documents , the spokesman said			2
police seized 81 forged passports , ostensibly from @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 -- but all made in @entity5 , they said			2
investigators also found three laptop computers , printers and 22 rubber stamps used to forge documents at homes they said the gang used in @entity16 , police said			0
the probe began two years ago			0
investigators said the trafficking ring was intricately structured , divided into independent and virtually isolated cells to avoid detection , police said			0
the smugglers used their own set of trustworthy travel enforcers , well - versed in the airports and cities where the @entity5 were taken			2
they kept the travelers under control , sometimes trying to pass them off unnoticed among groups of legitimate @entity5 tourists			0
the ring was quick to react to security changes on the ground at a given airport , swiftly changing to another destination where it would be easier to have their people slip past security controls , the statement said			0
once a delivery of smuggled @entity5 citizens had been completed , the travel enforcers would return to their bases in @entity5 and @entity65 to await further instructions , and to avoid detection by @entity109 police forces , police said			0
@entity10 police have been active in recent years in fighting human trafficking rings that lured citizens from @entity48 , @entity113 or @entity7 to @entity10			1
the victims are often promised a better life , but then subjected to harsh forced labor conditions in clandestine factories or forced them into prostitution .			0
