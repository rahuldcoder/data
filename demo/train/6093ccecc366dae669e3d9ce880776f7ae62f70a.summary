-- @entity1 , meet @entity2			1
apparently you are n't very familiar with his work			2
he 's a professional boxer , pretty good one , too			1
he 's won three world championships			1
but he 's not particularly loud and boastful			2
nor does he carry a big punch			0
nor is he an imposing physical presence , standing just 5 - foot - 6			0
saturday night , at the @entity12 , in front of a pay - per - view audience , he gets to show @entity1 what they have been missing			2
a career that started when a rambunctious 10 - year - old found his way to the gym in @entity18 , @entity19 , culminates in a 12 - round test against one of the two best fighters in the world			1
@entity2 , with 28 wins and no losses ( one no contest ) , gets his chance of a lifetime against @entity29 , whom we 're pretty sure you have heard of			1
casual fans , on the whole , think @entity2 has no chance			1
boxing analysts will say he can win -- if -- but you get a sense they do n't think he has much of a chance either			2
@entity40 's @entity39 predicts a knockout			2
@entity29 on boxing and politics " there 's a lot of pressure riding on this , " @entity2 said by phone while on his team bus a week ago			1
" by winning this fight , this changes our lives forever			0
we 'll be able to put some money in our pockets , and by winning a huge fight like this we can secure our futures			0
" @entity2 will get at least $ 5 million ( plus money from the pay - per - view sales ) , by far the biggest payday of his career			1
he promises he will put the money away , so when he retires , he , his wife and three children will have plenty and he wo n't ever have to come back to the fight game			2
if you ask anyone outside the @entity2 camp why he could win , they do n't necessarily point to one thing he does particularly well in the ring			1
" @entity2 , in almost every respect is a b - plus fighter but he has @entity83 determination that makes him special , " said @entity75 , a @entity0 contributor and an analyst for @entity78 , which like @entity0 is owned by @entity79			1
@entity2 said he can not be outworked			1
he means in the ring -- and out			0
on @entity75 's show " @entity89 , " @entity2 's trainer and @entity29 's sparred over who works harder in the gym			1
" i do n't think there 's anybody that trains harder than this guy , " @entity90 said			1
" @entity29 will train harder than him and that 's why we 'll win , " @entity95 retorted			1
" i do n't think so , " @entity90 answered , a bemused smile crossing his face			2
" they do n't know , they do n't know , " @entity2 added			1
" they do n't know where i come from			2
they do n't know my background			2
" @entity2 said his determination comes from life in the tough neighborhood of the @entity108 in @entity18			1
let 's just say there are n't any manicured lawns in that section of town			1
there was plenty of trouble to be found			0
@entity2 got suspended in second grade for fighting			1
he got suspended in fourth grade for fighting			0
he once punched another kid a couple of times for nudging him -- with his wheelchair			0
when he was 10 , the story goes , a friend told him to take his butt to the @entity127			2
@entity2 told his dad he wanted to give boxing a shot			1
@entity131 , as @entity2 is known , said sure , as long as you listen to your coach -- me -- which sometimes required a good dose of understanding			1
once during a workout at the family home , @entity131 , a security officer , wanted to use a medicine ball , but there was none around			0
" he goes out into the desert and gets a rock , " the younger @entity2 told @entity78 , which followed both @entity2 and @entity29 ( 54 - 3 - 2 , 38 @entity143 ) as they prepared for the fight			1
" he gets a rock ! ... he 's trying to hit me with a rock on my stomach			2
" @entity2 said his dad pushed him until he would cry , then would tell him " you think this is hard , wait until you get in that ring			1
" @entity75 said he talked to the elder @entity2 about the difficult training , and @entity131 said his influences were hard - assed football coaches and that was the way he trained his son			1
@entity131 was also able to use boxing as an enticement to his son , a poor student			0
the grades and discipline improved when @entity2 's parents threatened to hold him out of the ring			1
@entity131 has been in his son 's corner for every fight , through more than 140 amateur battles and his rise through the 140 - pound division			2
as he 's fought bigger fights for bigger purses , @entity2 has added a few people to his staff , but not many			1
he likes to keep his team small , preferring family and a few close friends			0
it 's a matter of trust , he said			2
he just does n't let many outside people into his circle			0
it 's not like he 's an introvert			0
on the contrary , he 's a sociable , friendly guy whom everyone likes			0
he 's definitely not a thug like he was when he was a child			0
it 's a form of protection			0
" it 's a way to keep the leeches out , " he said			0
" i 'm making some money now , and lot of people change			0
" lots of strangers come up to him , shove a card in his hand and offer something			0
@entity2 wonders , " where were you 10 years ago , eight years ago when i was struggling ? " where were they before he left to fight @entity204 in 2008 , when he boarded the plane to @entity206 with just $ 11 in the bank , knowing he could n't lose			1
if he did , he would n't be able to afford to be a full - time fighter			0
when you watch videos of the two boxers doing their running , the stark difference in the entourages hits you like a @entity29 straight left			1
what seem like a dozens people or more follow the @entity217 legend , while @entity2 jogs alone or with a brother - in - law			2
but unlike training runs of the past , @entity2 spends a lot more time waving to folks in the neighborhood			2
his celebrity has taken off since he signed to fight @entity29			1
everywhere he goes he stops for pictures , signs autographs , takes a little time to talk to his supporters			0
the big - money fight has also afforded him the opportunity to add some specialists to his staff			0
@entity2 , who commits to a vegan diet during training camp , has hired a chef from his favorite restaurant to come to @entity236 so he wo n't have to eat in the hotel restaurants and fret that he might eat the wrong thing			1
he has a new massage therapist , who is the wife of his strength coach			0
got ta keep it in the " family , " he reminded			0
" you do n't want just anybody laying hands on you , " he said			0
there is no doubt that @entity29 will lay his hands on @entity2 plenty on saturday			1
@entity75 said @entity29 's best chance for a knockout will come early			1
if it goes past five rounds , well , " that 'll be a dogfight			0
" finding the next @entity29 @entity2 has n't seemed overwhelmed by increased media attention , the increased fan adoration , the increased pressure from getting in with the mighty @entity29			1
" once i set foot in that ring it does n't matter who you are , it does n't matter what you 've done , " he said			0
he echoed earlier comments that his preparation for this fight , essentially the past 18 years , will ensure a legendary victory			0
" i do n't care if he climbed @entity271			0
i do n't care if he 's walking on water			2
this is about me , " he told reporters last week			0
" every morning i wake up and look at myself in the mirror			0
if i am at my very best , i will win the fight			0
i put in the time , the dedication and the hard work			0
