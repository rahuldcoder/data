-- @entity1 and @entity2 cited slavery 's " regrettable " role in the @entity7 school 's history and announced that it will remove @entity9 battle flags from a chapel that serves as a major meeting place			1
the decision was announced in a message tuesday from university president @entity14 following discussions of concerns raised by black students about the campus environment			1
in 1826 the @entity2 -- then @entity19 -- owned between 70 to 80 slaves and benefited from their labor , wrote @entity14			0
" acknowledging that historical record -- and acknowledging the contributions of those individuals -- will require coming to terms with a part of our past that we wish had been different but that we can not ignore , " @entity14 said			0
@entity14 also said that the regimental flags are going to be removed from @entity30			1
the flags are replicas of original and historic battle flags that were once at the site			1
the university in @entity36 is named for president @entity37 and @entity38 , the @entity9 general who later served as school president until his death in 1870			1
he is buried in a crypt beneath the landmark chapel			1
the original flags will be placed on rotating display at @entity46 in a more " appropriate location " where the stories behind them can be properly told , wrote @entity14			2
a group of black law students , referred to as " @entity53 , " has been communicating with the administration about its concerns , leader @entity50 said wednesday			2
their letter began a dialogue between the students and the administration			2
" it 's about creating a climate on campus that everyone feels welcome , " @entity50 told @entity0 on why he sought the changes			0
he said some students felt uncomfortable with the flags at @entity30			1
" these are huge steps			1
we are ecstatic , " @entity50 said of @entity14 's announcement			2
black students comprise 2 % of the undergraduate student body at @entity72			1
" it 's commendable that the university and the administration took into consideration the feelings of all students , " @entity73 , former president of the @entity74 , told @entity0			2
" i think these are age - old issues that are as challenging as they are controversial and i think there are people all across the spectrum that understand no solution will please everyone			0
but i do think what was incredibly encouraging was the care the administration used with these issues , " @entity73 said			0
" schools are more than just their history , " @entity73 said			0
in april , @entity14 said questions raised by law students were legitimate			1
" @entity72 seeks to establish a climate of learning in which we treat all individuals with respect and trust			1
if even one person thinks that we have not met our aspiration in that regard , we must listen to them and examine why			0
we are doing so , and we will continue to do so , " he wrote			0
in his letter tuesday , the administrator said the purpose of the historic flags in a campus setting is to educate			2
" they are not to be displayed for decoration , which would diminish their significance , or for glorification , or to make a statement about past conflicts , " he wrote			0
" the reproductions are not genuinely historic ; nor are they displayed with any information or background about what they are			0
the absence of such explanation allows those who either ' oppose ' or ' support ' them to assert their own subjective and frequently incorrect interpretations			0
" @entity73 says he does not hold a grudge against @entity1 and @entity38 , because no institution is void of racism			0
" i think going to school here knowing @entity38 and his history is like asking why you would n't boycott the @entity138 dollar bill when @entity37 was a slave owner			0
" opinion : why we need to talk about reparations ' why i 'm tired of hearing about ' that ' civil rights movement ' opinion : history lost : @entity147 burning again opinion : @entity9 flag was the the flag of traitors @entity0 's @entity151 and @entity152 contributed to this report .			1
