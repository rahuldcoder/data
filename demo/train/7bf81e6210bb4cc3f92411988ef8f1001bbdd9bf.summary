-- that 's right , i said it			0
@entity5 says the @entity6 is missing its chance to win black voters			1
the @entity6 as a whole is completely scared of black voters , and the actions by the front - runners for the party 's 2008 nomination show they are continuing the same silly political games the party has played for years			1
oh , do n't bother tossing out the appointments of @entity18 and @entity19 as secretary of state by @entity21			0
yes , they are african - american			0
but i 'm speaking of the party			0
ever since @entity25 ran for the @entity26 , the @entity6 has run on a " @entity27 , " meant to alienate blacks in an effort to garner white voters			1
they 've worked the strategy to perfection			0
when he was head of the @entity35 , @entity34 apologized for that strategy as he sought to make inroads among black voters			1
republicans will tell you they are the party of @entity42 , who signed the @entity43 , but their outreach efforts to black voters are lacking			1
oh , yes , i know			0
@entity45 have a stranglehold on the black vote , receiving upward of 90 percent in national elections			1
a significant part of that is a result of the party seeing blacks as the backbone of the party			2
but the reality is that when you have only one party that truly makes a play for those voters , of course you will see such disparities ! that 's why it 's dumb , dumb , and dumber for the leading @entity6 candidates to skip thursday 's debate hosted by @entity67 and airing on @entity68			1
@entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and sen. @entity72 have all cited " scheduling conflicts " as the reason for their lack of attendance to debate at @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity83 , even though @entity74 personnel tell me they began discussions with then - @entity35 head @entity34 in february 2006			1
when the debate was announced earlier this year , along with a @entity45 forum held in june at @entity85 , the @entity35 promised their candidates would speak			1
but those of us who follow politics knew that was n't going to happen			0
this summer , all of the @entity35 candidates , save @entity94 rep. @entity93 , skipped the @entity95 and the @entity97 conventions			1
ok , i get the former , but the @entity97 ? president @entity21 has spoken there several times as president ! the @entity6 keeps blowing a big opportunity by ignoring blacks			1
and what about the debate sponsored by @entity107 language tv station @entity106 ? only @entity72 accepted the invite			0
today 's generation of blacks and latinos should n't be seen as the same as their parents			2
an increasing number of people are refusing to identify themselves with a party , and looking at issues			0
@entity111 have been a huge part of the @entity35 outreach , but the immigration debate is turning that in a different direction			1
why should the @entity6 talk to black voters , and what would they talk about ? first , i can tell you that immigration is huge in the black community , and gets folks riled up in a hurry ( you ought to see my talk show lines when this comes up )			1
education and health care are also major			1
and every @entity6 debate has been about faith in the public square , and we know that plays well with black voters			1
now , when it comes to the war in @entity142 , the @entity6 can forget that tune			2
and they are completely uneven on the issue of civil rights			0
here is an example that further explains the @entity6 's stupidity on this topic			2
several years ago , a @entity35 in the @entity154 - @entity153 area was trying to unseat then - rep. @entity155 , a heavily entrenched @entity156			2
that summer , a series of black churches were being burned			2
my good friend , @entity159 , a third - generation black @entity159 , was planning to hold a fundraiser at his home for the @entity6 candidate			1
he called the campaign and said it would be a good idea for the candidate to make a statement on the burnings , condemning them and saying it did n't make sense			0
the campaign said no. @entity159 called back and made the suggestion again , and the response was they did n't want to seem as if they were pandering to the black community			0
he laughed at that because the campaign was bringing then - rep. @entity179 , a prominent black @entity35 , to visit black churches with the candidate			1
hello ! that 's pandering			0
so @entity159 told his wife , @entity183 , what the candidate said			0
she replied , " any man who is such a coward that he ca n't speak against churches being burned is not welcome in my home			0
" the fundraiser was called off			0
here was a simple opportunity to actually show that he cared , but the candidate was so scared to say something , he turned off a campaign donor			0
will speaking at one debate turn around decades of black support for the @entity45 ? nope			1
but not speaking will just mean business as usual , and the @entity6 needs less of that			2
@entity5 is a nationally award - winning , multifaceted journalist and @entity0 contributor			2
@entity5 is studying to receive his master 's degree in @entity203 at @entity204 , and is the author of " listening to the @entity206			2
" you can read more of his columns at @entity209 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer			0

@entity5 : @entity35 outreach efforts to black voters are lacking
@entity5 : @entity45 win the black vote because they try for it
@entity5 : @entity6 could appeal to blacks on immigration , education , health care
