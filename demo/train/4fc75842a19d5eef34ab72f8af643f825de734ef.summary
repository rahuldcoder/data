-- a major @entity2 trade union called on workers to strike tuesday , as the country 's @entity4 prepares to vote on austerity measures to try to bring the country 's budget under control			1
the strikes were causing transport chaos in cities across the country , with parts of the metro shut down in @entity17 , the @entity2 news agency @entity10 reported			1
the @entity19 union said demonstrations were planned for cities including @entity17 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and many others			1
the strike comes amid international worries about the health of @entity2 's economy , the third - largest in @entity30			0
@entity2 premier @entity31 last month insisted that his country could confront the financial anxieties shadowing @entity2 and rest of the continent			1
speaking to lawmakers , he said the economic challenges @entity2 faces need " to be tackled with determination and without panic			0
" but he also noted " we do not deny we are facing a crisis , " adding : " we need to work together to overcome it			0
" there have been fears that the debt crisis roiling @entity47 and @entity48 is spreading to @entity2 and could affect the stability of the euro , the currency used by 17 nations on the continent			1
@entity2 has one of the lowest growth rates in the world and among the highest public debts , warned @entity58 , a senior fellow at the @entity59 and former @entity61 executive board member			2
he said the roots of @entity2 's troubles lie in its huge public debt and low growth rate			1
@entity2 's economy has been growing at only 0.3 % , he said , and most importantly is projected to grow at a similarly feeble rate for the next few years			2
" this very low rate of growth really is one of the lowest in the world , " he said , " and on top of that @entity2 has a very high public debt			1
" that debt stands at about 120 % of gross domestic product ( gdp ) -- or in other words , a fifth more than the country 's annual economic output -- and is one of the highest in the world , bar that of @entity47 , which has had to be bailed out by @entity30			1
put these two factors together in @entity2 and it " becomes clear that the economy is not going to be able to generate enough resources to pay for its debt , " @entity58 said			2
professor @entity88 of the @entity89 told @entity0 that while @entity31 's public return to the helm on the economy was welcome after a conspicuous absence , @entity2 's mercurial prime minister is also a part of the problem			1
@entity2 under @entity31 has failed to " grasp the nettle of economic reform " to tackle low growth over a sustained period , @entity88 said			1
in addition , he said , @entity31 erred in july by publicly criticizing finance minister @entity101 ( who is himself troubled by corruption allegations ) over recently announced austerity measures			2
" as soon as you start playing these kind of games politically , the markets smell blood and as soon as they scent it , they start tearing flesh , " @entity88 said			0
he argues that @entity2 should not be in trouble in the first place because although its debt is high , it is not rising			0
also , the public - sector deficit -- the gap between taxation and expenditure -- is very low at 4 % compared with other countries , such as 10 % in the @entity120 and 11 % in the @entity121			0
@entity2 is n't exposed to the same kind of property bubble as @entity124 and its banking system is strong , @entity88 said			0
but other elements , like the new debt deals agreed for @entity47 , @entity128 and @entity48 , have paradoxically pushed up borrowing costs for @entity2 to record levels -- with bond yields , or interest rates on government debt , reaching 6 % -- and put it under greater pressure , he said			2
unlike @entity135 , @entity88 believes @entity2 is highly unlikely to default on its huge debt -- but its situation is nonetheless " precarious " if it wants to avoid years of low growth			0
and the picture is not altogether bleak			0
unemployment in @entity2 , at just over 8 % , is not as high as in @entity124 or @entity47 , @entity88 said , giving more leeway for the government to carry out tough reforms and the economy to be turned round			0
@entity0 's @entity146 contributed to this report .			0
