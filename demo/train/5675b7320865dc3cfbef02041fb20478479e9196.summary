@entity0 canceled classes wednesday after a student protest sparked a threatening backlash on a campus online forum , according to a college spokesman			1
on friday , current @entity0 students interrupted a welcome show for recently admitted students by chanting about aspects of student life they found troubling , such as issues around homophobia and sexual assault on campus			1
the welcome show was designed to highlight why the prospective students should attend @entity0 , college spokesman @entity15 said			1
the decision to cancel classes was prompted by a series of threatening and abusive online posts that targeted the students who protested at the welcome show , a letter sent to @entity0 students and faculty said			1
the online postings appeared on @entity28 , a @entity0 - exclusive forum where students post about happenings on campus , according to student @entity33 , 22			1
the website has since been shut down			0
comments on the website included derogatory , homophobic , racist , and sexist remarks directed at the student protesters			2
threats of violence and sexual assault also appeared			0
although student protesters expected campus - wide reaction , they say were not anticipating the level of hostility they experienced			1
" i think that all of us knew what we were getting ourselves into when we decided to protest this , but i do n't think any of us expected to receive such extreme threats of death and rape and lynching , " said @entity47 , 20			0
college administrators announced that classes would be replaced by " alternative programming " for the college community " to discuss @entity0 's commitment to fostering debate that promotes respect for individuals , civil and engaged discourse , and the value of diverse opinions			1
" " we feel it is necessary for the community as a whole to have the opportunity to learn about all that has transpired and to discuss further action that will help us live up to our mission , " the letter stated			0
the alternative programming included a large meeting of faculty , a discussion facilitated by a social justice and diversity consultant , a community gathering , lunch and smaller ' teach - in ' discussions led by @entity0 faculty and staff			1
however , student protesters are unsatisfied with the administration 's reaction to recent events			0
" we 've made petitions and nothing has changed			0
our previous efforts have really fallen on deaf ears			0
they have n't reached out to us and they have n't taken a stance on the protest , " @entity47 said			0
@entity0 president @entity99 did not immediately respond to @entity101 's requests for comment			2
however , college administrators told students that the decision to hold alternative programming in lieu of classes was not made lightly			2
" together , we will make this day an important step toward realizing a better @entity0 , " the letter said			2
according to @entity15 , none of the students who disrupted the event or posted online are being sought by law enforcement			1
