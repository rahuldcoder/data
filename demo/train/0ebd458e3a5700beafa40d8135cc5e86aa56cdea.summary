-- imagine a country where no one can find a job and everyone is younger than 25			0
this country , which exists as a diaspora , threatens the economic vitality , social fabric and long - term stability of much of the world			0
it is a country of lost potential			0
in @entity13 , 24 % of youth are unemployed			1
the numbers are particularly bad in @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			0
they are also bad in the @entity19 and @entity20			0
unemployment is a slow - burning yet acute crisis that needs continuous attention from the world 's businesses and governments			1
the human cost is incalculable			0
jobless young people struggle to become positive contributors to their families , communities and countries			1
creating more job opportunities accelerates a virtuous cycle that boosts productivity and wages , reinforces a host of social virtues -- including greater stability , self - esteem , community commitment -- and decreases crime			0
for business , the opportunity is great			2
research indicates that for every 1 percentage point of sustained improvement in global youth employment , worldwide economic consumption increases by an estimated $ 72 billion per year			2
we believe leaders in business , government and civil society should make a collaborative , concerted and cohesive effort to address unemployment with urgency in 2014			1
we 've asked the 120 global @entity58 who make up the @entity60 's @entity59 to join us in a new drive to reduce youth unemployment , starting this week at the @entity63 in @entity64			2
one area with significant potential is education for and through employment , including developing function - specific and behavioral skills training programs that build experience , such as innovative internships and apprenticeships			0
it is becoming increasingly clear that there is a wide and growing gap between the kinds of jobs available to new workers and the ability of young people to fill them			1
according to a recent survey of employers in nine countries ( @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , the @entity92 and the @entity93 ) , only 43 % of employers say they are able to find enough skilled entry - level workers			0
public - private cooperation in developing the work readiness of the young generation provides a clear opportunity to reduce youth unemployment			1
for example , automobile manufacturers and suppliers across more than a dozen @entity93 states are now training new workers in collaboration with 30 - plus community colleges			0
more employers are also turning to apprenticeships such as those that have long been successful in @entity86 , @entity111 and @entity112 -- three countries with traditionally low youth unemployment			2
in these countries , dual education systems combine study with work experience and their results are recognized by companies and governments alike			2
such dual education systems provide a promising path forward to young people without university degrees , create a next - generation workforce for business trained by specialists			1
these systems generally cost taxpayers less than training efforts initiated and funded wholly by government			0
these efforts are also effective in developing countries			0
for instance , since 2009 , the @entity134 -- a public - private partnership between companies , local government and @entity138 -- has equipped thousands of young @entity85 with the skills needed to find jobs in retail , recycling , entrepreneurship and more , impacting more than 70,000 people in @entity85 communities			1
in addition , global corporations can work with government and civil society to build entrepreneurship cultures inside and outside their organizations , empowering youth through training in behaviors and attitudes that will help them get things done throughout their lives , and boost employment and innovation			2
the @entity60 's @entity162 initiative is helping to create new ventures and jobs by connecting more than 3,000 of the world 's brightest young entrepreneurs with our international business council colleagues , we will be determining how to develop better data and local information on youth employment and replicate existing solutions more widely			1
with many parts of the world still struggling to reinvigorate growth , concerted efforts to help young people prepare for the workforce can help our global economy			1
we believe the time has come for international business leaders to act decisively to reduce youth unemployment and create a brighter future for all			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 and @entity187 .			1

@entity186 , @entity187 : in @entity13 and elsewhere , many young people are jobless
@entity186 , @entity192 : unemployment is an acute crisis that needs our continuous attention
they say business leaders and governments should work together on this urgent problem
@entity186 , @entity192 : for businesses , it 's an opportunity since jobs leads to consumption
