-- it has been nearly 30 years since princess @entity2 walked down the aisle at @entity4 and the world is anxious for another royal wedding of the same fairy tale proportions			0
and if @entity9 and prince @entity11 's appearance at their friends ' wedding over the weekend in @entity15 is any indication , the wait may be almost over			1
the usually publicity - shy couple arrived together for the festivities in @entity19 and even smiled for photographers when exiting the church			1
( adding fuel to the matrimonial speculation -- the couple had just returned from a safari in @entity26			0
yet another reason they look so relaxed and happy ? ) at the wedding , the always - elegant @entity9 wore a bright blue dress topped with a fitted black blazer and , in keeping with @entity33 tradition , an oversize hat -- hers accented with a feather			2
prince @entity11 wore a dapper tailcoat and purple tie			2
@entity38 : the best dressed celebrity brides @entity9 often lands on best - dressed lists for her princess - worthy fashion and , inevitably , her style is compared to prince @entity11 's mother , princess @entity2			1
surely the late princess would have approved of @entity9 's outfit on saturday -- bright pops of color and full skirts are pages right out of @entity2 's style playbook			0
like the people 's princess , @entity9 is frequently seen in well - tailored clothes that flatter her figure without ever being overly revealing or too tight			2
princess @entity2 is n't the only royal to whom @entity9 has been compared			0
among others , @entity9 takes style cues from the royals of @entity60 and shares a penchant for fedoras , as did princess @entity63 , classic trench coats a la princess @entity65 and sporty equestrian style as seen on princess @entity67 of @entity60			0
@entity38 : @entity9 's @entity69 princess style the next biggest question after when in the royal wedding guessing game is who , as in which lucky designer will nab the honors of designing @entity9 's wedding dress ? will she opt for a relatively unknown name , as did princess @entity2 when she asked @entity79 and @entity80 to design her dress ? or will she go to @entity82 who designed fellow royal @entity83 of @entity85 's dress for her big day ? perhaps to the delight of fashionistas @entity9 will work with one of @entity33 's top designers like @entity90 , @entity91 of @entity92 , or @entity93 who famously designed the dress @entity95 wore when she got jilted in the first " @entity97 " movie ? one thing is for sure , all eyes will be on @entity9 to see how her fashion choices will evolve over the years			1
she has already scored points for her ladylike , princess - appropriate style and chances are once the title is official , the rest of the world will start copying her wardrobe and a @entity109 's auction of her closet to benefit her favorite charity is inevitable ! see more of @entity9 's best looks at @entity38			1
