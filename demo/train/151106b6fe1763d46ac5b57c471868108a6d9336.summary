-- for nearly two weeks , @entity2 's body lay unclaimed at the @entity5 medical examiner 's office			1
a funeral home now has the remains and a quest is underway to find him a resting place in @entity11			1
but first , he will undergo a second " independent " autopsy demanded by his relatives , a family spokeswoman said			0
his death certificate has yet to be filed with the @entity5 city clerk , and there is no burial plot yet , according to the funeral home holding the remains			1
if no grave site is found after the second autopsy , @entity26 , the owner of the funeral home , plans to ask the government to find a grave			1
three cemeteries that @entity26 contacted said they feared reprisals , but the funeral home owner said you ca n't pick and choose when it comes to a burial			2
" this is what we do in a civilized society , regardless of the circumstances , " @entity26 said			0
" as i told some of them , at the immediate moment you may fear ( reprisal ) , but later on , when things calm down , people are going to resent you because you did n't do it			2
" @entity2 died on april 19 after he and his brother shot a university police officer to death , carjacked an suv and hurled bombs at officers pursuing them , according to authorities			1
a few days earlier -- april 15 -- he and his younger brother , @entity54 , allegedly bombed the @entity55 , killing three and wounding more than 260			2
@entity0 obtained a copy of @entity2 's death certificate , which lists the cause of death as " gunshot wounds of torso and extremities " and " blunt trauma to head and torso			1
" the document notes that @entity2 was shot by police and run over and dragged by a car			2
it lists the manner of death as homicide , and denotes that he was " doa , " or dead on arrival			1
authorities have said his younger brother may have run him over as they resisted arrest days after the marathon attacks			0
separately , 12 people remained hospitalized with bombing - related injuries on saturday , according to a count by @entity0			0
none were in serious condition			0
also , the frantic manhunt two weeks ago for the surviving bombing suspect drew the attention of gun rights advocates at their convention in @entity90			2
@entity92 executive vice president @entity91 said residents were " imprisoned " in their homes with no means to protect themselves while police searched for the younger @entity2			2
" how many @entity97 wished they had a gun two weeks ago ? " he asked			0
when brave law enforcement officers did their job in that city so courageously , good guys with guns stopped terrorists with guns , " he said			0
' everyone deserves to be buried ' @entity2 's body remained unclaimed until thursday , when an uncle , who had previously publicly condemned his alleged attacks , had a funeral parlor pick up the body			1
the uncle , @entity113 resident @entity112 , had decried the alleged bombers as " losers " after the attacks			0
their parents in @entity120 have said they will not fly his body back to @entity122 for burial , spokeswoman @entity117 said			0
@entity0 affiliate @entity124 reported that the hearse that picked up @entity2 's body ferried it to a funeral home 30 miles away from @entity5 , near the @entity128 state line			1
residents of @entity131 , @entity11 , took to the streets to boo @entity2 , when they heard about the presence of the corpse in their town , @entity129 reported			2
others took to social media to vent anger at the funeral home for accepting the body			2
it was later transported to @entity26 's funeral home , @entity143 in @entity144			2
" everyone deserves to be buried , " he said			0
the marathon bombings authorities say the brothers carried out the @entity55 bombings using explosive devices made of pressure cookers			0
@entity54 , 19 , is being held at a federal @entity153 medical facility in @entity154 , @entity11 , charged with using a weapon of mass destruction , which carries the death penalty			1
he is being treated for gunshot wounds to the head , neck , legs and hands that he received in the shootout with police that led to his brother 's death			1
investigators found explosives residue in the apartment that the elder @entity2 shared with his wife and young daughter , a source briefed on the investigation said friday			1
it has turned up in at least three places at the small apartment in @entity177 , @entity11 , the source said : the kitchen table , the kitchen sink and the bathtub			1
@entity54 has said they built the bombs there , @entity182 law enforcement officials briefed on the progress of the investigation said			2
other target , a cover - up the marathon was not the original target , the officials said			0
the brothers had set their sights on a suicide attack on the city 's massive @entity195 celebration , which draws about 500,000 people and is televised nationally			1
but the bombs were ready sooner than anticipated and a day or two before the @entity55 , they changed their plans , the officials said			0
they spoke on the condition that their names not be used because they were not authorized to discuss the matter with the media			0
one key question involves whether intelligence , law enforcement and homeland security agencies could have done more in their investigation of @entity2 in recent years before the attack and whether they shared information effectively enough			1
an independent government review is underway			0
in an interview with @entity216 published on its website on saturday , president @entity214 said cooperation among agencies can always get better			0
but he again defended @entity182 efforts			0
" i think we can continue to improve and refine how we 're engaging and countering terrorist activity , " @entity214 said			0
" i do n't think it 's fair to say though that law enforcement dropped the ball			0
" it is very difficult to prevent attacks when dealing with individuals who are self - radicalized and not part of a massive conspiracy or network , he said about the current belief of investigators looking at the origins of the @entity5 bombing			0
@entity2 's widow , @entity236 , has remained largely out of view since her husband 's death , staying in her parents ' @entity128 home			1
her attorney , @entity242 , says the 24 - year - old knew nothing about plans to bomb the race , and reports of her husband 's involvement came as an " absolute shock " to @entity251 and her family			2
three of @entity54 's friends have been accused of covering for the bombing suspects			1
@entity256 and @entity257 , both from @entity259 , were charged wednesday with conspiring to discard potentially incriminating items from @entity54 's dorm room			1
@entity262 , a @entity182 citizen , was charged with making false statements to investigators			0
all three are accused of removing items from @entity2 's dorm room after the bombings			1
according to @entity269 affidavits released this week , they left with the backpack and @entity271 -- which @entity256 believed could be used to make bombs -- and @entity2 's laptop			1
investigators found the backpack , fireworks and @entity271 in a landfill last week after a two - day search			0
the laptop was turned over by @entity257 on april 19 , the same day the @entity269 raided the apartment he shared with @entity256 , @entity257 's attorney @entity279 said			1
the @entity269 is examining the laptop , two federal law enforcement officials told @entity0			1
authorities have said they believe the @entity2 brothers acted alone , but are investigating whether they could have learned from or have been aided by terror groups , including groups overseas			2
@entity0 's @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 and @entity294 contributed to this report .			0
