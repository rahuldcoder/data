@entity0 -- @entity2 will spell out that its @entity4 bottled water is made with tap water , a concession to the growing environmental and political opposition to the bottled water industry			1
according to @entity11 , a @entity12 watchdog group , the world 's no. 2 beverage company will include the words " @entity15 " on @entity4 labels			1
@entity16 's @entity4 bottled water and @entity19 's @entity18 are made from purified tap water			1
" if this helps clarify the fact that the water originates from public sources , then it 's a reasonable thing to do , " said @entity21 , a @entity22 spokeswoman			0
@entity16 chief executive @entity28 told @entity1 earlier this week the company was considering such a move			0
@entity16 's @entity4 and @entity31 's @entity18 are both made from purified water sourced from public reservoirs , as opposed to @entity35 's @entity36 or @entity38 's @entity37 , so - called " spring waters , " shipped from specific locations the companies say have notably clean water			1
@entity31 told @entity1 it will start posting online information about the quality control testing it performs on @entity18 by the end of summer or early fall			0
" concerns about the bottled - water industry , and increasing corporate control of water , are growing across the country , " said @entity46 , director of the " @entity11 " campaign , which aims to encourage people to drink tap water			1

@entity62 , @entity63 passed a resolution banning commercially bottled water at city events and @entity67 , @entity61 asked department heads to eliminate bottled water			2
critics charge the bottled water industry adds plastic to landfills , uses too much energy by producing and shipping bottles across the world and undermines confidence in the safety and cleanliness of public water supplies , all while much of the world 's population is without access to clean water			1
but industry observers said such opposition is unlikely to drain @entity12 sales of bottled water , which reached 2.6 billion cases in 2006 , according to @entity90			2
the industry newsletter estimated that @entity12 consumers spent about $ 15 billion on bottled water last year			2
" consumers have an affection for bottled water			0
it 's not an issue of taste or health , it 's about convenience , " the newsletter 's publisher , @entity96 , said			0
" try walking up ( @entity0 's ) @entity103 on a hot day and getting a glass of tap water			2
" @entity106 , a portfolio manager at @entity107 , said the environmental objections will have little impact on the bottom line for either @entity16 or @entity31 , though he admitted it could slow the market 's growth rate			0
" @entity16 and @entity31 do not make a lot of profit " on bottled water , said @entity106 , adding that people may talk about the issue , but will likely continue buying some bottled water			1
@entity107 owns about 3 million shares of @entity2 among its $ 62 billion under management			0
