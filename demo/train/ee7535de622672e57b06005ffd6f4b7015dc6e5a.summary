@entity0 has made a lot of noise lately telling the world how much the @entity5 has changed when it comes to respecting women			1
the commissioner tells us he has had an epiphany since his botched decision - making in the @entity13 domestic abuse case and the resulting backlash from well beyond the sports world			2
since then , @entity0 said he has visited shelters and spoken to abused women and saw the pain and despair that come to families when women are not valued			1
his mission is to make amends			2
he 's updated the personal conduct rules to include a mandatory , six - game , unpaid suspension for personnel who violate the league 's domestic abuse policy			2
and @entity0 wants to make it absolutely clear that the @entity5 culture has no room for abusive attitudes or behavior toward women -- who are the fastest - growing @entity5 demographic , making up 45 % of the more than 150 million @entity38 fans			1
but strangely , that changed man was nowhere in sight this week as @entity0 responded with not only disrespect but disdain when @entity1 reporter @entity45 respectfully questioned him during the @entity5 @entity47 press conference during @entity48 week in @entity49			1
@entity45 was correct to ask @entity0 about the league 's conflict - of - interest problem as it pertains to the internal investigation process in cases of domestic abuse , or allegations of cheating on the field , such as @entity58			1
" when you do something like hire an outside investigator like @entity59 into the @entity64 investigation , you 're still paying him and @entity65 , who owns the @entity64 , is paying you , " @entity45 said , referring to @entity59 , who is investigating @entity58			1
" what steps can you guys take in the future to mitigate some of those conflict - of - interest issues ? " @entity45 was spot on			1
not only did she raise a legitimate concern but she struck at the heart of the " integrity " issue plaguing the league			0
an issue @entity0 says he wants to address			1
but it seems he only wants to address the problem on his own terms			0
" somebody has to pay them , @entity83 , and unless you 're volunteering , which i do n't think you are , we will , " was @entity0 's snarky and condescending response			1
@entity0 has a lot to learn			2
the first step toward respecting women begins in the workplace -- valuing our voices , our intelligence , and our hard work -- especially when it goes against the grain in a male - dominated culture			2
our innovation should be encouraged			0
clearly , the commissioner is struggling with this part			0
instead , @entity0 gave viewers a look at what happens to women in his workplace when they dare to challenge norms , or challenge him			1
hearing @entity0 's response , i cringed			1
and if @entity107 is any indicator , so did many women and many men who understand the code language of the @entity112			2
@ espn1420 tweeted : " so , @entity0 got defensive , then he actually attacked @entity115 ' integrity ... getting a little nervous , mr. @entity116 ? " from @ janesports : " given that @entity45 is trending , i 'd say @entity0 undermined that message of humility and change			1
# @entity5 " for many women who 've worked in corporate america , @entity0 's chastising sounded familiar			1
we have all been there			0
the belittling comes in many forms			0
and it is often constant			0
for me , while at @entity130 , it was a senior colleague who liked to speak for me at meetings whenever he thought an idea i suggested or a comment i made was out of line and did not fit his agenda			0
" what @entity139 means is ... " he 'd offer with a chuckle , before completely taking over the conversation			0
never mind that we were n't friendly enough for him to give me a pet name , or , that he could have no possible idea what i meant since we 'd never spoken about the topic at hand			0
it took me a few years to build enough confidence to counter my colleague , by saying -- ' no actually , i meant exactly what i said			0
but thank you for having my back on this ... ' luckily for me , most of the men i worked with at @entity130 were respectful and supportive			0
pet names , talking over you , and belittling your questions as @entity0 did with @entity45 , are common strategies men sometimes use to degrade women in the workplace and label us not ready to play with the big boys			1
@entity45 handled @entity0 's slight with grace			1
she said nothing and instead let him indict himself with a string of sarcastic comments			0
everyone in that room knew @entity0 was out of line			2
and worse , his comments were bad for business			0
the @entity5 's future depends on women			1
in fact , from 2009 to 2013 , female viewership overall was up 26 % , compared with an 18 % rise for men			0
yes , women are changing the game			2
but we realize that shifting a culture is not easy			0
long - held attitudes will not disappear overnight			0
but with the right leadership , change can slowly happen one day at a time , one mind at a time			0
so let 's give the commissioner credit			2
he 's realized that negative attitudes about women need to change around the league			2
it just has n't dawned on him yet how closely we are all listening and watching his every move			0
and it will take more than a compelling tv commercial and star - studded , multimillion - dollar marketing campaign to convince women that the @entity5 is serious about respecting us			1
@entity0 will have to show us that his own actions can live up to his lofty words .			1
