-- @entity2 's octogenarian incumbent president is seeking a third term sunday , a bid that has sparked deadly protests and threatened the nation 's reputation as one of the most stable democracies in @entity10			1
the incumbent @entity12 , 85 , came to power in 2000 after multiple unsuccessful runs			1
one of the continent 's oldest leaders , the @entity16 - trained lawyer also has a degree in economics			0
he is seeking a third term against a crowded field of 13 others , including two women			0
he was initially credited with boosting the nation 's infrastructure , but his critics have accused him of autocracy and said he is grooming his son to take over after him			0
others have accused the leader of grandiose investments , including a costly towering monument near the capital of @entity35 that sparked criticism in a country where poverty is still rife			0
other contenders include @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 , the latter of whom considered @entity12 a mentor			2
why are protesters against his run ? @entity2 protesters have taken to the streets nationwide since @entity12 won a court bid to run for a third term despite a constitutional limit mandating two terms			1
@entity12 successfully argued that he is exempt because he took office before the term limit was put in place			1
@entity12 is among a list of elderly leaders clinging to power in @entity10 despite demands for them to step down			1
@entity62 president @entity61 used his recent 88th birthday to lash out at critics and vowed to run for re-election			0
the opposition has said it will protest if @entity12 wins , but analysts say a lack of cohesion among foes and a system that favors the incumbent make it harder to unseat @entity12 , who is nicknamed the " hare " for his shrewd politics			1
" opposition in @entity2 is weak due to a lack of interest , resolve and an unfair political and electoral system that 's hell bent on guaranteeing @entity12 's presidency , " said @entity76 , an analyst on @entity10			1
who is behind the protests ? grammy - award winning @entity2 musician @entity84 is one of the forces behind the demonstrations			1
last month , the constitutional court barred the singer from running for president , sparking more outrage on the streets			0
the court said he did not have enough signatures for his application to be valid , which he denies			0
other leaders , entertainers and groups have joined the movement to block @entity12 's bid for a third term			1
an opposition coalition dubbed @entity104 has galvanized the protests and maintained the momentum as opposition candidates resumed campaigning			0
the june 23 movement , or @entity104 , is named after the date of a major protest last year against a constitutional amendment that would almost guarantee @entity12 victory			2
why is @entity2 considered a stable democracy ? @entity2 gained independence from @entity116 in 1960 , and is one of the few nations in @entity118 that has not had a coup			2
past elections have included a smooth transition of power , a rarity in a continent with a history of election chaos , civil wars and coups			1
its democracy is rooted in history -- even as a @entity16 colony , @entity2 had representatives in parliament			2
" elections in @entity2 have previously been peaceful , " @entity76 said			2
" currently , there is a lot of tension , anxiety , and protesters are already having running battles with police forces loyal to @entity12			2
this would have been previously unthinkable			0
" the @entity2 are becoming " more daring and resolute " in their quest to oust @entity12 , the analyst said			1
@entity146 headed for re-election ? analysts say a divided opposition vote makes it easier for him to coast through			0
" there are 13 presidential candidates with different ideologies and political differences ... making it easy for @entity12 to streak through a third term , " @entity76 said			2
" however , if voting goes to a second round , a weakened @entity12 will find it difficult to win			0
" @entity12 would have stiff competition if parties consolidate their vote and rally against one candidate , he said			0
conflict in the south also an issue despite its badge of honor as a stable democracy , a decades - long separatist rebellion in the southern region of @entity174 remains unresolved			0
the government and rebel leaders have signed a peace accord in the past , and @entity12 promised to end the conflict when he took over , but the simmering tensions have blemished the nation 's reputation .			1
