@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , founder of @entity4 , has been scouring the world 's biggest mobile technology show in @entity0 for the latest gadgets and innovations			1
here are the gadgets that caught his eye : a cinema experience on your phone : @entity14 800 7.1 surround demo , by @entity16 there was a time when a mobile phone speaker was a joke			1
but things are changing , and phones and tablets due out in the second half of 2013 will pack a number of features designed to give them enough power to become your home entertainment hub			0
the new @entity14 processor comes with the ability to replicate a 7.1 surround sound speaker system -- even through a pair of standard headphones			1
dubbed @entity35 : @entity37 , the technology is very clever , especially when you add in the processor 's ability to play 4k video			1
better photography : @entity44 4i @entity43 camera demo @entity44 is @entity14 's biggest challenger in the mobile processor space			1
aside from games - the company is due to launch its own @entity44 4 - powered @entity51 console called @entity52 later this year -- it has been showing off real - time @entity54 photography capabilities that automatically adjust a picture for light and dark areas on the fly			2
it 's something that today 's cameras struggle to do , and certainly something where you need lots of power under the hood			2
a superior tablet : @entity68 there are many tablets on show at @entity72 this year , including ones that are also trying to be a phone			1
the @entity68 caught my eye for a number of reasons			1
firstly it 's a real change in product design from @entity68 -- in a good way -- but secondly the tablet , like the company 's new @entity80 phone , is waterproof , making it ideal for the bath , or those that find themselves working out and about in tough conditions			1
tell us : what 's your dream smartphone feature ? safer shopping with a paddle paddle is a shopping system that tries to make shopping online easier and safer			2
the idea is that e-commerce sites add a " buy with paddle " button at the checkout , simplifying the payment process			2
it does this by generating a qr code for you to read with a dedicated app on your phone			0
once you scan the code , all the merchant details are ready for you to check , and because the app has all your payment details , all that 's left is for you to press " buy			0
" the fact that you have to scan a qr code on the screen also means there is an extra level of security			0
it 's currently being internally tested by @entity123 in the @entity124			0
streaming music in cars : @entity127 @entity127 has teamed up with @entity128 to bring the music - streaming service to its @entity131 cars in @entity132 , starting with the @entity133 later in the year			1
@entity134 allows drivers to control smartphone apps from the driver 's seat , using voice control			0
understanding voice in the car is going to be one of the key battlegrounds for cars in the near future			0
@entity146 says it has spent a lot of time making sure the @entity133 has a good microphone and the capacity to actually hear the instructions you give , meaning you can keep your eyes on the road and your hands on the wheel			0
read more : how your phone will know when you 're sick a mobile phone that is ... a phone : @entity162 105 while the flagship handsets get more and more powerful , @entity162 is n't forgetting those that do n't need a 5 - inch display , a powerful processor , or the ability to download a play a host of games			1
it has launched a phone that costs just â ‚ ¬ 15 ( about $ 20 ) and has 35 days of stand - by from a single charge			1
what 's clever is that it 's a phone that is actually just a phone			1
sometimes keeping things simple really works			0
free apps on your phone : @entity179 when the original @entity181 launched , it did n't have apps , it had web apps -- free programs that bring the best of the web to your phone			2
@entity187 soon realised that a better and more lucrative way of doing things was to create paid - for apps , and the rest is history			0
jump forward five years and @entity192 , the organization behind the firefox browser is trying to bring back free web based apps with a mobile operating system completely built on @entity196			2
the beauty here is that the os will be free , and the handsets need n't be powerful			0
with lots of backing from major players , it 's already punching above its weight			0
certainly one to watch .			0

among new gadgets *showcased* in @entity0 is a processor that can deliver surround sound from a mobile phone
@entity68 's new @entity212 is waterproof , making it idea for the bath or inclement weather
@entity127 has teamed up with @entity128 to bring the music - streaming service to some if its cars in @entity132
