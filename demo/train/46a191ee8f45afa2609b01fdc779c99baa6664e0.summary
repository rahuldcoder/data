-- @entity1 woud some of us bea withoot spell check ? the sometimes annoying , but frankly indispensable computer aid has spared billions of typographical blushes			2
now , an ingenious prototype pen developed by a @entity9 start - up is promising to give our longhand writing a similar sort of safety net			1
@entity13 ( @entity9 for " learning pen " ) is a digital pen with a difference , carrying not only ink inside its casing but also a tiny computer that alerts users to spelling errors			1
@entity22 , co-founder of @entity23 told @entity0 : " basically there are two functions			0
the calligraphy mode which helps you correct individual letters , and the orthography mode which vibrates when a word is misspelled			1
" the @entity33 - powered @entity32 computer includes a vibration module and a patent pending non-optical motion sensor which recognizes specific movements and shapes of letters and words			1
the pen employs a menagerie of sensors , including a gyroscope ( for measuring orientation ) , accelerometer ( for calculating propulsion ) and magnetometer ( a device that measures the strength and direction of magnetic fields ) -- all to calculate the pen 's @entity54 movements			2
interactive : the future of 3d printing @entity13 recognizes all writing movements , the company says , written on paper or in the air and built - in @entity63 allows scribblers to connect with smartphones , computers or other pens in a network			1
the pen was invented by software developer and @entity23 founder @entity71 after seeing his wife 's frustrations at watching their son struggle with his homework			2
why ca n't pens give instant feedback on mistakes ? she asked			2
his imagination fired , @entity85 set about constructing a prototype before assembling a team of hardware and software experts late last year			0
" we are at the stage where the individual components do their job			0
we have n't put it together yet , but the response to the idea though has been overwhelming , " @entity22 said			0
the pen has been designed primarily as an educational tool and the @entity100 - based company are hopeful that dyslexic children will find the new pen particularly useful			1
@entity103 , professor @entity104 at the @entity107 's @entity106 gave the pen a cautious welcome			0
" it 's a neat idea in principle , but as ever the proof will be in the using of it , " @entity103 said via email			0
" will it learn individuals ' quirks of handwriting , or insist on one style ? i can see how it might be programmed to spot obvious spelling errors ( non-words ) , just as the spellcheckers in word processors do -- but none of those can yet cope with real - word errors			1
" a @entity130 campaign recently got underway looking to raise £ 120,000 ( $ 180,000 ) and tests in schools will begin later this year			0
the first pens will initially recognize only @entity135 and @entity9 spellings , but other languages will follow , says @entity22			1
" learning your native language is one thing , but it 's also the perfect tool to adapt for foreign language students , " he says			0
" from a cultural point of view , the pen is a wonderful bridge between cursive and technological worlds			0
" eventually , the company plan to offer pencil , fountain and ballpoint pen options with a launch price between € 120 - 150 ( $ 160 - 200 ) falling to under € 50 ( $ 60 ) depending on how fast the company grows .			2
