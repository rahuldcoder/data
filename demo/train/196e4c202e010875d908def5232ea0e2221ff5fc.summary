@entity0 -- president @entity2 will sign sweeping health care reform legislation into law at the @entity5 on tuesday , according to two @entity7 officials familiar with the planning			1
@entity2 also will hit the road to sell the measure to a still - skeptical public , giving a speech thursday in @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity5 press secretary @entity9 said			1
@entity2 launched his grass - roots drive for health care reform in @entity14 in may 2007 , according to @entity9			1
the bill , which constitutes the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees in more than four decades , passed the @entity21 late sunday night with no @entity23 support			1
it was approved by the @entity25 in december			0
a separate compromise package of changes also passed the @entity5 on sunday and still needs to be approved by the @entity25			2
the officials noted that the @entity25 can not begin debate on the package before @entity2 signs the underlying bill into law			1
passage of the bill was a huge boost for @entity2 , who made health care reform a domestic priority			1
aides said monday that @entity2 exchanged handshakes , hugs and " high - fives " with staffers when the outcome of the @entity5 vote became apparent			2
" i have n't seen the president so happy about anything other than his family since i 've known him , " said senior adviser @entity45 , adding that @entity2 's jubilation sunday night exceeded his election victory in november 2008			1
" he was excited that night , but not like last night			0
" republicans promised to continue fighting the reforms , with 11 state attorneys general -- all @entity23 -- planning lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the bill 's mandate for people to buy health insurance and requirements for states to comply with its provisions			1
senior republicans in @entity64 warned that voters will judge @entity7 harshly in november 's midterm elections , with sen. @entity67 of @entity68 saying the @entity7 - passed bill killed any chance of bipartisan support on legislation for the rest of the year			2
" there will be no cooperation for the rest of this year , " @entity67 said in an interview with @entity76 radio in @entity68			0
" they have poisoned the well in what they have done and how they have done it			0
" highlights of what 's in the bill @entity5 press secretary @entity9 , however , said the administration expects to win any lawsuits filed against the bill , and he challenged @entity67 and other @entity23 to campaign for the november election against benefits of the health care bill such as tax credits for small businesses and an end to insurance company practices such as denying coverage for pre-existing conditions			1
the overall $ 940 billion plan is projected to extend insurance coverage to roughly 32 million additional @entity102			1
most @entity102 will now be required to have health insurance or pay a fine			0
larger employers will be required to provide coverage or risk financial penalties			0
@entity109 coverage limits will be banned , and insurers will be barred from denying coverage based on gender or pre-existing conditions			0
the compromise package would add to the bill 's total cost partly by expanding insurance subsidies for middle - and lower - income families			2
the measure would scale back the bill 's taxes on expensive insurance plans			0
@entity5 @entity7 are expected to celebrate passage of the bill at a news conference with reform advocates tuesday afternoon			1
secretary of state @entity127 , who spearheaded her husband 's failed health reform effort in the 1990s , said earlier in the day that @entity2 's success was an example of the president 's tenacity			1
" if you ever doubt the resolve of president @entity2 to stay with a job , look at what we got done for the @entity102 last night when it came to passing quality affordable health care for everyone , " @entity134 said during a speech to the @entity136			1
was it all worth it for @entity2 ? observers warn , however , that the road ahead for health care reform in the @entity25 may be rocky			1
@entity7 leaders are using a legislative maneuver called reconciliation , which will allow the compromise plan to clear the @entity25 with a simple majority of 51 votes			2
but according to @entity25 rules , members are still allowed to offer unlimited amendments and challenges			0
in one of the first of many attempts @entity23 say they will make to try to amend or kill the package , @entity23 aides went to @entity167 @entity166 on monday to argue that the compromise bill violates rules of the reconciliation process because of the way it affects @entity173			2
for that reason , @entity23 aides said they argued , the bill should not even be allowed to be debated			2
however , @entity166 , according to a senior @entity23 and a @entity7 aide , informed both parties he disagreed with the @entity23 assessment , and would not block the bill from reaching the @entity25 floor			1
" there 's hope that [ the vote ] would be done within a short period of time , like a week or so , " said @entity181 , a health economist and associate dean of public health at the @entity185 at @entity186 in @entity187 , @entity188			0
" but the @entity25 is complicated and does n't have the discipline that the @entity5 does			0
" once the package hits the @entity25 floor , the chamber 's rules stipulate that there must be 20 hours of debate			2
but that 20 hours may prove to be more of a suggestion than an indicator of what will happen , according to @entity203 , a law professor at @entity186 's @entity204			0
" it could get all messy and could go on forever if [ @entity23 ] threw up amendment after amendment , " @entity203 said			0
" theoretically , it should only take 20 hours , but it will likely take longer because @entity23 have things up their sleeve			0
" if any provision in the package of changes is rejected or changed , the entire package would then have to go back to the @entity5 for another vote			0
@entity216 : share your views on health care reform @entity5 @entity7 unhappy with the @entity25 bill have been continually reassured that the compromise package will be approved by the more conservative @entity25			1
senate majority leader @entity222 , @entity223 , presented a letter to @entity5 @entity7 on saturday stating that their @entity25 counterparts " believe that health insurance reform can not wait and must not be obstructed			2
" so far , two of the 59 senators in the @entity7 caucus , @entity230 of @entity231 and @entity232 of @entity233 , have said they will oppose the compromise package			0
@entity1 's @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 and @entity238 contributed to this report .			0
